resents an external transmitter communicating with
receiver while a person (accidentally) touches the
receiver electrode.
The different scenarios listed above are repeated at differ-
ent transmit power levels. We set the output voltage of the
transmitter to 1, 2, 5 and 10 Volts. The data sent in these
experiments consists of a random bit-string of 56 bit length.
All experiments are performed twice, once with a fre-
quency sweep containing a sine wave and a second time with a
square wave, to determine if the shape of the waveform plays a
role in how the channel characteristics are elicited. Sine waves
are a straightforward way to measure channel properties, but
the study in [32] successfully applied short square pulses to
intra-body communication using capacitive coupling. Since a
frequency sweep with a square wave corresponds to a series
of pulses of different duration, we also include square waves
in our evaluation.
d) Results: We analyze a total of 1020 instances of the
scenarios described above. They encompass data transmissions
for every study participant in each of the outlined cases. The
balance of the two classes, i.e., the ratio between the number
of samples that represent the body channel and those that
represent unwanted interactions is 1:1.

characteristics of the body channel with high accuracy. If a
sine wave is used for the frequency sweep, the probability for a
misclassiﬁcation is less than 2%. All three different metrics are
consistently high which suggests that the human body channel
is very distinctive even when compared to the various other
ways of interacting with the receiver. The results also show
that the extracted characteristics are consistent across different
people, regardless whether the study participants are sitting
or standing. The body pose does not have a signiﬁcant effect
on the body channel. Figure 10 shows the receiver operating
characteristic curve, representing body channel transmissions
as positive samples and unwanted interactions as negative
samples. Both curves are very close to each other, with “sitting
only” slightly outperforming the other. The classiﬁer can be
tuned by setting the operation point to any point on the curve.

in assigning a new sample to the class of body channel
characteristics and is more likely to reject it as an unwanted
interaction.
If a square wave is used for the frequency sweep, the
classiﬁer does not perform as well as for a sine wave. An

explanation for this behavior is the fact that a square wave
generates more spectral components in the high frequency
range. These frequencies are mostly transmitted through the
air and therefore do not capture any of the distinctiveness of
the human body channel.
In order to understand what scenarios exhibit channel char-
acteristics that come closest to the actual body channel, we list
the scenarios according to their likelihood for misclassiﬁcation
in Table III. We see that, if the participant is in contact with
the touch-electrode of the receiver, but only hovers over the
transmitter electrode, the channel characteristics are similar to
the actual body channel. This is result is not surprising, because
the additional distance between the body and the transmitter
electrode will increase the capacitance of the channel, but not
signiﬁcantly change other physical properties of the channel.
Capacitive coupling still works even if the body is not in direct
contact with the emitter of the signal. If an external transmitter

actual body channel to an extent. Table III shows that the
rod antenna and the aluminum sheet are more successful in
establishing a body channel if they are closer to receiver or
the person. At a distance of more than 60 cm the chance of
matching the body channel characteristics becomes negligi-
ble, assuming the transmitted signal corresponds to what the
receiver expects, i.e., a frequency sweep from 0.5 MHz to
3.5 MHz. We investigate the case of an attacker changing the
waveform for signal injection in the following section.
B. External Signal Injection
We have shown that the human body channel can be char-
acterized on the basis of its frequency dependent attenuation
pattern. We now approach the question if the body channel is
read only from the perspective of the second statement: Can
attacker transmit from an external source and by manipulating
the signal, make it appear as if it was sent on the body channel?
To answer this question we make a number of observations.
The ﬁrst observation is that an attacker has two options, inject
his own message on the body channel or modify another
message. If he injects an entire message, he has to make
sure that all frequency sweeps included in the message match
the body channel characteristics. If the attacker’s goal is to
modify another message, he has to inject at least a part of a
message. The messages on the body channel transmitter are
Manchester coded and every bit of transmitted data consists
of a period where power is on and off. Therefore, even
to change a single bit, the attacker has to inject a signal
that matches a frequency sweep emitted by a body channel
transmitter. Regardless whether the attacker injects an entire
message or modiﬁes another message, if the injection of a
single sweep fails, then the message is automatically rejected
by the classiﬁer, because at least part of the signal has a
different signature. We therefore focus on the injection of a
single sweep signal in the following.
We also note that changing the overall transmit power does
not help an attacker since a constant shift in the attenuation
pattern (e.g., achieved by increasing the power of the trans-
mitter) is removed during the normalization of the extracted
features.
We divide signal injection attempts into the near and far
ﬁeld based on the attacker’s distance to the body channel
receiver. Near and far ﬁeld deﬁne the behavior of the elec-
tromagnetic ﬁeld around a receiving or transmitting antenna.
In the far ﬁeld “normal” electromagnetic radiation is dominant,
whereas in the near ﬁeld the electromagnetic ﬁeld is mostly
determined by non-radiative and quasi-static effects, such as
capacitive coupling. For the purpose of our analysis, we deﬁne
the boundary between near and far ﬁeld to be where capacitive
coupling becomes ineffective.
a) Far ﬁeld: An attacker in the far ﬁeld has to send a
signal that matches the body channel signature like an attacker
from the near ﬁeld. However, an attacker in the far ﬁeld can not
rely on capacitive coupling because the electric ﬁeld generated
by electrostatic effects falls off with distance cubed [38]. The
attacker has to resort to radio frequency transmission, but
transmitting on the frequency band of 0.5 to 3.5 MHz at a
power level such that the signal is picked up by the receiver

simpliﬁed to three connected cylinders. The cylinders are further divided into
smaller units. Each unit can be modeled with a capacitor and a resistor in
parallel, plus coupling capacitance to ground.
electrode (or the human body, provided a person is touching the
electrode) is not feasible. The electrodes as well as the person
are by far from an optimal antenna for such low frequencies.
The human body does have an antenna effect because of
its size [9], but at wavelengths on the order of 100 m it is
not viable to induce a ﬁeld strength at the receiver electrode
that would result in a signal greater than thermal noise. Unless
the transmitter is highly directional and has an output power
in excess of 100 W, an attacker can not inject a meaningful
signal,
let alone a signal with a signature resembling the
characteristics of the body channel. Aiming the antenna at the
receiver further increases the complexity of an attack from the
far ﬁeld as well as signal propagation phenomenons such as
multipathing that cause interference and fading.
b) Near ﬁeld: Electrostatic coupling, such as capacitive
coupling, has the highest chance of success for signal injection.
Electrostatic effects diminish with the cube of the distance, but
if an attacker is close enough to the receiver (or the person
touching the receiver electrode), he can mitigate the attenuation
by increasing the output power of his transmitter.
Capacitive coupling works by electrostatically coupling a
current into the human body. The air gap between body and
transmitter acts as a capacitor and the larger the gap, the higher
its capacitance. A high capacitance results in a high-pass ﬁlter
with a higher cut-off frequency and the lower frequencies are
attenuated signiﬁcantly.
The attacker can overcome this attenuation in two different
ways: increase the output power at the transmitter and increase
the surface area of the transmitter. This is congruent with the
ﬁnding in Section VIII-A, where we show that the channel

aluminum sheet with a large surface area is connected to the
transmitter instead of a rod antenna. Following this reasoning,
an external
transmitter needs to have high power, a large
surface area and be placed close to the receiver.
c) Network Model for Body Channel: In order to un-
derstand if signal injections from the near ﬁeld are feasible,
we build a lumped network model for the body channel which
is inspired by [9]. The model approximates the human body
as three cylinders, one for the torso and two for each arm (see
Figure 11). The cylinders are subdivided into units for which
an approximation of the electric circuit can be given. Each
unit can be modeled with a capacitor and a resistor in parallel,
plus coupling capacitance to ground. The units for torso and
arms have the same electric circuit, but different parameters.
The length of a unit is 10 cm for both, arm and torso. The
diameter of an arm is 10 cm and the diameter of the torso is
30 cm, respectively. Based on these dimensions, the values for
capacitance and resistance per unit can be calculated from the
dielectric properties of biological tissues [11].
Using this model the body channel transmitter and receiver
can be attached anywhere on the human body, i.e., to any unit
block of the model, and the resulting transmission characteris-
tics can be computed readily. If we attach the transmitter to one
hand and the receiver to the other hand, we obtain an accurate
approximation of the body channel characteristics. Figure 12
demonstrates that the computed characteristics (striped area)
correspond well with actual body channel measurements.
To simulate an external transmitter that does not directly
touch the body, we can attach the transmitter at multiple
coherent blocks of the network model to take into account
the distance between body and transmitter. The further away
the transmitter is the larger the area that is affected by the
capacitive coupling. In addition to that, the air coupling capac-
itance between body and transmitter decreases, as the distance
between transmitter and human body increases. Figure 12
shows the computed channel characteristics (solid shaded area)
when simulating a large aluminum sheet (25 cm by 80 cm)
aimed at the person from behind at a distance of 30 cm.
Comparing the results with actual measurements, we ﬁnd that
the model approximates the channel characteristics very well.
Both, the computed approximations as well as the actual
measurements, make it evident that the channel characteris-
tics for an external source, such as an aluminum sheet, are
signiﬁcantly different from the body channel. For an attacker
to successfully inject a signal, he has to change the output
power of his transmitter based on the currently transmitted
frequency, i.e., in order to make the injected signal match the
body channel signature, the attacker has to constantly vary the
power of his transmitter. Taking the example in Figure 12, the
attacker has to transmit at a low power output at 0.5 MHz and
gradually increase the power until reaching 0.8 MHz. Then he
has to back off sharply, only to gradually increase the power
again for higher frequencies. We claim that this is not feasible
due to two reasons.
•
The attacker does not know the exact channel charac-
teristics his transmitter creates and he can not measure
them as this would require physical access.
Fig. 12. Dotted lines represent attenuation patterns of the body channel
obtained from two different people. Solid lines depict signal injections with
an aluminum sheet. Bottom red line represents an attempt where the sheet is 5
cm further away from the body. Shaded areas show approximations using the
lumped network model for a human with a body height between 155 and 195
cm (striped/top area depicts body channel and solid/bottom area represents
external transmitter).
•
The attacker can try to precompute the channel char-
acteristics, but this is likely to be inaccurate, since the
attenuation pattern is very volatile.
In order to compute the channel properties, the adversary
has to estimate the distance to the body as well as the location
and size of the area on the body where capacitive coupling
induces a current. Our experiments and the data simulated
by the model demonstrate that the channel characteristics are
very volatile and become increasingly difﬁcult to approximate
the further away the transmitter is placed. At around 30
cm distance, capacitive coupling becomes very weak and
unpredictable. We give an example in Figure 12 that shows
if the aluminum sheet is shifted by only 5 cm, the pattern
looks signiﬁcantly different. The bottom red line depicts an
injection attempt where the sheet is placed at a distance of 35
cm instead of 30 cm from the person and the body channel
receiver.
Together with the results from Section VIII-A, these in-
sights let us conclude that our stated read-only assumption for
the body channel holds as long as there is a minimum distance
of 50 cm between adversary’s transmitter and the human body.
IX. RELATED WORK
The idea of applying body channel communication to
device pairing other than for medical sensors or implants has,
to the best of our knowledge, not been documented so far.
The paper that is most related to ours is [27] which proposes a
body area network authentication scheme that does not depend
on prior trust among the nodes. It is based on variations in
received signal strength. Nodes that transmit on an on-body
channel have a distinctive variation behavior of the signal
strength. This behavior is different from a transmission on an
off-body channel. The authors exploit this fact and perform
clustering analysis to differentiate between an attacker and a
