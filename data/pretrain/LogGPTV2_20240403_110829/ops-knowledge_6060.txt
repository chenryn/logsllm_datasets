User: Please explain what is a Docker container and how it differs from a virtual machine.
Assistant: Docker container is a lightweight virtualization technology that uses operating system-level virtualization to isolate applications and their dependencies running on the same physical machine, enabling applications to be deployed and run in different environments. At the same time, it has good isolation and portability. Docker containers are more lightweight than virtual machines because they share the host operating system and kernel, reducing the need for multiple operating systems and kernels. This also eliminates the need for a full OS boot for the Docker container, so it starts faster and consumes less resources. Additionally, containerized applications are easier to deploy, port, and maintain. Virtual machines need to allocate sufficient resources for each instance, resulting in greater resource consumption.
