I've been running test suites with Playwright in our company for almost a
year, and have had no real issues. However, when we tried to onboard one of
our larger components to use it, we sometimes get this error:
    ...

     ...
This happens rarely, about one in every thirty runs, and the test themselves
are completely empty, only doing a call to an endpoint to make sure we can
track the test is run. What might be the cause of this issue? There really
isn't anything to share in terms of code, I scaled down to run basically an
empty project, and the rest is proven to work, having ran thousands and
thousands of suites over a year with no problems. What kind of interaction
might cause these problems so I know where to start to look?
**Expected**
The test runs and passes successfully.
**Actual**
The test runs and passes, but the overall suite fails with the above mentioned
error.
