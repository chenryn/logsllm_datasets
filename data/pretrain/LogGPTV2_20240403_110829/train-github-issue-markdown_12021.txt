React version: 16.12.0
## Steps To Reproduce
A component that suspends as a result of a context update is never rendered to
DOM after suspension is finished.

rklls?file=/package.json:163-170
## The current behavior
If a component suspends as a result of a context update, the component's
render is called after suspension is finished but the result of the render is
not reflected in the DOM (and effects aren't called).
## The expected behavior
If a component suspends as a result of a context update, the component's
render should be called and flushed to the DOM and effects called.
