User: I've noticed that hyperlinks printed in my Debian/Linux terminal are clickable and open the browser when clicked.
I was wondering if this could be used for other things or if this was just hard-coded in the terminal for hyperlinks only.
Is it possible to print out a line in Python that when clicked will launch another process, for example?
Assistant: URL support is hard coded in the individual terminal emulator. 
The terminal may support arbitrary URIs as registered in whichever environment it calls home, so that you can e.g. write a Gnome extension for myapp://something and have it work in gnome-terminal, but this is entirely terminal specific. 
It's also possible for a terminal program in any terminal to receive mouse events and it can then do whatever it wants with them (like how elinks lets you click non-URL links to browse). However, this requires the program to be running in the foreground and controlling everything that appears on that terminal.
