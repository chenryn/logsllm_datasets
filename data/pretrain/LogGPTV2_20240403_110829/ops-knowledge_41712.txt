User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Automatically start Windows Server 2003 Perfmon counter log upon reboot Trying to figure out how to make sure a specific Windows Perfmon Counter Log resumes logging  automatically when the server is rebooted.

This is a Windows 2003 Server, so likely won't have anyone logging on to it immediately upon reboot. I saw this similar question, but didn't think that Scheduled Tasks execute without someone logging on...

Edit: Ok, looks like Scheduled Tasks can be set to run a command each server start, but a couple of remaining questions:


On the "Schedule" tab, should I leave both the "Start log" and "Stop Log" to "manual"? Then use the LOGMAN START command?
I saw some other web references to instead setting the "Stop Log" to 1 day, and checking the "When a log file closes: Start a new log file" checkbox. Any benefits to this approach? Does it recognize and survive a reboot without the explicit LOGMAN START command?
The task scheduler UI, on the Settings tab, has a box marked "Stop the task if it runs for..." that defaults to 72 hours. If I don't remove this check, will it stop my log once the server is up for 72 hrs?


And a final strategy question: If I want to monitor a handful of servers in this manner, for  a short period of time, am I better off setting these monitors up directly on each server, or to run directly on my workstation, gathering data remotely?

Assistant: OK - I remember how to do this now!

Set the START TIME to now (or the past).  Set the STOP AFTER to 9999 days.  This will restart the counter automatically after each reboot without the need for a scheduled start script
