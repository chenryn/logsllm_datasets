Sublime Text offers the following option:

```json
// Set to "none" to turn off drawing white space, "selection" to draw only the
// white space within the selection, and "all" to draw all white space
"draw_white_space": "selection"
```

I would like to see `selection` added to the list of possible values for `editor.renderWhitespace`. I find this feature incredibly useful.

When writing code, I prefer not to show whitespace. However, when I copy and paste code snippets, I like to ensure that the whitespace matches the target document. By simply selecting the text (usually via `Ctrl+A`), I can quickly check the whitespace without having to use arrow keys or toggle a setting.

Thank you.
