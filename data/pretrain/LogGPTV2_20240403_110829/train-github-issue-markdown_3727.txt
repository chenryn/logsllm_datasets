Sublime Text has the option:
        // Set to "none" to turn off drawing white space, "selection" to draw only the
        // white space within the selection, and "all" to draw all white space
        "draw_white_space": "selection",
I would like to see `selection` added to list of possible values for
`editor.renderWhitespace`. I find it incredibly useful.
While writing code, I prefer to not show whitespace. However, when I copy-
paste code snippets, I like to know the whitespace matches the target document
by simply selecting it (usually via `Ctrl+A`), not using the arrow keys or
toggling a setting.
Thanks
