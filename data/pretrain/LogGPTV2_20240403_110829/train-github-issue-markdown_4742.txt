I'm see in docs inside SelectionControls an usage example of Switch with
label, it's supposed to be used like:
     this.setState({ checkedA: checked })}
                />
              }
              label="A"
            />
But my state never changes. To fix it I did:
                        }
                        label="Enable cache?"
                        onClick={() => this.setState({ enableCache: !this.state.enableCache })}
                    />
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
  * When clicking it should change state
## Current Behavior
  * State unchanged
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  * Create a component with just a div
  * Add a initial state for that component with value true or false
  * Inside that div copy+paste this:
     this.setState({ checkedA: checked })}
                />
              }
              label="A"
            />
