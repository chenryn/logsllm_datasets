How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Spam
Who were we?
• Grant Jordan & Kyle Vogt
• MIT students with too much 
free time
• Lots of ridiculous projects
• …like safe cracking.
Who are we NOT?
• Stock Market Experts
• Spammers
• Get Rich Quick Scammers
Spoiler Alert:
• Everything will be seen through a soda straw.
• It’s all from our point of view at the time.
• We couldn’t see the forces behind anything.
• Lots of guesses.  Lots of hypotheticals.
• Moral of the story: 
A lot can be determined without the underlying 
information.  It’s all about how you look at the 
information that everyone already has.
How it all started… 
October 2006
• Kyle: “There must be a way to make money 
off all this spam trying to sell stocks!”
• Grant: “You’re an idiot.”
Why Kyle must have been wrong…
• Profit is derived from asymmetric information.
– “I know something that you don’t!”
• If everyone knows, it’s already priced-in.
• But everyone gets the spam!
• What do we know that others don’t?
But first… 
What is this spam trying to do?

1)  I own 100 shares of Worthless, Inc. @ $1 per share

2)  I go on message boards and tell everyone the stock 
is about to go “THROUGH THE ROOF!!!1”

3)  People go buy the stock

4)  Price goes up with increased demand.           
I sell all my shares @ $2  (Profit!)

5)  Surge of demand was artificial.  
There are no new buyers.      
People try to sell… but can’t!

6)  Stock plummets to below starting price.

My profits
Their losses
Pump & Dump
• “Touting” a stock
• The concept is old
– Word of mouth
– Boiler rooms
– Forums
• Spam!
– Provides a much wider audience at low cost.
Pump & Dump
• Profits determined by when the tout sells out.
• Losses for suckers determined by how late 
they bought in, and when they sell out again.
– Late-comers get crushed!
What kind of stocks are these?
• “Penny Stocks”
• “Over the Counter” (OTC)
– Not traded on a major exchange. 
• (OTC/BB, Pink Sheets)
– Thinly Traded: Near zero volume most days.
– High Volatility: Since price is so low (often $1/share), 
even small changes in price can produce huge % 
change.
• You could spam all you wanted about a NYSE 
stock, but your increased demand would likely 
be nothing against normal trading volume.
IT IS VERY ILLEGAL! 
(and a real dick move)
• All changes in supply and demand of the 
target stock are artificially generated.
Ok, ok, but really… 
Who is dumb enough to buy stock 
because an email told them to?
Result: Plenty of People
• GDKI – Goldmark Industries – 10/20/06
• 60% spike Mon->Fri
• Over 600k shares (possibly >$250k profit!)
Actually… that was small potatoes…
The Bigger Game 
(Two Months Later)
• GDKI – 12/22/06
• 300% increase over 5 days
• Over 10M shares (possibly >$30M profit!)
But wait…
• Not every pick is a winner. (Uh oh.)
• Week 1  - Oct 20-27, 2006
– 20 stocks touted
– 3 produce profits
– GDKI far exceeds others
The Data
• What information do we have?
– Stock spam.  ~1,000 per week.
– Market data showing result of previous week.
What did other researchers see? 
(Hint: Very little)
• Frieder and Zittrain
– “Spam Works: Evidence from Stock Touts and 
Corresponding Market Activity”
• Hanke and Hauser
– “On the Effects of Stock Spam E-mails”
– Both found correlation between volume of stock spam and price 
of touted stocks.
• Numerous researchers claimed that by Fall 2006, stock 
spam was dead.
• How could that be?  We were seeing a ton!
Selection Bias!
• “We first automatically extracted messages that appeared to be 
stock touts. This was done by selecting messages that met two 
conditions: (1) the message contained the word “stock,” and (2) the 
message contained a ticker symbol-like word.”
– Frieder and Zittrain
• “…automatic scripts evaluate the e-mails received for all trap 
accounts, classify the subset of stock spam e-mails according to the 
target stock, and time-stamp them.”
– Hanke and Hauser
• All prominent stock spam studies used text-based analysis.
• Before 2005, that still produced results.  By 2006, nearly 100% of 
the successful stock spam was graphical.
Q: How do you sort graphical spam?
A: By hand!
Sorting Spam
• Sort all stock spam emails by stock symbol.
• 14 weeks
• >50,000 spam emails
• 12,168 stock spam
DATA!
• What can we get out of it?
– Previous results
– Relative botnet power
– Identify spammer’s unique signature
Relative Botnet Power
1. Sort by stock symbol
2. Plot total emails over time for each symbol
GDKI
Spammer Signature
• Each spammer has his/her bag of tricks.
– Layout
– Encoding
– Captcha-type obfuscation
– Style!
• When you’re looking at every email with 
your own eyes, it’s easy…
Game Time!
• Choose the successful spammer…
• Week (n), this email had great results:
Week (n+1) 
Which stock will have similar results?
Hint!
GDKI
SBNS
SRRL
EGLY
CNPM
MPRG

W13
• The text-based spammers lose their minds
– Spamming 15 different stocks
– All text-based
– No results
So what?
• We don’t wait to see how many emails a 
spammer will send out… we already know.
• We pick a winner with a single email.
• When the best spammers sends out his 
first email about a stock, we know to buy.
So we buy the stock… here
The Jordan/Vogt Method
1. Sort week’s worth of spam by ticker symbol.
2. Identify spammer by email style
3. Compare each spammer’s past results
4. Identify top spammer
5. When first email from top spammer 
arrives… buy the stock.
6. Sell out.
Did it work?
• Yes…
• …and no.
• Method worked for a few weeks, until the 
whole bottom fell out of stock spam.
– Best spammer had a bad week (lost ~$2M) 
then dissapeared.
– Major botnet takedowns (?)
– Major SEC crackdown (“Operation Spamalot”)
“Operation Spamalot” – 3/07
• SEC suspended trading on 35 stocks
• Indicted two men in Texas for securities 
fraud.  Eventual $3.8M settlement.
• Operation started because an SEC 
attorney was getting the spam.
Could it work again?
• Maybe.
• Spam goes in cycles… botnets come and go.
A Recent Look at my Spam Folder: 
(April 2009)
• ZERO stock spam emails!
• The whole stock market meltdown thing probably didn’t help.
Drugs
Scam
Watches
Diploma
Sex
Book
Jobs
Gambling
Will it happen again?
• Spammers have given up on stock 
manipulation… for now.
• If it starts again, the Jordan/Vogt method will 
probably work again.
• Unless…
But now you all know…
• So what happens if all of you do it?
– Increased liquidity = More spammer profit
– Stocks tank faster, since you know to get out.
– Maybe the only “suckers” will be the people 
trying to beat the spammers?
• And what if I have a new meta-strategy?
– Because now… “I know you know.”
– Bwahaha! (?)
Questions? 
PI:EMAIL
Other Topics I can discuss:
• Could we possibly crash out the market 
before the spammers sell out?
• Company responses to spam on their stock.
• SEC Investigations of the stocks analyzed.
• Characterizing types of involvement…
– Spammer picking random company
– Inside job
