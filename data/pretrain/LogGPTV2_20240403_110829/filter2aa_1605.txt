### Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Spam

#### Who We Are
- **Grant Jordan & Kyle Vogt**
- MIT students with a lot of free time
- Known for various ridiculous projects, such as safe cracking

#### Who We Are Not
- Stock Market Experts
- Spammers
- Get Rich Quick Scammers

#### Spoiler Alert
- Everything will be seen through a narrow lens.
- It’s all from our point of view at the time.
- We couldn’t see the forces behind anything.
- Lots of guesses and hypotheticals.
- Moral of the story: A lot can be determined without the underlying information. It’s all about how you look at the information that everyone already has.

### How It All Started… 
**October 2006**

- **Kyle**: "There must be a way to make money off all this spam trying to sell stocks!"
- **Grant**: "You’re an idiot."

### Why Kyle Must Have Been Wrong…
- Profit is derived from asymmetric information: "I know something that you don’t!"
- If everyone knows, it’s already priced-in.
- But everyone gets the spam!
- What do we know that others don’t?

### But First… 
What Is This Spam Trying to Do?

#### Anatomy of a “Pump and Dump”
**"Fear and Greed in the 24-hour Economy" – Richard Minsky**

1. **Initial Position**: I own 100 shares of Worthless, Inc. @ $1 per share.
2. **Promotion**: I go on message boards and tell everyone the stock is about to go "THROUGH THE ROOF!!!1"
3. **Buyers Enter**: People go buy the stock.
4. **Price Increase**: Price goes up with increased demand. I sell all my shares @ $2 (Profit!).
5. **Demand Dries Up**: Surge of demand was artificial. There are no new buyers. People try to sell… but can’t!
6. **Stock Plummets**: Stock plummets to below starting price.

**My Profits** | **Their Losses**

### Pump & Dump
- **Touting a Stock**: The concept is old (word of mouth, boiler rooms, forums, spam).
- **Spam**: Provides a much wider audience at low cost.
- **Profits and Losses**: Profits determined by when the tout sells out. Losses for suckers determined by how late they bought in and when they sell out again. Late-comers get crushed!

### What Kind of Stocks Are These?
- **Penny Stocks**: Over the Counter (OTC) stocks not traded on a major exchange.
- **Thinly Traded**: Near-zero volume most days.
- **High Volatility**: Small changes in price can produce huge percentage changes.
- **NYSE Stocks**: You could spam all you wanted about a NYSE stock, but your increased demand would likely be nothing against normal trading volume.

**IT IS VERY ILLEGAL! (and a real dick move)**

- All changes in supply and demand of the target stock are artificially generated.

### Who Is Dumb Enough to Buy Stock Because an Email Told Them To?
- **Result**: Plenty of people.
- **Example**: GDKI – Goldmark Industries – 10/20/06
  - 60% spike Mon->Fri
  - Over 600k shares (possibly >$250k profit!)

### The Bigger Game (Two Months Later)
- **GDKI – 12/22/06**
  - 300% increase over 5 days
  - Over 10M shares (possibly >$30M profit!)

### But Wait…
- **Not every pick is a winner.**
- **Week 1 (Oct 20-27, 2006)**
  - 20 stocks touted
  - 3 produce profits
  - GDKI far exceeds others

### The Data
- **Information We Have**:
  - Stock spam (~1,000 per week).
  - Market data showing results of the previous week.

### What Did Other Researchers See? (Hint: Very Little)
- **Frieder and Zittrain**: Found correlation between volume of stock spam and price of touted stocks.
- **Hanke and Hauser**: Similar findings.
- **Claim**: By Fall 2006, stock spam was dead. But we were seeing a ton!

### Selection Bias!
- **Text-Based Analysis**: Before 2005, text-based analysis still produced results. By 2006, nearly 100% of successful stock spam was graphical.
- **Sorting Graphical Spam**: By hand!

### Sorting Spam
- **Process**:
  - Sort all stock spam emails by stock symbol.
  - 14 weeks
  - >50,000 spam emails
  - 12,168 stock spam

### DATA!
- **What Can We Get Out of It**:
  - Previous results
  - Relative botnet power
  - Identify spammer’s unique signature

### Relative Botnet Power
- **Steps**:
  - Sort by stock symbol
  - Plot total emails over time for each symbol

### Spammer Signature
- **Characteristics**:
  - Layout
  - Encoding
  - Captcha-type obfuscation
  - Style

### Game Time!
- **Choose the Successful Spammer**:
  - Week (n), this email had great results.
  - Week (n+1): Which stock will have similar results?

### Hint!
- **Same Botnet**:
  - GDKI
  - SBNS
  - SRRL
  - EGLY
  - CNPM
  - MPRG
  - APWL
  - WEXE

### Scale Change!
- **Text-Based Spammers**:
  - Spamming 15 different stocks
  - No results

### So What?
- **We Don’t Wait**: We already know which spammers are successful.
- **Pick a Winner**: When the best spammer sends out the first email about a stock, we know to buy.

### The Jordan/Vogt Method
1. **Sort week’s worth of spam by ticker symbol.**
2. **Identify spammer by email style.**
3. **Compare each spammer’s past results.**
4. **Identify top spammer.**
5. **When the first email from the top spammer arrives, buy the stock.**
6. **Sell out.**

### Did It Work?
- **Yes and No**:
  - Method worked for a few weeks.
  - Bottom fell out of stock spam.
  - Best spammer had a bad week (lost ~$2M) then disappeared.
  - Major botnet takedowns.
  - SEC crackdown ("Operation Spamalot").

### Operation Spamalot (March 2007)
- **SEC suspended trading on 35 stocks.**
- **Indicted two men in Texas for securities fraud.**
- **Eventual $3.8M settlement.**
- **Started because an SEC attorney was getting the spam.**

### Could It Work Again?
- **Maybe**:
  - Spam goes in cycles; botnets come and go.
  - **Recent Look (April 2009)**: Zero stock spam emails.
  - **Market Meltdown**: Likely contributed to the decline.

### Will It Happen Again?
- **Spammers have given up on stock manipulation… for now.**
- **If it starts again, the Jordan/Vogt method will probably work again.**
- **Unless…**

### Now You All Know…
- **Increased Liquidity**: More spammer profit.
- **Stocks Tank Faster**: Since you know to get out.
- **Suckers**: Maybe the only “suckers” will be the people trying to beat the spammers.
- **Meta-Strategy**: "I know you know."

### Questions?
- **PI:EMAIL**
- **Other Topics**:
  - Could we possibly crash out the market before the spammers sell out?
  - Company responses to spam on their stock.
  - SEC investigations of the stocks analyzed.
  - Characterizing types of involvement (spammer picking random company, inside job).
