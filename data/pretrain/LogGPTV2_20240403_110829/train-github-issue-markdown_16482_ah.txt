### Output 1.5.1: Building Snapshot Mapping

The `building_snapshot` mapping includes the following aggregation for the Gross Floor Area (GFA):

```json
"aggregations": {
  "gfa": {
    "count": 0,
    "min": null,
    "max": null,
    "avg": null,
    "sum": null
  }
}
```

- **count**: The number of buildings in the snapshot.
- **min**: The minimum GFA value.
- **max**: The maximum GFA value.
- **avg**: The average GFA value.
- **sum**: The total sum of all GFA values.

In this particular output, the aggregation shows that there are no buildings (count: 0), and therefore, the minimum, maximum, average, and sum values are all `null`.
