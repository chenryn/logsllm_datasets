# Bug report
## Describe the bug
We had a working worker file prior to the update to canary, afterwords we get
a 'window is undefined' error and the functionality of our worker is never
fired or fulfilled. We are already on the canary of next-workers which has a
similar bug fix.
## To Reproduce
  1. add next-workers@canary to next.config.js
  2. import a worker file
  3. see that it loads correctly
  4. upgrade to next@canary
  5. visit the page that loads the worker and see window is undefined error.
## Expected behavior
Expect the worker to load correctly
