### Title: Blackhat: EU-19 Blue to Red: Traversing the Spectrum

The growing demand for talent to fill thousands of open roles in the security industry has led to a significant issue: overspecialization. This trend can limit professionals' ability to see the broader picture of the security challenges they face, often hindering progress. It is time to return to the fundamentals. Strong foundational skills in Information Security (InfoSec) and computer science are crucial for effectively addressing diverse security challenges.

In this talk, Amanda will share her non-conventional career journey in security, which includes roles as a forensic technician in government, a malware researcher in the private sector, and an offensive engineer on Facebook's red team. She will highlight how a solid grounding in fundamental security skills has been a consistent and essential thread throughout her various roles.

In an industry that evolves at breakneck speed, it is more important than ever to strike the right balance between leveraging advanced tooling frameworks and relying on core security principles. A deep understanding of basics such as computer architecture, code compilation, data structures, and algorithms is invaluable and remains relevant over time. These skills never expire and provide a strong foundation for navigating the rapidly changing landscape of cybersecurity.

Another critical skill in the security professional's toolkit is an adversarial mindset. The ability to deconstruct problems and devise creative, out-of-the-box solutions is essential for successful hacking. Amanda will discuss how this mindset is not only vital for red teaming but is also indispensable across all security roles. By fostering an adversarial approach, professionals can better anticipate and mitigate potential threats, ensuring a more robust and resilient security posture.
