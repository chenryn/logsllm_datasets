User: My system is composed of a python application that is launched from supervisord. Let's call it A. A launches a subprocess B to do some of its task. Both A and B are coded in Python and use the standard logging module to output messages to the console.
The stdout and stderr of A are logged to a file specified in the supervisord configuration. This works like a charm. Now, I'd like to tunnel the stdout and stderr from B into the same file as in A. How can this be achieved?
Assistant: You don't need to do anything. B inherits A's standard streams by default.
If A's stdout is redirected to a file then B's stdout automatically writes to the same place.
