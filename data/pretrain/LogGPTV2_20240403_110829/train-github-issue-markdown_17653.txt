We've built jaxlib 0.3.7 on conda-forge with cuda: conda-forge/jaxlib-
feedstock#97
I am opening this issue for viz but also for testing/confirmation all is good.
Could someone from the team here have a look with us? Easy things to check, we
get something like ~11000 actions/cycles of bazel compilation (compared to
~7500 for non-cuda) and the size of our artifact is similar to that of the
official jaxlib ~200 mb. I tested it locally and it seems to put the arrays on
the GPU by default. So it is working, but more confirmation is always good!
_Note_ that we build for 10.2, 11.0, 11.1, and 11.2 on conda-forge by default,
though we we can adjust this if requested, and do _note_ the forward
compatibility of 11.2, it is really "11.2+" meaning that it compiles for 11.2
and above (if someone installs that the 11.2 compiled version, it will in fact
install cudatoolkit 11.6 with it and the latest cudnn)
People interested in checking this out, should head to the:
  * PR: link above
  * logs: https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/feedstock-builds/_build/results?buildId=506049
  * artifacts: https://dev.azure.com/conda-forge/feedstock-builds/_build/results?buildId=506049&view=artifacts&pathAsName=false&type=publishedArtifacts
You will see we still have a few problems (lost connections + timeouts mainly)
due to the strict 6-hour time limit (it is tricky because we are very close to
the limit, but hopefully we will manage to get all of them by rerunning the CI
a few times)
Tagging @hawkinsp again who's been involved in issues related to the builds
before + @jakevdp who's been very helpful and engaging.
