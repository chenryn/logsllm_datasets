User: I'm using Eclipse / PyDev and PyUnit on OSX for development. It was recommended to me that I use Nose to execute our suite of tests.
When I configure Nose as the test runner, however, output from the interactive console (either standalone or during debugging) disappears. I can type commands but do not see any output.
Is this normal, or am I missing some configuration?
Assistant: I eventually found in the Preferences > PyDev > PyUnit menu that adding -s to the Parameters for test running stopped this. The parameter prevents the capture of stdout that nose does by default.
The alternate --nocapture parameter should work too.
