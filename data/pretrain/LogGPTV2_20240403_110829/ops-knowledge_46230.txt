User: Easy quesiton here.  I have a GUI which I run using a batch file. I want it to be displayed with out the terminal in the background, so I use the pythonw executable.  However, I am not using the corresponding .pyw file, but a regular .py file instead.  
Are there any differences between python and pythonw that might cause strange behavior.  The program gives strange behavior when I use the batch file, but not when within cmd so I suspect the culprit is some internal difference between python and pythonw.  Could this be the case? Thanks in advance.
Assistant: The only problems I would expect would be in:

print
stdin
stdout 
raw_input
