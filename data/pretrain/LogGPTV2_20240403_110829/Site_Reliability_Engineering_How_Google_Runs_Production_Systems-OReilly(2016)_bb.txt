### Data Integrity and Availability in Cloud Applications

#### Metadata Management and Caching
- **Metadata Storage**: An application may store small amounts of authoritative metadata related to its blobs in a high-latency, less available, and more expensive Paxos-based service like Megastore [Bak11], [Lam98].
- **Client-Side Caching**: Some clients may cache this metadata locally, allowing direct access to the blobs, which further reduces latency from the user's perspective.
- **Alternative Metadata Storage**: Another application might store metadata in Bigtable, sacrificing strong distributed consistency due to the developers' familiarity with Bigtable.

#### Data Integrity Challenges
- **Referential Integrity**: Cloud applications face data integrity challenges, such as maintaining referential integrity between different datastores (e.g., Blobstore, Megastore, and client-side caches).
- **Schema Changes and Migrations**: High-velocity changes, including schema modifications, data migrations, and the addition of new features, can create complex relationships between data that no single engineer fully understands.
- **Data Consistency Checks**: To prevent data degradation, a system of out-of-band checks and balances is needed within and between datastores. This is discussed in "Third Layer: Early Detection" on page 356.

#### Backup and Recovery
- **Backup Strategies**: If an application relies on independent, uncoordinated backups of multiple datastores (e.g., Blobstore and Megastore), the recovery process becomes complicated by the various relationships between restored and live data.
- **Recovery Scenarios**: The application must distinguish between restored blobs versus live Megastore, restored Megastore versus live blobs, and interactions with client-side caches.

#### Backups Versus Archives
- **Purpose of Backups**: The primary goal of backups is data recovery, not just data protection. Backups should be designed for quick restoration during a disaster.
- **Archives vs. Backups**: Archives are used for long-term data retention to meet auditing, discovery, and compliance needs. Backups, on the other hand, can be loaded back into an application and are essential for disaster recovery.
- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**: When formulating a backup strategy, consider how quickly you need to recover from a problem and how much recent data you can afford to lose.

#### Cloud Environment Challenges
- **Mixed Solutions**: Using a combination of transactional and nontransactional backup and restore solutions can lead to recovered data that is not correct.
- **Service Evolution**: Services must evolve without downtime, leading to different versions of business logic acting on data in parallel.
- **Independent Versioning**: Independently versioned services can interact momentarily, increasing the risk of data corruption or loss.

#### API Considerations
- **API Simplicity**: Service providers must offer simple and easy-to-use APIs to attract a wide range of customers.
- **API Robustness**: These APIs must also handle data locality, caching, local and global data distribution, strong and eventual consistency, and data durability, backup, and recovery.

#### SRE Objectives in Maintaining Data Integrity and Availability
- **Concrete Objectives**: SREs define key metrics to set expectations for system capabilities and track performance during events.
- **Data Availability**: While data integrity is crucial, data availability is the ultimate goal. Users need to know that their information will be correct and accessible when needed.

#### Effective Restore Plans
- **Failure Modes**: There are 24 distinct types of failures that can occur in any combination. An effective restore plan must account for all these failure modes.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: A robust backup and recovery solution should provide point-in-time recovery across ACID and BASE datastores while meeting strict uptime, latency, scalability, velocity, and cost goals.

#### Challenges of Maintaining Data Integrity
- **Replication and Redundancy**: Replication provides benefits but cannot protect against all sources of data loss. Diverse storage solutions are key.
- **Scalability Issues**: Balancing full and incremental backups, and managing the competing forces of data freshness and restore completion, is challenging.
- **Retention Policies**: How long you keep copies of your data around is another critical factor in data recovery plans.

#### Google SRE Practices
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of defense, including soft deletion, backups, and regular data validation, are employed to ensure data integrity.
- **Soft Deletion**: Soft deletion marks data as deleted but retains it for a reasonable delay, providing a buffer against accidental deletions.
- **Backups and Recovery**: The focus is on recovery, not just backups. Factors such as backup frequency, storage location, and retention period are driven by recovery needs.

#### Early Detection
- **Data Propagation**: "Bad" data propagates, making early detection crucial. The sooner data issues are identified, the easier and more complete the recovery can be.
- **Data Quality Degradation**: In high-velocity environments, data quality can degrade over time without conscious efforts to track emerging relationships in the data.

By addressing these challenges and implementing robust strategies, cloud applications can maintain both data integrity and availability, ensuring a reliable and trustworthy service for users.
