Numpy.power(a,b) doesn't seem to be handling large numbers properly.

Maybe a bug in multiplying matrixes?

Numpy info: numpy in
/Users/usernameHere/miniconda3/envs/nnseries/lib/python3.6/site-packages
(1.12.1)  
Update:  
This seems similar to my c++ program that couldn't handle numbers larger than
2^31. If numpy uses a c or c++, an arbitrary-length integer library may be
need to handle large numbers.
