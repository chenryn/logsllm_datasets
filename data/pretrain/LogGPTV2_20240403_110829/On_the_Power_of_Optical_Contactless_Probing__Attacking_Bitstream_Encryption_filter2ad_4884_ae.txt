of time to explore and probe the device without worrying about
damage.
7 POTENTIAL COUNTERMEASURES
There are three requirements for performing extraction of bitstream
data as described in this work. The first is optical access to the
transistors of the device. The second is the discoverability of the
plaintext transistors through EOFM. The third is the availability of
a trigger signal for the final EOP acquisition. All requirements can
be targeted to hinder attacks.
7.1 Optical Access
There are two ways to protect against optical access, the first is
detection and the second is prevention.
Silicon light sensors are conventional solutions, which have been
proposed to detect the photons of the light beam. However, if the
incident light has a longer wavelength than the silicon band gap, as
in our experiments, the light sensors are only stimulated thermally.
In this case, no electron-hole pairs are generated, and hence, a
silicon photo sensor is not triggered. Thus, silicon light sensors
can not be used to detect optical probing attacks with 1.3 µm light
sources.
However, there is thermal stimulation during EOP/EOFM attempts,
which can lead to immediate local disturbances in temperature and
current of the transistors on the chip. This is often also referred to
as Thermal Laser Stimulation (TLS) in the literature. Temperature
and current variations influence the signal propagation delays of
timing-dependent circuits, such as ring-oscillator Physically Un-
clonable Functions (PUFs). As proposed in [22], one potential coun-
termeasure could be utilizing a ring-oscillator PUF and distributing
its ring-oscillators close to the decryption core and the bus to de-
tect optical probing attempts. In this case, any EOFM/EOP attempt
would affect the behavior of the PUF with a high probability. The
experimental results in [22] demonstrated that the attack can con-
sequently be detected. As an anti-tamper reaction, the BBRAM key
storage could be zeroized, or the whole decryption core could be
locked down. Alternatively, less extreme countermeasure could be
employed, like generating gibberish bitstream data, while optical
probing is detected and returning to normal operation afterward.
Since PUFs have been already considered for secret key generation
inside FPGAs [17], it is conceivable to use the same PUFs as sensors
to detect optical probing attacks as well. An additional advantage
of this protection scheme is that it can also be employed by FPGA
users on the reconfigurable logic without the need for hardware
modifications.
A more complete approach would be to fundamentally prevent
optical access to the chip. For the silicon frontside this is already a
Session H1:  Crypto AttacksCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA1672given because of the numerous metal layers of modern technologies.
High-security ICs even implement active shield structures on the
frontmost metal layers for protection. However, the silicon backside
is currently lacking such protection, and worse, modern flip-chip
packages even facilitate access.
Similar to power side-channel analysis countermeasures, adding
gates carrying an inverted signal for cancellation of the EOP signal
is also imaginable. Yet, this would require development and verifi-
cation of suitable structures and ASIC design tools and is therefore
not an out-of-the-box solution.
An apparent solution would be to employ the same laser engraving
process that is used for the device markings to decrease the sub-
strate’s optical quality on top of the AES core. However, although
the signal quality and resolution are reduced, we could acquire
EOFM signals from structures directly under device markings dur-
ing our experiments. Additionally, the presence of this passive
structure can not be monitored, and therefore, it could be removed
by simple polishing. Nevertheless, such an approach would increase
the effort needed for an attack and the probability of device damage
and key loss.
A better approach would be to add an entirely opaque layer to
the backside of the chip. Passive physical protections, such as heat
spreader lids, can already make physical access to the substrate
more challenging. However, they are not designed with protection
in mind, and thus, can also be removed without consequences [11].
Hence, a proper protection layer would need to be actively moni-
tored. Such a scheme could make use of interactions between the
protection structure and transistors on the chip to detect removal.
To achieve this, first experimental results of a concept which uses
special layers coated on the silicon substrate were presented in [2, 3].
In this case, the p-n junctions of standard transistors were operated
in a way which causes them to emit photons. These photons then
travel inside the silicon substrate to the backside, where a multilayer
coating reflects them. This reflected light then travels back to other
transistors on the chip, which are configured as light detectors. If
an attacker removes the coating layers from the silicon substrate,
the reflection characteristics of the backside are changed, and thus,
attack attempts can be detected. As the layer is engineered to have
non-standard angular-dependent reflection characteristics, simply
coating the device with a new layer will not allow normal oper-
ation. Additionally, since standard transistors already present in
the device are used as emitters and detectors, the overhead for the
protection circuit is minimized. If such a scheme was implemented
by FPGA vendors, it could effectively hinder all backside attacks
including optical probing.
Therefore, there are experimentally validated concepts available
to either detect [22] or completely prevent [2, 3] optical probing
access. If further research is able to validate their mass production
compatibility, they could protect future generations of ICs against
optical backside attacks.
7.2 EOFM Discoverability
To increase the effort for the identification of the plaintext tran-
sistors through EOFM, designers of ASIC decryption cores could
distribute and obfuscate the gates carrying the plaintext signal.
However, it should be kept in mind, that this might add timing
issues and overhead to the circuit.
7.3 EOP Trigger
As the attacker needs a suitable trigger for EOP waveform acquisi-
tion, restricting access to the configuration clock signal CCLK is a
potential countermeasure. An easy way for FPGA users to hinder
an attacker could be the use of BGA packages for both FPGA and
NVM and routing of CCLK and other relevant signals through the
internal layers of the PCB. An attacker would then have to gain
access through milling or drilling the PCB which increases the
probability of damage or key loss. In this context, it might also
be advantageous to use the key storage power supply as an addi-
tional makeshift protection structure. If the corresponding trace is
routed on internal PCB layers above and below the CCLK signal
this further increases the chance of key loss when milling.
It should be noted that this approach is only beneficial if an unstable
clock source is used (see Sect. 6.2). Otherwise, the attacker can
simply synchronize her equipment to a reset or power-on signal
if these are freely available. An FPGA user still could circumvent
this by unlinking power-on/reset and configuration start. This is
achievable by using a two-stage configuration process in FPGAs
which have dynamic or partial reconfiguration capability. If the first
stage adds a random delay, it destroys the fixed relation between
power-on/reset and configuration start.
A more thorough solution could come from the FPGA vendor side
in the form of a circuit that destroys the fixed relationship between
internal AES and external clock/data signals. Examples of circuits
are small random delay FIFO buffers, the addition of jitter to the
external signals or even a completely asynchronous internal clock.
It should, however, be kept in mind that such a design might be
challenging and also results in lower configuration speeds because
of the added delays. Yet, if because of such an approach there is no
direct or indirect external trigger available for the EOP acquisition,
bitstream extraction can not take place.
8 CONCLUSION
In this work, we assessed the threat of conducting an optical prob-
ing attack against a commercial device with little or no knowledge
about the security circuits available to the adversary. To this end,
we mounted an attack against the bitstream encryption feature
of a modern FPGA. While we had no prior knowledge about the
underlying decryption cores, we demonstrated that renting the
necessary equipment from a failure analysis lab for less than 10
days is enough for an attacker to localize the security circuits and
extract plaintext data from the chip. Since modern silicon dies come
in flip-chip packages, no chip preparation and silicon thinning were
required for optical contactless probing in contrast to previous at-
tacks. We also demonstrated that 1 µm optical resolution is enough
to successfully attack a 28 nm technology device. The foremost
Session H1:  Crypto AttacksCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA1673reason that modern chips are vulnerable to optical probing is the
lack of an effective protection of their backside. Hence, we provided
a set of countermeasures, which can be integrated into modern
ICs in different phases of manufacturing and application design, to
protect them from this class of attack.
