Abstract—Many wireless communications systems found in
aircraft lack standard security mechanisms, leaving them vulner-
able to attack. With affordable software-deﬁned radios readily
available, a novel threat has emerged which allows a wide range of
attackers to easily interfere with wireless avionic systems. Whilst
these vulnerabilities are known, predicting their ultimate effect is
difﬁcult. A major factor in this effect is how ﬂight crew respond,
especially whether their extensive training in fault handling helps
them to manage attacks.
To investigate this we conducted a user study, inviting 30
Airbus A320 type-rated pilots to ﬂy simulator scenarios in
which they were subjected to attacks on their avionics. We use
wireless attacks on three safety-related systems, based on existing
literature: Trafﬁc Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Ground
Proximity Warning System (GPWS) and the Instrument Landing
System (ILS). To analyze their response, we collected control
input data coupled with closed and open interview responses.
We found that all three attack scenarios created signiﬁcant
control impact and disruption through missed approaches, avoid-
ance maneuvers and diversions. They further increased workload,
distrust in the affected system, and for each attack, at least a third
of our participants switched off the system entirely—even if they
were important safety systems. All pilots felt the scenarios were
useful, with 93.3% feeling that simulator training for wireless
attacks could be valuable.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past few decades, ﬂying has become ever safer
culminating in the year 2017, where not a single death was
recorded for commercial passenger air travel [3]. As a whole,
the aviation industry and regulators have achieved this with
a meticulous focus on safety; for example having stringent
requirements on the testing, maintenance and certiﬁcation of
an aircraft.
Two key components of this all-permeating safety mindset
are pilot training and on board safety systems. Regular training
and assessment of pilots using ﬂight simulator scenarios helps
to prepare them in the safe handling of many ﬂight situations.
On the other hand, the many wireless technologies onboard an
aircraft help to increase situational awareness for pilots and air
trafﬁc control (ATC) alike.

If these avionic systems malfunction or are not used as
intended, the consequences can be serious. One example is the
case of an inoperative transponder onboard a Delta Airlines
aircraft in March 2011, which remained undetected for ten
minutes [14]. During this time it ﬂew in close proximity
to three aircraft—a working transponder would have helped
avoid these unsafe situations. In extreme cases, equipment
malfunction can cause loss of life. In 2006,
two aircraft
collided in Brazil partly due to a failing transponder not
relaying collision avoidance messages [1].
Similar to many industries with safety-critical components,
aviation is currently working on securing its infrastructure
against the new threat of cyber attacks. In this process, all
wireless technologies have come under scrutiny, as they almost
in their entirety lack fundamental security mechanisms [49].
A subset has been shown to be exploitable under laboratory
conditions using widely accessible software-deﬁned radios
(SDRs) and software tools (e.g. [10], [43], [46]).
Since the publication of these proof-of-concept demonstra-
tions, the aviation sector has been discussing the severity and
reality of this threat, particularly to safety systems. Recent
research from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
indicating remote compromise of a Boeing 757 aircraft was
dismissed by the manufacturer, who claimed conﬁdence in the
security of its aircraft [11]. Several surveys on the perspec-
tives of pilots and other aviation professionals indicate split
opinions. Some believe attackers could succeed in creating
‘unsafe ﬂight conditions’—the prominent view, however, is
that such attacks are mitigated already through aviation’s
extensive safety systems and culture [2], [48].
Unfortunately, security research into avionics, such as
in [10], [43], [46] and [47], has shown that the threat is
not addressed by safety-oriented design. Instead, this kind of
design deals with random mechanical, electronic, or human
failure, rather than deliberate and targeted attempts to subvert
the system. As such, an important question is whether attackers
can induce failures or unintended behavior using wireless
attacks, which then go on to negatively impact the safety of
an aircraft.
A standard security assessment approach to this faces a
number of challenges. Flight hardware is extremely expensive
and difﬁcult
to use in isolation, making the construction
of a real-world testbed prohibitive for independent research.
Furthermore, the ﬂight crew have ultimate authority over how
an aircraft is ﬂown, so their response to attacks can do anything
from amplifying the effects to mitigating them entirely. Hence,
understanding ow pilots in the loop manage attacks is a
necessary requirement to gauge the true impact of wireless
attacks, especially on disruption and safety of the aircraft.
the potential security solutions available [47]. More recently,
some other systems such as those used to assist landing were
shown to be vulnerable to SDR-based attacks [40]; we discuss
this work in more detail in Sec. IV.
To better assess this impact we conducted a user study,
simulating three wireless interference attacks in a cockpit envi-
ronment. Our work recruits 30 professional airline pilots to ﬂy
scenarios in a ﬂight simulator during which they are subject to
realistic cyber attacks. Some of our attacks are based on related
work, whilst others are novel and based on analysis of the-
oretical vulnerabilities and real-world interference incidents.
We consider three heavily used safety-related systems: the
Instrument Landing System (ILS), Trafﬁc Collision Avoidance
System (TCAS) and the Ground Proximity Warning System
(GPWS).
Contributions: This paper identiﬁes how pilots respond
to remote wireless attacks on avionics with the intention of
highlighting systems requiring further attention. Our contribu-
tions are as follows:
• We implement realistic wireless attacks on avionics in
a ﬂight simulator for three systems: collision avoid-
ance, instrument landing and ground proximity.
• We run experiments with 30 Airbus A320 pilots to
understand how ﬂight crew respond to these attacks.
• We analyze in-simulator and interview debrief results
from the experiments, quantifying attack impact on
the aircraft as well as lessons learned from the study.
We begin with background in Sec. II, before outlining our
threat model in Sec. III. We discuss systems and attacks in
Sec. IV, then cover our experimental method in Sec. V. Our
results are presented in Sec. VI, followed by discussion in
Sec. VII. We discuss lessons learned in Sec. VIII and conclude
in Sec. IX.
Awareness about cyber attacks varies, as demonstrated
in [49]. The authors survey aviation professionals on their
perceptions on the security of a range of different avionic
systems. Whilst there is awareness that the systems are not
inherently secure,
there does not appear to be signiﬁcant
concern that attacks could affect operational capability.
B. Simulator Training
Time spent in the simulator is a vital part of professional
pilot training. A body of research analyzes the conﬁguration
of simulator scenarios such that they transfer most easily to
ﬂying the real aircraft. Early research indicated that it provides
notable beneﬁt over aircraft-only training [24]. However, it is
not a given that high-ﬁdelity simulations transfer skills well,
and the literature suggests that well-designed scenarios are
vital in equipping pilots effectively [39], [12].
One of the key factors in cyber attacks is that there may
be no forewarning, leading to surprise and loss of capacity.
In [29], a survey of aviation incident reports highlights that
‘normal’ events can be surprising to pilots when they occur
out of context, i.e. alerts when the conditions do not warrant it.
The authors in [32] and [7] consider this with respect to stall
recovery maneuvers, a regularly tested skill for pilots. Both
papers ﬁnd that pilots struggled to follow even well-known
procedures when the stall occurred in unexpected conditions.
the authors of [33] argue that unpre-
dictability and variability in simulator training improves per-
formance when encountering surprise scenarios. While their
work uses failure scenarios instead of malicious interference,
the arguments remain valid.
Addressing this,
II. BACKGROUND
C. Simulating Cyber Attacks
Whilst cyber security in aviation is a more recent concern,
investigation into the effectiveness of ﬂight simulators for
training is more developed. In this section we consider the
background for both of these areas.
A. Cyber Security in Aviation
Increasing awareness of cyber threats in aviation has
spurred early-stage research into attacks and countermeasures.
An early analysis into the vulnerability of the Automatic
Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) surveillance sys-
tem generated more widespread attention [10]. At the threat
modelling level, several works assess feasible types of attack.
In [28], the highlighted threats are spooﬁng, exploiting, denial
of service and counterfeiting. Our study focuses on spooﬁng
and denial of service attacks. In [37], speciﬁc threats to avia-
tion security are enumerated, including possible consequences
of attacks on collision avoidance systems. We directly assess
some of these effects.
Furthermore, technical research into the security of sec-
ondary surveillance radar (SSR) systems has assessed the
constraints on an attacker aiming to inject, modify or delete
SSR messages [43], and provided a thorough assessment of
Some work addressing simulation for cyber security has
begun to emerge. In [23] the authors conduct a human factors
focused study to assess how pilots respond to an attack on
ground-based navigation systems. They ﬁnd that pilots under
attack lose some monitoring capacity, and that warnings can
help mitigate this. The authors of [6] (and the extended [15])
conduct a more avionics-focused set of attacks, looking at six
variants of navigation and ﬂight management system threats.
Multiple attacks inserted over the course of one ﬂight with
the intention being to assess if pilots notice the attacks. They
found that most attacks were identiﬁed during ﬂight, however
some happened without detection.
Our work differs in that we focus speciﬁcally on systems
that are either entirely or partly safety-critical with the attacker
instead aiming to cause disruption as a minimum. We also
chose to explore a different set of systems and cover the
principles of these attacks in technical detail.
III. THREAT MODEL
We presume a moderately resourced attacker, able to buy
commercially off-the-shelf antennae, ampliﬁers, and SDRs.
A high-end set up could cost under $15,000,
including a
2
scientiﬁc-level SDR (e.g. the Ettus USRP at around $6000),
high-power ampliﬁers for VHF and UHF (likely to be bespoke
or scientiﬁc hardware but approximately $7000 in total) and
directional VHF and UHF antennas, one for each attack (ap-
proximately $500-$1000 depending on the number required).
For lesser-equipped attackers, a more basic set up could be
achieved for under $3000 by using an SDR such as the HackRF
($300), a commodity ampliﬁer ($1000) and omnidirectional
antenna (around $200 for both). This approach does have
limitations though; it would not have sufﬁcient power to carry
out attacks over long distances, so would be less effective.
We presume that the attackers in this paper have a high-end
set up. This would enable them to transmit at sufﬁcient power
to communicate with airborne aircraft. We also presume they
have the capability to develop software, or use existing open-
source tools, to interfere with aircraft systems. Our attacker
can deploy their systems remotely or create a mobile platform
from which to do this.
Threat Actors: We consider three threat actors: ac-
tivists, terrorists and nation states. Activists intend to cause
disruption to raise the proﬁle of their cause, usually with
low resource but high levels of personnel. On the other hand,
terrorists aim to disrupt or destroy with the intent of creating a
chilling effect or fear. They can be moderately resourced and
are unlikely to care about collateral damage. Most extreme is
the nation state who primarily intend to disrupt in order to
paralyze infrastructure. They are well resourced and are likely
to be concerned about attribution and collateral.
Attack Aims: We focus on attempts to cause disruption,
rather than destructive impact. This is due to our work looking
to the fundamentals of the attacks, in which disruption is
likely to be the ﬁrst effect, though these may have destructive
variants. This can include diversions to alternative airports,
excessive movement away from planned routes or go-arounds,
i.e. a missed approach to land followed by a second attempt.
Our work intends to identify how crew handle these attacks as
a base case, which is indicative of the impact they would have
under a stronger threat model. As such, we believe that based
on our results, future work could focus on destructive attacks.
We discuss this further in Sec. VII.
Furthermore, we are careful to ensure the experiment is
fair. In scenarios where the aircraft is put at risk of crashing
it would be unrealistic to assess pilot response outside of their
normal environment. For example, we could not accurately
assess response times if controls are slightly different to a full
simulator or real aircraft. We cover our experimental setup and
its limitations in Sec. V.
IV. SYSTEMS AND ATTACKS
We now concisely describe the systems and the attacks
used in the experiment, including the expected crew responses.
More detailed technical descriptions of the attacks can be
found in App. A.
A. Ground Proximity Warning System
A fundamental part of an aircraft’s ‘safety net’, the Ground
Proximity Warning System (GPWS) provides early warning of
the aircraft becoming too close to terrain [5].
Fig. 1: Normal system operation with radio altimeter deter-
mining height above ground.
1) System Description: Two versions of this system exist—
the original GPWS, and the newer Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS)
which incorporates GPS and a terrain database. The subsystem
used in this study is the same in both. Taking a range of sensor
inputs, GPWS provides alarms of situations leading to collision
with terrain [51]. It has a range of alert modes; we focus on
excessive closure on terrain, or Mode 2 [5]. Mode 2 GPWS
uses a radio altimeter to determine of the height above ground
level (AGL) and the rate of closure on nearby terrain; one
of the primary uses is on approach to landing. We provide a
representation of this on approach in Fig. 1.
2) Attack Description: Our attacker creates a spurious
ground proximity alert when the aircraft is close to landing (i.e.
on ﬁnal approach) to negatively impact situational awareness
and cause an unwarranted go-around. As a result, aircraft
will then have to perform a second approach or divert to a
different airport. During this time, the aircraft will be using
extra fuel, incurring delay and increasing workload for the
pilots. By transmitting speciﬁcally-crafted false radar pulses
on ﬁnal approach, the attacker causes GPWS to believe that
the terrain closure rate is signiﬁcantly higher than in reality.
This will trigger a ‘Terrain Terrain, Pull Up’ alarm, even
though the aircraft is close to the ground yet within a ‘safe’
range. In terms of resource, the timing of this attack is likely
to present the greatest challenge and will need appropriate
software developed. Hardware requirements are simpler, as it
requires the directional transmission of a pulse on a given
frequency; this aspect is similar to a DEF CON 2019 talk
which attacked police speed radars [50]. As such, this attack
can be carried out by lower capability and resourced threats.
3) Expected Response: Whilst the response will depend on
the aircraft and airline, there are common principles [45]. In
most conditions we expect a terrain avoidance maneuver on
alarm, i.e. a steep climb to a safe altitude. In our scenario, this
will lead to a missed approach. However, below 1000 ft above
aerodrome level (AAL), with full certainty of position, crew
can choose to not follow this. Due to the surprise element,
we expect the typical response to be a missed approach. On
following approaches we expect participants to have identiﬁed
unexpected behavior and disregard the warnings.
4) Simulator Implementation: We simulate the attack by
triggering the GPWS ‘Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up’ alarm starting
at 500 ft AGL on approach to Runway 33 at Birmingham,
increasing by 250 ft for each subsequent attack. This emulates
the ability of an attacker to add some unpredictability to the
attack. One of the limitations of this approach is that the point
at which the attack actually triggers can vary between 450 ft
and 500 ft AGL, and the radio altimeter display does not show

other aircraft. This may result in diversions or switching TCAS
off. To achieve this, the attacker generates TCAS responses for
a false intruder aircraft, which approaches the object aircraft
until it reaches the alert regions. We refer to the attacked
aircraft as target and the injected aircraft as false. Some of the
technical capabilities required for such an attack can be seen
in [4], wherein the author explores how to trick a target aircraft
to track an attacker-generated aircraft. This is a powerful attack
requiring expensive equipment and the ability to cover a large
geographic area; the threat actor most likely to be capable of
this is a nation state. However, an attack covering a smaller
region could be carried out by a less well-equipped attacker,
e.g. a terrorist group.
3) Expected Response: As following an RA is compulsory,
we expect pilots will comply with at least the ﬁrst instance,
follow the instructed maneuver [44]. From there, we expect
some participants to doubt RAs and eventually turn the alert
level down from TA/RA to TA-Only or Standby. On average,
we expect participants to follow 3-4 RAs before reducing the
alert level or switching the system off.
4) Simulator Implementation: Within the simulator, we
enact a strong attacker who covers a large geographic area,
attempting to trigger 10 alerts over the course of the ﬂight.
We varied the angle and speed of approach by the false
aircraft. Each participant had the same sequence of false
aircraft approaching in the same way. False aircraft began
to be injected when the target aircraft ﬂew above 2000 ft,
after which the ﬁrst injection began. If the participant chose
to turn the TCAS sensitivity to TA-Only, they would still
receive TAs but not RAs. This attack was undertaken by using
an invisible aircraft model which travelled towards the target
aircraft. Further work would improve the realism of this, such
as more realistic ﬂight patterns to avoid tipping off participants
to the attack.
C. Instrument Landing System
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) allows precision
landings even in poor weather conditions. Since aircraft must
follow speciﬁc arrival routes into an airport, ILS is an im-
portant part of managing pilot workload and is the default
approach type for most airports. In extreme cases, ILS allows
aircraft to automatically land at sufﬁciently equipped airﬁelds.
1) System Description: ILS consists of two components:
localizer (LOC) and glideslope (GS) [21]. A localizer provides
lateral guidance and alignment, centered on the runway center-
line, whereas the GS provides vertical guidance to a touchdown
zone on the runway. Typically,
the GS will provide a 3°
approach path, though this depends on the speciﬁc approach
and airport [41]. It is supplemented by Distance Measuring
Equipment (DME), which provides the direct distance to a
beacon without directionality.
Transmission powers of the GS and LOC are 5 W and
100 W respectively [21]. On the carrier frequencies for the
GS and LOC, overlapping 90 Hz and 150 Hz lobes provide
guidance with the overlap forming the centerline on the
