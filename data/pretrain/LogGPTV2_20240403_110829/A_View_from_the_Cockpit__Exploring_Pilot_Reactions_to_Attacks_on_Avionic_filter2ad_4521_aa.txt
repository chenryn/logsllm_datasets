## Abstract

Many wireless communication systems in aircraft lack standard security mechanisms, making them vulnerable to attacks. With the availability of affordable software-defined radios (SDRs), a new threat has emerged, allowing a wide range of attackers to easily interfere with avionics. While these vulnerabilities are known, predicting their impact is challenging. A key factor is how flight crews respond, particularly whether their extensive training in fault handling helps them manage such attacks.

To investigate this, we conducted a user study involving 30 Airbus A320 type-rated pilots who flew simulator scenarios under attack conditions. We used wireless attacks on three safety-related systems: Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), and Instrument Landing System (ILS). We analyzed their responses through control input data and both closed and open interview responses.

Our findings indicate that all three attack scenarios caused significant control impact and disruption, including missed approaches, avoidance maneuvers, and diversions. The attacks also increased workload and distrust in the affected systems, with at least a third of participants switching off the systems, even if they were critical for safety. All pilots found the scenarios useful, with 93.3% agreeing that simulator training for wireless attacks could be valuable.

## 1. Introduction

Over the past few decades, commercial air travel has become increasingly safe, with no fatalities recorded in 2017 [3]. This safety record is due to the aviation industry's and regulators' meticulous focus on safety, including stringent testing, maintenance, and certification requirements for aircraft.

Two key components of this safety mindset are pilot training and onboard safety systems. Regular training and assessment using flight simulators prepare pilots to handle various flight situations safely. Onboard wireless technologies enhance situational awareness for both pilots and air traffic control (ATC).

However, if these avionic systems malfunction or are misused, the consequences can be severe. For example, in March 2011, a Delta Airlines aircraft experienced an inoperative transponder, which went undetected for ten minutes, leading to close proximity with three other aircraft [14]. In 2006, a collision in Brazil was partly attributed to a failing transponder not relaying collision avoidance messages [1].

The aviation industry is now working to secure its infrastructure against cyber threats. Many wireless technologies lack fundamental security mechanisms, making them exploitable under laboratory conditions using SDRs and software tools [49]. Recent research, such as that from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, has highlighted the potential for remote compromise of aircraft [11]. However, opinions among aviation professionals are divided, with some believing that existing safety systems and culture can mitigate such attacks [2, 48].

Security research into avionics has shown that safety-oriented design does not address deliberate and targeted attempts to subvert the system. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how pilots respond to wireless attacks, as their actions can either amplify or mitigate the effects.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Cyber Security in Aviation

Increasing awareness of cyber threats in aviation has led to early-stage research into attacks and countermeasures. Early analysis of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system generated widespread attention [10]. Threat models have identified spooﬁng, exploitation, denial of service, and counterfeiting as feasible types of attacks [28]. Our study focuses on spooﬁng and denial of service attacks.

Technical research into the security of secondary surveillance radar (SSR) systems has assessed the constraints on attackers aiming to inject, modify, or delete SSR messages [43]. Some work has begun to simulate cyber security scenarios, assessing how pilots respond to attacks on ground-based navigation systems [23] and multiple variants of navigation and flight management system threats [6, 15].

### 2.2 Simulator Training

Simulator training is a vital part of professional pilot training. Research has shown that well-designed simulator scenarios effectively transfer skills to real-world flying [24, 39, 12]. One key factor in cyber attacks is the element of surprise, which can lead to loss of capacity. Studies have found that pilots struggle to follow even well-known procedures when faced with unexpected conditions [29, 32, 7]. Unpredictability and variability in simulator training can improve performance in surprise scenarios [33].

## 3. Threat Model

We assume a moderately resourced attacker capable of purchasing commercially available equipment such as antennae, amplifiers, and SDRs. A high-end setup could cost under $15,000, including a scientific-level SDR (e.g., Ettus USRP at around $6,000), high-power amplifiers, and directional antennas. A more basic setup could be achieved for under $3,000 with a HackRF SDR, commodity amplifier, and omnidirectional antenna. The high-end setup would enable attacks over longer distances, while the basic setup would be less effective.

We consider three threat actors: activists, terrorists, and nation-states. Activists aim to cause disruption to raise awareness, often with low resources but high personnel. Terrorists aim to disrupt or destroy, with moderate resources and little concern for collateral damage. Nation-states aim to paralyze infrastructure, with high resources and concerns about attribution and collateral damage.

Our focus is on causing disruption rather than destructive impact. This includes diversions to alternative airports, excessive movement away from planned routes, or go-arounds. We ensure the experiment is fair by avoiding scenarios where the aircraft is at risk of crashing, as this would not accurately assess pilot response.

## 4. Systems and Attacks

### 4.1 Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS)

#### 4.1.1 System Description
GPWS provides early warnings of terrain proximity [5]. It has two versions: the original GPWS and the Enhanced GPWS (EGPWS), which incorporates GPS and a terrain database. Both use a radio altimeter to determine height above ground level (AGL) and closure rate. We focus on Mode 2, which triggers a "Terrain Terrain, Pull Up" alarm.

#### 4.1.2 Attack Description
Our attacker creates a false GPWS alert during final approach, causing an unwarranted go-around. By transmitting false radar pulses, the attacker makes GPWS believe the terrain closure rate is higher than reality, triggering the alarm. This attack can be carried out by lower-capability threats.

#### 4.1.3 Expected Response
Pilots are expected to perform a terrain avoidance maneuver, typically a steep climb to a safe altitude, leading to a missed approach. Below 1,000 ft AAL, with full certainty of position, crew may choose not to follow the alarm. Subsequent approaches may see pilots disregarding the warnings.

#### 4.1.4 Simulator Implementation
We simulate the attack by triggering the "Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up" alarm starting at 500 ft AGL on approach to Runway 33 at Birmingham, increasing by 250 ft for each subsequent attack.

### 4.2 Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)

#### 4.2.1 System Description
TCAS provides alerts and resolution advisories (RAs) to avoid collisions with other aircraft [44]. It operates by receiving and processing transponder signals from nearby aircraft.

#### 4.2.2 Attack Description
The attacker generates false TCAS responses for a non-existent intruder aircraft, causing RAs. This requires expensive equipment and the ability to cover a large geographic area, making it a powerful attack suitable for nation-states. Smaller-scale attacks could be carried out by less well-equipped attackers.

#### 4.2.3 Expected Response
Pilots are expected to comply with the first RA, but some may eventually doubt the RAs and reduce the alert level or switch off the system. On average, we expect participants to follow 3-4 RAs before taking action.

#### 4.2.4 Simulator Implementation
In the simulator, we enact a strong attacker covering a large geographic area, attempting to trigger 10 alerts. False aircraft begin to be injected when the target aircraft flies above 2000 ft. If the participant reduces TCAS sensitivity to TA-Only, they will still receive TAs but not RAs.

### 4.3 Instrument Landing System (ILS)

#### 4.3.1 System Description
ILS allows precision landings in poor weather conditions, consisting of localizer (LOC) and glideslope (GS) components [21]. The LOC provides lateral guidance, while the GS provides vertical guidance. Transmission powers are 5 W for GS and 100 W for LOC, with overlapping 90 Hz and 150 Hz lobes providing guidance.

#### 4.3.2 Attack Description
The attacker interferes with ILS signals, causing misalignment and incorrect vertical guidance. This can lead to missed approaches, diversions, or switching off the system. The attack requires precise timing and frequency manipulation.

#### 4.3.3 Expected Response
Pilots are expected to notice the misalignment and take corrective action, possibly performing a missed approach or diverting to another airport. Some may switch off the ILS and rely on other navigation aids.

#### 4.3.4 Simulator Implementation
In the simulator, we simulate ILS interference by introducing signal disruptions, causing misalignment and incorrect vertical guidance. Participants are expected to notice the issues and take appropriate action.

## 5. Experimental Method

We recruited 30 professional Airbus A320 pilots to fly scenarios in a flight simulator. The pilots were subjected to realistic cyber attacks on the GPWS, TCAS, and ILS systems. We collected control input data and conducted interviews to analyze their responses.

## 6. Results

All three attack scenarios caused significant control impact and disruption, including missed approaches, avoidance maneuvers, and diversions. The attacks also increased workload and distrust in the affected systems, with at least a third of participants switching off the systems. All pilots found the scenarios useful, with 93.3% agreeing that simulator training for wireless attacks could be valuable.

## 7. Discussion

The results highlight the need for further attention to the security of avionics systems. Pilots' responses to the attacks varied, but the overall impact was significant. Future work could focus on more destructive attacks and the development of countermeasures.

## 8. Lessons Learned

The study underscores the importance of incorporating cyber attack scenarios into pilot training. It also highlights the need for robust security measures in avionics systems to prevent and mitigate such attacks.

## 9. Conclusion

This study provides insights into how pilots respond to wireless attacks on avionics systems. The findings suggest that while pilots can manage some attacks, there is a need for enhanced training and security measures to ensure the safety of air travel. Future research should continue to explore the impact of more sophisticated and destructive attacks.
