infrastructure that is associated with the TopHat system [6]. We employed TDMI
agents at over 230 PlanetLab nodes worldwide (accessed through PlanetLab Eu-
rope, http://planet-lab.eu) that we chose for their relative stability. Each
agent performed one measurement round per hour, for a total of R = 1480
rounds. A round consisted of Paris Traceroutes towards 800 destinations, which
are themselves PlanetLab nodes. With Paris Traceroute, we traced a single path
per source-destination pair, taking care to use the same ﬂow identiﬁer each
time.
For each round r, we aggregate the discovered paths to build a directed graph
Gr = (Er,Vr) that we refer to as the network topology. Since there are typi-
cally unresponsive interfaces, or ‘stars’, in a route trace, and since non-public or
otherwise illegal IP addresses can also appear, we deﬁne an edge e ∈ Er to consist
of two consecutive legitimate interfaces (public IP addresses), v1, v2 ∈ Vr, sep-
arated by a number (cid:2)− 1, possibly zero, of unknown interfaces: e = (v1, v2, (cid:2)).

We term network topology dynamism to be the symmetric diﬀerence be-
pearance of a vertex or an edge between rounds is a dynamic event.
The graphs on average contained 13,950 vertices and 61,881 edges. Fig. 2(a)
plots the rate of dynamic events per round. We see that vertex dynamism,
|Vr ΔVr−1|/|Vr|, represents a small portion of approximately 2% of all vertices,
whereas edge dynamism, |Er ΔEr−1|/|Er|, represents on average 20% of the
edges. We attribute the relatively high proportion of edge dynamism to the
appearance and disappearance of unknown interfaces, a phenomenon already
noted by Gunes and Sarac [16].
Discovery Budget: The discovery budget is the number of probes that are sent
per round. Fig. 2(b) shows the budget when using NTC as a proportion of the
budget consumed by conducting full traces, plotting the averages over all rounds.
Depending upon the particular values of α and β that we choose, the budget is
anywhere from 6% to 24% of the full trace budget. Since we still obtain excellent

coverage (see below), this means that our NTC heuristics outperform the state
of the art Doubletree, which in a similar scenario uses a probing budget of at
best 25% of the full trace budget [10].
Network Topology Coverage: The network topology coverage is the propor-
tion of the graph that is discovered in an NTC round, in comparison to the graph
that is obtained from full traces. If V(α, β)r ⊆ Vr is the set of vertices discov-
ered under NTC, with parameters α and β, in round r, the vertex coverage for
that round is |V(α, β)r|/|Vr|, edge coverage being calculated similarly. We plot
the mean coverage over all rounds. We see in Fig. 3(a) that vertex coverage is
between 98% and 99%, and in Fig. 3(b) that edge coverage varies between 82%
and 95%, depending upon the parameter choices. For comparison, Doubletree,
in similar circumstances, covers at most 93% of the edges that are seen in a full
trace (and, as just noted, for a higher discovery budget).
Dynamic Event Capture: As for budget and coverage metrics, we calculate
dynamic event capture as a proportion, comparing the results when applying the
NTC heuristics to those of full traces. If dr is the vertex dynamism, as deﬁned
above, for full traces, and d(α, β)r is the vertex dynamism between the vertices
V(α, β)r ⊆ Vr found in round r, and the vertices V(α, β)r−1 ⊆ Vr−1 found in
round r − 1, under NTC, then the vertex capture rate is d(α, β)r/dr. Similarly
for the edge capture rate.
Fig. 4(a) shows that the NTC heuristics capture over 80% of the vertex dy-
namics, and as much as 96% for the parameters that we studied. In Fig. 4(b),
we see that the corresponding ﬁgures for edge dynamics are 44% and 75%. As
we have already noted, we believe that a large part of edge dynamism results
from changes in unknown interfaces, such as a ‘star’ appearing or disappearing
in a route trace, and these dynamic events prove comparatively hard to capture.

6 Summary and Future Work
This paper has opened a new approach to distributed network route tracing: one
that uses partial traces, guided by knowledge from prior probing, in order to more
eﬃciently obtain the network graph. Simulations of our NTC (Network Topology
Capture) heuristics on actual route traces show the potential for considerable
savings (in this case, of 94% in the discovery budget while still covering 95%
of the edges in the graph that is revealed by full traces). This should make it
possible to conduct signiﬁcantly more probing rounds within the same time on
a ﬁxed budget.
Approaches such as this should make it possible for large-scale tracing systems
to better capture network dynamics. This paper looked, for the ﬁrst time, at the
impact of lowering the probing budget on the quality of dynamics capture.
We have only started to examine possible heuristics, and future work will look
for yet more eﬃcient ones than we describe here. We will strive to have such
heuristics incorporated into production systems. These systems would provide
the basis for a range of interesting studies of the network dynamics that they
reveal.
