### 5.1 Facebook: Account Hijacking via SMS Spoofing

Facebook encourages users to register their phone numbers by continuously displaying a reminder dialog, as shown in Figure 7. This practice, while intended for security, can be exploited through SMS spoofing.

**Attack and Negative Impacts:**
By leveraging the SMS spoofing threat, an attacker can hijack a victim's Facebook account without their awareness. Since there is no runtime authentication, the victim will not receive any confirmation messages or be involved in the attack. We developed an Android application, named HackFacebook, to execute this attack. The application does not require root access but only network permissions. It can also be converted into malware to launch attacks from non-attacker phones.

To validate the attack feasibility, we used HackFacebook to target a victim's phone with the number XXX-YYYY-4347, associated with the Facebook account "ResearchOne." We employed HackFacebook on a non-victim phone to update the status, add a new friend, and like a page, as shown in Figures 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), respectively. The activity logs of the victim's account, as shown in Figure 8(d), confirmed the success of these actions. This attack can further be used to disclose the victim's private information (e.g., friends, family members, photos) because the attacker can add a fake account as one of the victim's friends without their consent. Consequently, the attacker can obtain all the information that the victim shares with their friends on Facebook.

### 5.2 American Red Cross: Unauthorized Donation

The American Red Cross (ARC), a non-profit humanitarian organization, allows mobile users to make donations via SMS, a service known as Mobile Giving. For example, to donate $10, a user can send an SMS with the text "REDCROSS" to the number 90999. The user then receives a confirmation request and must reply with "YES" to complete the donation, which is charged to their monthly bill. While convenient, this service has vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unauthorized donations.

**Vulnerabilities:**
We identified two security vulnerabilities in the Mobile Giving service:
1. **Weak Authorization:** The service relies solely on a static response text (i.e., "YES"), making it vulnerable to manipulation if the attacker can intercept the victim's SMS.
2. **Automatic Enrollment:** Most US carriers, including AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile, automatically enroll their users in the Mobile Giving service without explicit notification. This lack of awareness can lead to monetary loss if the service is abused.

**Attack and Negative Impacts:**
An attacker can make an unauthorized donation from the victim's mobile bill by launching an SMS spoofing attack against the Mobile Giving service. Due to the weak authorization, the attack can be executed without the victim's involvement. To demonstrate this, we developed an application, DonateARC, based on HackFacebook. Unlike HackFacebook, DonateARC sends two consecutive SMS messages to the number 90999. The first message contains "REDCROSS," and the second contains "YES." A 5-second interval between the messages ensures successful delivery, as our experiments show that 95% of SMS messages are delivered within 5 seconds.

To validate the attack, we used DonateARC to make an unauthorized $10 donation to ARC from a victim's mobile bill. The victim, a lab member, was notified of the unauthorized donation via the confirmation request but had no way to stop the ongoing attack.

### 5.3 The Home Depot: Unauthorized Subscription

The Home Depot, an American home improvement retailer, offers SMS advertising to customers. To subscribe, a customer needs to provide their phone number and email address on the Home Depot website. After subscribing, the customer receives a confirmation request via SMS and must reply with "Y" to confirm. Similar to the unauthorized donation attack, the subscription process can be abused.

**Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the weak authorization procedure for subscriptions, which relies on a static response text (i.e., "Y"). By exploiting SMS spoofing, an attacker can subscribe the victim to SMS advertising without their consent.

**Attack and Negative Impacts:**
An attacker can make an unauthorized subscription, causing the victim to receive unwanted SMS advertisements, leading to annoyance. The attack method is similar to the unauthorized donation attack, involving two steps: requesting the subscription and sending a confirmation SMS. The main difference is that the first step is done on the website rather than via SMS. We validated this attack by subscribing a victim to The Home Depot's SMS advertising using SMS spoofing. Our experiments showed that the victim received up to 10 SMS messages per month. If applied on a large scale, this could result in numerous complaints and damage The Home Depot's reputation.

### 5.4 Feasibility Study of Large-scale Attacks

We conducted a feasibility study to determine the potential for large-scale attacks using OP-I. To avoid traceback, the attacker would ideally launch attacks from malware on other phones. We examined the limitations of sending a large number of forged SMS messages from such malware.

In our experiments, we used the HackFacebook application to send as many forged SMS messages as possible to another phone within 30 minutes. We also tested the default messaging application for comparison. The results, shown in Figure 9, indicate that HackFacebook can deliver SMS messages 33 times faster than the default application. The default application could send no more than 30 SMS messages within 30 minutes, while HackFacebook successfully delivered 2459 and 1002 messages before and after April 2015, respectively. This suggests that malware can launch large-scale attacks at a rate of at least 33 SMS messages per minute. Additionally, we observed a cap of 30 SMS messages per 30 minutes when using the Android SMS API, which HackFacebook bypasses. After April 2015, it appears that OP-I implemented a network-based SMS control to limit the delivery speed.

### 5.5 Lessons Learned

Most SMS-powered service providers rely on mobile networks for user authentication, assuming that phone numbers cannot be spoofed. However, when mobile networks are susceptible to SMS spoofing, these services become vulnerable. Given the variety of mobile networks globally, it is challenging for service providers to ensure security. Therefore, SMS-powered services should implement their own authentication mechanisms. Moreover, users who do not subscribe to these services may still be at risk due to automatic enrollment by some service providers or carriers, which is unfair.

### 6. Recommended Solutions

We propose solutions to address IMS-based SMS threats, considering feasibility, standard compatibility, deployment cost, and industry feedback.

**Mobile Phone:**
1. **SMS Access Defense:** Mobile OS should prevent applications from accessing SMS using methods other than the SMS API. This can be achieved by restricting the IMS-specific interface to IMS-related applications only.
2. **Additional Security for SMS Client:** The SMS client should have an additional security layer, such as hiding the destination address or adding security challenges. These measures can increase the difficulty of forging SMS messages and prevent attacks even on rooted phones.

**Mobile Network:**
The network should provide a secure binding between the client's IP address and the originator identifier (phone number) specified in SIP/SMS messages. The IMS server should verify the originator phone number in each SIP message and drop it if spoofed. Alternatively, the originator information can be specified by the network, ensuring that the early binding of the SIP session is maintained.

**SMS-powered Service Provider:**
1. **User Confirmation:** Subscription to SMS-powered services should be confirmed by the user to prevent spoofing attacks.
2. **Dynamic Authentication:** Each service request should include a dynamic short code or secret code to authenticate the user. For example, to like a page on Facebook via SMS, the message should include a secret code. This approach, adopted by Facebook as MobilePIN, enhances security without requiring additional applications.

### 7. Discussion

**Other Carriers' IMS-based SMS:**
We further examined whether the discovered vulnerabilities exist in other major US carriers, denoted as OP-III and OP-IV for privacy.
