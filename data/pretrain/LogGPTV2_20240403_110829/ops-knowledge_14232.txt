User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题DNSAPI Error 11166 on Windows 2003 member server One of my servers is raising an event log error for DNS with the details shown below.

Any suggestions for resolving this?

(Worth mentioning is that 100.150 is a secondary IP address assigned to 100.1)

 Event Type:    Warning Event
 Source:    DnsApi 
 Event Category:    None
 Event ID:  11166 
 Date:      27/05/2009
 Time:      10:57:24 
 
Assistant: Does the server sending the updates (and failing) have the .1 or the .150 address as its primary DNS server?
Maybe worth checking the DNS server bindings on .1
