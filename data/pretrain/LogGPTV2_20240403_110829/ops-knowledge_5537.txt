User:  How to avoid concurrency problems in Java development? Please provide code samples.
Assistant: The following methods can be used to avoid concurrency problems in Java: 1. The synchronized keyword Use the synchronized keyword to control access to shared resources to ensure that only one thread can access the resource at the same time. Sample code: ``` public class MyThread implements Runnable { private int count = 100; public synchronized void run() { while (count > 0) { count--; System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName( ) + " : " + count); } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { MyThread thread = new MyThread(); new Thread(thread, "Thread 1").start(); new Thread(thread, "Thread 2").start(); } } ``` 2. ReentrantLock Use the ReentrantLock class to achieve thread synchronization, similar to the synchronized keyword, but provide richer features, such as interruptible locks, timing lock etc. Sample code: ``` public class MyThread implements Runnable { private int count = 100; private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(); public void run() { while (count > 0) { try { lock.lock(); count- -; System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + count); } finally { lock.unlock(); } } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { MyThread thread = new MyThread(); new Thread(thread, "Thread 1").start(); new Thread(thread, "Thread 2").start(); } } ``` 3. AtomicInteger usage The AtomicInteger class implements atomic operations on shared variables, avoiding inconsistencies under multi-threading. Sample code: ``` public class MyThread implements Runnable { private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(100); public void run() { while (count.get() > 0) { int value = count.getAndDecrement(); System. out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " : " + value); } } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { MyThread thread = new MyThread(); new Thread( thread, "Thread 1").start(); new Thread(thread, "Thread 2").start(); } } ```
