### Mutual Authentication Protocols in WSN and IoT

In the context of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), numerous studies [31, 47, 50, 53, 55, 56] have proposed arbitrated mutual authentication protocols for various scenarios. These include:
- Authentication between a user and the gateway node [53, 56].
- Mutual authentication involving all three parties: the user, the gateway node, and the sensor node [24].
- Authentication between a specific user and a specific sensor node [29, 55].

#### Differences in IoT Remote Binding

Unlike WSN authentication, IoT remote binding does not involve direct mutual authentication between the device and the user. Instead, both the user and the device are authenticated to the cloud, which then enforces access control and relays messages between them. In our adversary model, the attacker is considered an insider who has already obtained a device identity, which contrasts with WSN studies that typically assume the attacker is an outsider.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no established standard protocols for IoT remote binding. This is partly due to the relative novelty of IoT as a research topic, and the lack of formal verification for existing vendor-provided solutions. Formal verification of these solutions' security properties will be part of our future work.

### Authorization in IoT

Previous studies have focused on coarse-grained authorization in IoT applications and clouds [32–34, 39, 49]. For example:
- **SmartAuth** [49] uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to bridge the gap between code behaviors and high-level functionalities in IoT app descriptions, providing fine-grained access control.
- **ContexIoT** [39] leverages context information for more granular access control over sensitive actions in IoT platforms.
- **Earlence et al.** [32] conducted an empirical security analysis of a smart home programming platform, revealing that the cloud-side privilege separation model can lead to significant over-privilege issues.
- **FlowFence** [33] addresses the ineffectiveness of permission-based access control in managing sensitive data flows by embedding user-intended data flow patterns.

Our study takes a novel approach by systematically analyzing the entire lifecycle of remote binding in IoT, encompassing both device authentication and user authorization.

### Security Analysis of IoT Devices

There is growing interest in the security of IoT devices [22, 27, 28, 37, 38, 45]. Research in this area can be broadly categorized into two directions:
1. **Security Analysis**: Researchers have developed techniques to discover implementation flaws and explore attack vectors. For instance:
   - **Costin et al.** [27] analyzed 32,000 firmware images and identified 38 previously unknown vulnerabilities, highlighting the poor implementation of today's IoT firmware.
   - **Müller et al.** [45] conducted a systematic study on network printers, summarizing existing attacks and designing a tool to detect known attacks.
   - **Ho et al.** [38] studied five popular smart locks and discovered new attacks that could leak information and even unlock the doors.
2. **Defense Techniques**: Various methods have been proposed to separate privileges in IoT systems. For example:
   - **Abraham et al.** [26] implemented a runtime privilege overlay to provide stack protections and diversification of code and data regions in bare-metal systems.

Our study differs from these works by focusing on cloud-side authorization and device authentication to prevent unauthorized control and denial-of-service attacks.

### Conclusion

This paper presents the first systematic study on the lifecycle of remote binding in IoT. We demystify the design principles of IoT remote binding using a state machine, where the procedures of remote binding are represented as cloud-side device state transitions in response to messages from the device and the user. This model enabled us to systematically identify four types of attacks: sensitive user data leaks, persistent denial-of-service, connection disruption, and stealthy device control. We also conducted case studies and successfully launched attacks on ten popular IoT devices, demonstrating the prevalence of these threats in the real world.
