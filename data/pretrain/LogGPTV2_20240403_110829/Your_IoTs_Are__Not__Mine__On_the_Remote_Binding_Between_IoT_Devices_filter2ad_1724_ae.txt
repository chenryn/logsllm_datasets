with either the gateway node or a sensor node. For those
WSN studies [31], [47], [50], [53], [55], [56], researchers
proposed arbitrated mutual authentication protocols under var-
ious scenarios, such as authentication between a user and the
gateway node [53], [56], mutual authentication between all
three parties [24], and authentication between a particular user
and a particular sensor node [29], [55].

Different from WSN authentication scenarios, in IoT remote
binding, the device and the user are not authenticated to each
other. Instead, the user and the device are both authenticated
to the cloud. Based on that, the cloud then enforces access
control and eventually relay messages between them. On the
other hand, the attacker in our adversary model is regarded
as an insider who already obtains a device identity. This is
different from the WSN studies that assume the attacker is an
outsider.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study about
remote binding standard protocols. The main reason is that
IoT is a new topic, and the remote binding of IoT has not
been studied by researchers. Although nowadays some vendors
provide remote binding solutions, those homemade solutions
are not formally veriﬁed. It is our future work to formally
verify their security properties.
Authorization in IoT. Prior studies also have been focusing on
coarse-grained authorization in IoT apps and IoT clouds [32]–
[34], [39], [49]. For example, SmartAuth [49] is an NLP-based
framework to bridge the gap between real behaviors in code
and high-level functionalities in the descriptions of IoT apps,
providing ﬁne-grained access control. ContexIoT [39] utilizes
context information for more ﬁne-grained access control of
sensitive actions in IoT platforms. Moreover, Earlence et
al. [32] performed an empirical security analysis of one emerg-
ing smart home programming platform and found that the
cloud-side privilege separation model could lead to signiﬁcant
over-privilege. FlowFence [33] tries to address the problem
that existing permission-based access control is ineffective at
controlling how sensitive data ﬂows in apps, by embedding
user intended data ﬂow patterns. Different from those works,
our study takes the ﬁrst step to systematically analyze the
entire life cycle of remote binding in IoT, which involves
device authentication and user authorization.
Security analysis of IoT. Besides, researchers also have a
increasing interest in the security of IoT devices [22], [27],
[28], [37], [38], [45]. At a high level, their works can be
categorized into two directions: performing security analysis
on IoT devices and proposing defense techniques to tackle
coarse-grained privilege separation. On the one hand, given
that security analysis of IoT devices faces huge challenges,
researchers propose various techniques to discover implemen-
tation ﬂaws and explore attack vectors. For instance, Costin et
al. [27] performed a large scale analysis of implementation
ﬂaws in 32 thousand ﬁrmware images and discovered 38
previously unknown vulnerabilities,
today’s
ﬁrmware of IoT devices is poorly implemented. For ex-
ploration of attack vectors, M¨uller et al. [45] performed a
systematic study on network printers by summarizing existing
attacks and designing a tool to detect known attacks. Ho et
al. [38] studied 5 popular smart locks and discovered several
new attacks to leak information and even unlock the doors. On
the other hand, researchers propose various techniques [25],
[26], [40] to separate privileges for IoT systems. For instance,
Abraham et al. [26] implemented a runtime privilege overlay
indicating that
to provide protections (stack protections and diversiﬁcation of
code and data regions) for bare-metal systems. Different from
those works, our study exploits cloud-side authorization and
device authentication to take control of devices or to cause
denial-of-service to users.
X. CONCLUSION
This paper reports the ﬁrst systematic study on the life
cycle of remote binding in IoT. To understand the security
threat, we demystify various design principles of IoT remote
binding with a state machine, in which the procedures of
remote binding are represented as cloud-side device state
transitions in response to primitives messages sent by the
device and the user. This process model provided us a unique
observation of the remote binding process, which enables us
to systematically discover four types of attacks: sensitive user
data leak, persistent denial-of-service, connection disruption,
and stealthy device control. We also carried out case studies
and successfully launched attacks on 10 popular IoT devices,
which reveals the prevalence of our attacks in the real world.
