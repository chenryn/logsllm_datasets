On a ES 1.4.2 cluster, I am trying to transiently set the log level of search
slowlogs via the API:
    curl -s -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_cluster/settings' -d '
    {
        "transient" : {
            "logger.index.search.slowlog.query" : "INFO"
        }
    }'
I confirmed that the transient setting is stored in the cluster with a GET on
the same path.
However I still have many DEBUG log events in my slowlogs. What am I doing
wrong? Is this a known issue?
