### Figure 12: Composition of the Filtered Data Set by Political Leaning and Origin Publisher List

(a) Non-Misinformation Pages  
(b) Misinformation Pages

**Description:**
- In the middle and bottom rows of each plot, news publisher pages are weighted by total interactions and followers, respectively.
- Overlap between the two lists is smallest in the center and larger at the extremes.
- Overlap increases when pages are weighted by interactions or followers.

**Key Observations:**
- The distribution of pages, interactions, and followers across the political spectrum differs significantly between non-misinformation and misinformation pages.
- Based on our source lists (NG and MB/FC), slightly left misinformation pages account for a disproportionately low 7 out of 386 slightly left pages overall.
- Far-right misinformation pages (109) are disproportionately numerous compared to the 154 far-right non-misinformation pages.
- Absolute numbers of pages per political leaning and (mis)information status can be found on the x-axis of Figure 2.
