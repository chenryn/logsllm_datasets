PrivAd: Practical Private-by-Design Advertising System
PrivAd is a private-by-design advertising system, which enables behavioral targeting
without revealing user online behavior or user interest proﬁles to the ad network. De-
veloped several online ad auction designs for PrivAd, which allow it to operate within
the current business model (cost-per-click second price auction). Analyzed auction de-
signs in terms of privacy risks, potential attack vectors and the impact on the targeting
quality and revenue streams. Built a fully operational PrivAd prototype equipped with
a di↵erentially private analytics mechanism. Deployed and evaluated the system at
scale with more than 13K opted-in users.
Graduate Student advised by Krishna Gummadi

Collaborative BitTorrent (CBT)
Designed and implemented an extension to the BitTorrent protocol that allows socially
connected users (i.e., friends who are willing to share their bandwidth with each other)
to team up and engage in a collaborative distributed task to speed up the process of
downloading a piece of content. Complementary resources provided by friends enabled
CBT clients to achieve a signiﬁcant improvement over vanilla protocol in the download
performance. Built and evaluated a prototype on top of the Azureus BitTorrent client.

Software Engineering Intern
Google, Mountain View, USA
Contributed to design and implementation of Photon – a large-scale stateful distributed
system for joining multiple continuously ﬂowing streams of data with extremely high
scalability and low latency. Photon is designed to withstand infrastructure degrada-
tion and datacenter-level outages without any manual intervention, providing signiﬁ-
cantly better fault-tolerance and lower maintenance overhead compared to typical single-
datacenter systems. Photon is currently deployed within Google Advertising System to
join multiple data streams generating joined logs critical for key business metrics.
Software Engineering Intern
Google, Zurich, Switzerland
Designed, implemented and deployed a service to provide advertisers with an additional
feedback channel on e↵ectiveness of their video ad campaigns on YoutTube. At the
core of this service is a ranking algorithm that extracts useful signal from the bulk of
user-generated comments.
Summer 2011
Software Engineering Intern
Google, Munich, Germany
Contributed to the Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) project whose goal is to enable
users to create and execute applications written in scripting languages directly on their
Android devices. Brought SL4A to a qualitatively new level by adding concurrent
execution of multiple scripts and ability to distribute interpreters and scripts as stand-
alone APKs, which enabled developers to distribute their application through Android
Market. Additionally, enhanced UI and performance, added a number of supported
APIs.
