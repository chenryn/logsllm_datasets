User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: When you add the python directory to the path (Computer > Properties > Advanced System Settings > Advanced > Environmental Variables > System Variables > Path > Edit), remember to add a semicolon, then make sure that you are adding the precise directory where the file "python.exe" is stored (e.g. C:\Python\Python27 if that is where "python.exe" is stored).  Then restart the command prompt.
