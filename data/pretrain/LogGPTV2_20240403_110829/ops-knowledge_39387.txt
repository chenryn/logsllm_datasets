When you type `python` into the command line and receive the error message "python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file," it indicates that the Python executable is not in your system's PATH. Hereâ€™s how to resolve this issue:

1. **Locate the Python Installation Directory:**
   - You mentioned having both Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed. Identify the directory where the `python.exe` file is located for the version of Python you want to use. For example, if you want to use Python 2.7, the directory might be `C:\Python27`.

2. **Add Python to the System PATH:**
   - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables" (or go to `Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables`).
   - In the "System Variables" section, find the `Path` variable and select it, then click "Edit."
   - In the "Edit environment variable" window, click "New" and add the path to the Python directory (e.g., `C:\Python27`).
   - If you also need to use Python 3.2, add its directory in a similar manner (e.g., `C:\Python32`).

3. **Ensure Proper Formatting:**
   - Each entry in the `Path` variable should be separated by a semicolon (`;`). Make sure there is no trailing semicolon at the end.

4. **Save and Apply Changes:**
   - Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes and save the changes.

5. **Restart the Command Prompt:**
   - Close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one to ensure the changes take effect.

6. **Verify the Installation:**
   - Type `python --version` in the Command Prompt to check if Python is now recognized and to confirm the version.

By following these steps, you should be able to run Python from the command line without encountering the "not recognized" error.
