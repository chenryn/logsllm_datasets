For the outbound distribution, the highest outbound degrees are
significantly smaller, at 587 created and 465 completed contracts. In
other words, the most highly-connected nodes are formed mostly
by inbound connections (accepting contracts) rather than making
connection (initialising contracts) to others. For the most popular
type – Sale, we observe many users initiating transactions, with a
much smaller number of users accepting them. The outbound dis-
tribution is slightly different from raw and inbound as the number
of nodes having zero connection is much smaller. Other than the
zero point, outbound degrees also follow a power-law distribution.
Social Network Evolution. Figure 8 shows the average degree,
max raw, inbound, and outbound degrees have increased over time.
While the maximum outbound degree has gradually increased, the
maximum raw, inbound, and average degrees have risen more dra-
matically. The max raw and max inbound are nearly identical, shar-
ing the same pattern thoroughly (they overlap in the figure). While
there was a gradual increase of all degree types during Set-up,
there was a big uplift in Stable, when max raw and max inbound
rocketed. Therefore, we believe the majority of raw degrees are
made by inbound connections, suggesting the effect to the social
network is mostly due to accepting transactions. No substantial
change is observed during Covid-19, indicating the pandemic has
not significantly affected the market in terms of contractual rela-
tionships. For both completed and created transactions the average
degree grew gradually, suggesting a stable development of the con-
tractual network. There was a slight drop in March 2019, which we
believe is due to the sudden increase of the number of users, thus
decreasing the average degree of the network. These new users also
quickly contributed a large number of new contracts (see Figure 1).
4.3 Trading Activities
To classify trading activities, we first extract the obligation section
in all public contracts, then apply normalisation techniques, such

IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA
Figure 9: The evolution of top five products offered
leads further support to the idea that reputation plays a prominent
role in the community. Multimedia (design, illustration and video
editing) has the lowest proportion of unique members, indicating
users tend to initiate and complete more repeated contracts for this
category. The number of delivery/shipping takers are seven times
higher than makers, demonstrating an imbalance in demand. We see
academic help, which includes assistance with homework, essays
and dissertations, accounts for a small proportion of transactions.
The Evolution. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the top five prod-
ucts over the three eras. We exclude currency exchange and payments
here and separately examine these in §4.4. Overall, giftcard is the
most popular traded product in all three eras. Gaming-related peaks
during Set-up, but drops to the lowest position by the end of Sta-
ble. Hackforums-related also grows in Set-up, but slips back to
fourth position by the end of this era. In Stable, accounts/licenses
consistently take the second-highest position. Despite the increased
number of contracts at the beginning of Stable (see Figure 1), the
number of contracts in the top five categories does not grow rapidly
– some even decrease over time. This is likely due to the decline in
the number of public contracts (see Figure 2), with users moving to
private contracts where the details are hidden. We see a rapid stim-
ulus of all activities during Covid-19. While there is a consistent
increase of multimedia, the others perform a rapid but short-lived
peak. At the end of the era, hackforums-related comes to take the
highest position, despite placing last at the beginning of Set-up,
suggesting a high demand for reputation, while multimedia takes
the second position and giftcard drops to its lowest ever position.
4.4 Payment Methods
As currency exchange and payments account for most trading activ-
ities, we take a closer look at the types of currencies and payment
methods used. We first take all the contracts classified into cur-
rency exchange, payments, and giftcard, then apply another regular
expression set to categorise the payments used. As shown in Ta-
ble 4, Bitcoin and PayPal are the most popular payment methods,
accounting for 75% and 38% of completed contracts, respectively.
Amazon Giftcards are ranked third. The most wanted fiat is USD
while JPY, GBP, EUR, and CAD account for a tiny proportion of
transactions (not shown in the table). Other cryptocurrencies, in-
cluding Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, and Monero, account for
trivial proportions, indicating that despite its limitations, Bitcoin
is still a popular cryptocurrency on the underground marketplace.

Figure 10: The evolution of top five preferred payment meth-
ods used in completed public contracts
The highest rate of repeat transactions is of V-Bucks (Fortnite’s
in-game currency), with 8.37 transactions per trader.
The Evolution. Figure 10 shows the evolution of top payment
methods in completed contracts. Bitcoin and PayPal dominate in all
three eras, confirming findings in prior research [19, 22]. Amazon
Giftcards retain third place most of the time. After peaking in the
early stage of Set-up, the number of contracts for the top three
payment methods gradually declines. USD surpasses Cashapp in
Set-up, then drops to fifth position, where it remains. There is a
gradual downtrend in Stable, despite the increased number of con-
tracts and members at the beginning of this era (see Figure 1). Again,
we believe this is because many users chose private transactions
when contracts became mandatory (Figure 2). In Covid-19, there is
a short-lived rise in contracts for all payment methods, particularly
Bitcoin and PayPal. At the end of this era, Cashapp outpaces PayPal
and Amazon Giftcards to second place, its highest ever ranking.
4.5 Trading Values
We estimate the trading values for completed contracts, ignoring
Vouch Copy (as they are proofs of reputation rather than an eco-
nomic trades). We apply regular expressions to extract the trading
values and currency denominations quoted in the maker/taker obli-
gation sections. Note the extracted values are from the contractual
arrangements, rather than actual transactions. The trading volume

is then estimated by counting all extracted values naively, as there
is no way to confirm if transactions actually went through as de-
scribed. We assume any goods without a value and denomination
specified, such as ‘dissertation’, have an equal value with the oppo-
site side. If the values of both sides cannot be estimated, the contract
value is ignored. If a transaction results in double counting, where
there are values observed in both the maker and taker sides (e.g.,
currency exchange), we take the average as the final value. If no
specific denomination is declared, or it cannot be inferred from
the text, we consider it to be USD, as this is the currency most
transactions are traded in (followed by GBP, CAD, EUR, AUD, and
INR). We then convert all values to USD using the conversion rates
at the time the transactions were made.
To estimate the trading values more precisely, we manually check
the 163 high-value (exceeding 1,000 USD) transactions, which is
found mostly related to Bitcoin and PayPal (or Cashapp) exchanges.
We then verify these by manually reading the obligations, terms,
payments information, ratings, and advertising threads (if any) to
identify actual values. For contracts providing a Bitcoin address
and/or transaction hash, we additionally check recorded transac-
tions on the blockchain at the completion time. If we can not deter-
mine values for both sides of the contract, it is excluded. We found
in many cases values exceeding $10,000 are likely due to typing
errors. Of the 163 high-value trades, 82 (50%) are confirmed, 11 (7%)
could not be confirmed, and 70 (43%) have a different (usually lower)
trading value. We also see indications of private negotiations, for ex-
ample, one service is advertised at $1,000 but the actual transaction
(verified on the blockchain) is $200, In some cases the transaction
value on the blockchain is higher, for example, a contract stating
$1,250 Bitcoin but a transaction value of $1,800. We also observe
Bitcoin is often traded with a higher value than itself, for example,
$1,000 BTC for $1,080 PayPal, indicating Bitcoin is probably in high
demand compared to other cashout methods. We manually update
the contract details based on the new values observed.
The total value of public transactions across contracts with non-
zero values is estimated to be $978,800 (average $85, maximum
$9,861). Within each type, this corresponds to $461,484 in Exchange
(av. $104, max. $9,000), $304,783 in Sale (av. $71, max. $6,723),
$205,247 in Purchase (av. $78, max. $9,861) and $7,286 in Trade
(av. $58, max. $400). Table 5 show the values ranked by top 10
trading activities and payment methods. Note that these results
are naively calculated by summing the value of each activity. Thus,
their totals are higher than the total value of transactions estimated
above, as some transactions are classified into multiple categories.
With regards to trading activity, currency exchange accounts
for the highest value ($971,228), nearly double the second highest,
payment, followed by giftcard. They are also the top three trading
activities by number of contracts as shown in Table 3. By payment
methods, Bitcoin accounts for the highest amount ($809,283), nearly
2.5 times higher than PayPal ($334,425). A small number of members
are involved in a large proportion of the total value traded, with
the top 10% users party to over 70% of the total value. This again
demonstrates a high centrality of key members in the marketplace.
On average, a user who is party to at least one contract makes
around $185 of trading value during the entire period.
The actual trading values are likely to be much larger, as the
proportion of completed private contracts is over five times higher
than public ones which for the past year have accounted for only
15.7% of transactions. To estimate the value for both private and
public contracts, we assume private contracts are at least as valu-
able on average as public ones. We note more valuable transactions
accord a higher degree of risk of incrimination, and therefore may
be more likely to be private. One way to see the representation of
public transactions is looking at the disputed contracts, in which
the contract details became public from private. Among disputed
contracts, while most users are only involved in one dispute, we
observe one user has a relatively high record with 21 disputes. Oth-
erwise, we do not see any abnormal and questionable behaviour
in term of trading goods and services, with most disputed trans-
actions exchanging Bitcoin, and some relating to eWhoring. We
thus extrapolate by each contract type to gain a lower bound total
estimated value of $6,170,943 for both public and private contracts.
The Evolution. Figure 11 shows the evolution of monthly value
by contract types, top five payment methods, and top five product
categories traded over the three eras. Exchange generally accounts
for the highest value, followed by Sale and Purchase. Trade
consistently accounts for the smallest value. The value of Exchange
during Set-up declines from its peak in July 2018 to the lowest
position in this era in February 2019. After peaking during Set-up,
Sale and Purchase also gradually decrease towards the end of
Stable. In Covid-19, we observe a short-lived increase in Sale,
which for a while outpaces Exchange to become the highest value
in March and April 2020, however Exchange quickly resumes first
place afterwards. Purchase and Trade values, on the other hand,

Figure 11: The evolution of monthly value made by contract types, top five payment methods and top five products
did not increase much, showing a very high demand of Exchange
and Sale compared to others.
Bitcoin and PayPal dominate the other payment methods in all
three eras. However, the difference in value is considerably large.
During Set-up, the value made by Bitcoin and PayPal dropped
quickly, from its peak on July 2018, to its lowest point in this era
on February 2019, while others stayed at around $9,000-10,000 per
