User: I have installed Python 3.5.2 on my windows 8 computer, I tried in cmd python --version and it gave me that stupid error: 
"python is not recognized as an internal or external command..."
I also have no files named python on my computer anywhere. I used the search feature on file explorer and I've search manually. I even looked through the hidden files. I have tried to install Python 3 times and the same thing keeps happening. Any help appreciated.
Assistant: In Windows 8 for Python 3.* I believe it is:
C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\
To use that from the Windows command line you will need to add it to your path.  
Control Panel -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> Path
Add in the Python path at the end after a semi-colon, do not delete the others.
