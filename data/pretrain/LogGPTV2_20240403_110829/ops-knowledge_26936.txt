User: I'm a java developer/python beginner, and I'm missing my maven features, particularly dependency management and build automation (I mean you don't build, but how to create a package for deployment?)  
Is there a python equivalent to achieve these features?
Note: I use python 2.x
Thanks.
Assistant: It's good to use virtualenv to create standalone project environment and use pip/easy_install to management dependencies.
