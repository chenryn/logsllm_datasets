A REMOTE TIMINGS SCA EVALUATION:
ECDSA
As stated in the Introduction, as a secondary goal, we aimed at
reviewing the abstraction level at which SCA countermeasures
are implemented. Specifically, pushing for a secure-by-default ap-
proach, we proposed to move each one of the SCA countermeasures
discussed in this work at the lowest possible abstraction level.
As a result, the changes we proposed affected also other existing
cryptosystems, increasing their resistance to SCA. In particular, in
this section we evaluate the impact of our patchset on the ECDSA
cryptosystem, specifically when using generic prime curves (as op-
posed to curves for which an alternative optimized implementation
is specifically provided).
Figure 11 shows an empirical evaluation —similar to the one
presented in Section 4 and Section 7—on the impact of the proposed
mitigations on ECDSA over the secp256k1 [24] GLV prime curve
used in the BitCoin protocol.
Both plots show the latency dependency on the nonce length:
the top plot related to the OpenSSL implementation as of version
1.1.1-pre3, while the bottom plot shows the results after applying
the proposed patchset. Specifically, the original implementation
already applied the nonce padding and the FLT modular inversion

ECDSA signature generation over the secp256k1 prime
curve on amd64 architecture. Top: OpenSSL 1.1.1-pre3, in
which a wNAF algorithm is used to implement EC scalar
multiplication (see Section 5.1). Bottom: After applying our
patchset (see Section 7), most notably switching to a Mont-

of wNAF.
countermeasures, so the main change between the two implemen-
tations is due to adopting a Montgomery ladder algorithm for EC
scalar multiplication instead of the wNAF algorithm adopted in the
original implementation (see Section 7).
Comparing the two plots, our mitigations introduce an improve-
ment centered around the median values. This is due in part to the
fact that timings in the top plot depend on the weight of scalars,
while the timings in the bottom plot are independent of the weight.
This leads to lower deviations for the majority of data points cen-
tered around the median.
