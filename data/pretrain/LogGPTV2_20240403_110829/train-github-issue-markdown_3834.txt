I followed the tutorial and ran the `yo aspnet` command, selecting the Web API option. However, when I tried to execute the `dnx web` command by using the Command+Shift+P shortcut, it did not recognize the command. I was able to successfully run `dnx restore` from the terminal, but the `dnx web` command only worked when executed directly in the terminal. Do you have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?
