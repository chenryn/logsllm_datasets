User: I downloaded a deb package panda3d1.9_1.9.3-xenial_amd64.deb and I want to install it for Python 3. My OS is Linux Ubuntu 16.04. The default python is 2.7.12 and I would prefer to keep it as default, but Python 3 is installed too and available to use. How do I install this package for Python 3 only?
I am not sure pip may help.
Assistant: If the package was built to only support Python 2, there is no straightforward way to install it for Python 3.  You will want to ask the packager to provide a package built for Python 3 if there isn't one already.
(This replaces my earlier answer, which was incorrect or at least misleading.  Thanks to @Goyo in particular for setting me straight.)
