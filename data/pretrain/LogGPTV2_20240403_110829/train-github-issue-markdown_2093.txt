**Current behavior**  
In rc4, you could use the safe navigation/Elvis operator (?.) to guard against
nulls in property paths when using the async pipe - don't seem to be able to
in rc5.
    // Inside a template in rc5 - Assuming Observable var data which (will have) an id property:
    {{(data | async)?.id}} // throws error : TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of null
**Expected/desired behavior**  
As per rc4:
     {{(data | async)?.id}} // works as expected - id displays when data loaded
**Reproduction of the problem**  
rc4 - working as expected:

rc5 - not working/throwing error:

**What is the expected behavior?**  
Accessing properties of (currently) null values not to throw an error - the
Elvis operator would ideally guard against the error...
