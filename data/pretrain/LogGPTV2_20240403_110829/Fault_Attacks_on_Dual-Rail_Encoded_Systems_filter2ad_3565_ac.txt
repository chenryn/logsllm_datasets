Thus, even if none of the secret bits are taken as inputs
to gates along with known bits (where the attacks can learn
the secret bit in 1 trial), the attacker can expect to run only
about 1 1
8 trials per secret bit.4
4.2.1 Reset fault model summary
We have shown that dual-rail logic is not secure against
steady reset faults. It takes only about 1.125n trials to learn
n secret key bits. For some circuit conﬁgurations, the num-
ber of trials can be reduced to n.
We are unable to ﬁnd any workable attack in our transient
reset fault model.
5 Conclusion and Recommendations
We have proposed some threat models and analyzed the
efﬁcacy of dual-rail logic as a countermeasure against a va-
riety of types of induced faults. Since we have found ef-
ﬁcient attacks against dual-rail encoded systems, we must
conclude that dual-rail encoding is not a sufﬁcient counter-
measure against single fault attacks under the assumptions
of our models.
5.1 Recommendations within our models
Our attacks utilize induced faults to effectively probe in-
ternal logic values, and their success depends on the de-
terministic nature of the target systems. This observation
immediately suggests that randomization, a commonly sug-
gested defense against probing attacks, may perhaps be em-
ployed to defend against our fault attacks.
Alternatively, one may note that dual-rail logic is effec-
tively computing with an error-detecting code. This allows
dual-rail logic to detect errors and halt in an error state
and implementation considerations suggest that the ability to induce reset
faults implies the ability to induce set faults. Appendix A provides a more
detailed discussion.
4Here was assume that all unknown bits are interesting (i.e., only the n
secret bits are unknown). If uninteresting unknown bits are present, it may
take twice as many trials for the adversary to learn all secret bits.

rather than divulging an incorrect output that might give the
attacker enormous information [8]. Unfortunately, our at-
tacks and others [9] successful exploit this error state bit.
With this in mind, one could consider representing logic
values with an error-correcting code (ECC) rather than with
an error detecting code. If logic values were represented in
an ECC with a minimum distance of at least 3, single fault
errors in a logic value’s representation could be corrected
rather than just detected. Thus, single induced faults could
reliably result in valid computations rather than the data-
dependent behavior of possibly ending in an error state,
and this could thwart our attacks. Unfortunately, comput-
ing with an ECC would certainly be more expensive than
using dual-rail logic: an ECC would require at least 3 wires
to carry each bit, and even more wires would be necessary
to guarantee balanced power consumption.
5.2 Recommendations beyond our models
Perhaps our threat models are too strong. Due to uncer-
tainty about the target system and limitations of equipment,
attackers may not be able to cause precise single bit errors.
If we could develop models that accurately captured these
limitations, we should be able to argue rigorously that ap-
proaches like dual-rail encoding are secure. These results
would allow us to trust these designs as long as the attacker
limitation assumptions seemed realistic with respect to the
current state of technology.

A Physical motivation for attack models
The powerful yet surprisingly practical optical fault in-
duction attacks of Skorobogatov and Anderson [1] provide
the major motivation for our threat models. While previous
work will convince the reader that fault induction is deﬁ-
nitely a problem worth considering in the design of secure
embedded systems, we wish to go a little further into the
physics behind optical attacks.
In exploring a variety of fault types, we try to cover a suf-
ﬁciently large spectrum of potential fault induction methods
against a variety of digital logic families. In this section, we
attempt to give some of the background required to under-
stand how optical fault induction works and, as an example,
to justify that at least one of our threat models captures the
effect of optical faults against CMOS digital logic.
A.1 MOSFET basics
Enhancement-mode MOSFETs (Metal Oxide Semicon-
ductor Field Effect Transistors) are the basic components
of CMOS (Complementary MOSFET) digital logic.
Ide-
ally, a MOSFET behaves like a voltage-controlled switch:
the potential difference between the the electrically-isolated
metal5 gate and the bulk determines whether or not the de-
vice will allow charge to ﬂow between the source and drain.
Enhancement-mode MOSFETs come in two basic vari-
eties, n-channel and p-channel, depending on the type of
majority charge carrier (negative or positive) that is active
when the device is conducting. The two types behave in
a complementary manner: n-channel enhancement-mode
MOSFETs conduct when the gate voltage is positive rela-
tive to the bulk, while the p-channel variety conducts when
the gate voltage is negative relative to the bulk. Figure 4
gives commonly-used schematic representations of MOS-
FETs.
5Modern devices frequently have a non-metal polysilicon gate, and are
alternatively referred to as IGFETs (Isolated Gate Field Effect Transistors).

In each type of MOSFET, the source terminal is con-
nected to the supply of charge carriers: n-channel devices
have their source connected to the more negative input and
p-channel devices have their source connected to the posi-
tive input.
A.1.1 Mechanism
The behavior of semiconductors is a product of the inter-
play between the two types of semiconductor material: n-
type and p-type. These types of semiconductor material are
created by doping a relatively pure nonconductive crystal
(e.g., a crystal of silicon or germanium atoms) with different
atoms (e.g., phosphorus, arsenic, aluminum, or gallium).
The doped material has a surplus of charge carriers: n-type
material has an abundance of electrons that are not bound
in its crystal structure while p-type material has a dearth
of electrons—an abundance of holes in its crystal structure.
Each type of doped material will conduct charge.
The most interesting and useful behavior occurs when
the different types of material are joined in various conﬁgu-
rations. The basic effect utilized by semiconducting devices
is that, under normal conditions, current will ﬂow across a
p-n junction (a junction between p-type and n-type mate-
rials) only when the n-type material is negatively charged
relative to the p-material. For example, a diode, which per-
mits current ﬂow in only one direction, is nothing more than
a p-n junction.
A.1.2 MOSFET conﬁguration
An enhancement-mode MOSFET has one type of semicon-
ductor material at each of the source and drain terminals,
and a bulk (or substrate) of the other type of material sepa-
rating these regions. For example, an n-channel MOSFET
has n-type material at the source and drain inputs and a bulk
composed of p-type material. Figure 5 depicts an n-channel
enhancement-mode MOSFET.
This conﬁguration would normally not allow current to
ﬂow between the source and drain. To force the device in
Figure 5 to conduct, a positive charge is loaded onto the
gate. Although the gate is electrically isolated from the bulk

by a layer of nonconducting oxide, the charge on the gate
induces an electric ﬁeld that permeates the the p-type mate-
rial below. This electric charge attracts electrons (negative
charge carriers) to the region in the p-type material near the
gate. If enough charge is present on the gate to induce a
sufﬁciently strong electric ﬁeld, so many electrons will be
present in the affected region of the p-type material as to
make it behave as if it were n-type material. Thus a chan-
nel is created between the n-type regions at the source and
drain and current can ﬂow, with electrons being the majority
charge carrier.
The situation is similar in a p-channel MOSFET, ex-
cept the type of materials and charge carriers are reversed.
When a negative charge is present on the gate of a p-channel
device, electrons in the underlying n-type material are re-
pulsed, resulting in an abundance of holes. The affected re-
gion behaves like p-type material and a channel is formed.
A.2 Optically induced failure in n-channel MOS-
FETs
Loading the gate with a positive charge to induce an elec-
tric ﬁeld is not the only way to create a channel of majority
charge carrier electrons in the p-type material.
A.2.1 Electrons and photons
When electrons move through a crystal lattice, they pop in
and out of the covalent bonds that bind the atoms in the crys-
tal structure. An electron that is part of a bond has lower
potential energy than a free electron, so a free electron that
joins a covalent bond loses some energy. Where does this
energy go? It is released as a photon, a unit or quantum of
electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of the emitted

photon is determined by the amount of energy lost by the
electron: the more energy lost, the smaller the wavelength.
This phenomenon, known as the photoelectric effect, is uti-
lized in LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes), where the semicon-
ductor materials are speciﬁcally chosen so that the emitted
photons have desired wavelength of light.
What is important for us, however, is the opposite effect:
if an electron in a covalent bond of a crystal structure ab-
sorbs a photon with sufﬁcient energy, it will jump out of the
bond and brieﬂy become a free electron. When illuminated
by a sufﬁciently intense source of light (e.g., a laser), even
p-type material will have a large number of free electrons
due to photon absorption. Illuminating an n-channel MOS-
FET with light of the appropriate frequency and intensity to
penetrate the gate and oxide insulator can induce a channel
of electron majority charge carriers between the source and
drain, causing the device to conduct regardless of the charge
on the gate.
Thus, a clever adversary may use a well-aimed laser with
the proper intensity to affect the switching behavior of n-
channel MOSFETs in the target device.

mind, we concentrate our efforts on the lower OR gate in
Figure 6.
Figure 7 gives the transistor-level schematic for the target
OR gate. The left four transistors constitute a CMOS NOR
gate, while the two rightmost transistors form a CMOS in-
verter. The target transistor, the n-channel MOSFET indi-
cated in Figure 7, is the last transistor of the NOR half of
the circuit. If it were to conduct, it would cause the out-
put voltage of the NOR half to drop sufﬁciently to cause the
output of the inverter half (and hence the whole OR gate) to
go high.
By illuminating this transistor with a ﬂash of light of
the appropriate frequency and intensity, we may cause it
to brieﬂy drop the voltage of the line going into the inverter
half of the circuit, thus creating a brief high-voltage spike
from the output of the OR gate to the second input of the C-
element (see Figure 6), ultimately causing the target circuit
to output 1.
A.3 An optically induced fault in CMOS
A.4 Practical considerations
How does the induction of faults in the transistors af-
fect the digital logic gates realized by these transistors? We
consider the case of CMOS, one of the most common digi-
tal logic families. CMOS uses electric potential to indicate
logic values: typically, positive voltage represents a logical
1 and 0V represents a logical 0.
Skorobogatov and Anderson have successfully used light
to set the value of bits in SRAM memory (memory based
on CMOS digital logic) [1]. For our example, however, we
would like to use the same technique to inﬂuence the output
of the circuit depicted in Figure 6.
In Figure 6, only one of the inputs to the C-element is
1, so the C-element has a 0 output. Suppose we wish to
change that output to a steady 1. All that we really need to
do is cause the lower OR gate driving the second input of
the C-element to go from 0 to 1, even if only for a short time
(once the C-element has a 1 output, it will not drop back to
a 0 output until both of its inputs drop to 0). With that in
In order to optically ﬂip bits of SRAM, Skorobogatov
and Anderson had to depackage (expose) the digital logic
in the target device, an older MicroChip PIC16F84, sufﬁ-
ciently for their light to be able to affect the transistors [1].
It would probably be signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult to accom-
plish the same thing in the logic (rather than RAM) part of
a more modern (especially multilayered) design. Further-
more, in a dual-rail design that incorporated phototransistor
tripwires as suggested by Skorobogatov and Anderson [1],
depackaging could cause the circuit to always halt in the
alarm state unless the adversary is able to circumvent this
countermeasure.
Our example in the previous section demonstrates some-
thing close to our transient clear fault model, but it is not
obvious whether the other fault models, the steady and ﬂip
varieties, are applicable to CMOS. On the other hand, a de-
sign that is secure in all of our fault models would be safe
against single faults in a CMOS implementation.
