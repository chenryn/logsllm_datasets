User: I just ran an update on ArchLinux which gave me Python3 and Python2.7.
Before this update, I was using Python2.6. The modules I have installed reside in /usr/lib/python2.6/site-package. I now want to use Python2.7 and remove Python2.6.
How can I move my Python2.6 modules into Python2.7 ?
Is it as simple as doing mv /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/* /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages ?
Assistant: Not a complete answer: It is not as simple as a mv. The files are byte compiled into .pyc files which are specific to python versions. So at the very least you'd have to regenerate the .pyc files. (Removing them should be sufficient, too.) Regenerating can be done using compileall.py.
Most distributions offer a saner way to upgrade Python modules than manual fiddling like this, so maybe someone can else can give the Arch specific part of the answer?
