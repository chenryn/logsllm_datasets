Angular 1.x could read an ISO 8601 date from a JSON string and correctly
format it with the date filter. For example: releaseDate:
"2001-12-19T00:00:00" could be formatted using: {{ movie.releaseDate | date}}
The Angular 2 date pipe throws an exception: "Invalid argument
'2001-12-19T00:00:00' for pipe 'function DatePipe() "
It would be much more user-friendly for the developer if a date from a JSON
string could be formatted with the date pipe without first having to transform
the string into a JavaScript date.
