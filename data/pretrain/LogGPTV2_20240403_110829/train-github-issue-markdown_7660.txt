In language-javascript/snippets, there's an "f" snippet for an anonymous
function, and language-todo/snippets has "fix" for a "fix me" comment. To see
this:
  1. Open a javascript file
  2. Type "f"
The former should be offered as the first suggestion, as it's the best match,
but instead it appears 6th on the list, behind fix, for, forin, forof and fun.
