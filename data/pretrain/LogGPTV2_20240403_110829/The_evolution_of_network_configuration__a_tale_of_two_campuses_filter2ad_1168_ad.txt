### GT Network Firewall Management and Configuration

In the GT network, close-to-border firewalls are backed up and committed to the CVS every six hours. In contrast, unit firewalls, which are deployed closer to the edge, do not receive such intensive management. This discrepancy is likely due to the higher reliability requirements for border firewalls. A failure or misconfiguration in a border firewall can have catastrophic consequences for the entire network.

### Distinct Practices in UW Network

The UW network employs distinct practices using `sec` stanzas, as shown in Figure 9b. An inspection of the actual commands reveals that operators are disabling failover for both internal and external interfaces. This prevents virtual firewalls from failing over when the interfaces or connected devices are taken down. These anomalies are primarily observed in firewalls used by the campus IT department.

### Summary of Firewall Configuration and Usage Patterns

Both campus networks exhibit similar configuration change and usage patterns for firewalls. The majority of changes occur at the border firewalls, where changes on virtual firewalls are aggregated. Border firewalls are managed more intensively compared to simple unit firewalls at the edge.

### Longitudinal Analysis

Figure 10 provides a longitudinal view of firewall configuration evolution over five years. The number of lines for ACL (Access Control List) commands has increased sharply. For the GT network, there was a sixfold increase. In the case of the UW network, firewalls were deployed starting in January 2006, with around 260 firewalls added through April 2010.

Figures 10b and 10e illustrate how the configuration of a typical firewall evolves over time. A small spike in the GT network around July 2007 is attributed to the addition of new firewall machines and the migration of a substantial amount of ACLs to these new firewalls. The old ACL configurations were removed several days after the migration. A slight increase in QoS (Quality of Service) commands occurred around July 2008, with a global policy map defining default inspection ports and SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) ports being inserted into approximately 40 firewalls. This policy map enforces further inspection on specified services.

In the UW network (Figure 10e), a similar increase in QoS commands was observed around January 2008. These define two class maps: one for SIP ports, as in the GT network, and another for a specific list of management services, including DNS, rsh, and SunRPC.

The decrease in `mgt` commands around January 2008 in the UW network is due to the removal of "pdm" (PIX Device Manager) commands from all firewalls. This command allowed the device to determine who would have access to the management GUI. Removing these commands prevented access to the GUI and required departments to submit all changes to the campus IT team, reflecting a new campus-wide security policy instituted in 2008.

As with routers, we observe that various network-wide factors, such as infrastructure expansion, policy changes, and the addition or modification of features, contribute to the evolution of firewall configurations.

### Correlation Analysis

Correlation analysis on firewall devices has not revealed any specific correlated change behavior in stanzas, as most changes are made solely to ACL stanzas. The high-level functionality abstraction employed in this paper may be too broad for correlation analysis on firewalls. However, we do observe many correlated changes within the ACL commands. Specifically, changes in the network object group definition (where operators can combine multiple IP addresses, ports, and subnets into separate groups) often lead to changes in the actual access control lists that reference those groups. A more fine-grained classification of commands within the ACL stanza could reveal interesting correlated change behaviors. Exploring correlated changes within access control lists would be a promising direction for future work.

### Switches

In this section, we analyze changes in switch configurations. We find:
1. Interface definitions and related subcommands dominate the changes in switches (Figures 11c and 11d).
2. There are extensive correlated changes (Table 7).

### Snapshot and Change Analysis

Many changes involve management, layer 1, layer 2, and VLAN commands. Figures 11a and 11b show that these lines constitute a majority of any given switch configuration snapshot. Layer 1 and VLAN changes often occur together naturally. Layer 2 changes are expected as switches provide layer 2 connectivity. The significant number of changes in management commands is noteworthy. Most management changes in switch devices are related to SNMP trap and logging commands. SNMP traps send events to the SNMP server under specific conditions, while logging configures the logging behavior for the interface. The default practice in the UW network is to define SNMP trap and logging commands along with port configurations, leading to a large number of management and layer 1 changes.

Certain practices shape how switch configurations evolve. The GT network experiences many additions, while the UW network sees many modifications. In the GT network, most changes are due to additions in layer 1 and VLAN, followed by management and layer 2 commands. In the UW network, there are many modifications, with changes in management and layer 1, followed by VLAN, dominating the changes. This behavior suggests that UW network operators have decided to uniformly enable or disable some functions on ports across most of their switches.

Specialized switch devices can be identified by their distinct characteristics.
