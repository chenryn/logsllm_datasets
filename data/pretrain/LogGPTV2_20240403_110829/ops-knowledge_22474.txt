User: I am working on a django project on two separate systems, Debian Jessie and Mac El Capitan. The project is hosted on github where both systems will pull from or push to.
However, I noticed that on my Debian, when I run python --version, it gives me Python 3.4.2 but on my Mac, it gives me Python 2.7.10 despite being in the same virtual environment. Moreover, when I run django-admin --version on my Debian, it gives me 1.10 while on my Mac, 1.8.3.
This happens even when I freshly clone the projects from github and run the commands.
Why is it that the virtual environment does not keep the same version of python and django?
Assistant: Thanks to @Oliver and @Daniel's comments that lead me to the answer why it did not work.
I started the virtual environment on my Debian with python 3. virtualenv made the virtual environment but it was specifically for Debian.
When I used it for mac, since it could not run the python executable in the virtual environment (since it is only compatible with Debian), hence, it used my Mac's system python, which is Python 2.7.10.
In summary, as virtualenv uses the python executable on the system, when the python executable is run on another system, it will not work.
