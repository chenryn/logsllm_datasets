## Abstract
Estimating network distance between arbitrary Internet endpoints is crucial for various applications, including performance optimization, network debugging, and auditing. Previous methods have leveraged DNS infrastructure, but the widespread use of DNS hosting has made these techniques less reliable. In this paper, we introduce Fury Route, a system that uses the heterogeneous infrastructure of different Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and the proliferation of the EDNS0 client-subnet extension (ECS) to estimate network distances without deploying new infrastructure. Fury Route constructs a virtual path between endpoints via intermediate CDN replicas, requiring no additional infrastructure or cooperation from the measured endpoints. We evaluate Fury Route using data from PlanetLab and RIPE Atlas, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing relative network distances and its low overhead.

## 1. Introduction
The ability to estimate network distance between arbitrary Internet endpoints is essential for many applications [16]. These estimates are strongly correlated with actual end-to-end performance metrics such as throughput and delay [23, 30].

In 2003, Gummadi et al. introduced King [16], which utilized DNS infrastructure to measure network distance without direct access to the endpoints. However, the Internet landscape has changed significantly since then. The number of open recursive DNS resolvers has decreased [17], and DNS hosting (outsourcing DNS services to the cloud [1–3, 5–8]) has become more common, making it difficult to assume co-location of endpoints and authoritative DNS servers.

We present Fury Route, a system that estimates network distance between arbitrary Internet endpoints by leveraging the following:
1. The heterogeneous deployment of different CDNs.
2. CDNs' common practice of directing clients to nearby replicas.
3. The widespread adoption of the EDNS0 client-subnet extension (ECS) [12], which allows a host issuing DNS requests to indicate the origin of the request.

Fury Route constructs a virtual path between source and destination endpoints, consisting of CDN replicas from different providers, by issuing ECS requests on behalf of the endpoints and intermediate CDN replicas. This constructed path length correlates with the latency between the two endpoints.

Fury Route requires no additional infrastructure and does not need the measured endpoints to cooperate by sending or responding to probes. It generates no load on the involved parties, as it only queries DNS, whose infrastructure is designed to handle large loads. Fury Route is not affected by the availability of recursive DNS resolvers or DNS hosting, as it utilizes the mapping work done by CDNs and extracts this information via DNS.

We evaluate Fury Route using ground truth data from PlanetLab and RIPE Atlas, testing from around 9000 nodes distributed across countries and networks. Our results show that Fury Route can construct chains between more than 80% of origin-destination pairs, outperforming other systems like King [16] and iPlane [19]. Fury Route also demonstrates comparable accuracy to iPlane, correctly ordering up to 83% of destinations. Additionally, our graph caching technique reduces DNS queries by 80%.

## 2. Background and Measurement
### 2.1. EDNS0 Client-Subnet Extension (ECS)
The EDNS0 client-subnet extension (ECS) allows a host issuing DNS requests to label their requests with a subnet, indicating the origin of the request. This extension aids in DNS-based replica selection and addresses challenges arising from clients being far from their local DNS (LDNS) server [12, 22].

Upon receiving an ECS request, the authoritative DNS server uses the submitted subnet to perform replica selection according to its policy. The response includes a scope netmask field. If this value is less than or equal to the client-specified subnet length, it indicates the set of subnets that would receive the same result for caching purposes. If the value is greater, it indicates the DNS server wants the client to resubmit with a more specific subnet.

### 2.2. Provider Granularity
We examine the behavior of specific CDNs known to support EDNS [9, 10, 28] and a set of providers collected via manual inspection from the Alexa Top500. Table 1 lists the selected providers and the corresponding hostnames used to query each provider.

| Hostname | Provider |
|----------|----------|
| www.google.com | Google |
| gp1.wac.v2cdn.net | Edgecast |
| img.alicdn.com | Alibaba |
| st.deviantart.net | CloudFront |
| 922977808.r.cdn77.net | CDN77 |
| cdnw.cdnplanet.com.cdngc.net | CDNetworks |
| ib.adnxs.com | ADNXS |

We query each provider's domain name using 25 distinct globally distributed prefixes from PlanetLab as the client subnet. Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the response scopes for each provider. Providers fall into two categories: coarse-grained (e.g., CloudFront, CDNetworks, Google) and fine-grained (e.g., Alibaba, ADNXS, Edgecast). Some providers, like CDN77, return a mix of broad and narrow scopes.

## 3. Fury Route
Fury Route estimates network distance by constructing a path of CDN replicas between two hosts. These replicas are returned as responses to ECS queries, and the paths are generated by an iterative series of ECS queries that "hop" between CDN replicas by issuing new requests on behalf of a CDN replica with the client-subnet extension.

### 3.1. Chain Building
Fury Route consists of three main components:
1. **Chain Building Mechanism:** Connects an origin host with a destination host via a sequence of CDN replicas discovered via EDNS-enabled DNS responses.
2. **Voting System:** Enables the chain-building system to make forward progress in the space of CDN hosts.
3. **Comparison Module:** Compares the lengths of the chains and estimates the relative distance between two points of interest, maximizing the information available from the CDN-based DNS responses.

Figure 2 illustrates the chain building procedure. The dashed circle indicates hosts in the target set, while dotted circles show hosts in a scan of all providers.

### 3.2. Evaluation
We evaluate Fury Route using ground truth data from PlanetLab and RIPE Atlas, testing from around 9000 nodes distributed across countries and networks. Our results show that Fury Route can construct chains between more than 80% of origin-destination pairs, outperforming other systems like King [16] and iPlane [19]. Fury Route also demonstrates comparable accuracy to iPlane, correctly ordering up to 83% of destinations. Additionally, our graph caching technique reduces DNS queries by 80%.

## Conclusion
Fury Route is a novel system that leverages the heterogeneous infrastructure of CDNs and the EDNS0 client-subnet extension to estimate network distances without deploying new infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that Fury Route is effective in revealing relative network distances and has low overhead, making it a practical solution for various applications.
