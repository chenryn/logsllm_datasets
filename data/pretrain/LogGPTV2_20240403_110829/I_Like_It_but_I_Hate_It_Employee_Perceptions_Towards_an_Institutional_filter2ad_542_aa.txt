ABSTRACT
The continued acceptance of enhanced security technologies in
the private sector, such as two-factor authentication, has prompted
significant changes of organizational security practices. While past
work has focused on understanding how users in consumer set-
tings react to enhanced security measures for banking, email, and
more, little work has been done to explore how these technological
transitions and applications occur within organizational settings.
Moreover, while many corporations have invested significantly to
secure their networks for the sake of protecting valuable intellec-
tual property, academic institutions, which also create troves of
intellectual property, have fallen behind in this endeavor.
In this paper, we detail a transition from a token-based, two-
factor authentication system within an academic institution to an
entirely digital system utilizing employee-owned mobile devices.
To accomplish this, we first conducted discussions with staff from
the Information Security Office to understand the administrative
perspective of the transition. Second, our key contribution is the
analysis of an in-depth survey to explore the perceived benefits and
usability of the novel technological requirements from the employee
perspective. In particular, we investigate the implications of the new
authentication system based on employee acceptance or opposition
to the mandated technological transition, with a specific focus on
the utilization of personal devices for workplace authentication.

1 INTRODUCTION
Two-factor authentication technologies are no longer novel. Many
of these tools originally existed for both the corporate and private
sector in the form of smartcards, or physical tokens. What initially
began in the consumer sector as a tool to further secure banking
(e.g., [3, 33, 61]), and in the corporate sectors as a means to secure
data [36, 41, 54], two-factor authentication now penetrates many
markets including email, ecommerce, and cloud storage, among
others. Often met with begrudging acceptance when introduced
[10], these physical technologies have dominated the second-factor
authentication market for years.

More recently, researchers and technologists took note of the
mobile phone boom, and began to transition these physical au-
thentication technologies into the digital realm, thus birthing au-
thenticator apps [4, 29]. Now that technologies such as Google
and Microsoft Authenticators exist, large-scale companies have
begun adopting them, as they eliminate the need to carry a (now
redundant) physical authentication token. In concert with this shift
towards mobile authentication, many companies have begun a tran-
sition towards technical systems based on Bring Your Own Device
(BYOD) [5, 9, 13, 26, 38]. In a standard BYOD system, employees of
an organization are expected to provide their own equipment, rang-
ing from smartphones to laptops, and use it to complete their work.
While employees may enjoy this ability to use their own devices
for work purposes, this trend often actually costs companies more
money than if they had purchased devices for their employees [53].
It also often creates security and compliance concerns for corporate
policy managers [35, 42].
While a number of published works on 2FA and BYOD exist
in the context of personal and corporate technology development,
very few researchers have focused on the adoption of (and tran-
sition towards) these technologies in the corporate or academic
sector. Although not as nationally publicized, academic institutions
have increasingly become desirable targets of attackers, with ma-
jor universities such as Michigan State, Butler, North Dakota, the
University of Maryland, The Pennsylvania State University (mul-
tiple times), UC Berkeley, and many more, suffering major data
breaches over the past three years [21, 28, 31, 34, 37, 40, 49, 56]. In
the case of Michigan State, a data breach resulted in the theft of
a database containing full names, access IDs, dates of birth, and
social security numbers for a large number of current and previous
students and employees. Despite there not being any password
information in this database, 449 individual user accounts were
eventually compromised as a result of this breach [40]. One of
Penn State’s data breaches involved the theft of 18,000 user names
and passwords, though it was unclear from the public reports how
many of these accounts were accessed by the attackers [49]. These
data breaches provide further evidence of the shortcomings of the
so-called standard duality of a user name and password.
Academic institutions, unlike many large-scale corporations, are
also often slower to react to data breaches, and likely also more
vulnerable to data breaches in the first place, mostly attributed to
the historically-grounded openness and collaborative environment
between faculty, staff, researchers and students, as well as the fact
that faculty and researchers generally have more control over their
data than employees do within corporate institutions [51, 58]. Due
to the aforementioned attributes of academic environments, secur-
ing an academic institution from cyber-attacks becomes not only a
technical obstacle, but also a social challenge, with a great emphasis
needed on the acceptability of advanced security technologies from
the perspective of the stakeholders within these institutions.
Despite there being a diverse literature base on the development
of two-factor authentication technologies, as well as coverage of
technology perception from a private user level, there has been no
work, as far as we know, exploring the design, implementation, and
reaction of employees within a large academic (or even corporate)
institution which adopts a mobile two-factor authentication system
utilizing a BYOD framework. In this paper, we seek to fill this litera-
ture gap by conducting a study designed to thoroughly understand
the rollout of a complex two-factor authentication system utilizing
employee’s devices. To accomplish this, we worked with the Office
of Information Security at the Pennsylvania State University to
understand how and why system design choices were planned, as
well as how they were implemented. This component of the study
was accomplished through a series of discussions with the Assistant
Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).
Based on existing literature and the conducted background dis-
cussions, we then developed, distributed and analyzed an online
survey within the academic organization, which explores concepts
of security enhancements, privacy considerations, and usability
evaluations of the combined second-factor, BYOD system utilizing
a mobile app, DuoMobile. Comparative usability was measured
between a previously used token-based two-factor authentication
system, as well as the DuoMobile system, with standardized con-
cepts of ease of use, relative advantage, and compatibility. Security
concepts and privacy considerations were explored through items
including password construction, device security, and general secu-
rity practices. Although significant research has been conducted
regarding the construction of new 2FA systems, as well as research
on BYOD concerns, our study is the first that we know of to ex-
amine a transition between two 2FA systems and towards a BYOD
framework. The main outcome of our work is to explore a system
implementation like this from conceptualization to implementation
and attempt to understand factors that encourage or discourage
employee placation or resentment towards the institution that im-
plements such a change. We also seek to explore any undiscovered
issues of BYOD systems, and report on these in a systematic manner
to provide guidance for BYOD policies at other academic institu-
tions.
We proceed as follows. In the next section, we introduce relevant
literature and begin the formation of central themes for the entire
paper. We then discuss our methodology, including our metrics,
participant pool, etc. Results of our study are then introduced. Fol-
lowing this, we enter a qualitative discussion covering our results,
and formulate general takeaways from the research.
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we review prior work on two-factor authentication
system implementations and designs, as well as how these different
systems have been implemented and received across various indus-
try sectors. We then review different literature concerning Bring
Your Own Device (BYOD) implications within corporate spaces,
and discuss both the merits and security risks of such systems.
2.1 Two-Factor Authentication Technologies
From a technological perspective, two-factor authentication tech-
nologies are not a new phenomenon. Originally introduced in its
more modern form in 1994 [32], two-factor authentication has
primarily been implemented with physical tokens, which usually
operate by generating n-digit pins (as shown in Appendix A.1) on
the physical token, which can then be entered into a text field on a
display after a standard user name and password have been entered.
Other authentication methods developed over time have included
utilizing audio calls, as well as SMS and email notifications. More
recently, new approaches for two-factor authentication solutions
have been developed, which are implemented as applications on
mobile phones [4, 63]. Popular examples are Google Authenticator,
Microsoft Authenticator, and, as is relevant to this study, DuoMo-
bile. Previous work has explored various schemas involving each
of these types of authentication methods across multiple technol-
ogy platforms, with no technologically robust, usable configuration
found as of yet to implement an ideal 2FA platform [10].
Originally used by military institutions and corporations, two-
factor authentication entered the consumer market primarily as
a tool for securing online banking and ATM interactions [19, 22].
Recently, with the aforementioned authenticators, two-factor au-
thentication has become more commonplace on diverse consumer
technical systems including banking, email, social networks, and
cloud storage spaces [1, 17, 30]. While multiple two-factor authenti-
cation methods exist, it remains unclear which method is the most
suitable depending on the context and environment [11, 16].
Despite the growing number of services that encourage (or at
least permit) second-factor authentication, as well as the larger
number of tools to accomplish this security enhancement, two-
factor authentication has yet to make a major dent in the consumer
marketplace, with only about 6% percent of consumers adopting
such technologies [48]. As more institutions implement two-factor
authentication utilizing mobile devices and phase out physical to-
kens, it is conceivable that consumers will adopt such technologies
in other contexts, in particular, if they perceive the technology
usable and secure.
While there is a robust body of literature concerning two-factor
authentication technologies and their effects on factors such as
usability and productivity [16, 27, 59, 64, 65], there is less work con-
cerned with the introduction and adoption (consequences) of these
security mechanisms in practice, especially within an institutional
setting. Some previous work has focused on the introduction and
adoption of new 2FA technologies in the private banking sector
with customers [33], in which a wide range of usability issues were
presented. These included issues such as differing authentication
methods across different platforms, or the existence of too many
authentication steps. One of the major takeaways of this study was
the participant-driven discussion of the, then conceptual, integra-
tion of 2FA technologies into mobile phones via SMS (this has now
come to pass).
Much of the existing literature focuses on user perception of
incorporating two-factor technologies into their workflow, often
stating that such technologies interrupt normal operating behaviors
in a workspace, unless special considerations are given to usability
concerns [3, 12, 22]. More recently, conceptual research has been
conducted to construct optimal two-factor authentication systems,
primarily utilizing mobile devices [39] in terms of system feasibility,
and projected usability. In such a system, pre-existing password in-
terfaces are left intact, with the second factor taking place through
a third-party service. The ability to maintain these legacy struc-
tures allows for rapid deployment of these second factor systems,
without the need to entirely re-develop a system backend. Systems
built upon this concept have been deployed at several major banks
[39], as well as the Pennsylvania State University. This recent 2FA
development has seen a great deal of conceptual discussion, but
limited work involving implementation; something our study seeks
to expand upon via a large-scale institutional setting.
2.2 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
As previously mentioned, one recently introduced second-factor
authentication approach has been authenticator apps on mobile
phones. This has become especially critical for corporations as
BYOD implementations have become more widespread [7]. More
broadly recognized in the early 2000s, the primary motivation of
BYOD is to enable employees of a company to complete their work
in an environment that is desirable to them [62], and has become
popular as more employees prefer to utilize a device that is inher-
ently personal to them for purposes of work and play [47]. This
employee preference has links to various other constructs including
personal device self-efficacy (i.e., individuals’ beliefs in their ability
to complete tasks using their own device) [6, 24], job autonomy (i.e.,
employees’ sense of having a choice in initiating and regulating
their work tasks) [23], and device familiarity (i.e., time spent with
the device) [66], among others [20].
One of the primary concerns surrounding BYOD within corpo-
rate networks is the fact that securing these personal devices is a
challenge, and a potential liability to the network owner and any-
one else on that network. Concrete threats involving these devices
include device theft (and thus, data loss) and malware entering
the network through an unsecured device [26, 38, 45]. Other con-
cerns include feelings of resentment towards companies, from the
perspective of the user, as security policies enacted by companies
may restrict certain functions of a phone, or enable features such as
company-initiated “remote wipe” that users may not want [35]. The
challenge of BYOD-based systems is to balance employee desires (to
use their own device for work-related tasks) and usability concerns
(well-designed security mechanisms), as well as continue to provide
a level of reasonable security to the corporate network these devices
connect to. It is this particular balance that is of interest to us for
this study, as the new system introduced at the observed university
is designed, in principle, to be an entirely BYOD-based 2FA sys-
tem, utilizing a second-factor authenticator app installed on these
employee-owned devices. In essence, we are studying a system that
potentially introduces risks to a network, while simultaneously
contributing to security via second-factor authentication.
2.3 2FA Transition Plan
To appropriately frame our study, we worked with the newly minted
Office of Information Security at the Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity. Through a series of discussions with the Assistant CISO, we
captured motivations for system design and reasoning, with an
emphasis on usability and needs to secure the university network.
Further conversations focused on deployment procedures that the
Office of Information Security crafted, with thorough explanations
of deployment rationale. This deployment procedure is discussed in
Section 2.4. These meetings took place over a six-month period at
critical junctures in the deployment of the new system. For the sake
of grounding the reader, we will now detail the configuration of
this second-factor authentication system, and contrast it with the
previous system as based on discussions with the Assistant CISO.
The original 2FA system at the studied institution was based on
the Vasco Digipass Go 6 token [55], which would generate an AES-
based code [46] every 60 seconds. An example of this token can be
seen in Appendix A.1. When logging in to a system which required
authentication, users would be required to provide their standard
login credentials, and upon acceptance, enter the generated number
from the token to access the desired system.
