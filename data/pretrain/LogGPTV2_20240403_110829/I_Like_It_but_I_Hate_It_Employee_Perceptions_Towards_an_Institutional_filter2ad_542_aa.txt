**Abstract:**
The increasing adoption of enhanced security technologies, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), has led to significant changes in organizational security practices. While previous research has focused on user reactions to 2FA in consumer settings like banking and email, little attention has been given to the implementation and acceptance of these technologies within organizational contexts. This is particularly true for academic institutions, which, despite creating substantial intellectual property, often lag behind in adopting advanced security measures.

In this paper, we examine the transition from a token-based 2FA system to a digital 2FA system using employee-owned mobile devices at an academic institution. Our study involves discussions with the Information Security Office to understand the administrative perspective and an in-depth survey to explore employee perceptions of the new system's benefits and usability. We specifically investigate the implications of the new authentication system based on employee acceptance or opposition, with a focus on the use of personal devices for workplace authentication.

**1. Introduction**
Two-factor authentication (2FA) technologies have evolved from physical tokens and smartcards to digital solutions, such as authenticator apps. Initially introduced in the corporate and private sectors to secure banking and data, 2FA has now expanded to various markets, including email, e-commerce, and cloud storage. Despite their widespread use, physical 2FA technologies have often met with reluctant acceptance due to their inconvenience.

Recently, the rise of mobile phones has led to the development of digital 2FA solutions, such as Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator. These apps eliminate the need for physical tokens, making them more convenient for large-scale companies. Concurrently, many organizations have adopted Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies, where employees use their personal devices for work. While BYOD can increase employee satisfaction, it also introduces security and compliance concerns, and often results in higher costs for companies.

Despite the extensive literature on 2FA and BYOD, there is a lack of research on the adoption and transition to these technologies in academic and corporate settings. Academic institutions, which are increasingly targeted by cyber-attacks, often face unique challenges in implementing advanced security measures due to their open and collaborative environments. To address this gap, our study investigates the design, implementation, and employee reactions to a new 2FA system using a BYOD framework at a large academic institution.

**2. Background and Related Work**
**2.1 Two-Factor Authentication Technologies**
Two-factor authentication (2FA) has been in use since the mid-1990s, primarily through physical tokens that generate one-time passwords. Over time, other methods such as audio calls, SMS, and email notifications have been developed. More recently, mobile authenticator apps have become popular, offering a more convenient and secure alternative to physical tokens.

Initially used by military and corporate entities, 2FA entered the consumer market to secure online banking and ATM transactions. Today, 2FA is widely used across various consumer platforms, including social networks and cloud storage. However, the most suitable 2FA method remains context-dependent, and adoption rates in the consumer market remain low, with only about 6% of consumers using 2FA.

Research on 2FA has primarily focused on its impact on usability and productivity, with less attention given to the practical introduction and adoption of these technologies in institutional settings. Some studies have explored the adoption of 2FA in the private banking sector, highlighting usability issues and the need for seamless integration into existing workflows.

**2.2 Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**
BYOD policies allow employees to use their personal devices for work, enhancing job autonomy and device familiarity. However, BYOD also introduces security risks, such as device theft and malware, and can lead to employee resentment if company security policies restrict device functionality. Balancing employee preferences and network security is a key challenge in BYOD implementations.

**2.3 2FA Transition Plan**
To understand the transition to the new 2FA system, we collaborated with the Office of Information Security at the Pennsylvania State University. Through discussions with the Assistant Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), we gathered insights into the motivations, design, and deployment procedures of the new system. The original 2FA system used Vasco Digipass Go 6 tokens, which generated AES-based codes every 60 seconds. The new system, DuoMobile, is a mobile app that provides a more convenient and secure 2FA solution.

**2.4 Implementation of DuoMobile App**
[This section will detail the specific implementation of the DuoMobile app, including the configuration, deployment process, and any technical or operational considerations.]

**Methodology, Results, and Discussion**
[Subsequent sections will cover the methodology, results, and discussion of the study, providing a comprehensive analysis of the transition to the new 2FA system and its impact on employees.]
