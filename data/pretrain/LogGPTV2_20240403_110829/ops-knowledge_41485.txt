User: How to deploy web applications based on Docker containerization technology? Please provide a detailed description of the process.
Assistant: Based on Docker's containerization technology, the process of deploying web applications is as follows: 1. Prepare Docker image: make the web application into a Docker image, including program files, library files, operating environment, etc., and the configuration of the application also needs to be modified ( Such as modifying the database connection, port number, etc.). 2. Run the container in Docker: use the docker run command to start the container, and specify the name of the container, mapped port, mounted data volume, etc. in the command. For example, to run a container named webapp and map host port 8080 to container port 80: ``` docker run --name webapp -p 8080:80 -v /data/webapp:/var/www/html - d webapp:latest ``` 3. Verify the web application: access port 8080 of the host through a browser to check whether the web application can be accessed normally. 4. Logs and monitoring: use the docker logs command to obtain the running logs of the container and check whether there is any abnormality. Use the docker stats command to monitor the resource usage of the container. 5. Update the web application: When you need to update the web application, you only need to re-create the Docker image and run the container. If data needs to be preserved, the data volume can be mounted into a new container. Summary: Through Docker containerization technology, we can package web applications into independent containers and deploy them in different environments. This method can improve the portability and scalability of the application program, and can also reduce the cost of system operation and maintenance.
