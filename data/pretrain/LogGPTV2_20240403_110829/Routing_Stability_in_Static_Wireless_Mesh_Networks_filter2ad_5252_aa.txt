## Abstract
Significant research has been dedicated to the design of routing protocols for wireless mesh networks. However, there is limited understanding of the stability of routes in such networks. This knowledge is crucial for designing effective routing protocols and for network planning and management. In this paper, we present a measurement-based characterization of routing stability in two static wireless mesh networks: the UCSB MeshNet and the MIT Roofnet. Using detailed link quality data collected over several days, we analyze route-level characteristics such as prevalence, persistence, and flapping. Our key findings are that wireless routes are often dominated by a single route, but these dominant routes are short-lived due to frequent flapping. We also show that simple stabilization techniques, such as hysteresis thresholds, can significantly improve route persistence.

## 1. Introduction
Applications like last-mile Internet delivery, public safety, and distributed sensing are driving the deployment of large-scale multi-hop wireless networks, or mesh networks. Although the wireless routers in these networks are typically stationary, the routes themselves are expected to be unstable. This instability arises from the variability in wireless link quality due to multipath fading, external interference, and weather conditions. These fluctuations can lead to variations in the quality of mesh routes, resulting in route flapping, a type of instability unique to wireless networks.

Current routing protocols often do not consider routing stability during the selection of routes. Many protocols [6, 14] ignore the fact that a route initially discovered may become sub-optimal over time. Route rediscovery is typically triggered only by route breaks and timeouts, which can negatively impact network performance.

Other protocols [2, 7] periodically re-evaluate the quality of a route based on the exchange rate of control messages. This approach fails to adapt to rapid changes in route quality, leading to routing pathologies such as packet reordering [3], which can severely degrade network performance.

A detailed investigation of routing stability can help in designing protocols that balance performance and stability. Additionally, understanding routing stability is important for network management tasks, such as channel assignment in multi-radio mesh networks [15, 16]. It also aids in network planning, such as router placement and radio configuration.

This paper presents the first measurement-based characterization of routing stability in static wireless mesh networks. We address questions such as: (1) Is there a clear choice of an optimal route between a source-destination pair? (2) How long do such routes persist before a change occurs? (3) What benefits do route flaps provide? and (4) What measures can reduce route flaps?

## 2. Related Work
Several studies have analyzed routing stability in wireline networks. Paxson [17] reported on routing loops, stability, and symmetry using traceroute data, finding that Internet paths are typically dominated by a single route, with most routes persisting for days or weeks. Labovitz et al. [13] investigated Internet routing stability using BGP messages, while Govindan et al. [9] studied the growth of the Internet and found that route availability had degraded. Recent attention has focused on routing pathologies due to BGP configuration faults [8, 18].

In the domain of wireless networks, various routing protocols [2, 6, 14] have been proposed for multi-hop wireless networks. While these efforts have extensively studied route discovery, there is no formal study of routing stability. Studies on mobile ad hoc networks have investigated route lifetimes, but node mobility influences route stability. Our focus is on static mesh networks, where stability is influenced by network topology and link quality variations.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Network Deployments
The UCSB MeshNet is a 20-node multi-radio 802.11a/b network deployed indoors across five floors of an office building on the UCSB campus. Each node is equipped with two types of PCMCIA radios: a Winstron Atheros-chipset 802.11a radio and a Senao Prism2-chipset 802.11b radio. The 802.11b and 802.11a radios use auto-rate feedback [10] and SampleRate [2] for rate adaptation, respectively. There are 802.11b access points operating on various channels, with no external interference in the 802.11a band.

The MIT Roofnet consists of 22 nodes spread over four square kilometers in Cambridge, MA. Each node is a PC with a Prism2-chipset 802.11b radio and an omni-directional antenna. All radios operate on the same 802.11b channel and experience interference from non-Roofnet access points.

### 3.2 Link Quality Estimation
Link quality is measured using the Expected Transmission Time (ETT) metric [7], which estimates the total time to transmit a packet on a link. ETT is calculated from the link's loss rate and data rate. In the MeshNet, link quality information was collected over three different days using broadcast probes and packet pair probing. In the Roofnet, link delivery ratios are available on a per-minute basis for each 802.11b data rate, and ETT is set to the lowest data rate.

### 3.3 Route Computation
We compute routes between all source-destination pairs for each minute using Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm, with the Weighted Cumulative Expected Transmission Time (WCETT) metric [7]. WCETT estimates the time a packet will take to traverse a route, considering data rates, reliabilities, and channel assignments. For the Roofnet, all radios operated on a common channel, so channel diversification did not play a role. A total of 6,345 and 11,470 unique routes were observed for the MeshNet and the Roofnet, respectively.

### 3.4 Shortcomings
Our analysis does not explicitly account for the impact of network load and external networks on link quality measurements. The MeshNet had no data traffic during the collection period, but the Roofnet was operational. Both networks experienced interference on the 802.11b band. Future work will address the impact of these factors. Additionally, our analysis does not differentiate routing behavior based on time-of-day patterns, and the configuration of radios, such as transmission power and receive sensitivity, may influence routing stability. Software-defined radios could help address these limitations.

## 4. Stability Analysis
We use three stability metrics: prevalence (the probability of observing a given route), persistence (the duration for which a route lasts before a change), and route flapping (a change in route).

### 4.1 Route Prevalence and Persistence
For a given source-destination pair, the dominant route is the one observed most frequently. The prevalence \( p_d \) of the dominant route is calculated as \( p_d = \frac{k_p}{n_p} \), where \( n_p \) is the total number of times any route was available, and \( k_p \) is the number of times the dominant route was observed.

Figure 1 shows the cumulative distribution of the prevalence of the dominant route for all source-destination pairs in the MeshNet and Roofnet. The median prevalence on the MeshNet and Roofnet are 65% and 57%, respectively, indicating that routes in static mesh networks are weakly dominated by a single route.

Next, we analyze the persistence of the dominant routes. Figure 2 plots the cumulative distribution of persistence values in minutes. The median persistence value for the MeshNet is 9.6 minutes, and for the Roofnet, it is 3.2 minutes, suggesting that routes in static mesh networks are short-lived.

Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution of the number of unique routes for all source-destination pairs. The MeshNet offers 7 unique routes for the median node pair, while the Roofnet offers 17. The higher number of available routes in the Roofnet explains the lower prevalence and persistence values compared to the MeshNet.

One plausible explanation for the higher number of available routes in the Roofnet is the difference in network design. The Roofnet is an outdoor 802.11b network, while the MeshNet is an indoor 802.11a/b network. Despite being indoor, the MeshNet has fewer unique routes, possibly due to the more controlled environment.

## Conclusion
Our study provides a quantitative characterization of routing stability in static wireless mesh networks. We find that routes are often dominated by a single route, but these routes are short-lived due to frequent flapping. Simple stabilization techniques can significantly improve route persistence. Understanding these dynamics is essential for designing robust routing protocols and managing network resources effectively.
