User: What is the best way to downgrade icu4c from 55.1 to 54.1 on Mac OS X Mavericks.
I tried brew switch icu4c 54.1 and failed.
Reason to switch back to 54.1
I am trying to setup and use Mapnik. 
I was able to install Mapnik from homebrew - brew install mapnik
But, I get the following error when I try to import mapnik in python 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mapnik/__init__.py", line 69, in <module>
    from _mapnik import *
ImportError: dlopen(/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/mapnik/_mapnik.so, 2): Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/libicuuc.54.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/Cellar/mapnik/2.2.0_5/lib/libmapnik.dylib
  Reason: image not found
Python version on my Mac - Python 2.7.5 (default, Mar  9 2014, 22:15:05)
Is switching icu4c back to 54.1 way to go?
Or, Am I missing something?
Thanks for the help in advance.
Assistant: This was Homebrew's fault and should be fixed after brew update && brew upgrade mapnik; sorry!
