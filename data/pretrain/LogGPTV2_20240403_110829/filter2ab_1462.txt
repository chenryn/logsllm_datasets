titleblackhat:us-21 Next-Gen DFIR: Mass Exploits &#38; Supplier Compromise 
There’s been a spike in major incidents and widespread DFIR disasters involving both service providers (such as MSPs and cloud providers) as well as software providers (such as SolarWinds, Microsoft, and Accellion). Responders have little visibility and often find out about vulnerabilities, exploits, and backdoors far too late.   In this fast-paced talk, we'll dissect real “next-gen” DFIR cases and how to adapt your response processes to meet today’s global threats. This will include a walkthrough of a SolarWinds case, including threat intelligence and threat hunting, which were the keys to an effective response. We'll analyze a recent Exchange exploitation case where multiple cybercriminal gangs hacked into the server, both before and after the vulnerability was made public. We'll discuss the FBI's court-approved removal operation and the implications of pre-emptive access by law enforcement to private servers on a mass scale. Finally, we’ll analyze an MSP hacking case, where criminals leveraged the Revil ransomware to hold over 100 clinics hostage.  We are on the precipice of seeing major changes to standard response best practices. All of us need to expand DFIR processes to account for mass 0-day exploits and supplier compromises. This includes strategies for threat intelligence, methods for obtaining early information about a potential incident, obtaining and vetting IoCs, risk evaluation strategies, and more. We also need to integrate threat hunting into response operations and prepare for potential unexpected law enforcement access to systems. Join us and get practical strategies for adapting your DFIR response best practices to reflect today’s increasingly interconnected threat landscape.
