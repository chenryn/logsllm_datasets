• Insider data theft does not  
    create artifacts 
• Can reconstruct activity 
• Criticism: Only provides evidence and  
     indications of data theft, and not  
     concrete proof. 
"When you copy, you break 
that pattern. Because when 
you copy, you don't cherry-
pick, you just get in and get 
out. And that has a uniform 
pattern, which is going to 
look unusual."
