On this page, https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.unimplemented!.html, the
[src] hyperlink points to https://doc.rust-
lang.org/src/std/%3Ccore%20macros%3E.html#1, which does not exist.
The same problem happens on https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format!.html,
which points to https://doc.rust-
lang.org/src/std/%3Ccore_collections%20macros%3E.html#1-2. The filename here
is `.html`, which matches the name that `collections`
is aliased to in libstd below.
I think the problem happens with macros that are reexported from another
crate.
This seems to be a complete list of reexported macros in Rust's standard
library:
src/libstd/lib.rs:
    #[macro_use]
    #[macro_reexport(assert, assert_eq, debug_assert, debug_assert_eq,
        unreachable, unimplemented, write, writeln)]
    extern crate core;
    #[macro_use]
    #[macro_reexport(vec, format)]
    extern crate collections as core_collections;
