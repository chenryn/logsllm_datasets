On the Rust documentation pages for certain macros, such as `unimplemented!` (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.unimplemented!.html) and `format!` (https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format!.html), the `[src]` hyperlinks point to non-existent URLs. Specifically, the link for `unimplemented!` directs to https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/%3Ccore%20macros%3E.html#1, which does not exist. Similarly, the link for `format!` points to https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/%3Ccore_collections%20macros%3E.html#1-2, which also does not exist. The issue appears to be related to macros that are re-exported from other crates.

Here is a list of re-exported macros in Rust's standard library, as defined in `src/libstd/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
#[macro_reexport(assert, assert_eq, debug_assert, debug_assert_eq, unreachable, unimplemented, write, writeln)]
extern crate core;

#[macro_use]
#[macro_reexport(vec, format)]
extern crate collections as core_collections;
```

This suggests that the problem occurs with macros that are re-exported from other crates, such as `core` and `collections`.

To summarize:
- The `[src]` links for re-exported macros in the Rust standard library documentation are broken.
- This issue affects macros like `unimplemented!` and `format!`.
- The re-exported macros are listed in `src/libstd/lib.rs` and include macros from the `core` and `collections` crates.
