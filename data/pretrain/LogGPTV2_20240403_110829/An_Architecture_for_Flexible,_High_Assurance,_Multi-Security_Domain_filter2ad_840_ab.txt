components, 
their  operational  subordinates,  CONUS
based  support  units,  and  any  alliance  network  causes
lack  of  email  between  military  service 
problems. Component commanders (air, ground, and sea)
are  the  people  who  actually  provide  ships,  aircraft,
soldiers, and supplies to any alliance. As such, component
commanders  often  need  to  coordinate  directly  with
alliance headquarters and units. Similarly, CONUS based
support units provide airlift, ground troops, supplies, and
special  units  (e.g.,  civil  affairs  units)  and  need  to
communicate  directly  with  the  alliance.  The  only  way
Component  commanders  or  CONUS  based  units  can
contact  an  alliance  headquarters  or  unit  is  with  secure
telephones,  through  the  1950’s  era  AUTODIN  message
system,  or  by  establishing  their  own  dedicated,  secure
connection with a separate guard.
Operational  units  usually  have  access 
to  secure
telephones and have some type of SIPRNET access, albeit
without  electronic  guards.  This  means  that  sending  long
electronic  messages  (e.g.,  Air  Targeting  Orders  can  be
hundreds of pages long)  from  the  alliance  network  to  an
aircraft carrier’s U.S.-only network is problematic.
The lack of network connectivity shown in Table 2 is
clearly  a  problem  for  U.S.  operational  commanders
working  with  an  alliance.  The  current  solution  is  to
provide  some  alliance  level  computers  where  they  are
needed,  and  to  move  information  from  one  network  to
another via the “sneaker net.” While this works, it is slow,
inefficient, and prone to errors.
One  final  operational  degradation  is  caused  by  the
intermittent  nature  of  most  alliance  networks.  To
understand and exploit any network’s full capability users
need to develop their skills through regular use. The U.S.
and  its  allies  have  standing,  classified,  alliance  networks
in  only  a  few  locations  world-wide.  For  the  rest  of  the
world, alliance networks are temporarily operational only
during  exercises  or  real  world  contingencies,  so  any
lessons learned are generally lost.
The  difficulties  lie  in  solving  these  interoperability
problems  without  compromising  the  security  of  internal
U.S.-only  networks,  or  any  other  country’s  internal
network. The author proposes a solution to these problems
in Section 4.
4. Alliance Network Architecture (ANA)
The  proposed  architecture,  presented  in  Section  4.2,
attempts  to  solve  both  the  email  and  web-browsing
problems  by  combining  asymmetric  encryption  (i.e.,
public key technology) for encrypting individual sessions
and  signing  individual  data  objects,  with  symmetric
encryption  (e.g.,  Virtual  Private  Network  technology)  on
the  transmission  links.  This  arrangement  provides  strong
identification of the user, strong authentication of objects,
and strong encryption the transmissions.
4.1. Requirements for Alliance Networks
for  multi-national 
As  mentioned  earlier,  most  network  research  and
implementation 
networks  was
undertaken  during  the  Cold  War.  Because  of  this,  most
current  alliance  and  coalition  network  research  and
implementation  plans  continue  to  have  an  Euro-centric
approach. This Euro-centric approach assumes all partners
are  peers,  that  network  membership  is  stable,  and  that
anything  threatening  the  alliance  threatens  all  partners.
These  assumptions  are  not  valid  in  all  regions  of  the
world. Table 3 shows the requirements for an Euro-centric
network and compares them with what the author believes
the requirements are m to be.
The  major  difference  between  the  proposed  alliance
network and current coalition networks is that the alliance
network is not necessarily a peer network. While it can be
a  peer  network,  it  does  not  have  to  be  one.  NATO
networks  and  the  proposed  U.S.  Department  of  Defense
Coalition Wide  Area  Network  (CWAN)  assume  network
members  always  belong  to  the  coalition  and  that  every
member  has  the  right  to  access  all  of  the  data  on  the
network. However, there are several geo-political regions
where  this  is  not  practicable,  the  Pacific  is  one  of  these.
The  Pacific  region  has  many  “hot  spots”  and  has  many
potential communities of interest. Military allies may not
be on the same side of every conflict. There are often real-
world  operations  or  crises  happening  at  the  same  time
exercises are taking place and information is not allowed
to  flow  freely  between  exercises  and  real-world—both
because the exercise information may be classified and to
reduce 
real-world  operational
commanders  mistakenly  acting  upon  exercise-only
information.  As a result, alliance  networks  in  the  Pacific
region  must  be  able  to  service  separate  communities  of
interest  simultaneously.  Similar  arguments  can  be  made
for  networks  in  Africa,  South  America,  and  the  Middle
East. As a result, the basic assumption of current coalition
network architectures—a stable  membership of peers—is
invalid for modern alliance networks.

To  enter  the  alliance  network  requires  at  least  five
separate  steps,  these  are  shown  in  Figure  1  on  the  next

the fact that it addresses all the requirements from Section 4.1. The
author requests the reader’s indulgence to not “throw out the baby with
the bath water” and to use this architecture as a framework for discussing
and solving the alliance coalition problem.
through  unclassified  networks  using  military  grade
encryption  on  the  data  portions  of  the  transmission
packets.
The  first  prerequisite  is  that  all  computers  have  a
HPED.  Whether  the  HPED  is  a  Fortezza  card,  an  allied
manufactured equivalent, or something new is immaterial,
as  long  as  it  can  provide  hardware  based  public/private
keys  and  digital  signatures.4  The  next  requirement  is  a
link.5  A  virtual
strongly  encrypted  communications 
private network (VPN) is shown in the Figure 1. To enter
the  enclave,  the  user  first  enables  the  HPED  with  a
password or biometric device. She then begins negotiating
a  trust  relationship  with  the  enclave  guard  through  the
VPN.  The  user  exchanges  digital  certificates  with  the
enclave guard (steps 1 and 2), and uses these to establish a
secret  symmetric  encryption  key  for  bulk  encrypting
transmissions  later  in  the  session.  The  current  methods
and  algorithms  used  for  negotiating  and  encrypting
sessions  on  128-bit  Secure  Socket  Layer  (SSL)  sessions
may  be  acceptable  given  the  packets  are  being  tunneled
through a strongly encrypted VPN.
Once  the  individual  user’s  session  key  is  established
and a bulk encryption session begins inside the VPN, the
user can log into the enclave via the enclave guard with a
userid and password. At this point the user has nominally
4 Some readers may be surprised to find Fortezza cards mentioned here.
Rest assured that these devices are alive and well in the U.S. military,
providing a level of identification and authentication well beyond what
software tokens can provide.

when a DES replacement is chosen.
entered the enclave. This is possible only after providing a
HPED  password 
(or  biometric),  having  a  correct
public/private/digital signature on the HPED, providing a
correct  userid  and  password,  and  being  connected  to  the
enclave through the hardware encrypted VPN link.
Once  past  the  enclave  guard,  the  user  contacts  the
arbitration  server.  The  arbitration  server  decides  what
services  and  machines  a  user  can  access  within  the
enclave. Because the enclave is not a peer network, every

[2,3].
Additionally, every server in the enclave checks both the
user’s  credentials  and  the  authentication  server  issued

Figure 1 – Five Steps for Connecting to the Alliance Network
An additional requirement for the enclave guards is to
prevent  connections  from  one  alliance  partner’s  network
directly to another partner’s network (i.e., no “back doors”
through  the  enclave  guards).  This  is  shown  in  the  figure
with a U.S. user being refused a connection to the foreign
network. This capability to prevent backdoor connections
is required for all partners to trust the system. Note: There
is  only  one  enclave  guard  per  enclave;  two  guards  are
shown in the figure for illustrative purposes only .
Systems similar in many respects to the enclave guards
exist today in several different commercial products [6, 7].
Similarly,  certificate 
that  grant
certificates  to  authorized  users  also  exist,  or  can  be
constructed using available commercial software [2, 3].

Email  protection  in  the  enclave  is  straightforward.
Every  email  message  sent  to  the  enclave  mail  server  is
triply encrypted. First, with the recipient’s public key and
the  user’s  private  key  (digital  signature)  from  the  HPED
and  a  randomly  generated  key—using  the  same  basic
technique as PGP. Next, the  message is sent through the
user’s  encrypted  session.  Finally  it  is  sent  through  the
hardware  encrypted  VPN  link.  All  email  messages  are
stored on one mail server. Because each mail message is
encrypted and contains the sender’s digital  signature  and
the recipient’s public key, storing them on a single server
should provide adequate security.
