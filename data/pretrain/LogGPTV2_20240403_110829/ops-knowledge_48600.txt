User: In Python, am using the LightBlue module for Bluetooth connectivity. How do I get the speed at which I am sending file to my phone from my laptop (Ubuntu)?
Assistant: The simplest solution is to figure out how large the file is, capture the system time before the transfer and after the transfer, and then do the math. To compute a more fine-grained transfer rate that changes over the course of the transfer, you would need to use the size of your transmit buffers and the time interval between sends.
