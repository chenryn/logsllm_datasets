Hello everybody.  
I must be crazy to keep on trying to run cutting-edge open-source software on
my old (but quite stable...) XP laptop !
Version : julia-0.3.0-prerelease-8f1fbec-win32  
"C:\Julia 0.3.0-prerelease\bin>julia" just crashes without a sigh ...
Here is the console outputs in test mode :  
C:\Julia 0.3.0-prerelease\bin>test-julia.bat  
fatal error during bootstrap:  
(arg-error "table: arguments must come in pairs")  
fatal error loading system image
You are doing a really great work !  
Best regards, Stan.
