Subject: Issue Running Julia 0.3.0 Prerelease on Windows XP

Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well.

I must be crazy for continuously attempting to run cutting-edge open-source software on my old, albeit quite stable, Windows XP laptop! 

**Version:** julia-0.3.0-prerelease-8f1fbec-win32

When I try to launch Julia using the command `C:\Julia 0.3.0-prerelease\bin>julia`, it crashes without any warning or error message. Below are the console outputs when running in test mode:

```
C:\Julia 0.3.0-prerelease\bin>test-julia.bat
fatal error during bootstrap:
(arg-error "table: arguments must come in pairs")
fatal error loading system image
```

I am really impressed with the work you are doing!

Best regards,
Stan
