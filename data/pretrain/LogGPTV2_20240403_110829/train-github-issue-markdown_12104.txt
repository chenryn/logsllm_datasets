I am now experimenting with the ES6 import syntax (at least I think it's ES6)
and I noticed that the following is formatted, in my opinion, wrongly:
    import {
    Controller as UploadController,
    State as UploadState
    } from './controllers/upload';
should be:
    import {
        Controller as UploadController,
        State as UploadState
    } from './controllers/upload';
