When using the 'groups' option to validate multiple groups at once, it would
be great if I could find out which validations were triggered in every given
group.
This is how I do it currently:
      $warnings = $validator->validate($entity, array('warning'));
      $errors = $validator->validate($entity, array('error'));
A nicer way would be:
      $messages = $validator->validate($entity, array('warning', 'error'));
And then retreive the matched group or groups from the ConstraintViolation
object with a **getGroups()** method.
Maybe I missed something and this is currently possible. If so, please tell me
how :-)
Thanks.
