User: I'm a very new python user using python 2.6.2 and my question is simple. 
I want to only have the relative path "\file_name" in an input file instead of the full path like "c:\folder_a\folder_b\file_name" but when I use the relevant path in my input files I get the error "Windows Error [Error 2]: The system cannot find the file specified..." otherwise my code works fine.
What do I need to do/change so the system can use the relative path?  It seems since I'm running the script from the same folder such as "c:\folder_a\folder_b>python script_name" in the command terminal the relevant path alone should work.
Assistant: Just try '.\file_name' as your path
2 issues . = current directory, (.. is up one), and you need to escape the \ as \ if using windows file separators.
