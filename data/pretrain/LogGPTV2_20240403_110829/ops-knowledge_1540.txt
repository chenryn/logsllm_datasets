User: Provides a Linux server configuration guide that complies with security best practices.
Assistant: The following are best practices for Linux server configuration: 1. Update the operating system Make sure the server uses the latest operating system version and security patches. Regularly check for updates to the operating system and quickly install any new patches. 2. Configure the firewall Configure the firewall to limit the network traffic and IP addresses entering and leaving the server. Only open necessary ports and services, disable unnecessary services. For public networks, use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect servers and applications. 3. Create a non-root user If you need users to access the server, you should create a non-root user. Grant these users limited root privileges using the sudo command. Before users gain access, make sure their account passwords are strong enough. 4. Encrypted communication Set up a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to establish encrypted communication between the web server and the application. It is also possible to use a VPN to encrypt transmitted data. 5. Securely store passwords and certificates Managing passwords and certificates is key to server security. Do not store passwords and certificates in public locations. Use a password management tool to store passwords and other sensitive data. 6. Turn on the two-step verification for SSH login. Turn on the two-step verification login method, which can effectively protect the server. For details, please refer to: Two-step verification provided by Google. 7. Check file permissions Make sure server file and directory permissions are necessary. Avoid giving non-root users root privileges and unnecessary file access, and ensure sensitive files can only be executed by authorized users. 8. Regular backups Regular backups are key to protecting your server and data. Backups should be kept at a remote location to protect against a single point of failure. Backup frequency should be related to data change frequency. The above are the best practices for Linux server configuration, the most important thing is to keep an eye on new security developments and follow security practices to protect your server.
