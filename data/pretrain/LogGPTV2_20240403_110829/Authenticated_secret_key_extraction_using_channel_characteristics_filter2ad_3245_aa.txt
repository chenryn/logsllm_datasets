ABSTRACT
Simultaneously realizing device authentication and fast se-
cret key extraction is a challenging issue in wireless net-
works. Most existing works solve this problem by utilizing
either advanced hardware or out-of-band channel, which is
not always available for commercial-oﬀ-the-shelf wireless de-
vices. In this work, we solve this challenging issue under the
setting of Wireless Body Area Network (BAN) and propose
a lightweight authenticated secret key extraction scheme,
namely ASK-BAN. The proposed scheme is just based on
wireless channel measurement and does not introduce any
advanced hardware or rely on any out-of-band channel. Ex-
perimental results show that our proposed scheme can oﬀer
a high secret key extraction rate while providing eﬀective
device authentication simultaneously.

INTRODUCTION
Secure wireless communications have been more imper-
ative than ever with the increasing prevalence of wireless
devices. Among the others, two most fundamental issues
for secure wireless communications are device authentication
and secret key extraction. Over years research in this area
has shifted its attention to bootstrapping security for wire-
less communications merely based on physical layer charac-
teristics. Such a fact is motivated by concerns in multi-folds:
pre-loading secret keys on heterogeneous wireless devices is
less practical; wireless devices are more likely subject to
physical compromise attacks; cryptographic primitives for
authentication and key distribution are usually expensive
for wireless devices; most cryptographic primitives assume
computation boundary of attackers; so on and so forth.
Existing works in this direction are mainly based on three
kinds of resources for bootstrapping security: advanced hard-
ware[2], out-of-band communication channel[4], and wire-
less channel measurements[5]. However, the ﬁrst two works

assume extra resources, which are not always available for
low-cost wireless BAN devices, and the third approach does
not provide the two assurances - device authentication and
secret key extraction - simultaneously. As secure wireless
communications are usually based on both authenticity and
secrecy, it is desirable to provide both assurances at the same
time. In this work, we solve this open issue and propose a
lightweight authenticated secret key extraction scheme for
BAN, which is merely based on wireless channel character-
istics. With extensive experimental evaluations, our work
has the follows contributions: 1) to our best knowledge,
ASK-BAN is the ﬁrst that provides authenticated secret key
extraction using only wireless channel measurement; 2) the
multi-hop authentication scheme in ASK-BAN can achieve
much lower false positive rate than previous work; and 3)
this paper proposes a novel collaborative secret key extrac-
tion algorithm based on the max-ﬂow algorithm.
2. MODEL AND ASSUMPTION
In our system, the wireless BAN is composed of n sen-
sors and a CU. As shown in Fig.1(a), these sensors are worn
on the body surface of a patient for measuring physiological
signals of the patient and transmitting the collected data to
the CU. CU is worn on body or placed near the body with
close physical proximity responsible for aggregating and/or
processing the received data, and relaying the data to care-
givers, physicians, emergency services and even medical re-
searchers locally or remotely. CU could be a hand-held de-
vice such as smart phone or PDA, but we do not require CU
to be more powerful than general sensors. We assume one
or more oﬀ-body attacker may present in vicinity. Attacker
devices are oﬀ the body and their locations can be either
line-of-sight (LOS) or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) to the BAN
user and the on-body devices including sensors and the CU.
3. THE ASK-BAN PROTOCOL
In BANA[5], the device authentication(between CU and
on-body sensors) is based on the signiﬁcant diﬀerence of
channel loss behaviors between on-body and oﬀ-body un-
der certain body movements. That is, an oﬀ-body channel
displays much severer fading than an on-body channel over
time. However, simultaneously achieving device authentica-
tion and fast key extraction faces the following dilemma: on
one hand, we need to utilize the stable channel to achieve
device authentication following BANA; on the other hand,
fast key extraction requires a high channel entropy, which
means that the channel should be relatively unstable. To
1028solve this problem, we observe that the trust relationship of
on-body devices is transitive:
if node A is on-body and A
trusts B (i.e. the channel between A and B is stable), we
have a high conﬁdence that B is also on-body under certain
body movements. For example, in Fig1(b), if CU is con-
vinced node 3 is on-body and node 3 believes that node 4 is
on-body, CU has the conﬁdence that node 4 is also on-body.
Based on this observation, our scheme solves the dilemma
using the following rationale:
for node authentication, we
look for possibly multi-hop trust/stable wireless channel(s)
between CU and the on-body sensor (OBS) during certain
body movements; for fast secret key extraction, we utilize
the unstable path(s) between CU and OBS to maximize the
channel entropy, which we identify as a single-source single-
sink max-ﬂow problem. Our experiments show that, with
careful node deployment, we can easily guarantee the exis-
tence of the two kinds of channels between the CU and any
OBS. Our design can be described as follows:
(1) Pairwise Key Generation: A shared secret key will be
generated for each pair of sensors in the system, which is de-
noted as kij between sensor Si and sensor Sj. In our exper-
iments, we utilize Adaptive Secret Bit Generation (ASBG)
to build the shared secret key from RSS measurements. To
tackle quadratic rounds execution limitation in ASBG, we
utilizes time division duplex (TDD) method to aggregate the
communication. That is, the nodes in ASK-BAN broadcast
messages in the round robin fashion.
(2) Initial Authentication: CU ﬁrst broadcasts a hello
message M = (x, t0, t) using a certain transmission power
Ptx to the sensors around it, requesting responses after x sec-
onds, where x is a random number picked by CU. Upon re-
ceiving the hello message, each responding sensor randomly
chooses a small number tr and broadcasts it, indicating the
starting time for sending response message. CU collects and
checks all the tr values, ensuring no duplicated ones exist
to avoid further transmission collision. And then all the
responding sensors broadcast response messages m in the
TDD manner as scheduled, repeatedly every t milliseconds
and last for t0 seconds. During the t0 seconds, each node
measures the RSS value of each received message. After col-
lecting the RSSs for responding sensors, each node calculates
the average RSS variation (ARV) for all the other nodes.
Based on all the ARV values computed, classiﬁcation will
be performed to partition them into two groups(one has a
smaller mean of ARVs and the other one has a larger one).
According to the classiﬁcation result, the CU accepts the
sensors whose ARVs belong to the group with smaller ARV
mean and rejects the remaining ones in another group.
(3) Authenticated Secret Capacity Broadcast: To construct
a key between itself and the CU, each sensor broadcasts the
secret capacities(the number of bits with each pairwise secret
key generated in step 1, “capacity” for short) of the channel
between itself and each of all the remaining sensors and thus
obtain the system’s weighted capacity topology. Authenti-
cation is performing along with the capacity broadcasting.
To be speciﬁc, a sensor node Sk broadcasts a capacity
message (IDk, IDl, T /F, Ckl) which contains the ID of the
endpoints of the channel with each of its neighbors, say Sl,
the trust relationship learned from the ﬁrst phase with T
representing accept and F rejection, and the channel secret
capacity C. Sensors that receive capacity messages store
the messages in the buﬀer temporarily. Meanwhile, each

of Sk’s neighbors measures the channel, collects RSS values
and calculate Sk’s ARV for later authentication.
For a single node, it assumes there are a null trusted group
at the beginning. After all the sensors have broadcast ca-
