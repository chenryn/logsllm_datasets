### Title: AcuTherm: A Hybrid Attack on Password Entry Based on Both Acoustic and Thermal Side-Channels

Despite predictions of their obsolescence and calls for their replacement, passwords remain the most prevalent form of user authentication. Traditional vulnerabilities in password systems often stem from insecure storage practices and low entropy. However, with the increasing threat of insider attacks, the security of password entry itself has become a critical concern. While obvious attacks, such as shoulder-surfing, can be mitigated, more subtle side-channel attacks pose a significant challenge.

A recent class of opportunistic password attacks, known as Thermanator, exploits the thermal side-channel to target password entry on standard plastic keyboards. In a successful Thermanator attack, the victim must leave the keyboard shortly after entering the password, allowing an attacker to capture a thermal image using an inexpensive camera. Research shows that a full set of key-presses can be recovered up to 30 seconds after entry, and a substantial subset can be retrieved up to a minute later. However, Thermanator attacks do not provide the order of key-presses or reveal repeated keys, which limits their practicality due to the large potential search space for passwords.

Fortunately, or unfortunately, there are multiple side-channels available during password entry. The acoustic side-channel, specifically the sounds produced by keystrokes, has been extensively studied and is quite effective. However, it typically requires a lengthy, victim-specific training phase to build accurate acoustic models.

In this presentation, we introduce AcuTherm, a new class of hybrid attacks that combines the strengths of both thermal and acoustic side-channels. To our knowledge, AcuTherm is the first systematically investigated hybrid side-channel attack. Our experiments involved over 20 participants using three common types of keyboards and a variety of representative passwords. The results clearly demonstrate that AcuTherm significantly improves the accuracy of determining key-press order and identifying duplicate key-presses, thereby reducing the password search space without the need for victim-specific acoustic models.
