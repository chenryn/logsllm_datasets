Subject: Druid Query Error on Single-Node "Quickstart" Configuration

Hello,

I am encountering the following error when running a query that returns a large number of records. The same query runs without any issues when only a few records are returned. I am currently using a single-node "quickstart" configuration.

**Error Details:**

```
2017-09-19 11:03:54 DEBUG DruidDao:414 - SQL: 
SELECT A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, L 
FROM dataSource 
WHERE A IN ('aValue') AND B IN ('SomeVALUE');

[WARNING] /dl
AvaticaClientRuntimeException: Remote driver error: IllegalStateException:

reassigned explicitly. Error -1 (00000) UNKNOWN

**Caused by:**

```
java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.IllegalStateException:
DefaultQueryMetrics must not be modified from multiple threads. If it is
needed to gather dimension or metric information from multiple threads or from
an async thread, this information should explicitly be passed between threads

```

**Additional Information:**

- **Environment:** Single-node "quickstart" configuration.
- **Query:** The query works fine with a small number of records but fails with a larger dataset.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
