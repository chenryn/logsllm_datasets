User: How to use Prometheus to monitor applications in Kubernetes cluster? Please include steps such as Prometheus configuration, exporter deployment, and data query.
Assistant: Monitoring applications in a Kubernetes cluster often requires the use of tools. Prometheus is a popular open source tool for monitoring Kubernetes applications by configuring and using Prometheus Exporter. The following are the steps to use Prometheus to monitor Kubernetes applications: 1. Install Prometheus You can download the corresponding software package from the official website of Prometheus. After downloading, you can start Prometheus with the following command: ``` ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml ``` 2. Configure Prometheus The Prometheus configuration file is located at prometheus.yml. You need to add configuration items related to Kubernetes. Here is an example of a basic configuration file: ``` global: scrape_interval: 15s evaluation_interval: 15s scrape_configs: - job_name: 'prometheus' static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9090'] - job_name: 'kubernetes' kubernetes_sd_configs: - role: endpoints namespaces: names: - default - role: pod namespaces: names: - default relabel_configs: - action: labelmap regex: __meta_kubernetes_pod_label_(.+) - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app] action: keep regex: your-app-name metrics_path: /metrics scheme: http port: 8080 ``` Please make necessary modifications according to the Kubernetes cluster and your application. eg. - Set Prometheus's scraping interval and evaluation interval by setting scrape_interval and evaluation_interval. - static_configs defines the static configuration to be taken when Prometheus fetches data. Here, only the indicator data of the local (localhost) Prometheus is captured. - kubernetes_sd_configs defines the source for Prometheus to obtain indicator data. Here we use endpoints and pods from the Kubernetes API. The namespace attribute is used to filter the Kubernetes namespaces to monitor. For example, only monitor the namespace named default. - relabel_configs defines label rewriting rules. This can be used to select applications to monitor. action: keep means that the application filter only includes the metric data whose application label matches the value displayed. 3. Deploy Prometheus Exporter In order to provide metrics data about your application accordingly, you first need to deploy a Prometheus Exporter in your application. Here is an example of a PromSQL exporter: ``` apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: promsql-exporter spec: selector: matchLabels: app: promsql-exporter template: metadata: labels: app: promsql-exporter spec: containers: - name: promsql-exporter image: promsql-exporter:v1.0 ports: - name: promsql containerPort: 3000 ``` This YAML file will create a deployment that contains a standalone Prometheus Exporter. Please make necessary modifications according to your application. 4. Deploy the Prometheus configuration If you have completed the previous steps, the next step is to associate the configuration with the Prometheus instance in the Kubernetes cluster. Use kubectl to deploy Prometheus configuration: ``` kubectl create -f prometheus.yml ``` 5. Deploy Grafana To view the data monitored by Prometheus, you can use Grafana to create and manage visualization panels. You can download the corresponding software package from Grafana's official website for installation. Once installed, you can access the Grafana dashboard and connect to your Prometheus instance using the Prometheus data source. 6. Others You can use the query language PromQL provided by Prometheus to query data. For example, if you want to query all metrics with a specified label, use the following query: ``` prometheus_metric{app="your-app-name"} ``` You can learn more about PromQL queries in the official Prometheus documentation on a case-by-case basis Instructions. In general, you can set up and use Prometheus Exporter to monitor Kubernetes applications through the above steps.
