I have a quasar/vue3 app but upgrading all realease after the 0.21.1 infinite
cycle of request start  
I made two simple codepen where you can see the problem  
1.21.1  
1.21.2
I can't figure out what's is the root cause of that , maybe related to other
"similar" bug  
Sorry if is a sort of duplicate
