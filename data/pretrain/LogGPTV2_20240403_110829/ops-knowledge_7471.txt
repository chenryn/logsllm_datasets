User: My record sheet app has a menu option for creating a new, blank record sheet. When I open a sheet window, I can open new windows without a problem, using subprocess.Popen() to do it.
However, under Windows (I haven't tested it on other OSes yet), if I open a new window then use the "open file" dialog to populate the fields with data from a file, I'm no longer able to create new windows. Once it's populated, Windows gives me the 

'foo.py' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file.

I don't understand what would cause Windows to suddenly not recognize the Popen() call. I don't have any code that would affect it in any way that I'm aware of.
Assistant: The suggested answer seems to have fixed the problem. I also realized that I needed to use os.name to determine which OS is being used, then I can use the correct path format for loading the external Python file.
