to initiate ten provided actions within the next 30 days or
whether they had taken action already. We only include 500
breach-speciﬁc responses in the following analysis due to
a data storage issue, excluding incomplete responses. Fig-
ure 6 shows the results. Of the ten provided actions, chang-
ing the password for the breached organizations’ account or
other accounts were the most popular, receiving more than
half of likely/already done responses. “Review credit reports
and/or ﬁnancial statements” had the highest percentage of
already done (30%). By contrast, most participants selected
“not likely” for four actions — “use a credit/identity monitor-
ing service,” “place a credit freeze on my credit reports,” “ﬁle
a complaint with a consumer protection agency,” and “take
legal action against the breached organization.” This ﬁnding
is understandable given that most leaked data types such as
email addresses and passwords are considered “non-sensitive
records” according to ITRC’s report [30].
We sought to understand factors that would impact the
likelihood of having taken any of the ten provided actions
through a mixed-effect logistic regression. For independent
variables, we discarded variables related to email habits since
many of the listed actions were unrelated to one’s email ac-
count. We kept all other independent variables from the con-
cern regression model, namely prior awareness, the breach’s
age, the number of breached data types, and the breach sta-
tus of six data types with relatively high concern levels. We
further included overall concern Likert responses as an in-
dependent variable. Results in Table 5 show a signiﬁcant
intercept, indicating that participants were likely to default

RQ4: What are participants’ emotional responses to data
breaches that affected them? While some leaked data
types (e.g., password, physical address, and phone number)
triggered heightened concerns, overall participants reported
low concern about data breaches: 56% were slight or some-
what concerned, and 19% were not at all concerned. However,
participants expressed a rich set of (mostly negative) emotions
beyond concerns, such as feeling upset with the breached or-
ganization and feeling fatigued by the sheer number of data
breaches nowadays.
5.5 RQ5: Behavioral Reactions to Breaches
For the 143 breaches participants were already aware of be-
fore our study, we further asked if they had taken any action in
response (Questions 18). The most common action taken was
to change passwords (87, 61%). 15 speciﬁed they changed the
password for the breached account, and 27 mentioned chang-
ing the password across multiple accounts that might use the
leaked password. Five further mentioned changing their email
account’s password; this could be due to a misconception
that their email account, not the account with the breached
organization, was compromised. Participants also described
other password-related practices triggered by the breach, such
as using unique passwords, using a password manager, and
making passwords more complicated.
Participants reported having taken a variety of actions re-
lated to their account with the breached organization. 18
(13%) deleted or deactivated the account, and one mentioned
reviewing accounts on other websites and deleting them as
needed. Five mentioned enabling 2FA for the breached organi-
zations’ account, for other accounts, or for their email account.
Four reported checking the breached organization’s account
to see if it stored any sensitive data or if there had been any
suspicious activity. In 31 (22%) cases, participants reported
doing nothing in reaction; the percentage was lower than that
in Ponemon’s 2014 survey (32%) [31], but still substantial.
Additionally, we asked all participants with at least one
breach to indicate, for each breach, how likely they were

concern (ORintercept =0.04, p=.02). Being aware of a breach
signiﬁcantly increased the likelihood of having taken any
of the listed actions (ORno
yes=390.48, p<.001). This is unsur-
prising given that participants who were unaware of being
affected had little motivation to engage in protective measures.
Additionally, more concern was signiﬁcantly correlated with
a higher likelihood of having taken action: for a one-unit in-
crease of concern on the 5-point Likert scale, the odds of hav-
ing taken action increase by 2.22 (ORconcern=2.22, p=.005).
RQ5: What factors inﬂuence participants’ likelihood to
take action in response to data breaches that affected them?
Participants’ intention to act varies among protective mea-
sures: they were more amenable to change passwords and
check credit reports/ﬁnancial records than other actions. The
regression results reveal that awareness and concern drive
the likelihood of taking action, while other factors such as
the leaked data types do not impact the outcome. Our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that to motivate consumers to react to breaches,
they must ﬁrst be aware that the breach occurred and feel
concerned enough to invest in mitigation efforts.
6 Discussion
We examined individuals’ awareness, perception, and re-
sponses to speciﬁc data breaches that had exposed their email
addresses and other information. Compared to RAND’s 2016
survey [1], in which 44% reported already knowing about
a breach before receiving a notiﬁcation, participants’ prior
awareness was much lower in our sample. This ﬁnding is
concerning as our results suggest that unawareness creates a
substantial barrier for taking mitigating action. Participants
also reported a lower level of overall concern than in prior
work [31, 37]: this might result from a methodological dif-
ference, as our participants reﬂected on speciﬁc breaches af-
fecting them rather than on breaches in general [1, 31] or
on hypothetical scenarios [37]. Another possible reason is
that the leaked data types in the HIBP database are mostly
categorized as non-sensitive records [30]. While participants
named potential consequences of data breaches such as more
spams and increased risks of identity theft, similar to prior
work [37, 99], many considered these events would have little
to no impact on their lives. Most participants also exhibited
misconceptions about what led to themselves being affected
by breaches, blaming their own email or password behaviors
rather than the breached organization.
Set stricter legal requirements for notifying consumers.
Our study reﬂects a sad reality that many individuals are un-
aware that they are affected by breaches, at least for breaches
exposing email addresses. Current breach notiﬁcation require-
ments, mechanisms, and tools fail to reach data breach victims.
Nonetheless, awareness was a crucial trigger of taking action,
according to our regression results.
Stricter regulatory requirements may help establish high
standards for breach notiﬁcations, which in turn raise aware-
ness. Simply requiring companies to send the notiﬁcation is
not enough as the notiﬁcation also needs to be effective [8,98].
For instance, prior work highlights the role of media reports
in informing and shaping attitudes of data breaches [1, 15].
Our ﬁndings indicate that notiﬁcations from breached organi-
zations or third-party services are more relevant. Given that
individuals may not stick with one channel to learn about
breaches, breached organizations could be mandated to notify
consumers in multiple channels instead of the most conve-
nient one, and obtain conﬁrmation from victims that the noti-
ﬁcation was received. Regarding when to notify, Art. 34 of
Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) spec-
iﬁes that consumer-facing notiﬁcations are only needed for
breaches that “result in a high risk” to data subjects [22]. We
argue that this should be done for all breaches, given that
many court cases struggle to assess risks and harms caused
by data breaches [81]; this requirement would also be more
in line with consumer preferences [54]. Alternatively, less
ambiguous criteria should be set for high-risk breaches, e.g.,
in California, consumer-facing notiﬁcations are mandated
when the breach involves unencrypted personally identiﬁable
information [82].
Use novel approaches in notifying consumers. Prior re-
search on SSL warnings [3, 23, 24] shows that in-browser
warnings effectively raise threat awareness and encourage
safer practices. Similarly, data breach notiﬁcations could ex-
plore approaches beyond letters and emails, such as in-situ
methods whereby visiting affected sites leads to a notiﬁca-
tion [17], as recently pursued by some browsers and password
managers that warn users if saved passwords appeared in
credential dumps [44, 62].
Notiﬁcations should also consider non-adherence: among
participants who were already aware of a breach before our
study, 22% reported doing nothing in response to that breach;
emotions like fatigue and resignation were also noted. Draw-
ing from warning design literature on mitigating fatigue in
email-based notiﬁcations [7,42], one could build systems that
highlight unread breach notiﬁcations in email clients, similar
to Gmail’s reminders to reply to emails [10]. The contents of
such emails could also be automatically parsed and reformat-
ted to guide attention to important details.
Address misconceptions. Participants commonly blamed
their own email habits or security practices for data breaches,
and such misconceptions exacerbate a power asymmetry —
rather than demanding that organizations improve security
measures or that regulators hold them accountable, partici-
pants blamed themselves. Consumers should be reminded that
the root cause of breaches is security issues in the breached
404    30th USENIX Security Symposium

organization, and there are actions that can hold the breached
organization accountable, such as ﬁling a complaint with a
consumer protection agency (e.g., the Federal Trade Commis-
sion for US breaches).
Participants also differed regarding perceived impacts of
breaches. Those who had not experienced adverse impacts
mostly did not take data breaches seriously. Conversely, those
who had experienced an adverse event reported emotional dis-
tress and resulting behavioral changes. Indeed, not everyone
would experience the negative consequences of not reacting
to data breaches, but the cost is real and immediate when the
consequences manifest. Breach notiﬁcations and education
materials should stress that good security practices, such as
using unique passwords and 2FA, can dampen the severity
of a breach’s impact even though they do not decrease one’s
likelihood of being affected by a breach. While these pre-
cautionary measures might not provide instant gratiﬁcation,
they could be worthy investments considering the substantial
hassles and trauma in recovering from identity theft [43] or
other repercussions of breaches.
Develop tools to help consumers react to breaches.
While consumers may not be able to prevent breaches from
occurring, actions are available for mitigating the aftermath
of a breach. Our ﬁndings show that some straightforward ac-
tions, such as changing passwords, had high adoption rates
or intention to adopt. Yet, the majority of provided actions
were much less popular (see Figure 6), indicating the need to
offer more relevant and usable protective measures to affected
individuals.
One of our key ﬁndings is that extensive use of an email
account (e.g., use it for a long time and check it frequently)
signiﬁcantly increased the email address’s likelihood of being
involved in a breach. Yet, simply asking users to reduce their
usage or abandon their email account is not a viable solu-
tion, as it also diminishes the email account’s utility. Instead,
drawing from some participants’ descriptions of creating ded-
icated email accounts for registration on low-value sites, we
see the promise of more automated tools to offer unique email
aliases for account registration. Such features could further
be integrated into other technologies with broader adoption,
such as browsers or password managers, to create a more
streamlined experience (e.g., through auto-ﬁlling). Recent re-
spective efforts include “Sign in with Apple”8 and “Firefox
Relay”9, both of which support the generation of a unique,
random email address during account registration, which is
forwarded to a user’s real inbox. However, both products are
currently limited to their respective ecosystems. The effec-
tiveness, awareness, and adoption of such tools, as well as
how individuals manage multiple email aliases in general, are
open questions for future research.

Increasing responsibilities of breached organizations.
Our participants exhibited a low awareness of data breaches,
which in turn serves as a precursor to the low intention for
certain protective measures. This lack of awareness and self-
protection among participants indicates that breached organi-
zations should play a more active role in protecting affected
individuals. Notifying victims should not absolve breached
organizations from further responsibility — they should fur-
ther ensure that consumers have viable remediation solutions
and assist in the recovery process, such as offering support
in identity restoration. Rather than defaulting to conventional
credit and identity monitoring services, which are known to
provide little preventative protection [40], breached organi-
zations could offer victims email alias generators, password
managers, or other more promising mitigation tools by part-
nering with respective service providers. Regulators should
also set and frequently revisit requirements for the types of
services breached organizations must offer as compensation.
Importantly, breached organizations have ﬁnancial incen-
tives for transparent post-breach communications and active
mitigation. Prior work shows that data breach notiﬁcations
provide a venue for impression management and repairing
damaged trust [33]. Moreover, breached organizations that
provide affected individuals with free credit monitoring ser-
vices face a lower likelihood of lawsuits [73]. Regulators
should also create meaningful incentives for organizations to
act accordingly. For instance, the GDPR’s threat of substan-
tial ﬁnes has resulted in a heightened effort by organizations
worldwide to overhaul their privacy and security programs.
7 Conclusion
Our study provides insights into individuals’ awareness, per-
ception, and responses to data breaches. We applied a novel
method that presented participants with speciﬁc data breaches
exposing their email addresses and other information. Our
ﬁndings reveal some concerning aspects, such as participants’
low awareness of breaches that affected them and miscon-
ceptions about the causes and impacts of being involved in
these breaches. We outline potential avenues for addressing
these identiﬁed issues — improving consumers’ awareness of
breaches affecting them, developing novel and useful tools
to help consumers mitigate the impacts of breaches, and in-
