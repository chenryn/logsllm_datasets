User: How to execute the same task on multiple servers simultaneously using Ansible?
Assistant: To execute the same task on multiple servers concurrently, you can use Ansible playbook and inventory files. 1. Create an inventory file: The inventory file contains the IP addresses or hostnames of all the servers to execute the task on. Within a file, grouping and group variables can be used for organization and management. 2. Create a playbook: A playbook is a script that describes the tasks to be performed. It includes descriptions of hosts, variables, tasks and processing results. 3. Run the playbook on the Ansible control node: You can use the ansible-playbook command to run the playbook on the control node, which will send the tasks in the playbook to each host in turn. 4. Wait for the task to complete: the same task in the playbook will be run on each host, and after the tasks on all hosts are completed, a summary report of the playbook execution results will be generated. In short, using Ansible playbook can execute the same task on multiple servers at the same time, improving efficiency and reliability.
