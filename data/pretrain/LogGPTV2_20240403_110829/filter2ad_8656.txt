### 1\. Introduction
Venezuela is a tropical country located in the north of South America and the
most important oil producing country in South America. According to the 2012
World Energy Statistics Report, Venezuela has proven oil reserves of 296.5
billion barrels, accounting for 18% of the world. Oil exports have also become
the main economic pillar of the country.
Due to the influence of various factors such as the country's policies and the
international situation, the country's oil production is declining in recent
years, and the domestic situation is turbulent. On the evening of March 7th,
2019, a large-scale blackout occurred in Venezuela, and the country was in a
dark state.
This paper will analyze and judge the network construction situation and power
outage events in the country from the perspective of network space mapping.
### 2\. Venezuela Network Construction
As of March 15th, 2019, ZoomEye has included a total of 3,067,202 banner
information for 1,637,553 IP in Venezuela.
#### 2.1 Device Type Statistics
The identified device components account for approximately 2/3 of the
country's total equipment components, with the ZTE ZXV10 W300 router's web
management interface accounting for approximately 1/10 of the total device
components.

It is worth mentioning that a total of 306,444 ZTE ZXV10 W300 routers and
299,250 Dropbear sshd services are identified, and the IP addresses of the ZTE
ZXV10 W300 router which has a Dropbear sshd service are up to 244,111.
Therefore, a judgment can be made that the router may be widely used as a home
router. This means that once the vulnerable router is attacked, it can lead to
a wide range of home networks paralysis in Venezuela.
#### 2.2 Open Port Statistics
The port distribution is as follows:

According to the known conclusions of 2.1, the banners which have been
identified in the country mainly belong to the ZTE ZXV10 W300 router. The 80,
443, 22, and 7547 ports account for a relatively high proportion of the
router.
It is worth noting that port 5357 appears in the tenth place, of which 62139
banners are recognized as Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0. After judging, these IPs
belong to Movilnet. According to its official website, Movilnet is a
subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned telephone and Internet service provider
CANTV.
#### 2.3 ISP Statistics
According to the ISP (Internet Service Provider) statistics, the results are
as follows:

CANTV, Venezuela's state-owned telephone and Internet service provider, has an
absolute advantage, with 85% of IP owned by the company.
Note: CANTV is a national telephone and Internet service provider, which is
the largest telecommunications provider in Venezuela. After privatization in
1991, it was re-nationalized in 2007. Concerned about the routers belonging to
this ISP, most of them are ZTE ZXV10 W300, and a few of them are other brands,
such as D-Link, TP-Link, etc. Some routers may have vulnerabilities. (such as
the D-Link DIR series, their routers have a large number of security
vulnerabilities in history. There are three D-Link DIR series routers
belonging to this ISP.)

Statistics of the Identified Components Belonging to CANTV
The second-ranked Corporación Telemic C.A. is a Venezuelan television
broadcaster and telecommunications provider. Compared to the components of
CANTV, there are not a large number of civilian routers belonging to this ISP,
instead, there are 11,219 components identified as Microsoft HTTPAPI httpd. It
has been verified that these IP addresses are used by the real Windows
systems.
#### 2.4 HTTPS Certificate Statistics
The ZoomEye cyberspace search engine identified a total of 252,144 HTTPS
certificate information. After removing the certificate information such as
the router's certificate and self-signed certificate, a total of 645 domain
names information was extracted. The types of the domain names are as follows:

Government and educational websites make up a quarter of the total number of
websites. Mail-based websites account for 12%, and other types of websites
account for only 62%. From the perspective of HTTPS certificates, the
country's Internet development is relatively backward, and
government/educational websites are still the main force for Internet
development in the country.
#### 2.5 Security Response Capability
After the leak of the EternalBlue in 2017, the ability to quickly fix the
vulnerability also reflect the security response capability.

It can be seen that on April 24th, 2017, when the vulnerability just broke
out, only three hosts were implanted in the backdoor of Doublepulsar. This
also reflects from the side that the country is not the main target of cyber
warfare. But three weeks after the vulnerability has broken out, there are
still 132 hosts with vulnerabilities in the country, only 47 fewer than the
original 179, which also reflects the country's lack of security response
capabilities.
#### 2.6 Oil Sales Channels
During the understanding of the country's background, it can be known that the
country mainly relies on oil exports. But after searching the existing banner,
we only found one company related to oil production (`http://200.*.*.*`) and
one company that exports all kinds of items (including oil) (`http:/
/201.*.*.*`).
It also reflects that the country’s oil exports have fixed distribution
channels, confirming the fact that oil exploitation is controlled by state-owned enterprises.
#### 2.7 Distribution of ICS Ports
According to the data of the ZoomEye cyberspace search engine, a small number
of industrial control system devices in Venezuela was exposed to the public
network. Known industrial control system devices or industrial control
protocols (active in the past year) are as follows:
ICS devices/protocols | Quantity  
---|---  
Siemens S7 PLC Device | 1  
Modbus | 6  
BACnet | 1  
Crimson V3 | 1  
OMRON FINS | 1
