User: I have a zip file, but no unzipping tool installed.  I do have python installed, but I can't easily create a python script file on this machine.  How do I unzip the contents of the zip file using the python executable's -c argument?
Assistant: I found the solution to be this:
python -c "import zipfile;file=zipfile.ZipFile('archive.zip');file.extractall('.')"
The contents of archive.zip will be placed into the directory this command is executed from.
