## 1. Overview
The following sections detail the proposed time- and temperature-aware architecture for 3D Multi-Level Cell (MLC) Phase Change Memory (PCM). This architecture aims to reduce drift-related soft errors by integrating adaptive sensing mechanisms into the memory controller.

## 2. Time- and Temperature-Aware Sensing for 3D-MLC PCM
To mitigate resistance drift in 3D MLC PCM, we propose a hybrid technique that combines inter-level margins with a time- and temperature-aware sensing scheme. The inter-level margins can handle approximately 60% to 70% of memory accesses, as observed in Section III.

### 2.1 Mechanism for Handling Resistance Drift
- **Memory Controller**: Determines the mechanism based on elapsed time and elevated temperature.
- **Resistance Margin**: If the margin cannot cover the drift, the reference voltages in the read circuit are adjusted according to the elapsed time and temperature.
- **Time-Tag**: When writing a block to main memory, the current time is also written to the time-tag part of each memory block.
- **Drift Controller Unit**: During a read operation, this unit determines the extent of resistance drift. If the margins are insufficient, the reference voltages are updated using Equation 1.

### 2.2 Estimating Resistance Drift
To reduce the error rate of the sensing circuit, it is crucial to accurately adjust resistance thresholds after drift. We assume the initial resistance of each state is set within ±3σ of the mean, where σ is the standard deviation of a normal distribution.

- **Design-Time Calculation**: Values of the resistance drift law for different times and temperatures are calculated and stored in a non-volatile memory.
- **State Border Table (SBT)**: At boot time, these values are loaded into a small DRAM at the PCM controller. SBT acts as a dictionary for evaluated drift law values, enabling runtime adjustments without additional calculations.

### 2.3 Collecting Time and Temperature Information
- **Global Timer**: A global timer in the PCM controller tracks the system cycle.
- **Time-Tag**: Each memory line has a time-tag that saves the controller’s timestamp when its content is written.
- **Thermal Sensors**: Scattered across the processor and memory dies, these sensors frequently send temperature data to a sensor selection unit for thermal profiling.

### 2.4 Adaptive Threshold Sensing Circuit
The read circuit must be reconfigurable to adaptively interpret cell resistance. We use a flexible sensing circuit that compares the cell's voltage with a ramp source output. The counter value is then compared with boundary resistance values from the SBT to quantify the cell content.

## 3. Evaluation
We performed micro-architectural level simulations using an out-of-order processor model with UltraSPARCIII ISA and GEMS simulator. CACTI 6.5 was used for detailed area, power, and timing models, while HotSpot provided thermal estimations.

### 3.1 System Configuration
- **Processor**: 4-core UltraSPARC T1 CMP with a TDP of 54 W at 2.5 GHz and 1.3 V supply voltage.
- **Memory Hierarchy**: 3 levels of caches and a PCM main memory.
- **3D Structure**: A 4-tier true 3D structure with peripheral circuits at the bottom layer for speed optimization.

### 3.2 Workload Characteristics
- **PARSEC-2, 2009, Multi-Threaded Workloads**: Blackscholes, Bodytrack, Caneal, Dedup, Facesim, Ferret, Fluidanimate, Freqmine, Raytrace, Streamcluster, Swaptions, Vips, X264.
- **SPECCPU, 2006, 4-Application Multi-Programmed Workloads**: mcf, GemsFDTD, povray, perlbench, xalancbmk, omnetpp, bzip2, milc, leslie3d, lbm, gcc.

### 3.3 Results
- **Resistance Margins**: For our baseline system, the coefficient variation is 17%. For the proposed system, it is approximately 13%.
- **Error Rate**: Using the last value of the sensors for estimating resistance drift, about 45% of memory accesses have maximum temperature differences of less than 1°C, 66% for 2°C, and 85% for 5°C.

This approach effectively reduces the error rate and ensures reliable operation of 3D MLC PCM under varying temperature and time conditions.
