ONLY USE THEM TO DETECT/LOCALIZE HUMAN MOTION.
walking path available to the adversary also differs across
experiments, from indoor corridors outside the apartment to
outdoor pathways. Table II lists the test scene conﬁguration
while Figure 7 shows ﬂoor plan examples derived from pub-
licly available data. Across all experiments, attack parameters
remain unchanged (as listed in Table I).
Inside each test scene, we either reuse existing WiFi
devices or deploy our own WiFi devices to emulate smart
homes and ofﬁces. We use popular commodity products for
smart ofﬁces and homes, e.g., wireless security cameras, voice
assistants, WiFi routers, and smart switches. In total, we have
31 WiFi devices, including 6 security cameras. These devices
are naturally placed at locations where they are designed to
be: security cameras at room corners, smart switches on the
wall outlets, and WiFi routers in the center of the room for
coverage. Our experiments use the 2.4GHz WiFi band due to
its dominant coverage. We also test 5GHz WiFi and do not
observe notable difference except its shorter coverage.
Table III summarizes these devices and their trafﬁc patterns
during idle and active periods. The packet rate varies from 0.5
packet per second (pps) to more than 100 pps. Even when idle,
they still periodically transmit packets. It should be noted that
to prevent attackers from inferring user presence by simply
counting the packet rate of a device (if an Amazon Echo is
sending more packets, it means that a human user is around),
devices like home voice assistants, smart TVs, and motion-
triggered cameras will need to send cover trafﬁc when in idle
state and the corresponding idle packet rate will be much
higher than the listed number.
change anchor placements and repeat the experiments. In total,
we collect more than 3000 RSS measurement traces, with more
than 121,000 location-RSS tuples.
Continuous sensing. We place a static sniffer behind plants
or at the corners (on the ground) outside of the target building
within 2m to the building wall. We ask volunteers to carry
out normal activities in each test scene and collect more than
41hrs of aCSI entries (7.8hrs of human presence, labeled). The
volunteers are aware of the attack goals but not the techniques.
B. Evaluation of Continuous Human Sensing
We start from evaluating the continuous sensing component
of our attack. Here we assume that the attacker knows the
actual room where each anchor resides. By default, the attacker
only uses anchors whose packet rate ≥ 11pps.
Performance metrics. Our goal is to evaluate whether the
continuous sensing component is able to correctly detect user
presence/motion in each room. We divide time into 5s slots,
and run continuous sensing to estimate room occupancy in
each slot based on aCSI variance values. We compare these
estimates to ground truth values, and compute the detection
rate and false positive rate as follows.
• Detection rate (DR) measures the probability of the attack
is actually
reporting a room as being occupied when it
occupied, across all the slots.
• False positive rate (FP) measures the probability of a room
not being occupied when our attack reports that it is being
occupied.
Bootstrapping. To benchmark our bootstrapping design, we
collect, for each test scene, 50 walking measurements, each of
25–50 meters in length and 0.5–2 minutes in time. We also
Under our adversarial scenario, having a high detection rate is
more important since the attacker does not want to miss the
presence of any targets.

Human sensing accuracy.
Table IV lists the detection rate
and false positive rate when we vary the number of anchors per
room. We see that the detection rate scales with the number
of anchors per room, reaching 86.8%, 95.03% 99.85%, and
99.988% with 1, 2, 3, and 4 anchors per room, respectively.
This trend is as expected since having more anchors increases
the chance that a user movement triggers at least one anchor.
Furthermore, the false positive rate is low (20m in distance and the RSS values
are between -75dB and -30dB without strong bias, we observe
little difference in localization (and room placement) accuracy.
