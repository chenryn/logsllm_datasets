### Typo Email Filtering and Analysis

#### Threshold Selection
In our corpus, the key insight is that true typo emails should be unique and rare. We set frequency thresholds for receiver, sender, and content based on the distribution of these features to include common frequencies while excluding outliers. The receiver address frequency threshold was set to 20, and both the sender address and content thresholds were set to 10. The rationale behind these thresholds can be found in our online appendix.

#### Performance Analysis
To ensure our spam filtering performs effectively, we conducted a small manual analysis of receiver typo emails. We randomly selected five emails (collected between June 6 and September 16, 2016) for each domain where we expected to receive such emails. One researcher analyzed these emails to determine if they were spam. In total, 77 emails were labeled, with 80% found not to be spam. Detailed per-domain results are available in the online Appendix.

We also analyzed 26 emails from domains where we did not expect to receive anything but SMTP typos, yet were classified as receiver typos by our system. 25 out of these 26 emails were correctly identified as receiver typos.

### Data Collection and Analysis

#### Data Collection Period
Our infrastructure collected data over more than seven months. To normalize the data, we project the numbers over a full year. Given the seven-month study period, we assume that daily, weekly, monthly, and seasonal effects are accounted for. When we collect \( x \) emails, we report the number \( y = x \cdot \frac{365}{d} \), where \( d \) is the number of days we actually collected data for that domain.

#### Email Volume
Figures 3 and 4 show the daily email count, broken down between receiver typos (Figure 3) and SMTP typos (Figure 4). Gaps in collection correspond to times when our infrastructure was malfunctioning, often due to being overwhelmed with spam. SMTP typo emails are received sparsely in small batches, as expected, since users rarely make SMTP typos and quickly correct them. Receiver typos, however, occur at a near-constant rate.

Based on the seven months of data, our infrastructure receives approximately 118,894,960 emails per year. Of these, 16,233,730 are candidates for receiver or reflection typos, and 102,661,230 are candidates for SMTP typos. Only 7,260 emails per year pass all filters, and after manual correction, this number is further reduced to 6,041 emails per year being either receiver or reflection typos.

For SMTP typo candidates, 5,147 emails per year are sent by automated agents, 5,555 are frequency filtered, and 415 are not. However, due to the nature of SMTP typos, a single user may send a large number of emails in a short time, leading to potential false positives. Thus, we estimate our infrastructure receives between 415 and 5,970 SMTP typo emails per year.

Surprisingly, we received over 700 receiver typo emails per year to domains designed to catch SMTP typos (e.g., mx4hotmail.com). These emails do not appear to be spam, but the cause remains unclear.

#### Per-Domain Analysis
We examined whether some domains receive more typos than others. Out of 31 domains registered to collect receiver typo emails, 27 targeted major email providers, excluding temporary email services and bulk email services. Figure 5 shows that two domains received the majority of receiver typo emails, and 12 domains received 99% of all emails, reinforcing the idea that some typosquatting domains are significantly more effective than others.

SMTP typos are infrequent compared to receiver typos. We receive an order of magnitude fewer SMTP typo emails, suggesting that SMTP typosquatting is less profitable than receiver and reflection typos. However, there is no harm in collecting these emails on already registered domains.

The persistence of an SMTP typo for a given user is defined as the time difference between the first and last email. For 70% of users, we received only one email, making the persistence undefined (taken as zero). 83% of SMTP typos lasted less than a day, and 90% lasted less than a week, with the maximum persistence being 209 days. Long-persisting SMTP typos may be due to repeated mistakes or undetected spam. 90% of SMTP mistakes resulted in four or fewer emails to our servers.

Visual distance, target popularity, and keyboard distances are important features. Domains targeting popular email providers (e.g., gmail.com, outlook.com, hotmail.com) receive more typos. For a given target, FF-1 domains (e.g., evrizon.com, ohtlook.com, outlo0k.com) receive the most emails, indicating that visual distance is more significant than keyboard distance. Figure 5 confirms that the top two domains are DL-1 and FF-1 typos of the three most popular email providers, with low visual distance from the real domain.

We found a statistically significant correlation between the popularity of the target domain and the number of reflection and receiver typo emails received. This is expected, as the popularity of the target domain outweighs other attributes.

#### Sensitive Information and Attachments
Figure 6 shows the types of sensitive information received in true typo emails. Yopmail.com typo domains frequently receive usernames and passwords, as their emails are often used for temporary registrations.

Figure 7 shows the distribution of attachment extensions for receiver typo emails. The distributions for spam and true typo emails differ significantly. Without filtering, we received a higher proportion of file types that are easier to exploit, such as .doc, .docm, .avi, .xls, and .xlsm. We discard ZIP and RAR files during our filtering process.

Out of 109,151 unique file hashes, 323 were found in the VirusTotal database, with 304 being malicious and 17 benign. All emails containing malicious attachments were categorized as spam. Benign hashes likely do not contain personal, sensitive information, as they have been observed elsewhere in the VirusTotal database.

#### Dangers of Reflection Typos
We found that one email address at zohomil.com received many emails with CVs and job-related subjects and attachments. It appears that someone included a mistyped email address in various job postings, a variant of a reflection typo.

### SMTP Support for Typosquatting Domains

Table 4 shows the SMTP support for typosquatting domains. 22.3% of typosquatting domains cannot receive emails, 34.4% provided no information, and 43.3% support SMTP.

### The Email Typosquatting Ecosystem

We complemented our experiment with a passive analysis to estimate the occurrence and actors in the typosquatting ecosystem.

#### Methodology
We generated all possible DL-1 variations of Alexa's top one million domains on November 5, 2016, and considered the set of ctypo domains (those actually registered). We collected MX and A records for these domains on November 7, 2016. We clustered ctypos based on their DNS settings to identify any concentration in the typosquatters' infrastructure. If no MX record was found, we used the corresponding IP address for clustering.

We also checked if these domains run an SMTP server using data from zmap.io. We attempted to collect WHOIS information for all ctypo domains between December 22, 2016, and January 24, 2017, using PyWhois and Ruby Whois. While much of the information is likely fake, it can still be useful for clustering domains by owners.

#### Clustering Registrants
To cluster registrants, we used six WHOIS fields: registrant name, organization, email address, phone number, fax number, and mail address. Two domain names are considered registered by the same entity if four of the six fields match. Using a .com zone file, we identified domain name servers that serve a significantly higher proportion of typosquatting domains than expected.

Figure 8 shows the concentration among registrants who filled out at least four WHOIS fields. The top 14 registrants own 20% of typosquatting domains, and 2.3% of registrants own the majority of typosquatting domains.

Most registrants operating a large number of typosquatting domains have active SMTP servers on most of their domains. The top three registrants are companies that hold domain names for sale, which, while questionable, is not evidence of active malice. Other registrants do not focus on domain resale but operate SMTP servers, which is suspicious. The online appendix contains a list of the top typosquatting registrants.

#### Suspicious Name Servers
Several name servers are used by a significantly higher ratio of typosquatting domains compared to benign domains. The average ratio is about 4%, but some name servers exceed this, with one having a candidate typosquatting ratio as high as 89%. Many of these name servers are registered behind privacy proxies, and a majority of their domains have active SMTP servers.

#### MX Record Concentration
Many typosquatting domains support mail, and many point to a few MX records. The top eleven SMTP servers handle mail for more than one-third of typosquatting domains, and 51 for the majority. Less than 1% of SMTP servers support more than 74% of domains, indicating that a few providers could potentially defend against or be held responsible for email typosquatting.
