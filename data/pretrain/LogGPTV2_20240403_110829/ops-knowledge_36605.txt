Question: "An Android developer argues that prompting users for permission at the start of each session, rather than at install time, would enhance user security by ensuring they are aware of the permissions an app requires each time it is used. What is the strongest counterargument to this claim based on the Android security model?"
 "A": "Frequent permission prompts can lead to 'click fatigue,' where users may habitually approve all dialogs without reading, thus diminishing the effectiveness of the prompt."
 "B": "Users are unable to manage permissions after app installation, making post-install prompts the only way to control app access to protected APIs."
 "C": "Android's permission model prevents third-party applications from ever accessing certain protected features, so additional prompts are unnecessary."
 "D": "All permissions are permanently granted upon installation, and the user has no option to revoke them later, making additional prompts irrelevant."
Answer: A
