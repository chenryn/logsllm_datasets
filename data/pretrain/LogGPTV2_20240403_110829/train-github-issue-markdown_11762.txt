There appears to be an issue with the challenge located at <http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-slot-machine-to-life>. Specifically, when using the code snippet `$($('.slot')[0]).html(slotOne);` with single quotes, the validator does not accept it. The problem seems to arise from the use of single quotes instead of double quotes. 

For clarity and to ensure the code is accepted, you may want to try using double quotes as follows: 
```javascript
$($(".slot")[0]).html(slotOne);
```

This should resolve the validation issue.
