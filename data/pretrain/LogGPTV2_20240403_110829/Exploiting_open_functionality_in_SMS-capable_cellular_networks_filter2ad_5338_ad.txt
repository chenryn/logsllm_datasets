bandwidth intense attack might instead be launched from a small
zombie network.
4.2 Regional Service
Both popularity and the potential for high revenue have forced
service providers to investigate methods of increasing SMS capac-
ity in their networks. Already, a number of major industrial play-
ers [20, 32] offer solutions designed to ofﬂoad SMS trafﬁc from
the traditional SS7 phone system onto less expensive, higher band-
width IP-based networks. New SMSCs, each capable of processing
some 20,000 SMS messages per second, would help to quickly dis-
seminate the constantly increasing demand.
Advanced services including General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
and Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) promise high
speed data connections to the Internet for mobile devices. While of-
fering to alleviate multimedia trafﬁc at the SMSC and potentially
send some SMS messages, these data services are widely viewed as
complimentary to SMS and will thus not replace SMS’s function-

(and that devices are powered on).
ality in the foreseeable future [12]9. In terms of SMS delivery, all
aspects of the network are increasing available bandwidth except
the SDCCH bottleneck.
We examine a conservative attack on the cellular infrastructure
in the United States. From the United States Census in 2000, ap-
proximately 92,505 mi2[57] are considered urban. This 2.62% of
the land is home to approximately 80% of the nation’s population.
We ﬁrst model the attack by assuming that all urban areas in the
country have high-capacity sectors (8 SDCCHs per sector). This
assumption leads to the results shown below:
„ 8 SDCCH
«„ 900 msg/hr
«„ 1.7595 sectors
«
C ’
1 sector
1 SDCCH
1 mi2
(92, 505 mi2)
’ 1, 171, 890, 342 msg/hr
’ 325, 525 msg/sec
This attack would require approximately 3.8 Gbps and a nation-
wide hit-list to be successful. If the adversary is able to submit a
single message to up to ten different recipients, the requisite band-
width for the attacker drops to approximately 370 Mbps. Consid-
ering that previous distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks have crippled
websites such as Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) with gigabit per sec-
ond bandwidth, this attack on the entire cellular infrastructure is
wholly realizable through a relatively small zombie network.
4.3 Targeted Attacks
While total network degradation attacks can occur, Internet at-
tacks can be targeted. Internet driven attacks directed at speciﬁc
targets in the physical domain are not new. In 2002, anonymous in-
dividuals inundated spammer Alan Ralsky with thousands of mail-
order catalogs on a daily basis. Through the use of simple scripting
tools and a lack of mechanisms to prevent automation [15], these
individuals subscribed their target to postal mailing lists at a much
faster rate than he could possibly be removed. In so doing, Mr. Ral-
sky’s ability to receive normal mail at his primary residence was all
but destroyed.
This same attack can be applied to SMS service. While the com-
plete disruption of a user’s SMS service is dangerous, a more in-
teresting attack occurs when the adversary wishes to stop a victim
from receiving useful messages. For example, a jealous ex-lover
may wish to keep a message from being delivered; a stock trader
may want to delay updates received by competitors; an attacker
may want to keep a systems administrator from receiving a notiﬁ-
cation.
9SMS over GPRS is already in service; however, it is not the default
method of SMS delivery on GPRS-capable phones and must be
activated by the user. Furthermore, SMS over GPRS still defaults to
the standard SMS delivery mechanism when GPRS is unavailable
This attack is accomplished by ﬂooding the user with a superﬂu-
ous number of messages. This results in one of three outcomes: a
buffer somewhere overﬂows and the message is lost, the message is
delayed longer than its shelf-life10, or the user does not notice the
message due to the deluge of meaningless messages.
In many cases, an attack allowing intentional message loss is
ideal for the adversary. Mobile phones, like other embedded de-
vices, have signiﬁcant memory constraints, thereby limiting the
number of messages a phone can hold. For all but the highest-end
phones (see Section 3.1), this typically ranges from 30 to 50 mes-
sages. Once the phone can no longer receive messages, the service
provider’s network begins to buffers all subsequent messages. For
reasons of practicality, providers impose limitations on the number
of messages the network can store per user. Thus, if the adversary
can exceed this value, messages become lost.
The SMSC is not the only locus for message loss. As observed
with the Nokia 3560, when the buffer became full, any message
with content assumed to be known (any outbox message and read
messages in the inbox) were automatically deleted. While this oc-
currence was isolated to the ﬁrmware of a speciﬁc phone, the po-
tential to remotely maliciously destroy a user’s data exists.
The onslaught of large numbers of packets helps accomplish
the remaining two attack outcomes. During the testing in Sec-
tion 3.1, where 400 messages were injected to determine the size
of the SMSC buffers, the delivery of all packets took almost 90
minutes even with the constant monitoring and clearing of phone
buffers. Temporally critical messages were potentially delayed be-
yond their period of usefulness. Additionally, the use of the “Clear
Inbox” function signiﬁcantly increases the possibility of a user ac-
cidentally deleting a legitimate text message that arrived among the
attack messages.
While deleting an immense number of text messages is taxing on
the user, as described in Section 3.1, the receipt of large amounts of
data consumes signiﬁcant battery power. This leads to yet another
targeted DoS attack, a battery depletion attack.
5. THE EMAIL OF TOMORROW
In many ways, SMS messages are similar to email.
If used
correctly, they both provide a powerful means of communication.
Unfortunately, SMS inherits many of the same problems. Spam,
phishing, and viruses have all been seen with email, and should
therefore be expected with Internet originated SMS [54]. Further-
more, due to SMS’s resource constrained model, these problems
potentially worsen.
5.1 Spam
Spam [23] has plagued the Internet for a number of years. Its
realization is due to anonymity, automation, and the asymmetry be-
tween the cost of creating and processing a message. This allows a
spammer to proﬁt, even if only a small percentage of recipients ac-
tively respond. Unfortunately, spam has congested email, reducing
its usefulness.
With email seemingly saturated, spammers are constantly look-
ing for a new frontier. SMS is a logical progression; endowed with
personal qualities [11, 13], it resembles the early days of email.
Users often carry their mobile phone on their body, and the re-
ceipt of an SMS may even make one feel important. As spam-
mers exploit this new medium, this characteristic will change, and
users will begin to disregard SMS messages. This transition has al-
ready begun. In the past few years, both Europe and Asia [63] have

already experienced the intrusion of SMS spam, sometimes on a
massive scale. Unfortunately, efforts such as CAN-SPAM [58] do
nothing to mitigate the problem.
5.2 Phishing
Phishing [6, 10, 28, 29, 35] is an often more dangerous abuse of
email. Common forms include the investment emails and various
forged update requests for bank and ﬁnancial institution accounts.
Phishing need not be limited to account information. A user with
a mobile phone implicitly has an account with a wireless service
provider. Many users trust any message claiming to be from their
provider. Any text message from the service provider should be
avoided, including innocent service notiﬁcations. Once users be-
come comfortable receiving information over a medium, they are
more likely to give up sensitive information over that medium. Un-
fortunately, providers have begun to prompt for user information
using this mechanism [48].
The space limitations of SMS play important role in phishing via
text message. Figure 6 shows the ease in which a message can be
spoofed. Furthermore, once multimedia messaging service (MMS)
becomes more common, logos can be included to make messages
even more believable.
Phishing for account information is not the only way adversaries
can exploit uninformed users. Phones, in general, have been the
subject of scams for many years. The ever growing popularity of
SMS makes it a target for premium rate phone scams. An exam-
ple of this is to advertise free content (ringtones, wallpaper, etc)
via SMS, but use a high premium SMS number to distribute the
content.
5.3 Viruses
As embedded systems such as mobile phones become general
purpose computing platforms, they are subject to new vulnerabil-
ities. SMS has already seen its own “Ping of Death” [49, 17],
and viruses targeted at mobile platforms, including Cabir [25] and
Skulls [27] (both transmitted via Bluetooth), have already been ob-
served in the wild. This onslaught has prompted anti-virus compa-
nies such as F-Secure to expand their market to mobile phones [24].
F-Secure uses SMS and MMS to distribute virus deﬁnition up-
dates [24]. Unfortunately, this conduit can also be used for virus
propagation. In fact, Mabir [26], a variant of Cabir, has already
done this. By listening to incoming SMS and MMS messages, the
Mabir worm’s propagation is not restricted by the physical limita-
tions of Bluetooth. Users should expect the effects of viruses and
worms to worsen as phones become more advanced.
6. SOLUTIONS
Many of the mechanisms currently in place are not adequate to
protect these networks. The proven practicality of address spooﬁng
or distributed attacks via zombie networks makes the use of authen-
tication based upon source IP addresses an ineffective solution [9].
As demonstrated in Section 4, limiting the maximum number of
message received by an individual over a time period is also inef-
fective. Due to the tremendous earnings potential associated with
open functionality, it is also difﬁcult to encourage service providers
to restrict access to SMS messaging. Solutions must therefore take
all of these matters into consideration. The mechanisms below of-
fer both long term and temporary options for securing cellular net-
works.
6.1 Separation of Voice and Data
It is highly unlikely that the numerous connections between the
Internet and cellular networks will or can be closed by service
providers. In light of this, the most effective means of eliminating
the above attacks is by separating all voice and data communica-
tions. In so doing, the insertion of data into cellular networks will
no longer degrade the ﬁdelity of voice services.
This separation should occur in both the wired network and at
the air interface. Dedicating a carrier on the air interface for data
signaling and delivery eliminates an attacker’s ability to take down
voice communications. Dedicated data channels, however, are an
inefﬁcient use of spectrum and are therefore unattractive. Even
if this solution is implemented, the bottleneck may be pushed into
the SS7 network. More importantly, separating text messaging traf-
ﬁc onto IP or dedicated SS7 links does not prevent an attack from
overloading the air interface. Until ofﬂoading schemes [20, 32] are
fully implemented in these networks, overload controls [34] based
upon origin priority should be implemented to help shape trafﬁc.
As mentioned in Section 4.2, a partial separation has already begun
with the introduction of data services including GRPS and EDGE;
however, these networks will remain vulnerable to attack as long as
Internet-originated text messages exist.
The separation of voice and data is not enough to completely
ensure unaffected wireless communications.
In situations simi-
lar to September 11th where voice capacity is saturated, Internet-
originated SMS messages can still be used to ﬁll data channels
such that legitimate text messaging is still impossible. SMS trafﬁc
should therefore be subject to origin classiﬁcation. Text messages
originating outside of the network should be assigned low priority
on data channels. Messages originating within the phone network
should receive high priority. This solution assumes that the SMSC
is sufﬁciently protected from physical compromise by an attacker.
If this expectation does not hold, more sophisticated, distributed
mechanisms will have to be employed throughout the SS7 network.
6.2 Resource Provisioning
Many service providers have experience dealing with temporary
elevations in network trafﬁc such as ﬂash crowds. COSMOTE,
the Greek telecommunications company responsible for providing
service to the 2004 Olympic games, deployed additional base sta-
tions and an extra MSC in the area surrounding the Olympic Com-
plex [22]. This extra equipment allowed this system to success-
fully deliver over 100 million text messages during the 17 day du-
ration of the games [37]. Similarly, sporting events and large pub-
lic gatherings in the United States regularly take advantage of so-
called Cellular-on-Wheels (COW) services in order to account for
location-dependent trafﬁc spikes.
The effects of Internet-originated SMS attacks could be reduced
by increasing capacity to critical areas in a similar fashion. Unfor-
tunately, the cost of additional equipment makes this solution too
expensive. Even if a provider rationalized the expense, the elevated
provisioning merely makes DoS attacks more difﬁcult but not im-
possible. Additionally, the increased number of handoffs resulting
from reduced sector size would induce signiﬁcant strain on the net-
work core.
6.3 Rate Limitation
Due to the time and money required to realize either of the above
solutions, it is necessary to provide short term means of securing
cellular networks. These techniques harness well-known rate limi-
tation mechanisms.
On the air interface, the number of SDCCH channels allowed
to deliver text messages could be restricted. Given the addition of
normal trafﬁc ﬁlling control channels, this attack would still be ef-
fective in denying service to all but a few individuals. Additionally,
this approach slows the rate that legitimate text messages can be
delivered, potentially elevating congestion in the core of the phone
network. This approach is therefore not an adequate solution on its
own.
Because many of these attacks are heavily reliant upon accu-
rately constructed hit-lists, impeding their creation should be of the
highest priority. Speciﬁcally, all of the web interfaces should cease
returning both positive and negative acknowledgments for submit-
ted SMS messages.
Instead, a message indicating only that the
submission was being processed should be returned so as to not
permit an attacker from accurately mapping an NPA/NXX domain.
This is currently the behavior seen when a mobile-to-mobile mes-
