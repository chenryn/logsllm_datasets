Running a colab notebook (here) based in Megvi's Yolox stopped working since 2
days ago because of an issue with the _can_use_color() from pretty_printer.py.
The error is created by the exception of get_ipython().that if we print the
traceback inside _can_use_color() reports get_ipython() not found.
Please note that for the last several weeks the _can_use_color() did not raise
the exception of NameError for get_ipython, working like a charm. Might colab
have changed something?
    def _can_use_color() -> bool:
      try:
        # Check if we're in IPython or Colab
        ipython = get_ipython()  # type: ignore[name-defined]
        shell = ipython.__class__.__name__
        if shell == "ZMQInteractiveShell":
          # Jupyter Notebook
          return True
        elif "colab" in str(ipython.__class__):
          # Google Colab (external or internal)
          return True
      except NameError:
        pass
      # Otherwise check if we're in a terminal
      return sys.stdout.isatty()
