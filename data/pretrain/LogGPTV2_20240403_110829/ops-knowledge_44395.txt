User: How to mount host's directory in docker container?
Assistant: The following two methods can be used to mount the host directory in the Docker container: 1. Add the -v parameter when using the docker run command. When using the docker run command to start the container, you can use the -v parameter to specify the host directory to be mounted. For example: ``` docker run -it -v /host/path:/container/path image_name ``` Among them, /host/path is the directory on the host, /container/path is the directory in the container, and image_name is the container used The mirror image name. 2. Use the volumes attribute in the Docker Compose configuration file. When using Docker Compose to manage containers, you can specify the image used and the host directory to be mounted in the services option of the configuration file. For example: ``` version: "3" services: app: image: image_name volumes: - /host/path:/container/path ``` where /host/path is the directory on the host, and /container/path is the container directory, image_name is the name of the image used by the container. Note that this method requires Docker Compose to be installed on the host first.
