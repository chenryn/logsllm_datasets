Assistant: This log chunk shows the completion of tasks 120-123 in stage 24, as well as the assignment of tasks 1156-1158. The PythonRunner component is also logging the total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. The FileOutputCommitter component is saving the output of each task to a temporary directory in HDFS.
