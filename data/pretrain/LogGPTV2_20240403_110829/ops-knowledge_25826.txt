User:  company needs to migrate its database from MySQL to MongoDB, including data migration and application switching. Please provide an effective database migration plan and explain the specific steps.
Assistant: 1. Solution preparation 1.1 Determine the data volume and performance requirements Before migrating data between MySQL and MongDB, you need to know the size of the current database, the number of tables, and statistics related to table data, including the size of the table, the number of tables, and each column in the table data types, indexes, constraints, etc. By understanding the data volume and performance requirements, we can formulate a migration plan that suits us. 1.2 Confirm the MongoDB data structure MongoDB is a document database, while MySQL is a relational database, and the data structure models of the two are quite different. Before migrating the MySQL database to the MongoDB database, you need to have a certain understanding of the MongoDB data structure. 1.3 Select the appropriate data migration tool According to the actual situation, you can choose different data migration tools, such as the official MongoDB Connector for BI, mongodump and mongorestore tools, ETL tools (such as Talend Open Studio, Pentaho Data Integration, etc.), etc. 2. Scheme implementation 2.1 Migrate MySQL data to MongoDB a. Use mongodump tool to back up MySQL data mongodump is a backup tool officially provided by MongoDB, which can back up the data in the MongoDB instance to the local or other MongoDB clusters. First, you need to use the mysqldump tool to export MySQL data to a file: ```mysql mysqldump -u[username] -p[password] -h[hostname] [database-name] > [backup-file.sql] ``` Then, use the mongorestore tool to import the data in the MySQL backup file into MongoDB: ```mysql mongorestore --host [mongo-hostname] --port [mongo-port] -u[user] -p[password] [path -to-backup-folder] ``` b. Use ETL tools for data migration ETL tools can help us transfer MySQL data to MongoDB. The process of migrating data using ETL tools can be divided into writing ER mapping files, data extraction, data cleaning, data transformation, and loading data into the target database. 2.2 Modify the application After the data migration is completed, the data access layer of the application needs to be modified, and the original MySQL database-related operations should be changed to MongoDB-related operations. Specifically, it needs to be modified according to the structure and business logic of the application. 3. After the implementation of the program test, the correlation test is carried out on the MongoDB database to test the data integrity and availability, and at the same time, the application program is tested to ensure the normal operation and performance of the entire system.
