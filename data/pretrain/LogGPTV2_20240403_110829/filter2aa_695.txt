## The Middler – Application-Layer Rootkit

The Middler is a next-generation man-in-the-middle (MITM) tool that goes beyond the basic mechanics of protocols. It targets web applications with specific plug-ins, allowing attackers to manipulate the victim's interactions bi-directionally, altering their perceived reality.

**Key Features:**
- **Application-Specific Plug-ins:** These plug-ins are tailored to each application, enabling the attacker to abuse the user's privileges.
- **Bi-Directional Manipulation:** The attacker can modify the victim’s interaction with the application in both directions.
- **Example Scenarios:**
  - Preventing the victim from seeing an email from their girlfriend.
  - Sending emails on behalf of the victim, hiding them from the victim's sent mail, and deleting them before they are seen.

## New Features

We will be demonstrating the following new features today:
- **New Protocol Support:** Extending MITM capabilities to Voice over IP (VoIP).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** For interactive victim selection and attack.
- **Generic Session Cloning Tool:** For HTTP sessions.
- **Application-Specific Plug-ins.**
- **Performance Improvements.**
- **Collaboration with Sophsec via libPoison.**

## Adding Protocols

Initially, The Middler targeted only HTTP-based applications. We could perform tricks like hooking the `onkeypress()` handler for authentication forms, capturing passwords one key at a time. However, feedback from Def Con attendees encouraged us to expand to non-web applications and protocols, starting with VoIP.

**Why VoIP?**
- SIP, the dominant VoIP protocol, shares many similarities with HTTP.
- Example Request:
  ```
  INVITE sip:user@example.com SIP/2.0
  Via: SIP/2.0/UDP 192.168.1.1:5060;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds
  From: "User One" <sip:user@example.com>;tag=1928301774
  To: "User Two" <sip:user2@example.com>
  Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710@9cfbf42ea536
  CSeq: 314159 INVITE
  Contact: <sip:user@example.com>
  Content-Type: application/sdp
  Content-Length: 142
  ```

**Security Concerns:**
- **Cleartext Protocol:** SIP often transmits data in cleartext.
- **Digest Authentication:** While SIP uses challenge-response authentication with MD5 hashes, most implementations do not use passwords after session authentication, making them vulnerable.

## Hacking VoIP

The Middler's current VoIP attacks include:
- **Call Redirection:** Redirect inbound calls to the attacker's phone.
- **Caller ID Alteration:** Change the caller ID to confuse the victim.
- **Eavesdropping and Audio Manipulation:** Listen in on calls and alter the audio.
- **Phone Unregistration:** Remove the phone's registration to prevent it from receiving calls.

**Examples:**
- **Redirect Incoming Calls:** Selectively redirect some incoming calls.
- **Alter Incoming Caller ID:** Change caller ID details without breaking the call.
- **Eavesdrop and Alter:** Eavesdrop on calls and mix in audio to impersonate the victim.
- **Unregister the Phone:** Stop the phone from receiving calls by unregistering it.

## More New Features

- **GUI for Victim Selection and Attack:** A graphical interface to carefully choose and target victims.
- **Generic Session Cloning Tool for HTTP:** Clone any user's session.
- **App-Specific Plug-ins:** Tailored for various applications.
- **Performance Improvement.**
- **Collaboration with Sophsec via libPoison.**

**GUI Mode:**
- Helps in selecting victims based on their online identities (webmail, social networking, etc.).
- Allows for careful targeting and manipulation of the victim's online presence.

**Demo: GUI**
- Demonstrates the GUI in action, identifying potential targets on a network.

**Impersonating the User:**
- Clone the user’s session to perform actions in parallel, unbeknownst to the user.
- Perform actions such as reading and deleting messages, adding false messages, and creating and abusing trust relationships.

**Web Applications with Plug-Ins:**
- Supports attacks on social networking sites (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) and web-based email portals (Yahoo Mail, Gmail).
- Exploits the fact that these sites often revert to cleartext post-authentication.

**Cloning Arbitrary Sessions:**
- The Middler can clone any user’s session, making it easier to impersonate the user.

**More Attacks on the Browser:**
- Inject JavaScript, IFRAMEs, HTTP response code redirects, HTML META redirects, and other content.
- Gain subtle control of the browser by forcing it to visit malicious sites or exploit frameworks.

## Why Does This All Work?

Many companies and developers do not understand the security implications of leaving post-login sessions unencrypted. This allows attackers to impersonate users and launch various attacks.

**Example:**
- LinkedIn reverts to a cleartext URL after login, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks.

**Banks:**
- Some banks encrypt everything post-login but serve the initial login form in cleartext, making them vulnerable to page modification attacks.

**CSRF and Race Conditions:**
- Exploiting race conditions and CSRF vulnerabilities on hotel networks to intercept and manipulate banking sessions.

**Demo: Hooking onKeyPress()**
- Demonstration of how to hook `onKeyPress()` events to capture keystrokes in real-time.

**Knowing Where the User Has Been:**
- Read the browser history and inject JavaScript into open pages to gain additional control.
