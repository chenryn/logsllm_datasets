The issue had already been fixed in libuv/libuv@`1d8332f`, which calls either
uv__epoll_wait  
or uv__epoll_pwait, depending on availability [libuv/libuv#308].
What is the current status of migrating Julia to upstream libuv?
Switching sooner than later would help avoid duplicate work such as in this
case.
