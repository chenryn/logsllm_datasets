Subject: Forwarding Debian Bug #807701 - Julia Build Failure on arm64

Dear Julia Maintainers,

I am writing to bring to your attention Debian bug #807701, which was reported by Edmund Grimley Evans on December 11, 2015. The issue concerns a build failure of Julia on the arm64 architecture.

**Details:**
- **Build Status:** [https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=julia&suite=sid](https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=julia&suite=sid)
- **Error Message:**
  ```
  signal (6): Aborted
  gsignal at /lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (unknown line)
  Aborted
  ```

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the failure appears to be the absence of the `epoll_wait` system call on arm64, where only `epoll_pwait` is available. A patch has already been implemented in libuv (commit `1d8332f`), which conditionally calls either `uv__epoll_wait` or `uv__epoll_pwait` based on availability. This patch is referenced in [libuv/libuv#308].

**Request:**
Could you please provide an update on the current status of migrating Julia to the upstream version of libuv? Transitioning to the latest libuv version as soon as possible would help avoid redundant work and ensure compatibility with various architectures, including arm64.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
Peter
