### Inability to Determine the Exact Software Service Pack
Traditional active operating system fingerprinting tools often fail to identify the specific service pack version installed on a target machine. For example, they may detect that a machine is running Microsoft Windows 2000 but cannot determine which service pack, if any, is installed.

### Impact of Fingerprinting Tests on Overall Results
Some fingerprinting tests have a more significant impact on the overall accuracy of the results compared to others. If these critical tests fail, the quality of the results can be significantly degraded, especially for tools using strict signature matching. Tools that use a fuzzy logic approach may be less affected, but their results can still be impacted.

### Example: Xprobe2 Scan
```bash
spanion:~ # xprobe2 -v x.x.x.x

### Network Devices and Packet Alteration
Network devices such as firewalls can alter packet field values, affecting the accuracy of fingerprinting results. This can lead to false results or no results at all if the packets are dropped by the firewall.

### Firewalled Target Systems
Probed systems may be protected by firewalls. If the fingerprinting tool relies on specific packet types that are blocked by the firewall, the quality of the results can be severely degraded.

### Use of Malformed Packets
Using malformed packets can cause filtering devices to drop the packets, degrading the quality of the results. Additionally, malformed packets can cause some TCP/IP stacks to crash.

### Alteration of TCP/IP Stack Behavior
System administrators can alter the behavior of TCP/IP stacks by changing tunable parameters or applying patches. If a fingerprinting tool relies on these parameters, the results may be inaccurate if the parameters are altered.

### Quality of Signature Databases
The quality of the results from an active operating system fingerprinting tool depends on the quality of its signature database. If the database contains incorrect signatures, the results will be inaccurate.

### Inability to Identify Underlying Architecture
Most active operating system fingerprinting tools can identify the operating system but not the underlying hardware platform. This information is crucial for tools like Nessus, which perform vulnerability assessments and network inventory.

### Scalability
An effective fingerprinting tool should be able to scan large networks without overwhelming network devices. It must balance the scan rate with the network's capacity to avoid denial of service conditions.

### Control of Fingerprinting Modules
The ability to control which fingerprinting modules are executed is important. The intent of the scan (e.g., malicious vs. non-malicious) influences the choice of modules. An ideal tool should adapt its scanning tactics based on the network conditions.

### Remedy: Enhanced Functionality in Xprobe2
To improve the effectiveness of Xprobe2, we added a TCP module based on the TCP 3-way handshake. This module examines parameters in both the IP and TCP layers, providing a more accurate and comprehensive fingerprint.

### Best of Breed TCP/IP Stack Fingerprinting Techniques
We selected a TCP-based fingerprinting test that has a significant impact on the overall results. This test uses multiple parameters and provides real added value, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the fingerprinting process.
