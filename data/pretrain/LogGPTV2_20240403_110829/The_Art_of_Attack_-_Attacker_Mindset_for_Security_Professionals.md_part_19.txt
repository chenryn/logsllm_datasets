Our team does not go on a job without extensive OSINT, and we go
through that OSINT with a fine-t ooth comb daily on the run-u p to
make sure we’ve missed nothing and that everything we are using
from it is in scope. We allow that OSINT to be ripped apart with
no form of ownership attached to it. There’s no room for personal
emotion in OSINT on this level. If the intel isn’t good, then it needs
to be scrapped. This means that the collector has lost time and the
engagement has lost time. That’s the nature of OSINT. If there was
a perfect way to perform OSINT or any type of intelligence tech-
nique whilst ensuring you were on the right path, then companies
probably wouldn’t need us.
OSINT is our most valuable tool; it often has no cost but that
of time, which, overall, is well spent. The thing that non-a ttacker/
members of the public often don’t understand is that information
doesn’t have to be secret to be valuable. What most of us in the infor-
mation security community call operational security, or OPSEC, the
public deems almost valueless as private information. People pub-
lish dates of birth, hobbies, interests, and vacation times as if they
can’t be used to help break into their bank account, house, or other
accounts. Businesses publish updates on their sites constantly in a
bid to keep their customer base informed, not always realizing that
an attacker with a finely tuned AMs is easily able to use that infor-
mation against them. Given how many of us use the Internet and, in
particular, forums, online communities, and social media sites, we
can cheerfully and optimistically approach outlets confident there’s
an employee within our target company who has posted something
valuable. But do note that not all online communities and forums
162 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
gets indexed by search engines, so you may have to independently
search these types of sites based on previously collected informa-
tion on your target to see if they have posted there.
Taking advantage of information found can be as simple as
asking for help for a product they use. Searching job postings from
a company may also be advantageous. Such postings may ask for
candidates with special skill sets, such as “expertise in Python.”
None of this is groundbreaking stuff. You can read more about this
topic in many books dedicated to OSINT (see the notes section for
some of those books). What’s novel is looking at OSINT through the
lens of AMs.
There is a technical pursuit of OSINT, too. I recommend
tools like SpiderFoot, Recon- NG, Google Earth Pro, and Sherlock
and Maltego.
In addition to scanning web page content, SpiderFoot looks
at HTTP headers, which can ultimately produce OS and web soft-
ware names and version numbers. This information can prove vital,
should you find out that an older version of Windows, Apache, or
PHP is being used and exposed on the Internet.
There are many OSINT databases, which makes it possible to
search a software version against a known vulnerability database,
and then work out the details of leveraging the security hole. Recon-
NG is a favorite of mine. It’s a full-f eatured web recon framework. It
has plenty of features, such as domain name discovery and creden-
tials gathering, to repository scrapping with additional integrations
like Masscan.
Maltego is both a data management and visualization tool as
well as an OSINT tool. It’s quite complex and cannot, in my expe-
rience, be learned intuitively. It is extremely powerful, though. It
offers two types of recon options: infrastructural and personal.
Infrastructural recon deals with the domain, covering DNS infor-
mation such as name servers, mail exchangers, zone transfer tables,
DNS- to- IP mapping, and related information. Personal recon deals
with information such as email addresses, phone numbers, social
networking profiles, and even mutual friend connections. It is a
very sophisticated tool.
Sometimes, even a technical pursuit can start with OSINT and
will maintain a pure level of AMs throughout. This is why OSINT
Information Processing in Practice 163
pays off. I won’t say you need to devote weeks to OSINT, but even a
few minutes can count when you don’t have much more time than
that to spend.
Finally, there will always be people who leave the rest of us in
the dust when it comes to searches, dorking, and using the tools.
Being able to collect OSINT proficiently is a valuable skill to have.
However, anyone can learn to do it. That sort of technical technique
can be taught if you want to learn. The bulk of AMs, as applied to
OSINT, however, lies in one area: the ability to analyze informa-
tion for its value. This can only be done by applying everything you
find to the objective and evaluating it through that lens. But more
than that, applying AMs to OSINT means the ability to twist that
information to fit the objective. How a piece of information gets you
closer to an objective won’t always be clear, but with a finely tuned
AMs, you can see the value in most information. In other words,
you must learn to critically evaluate information and apply it (or
disregard it) based on your objective. Instead of being burdened by
the amount of information you will collect, you will be able to rank
it as you come across it. This concept may seem abstract, so I will
supplement it with an example.
Let’s start with an easy task. Say I want to write a spearphish
and all the information I have on the target is his email address
and that he went to Colgate University. I can write a phish from
the university asking him to give a commencement speech or cit-
ing something about the alumni, or even asking him to be part of
a mentor program, which I could tailor to his job if I knew it. It’s a
spearphish, so it would have to be quite warm and personal, using
his name, injecting it with any other relevant details, or using a
sense of familiarity.
Even easier, if his CV (curriculum vitae) is online, whether it
be on LinkedIn or on his own site, it will likely list his “expertise,”
which I can bend to my objective. It might have metadata attached
that will give me insight to the type of system he is using, which
I might be able to leverage in a seemingly technical phish.
If this target has no information available online but a family
member does, I would potentially be able to use this. For instance,
knowledge about a vacation might allow me to email as the hotelier
about the bill or items left behind if the scope permitted and if it
was aligned with the objective.
164 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Another thing that will need careful analysis when considering
information directly from the target is the use of language. I can
extract information from social opinion to emotion by studying his
use of language, i.e., how articulate and balanced his communica-
tion seems, as well as intensifiers and indications of his stress level.
I can thus begin to build a picture of my target that I can work with.
This last point illustrates one of the shortcomings of OSINT: misin-
formation. Operating off false information is harder than operating
off no information.
OSINT is valuable and becoming more so every day because
now everyone is interested in the findings and has learned to apply
them to their role and business interests from IT and security to
boardrooms. This is because OSINT is effectively the start of the
foothold. The beginnings of gaining access to a company is gaining
information about it, and if you can gain enough information to
list assets, operations, to profile a company accurately or to circum-
vent security and other defenses, then you come that much closer to
achieving your final objective—whatever that may be.

Let’s move to a slightly harder task. Imagine just having one
photo with little information, but it places a target at a location.
The poster of this image, Julia Bayer, simply asks that you work out
where the photo was taken (see Figure 7.10).
Let’s say I know the target lives in Berlin and looking at her online
profiles, this seems easy to infer. I queried Wikipedia and “churches
in Berlin.” Without knowing if this image was that of a “former
place church” or a current “place of worship”, I clicked on the latter
and got to what turned out to be the correct list (Figure 7.11).
The spire from the first picture (Figure 7.10) strongly resem-
bles one from the Wikipedia page. The name given for it is
Sophienkirche.

A quick Google Maps search shows trees and surroundings
(Figure 7.12).
This gives me hope I am on the right track.
Then I try Google Street View but have no luck. Probably user
error. So, I return to the Google Image search. I’ve found photos
of the church, which are a match for the one posted by Julia (Fig-
ure 7.10). I can match the photos by the windows, spire, and roof
color from Figure 7.10 with Figure 7.13 (below) for a quick pairing.

In a darker example, here’s a Europol crowdsourced, brilliant
example of geolocation, which I read about on Bellingcat and sub-
sequently asked for permission to retell in this book.
Since 2017, Europol has been crowdsourcing intel and insight
for their “Stop Child Abuse— Trace an Object” campaign.
Europol shared new images via their website and Twitter on
October 15, 2018. A few photographs were taken outside and made
it possible to use geolocation because of recognizable landmarks.
Two of these photos, taken from a roof of a building, show concrete
buildings and were presumably taken in an Asian city (Figure 7.14).
The photos are heavily censored due to the sensitivity of the mate-
rial. Europol’s investigators needed the location of the photos to be
able to trace a child abuser and save the victim.
Information Processing in Practice 167
The photos don’t seem to contain many recognizable land-
marks. There’s no text or signage displayed on the buildings, and
the concrete structures don’t reveal much of anything.
Twitter user “Bo” contacted Bellingcat and mentioned the archi-
tecture showed similarity to the city of Shenzhen in southern China.
Bellingcat responded to Europol’s tweet with this information and
included a photo of similar architecture and an overlay image of the
two photos, noting the blue road sign and a structure similar to a
satellite receiver on top of a building shown in the photos.
Figure 7.14 Two photos from an Asian city
A short while later, Twitter user Olli Enne from Finland geolo-
cated the exact location of the photos in the Bao’an district of Shen-
zhen. According to Olli, the images were taken from the roof of a
building with coordinates 22.722917, 114.053194. He showed sev-
eral buildings and a hill in the photos that matched the buildings
visible in satellite imagery. Also, a view line across a building with
a blue roof to a building with arch shaped windows in the distance
lines up with the view line in satellite imagery.
168 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Figure 7.15 Map showing satellite imagery
In later tweets, Olli explained that he searched in Shenzhen and
other major cities in China for several hours (note the timeframe—n ot
everything you search for will take just minutes of work). You will need
curiosity and persistence in abundance at times. Over this time period,
he was looking for little green hills and road shapes, and he drew a map
of how the area would look in satellite imagery (Figure 7.15).
The geolocation of the photos could not be immediately verified
by Bellingcat because matching the buildings in the photos to the
buildings visible in satellite imagery was difficult. However, thanks
to Baidu Maps, a Chinese web mapping system, Bellingcat was able
to verify that Olli’s geolocation was a perfect match (Figure 7.16).
A Google Earth 3D view of the building the photos were taken
from shows the same mountains. In particular, the shape of the
mountain on the left side of the photos is very similar to the shape
of the mountains in the 3D view (Figure 7.17). A smaller mountain
with a relatively high peak is more difficult to spot, but following a
view line in the photos from the location where they were taken in
the direction of that mountain shows the same buildings in the 3D
view that are visible in the photos in that view line. Also, the partly
visible small green hill at the end of the road is clearly visible in
Google’s 3D view.

The Bellingcat article goes on to talk about many more interest-
ing and relevant items in its article, including more initial research
and how they estimated the year the photographs were taken. You

170 THE LAWS AND SKILLS

This example steps away a little from the OSINT and type
of recon I started out describing, but it demonstrates the power of
some of the most important intel types we can use.
Summary
• Good reconnaissance is critical to any operation.
• In general, reconnaissance is the bulk of an attack. This is why
the first, second, and fourth laws of AMs used in conjunction
are so critical.
• All of the information you gather has to further your attain-
ment of the objective, and it will help you with law 3 (never
break pretext).
• There are technical components to OSINT, especially if you
want to stay anonymous.
Key Message
OSINT is only as useful as your mind makes it. AMs is taking in
information and applying it to an objective. You have to be able to
break information down into critical chunks and perform further
searches from there.

Attack Strategy
B
efore we get into the meat of attack strategy, I want to take a
moment to round up the mindset. The Attacker Mindset is
formed by cognitive skills applied to four laws. The mark of
a good attacker is the ability to come into contact with information,
weaponize the valuable information and disregard the rest, and
then leverage it in an attack. Sometimes the information will come
to you already weaponized; other times, you will have to mold and
shape it into something to be leveraged. Notably, you do not need
the skills to understand the laws. You do not need to know or care
about the laws to have or use the skills. It is, however, the use of
both in tandem that forms the mindset.
The skills you need are curiosity and persistence, which are inter-
dependent, since one will not pay off without the other. The other
skills are information processing, mental agility, and self-a wareness.
Mental agility is a fancy way of saying you must be able to adapt the
information to the situation in which you find yourself. Applying
your self-a wareness as an attacker results in leaving someone feeling
a certain way, which is most often accomplished by your demeanor,
your choice of words, your body language, and your general way of
being. All in all, it’s knowing what you have and how to leverage it
for the objective. It’s knowing when to push and when to pull when
evaluating your own strengths and deficiencies.
173
174 TOOLS AND ANATOMY
The laws that these skills are applied to are as follows:
1. Start with the end in mind.
2. Gather, weaponize, and leverage information.
3. Never break pretext.
4. Every move you make should be in the interest of the
objective.
Law 1 means that you are always thinking ahead; you need to be
able to think far enough ahead to the end goal, to be able to keep it
in your mind, and know what your short-t erm goals are. Then you
must employ laws 2, 3, and 4 to reach the end.
Law 2 states that you gather, weaponize, and leverage informa-
tion as a means to that end. Law 2 takes practice, but information
is everywhere. Used in tandem with curiosity and persistence, you
will see results.
Law 3 means you are never yourself. You can switch “charac-
ters” or pretexts when it serves you, not just because you are bored
or want to show off your acting range. A pretext is a way to disguise
yourself as a threat. It’s a narrative you’re presenting that allows
you to be exactly where you are, doing exactly what you need to do.
Some pretexts will let you do this overtly, whereas others require
a more covert approach. For instance, posing as an office cleaner
won’t get you in the server room, but it might get you deep enough
into the building.
Law 4 states that every move you make after deciding the objec-
tive of law 1 will benefit it. Everything you do must get you closer to
the objective. If you need to take a new route because the one you
tried is a dead end, do it. If you have to sacrifice entry one day due
to new intel but wait to try again the next day, you should do so. In
any attack, convenience isn’t a factor or concern.
Attacks always have a gain in mind. The attacker is only con-
cerned with how to achieve that objective in the most efficient way.
