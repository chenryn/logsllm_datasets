is far enough outside a television station’s service area to not cause harmful interference.  The 
proposed detection threshold level of -116 dBm clearly does not provide this level of 
protection.29
28 The TV viewer will avoid locations where the TV signal is not adequate (for example, using 
an indoor antenna in a basement location) because the TV receiver will not operate properly.
The user of the TV band device, however, has no such incentive to avoid poor TV reception 
locations inside the TV contour.  In fact, the TV band device would actually provide the user 
with more channels and capacity and the user would be unaware of the fact that the device was 
causing interference to TV reception.        
29 The detection threshold of -116 dBm is referenced to a 0 dBi gain antenna.   For the purposes 
of this example, assume that the -116 dBm detection threshold is measured over the 6 MHz TV 
channel.  There are therefore actual physical differences in the “receive” system used by the 
unlicensed device and a TV receiver.  The -116 dBm received by a TV band device is equivalent 
to a  -99 dBm signal received by a TV receiver taking into account the difference in antenna gain 
and height between the TV and the device operation.  (There is a 10 dB difference in antenna 
gain between a typical outdoor TV antenna and the 0 dBi sensing antenna required under the 
proposed rules (0 dBi vs. 10 dBi).  There is also a 7 dB difference in the height of the antennas (6 
feet vs. 30 feet)).  The question then becomes can a TV signal of -99 dBm or less occur within or 
close to the protected TV contour?   The answer is clearly yes. In fact, in limited measurements 
taken in 1998 by MSTV of WETA’s coverage, three outdoor sites within the protected contour
(located 36.4, 37.8, and 42.9 miles from the transmitter) were found to have signal levels less 
than -99 dBm or less than -116 dBm referenced to a 0 dBi antenna.  Therefore, a TV band device 
sensing at -116 dBm at these three locations would have failed to protect TV viewers.  In 
addition, at many sites, the signal level was only a few decibels above the -99 dBm level.  Since 
the measurement procedure called for locating the “maximum” signal level at each location, it is 
highly likely that the “average” signal level at these locations would be well below the -99 dBm 
level.  It should also be noted that all of these measurements were taken “outdoors” at sites 
where reception was expected to be successful.  In fact, when the TV band devices were assumed 
to be located indoors, where the TV signal was attenuated by only 10 dB, the analysis showed 38

In addition, the sensing level must be low enough to protect against the “hidden node” 
problem, whereby the TV band device is located behind an obstruction, such as a building or a 
hill, which prevents it from receiving the television signal.  If this occurs, the channel would 
appear “vacant” to the TV band device’s receiver and the device would therefore transmit, even 
though the device is well inside the service area of a co-channel television station.
The sensing proposals erroneously assume that a predetermined detection threshold level 
(whether -116 dBm or otherwise) will guarantee that the unlicensed device will be sufficiently 
outside the protected television station’s service area, and thus the TV band device will not cause 
interference.  In fact, as discussed above, signal detection and sensing alone cannot accurately 
predict location.30  As there may be locations within the service area where the signal level may 
be below the designated sensing detection level, the current proposed -116 dBm sensing level 
will be ineffective at preventing interference.  As outlined in Section V, below, additional 
protections are necessary to prevent co-channel interference.   
2.
The Comparison Of The Use Of Spectrum Sensing In The 5 GHz 
Band With The Current Situation Is Misplaced. 
The FNPRM, and other commenting parties, have misused the fact that spectrum sensing 
has preliminarily been used to prevent interference in the 5 GHz band, as support for the 
locations well within WETA’s protected contour.   In these locations, the signal level received by 
a TV band device would have been less than -116 dBm and sensing would have failed, resulting 
in significant interference to surrounding TV viewers. Additional measurements are currently 
being conducted in the Washington/Baltimore area, and will be submitted in the reply phase of 
this proceeding.  Preliminary results support previous findings.  
30 Proponents of a sensing approach posit that by using very sensitive receivers, sensing will 
effectively prevent interference.  While it is potentially possible to determine a sensing level that 
will ensure that low power devices are operating outside of the contour, this is highly 
impractical.  If the detection level is set low enough to actually provide protection to DTV 
viewers, the detection level will be well below the ambient “noise floor.”  The result will be that 
all spectrum will appear occupied and the detector will never find unused or unoccupied 
spectrum.

proposition that spectrum sensing alone will be effective in preventing interference in the 
television band.31  This comparison confuses the problem of transmitter detection (for which 
sensing is relatively effective) with the real issue of protecting television reception from 
interference (for which sensing is woefully inadequate). While the FNPRM acknowledges in 
passing the differences between the effectiveness of sensing in the 5 GHz band and in the 
broadcast spectrum,32 it mistakenly argues that the problem can be fixed with a more sensitive 
detection threshold.33  In fact, it is far easier to use sensing technologies to protect a 5 GHz radar 
receiver than consumers’ DTV reception. 
First, significant differences in the location of the receivers indicate that sensing will be 
markedly less effective in the television context in terms of preventing interference.  In the 5 
GHz band, the radar receiver to be protected is co-located with the radar transmitter whose 
emissions can be “sensed,” making protection of the radar receiver relatively easy and 
straightforward technically.  In contrast, television receivers are not co-located with the 
television transmitter, but rather are located throughout a television station’s service area.  
Consequently, there is no signal that can be sensed to tell an unlicensed device how close it is to 
a television receiver or viewer.
Second, unlike broadcast signals, which are weak, radar signals are strong; as a result, 
radar signals are easier to detect.  Furthermore, the antennas for unlicensed devices at 5 GHz are 
small, efficient and have a uniform performance across the 5 GHz band.  In the broadcast arena, 
on the other hand, building a small, efficient and practical antenna to detect “occupied channels”

that operates with a uniform performance across all television channels is extremely difficult and 
complex. This is because an antenna’s ability to receive a transmitted signal is related to the 
wavelength of the signal received, which thus impacts the necessary size of the physical antenna.
At 5 GHz, the wavelength of the signal is less than about 2.5 inches, and therefore, a very 
effective sensing antenna can be made in a small physical space.  In the television spectrum, 
however, there are three separate frequency bands that extend across both the VHF and UHF 
region of the spectrum.  The wavelength size can vary from 17 inches in the upper UHF band to 
18 feet at VHF bands.34 Consequently, even a poorly functioning antenna for an unlicensed 
device in the television band would need to be significantly larger than an antenna at 5 GHz.
Finally, in contrast to television receivers, radar systems are robust and can effectively 
deal with interference. Thus, errors in detection and inadvertent unlicensed operation do not 
result in significant degradation of the radar system, whereas any “low power” operation in the 
television band caused by errors in detection will result in widespread interference to viewers.
Therefore, detection by TV band devices must be correct all of the time to avoid harmful 
interference.  
In sum, there is currently no practical sensing level that will guarantee accuracy in all 
situations.  The Commission must therefore avoid utilizing sensing as the only means of 
preventing co-channel interference in the broadcast spectrum and should ensure that protection is 
provided through the use of appropriate D/U ratios and the implementation of non-sensing 
means, such as geo-location and professional installation, designed to maintain required 
separation distances to the TV contour.   
34 The wavelength of UHF Channel 51 is about 17 inches and the wavelength of VHF channel 2
is about 18 feet.  The formula is wavelength (meters)  = 300/f in MHz.

Any Operation of a TV Band Device On A Television Station’s First Adjacent 
Channel Will Harm Reception.
In addition to the harms of co-channel operation, any operation of TV band devices on a 
television station’s first adjacent channel will also cause severe and unacceptable interference to 
licensed television services.  The FNPRM, however, fails to prevent such operation and thus 
leaves consumers’ vulnerable. 
 The following analysis demonstrates the harms of adjacent channel operations. Three 
signal levels (from moderately strong to weak signal conditions) are considered for DTV 
reception and a free space propagation model as suggested by the Commission is assumed for the 
interfering TV band device.35  Using the same adjacent channel protections proposed by the 
Commission in its initial NPRM,36 the following table shows the impact of personal/portable 
devices operating at 100 mW and at 400 mW: 37

As indicated by the above chart, DTV viewers, even hundreds of meters from a 100 mW 
TV band device operating on a first adjacent channel, will experience harmful interference.  The 
35 This is consistent with the Commission’s recommendation to use free space propagation 
calculations for distances up to 1.5 kilometers.  See Initial White Spaces NPRM at ¶ 31, note 50.  
36 See Id. at ¶¶ 29-31.
37 400 mW is the proposed maximum output power including antenna gain for personal/portable 
unlicensed devices.

Page 17 of 40 
interference concerns are even greater for the higher powered 400 mW devices which may cause 
interference to DTV services for over a kilometer.38   
Since received signal strength will vary throughout the TV station’s service area and will 
depend on the type of antenna a viewer is using for reception, there is no practical way to predict 
or avoid this type of interference.  As significant interference will occur, even with lower power 
personal/portable devices, it is clear that the Commission must exclude all TV band devices from 
operating within the contour of a first adjacent channel.  IEEE 802.22 has reached the same 
conclusion in its studies: devices should not be allowed to operate within a first adjacent 
channel.39
Further, while protection of the first adjacent channel is most important, it is noteworthy 
that TV band devices may also cause interference to the second and third adjacent channels as 
well as to channels N+7, N+14 and N+15.  The FNPRM makes no effort to address these 
interference concerns, which must be addressed before any TV band device can be allowed in the 
broadcast spectrum.

CRC TV Receiver Tests Demonstrate Interference From TV Band Devices On 
Adjacent Channels, Taboo Channels, As Well As Additional Interference 
Caused By Multiple Devices.
To assist the Commission’s effort in testing television receivers,  MSTV funded 
laboratory testing by CRC of five VSB receivers to determine, and quantify, their interference 
38 See Exhibit A for calculation of the keep-out distance for a 4 W TV band device. 
39 See Ex Parte Presentation of IEEE 802.22, ET Docket No. 04-186 (filed Oct. 3, 2005) (“IEEE-
802.22 Presentation”).  IEEE 802.22 is responsible for developing standards for operating 
Wireless LANs within the TV bands. In October 2005, it submitted an ex parte filing with the 
FCC to report on its activities and findings to date.  The report concluded, among other findings, 
that unlicensed systems should not operate within a co- and first adjacent channel contour of a 
DTV station.  IEEE 802.22 has also provided the Commission with numbers indicating the 
appropriate distances for these devices to be operating outside of the contour.

Page 18 of 40 
performance.40  The five receivers included a current DTV model, purchased specifically for 
these tests, as well as other current and recent DTV models.  The study is included in Exhibit B.  
Listed below is a summary of the findings: 
1.
Interference Performance Can Vary Significantly Across DTV 
Receivers And Interference Mechanisms.
The results of the CRC tests indicate that interference performance can vary substantially 
across different DTV receivers and for different interference mechanisms.  That is, there was no 
single DTV receiver that provided the best or worst performance across all tests and 
measurements.  For example, receiver #5 (as described more fully in Exhibit B) was one of the 
better performing receivers in the weak signal single interferer case.  In the higher signal single 
interferer cases, however, it was one of the worst performing receivers and was an average 
performer in the case of multiple interfering signals. 
This finding suggests that in developing the appropriate D/U protection ratios, the 
Commission should consider selecting a value for each mechanism that is met by all measured 
TV receivers and therefore protects all TV viewers.  The median measured receiver values for 
each mechanism should not be used.  Such an approach lacks any technical justification, 
especially with regard to developing protections for a Part 15 unlicensed TV band device.
First, there is no actual measured DTV receiver with this performance; thus, the use of median 
values would actually protect less than half of the TV measured receivers from all interference 
mechanisms.   
Second, the interference “cliff effect” mechanism for DTV makes the use of median 
values unacceptable and technically unsuitable.  While median values have been used in certain 
40 CRC tested all of the receivers on all adjacent and taboo channels from first adjacent (N ±1) to 
N ±15.  No co-channel interference tests were conducted.
Comments of MSTV and NAB 
Jan. 31, 2007 
ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 19 of 40 
instances for analog television receivers, such receivers degrade gradually and a receiver that is 
one or two dB under the median performance will merely display a slightly degraded picture.  
Due to the “cliff effect” for DTV, a DTV receiver that is one or two dB under the median 
performance ceases to display any picture and sound.   The premise and rationale of this 
rulemaking has been to prevent harmful interference to TV viewers and other licensed 
operations.  This cannot be technically accomplished with the use of median performance values.  
Third, the sample size, and the measurements taken to date, are too small and 
uncorrelated to actual receiver population.  The Commission must select values met by all 
measured receivers, and provide some margin above those values to account for differences in 
modulation schemes used by TV band devices, in order to protect TV viewers from potentially 
multiple interfering signals from these devices.   
2.
Interference On First Adjacent Channels Is A Serious Concern And 
Therefore First Adjacent Use Should Be Avoided Within A TV 
Station’s Protected Contour. 
Based on the CRC measurements, the lowest D/U ratios or greatest protection of DTV 
receivers is required on the first adjacent channels.  For some receivers, the upper adjacent is the 
most critical, while for other receivers the lower adjacent is most important.  CRC calculated the 
radius of interference for each receiver assuming that the interfering device is operating at 100 
mW with a 6 dBi transmitting antenna gain.41  These interference distances are shown in the 
CRC Report attached as Exhibit B.  All of the adjacent channel interference distances were 
substantially greater than 10 meters.  In some cases, for example, in the case where the desired 
41 In the initial NPRM, the Commission proposed this level for personal/portable unlicensed 
devices. See Initial White Spaces NPRM at App B.  In its subsequent FNPRM, the Commission 
has proposed that TV band devices can operate up to 4 watts. See First R&O and FNPRM at 
App. B.

signal was only 7 dB above the value at the edge of contour, the interference distances for the 5 
DTV receivers varied from 60.9 meters to 229 meters.  Moreover, the presence of a second 
interfering signal further lowered the required protection levels by as much as 4.5 dB; thereby 
further increasing these distances.
3.
Interference On Second And Third Adjacent Channels Is Very 
Problematic As Well As Operations On N+7 And On “Image” 
Frequencies N+14 And N+15.
The CRC measurement results suggest that operation of TV band devices on second and 
third adjacent channels could also be problematic. The single interfering signal tests show that 
TV device operation on second and third adjacent channels would cause interference at distances 
well beyond the 10 meters.  For example, a TV band device operating at only 400 mw, would 
cause interference to receiver 5 at a distance of  43.5 meters on the lower second adjacent 
channel and 17.7 meters on the lower third adjacent channel. For single interfering signals, 
operation on the second adjacent channel was also found to be worse than the third adjacent 
channel.
The CRC measurement results also suggest that operation of TV bands devices on the 
fourteen and fifteen channels above could be problematic. The data demonstrates that, depending 
on the design of the TV receiver and the filtering of the undesired signal, an interference radius 
of 100 meters or more is possible. 
In the case of multiple interfering signals, operation on the upper and lower third adjacent 
channel was found to be even worse.  For example, in the case of interfering signals on both the 
upper and lower third adjacent channel, the interference performance of receivers 3 and 4 are 
reduced by 17.0 dB and 16.0 dB respectively and the resultant D/U ratios are reduced to -26.6 dB 
and -28 dB.  These values indicate that TV band device operation on these channels within the

protected contour would not protect TV viewers with DTV receivers that exhibit similar 
performance characteristics. 
4.
Multiple Interfering Signals Will Reduce Interference Performance 
And D/U Protection Ratios Of DTV Receivers. 
The CRC tests also considered the effects to TV receivers when two interfering signals 
occurred on two different channels.  As shown, the introduction of a second interfering signal on 
another channel, even at a level that is half the power (-3 dB) of the first interferer, resulted in 
significant reduction in the interference rejection capability and performance of the DTV 
receiver and in the D/U ratios derived from the single interfering signal case.  For example, the 
D/U ratio for receiver 5 on the first upper adjacent channel was reduced by 4.5 dB with the 
introduction of a second interfering signal at half the power on the first lower adjacent channel.
Other combinations resulted in even larger degradations of receiver performance.  In fact, the 
performance of receiver 5 with regard to a single interfering N+6 channel or D/U ratio was 
reduced by 33 dB with the introduction of a second interferer on channel N+3.  These larger 
degradations are presumably a result of non-linear effects of the intermodulation products.   
These test results suggest that additional margins should be included in the D/U ratios to 
take into account multiple interfering signals.  The CRC results show that the worst case appears 
to be N+x and N+2x.  As a number of TV band devices will be operating on multiple channels in 
close proximity to a TV receiver, MSTV urges the Commission to conduct exhaustive testing 
and evaluation of multiple signal tests.  
E.
TV Band Devices Have The Potential To Cause Severe Out-of-Band 
Interference.
Out-of-band emissions (i.e., interference from energy generated by a device on channels 
or frequencies outside the channel being used by the television station) at the levels proposed to

ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 22 of 40 
be allowed by the FNPRM will pose a particularly serious threat to television receivers.  
Specifically, the FNPRM proposes to use the existing Part 15.209 emission limits, noting that 
these limits have been in use for years.42  It was never anticipated, however, that Part 15 limits 
would apply to devices actually operating in the TV bands, and they are ineffective at preventing 
interference in this case.
In proposing use of the current Part 15.209 limits, the FNPRM fails to recognize the 
technical reasons why these limits have not been problematic previously.  First and foremost, the 
highest out-of-band emissions generally occur closest to the operating frequency of an 
unlicensed device.  The television band is currently a “restricted band” and unlicensed devices 
are, and have been, prohibited from operating on any television channel.  Therefore, the out-of-
band emissions in the band have been far from the device’s operating frequency, and generally 
well below the Part 15.209 limits.  Secondly, until recently, most unlicensed devices operated 
with narrow bandwidths.  Consequently, the out-of-band emissions from these devices were 
generally narrowband “spikes” that presented low interference risks.   
The technical situation is quite different, however, in the context of the television band 
and the types of “low power” devices likely to be deployed.  The devices the Commission is now 
proposing to allow in the television band are wide band devices which, of course, will have wide 
out-of-band emissions.  Furthermore, because the devices will be operating within the television 
band itself, the out-of-band emissions will also be much closer to the television operating 
frequency and may be operating right at the Part 15.209 levels.  These factors drastically 
diminish the effectiveness of the Part 15.209 limits.    
42 See First R&O and FNPRM at ¶ 60.

ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186 
Page 23 of 40 
Concerns with the application of Part 15.209 limits to the television band are not only 
theoretical; CRC and MSTV have conducted laboratory testing and field studies showing that 
operation of TV band devices at the FNPRM’s proposed out-of-band limits are inadequate and 
will cause significant interference.43  These tests have demonstrated that unlicensed devices, 
complying with the FCC’s proposed out-of-band emission limits, could cause interference to 
DTV sets at distances up to 78 feet and interference to analog TV sets up to 452 feet.44     
In addition to MSTV and NAB, others, including Motorola45 and IEEE 802.22, 46 have 
confirmed that desensitization interference to TV receivers by new devices is a real problem that 
needs to be addressed.  In fact, IEEE 802.22 independently studied the out-of-band emission 
problem highlighted by MSTV, and the working group tentatively determined that the FCC out-
of-band limits are insufficient to protect DTV receivers by some 33 dB.47  These studies, when 
viewed alongside the fact that the Part 15.209 limits have never been used to protect operations 
within the broadcast spectrum, support the conclusion that a far more stringent out-of-band 
emission limit is necessary in order to protect the viewing public.  
 Furthermore, these harmful out-of-band emissions will degrade use of consumer 
products such as VCRs, and, importantly, analog to-digital converter boxes.  As MSTV, NAB 
and the Consumer Electronics Association recently explained to the NTIA and Commission, 
43 These CRC laboratory tests are included in Exhibits C and D.

receivers within the protected contour”).

requirements are insufficient to protect DTV receivers by some 33 dB for 1 dB desensitization of

such converter boxes are essential to “protect the rights of all Americans to receive free, over-
the-air television service after the transition.”48  But even assuming a successful deployment of 
converter boxes, which will be aided in large part by the federal government’s $1.5 billion 
converter box program, many analog households could end up without television services due to 
out-of-band emissions from TV band devices.  To protect such viewers, the Commission must 
determine new, stricter out-of-band emission limits before allowing any TV band device to 
operate in the broadcast spectrum.  MSTV and NAB urge the Commission to specify the out-of-
band emission limits for these TV band devices in terms of a specific transmitter mask, rather 
than solely relying on new lower 15.209 limits.  The new mask should take into account the 
testing, analysis and findings of MSTV, CRC and IEEE 802.22. 
F.
TV Band Devices Should Be Extensively Tested Prior to Developing Rules and 
Measurement Procedures for Operation in the TV Bands. 
MSTV and NAB support the Commission’s intent to conduct extensive testing as part of 
the process to develop technical rules and compliance measurement procedures for TV band 
devices.49  Both testing to develop appropriate standards and compliance measurement 
procedures to ensure that devices comply with those standards are critical components of this 
rule making to ensure that TV band devices do not cause interference to TV viewers and other 
licensed operations.  Accordingly, MSTV and NAB urge the Commission to publish and seek 
public comment on its testing program and the measurement procedures for these TV band 
devices.

If sensing is permitted and employed in a TV band device, MSTV and NAB agree with 
the Commission that all three signal types, an ATSC DTV signal, an NTSC signal and a 200 kHz 
FM signal, should be used to test the sensing capability of a TV band device.  However, MSTV 
and NAB do not agree with the Commission’s suggested procedure of merely adjusting the 
“peak levels” of these signals to the sensing detection threshold.  Adjusting the “peak levels” to 
the threshold value is an inadequate test procedure to evaluate “real world” over-the-air TV 
signals, that can be  subject to severe multipath and other propagation effects.  The ATSC A/74 
DTV Receiver recommended practices require DTV receivers to be tested using 50 field 
ensembles or “real world” signal captures that take into account actual multipath and propagation 
effects.50  These 50 captures, or at a minimum some significant subset of these captures, should 
be used to test the TV band device just as they are used by electronic circuit designers to test the 
performance of DTV receivers. That is, the TV band device should be tested with each of these 
captures and the signal level of each capture should be adjusted such that the “peak level” as 
measured over 6 MHz is raised to the threshold level where the TV band device should cease 
operating on the channel.  This will ensure that the “sensing” technique actually works with real 
world TV signals, and narrowband detection techniques, such as pilot detection, do not 
inadvertently let the unlicensed device operate in situations where the pilot carrier is faded but 
the energy across the entire DTV signal is above the threshold and the signal would provide a 
usable DTV signal level within the interference range of the unlicensed device.  MSTV and NAB 
also do not believe that there should be any “pass/fail” ratio. The TV band device should operate 
correctly with all ensembles and cease operation when the ensemble is at the specified threshold.  
50 See ATSC Recommended Practice: Receiver Performance Guidelines, Document A/74, June 
18, 2004.  These 50 ensembles are actual over-the-air signal captures recorded in the 
Washington, DC area and in New York City.

This is consistent with Part 15 requirements that unlicensed devices must not cause interference 
to licensed operations.51
IEEE 802.22 is also currently in the process of defining a uniform methodology to 
evaluate the sensing level performance of these TV band devices along the lines suggested 
above.52  MSTV and NAB support this effort and believe such an activity will help the 
Commission in its effort to develop testing methodology and compliance measurement 
procedures.  Specifically, IEEE 802.22 proposes using off-air signal captures to evaluate the 
various sensing proposals.53  The IEEE 802.22 also defines the threshold levels over a 6 MHz 
bandwidth for TV signals, and over a 200 kHz bandwidth for Part 74 devices.

IF DEVICES ARE ALLOWED TO OPERATE ON AN UNLICENSED BASIS, 
THE COMMISSION MUST OVERCOME ITS LACK OF AN EFFECTIVE 
MEANS TO ENFORCE ITS PROHIBITION ON INTERFERENCE FROM TV 
BAND DEVICES TO EXISTING LICENSED SERVICES. 
Particularly if the Commission allows TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis, 
as some parties have proposed,54 enforcement of interference protection rules will be difficult at 
best.  One of the most significant problems with an unlicensed devices regime is the fact that a 
consumer has no idea what is causing the interference.  Even if a consumer can identify that their 
interruption in television service is due to interference from an unlicensed device and report it, 
51 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.5(d).
52 Note that while IEEE 802.22 has proposed a DTV detection threshold level of -116 dBm over 
a 6 MHz bandwidth, it specifically states that sensing alone is not sufficient and requires both 
GPS and professional installation to ensure that the device is located outside the service area. 
53 IEEE 802.22 proposes that when testing the various sensing proposals, it is imperative the 
testing be conducted with the complete system not just the sensor.  The TV band device should 
include a front end and a functioning tuner to properly assess the effect of these components on 
the sensor.

Comments”).

little can be done to help that viewer.  Multiple parties have submitted comments throughout this 
proceeding addressing this concern and the difficulties the Commission will face in finding the 
interfering device and shutting it off.55  If these devices are allowed to operate on an unlicensed 
basis, access to free spectrum will mean that an untold number of devices will be operating in the 
band and there will be no records as to where and when they are operating.  The problematic 
effects of an unlicensed system will be most evident in highly populated areas where there will 
be countless unlicensed devices in operation.  And even if interference is reported and linked to 
unlicensed devices, the Commission will lack the means, and potentially the authority, to find 
and shut down the interfering devices.   
A.
In An Unlicensed Regime, Consumers Will Be Unable To Resolve Problems 
With Interference.
If the Commission authorizes TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis within 
the broadcast spectrum, consumers will experience harmful interference and will be ill equipped 
to both identify such interference and eradicate its effects.  While in theory a consumer could 
eliminate this problem by turning off the unlicensed device, the Commission should not presume 
that viewers will understand the connection between unlicensed TV band devices and the 
problems with their television set(s).  Consumers will not know they are causing interference to 
their neighbors.  These devices will be on throughout the day and consequently, there will be few 
55 See Comments of the Society of Broadcast Engineers, ET Docket No. 04-186 (filed Nov. 30, 
2004) at 7 (“the difficulty of finding an offending high power Part 15 device, to say nothing of 
persuading the operator of that device to shut it down”); Comments of the National Cable & 
Telecommunications Association, ET Docket No. 04-186 (filed Nov. 30, 2004) at 3 (“the 
presence of hundreds or thousands of the devices could create an electromagnetic cloud making 
it nearly impossible to identify a single source of interference in the presence of many such 
sources”); Comments of Qualcomm, Inc., ET Docket No. 04-186 (filed Nov. 30, 2004) at 12 (it 
could be “impossible” to “pinpoint and cure harmful interference” from unlicensed devices).

opportunities for affected consumers to discover the relationship between the unlicensed device 
and lack of television service.
Furthermore, the initial NPRM mistakenly assumes that television sets within 10 meters 
of a TV band device will be under the control of the same user, 56 and therefore infers that 
interference concerns would be less severe.  However, both the underlying premise and the 
resulting conclusion are in fact false.  As noted above, interference will occur well beyond 10 
meters.  Also, mere control over both devices does not guarantee that a user will be able to 
identify and fix the interference.  In addition, in crowded areas, such as hotels, offices, and 
apartment buildings, a television set may often be within 10 meters of an interfering unlicensed 
device that is not under the control of the person whose television has inexplicably ceased 
operation.  This will make both identification and resolution of the problem even more 
improbable.  As neither the operator of the TV band device, nor the person experiencing 
interference with DTV service will be aware of the connection between the two, the likely result 
will be that consumers will return their DTV sets.  Consumers will be frustrated by the 
inexplicable blank screens and will have no way of remedying the situation.      
B.
The Commission Lacks The Means, And Potentially The Authority, To 
Resolve The Problems With Unlicensed Devices.   
While some have argued that the Commission will be able to effectively regulate these 
problems by shutting down devices or recalling all unlicensed devices found to cause 
interference, there has been little said as to how the problem could be identified and how
enforcement measures, such as a recall, could be accomplished.57  The Commission has the 
56 See Initial White Spaces NPRM at ¶ 31, note 50.
57 See NAF Comments at 34 (asserting that the Commission can make clear it will “cancel its 
certification of devices and may order recalls of devices if necessary”).

authority to stop the manufacture and sale of new devices within the United States.  The 
problem, however, is that once these devices are in the market, there is no practical way of 
identifying even which category of devices may be causing interference, let alone pinpointing a 
specific device.58
Furthermore, even if interfering TV band devices are actually identified, the Commission 
potentially lacks the authority, or at a minimum, has historically demonstrated an unwillingness, 
to recall such interfering devices.  Recently, for example, it was discovered that FM transmitters 
designed for use with XM Satellite Radio Inc. (“XM”) and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (“Sirius”) 
radios did not comply with Commission regulations.  A study conducted by NAB found that of 
the 17 devices tested, 13 exceeded the field strength ceilings for operation of unlicensed devices 
under the Commission’s Part 15 rules.59  Both XM and Sirius eventually admitted that these 
devices were noncompliant, and the Commission ordered the manufacturers to cease producing 
such devices.60
While the Commission has worked with the two companies to ensure that any new 
devices comply with the standards, a recall was never ordered. In fact, the Commission’s level 
of involvement in this issue was only possible because XM and Sirius are FCC licensees.  If TV 
band devices are allowed to operate within the broadcast spectrum on an unlicensed basis, the 
Commission will have even less oversight authority.  Given the lack of a recall order after 
58 Importantly, unlicensed spectrum use is not necessarily connected to a “service,” which makes 
interference mitigation and elimination especially difficult.  In the unlicensed world, the device 
itself is the interfering entity and there may be no service provider responsible for eliminating the 
interference being caused.

serious violations by XM and Sirius that caused widespread radio interference, it is difficult to 
believe the Commission would be in a position to order a recall of unlicensed TV band devices 
found to be causing interference.
C.
It Will Also Be Difficult For The Commission To Prevent The Sale Of Illegal 
Devices And Aftermarket Accessories.  
While the Commission’s rules require unlicensed device certification and forbid the 
modification of such devices, the Commission will have limited capacity to prevent the internet 
sale of TV band devices and accessories that do not comport with the Commission’s 
requirements.   
By way of background, Section 15.203 of the Commission’s rules require that a Part 15 
unlicensed transmitter “shall be designed to ensure that no antenna other than that furnished by 
the responsible party shall be used with the device,” and this section of the rules requires that the 
antenna must be “permanently attached” to the device or the device must use a “unique 
coupling” or connector for attaching the antenna to the device.  In addition, Section 15.204 
prohibits the use of external radio frequency amplifiers and antenna modifications.   The intent of 
these rules is to prevent a user from increasing the interference potential of an unlicensed device, 
either by attaching a higher gain antenna to the device or by using an amplifier to increase the 
device’s range.
A simple search of the internet, however, demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these rules. 
One web site (http://www.radiolabs.com) lists adapter cables for over 150 Wi-Fi devices made 
by over 35 different manufacturers that permit the connection of unapproved high gain antennas 
to these unlicensed devices.61  This site also offers amplifiers to increase range, such as a device 
that claims to increase the  power of the Apple Airport Wi-Fi system by a factor of 15 and

activate the antenna jack so theoretically a user could attach an even higher gain unapproved 
antenna.62  Another website (http://www.hyperlinktech.com) also lists Wi-Fi high gain antennas 
and amplifiers.   A third site (http://www.ccrane.com/) offers both higher gain antennas63 and 
illegal connectors.64  These are just a few of the many examples of products intended to modify 
unlicensed devices.
The Commission must take note of the realities of the offerings on the Internet and the 
ease by which consumers may modify unlicensed devices to operate outside of the parameters 
allowed in the Commission’s rules.  In an unlicensed system, despite its best intentions the
