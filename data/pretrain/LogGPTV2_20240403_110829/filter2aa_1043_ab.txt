**A. The Proposed Detection Threshold Level of -116 dBm Does Not Provide Sufficient Protection**

The proposed detection threshold level of -116 dBm is insufficient to ensure that TV band devices are far enough outside a television station’s service area to avoid causing harmful interference. 

**1. Inadequate Protection for TV Viewers**

TV viewers typically avoid locations where the signal is inadequate, such as using an indoor antenna in a basement, because the TV receiver will not function properly. However, users of TV band devices have no incentive to avoid such poor reception areas within the TV contour. In fact, the TV band device might provide more channels and capacity, leading the user to be unaware that the device is causing interference to TV reception.

**2. Technical Analysis of the Detection Threshold**

The -116 dBm detection threshold is referenced to a 0 dBi gain antenna. For this example, assume the -116 dBm detection threshold is measured over a 6 MHz TV channel. There are significant physical differences between the "receive" system used by unlicensed devices and a TV receiver. A -116 dBm signal received by a TV band device is equivalent to a -99 dBm signal received by a TV receiver, considering the difference in antenna gain and height (a 10 dB difference in antenna gain and a 7 dB difference in height).

The question then arises: can a TV signal of -99 dBm or less occur within or close to the protected TV contour? The answer is yes. In limited measurements taken in 1998 by MSTV of WETA’s coverage, three outdoor sites within the protected contour (located 36.4, 37.8, and 42.9 miles from the transmitter) had signal levels less than -99 dBm or -116 dBm referenced to a 0 dBi antenna. Therefore, a TV band device sensing at -116 dBm at these locations would fail to protect TV viewers. Additionally, many sites had signal levels only a few decibels above the -99 dBm level. Since the measurement procedure called for locating the “maximum” signal level at each location, it is highly likely that the “average” signal level at these locations would be well below the -99 dBm level. All these measurements were taken outdoors, where reception was expected to be successful. If the TV band devices were assumed to be located indoors, where the TV signal is attenuated by 10 dB, the analysis showed that 38% of the locations would still experience interference.

**3. Hidden Node Problem**

The sensing level must also be low enough to protect against the “hidden node” problem, where the TV band device is behind an obstruction, such as a building or hill, preventing it from receiving the television signal. In such cases, the channel would appear vacant to the TV band device, and it would transmit, even though it is well within the service area of a co-channel television station.

**B. The Sensing Proposals Are Flawed**

The sensing proposals erroneously assume that a predetermined detection threshold level (whether -116 dBm or otherwise) will guarantee that the unlicensed device is sufficiently outside the protected television station’s service area, thus preventing interference. As discussed, signal detection and sensing alone cannot accurately predict location. There may be locations within the service area where the signal level is below the designated sensing detection level, making the current proposed -116 dBm sensing level ineffective at preventing interference. Additional protections, as outlined in Section V, are necessary to prevent co-channel interference.

**C. Misplaced Comparison with 5 GHz Band**

The FNPRM and other commenting parties have misused the fact that spectrum sensing has been preliminarily used to prevent interference in the 5 GHz band as support for its use in the TV band. This comparison confuses the problem of transmitter detection (for which sensing is relatively effective) with the real issue of protecting television reception from interference (for which sensing is inadequate). While the FNPRM acknowledges the differences between the effectiveness of sensing in the 5 GHz band and in the broadcast spectrum, it mistakenly argues that the problem can be fixed with a more sensitive detection threshold. In reality, it is much easier to use sensing technologies to protect a 5 GHz radar receiver than consumers’ DTV reception.

**1. Differences in Receiver Locations**

In the 5 GHz band, the radar receiver to be protected is co-located with the radar transmitter, making protection straightforward. In contrast, television receivers are located throughout a television station’s service area, making it impossible to sense a signal that tells an unlicensed device how close it is to a television receiver or viewer.

**2. Signal Strength and Antenna Performance**

Unlike broadcast signals, radar signals are strong and easier to detect. The antennas for unlicensed devices at 5 GHz are small, efficient, and have uniform performance across the band. In the broadcast arena, building a small, efficient, and practical antenna to detect occupied channels with uniform performance across all television channels is extremely difficult due to the varying wavelengths. At 5 GHz, the wavelength is less than about 2.5 inches, allowing for a very effective sensing antenna in a small space. In the television spectrum, the wavelength can vary from 17 inches in the upper UHF band to 18 feet at VHF bands, necessitating a significantly larger antenna for an unlicensed device.

**3. Robustness of Radar Systems**

Radar systems are robust and can effectively deal with interference, whereas any low-power operation in the television band caused by errors in detection will result in widespread interference to viewers. Therefore, detection by TV band devices must be correct all of the time to avoid harmful interference.

**D. Operation on First Adjacent Channels Will Cause Harmful Interference**

In addition to the harms of co-channel operation, any operation of TV band devices on a television station’s first adjacent channel will cause severe and unacceptable interference to licensed television services. The following analysis demonstrates the harms of adjacent channel operations, considering three signal levels (from moderately strong to weak signal conditions) for DTV reception and assuming a free space propagation model for the interfering TV band device.

| TV Band Device Power | DTV Signal Strength | Interference to DTV Reception |
|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| 100 mW               | 41 dBu              | 780 meters                     |
|                      | 59 dBu              | 100 meters                     |
|                      | 69 dBu              | 30 meters                      |
| 400 mW               | 41 dBu              | 1.5 kilometers                 |
|                      | 59 dBu              | 200 meters                     |
|                      | 69 dBu              | 60 meters                      |

As indicated by the chart, DTV viewers, even hundreds of meters from a 100 mW TV band device operating on a first adjacent channel, will experience harmful interference. The interference concerns are even greater for the higher-powered 400 mW devices, which may cause interference to DTV services for over a kilometer. Since received signal strength varies throughout the TV station’s service area and depends on the type of antenna a viewer is using, there is no practical way to predict or avoid this type of interference. Therefore, the Commission must exclude all TV band devices from operating within the contour of a first adjacent channel.

**E. CRC TV Receiver Tests Demonstrate Interference**

To assist the Commission’s effort in testing television receivers, MSTV funded laboratory testing by CRC of five VSB receivers to determine and quantify their interference performance. The study included a current DTV model and other recent models. The results indicate that interference performance can vary substantially across different DTV receivers and for different interference mechanisms. No single DTV receiver provided the best or worst performance across all tests and measurements.

**1. Interference Performance Variability**

For example, receiver #5 (as described in Exhibit B) performed well in the weak signal single interferer case but poorly in the higher signal single interferer cases and average in the multiple interfering signals case. This suggests that in developing appropriate D/U protection ratios, the Commission should consider selecting values met by all measured TV receivers to protect all TV viewers. Using median values lacks technical justification and would protect less than half of the measured TV receivers.

**2. Interference on First Adjacent Channels**

Based on the CRC measurements, the lowest D/U ratios or greatest protection of DTV receivers is required on the first adjacent channels. For some receivers, the upper adjacent is the most critical, while for others, the lower adjacent is most important. CRC calculated the radius of interference for each receiver, assuming the interfering device is operating at 100 mW with a 6 dBi transmitting antenna gain. All adjacent channel interference distances were substantially greater than 10 meters. In some cases, where the desired signal was only 7 dB above the value at the edge of the contour, the interference distances for the five DTV receivers varied from 60.9 meters to 229 meters. The presence of a second interfering signal further lowered the required protection levels by up to 4.5 dB, increasing these distances.

**3. Interference on Second and Third Adjacent Channels**

The CRC measurement results suggest that operation of TV band devices on second and third adjacent channels could also be problematic. Single interfering signal tests show that TV device operation on second and third adjacent channels would cause interference at distances well beyond 10 meters. For example, a TV band device operating at 400 mW would cause interference to receiver 5 at a distance of 43.5 meters on the lower second adjacent channel and 17.7 meters on the lower third adjacent channel.

**4. Multiple Interfering Signals**

The CRC tests also considered the effects on TV receivers when two interfering signals occurred on different channels. The introduction of a second interfering signal, even at half the power (-3 dB) of the first, resulted in significant reduction in the interference rejection capability and performance of the DTV receiver and in the D/U ratios derived from the single interfering signal case. For example, the D/U ratio for receiver 5 on the first upper adjacent channel was reduced by 4.5 dB with the introduction of a second interfering signal at half the power on the first lower adjacent channel. These test results suggest that additional margins should be included in the D/U ratios to account for multiple interfering signals.

**F. Out-of-Band Emissions Pose a Severe Threat**

Out-of-band emissions at the levels proposed by the FNPRM will pose a particularly serious threat to television receivers. The FNPRM proposes to use the existing Part 15.209 emission limits, noting that these limits have been in use for years. However, it was never anticipated that Part 15 limits would apply to devices actually operating in the TV bands, and they are ineffective at preventing interference in this case.

**1. Technical Reasons for Ineffectiveness**

First, the highest out-of-band emissions generally occur closest to the operating frequency of an unlicensed device. The television band is currently a “restricted band,” and unlicensed devices are prohibited from operating on any television channel. Therefore, the out-of-band emissions in the band have been far from the device’s operating frequency and generally well below the Part 15.209 limits. Secondly, until recently, most unlicensed devices operated with narrow bandwidths, resulting in out-of-band emissions that were generally narrowband “spikes” presenting low interference risks.

**2. New Technical Challenges**

The technical situation is different in the context of the television band and the types of “low power” devices likely to be deployed. These devices will have wide out-of-band emissions, and because they will be operating within the television band itself, the out-of-band emissions will be much closer to the television operating frequency and may be operating right at the Part 15.209 levels. These factors drastically diminish the effectiveness of the Part 15.209 limits.

**3. Testing and Field Studies**

CRC and MSTV have conducted laboratory testing and field studies showing that operation of TV band devices at the FNPRM’s proposed out-of-band limits is inadequate and will cause significant interference. These tests have demonstrated that unlicensed devices, complying with the FCC’s proposed out-of-band emission limits, could cause interference to DTV sets at distances up to 78 feet and to analog TV sets up to 452 feet.

**4. Recommendations**

Others, including Motorola and IEEE 802.22, have confirmed that desensitization interference to TV receivers by new devices is a real problem. IEEE 802.22 independently studied the out-of-band emission problem highlighted by MSTV and tentatively determined that the FCC out-of-band limits are insufficient to protect DTV receivers by some 33 dB. These studies, along with the fact that the Part 15.209 limits have never been used to protect operations within the broadcast spectrum, support the conclusion that a far more stringent out-of-band emission limit is necessary to protect the viewing public.

**G. Extensive Testing Prior to Rule Development**

MSTV and NAB support the Commission’s intent to conduct extensive testing as part of the process to develop technical rules and compliance measurement procedures for TV band devices. Both testing to develop appropriate standards and compliance measurement procedures to ensure that devices comply with those standards are critical components of this rulemaking to ensure that TV band devices do not cause interference to TV viewers and other licensed operations. Accordingly, MSTV and NAB urge the Commission to publish and seek public comment on its testing program and the measurement procedures for these TV band devices.

If sensing is permitted and employed in a TV band device, MSTV and NAB agree with the Commission that all three signal types—an ATSC DTV signal, an NTSC signal, and a 200 kHz FM signal—should be used to test the sensing capability of a TV band device. However, MSTV and NAB do not agree with the Commission’s suggested procedure of merely adjusting the “peak levels” of these signals to the sensing detection threshold. Adjusting the “peak levels” to the threshold value is an inadequate test procedure to evaluate “real world” over-the-air TV signals, which can be subject to severe multipath and other propagation effects. The ATSC A/74 DTV Receiver recommended practices require DTV receivers to be tested using 50 field ensembles or “real world” signal captures that take into account actual multipath and propagation effects. These 50 captures, or at a minimum, a significant subset of these captures, should be used to test the TV band device. The signal level of each capture should be adjusted such that the “peak level” as measured over 6 MHz is raised to the threshold level where the TV band device should cease operating on the channel. This will ensure that the “sensing” technique actually works with real-world TV signals and that narrowband detection techniques, such as pilot detection, do not inadvertently let the unlicensed device operate in situations where the pilot carrier is faded but the energy across the entire DTV signal is above the threshold and the signal would provide a usable DTV signal level within the interference range of the unlicensed device. MSTV and NAB also do not believe that there should be any “pass/fail” ratio. The TV band device should operate correctly with all ensembles and cease operation when the ensemble is at the specified threshold.

**H. Enforcement Challenges in an Unlicensed Regime**

Particularly if the Commission allows TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis, enforcement of interference protection rules will be difficult. One of the most significant problems with an unlicensed device regime is that a consumer has no idea what is causing the interference. Even if a consumer can identify that their interruption in television service is due to interference from an unlicensed device and report it, little can be done to help that viewer. Multiple parties have submitted comments throughout this proceeding addressing this concern and the difficulties the Commission will face in finding the interfering device and shutting it off. If these devices are allowed to operate on an unlicensed basis, access to free spectrum will mean that an untold number of devices will be operating in the band, and there will be no records as to where and when they are operating. The problematic effects of an unlicensed system will be most evident in highly populated areas where there will be countless unlicensed devices in operation. Even if interference is reported and linked to unlicensed devices, the Commission will lack the means, and potentially the authority, to find and shut down the interfering devices.

**1. Consumers Unable to Resolve Interference**

If the Commission authorizes TV band devices to operate on an unlicensed basis within the broadcast spectrum, consumers will experience harmful interference and will be ill-equipped to both identify such interference and eradicate its effects. While in theory, a consumer could eliminate this problem by turning off the unlicensed device, the Commission should not presume that viewers will understand the connection between unlicensed TV band devices and the problems with their television set(s). Consumers will not know they are causing interference to their neighbors. These devices will be on throughout the day, and consequently, there will be few opportunities for affected consumers to discover the relationship between the unlicensed device and the lack of television service.

**2. Commission Lacks Means to Resolve Problems**

While some have argued that the Commission will be able to effectively regulate these problems by shutting down devices or recalling all unlicensed devices found to cause interference, there has been little said as to how the problem could be identified and how enforcement measures, such as a recall, could be accomplished. The Commission has the authority to stop the manufacture and sale of new devices within the United States. The problem, however, is that once these devices are in the market, there is no practical way of identifying even which category of devices may be causing interference, let alone pinpointing a specific device.

Furthermore, even if interfering TV band devices are identified, the Commission potentially lacks the authority, or at a minimum, has historically demonstrated an unwillingness, to recall such interfering devices. Recently, it was discovered that FM transmitters designed for use with XM Satellite Radio Inc. (“XM”) and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. (“Sirius”) radios did not comply with Commission regulations. A study conducted by NAB found that of the 17 devices tested, 13 exceeded the field strength ceilings for operation of unlicensed devices under the Commission’s Part 15 rules. Both XM and Sirius eventually admitted that these devices were noncompliant, and the Commission ordered the manufacturers to cease producing such devices. While the Commission has worked with the two companies to ensure that any new devices comply with the standards, a recall was never ordered. In fact, the Commission’s level of involvement in this issue was only possible because XM and Sirius are FCC licensees. If TV band devices are allowed to operate within the broadcast spectrum on an unlicensed basis, the Commission will have even less oversight authority. Given the lack of a recall order after serious violations by XM and Sirius that caused widespread radio interference, it is difficult to believe the Commission would be in a position to order a recall of unlicensed TV band devices found to be causing interference.

**3. Internet Sale of Illegal Devices and Accessories**

While the Commission’s rules require unlicensed device certification and forbid the modification of such devices, the Commission will have limited capacity to prevent the internet sale of TV band devices and accessories that do not comport with the Commission’s requirements. Section 15.203 of the Commission’s rules require that a Part 15 unlicensed transmitter “shall be designed to ensure that no antenna other than that furnished by the responsible party shall be used with the device,” and this section of the rules requires that the antenna must be “permanently attached” to the device or the device must use a “unique coupling” or connector for attaching the antenna to the device. In addition, Section 15.204 prohibits the use of external radio frequency amplifiers and antenna modifications. The intent of these rules is to prevent a user from increasing the interference potential of an unlicensed device, either by attaching a higher gain antenna to the device or by using an amplifier to increase the device’s range.

A simple search of the internet, however, demonstrates the ineffectiveness of these rules. Websites like radiolabs.com list adapter cables for over 150 Wi-Fi devices made by over 35 different manufacturers that permit the connection of unapproved high-gain antennas to these unlicensed devices. Another website, hyperlinktech.com, also lists Wi-Fi high-gain antennas and amplifiers. A third site, ccrane.com, offers both higher gain antennas and illegal connectors. These are just a few of the many examples of products intended to modify unlicensed devices.

The Commission must take note of the realities of the offerings on the Internet and the ease by which consumers may modify unlicensed devices to operate outside of the parameters allowed in the Commission’s rules. In an unlicensed system, despite its best intentions, the Commission will struggle to enforce its regulations and protect the viewing public from harmful interference.
