note that MTA-STS is an alternative to DANE to authenticate
destination email servers. As they cannot check the integrity
and authenticity of the MTA-STS records, however, they are
vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks [53], which can
manipulate or drop MTA-STS lookups or redirect them to a
wrong destination mail server. Among the 26 email service
providers whose DNS resolvers enable the DO bit, only seven
email service providers fetch DNSKEYs and DS records. It is a
serious issue that the 19 email service providers do not fetch
DNSKEYs and DS records even if the DO bit is set. Thus, 23
(i.e., 4 + 19) email service providers are still susceptible to
DNS poisoning attacks. This result is in line with the recent
study [22], which showed that 82% of the DNS resolvers
managed by local ISPs actually do not perform DNSSEC
validation. Even more alarmingly, of the seven email service
providers that do fetch DNSKEYs and DS records, we ﬁnd that
three email providers (mynet.com, sapo.pt, and sina.com)
explicitly disable DNSSEC validation by setting the CD bit.
Thus, their resolvers incur the communications overhead
for DNSSEC responses including DNSKEYs and DS records,
whose sizes are much larger (by a factor of 6× ∼ 12×)
than those of DNS (i.e., non-DNSSEC) responses [81], but
do not bother to validate the results. Finally, we observe
12All other settings such as DNSSEC and STARTTLS are correct.
