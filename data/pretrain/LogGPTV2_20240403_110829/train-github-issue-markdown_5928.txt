This was reported in #16699 but while the error is fixed on the canary when
using `std/http/server.ts` it remains when using `Deno.serve`. Therefore, I am
making this issue to separate concerns.
Repro:
    await Deno.serve(() => new Response("Hello World!"));
    deno run --allow-net --unstable --watch server.ts
After making file changes to `server.ts` and saving it shows:
    Watcher File change detected! Restarting!
    error: Uncaught AddrInUse: Address already in use (os error 98)
    Watcher Process finished. Restarting on file change...
