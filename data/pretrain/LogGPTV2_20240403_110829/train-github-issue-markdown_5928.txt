### Issue Description

This issue was initially reported in #16699. While the error has been resolved in the canary build for `std/http/server.ts`, it persists when using `Deno.serve`. To address this, I am creating a separate issue to focus on the specific problem with `Deno.serve`.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Run the following code in a file named `server.ts`:
    ```typescript
    await Deno.serve(() => new Response("Hello World!"));
    ```

2. Execute the server with the following command:
    ```sh
    deno run --allow-net --unstable --watch server.ts
    ```

3. Make and save changes to `server.ts`.

### Observed Behavior

After making and saving changes to `server.ts`, the following output is displayed:

```
Watcher File change detected! Restarting!
error: Uncaught AddrInUse: Address already in use (os error 98)
Watcher Process finished. Restarting on file change...
```

### Expected Behavior

The server should restart without encountering the `AddrInUse` error, and the process should continue to watch for file changes and restart as needed.
