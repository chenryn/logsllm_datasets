## Abstract
The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) binds IP address blocks to the public keys of their owners, enabling routers to perform Route Origin Validation (ROV) and prevent attacks such as IP prefix hijacking. Despite significant efforts, RPKI deployment remains slow, leaving the Internet largely insecure. This paper addresses fundamental questions about RPKI's current deployment and security: the adoption status of RPKI and ROV, the implications of partial adoption for global security, the root causes of slow adoption, and strategies to accelerate deployment. Our study combines empirical analyses, a survey of over 100 network practitioners, and extensive simulations. Key findings include low ROV enforcement at the core of the Internet, the critical vulnerability that about one-third of RPKI authorizations do not protect against hijacking, and recommendations for addressing these challenges.

## 1. Introduction
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes traffic between the tens of thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that make up the Internet. ASes range from large ISPs and content providers to small businesses and universities. BGP is vulnerable to devastating attacks and configuration errors, making it a target for nation-states and corporations to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and disconnect ASes from the Internet. A common attack vector is IP prefix hijacking, where an AS advertises an IP prefix not belonging to it. These attacks are effective and easy to launch, often masked as benign configuration errors [53]. High-profile incidents resulting from prefix hijacks frequently make the news [1], [8], [51], [52], while many others go undetected [55].

The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [38] is a hierarchical certification system that stores Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), signed records binding an IP address block to the AS allowed to advertise it in BGP. ROAs enable BGP routers to perform Route-Origin Validation (ROV) [9], [45], identifying and discarding invalid route advertisements from unauthorized ASes, thus protecting against IP prefix hijacking. RPKI is the leading and only standardized solution to prefix hijacking and is a prerequisite for other routing security mechanisms such as BGPsec [42] and proposals for defending against BGP path-manipulation attacks [15], [16], [58].

Despite RPKI's crucial role in securing the Internet routing system, its deployment remains frustratingly low [47], leaving the Internet exposed to dangerous traffic hijacking attacks. This paper embarks on a systematic study of RPKI's deployment and security, addressing the following questions: What is the adoption status of RPKI and ROV? What are the implications for security of partial adoption? What are the root causes of slow adoption? How can deployment be accelerated?

### 1.1 Main Contributions
- **Deployment Status:** We present the first quantitative study of ROV adoption, revealing disappointingly low enforcement at the core of the Internet.
- **Security Evaluation:** We show that significant security benefits cannot be attained without near-universal ROV adoption by large ISPs. Additionally, we expose a critical security vulnerability: about one-third of RPKI authorizations do not protect against hijacking.
- **Obstacles to Adoption:** We examine potential reasons for the slow adoption of RPKI and ROV, including human error in issuing RPKI certificates and inter-organization dependencies, and provide recommendations to address these challenges.
- **Recommendations:** We propose several concrete measures to drive RPKI adoption forward, including eliminating obstacles via modest changes to RPKI, targeting the core of the Internet, and improving RPKI's reliability and integrity.

## 2. Background: RPKI, RCS, ROAs, and ROV
RPKI maps IP address blocks to organizations that "own" them, laying the foundation for combating IP prefix hijacking and further protection from attacks on inter-domain routing via BGPsec and alternative proposals for defending against BGP path-manipulation attacks [15], [16], [42], [58]. 

### 2.1 Certifying Ownership
RPKI assigns an IP prefix to a public key via a Resource Certificate (RC), issued by the authoritative entity for that IP prefix. The owner of the corresponding private key can then issue a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) specifying the AS numbers of ASes authorized to advertise the IP prefix in BGP. Below, we elaborate on the specifics involved in issuing RCs and ROAs.
