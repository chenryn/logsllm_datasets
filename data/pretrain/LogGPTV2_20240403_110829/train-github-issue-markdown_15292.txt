We have some mapping options that sound interesting but are actually almost
useless or dangerous. I propose to remove them:
### `_type: { index: no }`
Not indexing the `_type` sounds appealing since documentation mentions
everything will keep on working, so that should just save space. Except that
elasticsearch will internally run a prefix query on the `_uid` field instead,
which is going to be super slow. I think we should remove this option.
### `_type: { store: yes }` and `_id: { store: yes }`
Storing the type and _id is useless since we already enforce the _uid to be
stored, and the _uid contains these informations.
### `_id: { index: not_analyzed }`
The `_id` field is the same for all documents so we should not need to index,
store or doc-value it. (Can be done now thanks to #6073 and #7965)
In general I'm wondering if we shouldn't go further and completely lock down
how data is indexed/stored/docvalued for meta fields. There would just remain
high-level configuration options such as `enabled` on the `_timestamp` mapper
or `type` on `_parent`.
