Reproduction steps:
  1. `flutter create test`
  2. replace the `lib/main.dart` with:
    import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
    void main() => runApp(new MyApp());
    class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return const Placeholderrr(); // Typo is intentional!
      }
    }
  3. compile it once with `flutter build apk --debug` and see an error message.
  4. compile it again with the same command, and see it succeed (as below)
This will really help with fixing syntax errors while coding! We just have to
compile twice! 👍
