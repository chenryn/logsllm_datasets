If you hover over an `` with a tooltip within a `.btn-group` the tooltip
will inserted between the `` and its descendants. Because this css rule
    .btn-group > .btn + .btn {
      margin-left: -1px;
    }
doesn't apply any longer to the following `` you'll see an additional grey
border.
It's kinda hard to explain, so just go there and watch for the second button
when hovering it:
