### Assumptions
Adtributor is only applicable to RAPMD datasets where the Root Anomaly Patterns (RAPs) are one-dimensional, and its Recall at k (RC@k) can reach approximately 33%.

### F. Efficiency Comparison
As illustrated in Figure 9(a), Adtributor's efficiency is the highest among all methods for groups (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3) on the Squeeze-B0 dataset, with a running time of around \(10^{-2}\) seconds. However, its effectiveness for groups (1, 2) and (1, 3) is notably low. In contrast, the proposed RAPMiner achieves near-optimal efficiency while ensuring high effectiveness for groups (1, 1), (1, 2), and (1, 3), with a running time of \(10^{-1}\) seconds. Additionally, RAPMiner maintains optimal effectiveness and efficiency for groups (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), with running times ranging from \(10^{-1}\) to \(10^0\) seconds. Squeeze demonstrates the best efficiency for groups (3, 1), (3, 2), and (3, 3). Among these algorithms, iDice exhibits the worst efficiency, taking more than 40 seconds on average to complete anomaly localization.

It is important to note that RAPMiner's efficiency is not influenced by the total number of attributes but rather by the number of attributes within the RAPs. Redundant attributes can be removed using Algorithm 1, and the time consumption increases with the depth of the top-down Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Figure 9(b) illustrates that RAPMiner does not achieve the best efficiency on the RAPMD dataset. This is because the RAPMD dataset simulates real-world scenarios with many three-dimensional RAPs. RAPMiner's efficiency in searching high-dimensional RAPs, such as three-dimensional ones, is inferior to its performance on one-dimensional or two-dimensional RAPs. Consequently, its efficiency on RAPMD is slightly lower than that of Squeeze and FP-growth. Despite this, the efficiency remains within an acceptable range, indicating a trade-off between time and effectiveness.

### G. Parameter Sensitivity
We evaluated the sensitivity of the threshold \(t_{CP}\) used in Classification Power (CP)-based redundant attribute deletion and the confidence threshold \(t_{conf}\) employed in Anomaly Confidence (AC)-guided layer-by-layer top-down search.

First, we set different values for \(t_{CP}\) to assess its sensitivity. Since classification power measures the ability to reduce entropy in the dataset, our goal is to remove attributes with low entropy reduction, i.e., redundant or irrelevant attributes. Therefore, \(t_{CP}\) should not be too high. Typically, it is set below 0.1 (10%). As shown in Figure 10(a), increasing \(t_{CP}\) slightly decreases RC@3, indicating that RAPMiner's performance is not highly sensitive to \(t_{CP}\).

Additionally, we evaluated the sensitivity of \(t_{conf}\) by setting different values. Higher anomaly confidence suggests a higher likelihood of an attribute combination being anomalous, so \(t_{conf}\) should not be too low. We selected several values greater than 0.5 (50%) to illustrate this. As depicted in Figure 10(b), increasing \(t_{conf}\) slightly increases RC@3, demonstrating that RAPMiner's performance is relatively stable with respect to \(t_{conf}\).

The parameter sensitivity analysis shows that there is a wide range of suitable values for \(t_{CP}\) and \(t_{conf}\).

### H. Efficiency Improvement through Redundant Attribute Deletion
To demonstrate the efficiency improvement of the proposed CP-based redundant attribute deletion, we conducted two experiments on the RAPMD dataset: one with redundant attribute deletion and one without. Table VI shows that redundant attribute deletion improves RAPMiner's average efficiency by 42.07%, with only a 4.87% decrease in effectiveness. These results validate the utility of the proposed CP-based redundant attribute deletion.

### VI. Related Work
Research on anomaly localization primarily includes root cause mining based on multi-dimensional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and root cause inference based on dependency graphs.

#### Root Cause Mining Based on Multi-dimensional KPIs
Many studies have focused on root cause mining using multi-dimensional KPIs. For example, Adtributor [13] targets anomaly localization in advertising systems, assuming that root anomaly patterns are one-dimensional. It uses metrics like explanation power, succinctness, and surprise to identify root causes. iDice [14] performs root cause mining in multi-dimensional attribute combinations, pruning non-anomalous combinations using the "Impact" metric. HotSpot [21] and Squeeze [22] also conduct root cause mining in multi-dimensional attribute combinations, but they make specific assumptions about the distribution of anomalies. Association rule mining, such as Apriori and FP-growth, is another approach, though its performance can be sensitive to hyperparameters.

While these methods perform well in specific scenarios, they are less effective in real-world Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) due to their restrictive assumptions. RAPMiner, in contrast, is more practical and efficient without such strict assumptions.

#### Root Cause Inference Based on Dependency Graphs
This line of research focuses on constructing dependency graphs between system modules and inferring root causes based on these graphs. Relevant studies include [28]–[30], [34], and [35]. Our work can complement these approaches by identifying the exact scope of failures, aiding in root cause analysis.

### VII. Conclusion
In this paper, we introduce RAPMiner, a novel method for localizing root anomaly patterns in real-world CDN scenarios. RAPMiner avoids restrictive assumptions by considering practical distribution features of anomaly patterns. It combines CP-based redundant attribute deletion with AC-guided top-down search to prune non-root cause attribute combinations and avoid non-root anomalies, effectively narrowing the search space. Extensive experiments demonstrate RAPMiner's superior effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in CDN scenarios.
