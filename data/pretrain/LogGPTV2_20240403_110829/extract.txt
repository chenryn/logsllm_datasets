### Extract and Extrac32

#### Overview
- **Extract.exe** and **Extrac32.exe** are command-line utilities used to extract files from cabinet archives or compressed sources.
- **Note**: On Windows Server 2016 and newer, as well as on Windows 10, `Extract.exe` is no longer provided or supported. It has been replaced by `Extrac32.exe`, which was originally part of Internet Explorer and is now integrated into the operating system.

#### Syntax

##### Extract.exe
```shell
extract [/y] [/a] [/d | /e] [/l dir] cabinet [filename ...]
extract [/y] source [newname]
extract [/y] /c source destination
```

##### Extrac32.exe
```shell
extrac32 [/Y] [/A] [/D | /E] [/L dir] cabinet [filename ...]
extrac32 [/Y] source [newname]
extrac32 [/Y] /C source destination
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `cabinet` | Specifies a cabinet file that contains two or more files. |
| `filename` | The name of the file to extract from the cabinet. Wildcards and multiple filenames (separated by spaces) can be used. |
| `source` | A compressed file (a cabinet with only one file). |
| `newname` | The new filename to assign to the extracted file. If not specified, the original filename is used. |
| `/A` | Processes all cabinets in a chain, starting with the first cabinet mentioned. |
| `/C` | Copies the source file to the destination (useful for copying from DMF disks). |
| `/D` | Displays the cabinet directory. Use this with `filename` to avoid extraction. |
| `/E` | Extracts files (use instead of `.` to extract all files). |
| `/L dir` | Specifies the location to place the extracted files (default is the current directory). |
| `/Y` | Suppresses the prompt before overwriting an existing file. |

#### Notes on Extrac32.exe
- `Extrac32.exe` can be used from the command line but does not display any output on the console.
- To view the help information, you can redirect the output through the `more` command:
  ```shell
  extrac32.exe /? | more
  ```
