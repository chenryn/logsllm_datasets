issuance properties necessary to implement practical selective
disclosure credentials. No existing scheme provides all of
efﬁciency, threshold distributed issuance, private attributes, re-
randomization, and unlinkable multi-show selective disclosure.
The lack of efﬁcient general purpose selective disclosure
credentials impacts platforms that support ‘smart contracts’,
such as Ethereum [53], Hyperledger [15] and Chainspace [1].
They all share the limitation that veriﬁable smart contracts
may only perform operations recorded on a public blockchain.
Moreover,
the security models of these systems generally
assume that integrity should hold in the presence of a threshold
number of dishonest or faulty nodes (Byzantine fault
tol-
erance); it is desirable for similar assumptions to hold for
multiple credential issuers (threshold issuance).
Issuing credentials through smart contracts would be very
desirable: a smart contract could conditionally issue user
credentials depending on the state of the blockchain, or attest

some claim about a user operating through the contract—
such as their identity, attributes, or even the balance of their
wallet. This is not possible, as current selective credential
schemes would either entrust a single party as an issuer, or
would not provide appropriate efﬁciency, re-randomization,
blind issuance and selective disclosure capabilities (as in the
case of threshold signatures [3]). For example, the Hyperledger
system supports CL credentials [16] through a trusted third
party issuer, illustrating their usefulness, but also their fragility
against the issuer becoming malicious. Garman et al. [26]
present a decentralized anonymous credentials system inte-
grated into distributed ledgers; they provide the ability to issue
publicly veriﬁable claims without central issuers, but do not
