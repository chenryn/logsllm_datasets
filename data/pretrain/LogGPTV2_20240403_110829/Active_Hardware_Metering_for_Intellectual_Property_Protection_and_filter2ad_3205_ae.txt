ity is detected. For example, a designer can add an extra
part to the circuit that detects say, the brute force attack
where too many invalid inputs are being entered. As an-
other example, the strange activity patterns of the chip
may be detected from a network. Upon detecting such a
situation, a built-in disabling function would be invoked
that transitions the IC into a non-functional state. If this
state is a black hole, the IC cannot be used.
Generally speaking, combinations of the two em-
ployed security mechanisms, variability-based unique-
ness of each IC, and structural manipulation of FSM
while preserving the original behavioral speciﬁcation,
provide powerful basis for creating many security and
DRM protocols. A few of the many possibilities are:
(i) use of a combination of unique functionality and
RUB for remote authentication and disablement of smart
cards; (ii) certiﬁcation that a computation was executed
on a speciﬁed IC in a distributed environment; and (iii)
creation of techniques to produce software than can only
run on a speciﬁc IC, thereby preventing software piracy.
Furthermore, the introduced method has the potential
for a broad impact on the IC industry and military use
of hardware. As an example, new royalty enforcement
systems can be enabled: design reuse has emerged as a
dominant strategy, where different IP cores are often sup-
plied by different vendors. The ﬁnal integrator pays each
IP supplier royalties that are proportional to the number
of manufactured ICs. All that is needed for royalty en-
forcement is that each supplier uses its own active meter-
ing scheme inside its IP.
9 Conclusion
We propose the ﬁrst active hardware metering scheme
that symmetrically protects the IP designer and the
foundry by providing a key-exchange mechanism.
The active metering method utilizes the unclonable
variability-based ID of each silicon circuit (RUB) to
uniquely lock the IC at the fabrication house. The FSM
of the design is enhanced to include many added states,
designed such that the RUB-based state is one of the ran-
dom states with a very high probability. The state addi-
tion was done in such a way that it would not affect the
functionality of the original design. The key to the locked
IC can only be provided by the designer who knows the
state transition graph of the design. We have illustrated
the addition of black hole states to the BFSM which can
be utilized for remote control and disabling of the ICs.
Black hole states are also useful in making the protec-
tion scheme highly resilient against the brute force at-
tacks. We presented a low overhead implementation for
the hardware metering scheme, identiﬁed a comprehen-

that make the scheme much more resilient against the at-

ing method on standard benchmark circuits illustrate the
low overhead and the applicability of the approach on
industrial-size designs and its resiliency against different
attacks.
