### Security Mechanisms and Applications

To enhance security, designers can add an extra part to the circuit that detects brute force attacks, where too many invalid inputs are being entered. For example, if a brute force attack is detected, a built-in disabling function can transition the IC into a non-functional state, such as a black hole state, rendering the IC unusable.

Combining the two employed security mechanisms—variability-based uniqueness of each IC and structural manipulation of FSM while preserving the original behavioral specification—provides a powerful basis for creating various security and DRM protocols. Some potential applications include:

1. **Remote Authentication and Disablement**: Use unique functionality and RUB for remote authentication and disablement of smart cards.
2. **Certification in Distributed Environments**: Certify that a computation was executed on a specified IC in a distributed environment.
3. **Software Piracy Prevention**: Create techniques to produce software that can only run on a specific IC, thereby preventing software piracy.

Furthermore, this method has the potential for a broad impact on the IC industry and military use of hardware. For instance, new royalty enforcement systems can be enabled. Design reuse has emerged as a dominant strategy, where different IP cores are often supplied by different vendors. The final integrator pays each IP supplier royalties proportional to the number of manufactured ICs. Royalty enforcement requires each supplier to use its own active metering scheme inside its IP.

### Conclusion

We propose the first active hardware metering scheme that symmetrically protects both the IP designer and the foundry by providing a key-exchange mechanism. This method utilizes the unclonable variability-based ID of each silicon circuit (RUB) to uniquely lock the IC at the fabrication house. The FSM of the design is enhanced to include many added states, designed such that the RUB-based state is one of the random states with a very high probability. The state addition does not affect the functionality of the original design. The key to the locked IC can only be provided by the designer who knows the state transition graph of the design. We have illustrated the addition of black hole states to the BFSM, which can be utilized for remote control and disabling of the ICs. Black hole states also make the protection scheme highly resilient against brute force attacks. We presented a low overhead implementation for the hardware metering scheme, identified a comprehensive set of possible attacks, and provided mechanisms to enhance resilience against these attacks. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmark circuits demonstrate the low overhead and applicability of the approach on industrial-size designs and its resiliency against different attacks.
