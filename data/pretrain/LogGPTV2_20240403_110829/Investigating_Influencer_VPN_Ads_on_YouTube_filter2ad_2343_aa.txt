Abstract—One widespread, but frequently overlooked, source
of security information is inﬂuencer marketing ads on YouTube
for security and privacy products such as VPNs. This paper
examines how widespread these ads are, where on YouTube they
are found, and what kind of information they convey. Starting
from a random sample of 1.4% of YouTube, we identify 243
videos containing VPN ads with a total of 63 million views.
Using qualitative analysis, we ﬁnd that these ads commonly
discuss broad security guarantees as well as speciﬁc technical
features, frequently focus on internet threats, and sometimes
emphasize accessing otherwise unavailable content. Different
VPN companies tend to advertise in different categories of
channels and emphasize different messages. We ﬁnd a number
of potentially misleading claims,
including overpromises and
exaggerations that could negatively inﬂuence viewers’ mental
models of internet safety.
Index Terms—VPNs, advertising, YouTube, security education
I. INTRODUCTION
Understanding and improving how people obtain and share
security knowledge is of paramount concern to ensuring that
users make good security decisions. As such, there has been
extensive study of security education, spanning a wide variety
of training disciplines, advice from experts and peers, and
pedagogy (e.g., [1–7]). But to our knowledge, little study has
gone into an informal yet pervasive form of security education:
advertisements on YouTube.
In particular, VPN (Vritual Private Network) companies—
a $35.4 billion industry[8]—aggressively advertise on media
such as YouTube. VPN ads are particularly noteworthy be-
cause they attempt to inform users about what a VPN is and
what services it provides, as a means of convincing users to
purchase the product. As such, these ads are—for better or
worse—communicating extensive information about privacy,
security, and threats on the internet, which may inﬂuence
people’s mental models not only of VPNs, but for internet
security more broadly. In this work, we seek to understand
how pervasive VPN ads are, what information they convey
about the threats, capabilities, and potential solutions that exist
today, and how accurate these depictions are.
We chose VPNs as the primary focus of our study for three
reasons. First, based on our own experiences, we believed
these ads to be very common (though even we were surprised
to see how widely disseminated and viewed this material
is). Second, which (if any) VPN a user chooses can have
profound impact on their security and privacy, particularly
given that many VPNs leak or inject data and lie about
their service offerings [9–11]. Third, VPNs are an useful case
study as it pertains to security education. VPNs are non-
obvious technologies, with nuanced threat models (such as
eavesdropping on shared network infrastructure) and solutions
(such as encrypted tunneling) that are foreign concepts to most
users. To motivate purchases, VPNs have sought to educate
users—this paper explores the content of this education.
Our study concerns a particular kind of YouTube ad: in-
ﬂuencer ads, in which content creators themselves deliver
promotional materials as part of their video (as opposed to
interstitial ads, which are created by the company itself and are
played before, during, or after a user-chosen video). Such ads
are prominent on YouTube, and because they are embedded
into content, they are not typically blocked by ad blockers.
To study these ads, we ﬁrst obtain metadata for a random
sample of about 86 million videos: about 1.4% of videos
available on YouTube. We then obtain detailed information,
including English subtitles when available, for the most popu-
lar of these videos: about 10 million videos that have at least
800 views each. Using subtitles and manual qualitative coding,
we identify and analyze in depth 243 videos, representing a
total of 63 million views, containing inﬂuencer VPN ads.1
We apply in-depth qualitative coding to identify the threat
models VPN ads describe. We deﬁne a novel codebook that
can capture relationships within threat models, including who
the adversary is, what they do, the asset being attacked or
defended, and what the VPN does to prevent or mitigate the
threat. We also analyze other facets of VPN ads, including
claims about who should use a VPN and when, as well as
whether or not the VPN sponsorship is properly disclosed.
Moreover, in-content ads represent a particularly interesting
point in the advertising ecosystem, in that they combine the
goals of two parties: the company that wishes to sell its goods,
and the content creator that wishes to establish and maintain
their brand identity. To understand how these two forces
interoperate in the VPN ad space, we obtain the instructions
that one major VPN company provides to content creators. We
examine how the resulting inﬂuencer ads do (not) conform to
these guidelines, and evaluate them as a potential source of
inaccurate information. We note, however, that this is only a
single example, and is thus anecdotal.
We summarize our ﬁndings as follows:
• VPN ads are incredibly widely disseminated, spanning 243
videos and 63M views from late 2016 to mid 2020 in our
dataset alone. When scaled to all of YouTube, we estimate
there are 17.1K videos totaling 4.4B views, making VPN
ads a broad-reaching form of security education.

or potentially offensive language or content. Visiting these links while signed
in may disrupt future YouTube recommendations.

• YouTubers make a wide variety of claims when promot-
ing VPNs, which include promoting VPNs as a content
consumption tool, various technical claims, and vague and
in some cases potentially misleading statements about the
capabilities of VPNs and internet threats in general.
• VPN providers exhibit wide variety in their target markets.
For instance, one industry leader, NordVPN, advertises on
videos in a variety of categories (e.g., lifestyle, tech, gaming,
politics), while VirtualShield exclusively sponsors right-
wing and/or conspiratorial videos.
• VPN providers and YouTubers also differ in the claims
and features they tend to emphasize; for instance, a large
fraction of SurfShark-sponsored videos boast media access
capabilities, while VirtualShield and TunnelBear ads do not
mention them at all. Further, VirtualShield has the highest
ratio of videos with overpromises and exaggerations.
• Collectively, our results show that viewers are receiving a
plethora of security- and privacy-related information, some
of which is incorrect, misleading, or contradictory.
• Conﬁrming prior work [12], we ﬁnd many VPN ads are not
properly disclosed in accordance with FTC guidelines [13].
We view this work as one step toward understanding how
advertising shapes (and possibly harms) security mental mod-
els, and eventually behaviors. We believe our threat-model-
relationship codebook can easily be extended and applied to
other kinds of ads. To assist in such future efforts, we make
our data publicly available.2
II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK
In this section, we describe how people use YouTube as a
knowledge source, we detail advertising methods on YouTube,
we discuss prior research on mental models of privacy- and
security-enhancing technologies (PETs), and we review other
instances of companies pushing for adoption of PETs.
A. Learning from YouTube
Research indicates users are inﬂuenced by news and educa-
tional content they watch on YouTube. Using data from a 2018
Pew Research survey, Smith et al. report that more than half of
YouTube users agreed “the site is at least somewhat important
for helping them understand things that are happening in the
world,” a 2.5x increase compared to 2013 [14]. The same study
ﬁnds that many users encounter obviously false, troubling,
and abusive or demeaning content. One study of individuals’
browsing histories suggests YouTube promotes conspiratorial
and radicalized content, pushing users toward extremes [15].
Studies using crawlers to simulate user interaction have found
similar results [16]. On the other hand, Ledwich and Zaitsev’s
analysis suggests no such promotion of radicalization [17].
Our dataset includes videos with radical and conspiratorial
news content, some of which contain VPN ads.
Recently, Kross et al. found YouTube to be the top online
resource for learning information about multiple topics, in-
cluding Online safety and Programming [18]. Similarly, other
2https://osf.io/azmx8/
researchers found that a majority of users thought YouTube
was “very important” when learning “how to do things they
haven’t done before.” [14]. Although none focus directly on
YouTube, security researchers have repeatedly found users to
use (in some cases ﬁctional) media ([19–21]) and ads ([22])
to form mental models of security and privacy.
Collectively, this research highlights YouTube’s potential
as a platform for promoting and teaching about
technical
security products (e.g., VPNs). Indeed, we ﬁnd instances
of YouTubers emphasizing learning while promoting VPNs;
for example, Ivan on Tech refers to a VPN ad as “this
