### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:** v10.1.1 (also present in v9)
  * **Operating System:** macOS 10.15.5
### Actual Behavior
Node.js timers stop working indefinitely after running Electron for a while.
This breaks all async Node.js functions like `fs.readFile`,
`fs.promises.readFile`, and `http.get`:

In case it's not clear in the screenshot, `window.setTimeout` works but the
Node.js version of `setTimeout` doesn't.
`fs.readFileSync` and synchronous functions continue to work fine:

### To Reproduce
It's hard to reproduce. This issue happens randomly but frequently enough. It
could happen after 10 seconds of launching Electron or after 1 hour.
### Additional Information
`allowRendererProcessReuse` is set to `true`. I use 3 native modules in the
renderer process: `keytar`, `node-mac-contacts` and `node-mac-permissions`.
All 3 modules are up to date.
Only refreshing (âŒ˜ R) fixes this and gets everything to work again.
