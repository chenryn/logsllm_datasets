Sample Quote
"Choosing something that was memorable but not predictable to anyone that may try to unlock my phone."
"I go for a shape I like and that is easy to remember."
"My first name starts with the letter C so I drew a big C and a little C."
"First letter of my father’s first name and my mother’s first name."
"I wanted something simple enough to remember."
"Something that felt natural to me."
"To make it as random as possible."
"I viewed the dots as a 1-9 keypad and entered memorable numbers."
"One that would be hard to replicate in the correct order but easy for me to remember."
"I chose patterns with similar motions that would be easy to remember."
"I use symmetrical patterns."
"I tried to make it not too complicated because I knew I’d have to remember it without writing it down or anything. But I
tried to make it not too simple so that it felt secure enough."
"Using one shape and mirroring it."
"Easy to do one handed."
"I wanted something that I could remember & would be easy to do with either hand."
"I just liked the pattern I chose."
"I didn’t have a strategy because I’ve never used this method and don’t intend to."
"I picked something that couldn’t easily be guessed and at the same time not to difficult to memorize."
"Thinking."
"I wanted something both memorable to me but difficult to watch."
"Tried to use something that I could remember and was quick."
"Repeat the pattern to remember it better."
"Nothing really but I stayed within a smaller area."
∗ Note that each quote can be assigned multiple codes.
I feel that the Double Pattern I created provides adequate security for
unlocking my personal device.

ACSAC 2020, December 7–11, 2020, Austin, USA
Table 10: Code Book "Would use DPatt" using 25% Sub-Sample (50 per-Treatment)
You have indicated that you (would use | would not use | are unsure if you would use) the Double Pattern you created in this survey on your personal mobile device.
Please expand on why you (would use | would not use | are unsure if you would use) the Double Pattern you created here.

"It’s easy to remember and is similar to my current single pattern but more secure."
"I liked the idea and I would like to test it for several weeks."
"I thought it added a good measure of safety that I would like."
"I think I came up with good pattern."
"It would be hard to guess but easy for me to remember."
"I already use the one half of the pattern and have for as long as I’ve had an Android."
"I think that it would be the only patterns that I could remember for sure. If I created different ones I would
definitely forget about them."
"Using Secret number code I will create the pattern.so no one can know my pattern."
"It’s easy enough to remember and I like the design."
"It seems secure and it easy to remember. It also seems like it will be fast to enter each time."
"It was easy to remember. It was easy to use."
"It is complex yet I can remember it."
"I draw flags regularly. It is also difficult for a stranger to guess."
"It seems unique and complicated enough to detour people unlike PINs."
"It’s a pattern I’m already familiar with."
"Because of your recall."
"The Z pattern has always been my pattern."
"It’s easy for me to remember. And even though it’s a simple shape it would take a few tries for someone
who saw it to get right since the same shape can be achieved in many ways."
"I would not use this one because it has been recorded on this survey."
"I used it here and would probably make it slightly more complex."
"I can think of something else easier but more secure for me to remember."
"I wouldn’t use the same pattern twice for the same reason I don’t reuse passwords; it’s unsecure."
"It was way too difficult to remember."
"It was a little too simple. I only needed to remember the pattern for the survey so I didn’t choose anything
too complex."
"I’d want something more original and personal to me."
"I would use a PIN."
"I think everyone I know would automatically guess that I would use this symbol as my password just
knowing my sense of humor."
"I have issues with memory. I wouldnt want to be stuck in an emergency."
"I would want to think about what pattern I would use for a longer time than is available during this survey."
"I would not want to use a double pattern that I had used or someone knew about. I love the idea of using a
double pattern."
"I made it easy so I could remember it. But that’s not good for security reasons."
"I think the one I created is pretty standard and generic. I would use the same idea of creating a visual
number with the pattern."
"I might choose a more complicated one."
"I would likely want to mix it up and use a different one that hasn’t been previously shown to anyone
including on the study. But also I liked the patterns I came up with."
"I would have more time to select a secure double pattern."
"I would probably try the one that I created here."
"PIN is easier to remember."
"I may make my pattern different than the one shown before. I may think of a new pattern that would make
my phone more secure and safer."
"I had some trouble remembering it exactly at times so I may do something more simple but I think I’d get it
with time."
"It felt a little too easy however easy to remember. I may want something a little more complex."
"I don’t feel like a longer line or more dots will help. Also drawing longer lines can sometimes give you
errors."
"I don’t think my pattern was difficult enough. I would want to make something harder for someone to
guess."
I might have a different first response when setting up a new double pattern so it could vary or I could use
the same thing if it pops up in my head first.
"I have my pin memorized by muscle memory so its probably easier than a double pattern."
"I would like to have more time to select a secure double pattern."
"I dont usually have a password on my phone. But considering it in the future maybe."
"It depends. I may use an even simpler pattern. I have already shared my pattern here so I may change it to
something else."
"If I had another device I would. I use one I have used for a long time right now."
"I don’t know."
