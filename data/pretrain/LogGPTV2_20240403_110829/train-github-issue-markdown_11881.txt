### Source code
    @pytest.fixture(scope="session")
    def browser_context_args(browser_context_args):
        current_test = os.environ.get("PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST").split(":")[-1].split(" ")[0]
        tc_id = current_test.split("_")[1]
        path = f"results/{tc_id}.har"
        return {
            **browser_context_args,
            "viewport": {
                "width": 1920,
                "height": 1080,
            },

        }
  * I provided the exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Steps**
  * I'm using the attached fixture within the tests
  * At the end the HAR is created with all the requests done in Browser, except the `OPTIONS` method requests
  * I also tried creating the HAR file 'manually' by using `page.on("requestfinished")` but it looks like `OPTIONS` requests are not intercepted ðŸ¤”
Is there some extra configuration I'm missing to 'force' the `OPTIONS` request
to be present?
**Expected**
`OPTIONS` requests to be present
**Actual**
`OPTIONS` requests are missing
