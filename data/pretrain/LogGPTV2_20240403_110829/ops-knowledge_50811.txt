User: I want to collect data and parse it eventually from an open window in linux.
An example- Suppose a terminal window is open. I need to retrieve all the data that appears on that window. After retrieval, I would parse it to get specific commands entered.
So is it possible to do that? If so, how? I would prefer to use python to code this entire thing.
I am making a guess that first I would have to get some sort of ID for the open window and then use some kind of library to get the content from the window whose ID I have got. 
Please help. I am quite a newbie.
Assistant: I think the correct answer may be "with some difficulty". Essentially, the contents of a window is a bitmap. This bitmap is drawn on by a whole slew of primitives (including "display this octet-string, using that encoding and a specific font"), but the window contents is still "just pixels".
Getting the "just pixels" is pretty straight-forward, as these things go. You open a session to the X server and say "given me the contents of window W" and it hands it over.
Doing something useful with it is, unfortunately, a completely different matter, as you'd potentially have to (essentially) OCR the bitmap for what you want.
If you decide to take that route, have a look at the source of xwd, as that does, essentially, that.
