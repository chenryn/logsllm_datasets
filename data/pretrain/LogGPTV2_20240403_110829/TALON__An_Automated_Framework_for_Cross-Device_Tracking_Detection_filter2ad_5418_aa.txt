Abstract
Although digital advertising fuels much of today’s free Web,
it typically does so at the cost of online users’ privacy, due to
the continuous tracking and leakage of users’ personal data.
In search for new ways to optimize the effectiveness of ads,
advertisers have introduced new advanced paradigms such
as cross-device tracking (CDT), to monitor users’ browsing
on multiple devices and screens, and deliver (re)targeted ads
in the most appropriate screen. Unfortunately, this practice
leads to greater privacy concerns for the end-user.
Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we propose a novel
methodology for detecting CDT and measuring the factors
affecting its performance, in a repeatable and systematic
way. This new methodology is based on emulating realistic
browsing activity of end-users, from different devices, and
thus triggering and detecting cross-device targeted ads. We
design and build Talon1, a CDT measurement framework
that implements our methodology and allows experimenta-
tion with multiple parallel devices, experimental setups and
settings. By employing Talon, we perform several critical
experiments, and we are able to not only detect and measure
CDT with average AUC score of 0.78-0.96, but also to pro-
vide signiﬁcant insights about the behavior of CDT entities
and the impact on users’ privacy.
In the hands of privacy
researchers, policy makers and end-users, Talon can be an
invaluable tool for raising awareness and increasing trans-
parency on tracking practices used by the ad-ecosystem.
1 Introduction
Online advertising has become a driving force of the econ-
omy, with digital ad spending already surpassing the spend-
ing for TV-based advertising in 2017 [32], and expected to
reach $327 billion in 2019 [42]. This is because online adver-
tising can be easily tailored to, and target speciﬁc audiences.
In order to personalize ads, advertisers employ various track-
ing practices to collect user behavioral and browsing data.

Figure 1: High level representation of cross-device tracking.
Until recently, the tracking of a user was conﬁned to the
physical boundary of each one of her devices. However,
as users typically own multiple devices [2, 54], advertisers
have started employing advanced targeting practices specif-
ically designed to track and target users across all their de-
vices. These efforts indicate a radical shift of the ad-targeting
paradigm, from device-centric to user-centric. In this new
paradigm, an advertiser tries to identify which devices (e.g.,
smartphone, tablet, laptop) belong to the same user, and then
target her across all devices with ads related to her overall
online behavior. Figure 1 illustrates a typical cross-device
tracking (CDT) scenario, where a user is targeted with rele-
vant ads in her second device (desktop), due to the behavior
exhibited to the ad-ecosystem from her ﬁrst device (mobile).
A recent FTC Staff Report [51] states that CDT can be de-
terministic or probabilistic, and companies engaging in such
practices typically use a mixture of both techniques. Deter-
ministic tracking utilizes 1st-party login services that require
user authentication (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Gmail). These
1st-party services often share information (e.g., a unique
identiﬁer) with 3rd-parties, enabling them to perform a more
effective CDT. In the case of probabilistic CDT, there are
no shared identiﬁers between the users’ devices, and 3rd-
parties attempt to identify which devices belong to the same
user by considering network access data, common behav-
ioral patterns in browsing history, etc. In fact, to understand
the degree to which CDT trackers appear on the Web, we
USENIX Association        22nd International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses 227measured their frequency of appearance on Alexa Top-10k
websites: companies performing probabilistic CDT can be
found in ∼ 27% of the websites, and when also considering
deterministic CDT, this coverage reaches ∼ 80%. Also, sev-
eral advertising companies such as Criteo [16], Tapad [53],
Drawbridge [20] etc., claim that they can track users across
devices with very high accuracy (e.g., Drawbridge’s Cross-
Device connected consumer graph is 97.3% accurate [19]).
In spite of its big impact on user privacy, apart from some
empirical evidence about CDT, there is only a limited work
investigating it. In the most close work to ours, Zimmeck
et al. [56], designed an algorithm that correlates mobile and
desktop devices into pairs by considering devices’ browsing
history and IP addresses. While this approach shows that
correlation of devices is possible when such data are avail-
able, it does not provide an approach for detecting and mea-
suring CDT. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there is no
existing approach to audit the probabilistic CDT ecosystem
and the factors that impact its performance on the Web. Our
work is the ﬁrst to propose a novel methodology that enables
auditing the CDT ecosystem in an automated and systematic
way. In effect, our work takes the ﬁrst and crucial step in un-
derstanding the inner workings of the CDT mechanics and
measure different parameters that affect how it performs.
The methodology proposed in this work is based on the
following idea: we want to detect when CDT trackers suc-
cessfully correlate a user’s devices, by identifying cross-
device targeted behavioral ads they send, i.e., ads that are de-
livered on one device, but have been triggered because of the
user’s browsing on a different device. In order to design this
methodology, we ﬁrst study browsing data of real users with
multiple devices from [56] and extract topics of interest and
other user behavioral patterns. Then, to make trackers cor-
relate the different devices of the end-user and serve cross-
device targeted ads, we employ artiﬁcially created personas
with speciﬁc interests, to emulate realistic browsing activity
across the user devices as extracted from the real data.
We build Talon, a novel framework that materializes our
methodology in order to collect, categorize and analyze all
the ads delivered to the different user devices, and evaluate
with simple and advanced statistical methods the potential
existence of CDT. Through a variety of experiments we are
able to measure CDT with an average AUC of 0.78-0.96.
Speciﬁcally, in the simplest experiment, where the user ex-
hibits signiﬁcant browsing activity mainly from the mobile
device, the average value of AUC is 0.78 for the 10 different
behavioral proﬁles used. When the user exhibits signiﬁcant
browsing activity from both devices (mobile and desktop),
with a matching behavioral proﬁle, we observe CDT with
an average AUC of 0.83. In the case of visiting speciﬁcally
chosen websites that employ multiple known CDT trackers,
we achieve AUC score of 0.96. We also ﬁnd that brows-
ing in incognito can reduce the effect of CDT, but does not
eliminate it, as trackers can perform device matching based
only on the current browsing session of the user, and not all
her browsing history. Finally, we compare the data collected
with our real user-driven artiﬁcial personas (such as CDT
trackers found, types of ads detected, etc.) with correspond-
ing distributions observed in the real user data from [56],
offering a strong validation to the realistic design of Talon.
Overall, our main contributions in this work are:
• Design a novel, real data-driven methodology for detect-
ing CDT by triggering behavioral cross-device targeted
ads on one user device, according to speciﬁcally-crafted
emulated personas, and then detecting those ads when
delivered on a different device of the same user.
• Implement Talon, a practical framework for CDT mea-
surements. Talon has been designed to provide scala-
bility for fast deployment of multiple parallel device in-
stances, to support various experimental setups, and to
be easily extensible.
• Conduct a set of experiments for measuring the potential
existence of CDT in different types of emulated users,
with an average AUC score of 0.78-0.96, and investigate
the various factors that affect its performance under dif-
ferent classes of experimental setups and conﬁgurations.
2 Related Work
The ad-industry continuously develops new mechanisms for
making ads more relevant and effective. Such mechanisms
include the delivery of contextual, targeted-behavioral, and
retargeted ads. However, in order to serve such highly re-
lated ads, advertisers often employ questionable and privacy
intrusive techniques for collecting user information. They
typically apply techniques for tracking user visits across
different websites, which allow them to reconstruct parts
of the users’ browsing history. To that end, numerous
works [48, 34, 39, 43, 17, 46, 45, 47, 44] investigate the
various approaches employed by trackers, and propose pro-
tection mechanisms. Also, a large body of work investi-
gates targeted behavioral advertising with regards to differ-
ent levels of personalization, based on the type of infor-
mation used to target the user [9, 5, 55], and its effective-
ness [25, 35, 26, 12, 7, 29].
Some studies investigate CDT that utilizes technologies
such as ultrasound and Bluetooth, and measure the preva-
lence of such approaches [40, 6, 33]. A study by Brookman
et al. [10] provided initial insights about the prevalence of
CDT on the web, identiﬁed 3rd-party CDT trackers and ex-
amined the transparency of the employed techniques.
Zimmeck et al. [56] conducted a small-scale exploratory
study on CDT based on the observation of cross-device tar-
geted ads in two paired devices using the same IP address
(mobile and desktop) over the course of two months. Fol-
lowing this exploration, they collected real users’ browsing
histories and device information and designed an algorithm
228          22nd International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and DefensesUSENIX Associationthat correlates the devices into pairs. This approach shows
that network information and browsing history can be used
for correlating user devices, and thus potentially for CDT.
In general, research around CDT is still very limited; in
fact, only [56, 10] initially studied some of its aspects, but
without proving its actual existence or providing a methodol-
ogy for detecting and measuring it. Our work builds on these
early studies on CDT, as well as past studies on web tracking,
and proposes a methodology that enables systematic investi-
gation and measurements for detecting probabilistic CDT.
3 A methodology to measure CDT
The proposed methodology emulates realistic browsing ac-
tivity of end-users across different devices, and collects and
categorizes all ads delivered to these devices based on the
intensity of the targeting. Finally, it compares these ads with
baseline browsing activity to establish if CDT is present or
not, at what level, and for which types of user interests.
3.1 Design Principle
In general, the CDT performed by the ad-ecosystem is a very
complex process, with multiple parties involved, and a non-
trivial task to dissect and understand. To infer its internal
mechanics, we rely on probing the ecosystem with consis-
tent and repeatable inputs (I), under speciﬁc experimental
settings (V), allowing the ecosystem to process and use this
input via transformations and modeling (F), and produce out-
puts we can measure on the receiving end (Y):
F−→ Y
(I,V)
In this expression, the unknown F is the probabilistic model-
ing performed by CDT entities, allowing them to track users
across their devices. Following this design principle, our
methodology allows to push realistic input signals to the ad-
ecosystem via website visits, and measure the ecosystem’s
output through the delivered ads, to demonstrate if F enabled
the ecosystem to perform probabilistic CDT. An overview of
our methodology is illustrated in Figure 2.
3.2 Design Overview
3.2.1 Input Signal (I)
To trigger CDT, we ﬁrst need to inject to the ad-ecosystem
some activity from a user’s browsing behavior (I). This input
can be visits (i) to pages of interest (e.g., travel, shopping),
or (ii) to control pages of null interest (e.g., weather pages).
Intuitively, the former can be used ﬁrst to demonstrate par-
ticular behavior of a user from a given device (mobile), and
the latter afterwards for collecting ads delivered as the output
of the ecosystem (Y) due to I, to that device, or other device
of the same user (desktop).
Persona Pages. We extract real users’ interests from the
dataset provided by Zimmeck et al. [56] and leverage an ap-
proach similar to Carrascosa et al. [12] to emulate brows-
ing behavior according to speciﬁc web categories, and cre-
ate multiple, carefully-crafted personas of different granular-
ities. This design makes the methodology systematic and re-
peatable and produces realistic browsing trafﬁc from scripted
browsers. For each persona, our approach identiﬁes a set of
websites (dubbed as persona pages) that have, at the given
time, active ad-campaigns. This “training activity” aims to
drive CDT trackers into possible device-pairing between the
user’s two devices with high degree of conﬁdence.
Control Pages. Following past works [12, 7], all devices
in the system collect ads by visiting neutral websites that
typically serve ads not related to their content, thus, reducing
bias from possible behavioral ads delivered to speciﬁc type
of websites. We refer to these websites as control pages. We
detail the design of personas and control pages in § 4.1.
3.2.2 Experimental Setup (V)
No 1st-party logins. Since we focus on probabilistic CDT,
we assume that the emulated user does not visit or log into
any 1st-party service that employs deterministic CDT and
thus, there is no common identiﬁer (e.g., email address, so-
cial network ID) shared between the user’s devices.
Devices, IP addresses & Activity. The approach we fol-
low is based on triggering and identifying behavioral cross-
device targeted ads, and speciﬁcally ads that appear on one of
the user’s devices, but have been triggered by the user’s ac-
tivity on a different device. For this trigger to be facilitated,
the ad-ecosystem must be provided with hints that these two
devices belong to the same user. Zimmeck et al. [56] suggest
that in many cases, the devices’ IP address is adequate for
matching devices that belong to the same user. Also, accord-
ing to relevant industrial teams [38, 4] more signals can be
used, such as location, browsing, etc., for device matching.
Following these observations, our methodology requires
a minimum of three different devices: one mobile device
and two desktop computers, with two different public IP ad-
dresses. We assume that two devices (i.e., the mobile and one
desktop) belong to the same user, and are connected to the
same network. That is, these devices have the same public
IP address, are active in the same geolocation as in a typical
home network, and will be considered by the ad-ecosystem
as producing trafﬁc from the same user. The second desk-
top (i.e., baseline PC), which has a different IP address, is
used for receiving a different ﬂow of ads while replicating
the browsing of the user’s desktop (i.e., paired PC). This
control instance is used for establishing a baseline set of ads
to compare with the ads received by the user’s paired PC.
CDT Direction. In principle, the design allows the inves-
tigation of both directions of CDT. That is, users may ﬁrst
browse on the mobile device, and then move to their desk-
