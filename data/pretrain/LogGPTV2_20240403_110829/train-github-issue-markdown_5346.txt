Challenge Waypoint: Make Instances of Objects with a Constructor Function has
an issue.

Please describe how to reproduce this issue, and include links to screenshots
if possible.
The description text on the left-side of the page has an error in it. I'll
mention the text here:
    Now, once the myCar instance is created it can be used like any other object and can have its properties accessed and modified the same way you would usually. For example:
    var myCar.turboType = "twin";     // This line has an extra keyword "var", which causes an error.
    Our myCar variable now has a property turboType with a value of "twin".
