**About Me:**
- **Website:** [Irongeek.com](http://Irongeek.com)
- **Professional Role:** Senior Information Security Consultant at TrustedSec
- **Co-Founder:** Derbycon ([Derbycon.com](http://www.derbycon.com))
- **Twitter:** [@Irongeek_ADC](https://twitter.com/Irongeek_ADC)

**Interests:**
- I am passionate about information security (InfoSec) education.
- I acknowledge that I don't know everything; I'm just a dedicated geek with time to explore and learn.

**Perspectives:**
- **Anonymous Users:** People who aim to stay anonymous online.
- **De-anonymizers:** Individuals or entities trying to identify and de-anonymize users.

**Disclaimer:**
- I am not a privacy expert, and I am not a lawyer (IANAL).
- Be cautious of the websites you visit, as some may contain illegal content (contraband).

## Darknets

**Definition:**
- A darknet is an "anonymizing private network" that uses encryption and proxies (and sometimes other peers) to obscure the identities of communicating parties.
- Sometimes referred to as "Cipherspace," which I find to be a compelling term.

## The Onion Router (Tor)

**Who Developed Tor?**
- Initially developed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, then supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and now maintained by the Tor Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. ([TorProject.org](http://www.torproject.org/))

**Why Use Tor?**
- "Tor is free software and an open network that helps defend against network surveillance, protecting personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities, and state security." — As defined on their website.

**What Does Tor Do?**
- Enables access to regular internet sites anonymously.
- Provides access to Tor hidden services.

**How Does Tor Work?**
- Uses a locally run SOCKS proxy to connect to the Tor network.
- Features layered encryption, bi-directional tunnels, and directory servers.
- Primarily focused on out-proxying to the Internet.
- For more information, visit [TorProject.org](https://www.torproject.org).

### Components of the Tor Network

- **Client:** A user of the Tor network.
- **Relays:** Nodes that relay traffic and can act as exit points.
- **Bridges:** Relays that are not listed in the directory servers, making them harder to block.
- **Guard Nodes:** Used to mitigate certain traffic analysis attacks.
- **Introduction Points:** Assist in establishing connections to hidden services.
- **Rendezvous Points:** Facilitate the relaying and establishment of connections to hidden services.

### Pros and Cons of Tor

**Pros:**
- **Versatility:** If it can be tunneled through a SOCKS proxy, almost any protocol can work.
- **Anonymity:** Three layers of proxying, with each node unaware of the previous one, provide strong anonymity.

**Cons:**
- **Speed:** The network can be slow.
- **Trust Issues:** Exit nodes may not always be trustworthy.
- **Infrastructure Vulnerabilities:** In September 2009, China blocked 80% of Tor relays, but bridges helped mitigate this.
- **Detection:** It's relatively easy for server-side administrators to detect Tor usage.

### Port Usage

- **Local Ports:**
  - 9050/tcp: Tor SOCKS proxy
  - 9051/tcp: Tor control port
  - (9150 and 9151 on the Tor Browser Bundle)

- **Remote Ports:**
  - 443/tcp and 80/tcp: Most common
  - Servers may also listen on 9001/tcp, and directory information on 9030.

### Case Study: Bomb Threat at Harvard

- **Incident:** On December 16, 2013, a bomb threat was made to Harvard’s student newspaper and some officials.
- **Method:** The perpetrator used [GuerrillaMail.com](https://www.guerrillamail.com) to send an email after connecting over Tor.
- **Evidence:** Guerrilla Mail added an X-Originating-IP header, revealing the Tor exit point.
- **Outcome:** Eldo Kim, the suspect, was connected to the Tor network around the time the email was sent. He admitted to the threat when interviewed.

### Lessons Learned

- Avoid being the only person using Tor on a monitored network.
- Consider using bridges for added security.
- Be cautious about admitting to any actions.
- Correlation attacks can be very effective.

### DNS Queries

- If you do not use the proxy for DNS, your queries might go to a monitored DNS server, potentially revealing your activity.

### Case Study: Hector Xavier Monsegur (Sabu)

- **Background:** Sabu typically used Tor for IRC but was caught without it once, leading the FBI to his home IP.
- **Collaboration:** After being caught, he started collaborating with the FBI.
- **Interaction with Jeremy Hammond (sup_g):** Jeremy inadvertently provided details about his past arrests and affiliations, narrowing down the suspect pool.
- **FBI Action:** A court order was obtained to monitor Jeremy's communications, leading to further evidence collection.
