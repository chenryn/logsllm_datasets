Question: "In the context of security testing, why would a penetration tester pay special attention to HTTP methods such as PUT and DELETE beyond the commonly used GET and POST methods?"
 "A": "Because PUT and DELETE methods are often not properly secured and, if allowed, can expose vulnerabilities."
 "B": "Because PUT and DELETE methods are newer and less understood than GET and POST, making them inherently more secure."
 "C": "Because PUT and DELETE methods cannot be intercepted by proxies, thus they do not require thorough testing."
 "D": "Because PUT and DELETE methods are typically used for read-only operations, which are not relevant to security testing."
Answer: A
