It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2015 ACM
Workshop Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2015)
— the eight annual workshop addressing technologies that
fuse intelligent systems into computer security applications
and the implications of these approaches. The workshop’s
aim is to advance research at the intersection of artiﬁcial
intelligence, machine learning, privacy and security. In par-
ticular, AISec gives researchers and practitioners working
within one or more of those ﬁelds a platform for interdisci-
plinary discussion, which would otherwise be lacking. Hope-
fully, the workshop leads to a high degree of cross-pollination
between groups working across these areas. The papers
to be presented in this year’s program span topics rang-
ing from adversarial learning, detecting fake OSN accounts,
malware classiﬁcation to privacy preserving data processing
and game theoretic techniques in adversarial learning. We
are delighted to again be co-located with the premier ACM
Computer and Communication Security (CCS 2015) confer-
ence. This year we had 25 submissions from Asia, Europe
and North America. After a rigorous reviewing process, in-
volving at 2-3 referees per paper, 11 papers were accepted
for presentation at the workshop, including presentation-
only papers.
Organizing AISec 2015 was a team eﬀort made possible by
colleagues from institutions around the world. We sincerely
thank the AISec program committee and external reviewers
for their invaluable eﬀorts towards guaranteeing a strong
program, and the authors of papers who provided us with
such excellent material. Their high caliber submissions and
the thoughtful feedback from the reviewers continue to en-
sure the success of the ACM AISec workshop series. Finally,
we wish to thank the ACM CCS organizers, particularly the
workshop chairs Xiaofeng Wang and Kui Ren and CCS Gen-
eral Chair Indrajit ray, for providing us with a suitable fo-
rum and for their continued support of this workshop. We
believe that the workshop program will be interesting not
only for researchers working in the ﬁeld, but also for prac-
titioners and academics in other areas in security. We look
forward to seeing you all in Denver this year.
