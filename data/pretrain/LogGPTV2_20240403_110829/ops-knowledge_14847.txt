User: Is it possible to calculate time of a planet will be closest to the horizon, when pyephem throws AlwaysUpError and NeverUpError?
Assistant: Wouldn't that be the, for lack of a better term, anti-transit?  It seems to me that if it's cicumpolar, what you're looking for would be roughly 12 hours before/after transit.
