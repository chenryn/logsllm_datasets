**Problem** :
At the moment in the documentation page of Flutter, we do not have a button to
navigate to the related dart file in Flutter project. e.g. with
FloatingActionButton, if we want to see the related dart file, we are not able
to navigate easily. We need to go to GitHub and find the related file.
_I know we can see class related data easily but sometimes seeing the overview
of the file is more helpful than usual documentation._
**Solution** :
Adding a GitHub button to navigate to related dart file would be useful.
