User: Would like to know what is the best F/OSS IDE for Python Web development.  I've always used vim myself, but I'm increasingly interested in having a tool that integrates syntax checking/highlighting, source control, debugging, and other IDE goodies.
I use both Windows and Linux as desktops, so recommendations for either platform are welcome!
Thanks,

Assistant: What about IDLE?  It's bundled with Python distributions.
