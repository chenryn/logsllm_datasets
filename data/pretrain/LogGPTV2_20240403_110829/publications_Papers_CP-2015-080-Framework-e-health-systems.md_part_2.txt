rules, etc.). This first challenge requires close collaboration between physicians and knowledge engineers,
because documents are often ambiguous and include “hidden” knowledge. Second, the expected patterns
and rules must be matched with patients' data, and this requires accessing the electronic patient record.
Typically, data are stored in commercial and non-commercial products, requiring the interaction with
different actors and data formats. A third challenge is to convince CfMS users to provide motivations for
their non-compliance, even if this implies admitting some errors.

Innovation and Implications
We propose a novel, double view of careflow compliance based on different formalizations of guidelines
and protocols: a graphical format (flowchart) and production rules (IF condition THEN action). The first
one is used to find mismatches between the mined careflow and the expected process (e.g. a task present
in the mined process but not in the guideline, or different sequences of tasks). Here, compliance is verified
at a general “process” level. Conversely, rules are used to check for compliance at a more specific level, i.e.
for each recommendation in a particular patient’s care process. This allows a healthcare professional to
reason about her/his behavior. In this context, an important issue that has not yet been systematically
considered is how to present the results of non-compliance detection according to its severity degree, also
based on specific healthcare settings. Another innovative aspect is the integration of multiple models.
Although there are studies about multiple GL integration (Abidi 2009), all the existing studies on
guideline compliance investigated only one GL at a time and do not consider the mixture of medical GLs
and administrative regulation. We propose the development of methods to detect non-compliances in
complex careflows, where this mixture is considered. Finally, a further innovation will be provided by a
methodology able to intelligently exploit traces of careflow executions, by retrieving similar ones, and by
automatically organizing them.
Implication 2. Accelerated developments of medical knowledge discovery and management,
development of devices and procedures using in-silico environments.
Careflow Management System
Context and objectives
Careflows are indispensable to better understand how healthcare institutions operate, but one of the
major advantages is to use them to manage patients’ treatments. Once careflows emerge using a process
mining approach, and after a thorough compliance verification, a flexible and compliant CfMS can be
used to guide treatments, be used for patient information integration, and be used to control and
guarantee the compliance of careflows instances with clinical practice GLs, protocols and healthcare
institution’s rules. The creation of a central semantic healthcare ontology will provide a 360º view on
patients. By using semantic domain models, healthcare institutions acquire several benefits, such as the
ability to perform inference and improve the decision-making procedure of healthcare professionals on
the best treatments described by a careflow to follow.
The framework proposes the practical extension and implementation of a CfMS with: a) a flexible engine,
b) a rule engine, and c) patient-based data integration. The flexible engine will provide a guidance mode,
which will enable physicians to deviate from the strict execution of medical activities prescribed by
careflows and, thus, undertake non-prescribed or non-compliant actions when warranted. The rule engine
will support the relaxed execution of careflows using the guiding principle mode, encode clinical practice
GLs, and identify the execution of non-compliance careflow instances.
State-of-the-art and challenges
Current process management systems (Cardoso and van der Aalst, 2009) have been developed as generic
systems (e.g. Oracle Workflow, TIBCO InConcert, WebSphere MQ Workflow, YAWL) to be used in a
broad spectrum of domains. As a result, a first restriction is the limited capacity to use careflows as
blueprints to access data from healthcare systems using established protocols (e.g., HL7 and DICOM),
and integrate the data into healthcare ontologies (e.g., SNOMED and Open Biomedical Ontologies
Foundry). This integration has not been studied in the context of process-aware systems (Dumas et al.,
2005). The development of CfMS with GL-based management can be achieved with the use of rule base
systems (Panzarasa et al., 2007). Early work on the use of business rules and processes appeared after the
introduction of the rule concept (Kappel et al., 1998, Knolmayer et al., 2000). So far, most work has been
done in determining the usefulness of formal representational in workflow modeling, types of rules, rule
consistency, rule reuse, enforcement of rules, and business rule modeling limitations (zur Muehlen and
Indulska, 2010, Rosemann et al., 2006).

Framework for next generation e-health systems and services
Three important challenges need to be addressed. First, the CfMS needs to be able to “speak” and
“understand” XML-based communication languages (e.g., ASTN, DICOM, and HL7) and OWL-based
knowledge representation languages to provide a 360º view on patients. Second, providing a 360º view
on patients requires the merging, alignment, and extension of current ontology developments for
healthcare, which need to be integrated into the core CfMS engine. Third, coupling a business rule engine
for healthcare will enhance the CfMS by enabling it to understand and verify which clinical practice GLs
and protocols are followed at runtime and which violate regulations.
Innovation and Implications
The CfMS proposed by our framework identifies three innovative aspects: a) support for XML and OWL-
based integration, by extending the core careflow engine to support an efficient and (semi-)automated
integration of syntactic information (e.g., healthcare XML-based standards) and semantic knowledge
(healthcare OWL-based ontologies), b) direct use of healthcare ontologies to make better routing and
scheduling decisions, by interoperating with healthcare ontologies to make the system adaptive,
intelligent, and better serve patients by providing a 360º view on them. Valuable knowledge includes
patient care, insurance policies, drug prescriptions, and clinical practices and best practices, and c)
support rule-based guided and flexible enactment of careflows, by coupling a careflow engine with a rule
engine. The formalization of clinical practices and GLs will enable the careflow engine to verify if
instances follow best practices. This support for compliance is important since the costs for not providing
a proper care are high (Perrier et al., 2008).
Implication 3. Improved interoperability of biomedical information and knowledge.
Careflow BI
Context and objectives
As careflow instances are executed by the CfMS, the generation and tracking of KPIs is fundamental for
doctors and hospital administrators to take corrective actions. In the framework we suggest to: a) study
the functional and non-functional requirements for careflow analysis by the actors of a healthcare
institution (e.g., physicians, nurses, and hospital managers), b) design a data warehouse for careflow data,
the associated patient data, and business data, and c) develop methods to analyze and mine data in order
to evaluate careflows, detect deviations and similarities. The careflow BI system will automatically
produce pre-specified reports, continuously feed dashboards with KPI values and support interactive
analysis.
While business intelligence methods have been applied with great success to commercial organizations,
their applicability to variable, low structured, multidisciplinary processes, has not been studied to a great
extent. Careflows are processes with specific characteristics. First, there is no strict process model for a
careflow since each patient is an individual case. Careflows are driven by the physicians’ experiences and
best practices. Second, careflows are orthogonal to the business processes of a healthcare institution but
influence the KPIs as well. Third, careflows as a whole but also their single activities are associated to
different types of data, ranging from unstructured data such as texts or high-resolution images to
structured data such as encoded patient information. In the framework, we propose to (1) identify
careflow-based KPIs which are used to improve decisions of the actors in a hospital such as physicians,
nurses, managers, and technical personal, (2) identify dimensions in the available metadata (such as
patient, disease-specific and organizational information) to classify careflows and allow for a combination
with other measures, (3) design a representation for KPIs over non-uniform processes, (4) develop
methods that calculate these KPIs, (5) develop real-time algorithms for grouping and KPI calculation to
enable interactive careflow analysis.
State-of-the-art and challenges
Data Warehousing (DW) and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) have been used for the integration
and consolidation of multi-dimensional data analysis to provide fast and timely data analyses. In
DW/OLAP architectures (Inmon, 2005; Kimball et al, 2008), data are pulled from data sources and

Framework for next generation e-health systems and services
prepared for the DW through an ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) process. Ongoing research is
directed towards living or real-time data warehouses (BIRTE, 2008), where changes in the source data
are quickly propagated to the data warehouse, which thus contains current data. Data warehousing and
OLAP has been traditionally applied to business data, which has led to the term Business Intelligence. In
principle OLAP can be applied to all quantitative measures that can be classified into dimensions with
different levels of granularity. Little research has been directed towards analysis and monitoring of
processes (Grigori et al, 2004, Deutch, 2008, Beeri et al, 2007). Deutch (2008) has developed models for
traces of web-based applications and a query language that allows querying the structure of the traces.
Grigori et al. (2004) have developed methods and a tool for analysis and mining of business processes
with known process models. Beeri et al, (2007) have designed a query language for monitoring business
processes. All approaches base the analysis on known processes, which are modeled either in process
modeling language like BPEL or directly in a web-based application.
We identify three major challenges. Firstly, meaningful similarity measures need to be developed for the
grouping of ad-hoc careflows along different dimensions such as process and patient characteristics.
Secondly, analysis methods and representations for the analysis’ results for groups of heterogeneous
careflows are needed. Finally, the analysis algorithms have to be fast enough to support interactive data
analysis and should therefore use a fast main-memory data management system.
Innovation and Implications
The Careflow BI component proposed by in framework goes beyond the state of the art in three aspects:
First, it allows analyzing less-structured careflow processes together with business and patient’s data. A
careflow-driven analysis groups careflows that are similar according to some careflow-specific
characteristics and enables their comparison. Second, the KPI representation has to reflect the
heterogeneity of the group of careflow processes it has been calculated for. Finally, since the user could
specify a new classification of the set of heterogeneous processes on analysis time, the Careflow BI
component has to support online classification and analysis.
Implication 4. Increased acceptance and use of realistic and validated models that allow researchers
from different disciplines to exploit, share resources and develop new knowledge.
Careflow Collaborative Platform
Context and objectives
The four previous scientific and technological advancements create a wealth of healthcare information
and knowledge. Mined careflows, worldwide best practices, treatment guidelines, and KPI indicators
which are indispensable for decision-making need to be shared across healthcare departments.
Introducing social networking capabilities into healthcare institutions changes the way information can
be discovered, consumed, and delivered by caregivers. For example, doctors, nurses and administrators
can create social networks of peers or join social networks of other healthcare professionals to share
experience about adopted careflows, current performance indicators, and discuss the 360º data view of
patients. Therefore, the framework provides a careflow collaborative platform, whose design exploits
ideas and concepts emerging from social networks and social environments to create synergies that are
yet to be described and quantified.
A careflow collaborative platform, which enables collaboration among all the organizational units, within
a single healthcare institution or across institutions that are cooperating in the care delivery process of a
same patient needs to be available. On the other hand, there is the need to create so-called “social
communities of practice” for specific medical areas. For example, the platform can allow doctors to
explain their decisions when they are not compliant with GLs. The systematic collection of these
explanations is a means to continuously improve GLs implementation and versioning. Similarly, the
community for a given specialty can view, comment, share, analyze compliance, and propose changes to
recently mined careflows. Nurses can review the latest recommendations for treatments and be up-to-date
on the most appropriate way to assist patients. Hospital administrators can be kept appraised of the
