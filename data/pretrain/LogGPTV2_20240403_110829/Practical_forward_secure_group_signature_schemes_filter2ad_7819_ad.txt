members stay anonymous and unlinkable. This scheme also
supports backward unlinkability for the revoked member

Moreover, with O(logT ) storage overhead, we can extend
Scheme II to allow a time-limited revocation, i.e.
to re-
voke a group member’s signatures only during some periods
of time. The basic idea is that instead of generating the se-
quence eu,0, . . . , eu,T using a one-way chain, we can generate
the sequence using a top-down one-way tree. The squence
eu,0, . . . , eu,T forms the leaf nodes in the top-down one-way
tree. Knowing the root, one can generate the entire tree;
and knowing an internal node, one can generate the entire
subtree but not any other nodes in the tree. Thus, when the
group manager only wants to revoke a group member U ’s
signature from time period t1 to time period t2, he reveals
the internal nodes that serve as the roots of the subtrees
that cover the time periods from t1 to t2. Thus any user
can compute eu,i for t1 ≤ i ≤ t2 and therefore can check
whether a signature is revoked.
6. DISCUSSION
Our two forward secure group signature schemes are both
based on the group signature scheme proposed in [3] and
use diﬀerent one-way function for evolving the group sign-
ing keys to achieve forward security. The two schemes have
7
diﬀerent performance and security tradeoﬀs. Scheme I has
eﬃcient EVOLVE procedure (only requiring a squaring),
although the signing and veriﬁcation are less eﬃcient (re-
quiring O(T ) squaring). Scheme II has eﬃcient signing and
veriﬁcation procedure and has no extra overhead compar-
ing to the non-forward-secure group signature scheme in [3].
But Scheme II has less eﬃcient EVOLVE procedure (requir-
ing O(T ) exponentiations), although similar techniques as
in [24] can be used to reduce the overhead with a storage
space tradeoﬀ. Scheme II can also achieve a more ﬂexible
time-limited group membership than Scheme I. Scheme II
supports strong forward security and Scheme I can only be
proven satisfying weak forward security. Scheme II has a
much more eﬃcient revocation mechanism than Scheme I
and requires no new cryptographic assumptions for security
while Scheme I requires a new assumption for revocation
with backward unlinkability. Note that both two schemes
also satisfy an interesting property that even if an attacker
learns a group member U ’s group signing key for time period
i, he still cannot identify which signatures generated before
time period i were generated by U , i.e. all U ’s signatures
before time period i still remain anonymous and unlinkable.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we present our forward-secure group sig-
nature schemes. Our schemes satisfy forward security as
well as all the traditional security properties shared with
previous group signature schemes. Our schemes are eﬃ-
cient in the sense that they are independent of the num-
ber of group members and the size of signatures and group
keys are independent on the number of time periods dur-
ing the lifetime of the group public key.
In addition, we
extend our schemes to provide the ﬁrst solutions to enable
retroactive-publicly-revokable group membership with back-
ward unlinkability and the signature size is independent of
the number of revoked members.
Our approach illustrates that forward security is a par-
ticularly important property for group signature schemes,
not only because the danger of the exposure of signing keys
escalates as the group size increases, but also because for-
ward security help enable other desired security properties
at little extra cost, such as time-limited group membership
and retroactive revocation. Our forward secure group signa-
ture schemes also have a side beneﬁt that even if an attacker
learns a group member U ’s group signing key for time period
i, he still cannot identify which signatures generated before
time period i were generated by U , i.e. all U ’s signatures
before time period i still remain anonymous and unlinkable.

A. SECURITY ANALYSIS
We provide here the proofs of the lemmas stated in the
paper. The proofs are related to proofs in [3]. The proof for
Lemma 3 is similar to the proof in Lemma 2. The proofs for
Lemma 4 and 5 and are similar to the proofs in [3]. Corollary
1 and 2 can be easily proven from the lemmas. Therefore
we omit the proofs for Lemma 2, 4 and 5 and Corollary 1
and 2 here.
Lemma 1. PK{(α, β, δ, ) : d2 = (A2T −j+1
)α(1/(g2))δ∧β ∈ Γ∧α ∈ Λ}(m)
∧B2 = (g2)∧1 = (B2T −j+1
is a statistical zero-knowledge proof of knowledge of a group
signing key valid for time period j.
)α(1/(a2))β(1/(y2))δ
Proof sketch. It is easy to see that the protocol is sta-
tistical zero-knowledge. Now we show how to build a knowl-
edge extractor for the group signing key. Under the proper-
ties of the PK protocols and under the strong RSA assump-
tion, the knowledge extractor can produce values α, β, δ, 
such that the statement after the colon holds. In particular

232from B2 = (g2) and 1 = (B2T−j+1
)α(1/(g2))δ, we get that
δ ≡ 2T−jα mod ord(g). Furthermore, we have d2(a2)β =
α. As β ∈ Γ, α ∈ Λ,
(A2T−j+1
we see that (A2/(y2), α, β, γ) is a valid group signing key
for time period j. Hence the signer must know a valid group
signing key for time period j.

Lemma 2. In Scheme I, under the strong RSA assumption,
a group signing key for some time period t, (xu, eu, cu) where
= daxu mod n and xu ∈ Γ, and eu ∈ Λ, can only

be generated by the group manager given that the number of
group signing keys the group manager issues is polynomially
bounded.
i mod n.
Proof sketch. Let M be an attacker that is allowed
to adaptively run the JOIN procedure and thereby obtain
group signing keys {(xi, ei, ci)}1≤i≤K where d = axi cei
We show in the following that if M outputs a tuple (ˆx, ˆe, ˆc, t)
with ˆx ∈ Γ, ˆe ∈ Λ, daˆx = ˆc2T −t ˆe mod n, and (ˆx, ˆe) (cid:18)= (xi, ei)
for all 1 ≤ i ≤ K, i.e. a new group signing key valid for time
period t, with non-negligible probability, then we can use
M to break the strong RSA assumption.
Given a pair (n, z), where n is the product of two safe
primes and z ∈ QRn and we would like to solve the strong
