Hi all,
In my Electron app, I capture navigation events from a webview in the main
window and display the contents in a second window.
Capturing the event and displaying the selected contents in the second window
using `webview.addEventListener('will-navigate', ...)` and some
renderer->main->renderer ipc works just fine, but I haven't been able to
prevent the main window webview from also loading the linked page contents,
despite calling `Event.preventDefault()` and `Event.stopPropagation()`. I'm
aware of issue #4191 and others that have reported this before, but if there's
a fix or a workaround for this problem, I haven't found one.
The following complete code is supposed to ignore all navigation events and
leave the original page in place, but instead it replaces it with the
navigated page contents every time.
**app.js** :
    const {app, BrowserWindow} = require('electron')
    app.on('ready', () => {
        let win = new BrowserWindow({width: 800, height: 600})
        win.loadURL('file://' + __dirname + '/app.html')
        win.on('closed', () => app.quit())
    })
**app.html** :
        Navigate
Am I missing something?
Environment:
