### Alternative Methods to Circumvent Traffic-Analysis Attacks and Censorship

Beyond geographical avoidance, there are several methods to circumvent the threats of traffic-analysis attacks and censorship. These include sophisticated path selection in Tor and traffic obfuscation techniques.

#### A. Path Selection

Tor's path selection mechanism dynamically chooses relays based on their available bandwidth, preferring nodes with better performance. This not only affects the user experience but also impacts the anonymity set [6], [15], [23]. Recent research has proposed various strategies to enhance Tor's circuit establishment, such as better congestion management [20], [48], which can improve load balancing and increase the number of relay candidates for a circuit.

Another critical factor is the role of autonomous systems (AS) [4], [8], [14], [22]. An AS-level adversary can perform powerful traffic-analysis attacks. Similar to geographical avoidance, AS awareness aims to circumvent untrusted areas, but the analysis must be conducted at a different layer of the network stack.

#### B. Censorship Circumvention

Geographical avoidance is an indirect solution to Internet censorship and traffic-analysis attacks. Two alternative approaches are decoy routing and pluggable transports.

**Decoy Routing:**
Decoy routing [16], [24], [55] bypasses censorship by routing critical traffic through servers outside the censored area. In this scenario, we assume a user is in a country where specific sites are blocked. Decoy routers provide access to content that is tolerated by the censor, acting as a man-in-the-middle to forward requests to blocked sites and return the content to the client, all while obfuscating the actual payload. Countermeasures like RAD (routing around decoys) [41] attempt to neutralize decoy routers by forcing alternate routes. While decoy routing is effective, it does not address routing attacks and potential consequences from traffic analysis.

**Pluggable Transports:**
Pluggable transports [10], [35], [53] offer another method of censorship circumvention by making Tor traffic appear as other, benign protocols that are not targets of blocking or monitoring. Despite their effectiveness, pluggable transports cannot guarantee secure routes. However, they make it more difficult for adversaries to learn sensitive information from traffic metadata. Random patterns in obfuscation help disrupt the relationship between traffic streams, making it harder to detect a connection to Tor, though they do not protect against routing attacks.

### Conclusion

In this work, we evaluated the challenges of geographical avoidance for data transmissions and introduced a novel empirical avoidance concept. Our approach considers hop-individual transmission characteristics rather than static thresholds, reducing the collateral damage from overly restrictive avoidance decisions. In a two-part experimental study, our concept outperformed existing methods by rejecting 22% fewer circuits and maintaining an average of 27 MB/s more advertised bandwidth. We also developed TrilateraTor, a prototype implementation that addresses real-world deployment requirements and the diverse network infrastructure of Tor, providing practical geographical avoidance and overcoming fundamental security issues of prior systems.
