User: I tested my project in my local machine, and it worked fine. But after uploading to a remote server(CentOS), I cannot execute celerybeat.
Here is my command.
python manage.py celeryd --events --loglevel=INFO -c 5 --settings=[settings-directory].production
This command works in the local machine(with --settings=[settings-directory].local), but in the remote server, ImportError: cannot import name celeryd occured.
Setting about celery is in base.py. local.py and production.py import the file. In production.py, there are just DEBUG, static, database settings.
I can import djcelery and celery in shell of the remote machine.
How could I solve this?

I think this is a version problem.. I'm reading about celery3.1
Assistant: It turned out I used different version of Django in my remote server.
In Celery 3.1, there is no command named celeryd.
