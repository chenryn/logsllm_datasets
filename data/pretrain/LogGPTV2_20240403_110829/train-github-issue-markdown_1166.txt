### Expected Behavior
When calling `webContents.print` and cancelling the native print dialog the
callback should be called directly.
### Actual Behavior
The callback is called after (during?) the window is closed/destroyed.
### To Reproduce
    const win = ...
    win.webContents.print({ printBackground: true }, () => {
        log('Printing finished')
        // ...
    })

The crash in the example happened because the window is destroyed and the
callback is called, which normally removes stuff from the window.
