Question: An Android device is being prepared for deployment in a high-security environment. The security team is debating whether to set SELinux to 'Permissive' or 'Enforcing' mode. What are the implications of deploying the device with SELinux set to 'Permissive' mode?
"A": "In 'Permissive' mode, the security policy is enforced but not logged, potentially leading to unnoticed security breaches.",
"B": "In 'Permissive' mode, the security policy is not enforced, only logged, which can be useful for identifying potential failures without impacting system functionality.",
"C": "In 'Permissive' mode, devices become immune to EPERM errors since no policy enforcement takes place.",
"D": "In 'Permissive' mode, the security policy is both enforced and logged, with failures appearing as EPERM errors, offering the highest level of security."
Answer: B
