We do this by issuing the command:
db_import my.xml
A quick check of the host commands shows that our import is successful and
Metasploit now has the nmap data.
We will also issue the services command to view the services available within
Metasploit. The following is an example output of the service command:

Server-side Attacks
You can perform scanning for nmap and importing the XML file into the Metasploit
database in one step by using the command db_nmap. In the following example, we
are using db_nmap to scan a host using the nmap commands.
We can verify that Metasploit has the relevant information in its database issuing
the hosts and services commands.
The services command reveals we are using Samba file sharing. Let's see if we can
search for an exploit and take advantage of this. It is important to note that although
we are attacking a real web server in this instance, we don't necessarily need to try
to exploit a web vulnerability. Real attackers will take advantage of all the software
running on a web server to access information.
We see several Samba exploits available. They also have rankings. We will use
the usermap_script exploit with an excellent rating. This module exploits the
command execution vulnerability in Samba Versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3.
More information about this exploit can be found at http://www.metasploit.com/
modules/exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script.

To use a specific exploit, we issue the use command. In this case:
Once an exploit is selected, we need to see what information is required before
we can execute the selected exploit. We do this by identifying the required
options listed in the output and selecting a payload we want to deliver. We
issue the command show options to view the required options:
[ 99 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
We can see from this example that we need an RHOST entry. RHOST is the IP address
of the remote host we are attacking. We also need to select the payload and set the
payload options. A payload is code that injects itself and runs the exploit. Since
the same vulnerability can exist using multiple methods, we can possibly have
multiple payloads to choose from. To see the available payloads, issue the show
payloads command.
Once we see a payload that we want to use, the next step is to use the set payload
command and put in the patch name of the payload we see.
[ 100 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
Once the payload is set, we can issue the show options command again to verify the
options specific to the payload.
We can see this specific payload is asking us to set the LHOST and the LPORT. The
LHOST is the local host or your Metasploit attacker box. The exploit makes the remote
host connect back to the system hosting Metasploit, so the remote host needs to
know what your IP address is.
In addition, we need to set the port the remote host will use to communicate with
Metasploit. Many corporate environments restrict outbound ports using a firewall
or router. Best practice is to use a common port such as port 443, since it is usually
reserved for SSL traffic, which most corporations allow outbound. Also, another
benefit of using port 443 is that most organizations do not inspect SSL. We find that
using 443 as a LPORT for most attacks allows us to bypass internal proxy tools an
organization may have deployed.

Server-side Attacks
When we are done setting our options, we can type, exploit to run the attack. When
the exploit runs successfully, you will be connected to the remote server. You can
run any command and in this example, this particular exploit gives root access. Root
access means full access to your target remote server.
There are various exploit and payload options available in the Metasploit framework.
Make sure to review the available options at http://www.metasploit.com/.
w3af
w3af (short for Web Application Attack and Audit Framework) is an open-source
web application security scanner and exploitation tool. W3af can be accessed under
Web Application Assessment | Web Vulnerability Scanners by selecting w3af.
[ 102 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
w3af offers a wizard; however, it is not necessary to properly execute a scan. The first
step is either creating a new profile or leveraging an existing profile. Profiles are used
to group plugins that will be run on a target. w3af comes with some great default
groups such as OWASP TOP10. Definitions of existing plugins will be displayed in
the center window as you select them such as the following example of the OWASP
TOP10 profile. You can select an existing profile or your new profile that you just
created in the left column. If you are using a new profile or editing an existing
profile, you can check the box for any plugins you want to scan. The more plugins
you check, the longer the scan will take. w3af will warn you of possible long delays
if you check a large group. Click on Start to run the scan.
Next, enter the target URL in the Target: field and click on Start to run the scan. The
following screenshot shows setting up w3af to scan www.thesecurityblogger.com:

w3af will show the status of an active scan in the Log window. w3af will attempt to
predict the length of time required to complete the scan.
To see the results from a scan, click on the Results tab. Results will provide the
details of what possible vulnerabilities were identified. The Exploit tab will show
the possible exploits based on the vulnerabilities discovered.
[ 104 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
w3af allows users to exploit vulnerabilities identified during the audit phase. As
vulnerabilities are found, they are stored in specific locations of the knowledge base,
from which exploit plugins can read from and use that information to exploit the
vulnerability. If the exploit is successful, you will get a shell on the target system. The
following screenshot shows www.ntew3af exploiting the dayShell vulnerability on
www.thesecurityblogger.com.
There are a lot more useful features in the w3af toolset. You can learn more at

Exploiting e-mail systems
By nature, all the e-mail systems sit on the Internet and allow external anonymous
access from the outside world in order to be productive. Users in many organizations
send sensitive information over e-mail. In most environments, e-mail servers hold
valuable information making them a high priority target for attackers. The good
news for consumers is that correctly configured modern e-mail systems are extremely
difficult to exploit. This does not mean e-mail systems are not vulnerable to attacks
since most e-mail systems have web applications and are accessed through a web
interface. This promotes the possibility of a remote attacker gaining access to a core
system that could be leveraged as a jumping point to other internal systems.
[ 105 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
Before we target mail servers, it is important to know what systems are hosting the
mail servers. If you do not have this information, you can use the Reconnaissance
techniques we learned in Chapter 2, Reconnaissance. In this example, we used
fierce to determine the MX hosts for a particular domain. In most cases the MX
host is the SMTP server. The following screenshot is running Fierce on
www.cloudcentrics.com:
First we need to see if the mail server is vulnerable to direct commands. The main
purpose for which most attackers want to exploit mail servers is to spoof e-mails
and use the e-mail server as an unauthorized e-mail relay server. This book will
cover more on how compromised e-mail servers can be used for social engineering
attacks in Chapter 4, Client-side Attacks.
In this example, we will use Netcat as the tool to connect to the mail server. Netcat is
a computer networking service for reading from and writing to network connections
using TCP or UDP. Netcat is designed to be a dependable "back-end" device that
can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. Netcat is also
a feature-rich network debugging and investigation tool with the ability to produce
almost any kind of correlation using a number of built-in capabilities.
A common method to launch Netcat is issuing the command netcat mail-server
port. In this example, our mail server target is running servers over port 25. We
verified this information by using nmap during the Reconnaissance steps described
in Chapter 2, Reconnaissance.
Once we connect to the server using Netcat, we use the HELO command to tell the
server who we are.
[ 106 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
If we receive a response, we can manipulate most servers using the SMTP commands
(some systems may not be vulnerable based on configuration and system type). In the
following example, we start by telling the server who we are using the HELO command.
Next, we can use the mail server to relay messages for future client-side attacks.
HELO, MAIL FROM, RCP To, and Data are the only required fields. You can use other
fields to hide who the e-mail is being sent to and change the reply to address. An
example is changing the Reply to address with the goal of tricking a receiver into
sending an e-mail to someone else.
A full list of the SMTP commands can be found through the SMTP RFC commands
or using Google.
Brute-force attacks
A brute-force attack is when all possible keys are checked against encrypted data until
the right key is found. Brute-force attacks are extremely costly from a resource and
time perspective because the attacker is exploiting vulnerabilities in the encryption by
taking advantage of key length and simplicity of the key. A password is often based
on dictionary words meaning the total space an attacker would have to test would be
all words in a matching dictionary making the guessing scope significantly smaller
than a password using random characters. Best practice to mitigate brute-force attacks
is using long and complicated keys as well as timeouts after a number of attempts and
other methods to add more security factors.
Hydra
Hydra is a tool developed by The Hacker's Choice (THC) that uses the brute-force
attack method to test against a variety of different protocols. It is ideal for attacking
e-mail systems because Hydra can target a specific IP and protocol such as the admin
account for POP3 and SMTP used by the e-mail systems.
Prior to launching Hydra, you should perform Reconnaissance on a target such as a
mail system. Chapter 2, Reconnaissance, covers a vulnerability assessment tool Zenmap
that can be used to gather the following information for Hydra:
• The target's IP address (for example, 192.168.1.1)
• Open Ports (for example, port 80 or 25)
• Protocol (for example, HTTP for web or SMTP for mail)
• User name (for example, admin)
[ 107 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
Another Reconnaissance tool that is often used with Hydra is the Firefox plugin
Tamper Data.
Tamper Data is a tool written by Adam Judson that allows an attacker to view HTTP
and HTTPS GET and POST information. This information is useful when using tools
such as Hydra to brute-force web forms since you can automate Hydra into opening
the webpage and testing the different username and password combinations.
Once we enable the Tamper Data plugin, we can launch the plugin and start it
before we submit a name into a web form.
[ 108 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
Tamper Data will display information entered in the field groups. Attackers can
manipulate and resubmit that data even if the website is encrypted.
In this example, we see that the username pink and the password pinkprincess are
used when the login button was submitted.
Both these examples are two practical ways to perform Reconnaissance on a target to
gather the useful information Hydra will need. There are a plenty of other methods
and built-in tools in Kali to gather web information to use in Hydra; however, we
recommend Netcat and Tamper Data as the most effective methods.
Now that we have completed our Reconnaissance phase, let's launch Hydra and
see how we can use our Reconnaissance information to perform a brute-force
password attack.
To access Hydra from the Kali, go to Password Attacks | Online Attacks and select
Hydra. This will open a Terminal window that will auto launch Hydra.
[ 109 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
The opening documentation explains how to run Hydra. For example, if you want
to attack an admin account's password file located at 192.168.1.1 using SMTP,
you would type:
hydra -l admin -p /root/password.txt 192.168.1.1 smtp
If you would like to use Hydra on a web form, we will need to gather the
information we collected from the Tamper Data plugin. The syntax for using Hydra
on a web form is ::.
URL=https://www.facebook.com/login.php?login_attempt=1email=pink&passw
d=pinkprincessl&login="log in"
You can then run Hydra. You will need to provide a file that contains a list of
usernames and a file that contains passwords.
hydra -L /cloudcentrics/usernamelist -P /cloudcentrics/passwords_demo_
file.txtt -facebook.com http-get-form "login.php?login_attempt=1:username
=^EMAIL^&TOKEN=^PASSWORD^&login=Login:incorrect"
The syntax can get complicated and change from site to site. This can happen on the
same site as well. It's recommended to master Tamper Data and Hydra in a lab prior
to performing live Penetration Testing.
DirBuster
DirBuster is designed to brute-force directories and filenames on web application
servers. It is common that web servers present themselves as a default installation
state, however applications and pages are actually hidden within. DirBuster is
designed to seek out these hidden factors.
DirBuster can be found under Web Applications | Web Crawlers as dirbuster. Once
opened, there are fields that must be filled in before starting an attack. At the very
least, you must enter a target URL, select the number of threads (we suggest maxing
this out at 100), and the files list. You can click on Browse and select the default list
or develop your own.
[ 110 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
Note that some versions of Kali may not include the default dictionaries.
You can download the default dictionaries online and point DirBuster to
them as shown in the following example:
Once you fill in the basic information, click on Start and DirBuster will start the
vulnerability assessment. Most likely, it will state that the completion time is a few
days; however, you usually will find useful data within minutes. The following
screenshot identifies a /cgi-bin/ folder that could be interesting:
[ 111 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
Any code other than 404 is open to brute-force. To target the /cbi-bin/ folder
found during the scan, click on Stop to end the scan and click on Back. On the main
dashboard, above Start, is a field for selecting the starting point of the vulnerability
assessment. To start inside the /cbi-bin/ folder, place that text in that field and click
on Start.
Most likely, you will find more folders within folders to evaluate. Continue the
same process of stopping, updating the start field, and executing scans to map
out your target. The following screenshot shows a tree view of mapping into the
cgi-bin folder:

You can click on the Report button to generate a report of your findings. You need to
select where to save the report and click on Generate Report. A text file will pop up
showcasing what was found.
WebSlayer
WebSlayer is a web application brute-force tool. WebSlayer can be used to brute-
force the Form (User/Password), GET, and POST parameters. WebSlayer can also
be used to identify resources not linked such as scripts, files, directories, and so on.
WebSlayer has a payload generator and results analyzer.
[ 113 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
In the Attack Setup tab there is an url field, which must be filled with the target
URI. Below the URL field are the Headers and POST data input fields. There is
an option to set the payload type, which can be Dictionary, Range, or Payload.
The Dictionary can be a file containing payloads, which can be a custom file
or selected from a list of available dictionaries. The Range setting can be used to
specify the range for the attack. The Payload setting can import a payload from the
Payload Generator tab. The following screenshot shows WebSlayer targeting www.
thesecurityblogger.com:
The payload generator is a tool that you can use to create custom payloads. You
can load dictionaries, numeric ranges, character blocks, permutations, credit cards,
usernames, and other settings. You can concatenate and create a final payload that
can be uploaded into the attack tab for a customized attack.
An example of defining a range payload in the Payload Generator tab can be seen
in the following screenshot. The example shows setting the range payload from 0 to
1000. Once the range is selected, we click on the add generator button, which will
generate a Temporal Generator. Drag the newly created generator to the Payload
Creator at the bottom and click on Generate Payload. We can now import the new
payload in the Attack Setup tab.
[ 114 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
After importing the payload into the attack scenario or selecting default dictionaries,
you must select where the payload will be injected by WebSlayer. Placing the keyword
FUZZ on the URL being attacked does this. For example, the following screenshot
shows the target http://www.thesecurityblogger.com/FUZZ in the attack URI field
where FUZZ is an attack leveraging two existing dictionaries found in WebSlayer:
[ 115 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Server-side Attacks
WebSlayer can attack any part of the HTTP request such as headers and
authentication. In order for WebSlayer to brute-force the password of a web
server, it is important to know the username or most likely WebSlayer will not
work. You will need to capture HTTP requests and attempt a login so that you
can grab the user agent and content needed for the attack.
Firefox offers a plugin called Live HTTP Headers, which you can use to gather this
information while attempting a login to your target server. The following example
shows user joeymuniz using a bad password while capturing packets with live
HTTP headers.
[ 116 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 3
The important parts of information captured from the Live HTTP Headers
used in WebSlayer are the User-Agent and Login Credentials as shown in the
following examples:
The user agent information would go in the headers section and login information
would go in the post data section. The URL should match the login page. The
Authentication section provides different levels of security and a space for
the username.
