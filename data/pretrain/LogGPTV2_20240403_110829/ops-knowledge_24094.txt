User: Is there a way that I can use Python on Windows to execute shell scripts which are located on a remote Unix machine?
P.S: Sorry about the late edit. I do know of Paramiko, but I wanted to know if there is way of doing it without it. For starters, could it be done with subprocess()?
Assistant: You will either need to run some sort of server on the remote machine, or ssh in and do it yourself. It would not be difficult to use one of the many pre-written Python servers to listen for a client and kick off a shell script.
Authentication may or may not be a problem for you; be aware that anyone else can follow the same steps you do and possibly get the same result. You don't want to allow anyone on the intarwubs to start your scripts!
