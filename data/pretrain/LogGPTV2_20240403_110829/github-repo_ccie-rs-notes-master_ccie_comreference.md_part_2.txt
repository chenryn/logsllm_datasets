## TFTP Server
Enable TFTP using **tftp-server** command, which has several arguments. Can specify memory region (typically flash), file name, ACL for which hosts have access to file. Example would be **tftp-server flash:c1700-advipservicesk9-mz.124-23.bin alias supersecretfile.bin 11**
## SCP Server
```

```
## HTTP and HTTPS
Enable HTTP with **ip http server**. Specify port with **ip http port**. Restrict with **ip http access-class. **Specify unique username and password with **ip http client username ** and **ip http client password** commands. Can also auth with others **ip http authentication [ aaa | local | enable | tacacs ]**
Enable HTTPS using **ip http secure-server. **When configured on 12.4 IOS or later, automatically disables HTTP access. Can specify cipher suite of choice too. The **show ip http server secure status** shows what is in use for cipher suites and other info.
## telnet
**login** command or a variation (eg login local) configured under VTY line. Can use rotary groups
## SSH
1. Configure a hostname using **hostname** command
2. Configure a domain name using **ip domain-name** command
3. Configure RSA keys using **crypto key generate rsa**
4. Configure terminal lines to permit SSH with **transport input ssh**
Can also use rotary lines like telnet.
# IP Forwarding
## CEF
- ip cef - Enables cef for all interfaces
- ipv6 cef - activates v6 CEF support, v4 CEF must be active to enable
- no ip route-cache cef - disables CEF on an interface
## CEF Load Sharing
 **ip load-share { per-destination | per packet }**. - Per interface
 ID (read on polarization) can be specified in **ip cef load-sharing algorithm** and **ipv6 load-sharing algorithm**. Also used to select algorithm.
 **mls ip cef load-sharing** on Cat6500 platforms
 ## VLAN Allocation policy
 On Cat switches support extended VLAN range, depending on setting of **vlan internal allocation policy { ascending | descending }**. If ascending, internal VLANS allocated from 1006 and up. If descending, 4094 and down. Important for routed interfaces (using internal VLANs on MLS)
  **show vlan internal usage**
## L3 Port Channel
Port channel can be L3, picks up the no switchport command from physical interfaces that are placed into bond. Cannot change once configured, need to remove all interfaces then reconfigure.
## Policy routing
The ** route-map **specified in this command is what decides on the routing.
Either no match or a deny in route-map statement causes packets to be forwarded by destination routing
Can match in route map with ** match ip address **or **match ipv6 address** or packet length (**match length**)
- set ip next-hop or ipv6 next hop - Next hop must be in connected subnet, forwards to first address in list for which associated interface is up
- set ip(v6) default next-hop - Same as above, except standard routing done first (default route ignored)
- set interface - Forwards on first interface in list that is up, recommended only for P2P interfaces
- set default interface - As above, tries to route first
- set ip df - Sets DF bit (0 or 1)
- set ip(v6) precedence - Set IPP bits
- set ip tos - Sets ToS bits, can be decimal value or ASCII name
# RIP
## Broadcast rather than multicast advertisement
**ip rip v2-broadcast**
## Split Horizon
Split Horizon enabled by default on Cisco RIPv2 interfaces, except FR and ATM. Verified with **show ip interface**, SH with Poisoned Reverse not in Cisco RIPv2
## Show RIP database
```
show ip rip database
```
## Enabling RIP and effects of autosummarization
```
router rip
 version 2
 network 172.31.0.0
```
Turn off auto summary with **no auto-summary**
## Authenticaiton
Authentication can be clear text or MD5, enabled per interface. Multiple keys allowed, grouped as a keychain, can make available at certain times. Enable with **ip rip authentication key-chain name**. Lowest sequence number used if multiple keys valid. Type chosen with **ip rip authentication mode { text | md5 }**
## Split Horizon
```
int Fa0/0
 ip split-horizon
```
Default on interfaces except FR and ATM when configured with an IP on their interfaces
## Offset lists
Adds a route metric, refers to ACL to match routes, adds specified offset, specified in/out direction, and optionally an interfaces
## Filtering routes
Use **distribute-list** under router ip, preference ACL or prefix-list. In or out, or per interface
## RIPng
- Auth or enryption by IPsec not supported
- Split horizon can only be disabled on a per-process basis
- Passive interfaces not supported
- No static neighbor definitions

# EIGRP
## Maximum hops
```
metric maximum-hops
```
Default of 100, can be upped to 255
## Distance
```
distance eigrp  
```
Default of 90 and 170
## EIGRP Wide Metrics
**show eigrp plugins** - Requires 8.0.0 eigrp-release
**show ip protocols** - K6, rib-scale of 128 and 64-bit wide metric if supported
## RIB-scale
The **metric rib-scale** command changes factor for downscaling, default 128, can be 1255. EIGRP still chooses best path, only downscaled when placed into rib
## Influencing path selection
Use delay, as bandwidth only other manually influenced component, and it has a knock on effect for other protocols. EIGRP also throttles based upon bandwidth, set it too high and interface could be swamped
## EIGRP packets
**show ip eigrp traffic** shows amount of packets received and what types
## Timers
**ip hello-interval eigrp 1  ** - sets hello per interface
**ip hold-time eigrp 1  **- sets hold per interface
## Neighbour verification
**show ip eigrp neighbours **
- H (Handle) - Shows internal number EIGRP assigns to each neighbour, internally identifies neighbours independent of addressing
- Address and Interface columns - Neighbors IP and routers interface towards neighbour
- Hold - Derived from value advertised by neighbour, decremented each second
- Uptime - Shows neighbour uptime
- SRTT - estimates turnover time between sending reliable packet to neighbour and receiving ack, show in ms
- RTO - Time router waits for ack of a retransmitted unicast packet after previously delivery not acknowledged, show in ms
- Q Cnt - Number of enqueued reliable packets prepared for sending and possibly not sent but for which no ack received, must be zero in stable network. Nonzero normal during router database sync or during network convergence
- Seq number - sequence number of last reliable packet received from neighbour
## All Links
**show ip eigrp topology all-links** - shows topology with all networks, including those who fail feasibility condition check
## Active timer
An active timer exists for a route. Default is 3 minutes, can be set between 1 and 65535 minutes (set with **timers active-time** under router eigrp). I
## Named Mode
- Address Family section - Address family command, specifies AF for which EIGRP instance shall be started. ASN part of this
- Per-AF interface section - Optional, af-interface, locate inside AF. One per-af-interface section created per each routed interface or subinterface. Can also use af-interface default for base settings.
- Per-af-topology section - Relates to MTR (Multi Topology Routing). Always present even if IOS has n support for MTR

```
eigrp router-id
```
Verify with show eigrp protocols and show ip protocols

By default, connected and summary assumed
## Route summarization
Classic mode
**ip summary-address eigrp ***asn address netmask [ distance ] *[ **leak-map ***name *]
Named mode
Under af-interface section
**summary-address ***address netmask *[ **leak-map *** name *]
topology base section
**summary-metric ***address netmask ***distance ***admin-distance.* - Useful for if summary would take over from other routes (as it has AD of 5)
## Passive interface
In classic mode, set either **passive-interface** and the interface, or **passive-interface default **to hit all interfaces. For named mode, **passive-interface** under af-interface section, or **passive-interface **under af-interface default section.
