Question: In an Android environment, a developer is tasked with ensuring the security of cryptographic keys. Which Android security module should the developer rely on to ensure that cryptographic keys are handled securely within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)?
"A": "StrongBox, because it provides file-based encryption allowing different files to be encrypted with different keys.",
"B": "Hardware-backed KeyStore, as it enables apps to perform cryptographic operations in a TEE without exposing the cryptographic key material.",
"C": "GateKeeper, since it is responsible for pattern and password authentication, ensuring secure cryptographic key handling.",
"D": "SELinux, because it uses labels to define access controls and secure cryptographic key operations."
Answer: B
