### Slide 1: Introduction
**Who I am...**
- Corporate Penetration Tester with nearly a decade of experience.
- Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) for business purposes.
- Witnessed and helped turn around some of the worst security practices into better ones.
- As enterprises improved their defenses, we had to find new ways to attack.
- This presentation is a culmination of that knowledge.
- Also involved in Metasploit development, obtaining free MacWorld passes, and promoting OWASP.

---

### Slide 2: Quick Definitions
- **LM (LAN Manager)**: 
  - An outdated and insecure protocol.
  - Disabled by default in Windows Vista and Server 2008.
- **NTLM (NT LAN Manager)**:
  - Replaced LM due to its vulnerabilities.
  - A suite of protocols for authentication and security, known as "NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLMSSP)" or "ntlm 0.12".
  - Describes an authentication protocol and the hash result.
- **Kerberos**:
  - Extended by Microsoft for enhanced security.

---

### Slide 3: Key Terms
- **Nonce**: A number used once to defeat replay attacks.
- **SSPI (Security Support Provider Interface)**: A Microsoft API for various security routines.
- **SPNEGO (Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism)**: Used to negotiate authentication types.
- **IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication)**: The process of negotiating authentication type using SPNEGO.

---

### Slide 4: NTLM Authentication Protocol
- **Type 1**: Client sends a request to initiate communication.
- **Type 2**: Server responds with supported features, including a nonce for encryption.
- **Type 3**: Client sends the username, domain, workstation name, and encrypted LM/NTLM hashes.
- **Server Response**: Compares the received hashes with its internal table and grants or denies access.

---

### Slide 5: LM Hash Generation
1. Password converted to uppercase.
2. Null-padded or truncated to 14 bytes.
3. Split into two 7-byte halves.
4. Two DES keys created from each half.
5. Each key encrypts the string "KGS!@#$%".
6. Concatenate the results to form the LM hash.

---

### Slide 6: NTLMv1 Protocol
1. Cleartext converted to Unicode and hashed with MD4.
2. 16-byte hash null-padded to 21 bytes and split into three 7-byte values.
3. These values create three DES keys.
4. Each key encrypts the nonce, resulting in three 8-byte ciphertext values.
5. Ciphertext values concatenated to form a 24-byte value for the Type 3 response.

---

### Slide 7: NTLMv2 Protocol
1. NTLM hash generated.
2. Uppercase username and domain name concatenated.
3. HMAC-MD5 of the NTLM hash and Step 2 result.
4. Blob created using timestamp, client nonce, and static data.
5. HMAC-MD5 of the blob and Step 3 result.
6. 16-byte value used in the NTLM slot.

---

### Slide 8: NTLMv2 Session
1. 8-byte client nonce generated and padded to 24 bytes.
2. Result placed in the LM field of the Type 3 response.
3. Server's nonce concatenated with the client nonce to form the session nonce.
4. Session nonce MD5'd and truncated to 8 bytes to form the session hash.
5. NTLM hash generated, null-padded to 21 bytes, and split into three 7-byte values.
6. These values create three DES keys.
7. Each key encrypts the nonce, resulting in three 8-byte ciphertext values.
8. Ciphertext values concatenated to form a 24-byte value for the Type 3 response.

---

### Slide 9: Strengths and Weaknesses
- **NTLM is better than LM**:
  - No conversion to uppercase.
  - No breaking passwords into 7-byte blocks.
  - DES used, but nonces protect from pre-computed attacks.
  - Server nonces do not fully protect against pre-computed attacks.
- **Conclusion**: LM and NTLM hashes should be treated as cleartext. Once obtained, an attacker does not need the cleartext password to use them.

---

### Slide 10: NTLM Support
- Supported in:
  - Microsoft products (IIS, IAS, Exchange, Internet Explorer).
  - Samba, Apache, PAM.
  - Other browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Safari).
  - Proxy servers.
  - iPhones for enterprise use.
  - macOS for connecting to Windows shares.
  - WinCE for connecting to Windows shares.
  - Various consumer devices.

---

### Slide 11: Why NTLM is Dead
- **Survivability**: NTLM has persisted due to backwards compatibility and widespread deployment.
- **Incentive to Replace**: For one-off authentication, NTLM is not bad, offering:
  - Replay protection.
  - Mixed case support.
  - Client and server nonces.
  - Message digests.
  - Timestamping.

---

### Slide 12: Single Sign-On (SSO)
- In an enterprise, SSO allows users to access resources with a single login.
- This means cleartext or LM/NTLM ciphertext may be stored in memory throughout the session.
- Authentication can be initiated by applications, not just users.

---

### Slide 13: Attack Scenarios
- **Threat Model**: Assumes an enterprise environment using Windows Domains or Active Directory.
- **Internal Access**: Evildoers typically need physical access, though external threats are possible.

---

### Slide 14: SMB Relay (Original)
- First released in March 2001 at @tlantaCon by Sir Dystic of cDc.
- Listens for NBT requests and collects LM/NTLM hashes.
- **Version 1**: Connects back to the requester using their credentials, emulates an SMB server.
- **Version 2**: Supports NetBIOS names and relays to a third-party host.

---

### Slide 15: SMB Relay (Metasploit)
- Re-engineered as a Metasploit attack module.
- Can connect back to the original host or forward to a single host.
- Works well if users are local administrators or have rights to the destination host.

---

### Slide 16: Stopping SMBRelay
- Change LAN Manager authentication level via Group Policy or Local Security Policy.

---

### Slide 17: NTLMv2 and SMBRelay
- **NTLMv2**: Does not stop this attack. Enable NTLMv2 for now.

---

### Slide 18: Protocol Downgrade
- During SPNEGO, the client and server negotiate supported protocols.
- Using MITM tools like Cain & Abel or Ettercap, an attacker can force a lower-level protocol negotiation.

---

### Slide 19: Protecting Against Downgrade
- Change LAN Manager authentication level via Group Policy or Local Security Policy.

---

### Slide 20: Replay Attacks
- **Forms**:
  - Network capture and replay if no nonce.
  - Obtaining and using LM/NTLM hashes during authentication.
- **Pass The Hash**: Obtain privileges, dump stored hashes, and skip the hash conversion step.

---

### Slide 21: Tools for Replay
- **Obtain Hashes**:
  - FGdump
  - PWDumpX
  - Cain & Able
  - Pass The Hash Toolkit
  - Metasploit, Canvas, CORE Impact
- **Pass The Hash**:
  - Hydra
  - Pass The Hash Toolkit
  - Metasploit, Canvas, CORE Impact

---

### Slide 22: NTLM over Standard Protocols
- NTLM supports HTTP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, NNTP, etc., to enable SSO.
- Part of the Integrated Windows Authentication suite.

---

### Slide 23: IE Trust Zones
- For Integrated Windows Authentication, the browser must be in the "Local Intranet" zone or a customized zone with unique security restrictions.

---

### Slide 24: Zone Actions
- Perform automatic Integrated Windows Authorization.
- Instantiate more ActiveX/COM objects.
- Less restriction on existing ActiveX functions.

---

### Slide 25: Forcing Trust Zones
- Possible to force IE into the Local Intranet zone using Flash or Java applets.
