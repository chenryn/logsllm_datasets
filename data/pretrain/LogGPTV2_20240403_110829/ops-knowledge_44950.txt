User: I've searched for ages on how to use Python 3 under Apache. If there is a walkthrough anywhere, it's very well hidden. Thus, hopefully, one of you Python professionals could make a quick 1-2-3 on how it's done!
I'm on Windows 7 using the newest version of XAMPP.
Assistant: Python 3.0 is only supported via CGI. Put your CGI script in cgi-bin\. If you're willing to look at newer versions, preliminary support is available in mod_wsgi (but you'll probably have to build it yourself).
