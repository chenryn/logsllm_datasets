User: I'm attempting to install MySQL-python on a machine running CentOS 5.5 and python 2.7.  This machine isn't running a mysql server, the mysql instance this box will be using is hosted on a separate server.  I do have a working mysql client.  On attempting sudo pip install MySQL-python, I get an error of EnvironmentError: mysql_config not found, which as far as I can tell is a command that just references /etc/my.cnf, which also isn't present.  Before I go on some wild goose chase creating spurious my.cnf files, is there an easy way to get MySQL-python installed?
Assistant: So it transpires that mysql_config is part of mysql-devel.  mysql-devel is for compiling the mysql client, not the server.  Installing mysql-devel allows the installation of MySQL-python.
