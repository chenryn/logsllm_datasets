User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Why won't iptables allow MySQL connections? For some reason mysql connections from a specific IP address aren't allowed. This is the rule I have (grabbed from iptables-save):

-A INPUT -s 12.34.56.78/32 -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m multiport --dports 22,80,3306 -j ACCEPT


What's interesting here is that SSH connections and HTTP pages load perfectly without issue. I added 3306 for MySQL connections later, but they seem to be ignored. Why?

I'm on CentOS. I have restarted iptables service and have the IPTABLES_SAVE_ON_STOP/RESTART set to yes.

Running netstat -tunelp shows me this:

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:3306                0.0.0.0:*                   LISTEN      27         8849593    10712/mysqld


Here is my full list of rules from iptables -L:

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT     icmp --  anywhere             anywhere
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere
ACCEPT     tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere            state NEW tcp dpt:ssh
ACCEPT     tcp  --  192.168.1.0/24       anywhere            state NEW multiport dports ssh,http,mysql
ACCEPT     tcp  --  some-resolved-hostname-1.com  anywhere            state NEW multiport dports ssh,http,mysql
ACCEPT     tcp  --  some-resolved-hostname-2.com  anywhere            state NEW multiport dports ssh,http,mysql
ACCEPT     tcp  --  some-resolved-hostname-3.com  anywhere            state NEW multiport dports ssh,http,mysql
REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
REJECT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere            reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination


Note: There are no logs (including errors logs) on the server side. The error I get when trying to connect is:

D:\&gt;mysql -u username -p -h 12.34.56.78
Enter password:
ERROR 2003 (HY000): Can't connect to MySQL server on '12.34.56.78' (10060)


Additionally (as this was from a Windows machine trying to connect) I tried this:

D:\&gt;telnet 12.34.56.78 3306
Connecting To 12.34.56.78...Could not open connection to the host, on port 3306: Connect failed


Also note that skip_networking is to to off.

Assistant: First, have you changed my.cnf to configure MySQL to listen for connections on the server's IP address? Your  file should contain this line:

bind-address = &lt;public_ip_address_of_your_machine&gt;

Second, have you given permission to the user connecting from that IP address to connect, in MySQL?

GRANT ALL ON example.* TO someuser@'12.34.56.78' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD';

That would solve the issue if you are getting an error message similar to "Access denied for user: 'someuser@12.34.56.78' (Using password: YES)"

Last, make sure that your router has port-forwarding and firewall rules allowing incoming connections to the MySQL server.
