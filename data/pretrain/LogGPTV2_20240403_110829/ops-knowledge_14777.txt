User: Please explain what is CPU utilization? How to monitor and tune CPU performance?
Assistant: CPU utilization refers to the ratio of the time that the CPU is in the execution state to the total time in a certain period of time. For example, if the CPU is in execution state for 0.5 seconds in 1 second, the CPU utilization is 50%. CPU performance monitoring can be implemented by using some tools in the operating system, such as the task manager and performance monitor in the Windows system, the top and htop commands in the Linux system, and so on. These tools can monitor CPU utilization, process occupancy, memory usage, network connection, etc. in real time. CPU performance tuning can be achieved through the following aspects: 1. Optimize programs: optimize programs that consume high CPU resources to reduce their execution time and CPU usage. 2. Delete useless processes: delete useless processes in the system to reduce CPU usage. 3. Upgrade hardware: Improve the performance of the computer by upgrading the CPU, replacing the memory module and other hardware upgrade operations. 4. Allocation of CPU resources: For systems running multiple programs, CPU resources can be allocated by setting process priorities, so that important programs can get more CPU time. 5. Disable idle devices: Disable unnecessary devices, services, etc. in the system to reduce CPU usage.
