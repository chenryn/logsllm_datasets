User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What risks am I taking by using an http site to play a video game that just records mouse events? There's this game at http://slither.io which I like to play. Only inputs that I give to it are space bar, and cursor location.
It's not https. Are there any risks?

Assistant: Yes, there is a risk.
HTTPS ensures not just confidentiality, but also integrity and authenticity. As such, an attacker could hijack the connection between you and the server and inject malicious JavaScript into your session.
How likely is that to happen?
Depends on how you connect to the server. If you are in your own home, then the likelihood is not very big. It's a risk still, don't get me wrong, but I don't want to cause unnecessary paranoia.
On the other hand, if you connect to a public access point (e.g. &quot;free McDonald's Wifi&quot;), then the chance of this happening is much much higher.
How severe is this?
Since there is no sensitive data there, the &quot;usual&quot; things like credential stealing or session hijacking are not applicable. However, depending on how determined the attacker is, they might redirect you to other malicious domains, exploit browser vulnerabilities, get you to download stuff or even get you to disclose credentials for other services (e.g. &quot;Log in with your Google, Twitter or Facebook account to play&quot;).
As Eilon has pointed out in the comments, another potentially unwanted side-effect is that your ISP can tamper with the website you use. Some ISPs do this for arguably benign purposes, such as stripping whitespace off the HTML document before sending it to you, while others do more &quot;intrusive&quot; changes, such as compressing images, or even injecting advertisements into the website. While this is not a security-risk per se, it is unwanted behavior that can most effectively be combatted by using HTTPS.
Does that mean you should stop playing?
That depends completely on your risk appetite and whether or not the upsides outweigh the downsides for you personally.
