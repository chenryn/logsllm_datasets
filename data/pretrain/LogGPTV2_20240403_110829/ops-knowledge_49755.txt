User: I am using nose in jenkins to test a project. If a test fails, I get a short report of the output to the console. I would like to have this output regardless of the test result. So even if the test passes I want to be able to see the tests output to stderr/stdout.
At the moment I can turn off logging by calling nose with --nocapture. However this results in all the output beeing under the projects console log that jenkins creates by default. How I tell nose/capture to append the captured output to each test result shown in Jenkins?
I use xunit to generate a junit compatible xml file which is in turn used by Jenkins to generate its reports.
edit: Additional Infos as requested
Url in Jenkins (after buildnumber part):
/testReport/testDesignParser.testDesignCsvParser.testDesignCsvParser/testDesignCsvParser/test/?
I know that this design is not pretty but thats how it is now. If it matters: 

`testDesignParser.testDesignCsvParser.testDesignCsvParser` module  
`testDesignCsvParser`                                      class  
`test`                                                     (member)testfunction
Assistant: With the latest Jenkins there is an option to save the output (Retain long standard output/error) right under the post build step belonging to JUnit. Additionally I run nose with --nocapture. This gives me a console output view on every test (an option on the left menu when I have a test opened)
