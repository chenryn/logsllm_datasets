I tried using the `@types/styled-components` package and had problems.
How to correctly define a reference for styled-components?
I wrote the following test code:
    import React, {Component, RefObject, ReactNode} from 'react';
    import styled, {StyledComponentClass} from 'styled-components';
    type TModalShadowContainer = StyledComponentClass;
    const ModalShadowContainer: TModalShadowContainer = styled.div` 
    	background-color: black;
    `;
    export default class Modal extends Component {
    	private readonly modalRef: RefObject;
    	constructor(props: {}) {
    		super(props);
    		this.modalRef = React.createRef();
    	}
    	public render(): ReactNode {
    		return (
    				{this.props.children}
    		);
    	}
    }
The error appears on the line:
Error text:
    Type 'RefObject>' is not assignable to type 'string | ((instance: Component | StatelessComponent | undefined; theme?: {} | undefined; }, any, any> | null) => any) | RefObject> | undefined'.
      Type 'RefObject>' is not assignable to type 'RefObject | StatelessComponent | undefined; theme?: {} | undefined; }, any, any>>'.
        Type 'StyledComponentClass' is not assignable to type 'Component | StatelessComponent | undefined; theme?: {} | undefined; }, any, any>'.
          Property 'setState' is missing in type 'StyledComponentClass'.
How to describe (define) a ref in TypeScript lang?
Since everyone is trying to convince me not to do it, I have to refer to the
original sources, namely:
https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced#refs  
https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#creating-refs
