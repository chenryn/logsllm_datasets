## Abstract

The ability of attackers to rapidly gain control of vast numbers of Internet hosts poses a significant threat to the overall security of the Internet. Once subverted, these hosts can be used to launch massive denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, steal or corrupt sensitive information, and disrupt network use in subtle ways. This paper presents an analysis of the magnitude of this threat, starting with a mathematical model derived from empirical data on the spread of Code Red I in July 2001. We discuss techniques employed by subsequent worms, such as Code Red II and Nimda, and develop and evaluate several new, highly virulent techniques: hit-list scanning, permutation scanning, and the use of Internet-sized hit-lists. We also examine the threat of surreptitious worms that spread slowly but are difficult to detect, and consider robust mechanisms for controlling and updating deployed worms. Finally, we argue for the need to establish a "Center for Disease Control" analog for cybersecurity threats and outline some of its potential components.

## 1. Introduction

Controlling a large number of Internet hosts can lead to significant damage. Attackers can launch distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, access and corrupt sensitive information, and sow confusion and disruption. Unfortunately, it is feasible for an attacker to gain control of millions of Internet hosts through the exploitation of worms—programs that self-propagate by exploiting security flaws in widely-used services. This paper analyzes the magnitude of this threat, discusses techniques for achieving greater virulence, and proposes a strategy for addressing the issue.

## 2. An Analysis of Code Red I

### 2.1 Initial Spread and Behavior

The first version of the Code Red worm, CRv1, was discovered on July 13, 2001, by Ryan Permeh and Marc Maiffret of eEye Digital Security. It spread by compromising Microsoft IIS web servers using the .ida vulnerability (CVE-2001-0500). However, CRv1 had a bug in its random number generator, which limited its spread. On July 19, 2001, a second version, CRv2 (Code Red I), began to spread, fixing the random number generation bug and adding a DDoS payload targeting www.whitehouse.gov.

### 2.2 Mathematical Model

We developed a quantitative theory to explain the spread of Code Red I. Our Random Constant Spread (RCS) model assumes that the worm has a good random number generator and that the initial compromise rate \( K \) is a global constant. The model is defined by the following variables:

- \( N \): Total number of vulnerable servers.
- \( K \): Initial compromise rate.
- \( T \): Time when the incident occurs.
- \( a \): Proportion of vulnerable machines compromised.
- \( t \): Time (in hours).

The equation for the number of newly compromised machines \( N \, da \) in a small time interval \( dt \) is:

\[ N \, da = (N \, a) \, K \, (1 - a) \, dt \]

This model suggests that a worm like Code Red I can compromise all vulnerable machines on the Internet relatively quickly.

### 2.3 Empirical Data and Validation

Figure 3 shows hourly probe rate data from Ken Eichmann of the Chemical Abstracts Service, along with a fit to the data using \( K = 1.8 \) and \( T = 11.9 \). The model provides a reasonable first approximation of the worm's behavior. The infection rate was about 1.8 per hour, indicating that each infected server could find about 1.8 other servers per hour in the early stages of the infection.

Although Code Red I turned itself off at midnight UTC on July 19, hosts with inaccurate clocks kept it alive, allowing it to spread again on August 1. Figure 4 shows similar data and fit for this incident, with a lower spread rate of about 0.7, suggesting that the number of vulnerable systems had decreased by about 40% in the 11 days between the two incidents.

## 3. Techniques for Greater Virulence

### 3.1 Hit-List Scanning

Hit-list scanning accelerates the initial spread of a worm by targeting a pre-defined list of high-value targets. This technique can create a "Warhol worm," capable of infecting most or all vulnerable targets in a few minutes to an hour.

### 3.2 Permutation Scanning

Permutation scanning enables distributed coordination of a worm by generating a unique sequence of IP addresses for each infected host. This method allows the worm to cover the address space more efficiently and avoid redundant scans.

### 3.3 Internet-Sized Hit-Lists

Using an Internet-sized hit-list, a worm can infect the entire vulnerable population in tens of seconds, creating a "flash worm." This speed makes human-mediated counter-responses impossible.

## 4. Threat of Surreptitious Worms

Surreptitious worms spread slowly but in a hard-to-detect manner, masquerading as normal traffic. These worms can subvert up to 10 million Internet hosts. We demonstrate the potential for such worms and discuss mechanisms for their control and update, including cryptographically-secured updates.

## 5. Establishing a Cybersecurity "Center for Disease Control"

Given the serious nature of the threat, we propose the establishment of a "Center for Disease Control" for cybersecurity. This center would serve multiple roles, including monitoring, response, and education. We discuss the resources and structure required for such a center to be effective.

## 6. Conclusion

The ability to control a large number of Internet hosts poses a significant threat to national and international cybersecurity. By understanding and addressing the techniques used by highly virulent worms, and by establishing a dedicated center for cybersecurity, we can better protect against these threats.
