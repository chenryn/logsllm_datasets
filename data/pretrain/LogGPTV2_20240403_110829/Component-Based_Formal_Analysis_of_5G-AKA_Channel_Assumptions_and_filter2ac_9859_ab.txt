5G-AKA is a natural evolution from previous generation AKA
protocols, and as such we ﬁnd similarities between components.
Of note for this research, the pair of 5G components AUSF
& ARPF appear to have similar functionality to the pair of
2G/3G/4G components HLR & AuC (denoting respectively the
‘Home Location Register’ and ‘Authentication Centre’).
In the 2G-, 3G-, and 4G-AKA protocols, the speciﬁcations
consider the AuC and HLR as a single component, referred
to as the “HSS” or Home Subscriber Server. For example,
the 4G-AKA speciﬁcation in TS 33.401 [7] does not even
mention the HLR (cf. AUSF). Previous research therefore only
models three components instead of four, with good reason: in
2G/3G/4G, the AuC does not participate in the AKA protocol
directly. The AuC generates various keys on demand but is not
a named party in the protocol’s message sequence ﬂow.
In 5G both the AUSF and ARPF have separate, formally
encoded roles to play in the protocol speciﬁcation, as explicitly
speciﬁed in the 5G-AKA speciﬁcation in TS 33.501 [5]. We
therefore consider and model them as distinct components.
III. THREAT MODEL
The 5G-AKA documentation does not specify an explicit
threat model. Section 5 of TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5], “Security
requirements and features” gives a mixture of threat models
and desired security properties from the perspectives of the
involved components, and we attempt to extract the most
important points relating to the threat model here. We refer
to this threat model as AStandard. We return to the required
security properties in Section IV. For transparency, we quote
the original documentation where possible.
A. Channel threat model
5G-AKA uses three network channels, as in Figure 1:
1) UE ↔ SEAF
2) SEAF ↔ AUSF
3) AUSF ↔ ARPF
The communications between SEAF, AUSF, and ARPF are
within the “5G Core Network” and are speciﬁed to use “e2e
core network interconnection” channels. In Figure 3 we quote
the requirements of these channels from TS 33.501, which
suggest that SEAF ↔ AUSF and AUSF ↔ ARPF form a type
of secure channel. The required properties do not explicitly
require or guarantee delivery of messages, nor of ordering of the
receipt of messages. We believe these properties are analogous
(or very close) to setting up and maintaining long-term IPSec,
(D)TLS, or Diameter sessions over these channels, between the
named parties. We return to the subtleties regarding the precise
assumptions and formal modelling later in Section VII-B.
The standard does not specify any assumed security for the
channel between UE and SEAF, as the signal is over the air. In
some sense, providing security here is part of what 5G-AKA
aims to provide. We assume the channel between the UE and
SEAF is insecure, and model it using a classical Dolev-Yao
network adversary model.

5.7.4: Requirements for e2e core network interconnection security
A solution for e2e core network interconnection security shall satisfy the
following requirements.
• The solution shall provide conﬁdentiality and/or integrity end-to-end
between source and destination network for speciﬁc message elements
identiﬁed in this speciﬁcation. [...]
• The destination network shall be able to determine the authenticity of
the source network that sent the speciﬁc message elements protected
[...]
• The solution should be using standard security protocols.
• The solution shall cover prevention of replay attacks.

B. Component threat model
TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] does not describe whether it considers
compromise of components within the system as part of its
threat model. We assume that compromise of any core network
component (SEAF, AUSF, or ARPF) is not allowed in the basic
threat model, AStandard. The standard describes (Figure 4) the
protections required for the long-term key K within the USIM,
so we assume an adversary cannot compromise an honest user’s
key K. We do however assume that a persistent and capable
adversary would be able to compromise the long-term key(s) of
other USIMs, e.g., ones in its long-term possession. Separate
from our main analysis we consider a stronger threat model,
where compromise of components and secure channels are
allowed in Section X: AStronger.
IV. REQUIRED SECURITY PROPERTIES
TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] details security requirements on the
elements of the 5G ecosystem. We now detail the requirements
directly affecting 5G-AKA, and the security properties the
standard states or implies 5G should uphold. TS 33.501
contains the text describing “security requirements”, considering
conﬁdentiality and integrity requirements; we cite this in Fig-
ure 6. Section 5 describes these requirements on Authentication
and Authorization; we include this in Figure 7.
A. Secrecy
TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] does not explicitly state a requirement
for the secrecy of the session key KSEAF (the “anchor key”);
possession of this key grants the bearer access to a network
on behalf of the UE which derived the key; Figure 5 alludes
strongly to the importance of the KSEAF, and its cryptographic
parent, the KAUSF. We consider session key secrecy to be one

5.1.4 Secure storage and processing of subscription credentials
The following requirements apply for the storage and processing of the
subscription credentials used to access the 5G network:
• The subscription credential(s) shall be integrity protected within the
• The long-term key(s) of the subscription credential(s) (e.g., K in EPS
AKA) shall be conﬁdentiality protected within the NG-UE using a
tamper resistant secure hardware component.
• The long-term key(s) of the subscription credential(s) shall never be
available in the clear outside of the tamper resistant secure hardware
component. [. . . ]

6.1 Primary authentication and key agreement
The purpose of the primary authentication and key agreement procedures
is to enable mutual authentication between the UE and the network and
provide keying material that can be used between the UE and network
in subsequent security procedures. The keying material generated by the
primary authentication and key agreement procedure results in an anchor
key called the KSEAF provided by the AUSF of the home network to the
SEAF of the serving network.
Keys for more than one security context can be derived from the KSEAF
without the need of a new authentication run. A concrete example of this
is that an authentication run over a 3GPP access network can also provide
keys to establish security between the UE and a N3IWF used in untrusted
non-3GPP access.
The authentication run also results in an intermediate key called the KAUSF.
The KAUSF may be left at the AUSF based on the home operator’s policy
on using such key.

of the primary goals of 5G-AKA, goal, even if unstated in
the speciﬁcation. We therefore interpret the requirements from
Figure 4 as the following key secrecy properties:
S1. The adversary must not be able to learn the long-term
secret key K of an honest subscriber (stored within the
UE/USIM).
S2. The adversary must not be able to learn an “anchor key”
KSEAF for an honest subscriber derived by 5G-AKA, or
its cryptographic parent, KAUSF.
B. Authentication and agreement
5.10 Authentication and Authorization
The 5G system shall satisfy the following requirements.
Subscription authentication: The serving network shall authenticate the
Subscription Permanent Identiﬁer (SUPI) in the process of authentication
and key agreement between UE and network. [...]
Serving network authentication: The UE shall authenticate the serving
network identiﬁer through implicit key authentication. The meaning of
‘implicit key authentication’ here is that authentication is provided through
the successful use of keys resulting from authentication and key agreement
in subsequent procedures. [...]
UE authorization: The serving network shall authorize the UE through the
subscription proﬁle obtained from the home network. UE authorization is
based on the authenticated SUPI. [...]
Serving network authorization:
Serving network authorization by the home network: Assurance shall be
provided to the UE that it is connected to a serving network that is authorized
by the home network to provide services to the UE. This authorization is
‘implicit’ in the sense that it is implied by a successful authentication and
key agreement run. [...]
Access network authorization: Assurance shall be provided to the UE that
it is connected to an access network that is authorized by the serving network
to provide services to the UE. This authorization is ‘implicit’ in the sense
that it is implied by a successful establishment of access network security.
This access network authorization applies to all types of access networks.
Fig. 7. Authentication and Authorization properties required by TS 33.501
(from [5] p. 23).
We interpret the requirements from TS 33.501, notably
Figure 7, as the following agreement properties:
A1. The serving network and UE must agree on the identity
A2. The UE and serving network must agree on the identity
of the UE.
of the serving network.
A3. The home network and serving network must agree on
the identity of the UE (and upon agreement, the home
network conﬁrms that the UE is a legitimate subscriber).
A4. The UE and home network must agree on the identity of
the home network.
A5. The UE and home network must agree on the identity of
the serving network (and this agreement implies that the
serving network is authorised by the home network).
A6. The UE, serving network, and home network must agree
on the anchor key, KSEAF.
A7. The anchor key KSEAF must not be replayable, i.e., the
UE, home network, and serving network agree that the
KSEAF has only ever been accepted by one session.1
We describe how we interpret, model, and analyse these
informally deﬁned security requirements as more formal secrecy
and authentication properties in Sections VI-A and VI-B.
1Replay protection for all data is required and indicated at multiple points,
so we believe this is a reasonable goal for KSEAF as well.

V. FORMAL MODEL OF 5G-AKA IN TAMARIN
We formally model the four-party 5G-AKA protocol v0.7.0
[5] in the TAMARIN Prover.2 The explicit speciﬁcation of
four parties within 5G-AKA is a change from UMTS-AKA
(3G) and LTE-AKA (4G), which describe three major network
components, rather than four. As we will see later, this opens
up new attack possibilities that are not covered if one models
AUSF and ARPF as a single entity, as done in [11].
Our modelling and analysis of 5G-AKA takes advantage
of the TAMARIN security protocol veriﬁcation tool [21]. We
give an overview of the modelling assumptions we made (in
the context of 5G), and example 5G-AKA rules in its syntax.
A. Symbolic modelling
We use symbolic analysis, which means that instead of
concrete bitstrings, we consider abstract terms. For example,
the hash of a term x is represented as the term h(x). The
adversary can symbolically manipulate terms, e.g., decrypting
terms for which it knows the key. This corresponds to the black-
box model of cryptography often called perfect cryptography.
Depending on the threat model the adversary can eavesdrop,
insert, or block messages on channels, or may learn secret
information of any component or party it can compromise.
B. Modelling choices
Counters, ‘SQN’: The 5G-AKA protocol makes use of a
counter or sequence number, SQN. TS 33.501 [5] refers to TS
33.102 [4, §6.3.2] for the deﬁnition and behaviour of this term.
The standard explicitly acknowledges that counters wrapping
around could lead to repetition of a CK/IK3 key-pair, and gives
a method for protecting against this (“informative Annex C.2”
of [4]). We model counters as strictly monotonically increasing,
with no possibility of wrapping around.
We do not consider deltas, or allowed increases between
maximum previously seen counter values; we permit all SQN
values which are strictly greater than the current maximum
value. In this way, we are slightly more permissive than many
implementations of the standard may be; we do not believe
this affects our results. UEs and network operators are not
required to implement the given counter-measure; we discuss
the implications (or lack thereof) counters have overall on our
discovered attacks and further analysis in Section VIII-A.
C. Separation of components
5G-AKA is an evolution of the EPS-AKA protocol from
LTE/4G [7]; changes include the inclusion of concealed
identities or SUCIs, and the addition of the 5G-AC and
5G-ACA messages. Another important difference is the number
components formally described by the protocol standard. In
LTE/4G, the ‘Authentication and key agreement’ protocol
2These models have built upon and signiﬁcantly diverged from initial models
of 5G-AKA v0.3.0 in the three-party setting, eventually leading to independent
concurrent work: [11].
3CK and IK are the (symmetric) Conﬁdentiality and Integrity Keys
respectively, both generated from KSEAF, by both the UE and SEAF. A repeated
SQN would not lead to repeated CK/IK values directly as they are derived solely
from K and RAND, but if a protocol run can be replayed with a previously
seen RAND value (and the ARPF and UE will accept it), then the resultant
CK/IK will be the same.
section of TS 33.401 [7, §6.1.1] describes just three components:
the UE,4 and the “HSS”, or Home Subscriber Server. In 5G
we have four components involved in the 5G-AKA protocol,
i.e., the UE, SEAF, AUSF, and ARPF. The SEAF and MME
are broadly analogous in functionality; the HSS’s functionality
is split between the AUSF and ARPF.
Other research modelling 5G-AKA only considers three
major components; it is therefore worth discussing in more
detail some of the reasons behind our choice to model four
components. Because channels between AUSFs and ARPFs are
completely internal to a telecommunications company’s network
and work over different mediums, we cannot assume that they
will be implemented similarly. As further context, we have
conﬁrmation from a large telecommunications provider that
there are major differences between internal network security,
controls, regulation, and network implementation compared to
