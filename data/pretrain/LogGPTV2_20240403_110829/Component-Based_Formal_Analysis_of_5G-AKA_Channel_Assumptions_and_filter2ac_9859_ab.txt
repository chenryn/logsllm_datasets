5G-AKA is a natural evolution from previous generation AKA protocols, and as such, there are similarities between the components. Notably, in 5G, the pair of components AUSF (Authentication Server Function) and ARPF (Authentication Credential Repository and Processing Function) appear to have similar functionalities to the 2G/3G/4G components HLR (Home Location Register) and AuC (Authentication Centre).

In 2G, 3G, and 4G AKA protocols, the specifications treat the AuC and HLR as a single component, often referred to as the "HSS" or Home Subscriber Server. For example, the 4G-AKA specification in TS 33.401 [7] does not even mention the HLR. Consequently, previous research models only three components instead of four, with good reason: in 2G/3G/4G, the AuC does not directly participate in the AKA protocol. The AuC generates various keys on demand but is not a named party in the protocol's message sequence flow.

In 5G, both the AUSF and ARPF have distinct, formally defined roles in the protocol specification, as explicitly stated in the 5G-AKA specification in TS 33.501 [5]. Therefore, we consider and model them as separate components.

### III. Threat Model

The 5G-AKA documentation does not specify an explicit threat model. Section 5 of TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5], titled "Security requirements and features," provides a mixture of threat models and desired security properties from the perspectives of the involved components. We attempt to extract the most important points related to the threat model here. We refer to this threat model as AStandard. We will return to the required security properties in Section IV. For transparency, we quote the original documentation where possible.

#### A. Channel Threat Model

5G-AKA uses three network channels, as shown in Figure 1:
1. UE ↔ SEAF
2. SEAF ↔ AUSF
3. AUSF ↔ ARPF

The communications between SEAF, AUSF, and ARPF occur within the "5G Core Network" and are specified to use "e2e core network interconnection" channels. In Figure 3, we quote the requirements for these channels from TS 33.501, which suggest that SEAF ↔ AUSF and AUSF ↔ ARPF form a type of secure channel. The required properties do not explicitly require or guarantee delivery of messages or the ordering of message receipt. We believe these properties are analogous to setting up and maintaining long-term IPSec, (D)TLS, or Diameter sessions over these channels, between the named parties. We will discuss the subtleties regarding the precise assumptions and formal modeling later in Section VII-B.

The standard does not specify any assumed security for the channel between UE and SEAF, as the signal is over the air. Providing security here is part of what 5G-AKA aims to provide. We assume the channel between the UE and SEAF is insecure and model it using a classical Dolev-Yao network adversary model.

**Figure 2.** The normal flow of the 5G-AKA Protocol. Only the UE and ARPF know the user’s long-term key, K. Dashed lines indicate secure channels.

**Figure 3.** Requirements for e2e core network security (from [5] p. 21)

#### B. Component Threat Model

TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] does not describe whether it considers the compromise of components within the system as part of its threat model. We assume that the compromise of any core network component (SEAF, AUSF, or ARPF) is not allowed in the basic threat model, AStandard. The standard describes the protections required for the long-term key K within the USIM, so we assume an adversary cannot compromise an honest user’s key K. However, we assume that a persistent and capable adversary could compromise the long-term keys of other USIMs, e.g., those in its long-term possession. In a separate analysis, we consider a stronger threat model, AStronger, where the compromise of components and secure channels is allowed.

### IV. Required Security Properties

TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] details security requirements for the elements of the 5G ecosystem. We now detail the requirements directly affecting 5G-AKA and the security properties the standard states or implies 5G should uphold. TS 33.501 contains the text describing "security requirements," considering confidentiality and integrity requirements; we cite this in Figure 6. Section 5 describes these requirements on Authentication and Authorization; we include this in Figure 7.

#### A. Secrecy

TS 33.501 v0.7.0 [5] does not explicitly state a requirement for the secrecy of the session key KSEAF (the "anchor key"). Possession of this key grants the bearer access to a network on behalf of the UE that derived the key. Figure 5 alludes strongly to the importance of the KSEAF and its cryptographic parent, the KAUSF. We consider session key secrecy to be one of the primary goals of 5G-AKA, even if unstated in the specification. We interpret the requirements from Figure 4 as the following key secrecy properties:

- **S1.** The adversary must not be able to learn the long-term secret key K of an honest subscriber (stored within the UE/USIM).
- **S2.** The adversary must not be able to learn an "anchor key" KSEAF for an honest subscriber derived by 5G-AKA, or its cryptographic parent, KAUSF.

**Figure 5.** Primary authentication and key agreement (from [5] p. 25)

**Figure 6.** Security requirements and features (from [5] p. 15)

#### B. Authentication and Agreement

We interpret the requirements from TS 33.501, notably Figure 7, as the following agreement properties:

- **A1.** The serving network and UE must agree on the identity of the UE.
- **A2.** The UE and serving network must agree on the identity of the serving network.
- **A3.** The home network and serving network must agree on the identity of the UE (and upon agreement, the home network confirms that the UE is a legitimate subscriber).
- **A4.** The UE and home network must agree on the identity of the home network.
- **A5.** The UE and home network must agree on the identity of the serving network (and this agreement implies that the serving network is authorized by the home network).
- **A6.** The UE, serving network, and home network must agree on the anchor key, KSEAF.
- **A7.** The anchor key KSEAF must not be replayable, i.e., the UE, home network, and serving network agree that the KSEAF has only ever been accepted by one session.

**Figure 7.** Authentication and Authorization properties required by TS 33.501 (from [5] p. 23)

We describe how we interpret, model, and analyze these informally defined security requirements as more formal secrecy and authentication properties in Sections VI-A and VI-B.

### V. Formal Model of 5G-AKA in Tamarin

We formally model the four-party 5G-AKA protocol v0.7.0 [5] in the Tamarin Prover. The explicit specification of four parties within 5G-AKA is a change from UMTS-AKA (3G) and LTE-AKA (4G), which describe three major network components. This opens up new attack possibilities that are not covered if one models AUSF and ARPF as a single entity, as done in [11].

Our modeling and analysis of 5G-AKA take advantage of the Tamarin security protocol verification tool [21]. We provide an overview of the modeling assumptions we made (in the context of 5G) and example 5G-AKA rules in its syntax.

#### A. Symbolic Modeling

We use symbolic analysis, which means that instead of concrete bitstrings, we consider abstract terms. For example, the hash of a term x is represented as the term h(x). The adversary can symbolically manipulate terms, e.g., decrypting terms for which it knows the key. This corresponds to the black-box model of cryptography often called perfect cryptography. Depending on the threat model, the adversary can eavesdrop, insert, or block messages on channels, or may learn secret information of any component or party it can compromise.

#### B. Modeling Choices

- **Counters, 'SQN':** The 5G-AKA protocol uses a counter or sequence number, SQN. TS 33.501 [5] refers to TS 33.102 [4, §6.3.2] for the definition and behavior of this term. The standard explicitly acknowledges that counters wrapping around could lead to repetition of a CK/IK key-pair and gives a method for protecting against this ("informative Annex C.2" of [4]). We model counters as strictly monotonically increasing, with no possibility of wrapping around. We do not consider deltas or allowed increases between maximum previously seen counter values; we permit all SQN values that are strictly greater than the current maximum value. In this way, we are slightly more permissive than many implementations of the standard may be; we do not believe this affects our results. UEs and network operators are not required to implement the given counter-measure; we discuss the implications (or lack thereof) counters have overall on our discovered attacks and further analysis in Section VIII-A.

#### C. Separation of Components

5G-AKA is an evolution of the EPS-AKA protocol from LTE/4G [7]; changes include the inclusion of concealed identities or SUCIs and the addition of the 5G-AC and 5G-ACA messages. Another important difference is the number of components formally described by the protocol standard. In LTE/4G, the "Authentication and key agreement" protocol section of TS 33.401 [7, §6.1.1] describes just three components: the UE and the "HSS," or Home Subscriber Server. In 5G, we have four components involved in the 5G-AKA protocol: the UE, SEAF, AUSF, and ARPF. The SEAF and MME are broadly analogous in functionality; the HSS's functionality is split between the AUSF and ARPF.

Other research modeling 5G-AKA only considers three major components. It is therefore worth discussing in more detail some of the reasons behind our choice to model four components. Because channels between AUSFs and ARPFs are completely internal to a telecommunications company’s network and work over different mediums, we cannot assume that they will be implemented similarly. As further context, we have confirmation from a large telecommunications provider that there are significant differences between internal network security, controls, regulation, and network implementation compared to external channels.
