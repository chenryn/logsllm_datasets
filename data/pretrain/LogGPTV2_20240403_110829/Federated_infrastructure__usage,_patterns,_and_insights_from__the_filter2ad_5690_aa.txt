**Abstract:**
This paper presents the first comprehensive measurement study of the Helium network, a decentralized low-power, wide-area network (LPWAN) designed to provide wireless coverage for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Unlike traditional infrastructure, Helium's "hotspots" (base stations) are owned and operated by individuals who are compensated by the network for providing coverage and data transmission services.

As of May 2021, Helium has over 40,000 active hotspots, with approximately 1,000 new hotspots coming online daily. This deployment is highly decentralized, with 84% of users owning no more than three hotspots. However, some support infrastructure remains centralized, with over 99% of data traffic routed through a single cloud endpoint, and in multiple cities, all hotspots rely on a single Internet Service Provider (ISP) for backhaul.

Currently, Helium is largely speculative, with more hotspot activity than user activity. The crowdsourced, incentive-driven infrastructure deployment model shows both successes and challenges, including gamification and apathy. Given the lack of clear, radio-oriented coverage maps, we developed and tested coverage models based on network incentives. Our empirical testing with IoT devices found basic functionality but also revealed numerous reliability issues.

**1. Introduction**

The success of smart cities depends significantly on their supporting infrastructure. While edge devices are ready, there is a need for a widely-deployed communication infrastructure tailored to their requirements. Embedded systems are integrated into urban environments, and the scale of the network will come from billions of devices sending small amounts of data. As more wireless devices are packed into the same space, more supporting infrastructure is required. Mark Weiser [23] predicted and quantified the need for small cells for IoT devices, which was recently refined by Ghena et al. [6]. This means deploying infrastructure capable of supporting IoT devices across wide geographic areas with density proportional to the number of deployed nodes.

On the surface, this problem seems similar to traditional cellular systems. However, the Helium network offers a new approach. Instead of relying on a few large entities to deploy millions of base stations, Helium invites millions of individuals to deploy one or two base stations each.

Helium released its first product, a LoRa gateway called the Helium Hotspot, in the fall of 2019. Today, Helium does not manufacture any hardware; instead, five (and growing) third-party companies produce Helium-compliant products. Over 1,000 Helium hotspots come online every day, purchased by individual investors, distributing the capital and risk.

To manage this decentralized network, Helium built a custom blockchain, enabling a micro-transaction model. Each packet for an IoT device costs just $0.00001 USD, paid directly to the infrastructure owner. The development of a new cryptocurrency, and its initial ability to mint coins, further enables Helium to pay infrastructure operators without immediately raising fiat currency. If successful, the value of the new currency will rise, allowing hotspot owners to recoup their investment and turn a profit.

Now is an interesting time to study the Helium network. It is large enough to observe trends but still early enough to make changes. The infrastructure is experiencing exponential growth, but with associated challenges. There is very little data traffic, though it is steadily increasing. This new model for deploying and managing wireless infrastructure is now seeing real adoption, and our aim is to study its effectiveness.

**Research Questions:**
- What does a decentralized network topology look like, and how does it change over time?
- Who is using the Helium network, and how much do they use it?
- How does this decentralized network sustain itself?
- How well does the network perform, and how reliable is it?

We begin by analyzing transactions on the blockchain to understand the new model of distributed wireless infrastructure. In Section 4, we focus on hotspots, investigating the physical deployment, the people and organizations involved, and the evolution of the infrastructure over time. In Section 5, despite the small user base, we explore current usage and potential future insights as adoption grows.

One of Helium's major selling points is its "decentralized wireless network." Helium relies on existing wireline providers for hotspot backhaul, potentially competing with them. Hotspots are deployed by non-experts, which may place them behind NATs, firewalls, or other uncontrolled middleboxes. In Section 6, we investigate how the connectivity of uncontrolled, crowdsourced infrastructure affects the robustness and performance of Helium.

While hotspot deployment is uncontrolled, it is not without direction. Helium employs a governance-by-incentive model, rewarding those who deploy honestly and in the best interest of the network. In Section 7, we examine the effectiveness of these incentive-based rules and provide insights for future refinement.

Finally, in Section 8, we empirically evaluate Helium's performance as a wireless network. We investigate expected coverage and performance, using incentive-derived models. While Helium is adequate for best-effort service, the current infrastructure is not yet reliable, delivering only around 70% of packets in controlled, best-case scenarios and providing unpredictable geospatial coverage, even in areas with dense hotspot deployments.

**2. Helium – Quick Overview**

Helium is a new wireless provider focusing on building crowdsourced hotspot infrastructure for wide-area LoRa coverage. LoRa is one of several new radio technologies for low-power, low-bandwidth edge devices (IoT-class devices). Unlike traditional wireless infrastructure, Helium does not own the deployed LoRa base stations. Individuals purchase, deploy, and maintain Helium hotspots in exchange for payment for coverage and data transmission. Helium initially built and sold the hotspots, maintains firmware for third-party mass-produced hotspots, develops supporting cloud infrastructure, and manages the blockchain underpinning the network.

We focus on Helium’s LoRa network, though Helium has announced an expansion to 5G [7]. In Section 9.2, we consider how this study reflects on the future of Helium more broadly.

**2.1 Helium from a Basic User’s Perspective**

To deploy a LoRa device using the Helium network, a user first registers a new application with the Helium Console, a cloud service acting as a LoRaWAN router and Helium wallet. Users can deploy their own equivalent, but most rely on the Helium Console. Next, users deposit money in their Console account to pay for future data. They then register a new device with the Console, which provides configuration parameters for the device's networking stack. After this, the device is ready to deploy, capable of sending and receiving packets from the Helium network. In the field, packets sent by devices are received by hotspots, forwarded to the Console, which pays hotspots and provides packet payloads to application users via HTTP or other means.

**2.2 Components of the Helium Network**

The Helium network is built on top of the LoRaWAN network architecture, a cloud-based protocol that routes LoRa packets between wireless devices and cloud services. The primary difference is that Helium uses crowdsourced hotspots to bridge cloud services with the LoRa wireless network, while LoRaWAN requires application owners to deploy and operate their own hotspots. Helium adds routing by overloading identifiers in LoRaMAC that normally identify the device and its owning application.

**Components:**
- **Routers:** Cloud servers managing the LoRaWAN protocol across devices and applications, responsible for authenticating devices and receiving messages. Hotspots find Helium-compliant routers using packet metadata and a filter list in the Helium blockchain.
- **Edge Devices:** LoRa-enabled end wireless devices, pre-provisioned with Device End User Identifier (EUI), Application EUI, and App key for authentication.
- **Packet Forwarders:** LoRa wireless modules in hotspots, relaying edge device radio packets to and from the co-resident miner.
- **Miners:** Transmit encapsulated LoRa packet payloads to and from Helium routers and maintain the Helium blockchain. Miners receive Helium tokens (HNT) as rewards for data transit, network coverage validation, and blockchain consensus activities.
- **Hotspots:** Physical boxes containing a packet forwarder and a miner, making up the majority of deployed Helium infrastructure.
- **Helium Console:** A cloud service provided by Helium, acting as a Helium router. Users can opt to use the Console instead of running their own router.
- **Validators:** A new class of Helium node, currently in testing, that will take over blockchain maintenance events from miners.

In summary, the Helium network leverages a decentralized, incentive-driven model to provide wide-area LoRa coverage for IoT devices, with a focus on scalability, robustness, and performance.
