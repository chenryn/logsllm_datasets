ABSTRACT
In this paper, we provide the first broad measurement study of
the operation, adoption, performance, and efficacy of Helium. The
Helium network aims to provide low-power, wide-area network
wireless coverage for Internet of Things-class devices. In contrast to
traditional infrastructure, “hotspots” (base stations) are owned and
operated by individuals who are paid by the network for providing
coverage and are paid directly by users for ferrying data.
As of May, 2021, Helium has over 40,000 active hotspots with
1,000 new hotspots coming online every day. This deployment is
decentralized – 84% of users own at most three hotspots. Some
support infrastructure remains highly centralized, however, with
over 99% of data traffic routed through one cloud endpoint and
multiple cities in which all hotspots rely on one ISP for backhaul.
Helium is largely speculative today with more hotspot activity
than user activity. Crowdsourced, incentive-guided infrastructure
deployment largely works but shows evidence of gamification and
apathy. As Helium lacks clear, radio-oriented coverage maps, we
develop and test coverage models based on network incentives.
Finally, empirical testing with IoT devices finds basic success, but
uncovers numerous reliability issues.

1 INTRODUCTION
Core to the success of the Smart City will be its supporting in-
frastructure. While the edge devices are ready, there is not yet a
widely-deployed supporting communication infrastructure suited
to their needs. Embedded systems are defined by the walls, side-
walks, and windows into which they are literally embedded. For
this network, scale will come not from millions of devices sending
millions of bytes but billions of devices sending thousands of bytes.
As we pack more wireless devices into the same 3D space, we
need more supporting infrastructure. The need for small cells for
IoT-class devices was predicted and quantified by Mark Weiser [23]
and recently refined by Ghena et al. for the modern IoT [6]. Pragmat-
ically, this means the rollout of infrastructure capable of supporting
IoT-class devices across wide geographic areas with density pro-
portionate to the number of deployed nodes.
On the surface, this problem does not sound different from tradi-
tional cellular systems. However, with the emergence of the Helium
network, we see the emergence of a new approach to deploying this
infrastructure. Rather than relying on one or a few large entities to
deploy many million IoT base stations, Helium invites many million
individuals to deploy one or two base stations.
Helium released their first infrastructure product, a LoRa gate-
way called the Helium Hotspot, in the fall of 2019. Today, the Helium
company does not manufacture any hotspot hardware. Rather, five
(and growing) third-party companies have Helium-compliant prod-
uct lines, and over 1,000 Helium hotspots now come online every
day. These hotspots are purchased by individual investors, which
distributes the requisite capital, and risk, widely.
To manage and administer this decentralized network, Helium
built a custom blockchain. The use of a blockchain enables a micro-
transaction model not otherwise easily accessible. Each packet for
an IoT devices costs just $0.00001 USD, which can be paid directly
to the infrastructure owner. Interestingly, the development of a
new cryptocurrency, and its (initial) ability to mint coins, further
enables Helium to “pay” infrastructure operators without needing
to immediately raise fiat. If Helium is successful, payment for use
of the network will raise the value of the new currency enough1
for hotspot owners to recoup investment and turn a profit.
Now is a very interesting time to study the Helium network. The
network is big enough to see trends but also still early enough to
make changes. The infrastructure is beginning to see exponential
1In practice, speculation has done this already. Hotspots pay for themselves in a few
weeks, but we do not view the current valuation of the HNT token as sustainable if
the paying user base does not grow as well.

growth but some of the associated challenges of scale as well. There
remains very little data traffic, although we do see steady growth
over the course of our analysis. In short, this is a new model for
deploying and managing wireless infrastructure, and now that it is
beginning to see real adoption, we aim to study how well it works.
As the first study of Helium, the research questions we ask are
exploratory: What does a decentralized network topology look
like, and how does it change over time? Who is using the Helium
network, and how much do they use it? How does this decentralized
network sustain itself? How well does the network perform and
how reliable is it?
To start, we look at what we can learn from analyzing transac-
tions on the blockchain. We are most interested in understanding
this new model of distributed wireless infrastructure. Thus we focus
in Section 4 on hotspots, where we investigate what we can learn of
the physical deployment, the people and organizations who choose
to invest and deploy, and how the infrastructure evolves over time.
In Section 5, although there is only a small user base, we see what
we can learn how users use Helium today and what we may be able
to learn about users when adoption grows.
One of Helium’s major selling points is that it is a “decentralized
wireless network.” Helium relies on existing wireline providers for
hotspot backhaul, who it may ultimately compete with on hotspot
deployments. Hotspots are deployed by non-experts, which may
place them behind NATs, firewalls, or other uncontrolled middle-
boxes. In Section 6, we investigate how the connectivity of uncon-
trolled, crowdsourced infrastructure may affect the robustness and
performance of Helium.
While hotspot deployment is uncontrolled, it is not without di-
rection. Helium employs a governance-by-incentive model—i.e.,
those who deploy honestly and in the best interest of the network
should reap the most rewards. In Section 7, we look into how well
some of the incentive-based rules are, or are not, working. We in-
vestigate case studies of incentives and provide insights for possible
future refinement of both incentive enforcement and design.
Finally, Section 8 asks the empirical question, how well does He-
lium work as a wireless network? In particular, we investigate how
well a Helium user might expect the network to work in practice—
i.e., where is there supposed to be network coverage, and how well
does the network perform in the covered areas? Helium’s incen-
tives are designed to promote wide-area coverage, so we use these
incentives as a baseline to develop coverage models. We then mea-
sure Helium’s raw performance as well as its expected performance
based on the incentive-derived models. While Helium today is per-
haps adequate for best-effort service, the current infrastructure is
not yet reliable. It delivers only around 70% packets in a controlled,
best-case scenario and provides unpredictable geo-spatial coverage,
even in areas with dense hotspot deployments.
2 HELIUM – QUICK OVERVIEW
Helium is a new wireless provider. The initial focus of Helium is
on building crowdsourced hotspot infrastructure to provide wide-
area LoRa coverage. LoRa is one of several new radio technologies
competing to provide coverage for low-power, low-bandwidth edge
devices (IoT-class devices). In contrast to traditional wireless infras-
tructure, Helium does not own the deployed LoRa base stations.
23
Rather, individuals purchase, deploy, and maintain Helium hotspots
in exchange for payment for coverage and for the data that their
hotspot ferries. The Helium company built and sold the initial
hotspots, maintains firmware for new third-party, mass-produced
hotspots, develops supporting cloud infrastructure, and develops
the blockchain that underpins the network.
We focus on Helium’s LoRa network. However, Helium has
announced an expansion to 5G [7]. In Section 9.2 we consider how
the results of this study reflect on the future of Helium more broadly.
2.1 Helium from a Basic User’s Perspective
We first explain how Helium works for end users. To deploy a LoRa
device that uses the Helium network, such as a sensor, a user first
registers a new application with the Helium Console (a Helium-
provided cloud service that acts as a LoRaWAN router plus Helium
wallet). Users could deploy their own Console equivalent, but as we
will show later in our analysis, the vast majority do not and simply
rely on the Helium Console. Next, users deposit money in their Con-
sole account to pay for future data. Then, they must register a new
device with the Console, which gives configuration parameters for
the device’s networking stack (blindly copied #defines prepended
to a Helium library). After this, the device is ready to deploy: it
can now send and receive packets from the Helium network. In the
field, packets sent by devices are received by hotspots, who forward
their data to the Console, which pays hotspots and provides packet
payloads to application users via HTTP (or numerous other means).
2.2 Components of the Helium Network
Next, we look “under the hood” to see how Helium actually works.
Summarized in Figure 1, the Helium network is built on top of the
the LoRaWAN network architecture. LoRaWAN is a cloud-based
protocol that routes LoRa packets between wireless devices and
cloud services. The primary difference from LoRaWAN is that He-
lium makes it possible to have crowdsourced hotspots to bridge
cloud services with the LoRa wireless network; LoRaWAN requires
application owners to deploy and operate their own hotspots. He-
lium adds routing by overloading identifiers in LoRaMAC that
normally identify the device and its owning application.
The following describes each component of the Helium network:
Routers are cloud servers which manage the LoRaWAN protocol
across devices and applications. They are responsible for authen-
ticating devices and receiving messages from devices. Hotspots
find Helium-compliant routers by looking up device owners us-
ing packet metadata and a filter list in the Helium blockchain (in
contrast to standard LoRaWAN, where gateways have one, stati-
cally configured router). Helium routers must also negotiate with
hotspots to pay for data. This is done via the state_channel mecha-
nism described later. Anyone can host their own Helium compatible
LoRaWAN router by purchasing device and application identifiers
via a transaction on the blockchain.
Edge Devices are the LoRa-enabled end wireless devices. They
can be embedded in products such as sensors, collars, or tags and
can be used for a variety of applications including environmental,
pet, or asset monitoring. Devices are pre-provisioned with a Device
End User Identifier (EUI), an Application EUI, and an App key. These
are used during Over The Air Activation (OTAA), part of LoRaWAN,

Figure 1: Helium Overview. Edge devices broadcast packets over the LoRa PHY. One or more nearby infrastructure nodes—hotspots—
recover this packet. Helium Routers pay hotspots to release packets from edge devices they wish to recover data from. Routers must be
reliably available as the LoRa protocol requires that any downlink responses from the router arrive at the edge device within one second.
to authenticate to a LoRaWAN Router (i.e., a cloud service). Helium
differs from LoRaWAN in that EUIs are first used to look up Helium
Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs). These determine which
router to authenticate to.
Packet Forwarders are LoRa wireless modules in hotspots.
These use the industry-standard Semtech packet forwarder [16] to
relay edge device radio packets to and from the co-resident miner
in the hotspot (in regular LoRaWAN, these are forwarded directly
to the owning router; the miner is new from Helium). They are gen-
erally made up of a LoRa concentrator, which is a radio transceiver
capable of operating on multiple parallel subbands and a supporting
processor which runs the packet forwarder.
Miners transmit encapsulated LoRa packet payloads to and from
Helium routers and maintain the Helium blockchain. A miner is
usually a small embedded Linux device.2 Miners receive Helium
tokens (HNT) as rewards for device data transit, network coverage
validation, and blockchain consensus activities. They send traffic
to LoRaWAN routers on the internet at large using any UDP/IP
capable backhaul-like wireline (e.g., Cable and DSL) or wireless
(e.g., LTE) Internet access networks.
Hotspots are physical boxes with a packet forwarder and a
miner. Hotspots make up the majority of deployed Helium infras-
tructure to date.3 In principle, forwarders and miners could be
separated, as the connection is simply an IP link. In practice, they
are co-located to overcome a short-term engineering limitation:
“The protocol between the gateway and the server is purposefully
very basic and for demonstration purpose only, or for use on private
and reliable networks. There is no authentication of the gateway or
the server, and the acknowledges are only used for network quality
assessment, not to correct UDP datagrams losses (no retries).”4
Helium Console – The Console is a cloud service provided by
Helium which acts as a Helium router. Instead of buying an OUI and
running their own router, users deploying end devices can opt to
use the Console. At this time, the Console charges users wholesale
for data communicated with sensors and has no overhead cost.
Validators are a new class of Helium node, currently in testing,
that will take over blockchain maintenance events from miners.
2e.g. in the Rak Wireless v1.5 hotspot, the miner is an off-the-shelf Raspberry Pi 4
Model B – see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUrAb2GoHhc for more detail.
3Very early, Helium permitted a small batch of “DIY Hardware.” New hotspots must
be from certified vendors to earn rewards on the network.

The proposal (HIP25) to introduce validators was ratified in January
2021. Validators solve well-known scalability and robustness chal-
lenges for blockchains and use well-known staking techniques. As
