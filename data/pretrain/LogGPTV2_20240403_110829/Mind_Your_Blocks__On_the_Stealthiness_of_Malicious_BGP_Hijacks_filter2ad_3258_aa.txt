**Abstract:**
Recent research has provided evidence that blocks of IP addresses are being stolen by BGP hijackers to launch spam campaigns. This marked the first documented instance of BGP hijacks in the wild. Since then, only a few anecdotal cases have been reported, leading some to believe that such attacks are not widespread. However, network operators and ISPs commonly suspect that these attacks are occurring more frequently than reported. In this paper, we analyze 18 months of data collected from an infrastructure specifically designed to detect and study these incidents. Our analysis identified over 2,000 suspected malicious BGP hijacks, confirming the existence of these stealthy attacks. The lack of ground truth is a challenge, but we received confirmation from an ISP that was inadvertently involved in some of the detected hijacks. This paper aims to raise awareness about this underdocumented threat and to encourage further research into the motivations behind these attacks and potential mitigation strategies. Given that as much as 20% of the IPv4 address space is currently allocated but not publicly announced, it is particularly vulnerable to such malicious BGP hijacks.

**1. Introduction**
The current Internet routing infrastructure is known to be susceptible to BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) hijacking, a technique where attackers take control of IP address blocks without the consent of the legitimate owners. BGP, the de facto inter-domain routing protocol, relies on trust among interconnected autonomous systems (ASes). While accidental BGP hijacks, often attributed to misconfigurations, are well-documented, intentional and malicious hijacks are less understood. A few cases of accidental hijacks have been publicly disclosed on network operational mailing lists like NANOG and in blog posts. Techniques for detecting BGP hijacks have been proposed to help network operators monitor their own prefixes and respond quickly to potential outages. However, these methods suffer from a high false-positive rate, which is still acceptable to many users as they are primarily interested in alerts related to their own networks.
