Abstract—Some recent research presented evidence of blocks
of IP addresses being stolen by BGP hijackers to launch spam
campaigns
[35]. This was the ﬁrst time BGP hijacks were
seen in the wild. Since then, only a very few anecdotal cases
have been reported as if hackers were not interested in running
these attacks. However, it is a common belief among network
operators and ISPs that these attacks could be taking place
but, so far, no one has produced evidence to back up that
claim. In this paper, we analyse 18 months of data collected
by an infrastructure speciﬁcally built to answer that question:
are intentional stealthy BGP hijacks routinely taking place in
the Internet? The identiﬁcation of what we believe to be more
than 2,000 malicious hijacks leads to a positive answer. The lack
of ground truth is, of course, a problem but we managed to get
conﬁrmation of some of our ﬁndings thanks to an ISP unwittingly
involved in hijack cases we have spotted. This paper aims at
being an eye opener for the community by shedding some light
on this undocumented threat. We also hope that it will spur new
research to understand why these hijacks are taking place and
how they can be mitigated. Depending on how BGP attacks are
carried out, they can be very disruptive for the whole Internet
and should be looked at very closely. As of today, as much as
20% of the whole IPv4 address space is currently allocated but
not publicly announced, which makes it potentially vulnerable to
such malicious BGP hijacks.

INTRODUCTION
The current Internet routing infrastructure is known to
be vulnerable to BGP hijacking which consists in taking
control of blocks of IP addresses without any consent of the
legitimate owners. This is due to the fact that BGP [36], the
de facto inter-domain routing protocol, relies on the concept
of trust among interconnected autonomous systems (ASes).
Accidental, not necessarily malicious, BGP hijack incidents are
known to occur in the Internet. They are generally attributed to
misconﬁgurations. A few cases have received public disclosure
on network operational mailing lists, such as NANOG, or blog
posts [12], [15], [16], [21]. Techniques to detect these BGP
hijacks have been proposed to help network operators monitor
their own preﬁxes to react quickly to such possible outages.
These approaches suffer from a very high false-positive rate
