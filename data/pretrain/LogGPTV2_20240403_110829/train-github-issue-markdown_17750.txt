We got the following warning message:
    warning: variant is never used: `Foo`, #[warn(dead_code)] on by default
For this code:
    enum Something {
        Foo,
        NotFoo
    }
    fn main() {
        match Something::NotFoo {
            Something::Foo => {}
            _ => {}
        }
    }
This warning could mislead users because for them, the Foo variant is used.
Adding a specific warning message could be nice.
@eddyb proposed this message instead in this case:
"this variant is never instantiated"
