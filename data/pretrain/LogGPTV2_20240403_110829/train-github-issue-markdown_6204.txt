Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
When importing an undefined named import, it doesn't produce any warning or
error in build, but fail at runtime. I am using babel-preset-env, with
`modules: false`.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
a.js
    import { getDef, getUndef } from './b.js';
    getDef();     // works
    getUndef();   // throws
b.js
    export const getDef = () => 'defined';
**What is the expected behavior?**
I would expect webpack to produce an error, because the named import doesn't
exist.
**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing
the behavior?**
Got bit by this many times, and I think it should be a build check instead of
a runtime check.
**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version,
Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**
OS: MacOSX 10.13.2  
Node: 8.10.3  
Webpack: 3.10.0  
babel/preset-env: 7.0.0-beta.34
Thanks in advance!
