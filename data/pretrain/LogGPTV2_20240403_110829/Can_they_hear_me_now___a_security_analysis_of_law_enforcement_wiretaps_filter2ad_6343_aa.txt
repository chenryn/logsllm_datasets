ABSTRACT
Although modern communications services are susceptible
to third-party eavesdropping via a wide range of possible
techniques, law enforcement agencies in the US and other
countries generally use one of two technologies when they
conduct legally-authorized interception of telephones and
other communications traﬃc. The most common of these,
designed to comply with the 1994 Communications Assis-
tance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), use a standard
interface provided in network switches.
This paper analyzes the security properties of these inter-
faces. We demonstrate that the standard CALEA interfaces
are vulnerable to a range of unilateral attacks by the inter-
cept target. In particular, because of poor design choices in
the interception architecture and protocols, our experiments
show it is practical for a CALEA-tapped target to over-
whelm the link to law enforcement with spurious signaling
messages without degrading her own traﬃc, eﬀectively pre-
venting call records as well as content from being monitored
or recorded. We also identify stop-gap mitigation strategies
that partially mitigate some of our identiﬁed attacks.

various capabilities for law enforcement wiretapping (some-
times called “lawful access”) into their networks. CALEA
requirements ﬁrst applied only to traditional voice telephone
services provided by telephone companies (wireline analog,
ISDN, cellular voice, etc). In recent years, however, the law
has been interpreted to also cover many data services (such
as 3G cellular Internet access) and non-traditional voice ser-
vices (such as VoIP services oﬀered by cable companies).
Most service providers comply with CALEA by using equip-
ment that provides a standard interface, deﬁned jointly by
the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and Al-
liance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) in
ANSI Standard J-STD-025 (often referred to in the industry
simply as the “J-standard”) [3] for transmitting intercepted
traﬃc to a law enforcement agency1.
CALEA was, and continues to be, controversial. Criti-
cism of CALEA, and wiretap-capability mandates in gen-
eral, has centered largely on questions of whether the pro-
vision of an explicit interface for wiretaps on every switch
in a network inevitably makes the national communications
infrastructure vulnerable to illegal, unauthorized abuse by
the government or others [20]2.
In this paper, we focus on a diﬀerent question: whether
the standard interfaces used for most CALEA wiretaps are
vulnerable to manipulation by wiretap targets in ways that
prevent accurate authorized intercepts of their traﬃc from
being collected.
In previous work, we found that wiretap subjects can ma-
nipulate loop extender wiretapping technology used by law
enforcement to tap analog telephone lines, enabling the tar-
get to unilaterally disable content recording, cause incor-
rect dialed numbers to be recorded, and interject spurious
records into the interception record [28]. Many of these vul-
nerabilities resulted from the use of in-band signaling in loop
extender systems. By injecting spurious control signals, the
target could manipulate the wiretap.
The newer CALEA architecture establishes a separate out-
of-band channel to communicate signaling information be-
tween the telephone service provider (TSP) and the law en-
forcement agency (LEA). Surprisingly, although separating
signaling information from call content removes (at least in
1This paper focuses speciﬁcally on law enforcement wire-
taps. US intelligence agencies also conduct wiretaps, but
the technologies used for them are beyond the scope of this
paper. See e.g., [5] for a discussion of the technical aspects
of the NSA’s domestic wiretap technology.
2And indeed, these concerns appear to have been validated
by, for example, a recent incident of large-scale wiretapping
in a Greek cellular network [23].
512principle) many of the previously discovered vulnerabilities,
the CALEA design introduces several entirely new vulnera-
bilities. While our existing work suggested that CALEA sys-
tems may be less susceptible to manipulation than the loop
extender technology they replaced [28], this paper shows
that the opposite appears to be true.
Unlike traditional wiretapping countermeasures (e.g., en-
cryption), the attacks outlined in this paper can be con-
ducted unilaterally by individual wiretap targets, and aﬀect
the accuracy not only of the captured content, but also of
the captured metadata record (who called whom and when).
Although encryption obfuscates communication content, it
does not conceal the identities of the communicating partic-
ipants. Coupled with the results of our prior work [28], the
vulnerabilities identiﬁed in this paper raise signiﬁcant ques-
tions about the reliability of wiretap evidence and suggest
that the bulk of the wiretapping technologies currently em-
ployed by law enforcement are largely incapable of reliable
evidence collection in the face of relatively simple counter-
measures.
In particular, we ﬁnd that CALEA-based wiretaps of many
current communications services are readily vulnerable to
denial-of-service by a wiretap target. Perhaps most signiﬁ-
cantly, we found practical attacks that a wiretap target can
employ to overwhelm the low-bandwidth signaling channel
of the J-STD-025 interface. Signaling events generated by
the target (such as taking a telephone oﬀ-hook) are encoded
for transmission in a way that consumes far more bandwidth
on the (low bandwidth) law enforcement signaling link than
on the target’s own link. A wiretapped subject can exploit
this by generating a moderate volume of spurious signaling
events that reliably exhausts the capacity of the signaling
link to the law enforcement agency for all wiretap targets
connected to a given switch, without signiﬁcant degradation
of service to the targets’ actual traﬃc. This eﬀectively pre-
vents the law enforcement agency from accurately collecting
or recording the true call metadata as well as the associated
data traﬃc or audio content.
As we will see, these vulnerabilities largely arise from nar-
row engineering choices in the CALEA architecture rooted
in assumptions about “average case” workloads. However,
a motivated wiretap subject may intentionally violate these
assumptions to overwhelm the resources of the wiretap. This
is especially true with wireless telephone services (which ac-
count for the vast majority of law enforcement wiretaps [2]),
where voice services are increasingly bundled with moderate-
and high-bandwidth data services.
This paper has four main contributions:
• We provide the ﬁrst (in the public literature) security anal-
ysis of the technical standards used for a large fraction of
law enforcement telephone and data wiretaps in the United
States (as well as in other countries).
• We identify practical attacks against systems that imple-
ment the standard that cause incomplete or incorrect in-
terceptions, possibly without detection, in current imple-
mentations.
• We conduct experiments that demonstrate the feasibility
and practicality of our attacks.
In particular, we verify
that common US telecommunications carriers provide con-
sumers with suﬃcient resources to exhaust the capacity of
CALEA systems that implement the J-standard’s recom-
mended wiretap conﬁguration.
• We propose stopgap mitigation strategies that partially
mitigate some of our identiﬁed attacks.
Any weaknesses in CALEA wiretaps, of course, represent
a pressing problem for the many law enforcement agencies
that rely on them. But the failures have wider implications
as well. CALEA requirements are being adopted for an in-
creasingly broad range of communications platforms. Yet
there has been remarkably little published analysis of the
eﬀectiveness of the standards that are being mandated.
1.1 Wiretapping in the United States
The US laws governing electronic surveillance are arcane
and complex; a complete discussion is beyond the scope of
this paper. The law has its basis in the Fourth Amend-
ment with speciﬁc rules codiﬁed in various federal and state
statutes and case law interpretations that have evolved over
many years. For our purposes here it is suﬃcient to note a
few salient highlights of surveillance law as it applies to law
enforcement wiretaps.
In the US, broadly speaking and in general, surreptitious
third-party interception of telephone and network communi-
cation is illegal whether done by government or private indi-
viduals, with narrow exceptions for criminal investigations
and similar matters. Even when allowed, law enforcement
wiretaps must be conducted under court supervision, with
diﬀerent requirements and standards that must be met de-
pending on the kinds of information being collected. The
procedures and requirements for Federal law enforcement
wiretaps are codiﬁed in Title III [33]; most states have es-
sentially similar rules.
Diﬀerent kinds of wiretaps have diﬀerent legal require-
ments. The most stringent legal standards apply to wiretaps
that intercept the content of communication (e.g., telephone
call audio, text messages, etc.). These taps are permitted
only if the court is convinced there is suﬃcient probable
cause and that the interception is essential to an investiga-
tion. Pen register3 intercepts, which seek only metadata or
call-identifying information (a transcript of who communi-
cated with whom and when) can meet a lower legal standard.
All that is required, in general, for such taps is an assertion
that the speciﬁc records involved are likely to be germane
to a investigation, and pen registers requests are not usually
subject to extensive case-by-case judicial approval. Most
law enforcement taps are in this category, although it is not
unusual for evidence obtained from a pen register to be used
to support a request for a warrant for a content tap.
1.2 Wiretapping Technology
In principle, there are many possible approaches for third-
party recording of analog and digital telephone and data
communications, depending on the network topology and
the access and other capabilities of the wiretapper. Inter-
ception might be performed at the wireline link between the
target and the network (the “local loop” in telephony par-
lance), within the network itself, or by surreptitious “bugs”
placed in the target’s own hardware or software. Wireless
devices, such as cellular phones, can introduce an additional
option: capturing and demodulating the radio signals.
3Named after the (now historical) electro-mechanical chart
recorders once used to conduct them. They are also called
dialed number recorder taps.
513Loop extenders: Tapping the local loop
Histori-
cally, the favored approach for law enforcement wiretapping
in the US has been to tap the target’s local loop. For analog
wireline telephone calls, relatively little special hardware is
required at the tap point; it is suﬃcient simply to connect
a second pair of wires leading back to the law enforcement
agency’s facilities. To make such taps less detectable and to
ensure proper isolation and level equalization of intercepted
content, however, law enforcement agencies use a small de-
vice called a loop extender at the splice point. The device
copies the audio on the subject’s line over to the law en-
forcement line, re-encodes signals, and performs level equal-
ization. Collection equipment at the law enforcement agency
decodes the dialed digit and other call processing signals and
can record the audio contents of the calls.
Digital communications can often also be tapped at the
local loop, but the interception equipment and techniques
may need to be more sophisticated to capture accurately the
complex, higher bandwidth signal encodings used in such
modern systems. Tapping some services in this way can
entail the use of highly specialized (and relatively expensive)
equipment, and as bandwidth becomes greater and signal
encodings become more complex, the loop interception can
become correspondingly more diﬃcult to perform.
CALEA: Tapping in the switch
A newer wiretap-
ping technology used by law enforcement agencies – and
the subject of this paper – is based on the 1994 CALEA
law. CALEA wiretaps are distinguished from loop exten-
ders by performing the interception not at the subscriber’s
local loop, but rather within the switching equipment of the
network provider, allowing more context-sensitive capture of
digital as well as analog communications.
CALEA mandates a standard set of capabilities for wire-
taps in telephone (and certain other communications) switches.
In these taps, the switch (not the law enforcement agency)
decodes the call signaling information and, when content
interception is performed, segregates content on a separate
channel from the signaling. As noted above, ANSI J-STD-025
standardizes a CALEA-compliant interface between switches
and law enforcement agencies.
The J-standard architecture and messages are described in
detail in the rest of this paper. Basically, a law enforcement
agency conducting CALEA interceptions typically leases one
or more telephone lines between the agency facilities and the
