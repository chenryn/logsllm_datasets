Virtualization
· With virtualization, the OS presents each user with just
the resources that user should see
· The user has access to a virtual machine (VM), which
contains those resources
. The user cannot access resources that are available to
the OS but exist outside the VM
· A hypervisor, or VM monitor, is the software that
implements a VM
· Translates access requests between the VM and the OS
· Can support multiple OSs in VMs simultaneously
· Honeypot: A VM meant to lure an attacker into an
environment that can be both controlled and monitored

·Methodsofsupportingseparation/sharing:
· Do not protect
· lsolate
· Share all or share nothing
· Share but limit access
· Limit use of an object

Principles of Secure OS Design
· Simplicity of design
· OSs are inherently complex, and any unnecessary complexity only
makes them harder to understand and secure
· Layered design
· Enables layered trust
· Layered trust
· Layering is both a way to keep a design logical and understandable
and a way to limit risk
· Example: very tight access controls on critical Os functions, fewer
access controls on important noncritical functions, and few if any
access controls on functions that aren't important to the OS

Kernelized Design
· A kernel is the part of the OS that performs the lowest-
level functions
· Synchronization
·Interprocesscommunication
· Message passing
· Interrupt handling
·A securitykernel is responsible for enforcing the security
mechanisms ofthe entire Os
·Typically contained within thekernel

TrustedSystems
·Atrusted system is onethat hasbeenshown towarrant
somedegreeoftrust that itwillperformcertainactivities
faithfully
. Characteristics of a trusted system:
·A defined policy that details what security qualities it enforces
security adequately
Independent scrutiny or evaluation to ensure that the mechanisms
have been selected and implemented properly

Other Trusted System Characteristics
. Secure startup
· System startup is a tricky time for security, as most systems load
basic I/O functionality before being able to load security functions
· Trusted path
· An unforgeable connection by which the user can be confident of
communicating directly with the Os
· Object reuse control
doesn't become compromised
·Audit
. Trusted systems track security-relevant changes, such as
installation of new programs or OS modification

Rootkits
· A rootkit is a malicious software package that
attainsand takes advantageof root status or
effectively becomes part of the OS
· Rootkits often goto great length to avoid being
discovered or, if discovered and partially
removed, to reestablish themselves
. This can include intercepting or modifying basic Os
functions

Summary
· OSs have evolved from supporting single users and
single programs to many users and programs at once
· Resources that require OS protection: memory, I/O
devices, programs, and networks
and to separate critical functions from noncritical ones
· Resource access control can be enforced in a number of
ways, including virtualization, segmentation, hardware
memory protection, and reference monitors
· Rootkits are malicious software packages that attain root
status or effectively become part of the OS
