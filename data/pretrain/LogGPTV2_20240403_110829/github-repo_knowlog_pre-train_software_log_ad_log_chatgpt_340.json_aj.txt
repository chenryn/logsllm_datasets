  "ARPT: 681387.132167: AirPort_Brcm43xx::powerChange: System Wake - Full Wake/ Dark Wake / Maintenance wake",  "This log entry is indicating that a change in the power state of the AirPort_Brcm43xx module occurred at a specific time, which is represented as a Unix timestamp (in this case, 681387.132167). The power change itself is noted as being a \"System Wake\", which can refer to different states of device activation. In this case, the wake is further described as a \"Full Wake\"/\"Dark Wake\"/\"Maintenance wake\", which may be specific to the operating system or software being used.\n\nA \"Full Wake\" generally refers to a complete recovery from a low-power state, where all system resources are active and available for use. A \"Dark Wake\" typically refers to a partial wake or low-power mode, where certain processes or functions may remain active while others are paused or disabled. A \"Maintenance Wake\" may be a specific type of Dark Wake that is triggered to perform system maintenance tasks.\n\nWithout additional context, it is difficult to determine the exact cause or implications of this power change for the AirPort_Brcm43xx module. However, this log entry may be useful for troubleshooting power management issues or monitoring system performance over time."

  "Internal name did not resolve to internal address!",  "The log message \"Internal name did not resolve to internal address!\" indicates that a computer or network device was unable to resolve the internal domain name to its corresponding internal IP address. This can occur when there is a problem with the domain name system (DNS) or the network configuration. If the DNS server is unable to resolve the domain name, it could indicate a problem with the DNS server or the network connection to the DNS server. Additionally, if the network configuration is incorrect, the device may not be able to communicate with the DNS server to resolve the domain name. Troubleshooting steps may include verifying network connectivity, DNS server configuration, and DNS resolution settings on the affected device."

  "Central manager is not powered on",  "The log indicates that the central manager device is not powered on. This means that the device is not receiving any electrical power and is therefore not operational. The central manager is a critical component in a system or network as it is responsible for managing and supervising the other devices in the system.\n\nThere could be several reasons why the central manager is not powered on. It could be due to a power outage, a faulty power supply, or a malfunctioning device. If the device has not been powered on for an extended period, it could also be due to an issue with the device's battery.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the first step would be to verify that the power source is working correctly. If the power source is functioning correctly, and the central manager still does not power on, then further investigation is required. This may include examining the device's power supply and battery, checking for any damaged power cords or connectors, and inspecting the device for any signs of physical damage. By diagnosing the issue and taking the necessary steps to resolve it, the central manager device can be brought back online, and the system can resume normal operations."
