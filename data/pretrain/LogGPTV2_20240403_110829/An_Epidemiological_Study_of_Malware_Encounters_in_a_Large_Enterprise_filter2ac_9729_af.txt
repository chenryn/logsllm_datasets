APPENDIX
A. MALWARE TYPE
According to McAfee’s virus naming convention,9 malware
names consist of a preﬁx and sufﬁx. The preﬁx speciﬁes the type
of ﬁle or platform the malware targets (e.g., JS, PDF, W32), or its
“class” (e.g., Adware, Backdoor, Exploit, KeyLog). The sufﬁx(es)
designate variants of a malware, the byte size of the binary, or addi-
tional information about its type. In our McAfee dataset, there are
9,577 unique malware names. By stripping away the sufﬁx we are
left with 1,097 unique malware names.
The top two malware names, encountered by 5.47% and 1.73%
of the hosts, respectively, are “Artemis” and “Generic.” The for-
mer is not a malware family, but McAfee’s name for those detected
heuristically. The latter seems to be a generic detection that lacks
addition information. Excluding these two, the encounter rates of
the top 20 malware are shown in Figure 12. The shading of the
boxes denote the encounter rate for that malware in that country.
Rows (and columns) are sorted according to a hierarchical cluster-
ing algorithm to minimize the Euclidean distance between adjacent
rows (and columns).
Figure 12: The encounter rate in each country for the top 20 mal-
ware. The top ten countries with the most number of malware-
encountering hosts are plotted.
Some patterns emerge from Figure 12. First, the malware en-
countered differs by geographic location. Some can be found in
all countries (e.g., ”RDN/Generic,” “Generic Downloader”), while
others are speciﬁc to certain locations (e.g., Autorun malware and
worms in India and Egypt, and exploits in Western countries). Sec-
ondly, the diversity of malware in each country varies widely. Hosts
in India encountered more than 300 different malware, while those
in the U.K. only encountered 72. This suggests that the difference
in the encounter rate per country may be partially due to the abun-
dance of malware, and the types of malware, in that region.
To gain further insight about the categories of malware, we lever-
age the “class” information assigned by McAfee. The class key-
word, e.g., Adware, Backdoor, Exploit, when available, is included
in the preﬁx of the malware name. We ﬁnd the malware class
present in around 29.23% of the McAfee reports. Figure 13 shows
the encounter rate of each malware class in each country.

C. ADDITIONAL RELATED WORK
In addition to the studies discussed in Section 5, several other
studies have been conducted that deserve mention, albeit while us-
ing different methodologies and providing less directly comparable
results.
Regional differences:
In a study of malware distributed via pay-
per-install services, Caballero et al. [2] witnessed families of mal-
ware preferentially delivered to the U.S. and Europe, and others
exclusively targeted to a single country. Kleiner et al. [6] exam-
ined the impact of socio-economic factors in a country or region on
malware infections. They also found countries that implement poli-
cies for investigating and prosecuting cybercrime offenses to have
a lower infection rate.
Internet-wide studies: Numerous studies have investigated the
characteristics of malware proliferation by studying trafﬁc sent by
apparently infected machines (scans, spam, denial-of-service pack-
ets, etc.) on the public Internet. For example, using the malicious
trafﬁc observed at the border of a large network, Collins et al. [5]
demonstrated the tendency of malware infections to cluster within
the same networks (identiﬁed by CIDR blocks) over time and how
this tendency can be used to predict where such infections will
likely occur in the future. Ramachandran and Feamster [16] and
Xie et al. [21] studied spam feeds to quantify, at the granularity
of autonomous systems, where spam bots most often arise; the
Xie et al. study further noted that the top ﬁve autonomous sys-
tems by this measure are all Internet service providers that offer
residential network access. Zhang et al. [22] also found that “mis-
managed” autonomous systems, such as those that have open DNS
resolvers, lack egress ﬁltering, allow untrusted HTTPS certiﬁcates,
etc., are more likely to be responsible for malicious activities.
User behavior: Also distantly related are ethnographic stud-
ies focused on other online behaviors and threats. For example,
Sheng et al. [17] used Mechanical Turk to evaluate how gender,
age, technical knowledge, risk perception for ﬁnancial investment,
and prior exposure to anti-phishing training impacted susceptibility
to phishing attacks in a role-playing exercise. Via an online survey
of 449 participants, Milne et al. [13] studied the relationships of
both participant self-efﬁcacy and demographics (e.g., age) to the
participants’ online behaviors. Lee [8] conducted an epidemiologi-
cal study in an academic environment and determined that the em-
ployees’ department and job type are indicative of their suscepti-
bility to targeted phishing attacks. In an academic study with 164
participants, Onarlioglu et al. [15] found that non-technical users
demonstrated an ability comparable to that of security experts in
Figure 13: The encounter rate of each malware class in each coun-
try. The top ten countries with the most number of malware-
encountering hosts are plotted.
The top malware class, “Exploit,” is encountered by 3.67% of the
hosts. It seems to be especially common in India, Brazil, and South
Korea, who share a similar makeup of malware classes. China
stands out as having the highest “Dropper” encounter rate, perhaps
due to the abundance of custom, free software available online in
that region.10
Findings: Malware types differ by geographic location, some tar-
geting speciﬁc regions while others are common to all countries.
Exploits are the most common malware class in our dataset, partic-
ularly prevalent in India, Brazil, and S. Korea. Droppers are mostly
found in China (possibly related to the abundance of custom, free
software available online in that region). Exploits primarily target
vulnerabilities in Javascript and Java, though a non-trivial fraction
of hosts also encountered PDF exploits and those targeting the Win-
dows Shell.
B. FILE SYSTEM LOCATION CATE-
GORIES
We group McAfee reports into the following categories, based
on the paths of detected malicious ﬁles:
• External drives: The ﬁle was found on high-lettered drives
(i.e., F and above) or is named “autorun.inf” located directly
in the root directory of the drive. Even though personal ma-
chines can have multiple internal, physical drives, enterprise-
owned PCs were placed under a relatively restrictive conﬁgu-
ration policy. All were shipped with identical conﬁgurations
except in special cases. Employees were also not given admin-
istrator privileges on their machines by default. As a result, the
vast majority of hosts have only drives C and D.
• Temporary ﬁles: The ﬁle was found under a temporary
folder in the application directory (e.g., “C:\Users\User
Name\AppData\Local\Temp”). This folder is commonly
used to store secondary downloads by an initial infection.
• Web cache: The ﬁle was found in the browser’s cache, e.g.,
in the “Temporary Internet Files” directory, or the
“cache” folder under the browser’s directory. In this case, the
malware likely arrived on the victim through drive-by down-
loads.
in the default
The ﬁle was found on the user’s desktop
or
folder storing downloaded ﬁles (e.g.,
“C:\Users\User Name\Downloads”). This is often as-
sociated with intentional downloads performed by the user.
• Application: The ﬁle was found under the applications data di-
rectory, which stores user-speciﬁc application information, in-
cluding conﬁguration ﬁles, default templates, etc. An example
directory path is “C:\Documents and Settings\User
Name\Application Data\.”

detecting more unusual and sophisticated ones.
Server compromises: Orthogonal to our study of host malware
encounters, Vasek and Moore [20] explored factors relating to the
compromise of web servers. Speciﬁcally, they quantiﬁed the rela-
tionship between compromise and the type of web server, type of
content management system (CMS), hosting country, and secure
administration practices demonstrated on the website using logistic
regression models.
D. EMPLOYEE JOB TYPES
In this section, we summarize each job type introduced in Sec-
tion 3.3, including the fraction of all users with that job type and a
brief description of the job type.
• Engineer (27.88%) Software engineers comprise 28% of the
employees under this job type, and systems engineers another
23%. These are followed by support engineers (16%), ser-
vice engineers (11%), quality engineers (8%). There are also
hardware engineers (2%), solutions engineers (1%), test engi-
neers (0.75%), ﬁeld engineers (0.54%), performance engineers
(0.36%), etc.
• Manager (19.32%) Account managers, which are under the
sales department, make up a quarter of the “manager” employ-
ees, and project, program, and product managers another quar-
ter. Engineering managers make up another 9% of the employ-
ees of this type, and customer service and tech support 5%.
• Specialist (6.52%) The majority or employees with this job
type (70%) are responsible for maintaining special hardware
and systems, or providing support for integrating products into
customer environments. Another 11% of the employees are as-
sociated with business operations, sales, and marketing.
• Analyst (4.67%) 55% of the employees with this job type
are business operations analysts or ﬁnancial and revenue ana-
lysts. There are also process operations (7%), engineering (6%),
maintenance (6%) analysts, and others that deal with processes,
inventory, supply chain, logistics.
partment, e.g., account, renewals, and sales representatives.
• Consultant (4.41%) About half of the employee with this job
type simply have “Consultant” as their job title, hence it is dif-
ﬁcult to determine their expertise. However, we do ﬁnd 15% of
the employees with this job type to be practice or advisory con-
sultants, 9% to be business consultants, and 7% to be technical
consultants.
• Director (3.17%) Directors are typically a level up from man-
agers, and span across all business units in the enterprise. 18%
of the employees with this job type are in sales or marketing,
16% in business and products, 15% in engineering.
• Architect (2.81%) 84% of the employees of this type are So-
lutions Architects, who are primarily responsible for designing
and integrating hardware and software systems. Another 9% of
the employees of this job type simply have “Architect” as their
job title. There are also technology, application, information,
data, storage, and network architects.
• Representative (1.58%) These employees are in the sales de-
• Technician (1.40%) 45% of the employees with this job type
are either test or debug technicians, 12% are engineering tech-
nicians, and 11% are customer support technicians. Employees
with this job type appear to deal mostly with hardware systems
rather than software.
• Administrator (1.15%) 41% of the employees with this job
type are system administrators, 22% are storage or database ad-
ministrators. There are also contract administrators (6%), dis-
trict administrators (5%), account administrators (3%).
• Coordinator (1.12%) These employees deal with logistics and
processes in the company. 30% of employees of this job type
are program or project coordinators, 21% are distribution coor-
dinators, 12% are human resources coordinators, and 11% are
inventory coordinators.
• Assistant (1.07%) 94% of employees with this job type are ex-
ecutive and administrative assistants that support administrative
duties in the ofﬁce. There is also a small fraction of legal assis-
tants, marketing assistants, and sales assistants.
