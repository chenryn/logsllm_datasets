### Configuring Address Groups and Enabling File Access

1. **Name the address group.**
2. **Add the IP address `10.221.41.33` to the address range to indicate the customer’s address.**
3. **Click OK.**
4. **Select your newly created address group.**
5. **In the right pane, select “Apple File Service” to enable file access.**
6. **Click Save.**

**Important Note:**
- When setting up filters, use very specific address ranges to block incoming SMTP mail. For example, if you set a filter on port 25 to deny mail from all addresses, you will prevent any mail from being delivered to your users.

### Chapter 3: IP Firewall Service

#### Common Network Administration Tasks Using Firewall Service

Your firewall is the first line of defense against unauthorized network intruders, malicious users, and network virus attacks. There are many ways such attacks can harm your data or misuse your network resources. This section lists some common uses of firewall service in network administration.

##### Preventing Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

When the server receives a TCP connection request from a client that is denied access, it sends a reply rejecting the connection by default. This stops the denied client from resending the request repeatedly. However, a malicious user can generate a series of TCP connection requests from a denied IP address, forcing the server to keep replying and locking out other legitimate connections. This is one type of Denial-of-Service attack.

**To prevent ping denial-of-service attacks:**

1. In Server Admin, choose **Firewall** from the **Computers & Services** list.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. Select the **General** tab.
4. Select the **Any** address group.
5. Deselect **ICMP Echo (ping) reply**.
6. Click **Save**.

**Important Note:**
- Denial-of-Service attacks are relatively rare, so make these settings only if you believe your server may be vulnerable. If you deny ICMP echo replies, services that use ping to locate network services will be unable to detect your server.

##### Controlling or Enabling Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network Usage

Network administrators sometimes need to control the use of P2P file-sharing applications, as they might consume network bandwidth and resources disproportionately or pose security and intellectual property risks.

**To cut off P2P networking:**

- Block all traffic incoming and outgoing on the port number used by the P2P application. You must determine the specific port for each P2P network. By default, Mac OS X Server’s firewall blocks all ports not specifically opened.

**To limit P2P network usage to IP addresses behind the firewall:**

- Open the P2P port for your LAN interface but continue to block the port on the WAN interface. See “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP ports” on page 51 for detailed instructions.

##### Controlling or Enabling Network Game Usage

Network administrators may also need to control the use of network games, which can similarly consume network resources disproportionately.

**To cut off network gaming:**

- Block all traffic incoming and outgoing on the port number used by the game. Determine the specific port for each network game. By default, Mac OS X Server’s firewall blocks all ports not specifically opened.

**To limit network game usage to IP addresses behind the firewall:**

- Open the appropriate port on your LAN interface but continue to block the port on the WAN interface. Some games require a connection to a gaming service, so this may not be fully effective. See “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP ports” on page 51 for detailed instructions.

**To allow certain games to connect to other players and game services outside the firewall:**

- Open the appropriate port on both your LAN and WAN interfaces. Some games require more than one port to be open. Consult the game’s documentation for networking details. See “Creating an Advanced IP Filter for TCP ports” on page 51 for detailed instructions.

#### Advanced Configuration

You may prefer to use a command-line interface and conventional configuration files to configure Mac OS X Server’s firewall service. This is useful if you have an existing `ipfw` configuration file to migrate or need greater control for troubleshooting or intrusion detection.

**Background:**

- When you click **Save** in Server Admin, all old rules are flushed, and new rules are loaded and applied immediately, whether the IP firewall service is running or not. The new rules are loaded from three sources:
  - Rules from the General and Advanced panels (stored in `/etc/ipfilter/ip_address_groups.plist`).
  - Manually configured `ipfw` rules, if any (stored in `/etc/ipfilter/ipfw.conf`).
  - NAT divert rule, if the NAT service is running.

**Precautions:**

- Using the Advanced panel or creating your own rules can put the server in a state where it is completely cut off from network access. This might require a reboot in single-user mode to restore network access. To avoid this, consider adding a cron job to disable the firewall periodically while testing rules. Be sure to disable this cron job when the machine is in production.

**Commands to disable and enable the firewall:**

- Disable the firewall: `sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=0`
- Enable the firewall: `sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.fw.enable=1`

These commands do not change the rules loaded into the firewall; they only determine whether those rules are applied.

#### Creating IP Filter Rules Using `ipfw`

You can use the `ipfw` command in conjunction with the firewall module of Server Admin to:

- Display rules created by the firewall module.
- Create filters with characteristics that cannot be defined using the firewall module.
- Count the number of times rules are applied.

**Important Note:**
- Do not modify rules created using the firewall module, as changes made to these rules are not permanent. The firewall service recreates any rules defined using the firewall module whenever the service is restarted.

**Summary of Rule Numbers:**

- **Rule Number 10:** Loop back.
- **Rule Number 20:** Discarding any packet from or to `127.0.0.0/8` (broadcast).
- **Rule Number 30:** Discarding any packet from `224.0.0.0/3` (broadcast).
- **Rule Number 40:** Discarding TCP packets to `224.0.0.0/3` (broadcast).
- **Rule Numbers 100–64000:** User-defined port-specific filters.
- **Rule Number 63200:** Denying access for ICMP echo reply. Created when “Deny ICMP echo reply” is selected in the Advanced pane of the Configure Firewall window.
- **Rule Number 63300:** Denying access for IGMP. Created when “Deny IGMP” is selected in the Advanced pane of the Configure Firewall window.
- **Rule Number 63400:** Allowing any TCP or UDP packet to access port 111 (needed by NetInfo). Created when a shared NetInfo domain is found on the server.
- **Rule Number 63500:** Allowing user-specified TCP and UDP packets to access ports needed for NetInfo shared domains.
- **Rule Numbers 64000–65000:** User-defined filters for Default.

**Reviewing IP Filter Rules:**

- Use the Terminal application to submit the `ipfw show` command to review the rules currently defined for your server. The `show` command displays four columns of information:
  - **Column 1:** The rule number. The lower the number, the higher the priority of the rule.
  - **Column 2:** The number of times the filter has been applied since it was defined.
  - **Column 3:** The number of bytes to which the filter has been applied.
  - **Column 4:** A description of the rule.

**Creating IP Filter Rules:**

- Use the `ipfw add` command to create new rules. For example, to define a rule that prevents TCP packets from a client with IP address `10.123.123.123` from accessing port 80 of the system with IP address `17.123.123.123`:
  ```sh
  ipfw add 200 deny tcp from 10.123.123.123 to 17.123.123.123 80
  ```

**Deleting IP Filter Rules:**

- Use the `ipfw delete` command to delete a rule. For example, to delete rule 200:
  ```sh
  ipfw delete 200
  ```

For more information, consult the man pages for `ipfw`.
