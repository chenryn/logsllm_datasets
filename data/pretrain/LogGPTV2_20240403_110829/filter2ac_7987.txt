**ATT&CK ID:** T1070.003  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Clear Command History

In addition to clearing system logs, adversaries may also erase the command history of a compromised account to conceal their activities during an intrusion. Many command interpreters maintain a record of the commands entered by users in their terminal, allowing them to review and re-execute previous actions. By clearing this history, attackers can make it more difficult for investigators to trace their steps and understand the nature of the compromise.
