ABSTRACT
We present a new ad fraud mechanism that enables publishers to
increase their ad revenue by deceiving the ad exchange and adver-
tisers to target higher paying ads at users visiting the publisher’s
site. Our attack is based on polluting users’ online interest proﬁle
by issuing requests to content not explicitly requested by the user,
such that it inﬂuences the ad selection process. We address sev-
eral challenges involved in setting up the attack for the two most
commonly used ad targeting mechanisms – re-marketing and be-
havioral targeting. We validate the attack for one of the largest ad
exchanges and empirically measure the monetary gains of the pub-
lisher by emulating the attack using web traces of 619 real users.
Our results show that the attack is effective in biasing ads towards
the desired higher-paying advertisers; the polluter can inﬂuence up
to 74% and 12% of the total ad impressions for re-marketing and
behavioral pollution, respectively. The attack is robust to diverse
browsing patterns and online interests of users. Finally, the attack
is lucrative and on average the attack can increase revenue of fraud-
ulent publishers by as much as 33%.

users. Recently, there has been a concerted effort to increase the
relevance of ads targeted at users by tailoring the ads to their stated
or inferred interests. Studies have shown that ads targeted based
on a user’s online interests have a 40% higher chance in leading to
a ﬁnancial conversion over non-targeted ads [24]. Consequently,
the average price online advertisers and marketers pay for these
targeted ads is 2.6 times higher than non-targeted ads [15].
The revenue model for online targeted advertising can be de-
scribed by the function of three primary entities: advertisers, pub-
lishers and ad exchange platforms. Ad exchange platforms (e.g.,
DoubleClick) facilitate the buying and selling of ads between the
advertiser and publisher. Publishers register their website with the
ad exchange and host ad slots. Advertisers set up campaigns by de-
scribing their target audience, e.g., specifying user demographics
and interests, along with a maximum cost they are willing to pay
for ad impressions or clicks made by their target audience. The ad
exchange runs an online auction based on the bid values received
from all the competing advertisers, and delivers the winning ad to
the user visiting the publisher page. The revenue generated from
this transaction is shared between the publisher (which typically
receives 68% [3] of the revenue) and the ad exchange.
As is evident from the above description, there are two main
factors that impact the publisher’s revenue. The ﬁrst is the number
of users visiting the publisher webpage which in turn impacts the
number of ad impressions or clicks served by the publisher. The
second is the cost that advertisers are willing to pay to have their
ads targeted at users visiting the publisher page.
In this paper we present a new ad fraud mechanism that enables
publishers to increase their ad revenue by exploiting the role played
by the user’s online interest proﬁle in the ad selection process. Our
attack exploits the fact that advertisers mainly set up campaigns
to target users with speciﬁc online interests and are willing to pay
higher for such users. Since the user’s interest proﬁle is inferred
based on the webpages a user visits, it is vulnerable to exploits that
use Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) [18], clickjacking [27] or
cross-site scripting (XSS) [32] that can pollute users’ proﬁles by
generating camouﬂaged requests to webpages not explicitly visited
by them. A fraudulent publisher can use these exploits to pollute
the proﬁles of users visiting the publisher’s website to mislead ad-
vertisers and the ad exchange to deliver more lucrative ads to these
users, and thereby increase the publisher’s ad revenue.
While the above described attack seems intuitive, it is not trivial
to design and launch the attack such that it is practical, effective,
and lucrative. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the ﬁrst
to design and successfully deploy a pollution attack on the existing
targeted advertising ecosystem. Achieving this requires addressing
the following challenges which also form the main contributions of
our work. First, the attack should not require any explicit cooper-
ation from the ad exchange or advertisers, and should be effective
for the two commonly used ad targeting mechanisms – behavioral
targeting and re-marketing. Second, polluting user proﬁles should
be effective even without explicit knowledge about external fac-
tors that impact ad revenue (campaign budgets, bid costs, publisher
preferences and ad inventory, etc.). Third, it should be feasible to
load the pollution content in a camouﬂaged manner such that it is
not discernible by the users while deceiving the ad exchange and
advertisers. Finally, the polluted user proﬁle should result in bias-
ing the ads targeted at the user towards the intended higher-paying
advertisers.
To address the above described challenges, we set up and vali-
date the attack against one of the largest ad exchanges, DoubleClick,
and study the monetary value of the attack for live publisher web-
pages. Instead of polluting live trafﬁc, we emulate user trafﬁc to the
publisher websites by replaying web traces collected from 619 real
users from 264 distinct IP addresses and recording all ads delivered
to these emulated users. This setup enables an end-to-end char-
acterization of the different aspects of the attack under controlled
settings that is otherwise not feasible. Our results show that the at-
tack is successful and effective in deceiving DoubleClick to deliver
higher-paying ads on the fraudulent publisher’s website. Using our
attack, the polluter can inﬂuence up to 74% and 12% of the total
ad impressions for re-marketing and behavioral pollution, respec-
tively. Finally, we show that the attack is lucrative, enabling the
fraudulent publishers to increase their ad revenue on average by
33%.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. We provide an
overview of the ad targeting mechanisms in Section 2. In Section 3
we detail the proﬁle pollution attack and discuss its deployment
challenges. Section 4 describe the setup we use to validate the at-
tack in a real-world deployment, and Section 5 details the valida-
tion results. We quantify the expected increase in revenue obtained
from deploying the attack on real websites in Section 6. In Sec-
tion 7 we discuss potential countermeasures that can help mitigate
the attack. Finally, we discuss related work in Section 8 and con-
clude in Section 9.
2. AD TARGETING AND USER PROFILES
In this section we describe the ad targeting mechanisms available
to advertisers [2] and discuss the critical role played by a user’s
online interest proﬁle in the existing ad ecosystem.
2.1 Ad Targeting Mechanisms
Contextual Targeting. Contextual targeting involves matching the
ad with the context of the page that it is displayed on (and ignores
the visitor interest proﬁle). The targeting is implicit and the user’s
online interests are largely ignored: a car insurance company will
place ads on auto-related sites because it is assumed that visitors to
the site are likely to own a car (or want to) and will need insurance.
Re-Marketing. Re-marketing is used by advertisers to target users
who, in the past, have indicated a very speciﬁc interest in a par-
ticular product. For example, consider a user who visits a car in-
surance website, clicks on a link to get a quote, but leaves with-
out buying the insurance offered. The insurance company (via the
ad exchange) can then target this user with re-marketing ads, e.g.,
showing insurance discounts. These ads will be delivered to the
user on other websites, which may be completely unrelated to cars
or insurance, to lure the user back to ﬁnish the purchase. Here, the
advertiser targets a user by exploiting a very speciﬁc signal.
Behavioral Targeting. Behavioral targeting is used by advertis-
ers that target users who have shown an interest in some categories
(e.g., cars or college football). This mechanism goes beyond the
“single domain” aspect of re-marketing, and selects ads that might
relate to the user’s online interests as observed from her brows-
ing patterns. This form of targeting often results in ads that may
be unrelated with the page being viewed [29]. For example, with
behavioral targeting, a user might be targeted with car insurance
related ads (potentially from a company she did not visit online) on
a website about Food & Nutrition simply because she visited mul-
tiple different car insurance related websites, and the ad exchange
proﬁled her to be interested in car insurance.
2.2 User Proﬁles and Targeted Ads
Behavioral targeting and re-marketing make explicit use of the
user’s online interests that are proﬁled by the ad exchange and
other third party trackers. This is achieved by installing third party
JavaScript tracking code provided by the ad exchange on websites
that users’ browse. The tracking code extracts details about the
page (e.g., exact URL, meta tags about keywords, description,
etc. [35]) and transmits this along with the user’s cookie identi-
ﬁer. This information, along with other information that the ad
exchange has about the website, is used to proﬁle the user’s inter-
ests and are offered to advertisers as targeting options. A user’s
interest proﬁle for behavioral targeting is represented as a set of se-
mantic categories, structured as a hierarchy (e.g., Movies→Action
Films→Superhero ﬁlms). For re-marketing, the ad exchange sim-
ply maintains a list of users (cookie IDs) that visit a speciﬁc page
on the advertiser’s website.
As is evident, the user’s interest proﬁle forms an integral com-
ponent of the ad selection process. Advertisers assign a monetary
value using cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-mille (CPM) directly
to the user’s online interests and are willing to pay up to 2.6 times
higher to target ads at users with a desired proﬁle [15]. Moreover,
as we show in Section 5, although a user may have online interests
accumulated over a long time period, short term browsing activity
can signiﬁcantly impact the user’s proﬁle and consequently change
the type of ads that a user receives. Our attack exploits this crit-
ical aspect and enables publishers to pollute user proﬁles towards
ad categories that generate higher revenue. In the following sec-
tion we provide an overview of the attack and present techniques
for proﬁle pollution that are speciﬁc to the ad ecosystem and the
commonly used ad targeting mechanisms.
3. PROFILE POLLUTION ATTACK
The proﬁle pollution attack (which we also refer to as a fraud
mechanism) introduces a new entity in the ad ecosystem that we
call proﬁle polluter. Figure 1 shows the interaction of the proﬁle
polluter with the rest of the ad ecosystem (dashed lines). Speciﬁ-
cally, the primary steps involved in a successful attack are:
1. The proﬁle polluter identiﬁes and downloads content in order
to pollute user proﬁles.
2. A user visits the polluter page (which can be hosted at the pub-
lisher’s website) and pollution content is loaded ﬁrst in a cam-
ouﬂaged manner. (steps 1 and 1a in the ﬁgure).
3. This signals the ad exchange of a legitimate browsing event by
the user, and the user’s proﬁle is impacted (step 1b).
4. When the user navigates to another page on the publisher’s web-
site, the ad exchange is deceived in using this modiﬁed proﬁle
in soliciting bids for ads (steps 2-5).
Figure 1: An overview of the proﬁle pollution attack
5. The publisher’s revenue increases if the winning ad is from an
advertiser that bids higher to target the polluted user (step 6).
The attack focuses on polluting users to inﬂuence behavioral tar-
geting and re-marketing ad campaigns, as they explicitly make use
of the user’s online interest proﬁle.
In order to simplify the de-
scription, we assume that the publisher also plays the role of the
proﬁle polluter. The readers should note under this assumption the
attack could only impact ads of user’s next visit, as the website con-
tent and pollution content are loaded by browser in parallel in each
visit.
3.1
Identifying Pollution Content
There are two key requirements for selecting pollution content.
First, content selected for pollution should alter the user proﬁles
towards advertisers that bid higher to target users. Since informa-
tion about advertising budgets and bid prices is typically not shared
externally, the polluter can resort to aggregate revenue reports gen-
erated by the ad exchange. For example, data published by Dou-
bleClick [26] lists the top three display advertising categories that
generate the highest CPM as Health, Business and Job & Educa-
tion. The proﬁle polluter selects websites for the two pollution
mechanisms from these categories. More importantly, the differ-
ent categories and their associated revenue estimates enables the
attacker to control the monetization of the attack and potentially
go undetected by the ad exchange by not raising any anomalous
revenue alerts. Second, the selected content needs to contain the
tracking cookies and code used by the ad exchange to track and
proﬁle users. This deceives the ad exchange that the pollution con-
tent is a regular browsing activity, and consequently successfully
alter the user’s proﬁle.
Pollution Content for Re-Marketing. A re-marketing campaign
is set up by integrating a few lines of JavaScript code, i.e., the re-
marketing script, which is provided by the ad exchange, in the ad-
vertiser’s website. The JavaScript code encodes the unique iden-
tiﬁer of the advertiser and the associated re-marketing campaign.
When a user visits the re-marketing enabled advertiser website,
these identiﬁers along with the user’s ad exchange cookie are trans-
