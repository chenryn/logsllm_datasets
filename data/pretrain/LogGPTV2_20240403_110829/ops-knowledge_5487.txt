User: I have some very large C files, having lots of functions. I need to trace the execution path at run time. There is no way I can trace it through debugging as its a hypervisor code currently running over qemu and doing a lot of binary translations.
Can anyone point me to some script in Perl or Python which can add a printf at the starting of all functions and the text could be something like "I am in < function name >"?
Assistant: Just pass -finstrument-functions to gcc when compiling. See the gcc(1) man page for details.
