User: I have a simple script I wrote, and when trying to run it (F5) , I get this msg:

================== RESTART: C:\Users\***\Desktop\tst.py ==================

I restarted the shell, reopened the script, but still, the same msg appears.
I use python 3.5.1 and I tried to simplify the script as much as possible, but I still get this result. Now my script is only one line with a simple print(1) command and I still get this msg.
Was there something wrong with the shell installation?
Assistant: You may have made the same mistake as me and ran a program and then you wonder why RESTART  is all that shows up.  My program was working perfectly I just did not print anything or ask for any input so it ran and was done with the program and nothing showed up.
