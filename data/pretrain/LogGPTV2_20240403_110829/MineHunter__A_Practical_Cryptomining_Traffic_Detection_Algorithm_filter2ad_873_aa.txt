ABSTRACT
With the development of cryptocurrencies’ market, the problem of
cryptojacking, which is an unauthorized control of someone else’s
computer to mine cryptocurrency, has been more and more serious.
Existing cryptojacking detection methods require to install anti-
virus software on the host or load plug-in in the browser, which
are difficult to deploy on enterprise or campus networks with a
large number of hosts and servers. To bridge the gap, we propose
MineHunter, a practical cryptomining traffic detection algorithm
based on time series tracking. Instead of being deployed at the hosts,
MineHunter detects the cryptomining traffic at the entrance of en-
terprise or campus networks. Minehunter has taken into account
the challenges faced by the actual deployment environment, in-
cluding extremely unbalanced datasets, controllable alarms, traffic
confusion, and efficiency. The accurate network-level detection is
achieved by analyzing the network traffic characteristics of cryp-
tomining and investigating the association between the network
flow sequence of cryptomining and the block creation sequence
of cryptocurrency. We evaluate our algorithm at the entrance of a
large office building in a campus network for a month. The total
volumes exceed 28 TeraBytes. Our experimental results show that
MineHunter can achieve precision of 97.0% and recall of 99.7%.

1 INTRODUCTION
Due to the anonymity of cryptocurrencies’ transactions, cryptocur-
rencies have been widely used in the dark web [26]. Lee et al. studied
more than 27 million dark webpages and found that the monetary
volume of cryptocurrency was around 180 million USD [19]. Cryp-
tomining is a process in which transactions for various forms of
cryptocurrency are verified and added to the blockchain digital
ledger [33]. Furthermore, cryptojacking, the unauthorized use of
someone else’s computer for cryptomining, has become a popular
attack similar to ransomware since 2018 [23]. At present, there are
mainly two types of cryptojacking. One is that adversaries compro-
mise popular webservers and embed malicious mining codes in the
websites [24][31]. When users browse the websites, they will help
the adversaries to mine cryptocurrencies. The detection method for
this kind of cryptojacking is commonly to install a plug-in in the
user’s browser, which analyzes the JavaScript code in the website
and the usage of the computing resources [18][3]. However, this
method requires the cooperation of users and browser vendors,
and it is difficult to deploy on a large scale environment. The other
is that adversaries control the users’ computers through malware,
making them bots for cryptomining [17]. The detecting solution
for this kind of cryptojacking is similar to the detection method of
malware, mainly by deploying anti-virus software on the host [11].
But with the rapid development of cryptojacking, the compromised
hosts are not only manifested by general computers, but also in-
clude all the devices with computing power, such as tablets, mobile
phones, smart devices, in which the anti-virus software is difficult
to deploy effectively [14]. Moreover, the detection performance of
this method generally depends on malware detection capabilities
of anti-virus software. Only a small number of known malware

can be detected, and it is challenging to detect a large number of
unknown and variant malware [16].
To overcome these shortcomings of the existing detection meth-
ods, we propose MineHunter, a practical cryptomining traffic detec-
tion algorithm based on time series tracking. Instead of deploying
at the hosts, MineHunter detects the cryptomining traffic at the
entrance of enterprise or campus networks by traffic analyzing
method, thus it can avoid large overhead. Similar to the network
intrusion detection system, the detection algorithm obtains input
traffic by port mirroring or optical fiber splitting and does not
require the host to deploy any related software, which is more con-
venient to deploy in the actual network. In addition, the detection
algorithm can detect both kinds of cryptojacking, embedding min-
ing JavaScript codes in the website or utilizing the mining malware,
which both have a similar pattern in network communication.
Below we summarize the challenges faced by MineHunter.
Challenge 1: Extremely unbalanced datasets. Data imbal-
ance is the core challenge in the field of traffic anomaly detection.
Although many network traffic anomaly detection algorithms based
on machine learning have been proposed over the years, these
algorithms usually require a relatively balanced dataset [39][21].
However, in the actual network environment, the scale of crypto-
mining traffic is tiny. To solve this challenge, we investigate the
association between the network flow sequence of cryptomining
and the block creation sequence of cryptocurrency. Using these
characteristics, we propose a practical time series anomaly detec-
tion algorithm through long-term tracking of network behavior to
distinguish a minimal amount of cryptomining traffic from enor-
mous benign traffic. The evaluation results show that our algorithm
can achieve 97.0% precision and 99.7% recall in an average data
ratio of 1 : 200, 000 imbalanced datasets.
Challenge 2: Uncontrollable number of alarms. Traditional
network traffic anomaly detection algorithms usually have the
problem of high false positives and cannot guarantee the specific
number of false positives. In addition, traffic volumes in the actual
network environment are relatively large. For example, we measure
a network with 4096 active addresses, which generates an average
of 4.3 million flows per day. Therefore, even with a false alarm rate
of 0.1%, 4, 300 false alarms will be generated every day, which is
unacceptable to network administrators. Our anomaly detection
algorithm not only judges whether the flow is a cryptomining
flow but also ranks the similarity. Network administrators can
process the top n from the ranked table according to their processing
capabilities.
Challenge 3: Traffic confusion. With the development of traf-
fic detection algorithms and countermeasure technologies, the abil-
ity of adversaries to obfuscate traffic continues to increase. Common
obfuscation techniques include adding proxy, load encryption, port
replacement, and packet padding. In order to solve the challenges
of these countermeasures, our detection algorithm only uses the
timestamp of packet and the number of packets in a flow. In the
following part, we will introduce that the features we use are based
on the working principle of cryptomining, which is difficult to be
confused. We evaluate the countermeasures in Section 4.5.
Challenge 4: Online detection. Due to the rapid growth of
network bandwidth in the actual network environment, there are
strict restrictions on the computational complexity of the detection
algorithm. In order to meet the real-time requirements in the actual
network environment, we only use two simple features, the times-
tamp of packet and the number of packets in a flow, and propose
a linear complexity anomaly detection algorithm. Our evaluation
experiments show that on an ordinary server, the processing power
of our algorithm can reach about 350, 000 packets per second. Ac-
cording to the average packet length of 1000 bytes, the algorithm
on an ordinary server can afford a 2.8 Gbit/s link. Moreover, our
algorithm detects each flow separately. Therefore, it can be easily
parallelized to improve the overall processing performance of the
system.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• Unlike traditional traffic analysis, we not only analyze the
network traffic characteristics of cryptomining, but also as-
sociate the flow sequence of cryptomining with the block
creation sequence of the cryptocurrency.
• we propose a cryptomining traffic detection algorithm based
on time series tracking, which first tries to solve all the above
four core challenges.
• We conduct a large-scale evaluation experiment in a campus
network environment within one month. The total number
of packets in the network traffic exceeds 30 billion. The
experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve
97.0% precision and 99.7% recall on the extremely unbalanced
dataset outperforming the state-of-art approach based on
machine learning.
