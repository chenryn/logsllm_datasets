Hello
I tried to index an double array {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and let ES automatically
detect the type. Then I wrote a plugin to get the value as follows
ScriptDocValues docHashValues = (ScriptDocValues) doc().get("array");  
final List tmp = ((ScriptDocValues.Doubles) docHashValues).getValues();
However I found the tmp size is always <= 4. Is this a bug or there are some
limitations for array size in ES? Thanks!
