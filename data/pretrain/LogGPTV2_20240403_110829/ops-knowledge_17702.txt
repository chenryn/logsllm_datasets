User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题I am trying to setup phpMyAdmin to use with a remote MySQL databases on Scientific Linux release 6.2 I am trying to setup phpMyAdmin to use with a remote MySQL databases on Scientific Linux release 6.2.

If I use the mysql command line to connect to the remote database it works great but if I use mysqladmin I am getting "#2002 Cannot log in to the MySQL server".

I have found if I do a:

setenforce 0

It will work from myphpadmin to my remote database but once I reboot or set Scientific Linux setenforce back to one it stops working again..

I know setenforce 0 is not the right thing to do but can someone please give me details steps on how to get this working the right way... thanks  I am new to Scientific Linux  and been having some issues.. thanks

Assistant: All I had to do was setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1 and now its working
