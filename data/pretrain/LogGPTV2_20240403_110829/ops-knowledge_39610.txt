User: I'm using Python (winappdbg) to monitor a process (the main feature is to catch the exceptions).
But I would like also to detect infinite loops.
Do you know a way to do that with Python?
With or without winappdbg ...
Assistant: The only way to detect an infinite loop is to include in the loop itself a test for those conditions that would bring it to never end.
For example: if your loop is supposed to make a variable decrease until it reaches zero (var == 0 would be the exit condition), you should include a test for what I would call "proper working condition". In this example this would be: var < var_of_previous_iteration.
Another (less deterministic) way to catch infinite loops could be to include a timer and trigger an exception if the loop last longer than a given time limit [this is a hugly hack though, as execution speed could be affected for example by the system being busy doing something else].
HTH!
