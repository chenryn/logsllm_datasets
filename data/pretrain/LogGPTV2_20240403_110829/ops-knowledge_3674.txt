### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:46 to 18:07:51 on October 18th, documents multiple issues related to contacting the Resource Manager (RM) and renewing a lease for the DFS client. The key points are:

1. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues:**
   - At 18:07:46, 18:07:48, 18:07:50, and 18:07:51, the `RMCommunicator Allocator` component encounters errors while attempting to contact the RM.
   - The system logs an `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM` each time, indicating a failure in communication.
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component detects an address change for the RM, changing from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system retries connecting to the RM server at `msra-sa-41:8030` with a retry policy of up to 10 attempts, each with a 1-second delay.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures:**
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component, identified as `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`, fails to renew the lease for `[DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1]` multiple times.
   - The lease renewal failures occur at 18:07:46, 18:07:47, 18:07:48, 18:07:49, 18:07:50, and 18:07:51, with increasing durations (168, 169, 171, 172, 173, and 174 seconds, respectively).
   - The system logs a warning each time, stating that it will retry shortly.
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component also detects an address change for the lease renewer, changing from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.

### Key Observations
- **Address Changes:** Both the RM and the lease renewer experience address changes, which may be contributing to the communication and lease renewal issues.
- **Retry Attempts:** The system is configured to retry both the RM connection and the lease renewal, but these retries are not successful within the logged timeframe.
- **Increasing Failure Durations:** The duration of the lease renewal failures increases over time, suggesting a potential issue with the network or the Hadoop cluster's stability.

### Recommendations
- **Investigate Address Changes:** Determine the cause of the address changes and ensure that the correct addresses are being used.
- **Network and Cluster Health Check:** Perform a health check on the network and the Hadoop cluster to identify any underlying issues.
- **Increase Retry Intervals:** Consider increasing the retry intervals or the number of retries to allow more time for the system to recover from transient issues.

By addressing these issues, the system should be able to successfully contact the RM and renew the lease for the DFS client.
