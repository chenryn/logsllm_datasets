# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Simply, I myself am not a fan of the default windows start menu. I only ever
use it for searching for apps or files so PowerToys Run seemed like a good
replacement. It's fast and has less clutter HOWEVER it don't have the option
to map the WinKey by itself to replace the start menu. I've had to resort to
remapping the WinKey to act as a different key and use AutoHotkey to launch
PowerToys Run when it's pressed. This has it's issues though...
# Proposed technical implementation details
Simply in the shortcuts box, allow the WinKey to trigger it all on it's own.
Make it not trigger the normal start menu when the WinKey is pressed.
