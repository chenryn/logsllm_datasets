Opening this up for a discussion, basically what i'd like to see is an API to
set the background of the browser-window surrounding the web contents. When
the user is resizing the window this shows up before the web contents fills
the available space - if you are developing a dark application then this white
border looks particularly bad.
For example I noticed that Spotify is able to achieve this by using a fill
color that matches the rest of the app whilst the UI resizes.
