I have just spent quite some time debugging my code because the absolute value
function might return negative values. See the following working example:
    import numpy as np
    np.array([-32768,-3000],dtype=np.dtype('int16'))
    np.abs(_)
While the second value is converted to +3000 as expected, the second value is
left untouched. I understand that +32768 is out of range for this datatype but
I am interested whether returning -32768 is a concious design choice as I was
expecting positive values from this function no matter what.
