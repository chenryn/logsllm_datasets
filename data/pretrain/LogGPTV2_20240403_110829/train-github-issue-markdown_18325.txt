### System Information
- Playwright Version: 1.32.2
- Operating System: Linux
- Browsers: All (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Additional Information: N/A

### Source Code
```bash
docker-compose up --exit-code-from e2e --build e2e
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run a test in a container using CircleCI.

### Expected Behavior
Delaying the exit code until after the report generation might resolve the issue.

### Actual Behavior
The `--exit-code-from` flag is necessary to show step failures. However, this flag causes the container to terminate immediately once the test is complete and Playwright returns an exit code of 1. This results in the container being terminated before the report is generated.

### Detailed Explanation
To display step failures, we need to use the `--exit-code-from` flag. Unfortunately, this flag causes the container to terminate as soon as the test completes and Playwright returns an exit code of 1. As a result, the container is terminated before the report can be generated. Delaying the exit code until after the report generation could potentially solve this issue.
