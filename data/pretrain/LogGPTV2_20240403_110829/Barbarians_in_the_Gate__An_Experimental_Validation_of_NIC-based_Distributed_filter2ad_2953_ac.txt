# Denial-of-Service Tolerance and Performance Analysis of NIC-Based Distributed Firewalls

## Introduction
This paper evaluates the performance and denial-of-service (DoS) tolerance of two NIC-based distributed firewalls: the Embedded Firewall (EFW) and the Autonomic Distributed Firewall (ADF). The primary objective is to determine if these devices are susceptible to packet flood DoS attacks and to measure their performance characteristics under various conditions.

## Experimental Setup and Results

### Packet Flood Tolerance
The minimum flood rate required to cause a DoS attack as the rule-set depth increases is illustrated in Figure 3. The results show that:
- ADF (Deny): 42,000 packets per second
- EFW (Allow): 40,000 packets per second
- ADF (Allow): 35,000 packets per second

As the number of rules in the rule-set increases, the minimum required flood rate decreases. For a full rule-set (64 rules), the minimum required flood rate was only 4,500 packets per second when the attack packets were allowed by the firewall.

### HTTP Performance
Three key metrics were measured using the `http_load` tool: throughput, connection latency, and response latency.
- **Throughput**: Measured in page fetches per second, indicating the number of users the server can support simultaneously.
- **Connection Latency**: Time required to complete the 3-way TCP handshake.
- **Response Latency**: Time required to complete the entire transfer of the requested web page.

Figure 1 shows that the ADF offered lower performance than a standard NIC in all configurations. As the action rule was placed deeper in the rule-set, web-server throughput decreased, with the ADF responsible for a 41% performance decrease compared to a standard NIC at its worst.

### Latency Metrics
Both connection time and response time increased as the rule-set size increased, but the additional delay was not excessive. For Internet service, which typically has a latency greater than 50 ms, the additional latency would hardly be noticeable. However, it might be noticeable for local area networks and problematic for the most demanding real-time applications.

### Virtual Private Groups (VPGs)
The use of VPGs significantly affected HTTP performance. The addition of a VPG dropped performance, but the insertion of other non-matching VPG rules did not alter the performance. This is similar to the effect seen in available bandwidth experiments.

## Analysis of Results

### Network Speed and Rule-Set Size
The experimental results indicate that neither the EFW nor the ADF performs well enough to be used safely on a 100 Mbps network. On a 10 Mbps network, the EFW/ADF can be safely used only if the rule-set is kept to under eight rules. Providing a useful rule-set in under eight rules is challenging. For example, protecting an Oracle database server requires at least 31 rules, as recommended by 3COM [1].

### Performance Bottleneck
Without access to the source code and hardware schematics, it is only possible to make conjectures about the exact implementation. Further discussion of our results is available in [11].

## Conclusion

In this paper, we validated the performance and DoS tolerance of two NIC-based distributed firewalls, the EFW and ADF. Our results indicated that both devices can easily be flooded, preventing valid traffic from being processed. An attacker only needs to generate a flood of 42,000 packets per second, a rate easily achievable on a 100 Mbps network.

Despite the vulnerabilities, the benefits provided by a NIC-based distributed firewall outweigh the drawbacks. As part of a strong defense-in-depth strategy, distributed firewall NICs provide defense at the network edge. If deployed with the above limitations in mind, the network administrator can safely utilize the EFW and ADF. We hope this research encourages the development of new embedded firewall devices with sufficient tolerance to simple packet flood attacks.
