anticipated, if the rule allowing HTTP trafﬁc was placed deep
in the rule-set, performance decreased.
Three measurements are provided by http load: through-
put, connection latency, and response latency. The throughput
of the server, measured in page fetches per second, provides
a rough estimate of how many users the server can support
simultaneously. Connection latency is the time required to
complete the 3-way TCP handshake. Response latency is the
time required to complete the entire transfer of the requested
web page.
Figure 1 shows that the ADF offered lower performance
than a standard NIC in all conﬁgurations. As the action rule
was placed deeper in the rule-set, web-server throughput was
reduced. At its worst, the ADF was responsible for a 41%
performance decrease compared to a standard NIC.
The connection time and response time are latency metrics
that are important for interactive applications. Figure 1 shows
that both latency measures increased as the rule-set size in-
creased, but the additional delay was not excessive. Any addi-
tional latency would hardly be noticeable for Internet service,
which typically has a latency greater than 50 ms. The addi-
tional latency might be noticeable for local area networks, but
would only be problematic for the most demanding real-time
applications.
Use of VPGs also signiﬁcantly affected HTTP perfor-
mance. Figure 1 shows that the addition of a VPG dropped
performance signiﬁcantly, but that the insertion of other non-
matching VPG rules did not alter the performance. This is
similar to the effect seen for the available bandwidth experi-
ments.
4.5. Analysis of results
The experimental results show that neither the EFW nor
the ADF performs well enough to be used safely on a 100
Mbps network. In our opinion this is problematic for a couple
of reasons. First, given the proliferation of 100 Mbps net-
works, it is unlikely that the devices will be used only on 10
Mbps networks. Second, we have found no publicly available
EFW documentation that provides performance data or vul-
nerability warnings for packet ﬂood attacks. Finally, due to
the cost of the devices and the nature of their implementation,
we believe that they will most likely be used in environments
where security is of the utmost importance. In those environ-
ments, it is important to be aware of all vulnerabilities so that
proper mitigations can be implemented.
Even on a 10 Mbps network, the EFW/ADF can be safely
used only if the rule-set is kept to under eight rules. In general
it would be very difﬁcult to provide a useful rule-set in under
eight rules. For example, to protect an Oracle database server,
3COM recommends a rule-set that requires at least 31 rules to
protect the appropriate ports [1].
If we had access to the source code and hardware schemat-
ics, it would have been possible to determine the exact reason
for the performance bottleneck. Unfortunately, without such
access, it is only possible to make conjectures about the exact
implementation used on either the EFW or the ADF. Further
discussion of our results is available in [11].
5. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented the validation of two NIC-
based distributed ﬁrewalls, the Embedded Firewall and the
Autonomic Distributed Firewall. Speciﬁcally, we were inter-
ested in determining if either of the devices are susceptible to
packet ﬂood denial-of-service attacks. Our results indicated
that both devices can easily be ﬂooded, preventing valid traf-
ﬁc from being processed.
Our experiments indicate that an attacker can easily over-
load the NIC with packets, even if the device is enforcing
the simplest “default allow” rule. An attacker only needs to
generate a ﬂood of 42 000 packets per second, a rate easily
achievable on a 100 Mbps network. As rules were added to
the rule-set we found the minimum ﬂood rate declined; for a
full rule-set (64 rules) with the attack packets being allowed
by the ﬁrewall, the minimum required ﬂood rate was only
4 500 packets per second. Because the ﬂood packets in the
rule-set were blocked, some denial-of-service tolerance was
gained. However, the attacker only needs to spoof packets
with the right IP address and ports to have the packets pass
through the ﬁrewall.
In the process of determining the ﬂood tolerance, we have
also measured the performance characteristics of the ﬁre-
wall devices. Our performance tests measured the available

bandwidth of the EFW/ADF as a function of rule-set size.
We found that for rule-sets containing fewer than 20 rules
there was no signiﬁcant performance loss. However, with the
largest rule-set of 64 rules, the EFW was only able to operate
at 50 Mbps, half of full network speed. The ADF was only
able to provide around 33 Mbps throughput, likely the result
of a less efﬁcient packet ﬁltering algorithm, as both devices
are built on the same hardware platform.
Despite the EFW/ADF’s vulnerability to denial-of-service
attacks, we believe the beneﬁts provided by a NIC-based dis-
tributed ﬁrewall outweigh the drawbacks. As part of a strong
defense-in-depth strategy, distributed ﬁrewall NICs provide
defense at the network edge. If they are deployed with the
above limitations in mind,
the network administrator can
safely utilize the EFW and ADF. It is our hope that this re-
search encourages the development of new embedded ﬁrewall
devices that have sufﬁcient tolerance to simple packet ﬂood
attacks.
