Hello,

I am experiencing an issue with `Pkg.update()` in Julia. When I run the command, the update process starts but gets stuck when it reaches the `Compat` package. I then interrupt the process, and it rolls back the `ColorTypes` package (as shown below). The `Compat` package's documentation only mentions version 0.7.12, while the update is attempting to fetch version 0.7.13. This issue occurred in Julia version 4.3, and I have since upgraded to version 4.5, but the problem persists.

Could you please provide any suggestions on how to resolve or bypass this `Compat` issue?

Thank you.
