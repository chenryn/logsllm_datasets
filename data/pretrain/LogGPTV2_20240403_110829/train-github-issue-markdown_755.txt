Hi,  
When I run Pkg.update(), it starts the update but when it reaches Compat, it
does not move forward anymore. Then I interrupt and it "rolls bacl ColorType"
(see below; In Compat's link, it mentions only v 0.07.12. While the attempted
update is trying to fetch 0.07.13. ). This happened under v 4.3. I upgraded
the julia core to 4.5 and still face the same issue. Any idea how to fix this
or bypass this Compat issue?  
Thank
