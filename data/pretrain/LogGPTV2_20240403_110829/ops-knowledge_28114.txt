User: I have just installed Python 3.5.1 on my Mac (running the latest version of OSX). My system came with Python 2.7 installed. When I type IDLE at the Terminal prompt my system pulls up the original Python 2.7 rather than the newly installed Python 3.5. How do I get my system to default to Python 3.5.1 when I open the IDLE window from Terminal?
Assistant: By typing python, you are actually referring to a link.
You will find its location with $ which python. In my case it was /usr/local/bin/python. go there $open /usr/local/bin/ and just delete the original python, python-config and idle as they are
identical to the 2.7 files in the same folder.
Then duplicate the 3.5 files and rename them to what you just deleted.
This also changes the default link other editors like Sublime_ReplPython use and updates it therefore to the 3.5 Version. This was my major concern with the standard installation.
