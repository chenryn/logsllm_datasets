User: I have just written a python script to do some batch file operations. I was wondering how i could keep it in some common path like rest of the command line utilities like cd, ls, grep etc.
What i expect is something like this to be done from any directory -
$ script.py arg1 arg2
Assistant: Add the directory it is stored in to your PATH variable? From your prompt, I'm guessing you're using an sh-like shell and from your tags, I'm further assuming OS X. Go into your .bashrc and make the necessary changes.
