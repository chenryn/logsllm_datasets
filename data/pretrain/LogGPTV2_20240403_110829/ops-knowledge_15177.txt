User: How to build a container image using Dockerfile? Please give a concrete example and explain what each instruction does.
Assistant: simple example is provided below to create a web server including nginx and PHP based on Ubuntu 16.04. ``` FROM ubuntu:16.04 RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx php7.0-fpm COPY ./var/www/html EXPOSE 80 CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off; "] ``` - `FROM`: The base image for building the image, here is Ubuntu 16.04. - `RUN`: The command to run in the container, here it is used to update the system's packages and install nginx and PHP. - `COPY`: Copy the files in the current directory to the /var/www/html directory in the container. - `EXPOSE`: Declare the network port that the container listens to, here is port 80. - `CMD`: The default command executed after the container starts, here is to start nginx and run it as a daemon process. This Dockerfile will create a new image containing Ubuntu 16.04, nginx and PHP, and copy the files in the current directory to the /var/www/html directory in the container. Port 80 in this image will be monitored by the container and run nginx as a daemon at startup.
