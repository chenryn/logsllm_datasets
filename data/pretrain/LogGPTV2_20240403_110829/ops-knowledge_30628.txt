User: I have multiple recurring tasks scheduled to run several times per day to keep some different data stores in sync with one another. The settings for the 'Actions' tab are as follows:
Action: Start a Program
Program/script: C:\<path to script>.py
Add arguments: 
Start in: C:\<directory of script>
I can run the python files just fine if I use the command line and navigate to the file location and use python  or even just using python  without navigating. 
For some reason, the scripts just won't run with a scheduled task. I've checked all over and tried various things like making sure the user profile is set correctly and has all of the necessary privileges, which holds true. These scripts have been working for several weeks now with no problems, so something has changed that we aren't able to identify at this time.
Any suggestions?
Assistant: Have you tried using:
Action: Start a Program
Program/script: C:\<path to python.exe>\python.exe 
Add arguments:  C:\\<path to script>\\script.py
