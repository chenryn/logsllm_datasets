User: What is a CDN (Content Delivery Network)? How does it work?
Assistant: CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network architecture designed to improve the performance and reliability of web services such as websites and applications. CDN copies website content (such as pictures, audio, video, and applications) to multiple servers located around the world, and provides users with instant access through the nearest server, thereby reducing delay and network congestion. CDN not only improves the user's access speed, but also reduces the load on the source server, thereby improving the availability and reliability of global websites or applications. The working principle of CDN is to cache website content in distributed servers, and when a user sends a request, the copy stored in the nearest server is delivered to the user, thereby minimizing the transmission distance of the content and reducing the load on the source server. In addition, CDN can also use intelligent routing and load balancing technology to deliver content to end users through multiple paths, thereby avoiding single point of failure and network congestion. In short, CDN can improve the performance, reliability and availability of the website, improve user experience and customer satisfaction.
