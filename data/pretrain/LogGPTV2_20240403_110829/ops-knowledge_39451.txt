User: How would I go about writing a python script that shows how much bandwidth is being used and how much data is being transferred on a Windows 7 machine?
Assistant: What you want technically isn't a problem of the language you're using - how much data is being transferred on your network interfaces is something you need to get from your operating system or network device driver.  The way that you acquire these statistics will vary based on the OS, so that's what you need to nail down first.
