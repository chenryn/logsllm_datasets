ABSTRACT
Information security risk management is crucial for ensuring
long-term business success and thus numerous approaches
to implementing an adequate information security risk man-
agement strategy have been proposed. The subjective threat
probability determination is one of the main reasons for an i-
nadequate information security strategy endangering the or-
ganization in performing its mission. To address the problem
we developed an ontology- and Bayesian-based approach to
determine threat probabilities taking general information se-
curity knowledge and organization-speci(cid:12)c knowledge about
existing control implementations and attacker pro(cid:12)les into
account. The elaborated concepts enable risk managers to
comprehensibly quantify by the Bayesian threat probability
determination the current security status of their organiza-
tion.

INTRODUCTION
Regardless of which information security risk management
methodology is considered, it always includes the determi-
nation of threat probabilities to determine together with the
impact the actual risk of the considered asset [3]. The de-
termination of threat probabilities is predominantly based
on subjective perceptions and not an objective evaluation

[14, 2, 1], and some research has already been conducted on
determining threat probabilities in a structured and com-
prehensible way (cf.
[6, 21, 19, 17, 20, 24]). To address
the shortcomings of existing approaches (cf. Section 2), we
propose { based on the security ontology (cf. Section 3) {
a novel ontology- and Bayesian-based method to determine
threat probabilities. Based on our previous research (cf.
[13]), this paper provides (i) an enhanced Bayesian threat
probability determination calculation schema, (ii) a running
example to demonstrate the improved calculation schema,
(iii) a detailed discussion on how to automatically enrich
the Bayesian calculation schema with concrete information
security knowledge from the security ontology, and (iv) an
evaluation that shows how the results can be used in the
information security risk management domain. The follow-
ing section reviews related work regarding existing threat
probability determination approaches. Section 3 introduces
the security ontology, whereas the fourth and (cid:12)fth section
describe the proposed Bayesian network structure and its en-
richment with concrete information security domain knowl-
edge extracted from the security ontology. The paper con-
cludes with an evaluation in Section 6.
2. RELATED WORK
Dantu et al.
[6] use behavior based attack graphs to i-
dentify possible attacks on a network and to subsequently
estimate the risk level of business-crucial resources. This is
accomplished by a quantitative analysis of the attack graphs
and the derivation of speci(cid:12)c attack paths based on the at-
tacker’s nature. Each node in the attack path is described
by quantitative values such as skills, tenacity, and the cost-
s required to exploit the current node. Additionally, each
node holds a conditional probability table to describe the
probability of exploitation, based on various attacker pro-
(cid:12)les such as corporate insiders or hackers, taking also the
state of previous nodes into account (Bayesian network ap-
proach). While the approach by Dantu et al. is very useful
to model attack paths and the corresponding threat prob-
abilities in the (cid:12)eld of intentional network attacks, it lacks
the possibility of incorporating already installed controls.
Another drawback is the fact that it is not possible to mod-
el non-intentional threats such as natural or environmental
threats, where already implemented controls could signi(cid:12)-
cantly in(cid:13)uence the threat probability.
Neil et al.
[21] use Bayesian networks to model statisti-
cal loss distributions in (cid:12)nancial risk scenarios. The total
loss distribution is estimated by combining the loss frequen-
cy and severity distributions. The model is not restricted
344
to any family of probability distributions, yet for reason-
s of simplicity the authors recommend the usage of single
parameter distributions. The main shortcoming is the miss-
ing incorporation of existing control implementations into
the loss frequency determination. The missing factors are
implicitly given by the expert’s judgment.
Josang et al. [19] use the CCTA Risk Analysis and Man-
agement Methodology (CRAMM) in combination with Bayesian
networks to model the interactions of information security
threats and vulnerabilities.
’What-if’ studies enable by in-
ference the identi(cid:12)cation and prioritization of the most crit-
ical threats. Shortcomings of the approach: (1) it does not
describe how to derive the conditional probability table of
each node in the Bayesian network, (2) it does not describe
the calculation schema for the initial root node states, and
(3) the approach does not explicitly incorporate the e(cid:11)ec-
tiveness of existing control implementations, attacker pro-
(cid:12)les, and a priori probabilities.
Maglogiannis et al. [17] use subjective beliefs about threat
and vulnerability probabilities as input parameters for the
risk determination. The proposed approach takes the de-
gree of uncertainty into consideration and clearly indicates
it at the risk analysis results. Although, the proposed ap-
proach addresses the important issue of uncertainty, it does
not explain how to de(cid:12)ne, derive and combine the input
parameters for the probability calculation.
Mosleh et al. [20] present a Bayesian probabilistic method
for risk assessment. The authors bring forward the argumen-
t that the real rate of occurrence of a threat is not always
known in real life. Therefore, they show the uncertainty
by probability distributions. The authors do not explain
how the distribution parameters can be used in a real world
appliance. Based on statistical evidence they developed a
distribution of frequency for each threat, but unfortunately
no detailed data about those distributions are given. Anoth-
er shortcoming is the fact that the threat frequency is based
on more or less (cid:12)xed distributions, and no guidance is pro-
vided for incorporating in(cid:13)uencing factors such as already
implemented controls and/or the attacker’s constitution.
3. THE SECURITY ONTOLOGY
The security ontology [11] has been developed based on
the security relationship model described in the National
Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication
800-12 [22]. Figure 1 shows the high-level concepts and cor-
responding relations of the ontology. A threat gives rise to
follow-up threats, represents a potential danger to the orga-
nization’s assets and a(cid:11)ects speci(cid:12)c security attributes (e.g.
con(cid:12)dentiality, integrity, and/or availability) as soon as it
exploits a vulnerability in the form of a physical, techni-
cal, or administrative weakness. Additionally each threat is
described by potential threat origins (human or natural ori-
gin) and threat sources (accidental or deliberate source). For
each vulnerability a severity value and the asset on which the
vulnerability could be exploited is assigned. Controls have to
be implemented to mitigate an identi(cid:12)ed vulnerability and
to protect the respective assets. Each control is implement-
ed as asset concept, or as combinations thereof. Controls are
derived from and correspond to best-practice and informa-
tion security standard controls (e.g. the German IT Grund-
schutz Manual [5] and ISO/IEC 27001 [15]) to ensure the
incorporation of widely accepted knowledge. The controls
are modeled on a highly granular level and are thus reusable
345
for di(cid:11)erent standards. When implementing the controls,
compliance with various information security standards is
implicit. To enrich the knowledge model with concrete in-
formation security knowledge the German IT Grundschutz
Manual has been superimposed on the security ontology and
more than 500 information security concepts and 600 corre-
sponding formal axioms are integrated into the ontological
knowledge base. The coded ontology follows the OWL-DL
(W3C Web Ontology Language) standard and ensures that
the knowledge is represented in a standardized and formal
form. Visit http://sec.sba-research.org to browse the latest
security ontology version.
Figure 1: Security relationships
Since the security ontology provides detailed knowledge
about threat, vulnerability, and control dependencies, this
knowledge can be utilized to automatically build up the
Bayesian network for the threat probability determination.
Furthermore, the main strengths of using an ontology-based
approach are:
(i) Compared to existing information security standards
and best-practice guidelines the security ontology formally
describes the information security domain and is therefore
machine-readable. The information security knowledge con-
tained in the ontology is derived from existing standards and
best-practice guidelines.
(ii) The security ontology is designed as a central knowl-
edge repository. New facts such as newly discovered vul-
nerabilities can be easily integrated and reused at further
application, e.g. the Bayesian threat probability determina-
tion.
(iii) Once the organization has modeled its infrastructure
in the ontology it is able to use reasoning engines to rea-
son about the organization’s current security status. If new
knowledge facts such as vulnerabilities or controls are mod-
eled, reasoners show how they are a(cid:11)ecting the security sta-
tus of the organization.
(iv) As each control in the security ontology is related to
di(cid:11)erent information security standards the organization is
able to check its compliance to these standards. Compared
to existing approaches the organization is required to model
its infrastructure only once.
4. BAYESIAN NETWORK STRUCTURE
This section describes the variables used for the threat
probability determination. Since holistic databases about
threat occurrence rates are not available, relevant variables
for threat probability determination had to be derived man-
ually from existing best-practice guidelines (e.g. [7, 16, 23]).

(4) (a) in the case of deliberate threat sources, the vulner-
ability exploitation probability (P PVi ) is determined by the
e(cid:11)ectiveness of a potential attacker (AEVi ) which is again
determined by the motivation (AMVi ) and the capabilities
(ACVi ) of the attacker as stated in [16], (b) in the case
of accidental threat sources and/or natural threat origins,
the vulnerability exploitation probability (P PVi ) is deter-
mined by the a priori probability (APTi ) of the correspond-
ing threat (Ti) (see the right section of Figure 2). Figure 2
shows the proposed model for determining threat probabili-
ties by taking the aforementioned factors into consideration.
The result for each threat probability is represented as a dis-
tribution of the chosen rating scale (e.g. high, medium, and
low). While Table 1 gives a brief overview of the network re-
lationships, possible variable values, and potential variable
states, the following subsections explain the model by mov-
ing from the output to the input variables in more detail.
The probability calculation is progressively explicated and
each variable is complemented by a running example which
explains the calculation schema by moving from the output
to the input variables.
