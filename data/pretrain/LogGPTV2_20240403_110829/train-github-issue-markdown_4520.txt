### System Information
- **OpenCV Version**: 4.5.2 (Issue also present in 4.5.3 and 4.5.4)
- **Operating System/Platform**: Gentoo Linux 64-bit
- **Compiler**: GCC

### Detailed Description
Compilation of OpenCV 4.5.2 fails when using LAPACK 3.10.0. The error messages indicate that there are too few arguments being passed to several LAPACK functions in the `hal_internal.cpp` file.

#### Compilation Errors
The following errors occur during compilation:

1. **Error in `sposv_` function call:**
   ```cpp
   /build/opencv-cuda/src/opencv-4.5.2/modules/core/src/hal_internal.cpp:166:23: error: too few arguments to function ‘void sposv_(const char*, const int*, const int*, float*, const int*, float*, const int*, int*, size_t)’

2. **Error in `dposv_` function call:**
   ```cpp
   /build/opencv-cuda/src/opencv-4.5.2/modules/core/src/hal_internal.cpp:168:23: error: too few arguments to function ‘void dposv_(const char*, const int*, const int*, double*, const int*, double*, const int*, int*, size_t)’
     168 |                 dposv_(L, &m, &n, (double*)a, &lda, (double*)b, &m, &lapackStatus);

   ```

3. **Additional similar errors for `sposv_`, `dposv_`, `spotrf_`, `dpotrf_`, and `sgesdd_` functions.**

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Install LAPACK 3.10.0.
2. Attempt to compile OpenCV 4.5.2 with the installed LAPACK version.

### Issue Submission Checklist
- I am reporting an issue, not asking a question.
- I have checked the problem with documentation, FAQ, open issues, forum.opencv.org, Stack Overflow, etc., and have not found a solution.
- I have updated to the latest OpenCV version, and the issue still persists.
- There is reproducible code and related data files (videos, images, ONNX, etc.).
