Privacy in DSRC connected 
vehicles
Defcon 21 – August 3, 2013
whoami
• BSEE, digital communications
• Many years as a network engineer
• Santa Clara University Law student
• Research assistant providing technical expertise 
on privacy audits and reviews
• Contracted by auto consortium to review 
privacy of proposed vehicle to vehicle safety 
network
Standard Disclaimer
IANAL (Yet)
But if you know anyone looking for summer interns....
Non-Standard 
Disclaimer
A current NDA covers some of my work here (but not very much)
The focus will be on published information and standards.
What is This Project?
• DSRC: Dedicated Short Range Communications
• (Where “short” == 380m)
• Vehicle to Vehicle
• Vehicle to infrastructure
- Not having to wait for a light on an empty street 
again.
- Better trafﬁc planning for better cities and roadways.
Why is It being Developed?

How the safety features work
Non-trivial Impact on 
Auto Deaths
• World Health 
Organization estimates 
25% of vehicle deaths 
each year can be 
prevented.
• Fatigue and distracted 
driving accidents reduced.
• Blind Corners, fog and 
limited visibility accidents 
reduced.

Will This really Happen?
IT ALREADY IS
How Soon?
• Hardware is already being shipped. 
• Software issues still entirely in the air
• More is being done in software these days.
• The US Dept. of Transportation is 
considering mandating this for all new cars. 
(Decision to come later this year.)
• Has already deployed in trucks in Europe
What is DSRC
• Basic safety messages sent out 
every 1/10 seconds.
• All message carry a standard 
glob: values for pre-deﬁned 
vehicle trajectory and 
operational data.
• Cars process data and warn 
driver.
• Equipment integrated into 
vehicle

AfterMarket Installation

What DSRC is not
• CANbus
• OnStar (or any other 
remote service)
• (Direct) support for 
autonomous driving 
mechanisms.

Technical details
Radio protocol 
• 5.9GHz reserved in US and Europe
• Signaling standard: IEEE 802.11p / 
1609.4 / 1609.3 
• Channels reserved for speciﬁc 
functions
• Protocol does not require source 
address for vehicles
• Recommendations include using 
certiﬁcates
• Privacy challenges at each layer

Basic Safety Message
• Standard: SAE J2735
• ~50 ﬁxed data elements
• “only” interface to radio 
(on this channel/band)
Parameters for 
effectiveness
• Density
• Beneﬁt derived from other vehicles’ use
• Greater usage means greater 
effectiveness
• Conﬁdence
• Most messages must be trustworthy
Validity?
• All messages are 
cryptographically signed
• Signing certiﬁcates issued 
by central authority
• Issued based on system 
ﬁngerprint
• Revocation for 
“malfunctioning” equipment
• System should invalidate 
itself if internal checks fail

Certiﬁcates
• Limited time use to prevent tracking
• Reused?
• Periodically refreshed (and malefactors 
reported)
• How often?
Privacy?
 MAC Layer
• Changeable source (for vehicles) / no 
destination
• Unrouteable! (mostly)
• No signiﬁcant privacy concern as is.
• Any algorithm to make network routeable 
will make vehicles trackable.
BSM
• “Temporary” ID could become persistent with bad 
app
• Open source apps suggested for processing and 
acting on message data
Certiﬁcates
• Identity/Validity conﬂict
• Solution: constantly changing certiﬁcates
• Revocation by ﬁngerprint
• Issuing authority?
Fingerprints
• “No” correspondence 
between ﬁngerprint and 
car
• “hard coded” into device
• If revoked, entire unit 
must be replaced to 
function

Certiﬁcate Delivery
• Haven’t ﬁgured out how 
certiﬁcates are delivered to 
vehicle
• Proposals include cellular, 
wiﬁ, infrastructure links
• So many opportunities for 
failure
Worrisome Noise
• Manufacturers want to use this system for 
commercial apps
• Advertising and other “funding” schemes to pay for 
CA
• Fixed infrastructure potentially operated by data 
brokers
Problem: Law 
Enforcement
• What can they do with 
this?
• Correlate location, speed 
to independent 
identiﬁcation? (cameras?)

What you Can Do
• Hack the radios
•
Commercially available now
• Hack the protocols
• Become politically engaged
• Most decisions are not being made by elected 
ofﬁcials
• Help ﬁnd a way to fund the infrastructure 
without selling out!
