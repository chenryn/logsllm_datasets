#### 4.3.2 Observations and Analysis

We observed significant differences in the number of unsolicited calls and messages received by different honeycards. For example, soc1 and soc2 received a total of 317 and 83 unsolicited calls and SMS messages, respectively. Specifically, soc1 received 281 SMS messages and 36 calls, while soc2 received 30 SMS messages and 53 calls. Out of the 281 and 30 SMS messages received by soc1 and soc2, 278 (98.9%) and 22 (73.33%) were unsolicited, respectively.

Similar patterns were observed with nsd1 - nsd2, mal1 - mal2, and abs1 - abs2. The history of the phone number (or honeycard) could be a possible reason for these differences, as suggested by previous literature [13]. Additionally, these numbers were from different telecom providers in China, which may have influenced the observed differences.

Another interesting finding is that out of 301 SMS messages and calls on nsd1 and nsd2 combined, 289 were unsolicited, indicating a 0.96 probability of receiving an unwanted call or SMS message even if the number is not seeded (with slightly higher chances of receiving an unwanted message than calls at 98.25% vs. 88.88%).

#### 4.4 Effect of Seeding on Honeycards

In this section, we analyze the effectiveness of our seeding mechanisms. We first show the per-token volume of SMS messages and calls, as depicted in Figure 3 (a–f). To provide easy reference, we indicate the time when each honeycard was seeded using different seeding methodology as explained in Section 3.1.2.

We noticed sharper increases in the volume and sources right after seeding in many cases, most noticeable in abs1 and abs2. Although cumulative volume gives us a general idea of the total number of unsolicited SMS messages and calls received, we will focus on determining whether the contribution comes from more unique senders/callers or more messages/calls per sender/caller. Figure 3 (g–l) plots the cumulative number of sources, showing a significant increase in the number of unique sources during seeding, which contributed to the increase in volume. This indicates that telephony fraudsters are actively looking for new targets, such as through contact leakage from mobile malware, rather than simply targeting "alive" numbers.

#### 4.4.1 Abuse on soc1 and soc2

The use of social networks in seeding was very effective, especially for soc1. The total number of messages and calls received after seeding was statistically significantly higher (p = 0.0 and p = 0.025, respectively) than before seeding. This can be observed by the sudden increase in the rate of SMS messages received right after seeding (indicated by green bars on the x-axis). The increase for soc2 was less dramatic, but the Mann-Whitney statistical test also showed significant differences (p = 0.005) for SMS messages received before and after seeding, and a trend toward significance (p = 0.066) for calls.

The profile of the account used for soc1 was picked up by a media website called Xinhua Quanmei, which broadcasts daily news in the form of spam. We received a total of 221 messages related to websites involved in adware campaigns. This is also the most prevalent cluster of messages from contributor 106582622 (see Table 4). All messages from this source were received on the day soc1 was seeded.

In addition to the volume of calls and messages received by soc1 and soc2, we found that the number of sources contacting either soc1 or soc2 was significantly higher after seeding compared to before seeding (p = 0.01 and p = 0.015, respectively). However, the individual numbers of sources for calls and messages for both soc1 and soc2 approached acceptable levels of statistical significance but were not statistically significant. Soc2 received fewer hits compared to soc1 but was targeted by more sources.

#### 4.4.2 Abuse on mal1 and mal2
