believe this is because of their history and attackers abuse
them diﬀerently because they are not equally “dirty”. For
example, there is a big diﬀerence between the number of
calls and messages received on soc1 and soc2. soc1 and
soc2 received a total of 317 and 83 unsolicited calls and
SMS messages, respectively. soc1 received 281 SMS mes-
sages and 36 calls, while soc2 received 30 and 53 only, re-
spectively. Out of the 281 and 30 SMS messages received by
soc1 and soc2, 278 (98.9%) and 22 (73.33%) of them were
unsolicited respectively. Similar patterns are observed with
nsd1 - nsd2, mal1 - mal2, and abs1 - abs2. At this point,
we do not know the reason behind this bias, however, as
pointed out by previous literature [13], history of the phone
number (or honeycard in our case) could be one possible
reason. Also note that, these numbers were from diﬀerent
telecom providers in China, and we suspect that it might
play a role in the observed diﬀerences.
Another interesting ﬁnding is that 289 out of 301 SMS
messages and calls on nsd1 and nsd2 combined were found
to be unsolicited. This shows a probability of 0.96 of receiv-
ing an unwanted call or SMS message even if the number is
not seeded (with slightly higher chances of receiving an un-
wanted message than that for calls at 98.25% v/s 88.88%).
Again, this could have been heavily inﬂuenced by the history
of the honeycard and might not be interpreted as a ﬁnding
with general applicability.
We further explain data presented in Table 2 in the next
subsection to show eﬀectiveness of seeding.
4.4 Effect of Seeding on Honeycards
In this subsection, we focus on analyzing the eﬀectiveness
of our seeding mechanisms. We ﬁrst show the per-token
volume of SMS messages and calls, see Figure 3 (a–f). To
provide easy reference, we indicate in the ﬁgure (bars on
the x-axis) the time when each honeycard was seeded using
diﬀerent seeding methodology as explained in Section 3.1.2.
We notice sharper increases in the volume and sources
right after seeding in many cases, most noticeable in abs1
and abs2. We separately explain the reasons for each of
honeycard later in this section. Although (cumulative) vol-
ume gives us a general idea of the total number of unso-
licited SMS messages and calls received, in this section, we
will focus on ﬁnding out whether the contribution comes
from more unique senders/callers or more messages/calls per
sender/caller. Figure 3 (g–l) plots the cumulative number
of sources. It shows that there is an signiﬁcant increase in
the number of unique sources during seeding of honeycards
that had contributed to the increase in volume. This serves
as a clear indication that telephony fraudsters are actively
looking for new targets by, e.g., contact leakage from mo-
bile malware, instead of simply targeting numbers that are
“alive”.
4.4.1 Abuse on soc1 and soc2
The use of social networks in seeding was very eﬀective,
especially in the case of soc1 where the total number of
messages and calls received after seeding was statistically

Figure 3: (Cumulative) number of unsolicited calls (a–f ) and sources (g–l) for SMS messages and calls per
honeycard. On the x-axis, the green vertical bar (|) denotes the time(s) when the honeycard was seeded.
Note that we do not show the benign sources from ﬁgure (g–l). Calls are represented by blue color and SMS
messages with red. Benign is represented by o-o and unsolicited by x-x. For example, unsolicited calls are
represented by blue x-x and benign SMS messages by red o-o.

than the total number of messages and calls received before
seeding. This can easily be observed by the sudden increase
in the rate in which SMS messages were received right after
seeding (indicated by green bars on the x-axis). The increase
in the case of soc2 was not as dramatic, but the Mann-
Whitney statistical test also shows signiﬁcant diﬀerence (p =
0.005) for SMS messages received before and after seeding,
and a distinct trend toward signiﬁcance (p = 0.066) in the
case of calls. This is the ﬁrst sign of our success of seeding
the public honeycards soc1 and soc2 on online social media
which resulted in more unsolicited SMS messages and calls
than benign ones.
The proﬁle of account used for soc1 was picked up by
a media website called Xinhua Quanmei7 which broadcasts
daily news in the form of spam. We received a total of 221
messages related to websites involved in adware campaigns.
This is also the most prevalent cluster of messages from the
contributor 106582622 (see Table 4). All the messages from
this source were received right from the day on which soc1
was seeded.
In addition to the volume of calls and messages received
by soc1 and soc2, we found that the number of sources
contacted either soc1 or soc2 is signiﬁcantly higher after
seeding as compared to that before seeding (p = 0.01 and
p = 0.015, respectively). However, we found that individual
numbers of sources for calls and messages for both soc1 and
soc2 has approached acceptable levels of statistical signif-
icance but deﬁnitely not statistically signiﬁcant. soc2 re-
ceived fewer hits as compared to soc1, but at the same time
were targeted by more sources.
