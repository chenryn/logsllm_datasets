modiﬁed procedure used in this work is explained below. Fig. 3
shows exemplary the quantization scheme for a Gaussian
distributed parameter.
The basic factors for this procedure are the mean value µ
and the standard deviation σglobal of the global distribution of
a parameter calculated from all devices and the local variation
V (cid:48) which can be interpreted as the robustness of a parameter
affected by temperature and measurement noise. Ideally, the
cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution with
our mean µ and deviation σglobal is given by equation (1).
The global distribution is divided into several ranges Ai with
an equal probability of occurence until the whole distribution
is covered with a very high probability (6−σ). Each range has
a left bound Ai,l and a right bound Ai,r. Initially, the width of
the ranges A1 to the left and right of the global mean value µ
are deﬁned based on the value for V (cid:48). Afterwards, the further
ranges A2, . . . An are determined so that each range occurs
with the same probability, equation (2).

A bit combination is assigned to each range. The number
of bits that can be derived from a parameter in this way can
be calculated by log2(2 × An). This procedure is carried out
for all parameters and the key parts are concatenated to the
cryptographic key seed.
B. Experimental Setup
The measurements were carried out on wafer-level, i.e., the
devices are not in a mold package and laboratory measuring
equipment is used for all measurements. We use the probe
station PA 200 by S¨uss Micro Tec (Fig. 4) which enables to
measure a large number of devices fully automated and the
setting of temperature by a heatable chuck. Furthermore, the
test equipment consists of a multiplexer probe card for driving
and measuring on the different electordes and the Impedance
Analyzer 4294A by Agilent Technologies. For contacting the
sensor pads, a device with several contact probes is mounted
on the probe card.
The device under investigation was a 3-axis gyroscope. We
measured all parameters that are mentioned above (Section
II) for each channel so that we had in total more than 50
parameters of 70 devices. We repeated the measurements
multiple times at room temperature (RT) to determine the
repeatability of the measurements. Additionally, we carried
out the measurements at 85 ◦C to verify the robustness of the
parameters at higher temperature. As a result of the repeated
measurements and the temperature variation, we can describe
the parameter robustness as combination of a Gaussian dis-
tributed factor fnoise which is based on measurement noise
and a temperature dependent shift factor fshif t. Thus, the local
variation V (cid:48) of a parameter can be estimated from a measured
value V and this two factors in the following way:
V (cid:48)(T ) = fnoiseV + fshif t(T )

C. Parameter Results
As mentioned above, major inﬂuence factors on the param-
eter variation are the variation of the geometric dimensions
(structure width and thickness). For this reason, some of the
parameters are strongly correlated with this factors. Because
all measurement variables depend on them in a similar way, an
appropriate measure to reduce this dependency is to calculate
ratios. Thus, other effects become more important such as local
differences in the structure widths, for example.
Regarding the frequency modes, the use of ratios provides
a further advantage. The frequency modes are temperature
dependent in a linear way because of the temperature depen-
dence of the Young’s modulus [24]. Thus, the frequency modes
themselves vary about temperature with a constant factor. This
factor is deleted by calculating ratios and, hence, the ratios
are signiﬁcantly more stable about temperature than the pure
frequency modes. This also applies for the capacitances in a
similar manner.
As a ﬁrst result of the measurements, we can deﬁne the
following parameters as potentially appropriate (in brackets is
the quantity of a parameter type):
• frequency modes (9),
• capacitances (6),
• quadrature signals (2).
Hence, the further evaluations are based on this parameters.
Fig. 2a shows the percentage distribution of the τ values for
this properties. The proportion of 50% of ratios τ between 0
and 0.08 is mainly originated from the frequency mode based
parameters and the quadrature signals. The higher τ values

come from the ratios of capacitances. This is mainly caused
by their low σglobal-values.
In terms of cryptographic key generation, the consideration
of the correlation between the parameters is of fundamental
importance. We determine the correlations between all suitable
parameters. The correlation coefﬁcient RX,Y between two
parameters X and Y with N measurement values is calculated
by equation (4), whereas C =
is the covariance matrix. The covariance Cov(X, Y ) of X and
Y is given by equation (5).

PUF response is used as a cryptographic key a noisy response
is not acceptable. To solve this problem, algorithms known
as fuzzy extractors leverage non-secret helper data to work
around the noisy nature of physical measurements typical of
PUF applications (see Section VII). However, such a bit error
correction result in an entropy loss and means a reduced key
length. The amount of reduction depends on the number bit-
ﬂips that have to be corrected. This has to be assessed by the
BRRmax estimation.
In order to be able to estimate the robustness of a pa-
rameter, we repeated our measurements multiple times. As
we can describe the variability by Equation 3, we carry
out a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the probabili-
ties for dedicated bit error rates. Therefore, we create a
normally distributed random number matrix Z with dimen-
sions (number of keys i, number of parameters j) to re-
ceive the local variation of the parameters for a device
V (cid:48)(i, j)(T ) = fnoiseZ(j)V (i, j) + fshif t(j)(T ).
We estimate the BRRmax for different values of ρmax
with the associated probabilities P (BRR > BRRmax) for
a BRR above BRRmax. The probabilities are calculated from
a Poisson distribution ﬁt (see Fig. 5). The results are presented
in Table II. The values of each row are based on 10,000 keys
which are created by the Monte-Carlo simulation.
VI. ENTROPY ESTIMATION
An important aspect PUFs should show, besides robustness,
is randomness. This means that given all responses from all
PUF devices, an attacker should have a negligible chance of
estimating a future response of a PUF. Also the bits in a
response should be random and unpredictable, so that chances
for two responses from two different PUFs to be ”close” are
negligible small.
In order to assess the randomness of our PUF design, we
use the following methods:
The estimation of a maximal Bit Error Rate (BRRmax) is
of great signiﬁcance. The BRR denotes the difference between
two keys of the same device generated at different times or
environmental conditions (e.g., different temperatures) and it
is also known as the intra-distance which is a measure for the
robustness of a key. The BRR should be preferably 0, however,
due to the noisy nature of physical measurements, this is not
always achieved in practice.
Because of PUF variability across different environmental
conditions and measuring inaccuracy, when a PUF is chal-
lenged a noisy response is obtained. In applications where the
1) Inter and Intra Hamming Distances: To evaluate the
potential of physical properties for PUF applications,
the
ability to uniquely identify each instance is essential. This
can be formally deﬁned by the concept of inter and intra
Hamming distances. The inter distance HDinter depicts the
difference between two keys of different devices and it is
a measure for key uniqueness. The Intra-Distance HDintra
denotes the difference between two keys of the same device
generated at different times or environmental conditions (e.g.,
different temperatures). The Intra-Distance is a measure for
the robustness of a key and determines directly the number

of bit-ﬂips. An ideal PUF yields a HDintra = 0% and
HDinter = 50%.
2) CTW Compression: We try to compress our responses
with CTW (Context Tree Weighting), a lossless compression
algorithm [25]–[27]. This method is optimal for stationary er-
godic sources and gives an optimal compression. The resulting
compression on bit strings often used to estimate the entropy
rate [28]. The idea is that bit sequences with full entropy
cannot be compressed, meaning if a lossless compression is
possible, then our responses do not have full entropy. Thus,
CTW gives an upper bound on entropy.
3) NIST Randomness Test: We use the PUF responses as
input to the NIST randomness test suite [29] to verify, if
enough of these tests pass. This would indicate full entropy
with high probability. We conﬁgured each test in NIST SP800-
22 in the same manner as in [30], meaning the signiﬁcance
level of each test is set to 1%, so that 99% of the test samples
pass if the input was truly random. Let the number of samples
be n and the probability of passing each test is p, then the
number of passing samples follow a binomial distribution. The
value p(cid:48) of observed passings is then deﬁned as
(cid:114)
p(cid:48) = p ± 3
p(1 − p)
n
(6)
Also the NIST tests yield a P-value, generated by a χ2 test,
which indicates randomness on a an uniformly distributed
assumption if the P-value is ≥ 0.0001. In order to pass a
NIST test both conditions must be fulﬁlled – the proportion
of passed tests should exceed the above the threshold deﬁned
above and the P-value should be above 0.0001.
4) NIST Min-Entropy Estimation: Since CTW only gives
us an upper bound on entropy and the NIST randomness
test suite yield test results for full entropy or not, we try
to estimate the min-entropy with tests mentioned in NIST’s
special publication 800-90B [31], indicating a lower bound of
entropy for our purposes.
