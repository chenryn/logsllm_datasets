User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx Access Log: GET zc.qq.com? I found following entry in my access.log 

115.231.222.40 - - [02/Oct/2015:07:57:11] "GET http://zc.qq.com/cgi-bin/common/attr?id=260714&amp;r=0.8936631410048374 HTTP/1.1" 302 160 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0; 360SE)"


What does it mean? Do I have to worry?

Assistant: It looks like a spambot trying to send an invalid request, or possibly to see if your server is misconfigured to allow proxying.

Do you have to worry?  I find it a bit strange that a 302 status code is returned, as in 302 Found, I would expect such request to generate a 404 Not Found, or maybe 400 Bad Request or 403 Forbidden, but, in general, these kinds of requests should not cause much worry with properly configured modern servers.

(In your situation, I would guess that a 302 is returned because you redirect 404 pages to a single "not found" page?  If so, then, yes, you do have to worry in regards to the usability of your site, because that's not a good practice, as the user has no chance to easily correct a mistyped URL, since it just disappears into thin air, and they'd have little clue as to what's wrong.)
