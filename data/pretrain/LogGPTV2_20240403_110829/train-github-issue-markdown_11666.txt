I am currently using the v1.0.1 pre-release version. I have set up a single-machine cluster (version 0.19.3) by executing the `KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=ubuntu ./kube-up.sh` command, and it initialized without any issues.

Subsequently, I attempted to deploy Heapster on this cluster with the following command:
```bash
wicked@w:~/docker/kubernetes $ kubectl create -f cluster/addons/cluster-monitoring/influxdb --namespace=kube-system
```
This action resulted in the creation of the following Kubernetes resources within the `kube-system` namespace:
- Services: `monitoring-grafana`, `monitoring-heapster`, `monitoring-influxdb`
- Replication Controllers: `monitoring-heapster-v5`, `monitoring-influx-grafana-v1`

Five Docker containers were spun up as part of this process:
- `a8b397bb47d1`: Running `gcr.io/google_containers/heapster_grafana:v0.7` for Grafana.
- `78ce40555bb7`: Running `gcr.io/google_containers/heapster_influxdb:v0.3` for InfluxDB.
- `5bf518831100`: Running `gcr.io/google_containers/heapster:v0.16.0` for Heapster.
- `c5d90b64aca7` and `c63dbddfd38d`: Both running `gcr.io/google_containers/pause:0.8.0` as the base for the other containers.

However, the Heapster container is repeatedly encountering errors, as shown in the logs:

```
These errors indicate that there is an issue with the SSL/TLS certificates, specifically, the system is unable to load the necessary root certificates.
