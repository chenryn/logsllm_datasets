I'd like to be able to host a next.js app on it's own base path (e.g.
`/some/base/path/` \- on a configurable http proxy). This is primarily for use
with JupyterHub to run as a separate service (on e.g. `/services/nextApp`).
I've gotten everything to work for the express app (that uses next handlers
underneath) as well as the frontend's handling of the paths (the `req.params
-> query -> page/component` are awesome with next.js).
The only issue I'm running into is that `_next` is assumed to be at the
absolute path of `/_next` when it needs to be able to be served at
`/some/base/path/_next`.
    const app = next({ dev, baseURL: '/asdf' });
