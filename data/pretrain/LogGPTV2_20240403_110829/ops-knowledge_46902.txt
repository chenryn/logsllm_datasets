User: I have made a python script using python3.5, it uses many packages like tkinter, matplotlib, pylab etc. I want to convert .py file to .exe so that I can give it to people to run on windows. However I need to do the following conversion from Ubuntu only.
Assistant: in my opinion its not possible to create some executables in linux for windows
