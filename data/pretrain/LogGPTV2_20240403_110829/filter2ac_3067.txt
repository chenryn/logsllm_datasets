Bug Bounties, once heralded as a security best practice, are growing stale without ever having brought the revolutionary security benefits and great ways to earn a living to the masses that proponents like me dreamed of. What have we been getting wrong and what can we do to save security and our souls? Before Google invigorated the bug bounty practice in 2010 by paying nearly triple the going rate that Mozilla set in the mid-1990s, bug bounty programs had received little fanfare during their previous 20 years of existence. Then, in 2013, when these programs were still not considered mainstream for most organizations, Microsoft launched its programs with the largest bounty amounts in the industry by any software vendor at the time. Then, in 2016 came Hack The Pentagon, and suddenly everyone was either running a bug bounty program or wanted to run one.Where are we now and what have we learned since 2010? Were the myths of being able to compete on price with the offense market true or was it all just marketing by VC-backed bug bounty platforms? Is there an alternative solution for hackers who currently get treated like disposable workers? What's the best path forward for hackers, organizations, and the security industry now that we have seen over a decade of modern bug bounty programs in practice?This talk is for the dreamers, the wishers, the post-modern risk economists, the hackers of labor systems, the destroyers of status quos. This is not your grandson's bug bounty.
