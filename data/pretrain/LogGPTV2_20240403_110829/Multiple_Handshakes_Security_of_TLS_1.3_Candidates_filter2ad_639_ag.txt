2. Both the resumption master secret RMS and exporter
master secret EMS for export can also be generated during
resumption handshake.
Thus the proof is similar to that in [19] and due to space
limitations, here we provide a proof sketch in Table I listing
the modiﬁcations in each game.
Up to now, the proof for Lemma 4 has been completed.

Proof. Since Π is Multi-Level&Stage-secure, we just need
to show the Key Secrecy of the added session label(cid:2). Before
giving the detailed proof we need to show the relation between
label(cid:2) and label, where the session label is included in Π, and
label(cid:2).prelid = label.lid. In TLS 1.3 draft 10, PSK/resumption
can also use PSK in combination with an (EC)DHE exchange
in order to provide forward secrecy. During PSK/resumption-
(EC)DHE, the static secret SS equals to Pre-RMS derived
from label and the ephemeral secret ES are negotiated through
an (EC)DHE exchange. Thus we can also conﬁdently replace
the pre-shared resumption master key Pre-RMS with a uni-
formly selected (cid:2)Pre − RMS which will only be shared between
the two honest parties in label(cid:2) based on the Key Security of
label, and now we can focus on the security of label(cid:2) with
(cid:2)Pre − RMS indexed by psidU,V,k as follows.
(The result for label(cid:2)): PSK/resumption-(EC)DHE is secure
against Key Secrecy in a key-independent and stage-1-
forward-secret manner with concurrent authentication prop-
erties AUTH = (unauth, mutual, mutual, mutual).
The proof sketch for the above result is similar to that for
Lemma 3 for 0-RTT. Again, we consider two parts in one of
which the pre-shared key has never been corrupted and the
other the pre-shared key can be corrupted after the handshake
has been completed.
Part 1: uncorrupted pre-shared key
Firstly we show that
the adversary cannot
test a client
(or a server) session without honest contributive partner in
the ﬁrst stage. In this case test query to the session in stage
1 with authentication level unauth should be prohibited to
avoid trivial attack according to the security model. In later
the authentication level are all mutual due to the
stages,
implicitly authenticated pre-shared key shared between the
two parties, which means the adversary cannot successfully
complete the handshake without pre-shared key (As in the
proof of Lemma 3, and here PSK plays the similar role as
the certiﬁcate for authentication). Thus, we can analyze the
Key Secrecy under the assumption that the tested client (or
server) session has an honest contributive partner in the ﬁrst
stage, and the games during proof are listed in Table II.
Part 2:
handshake
the pre-shared key is corrupted after the
If the pre-shared key is corrupted after the session has been
completed, we need to set the stkey of xSS, mSS and FS to
revealed due to the compromise of the pre-shared key. Here
we also assume the tested session has an honest contributive
partner in the ﬁrst stage just like in Part 1, thus Key Secrecy
of label(cid:2) is still be satisﬁed due to the secrecy of ES = gxy,
which is similar to the discussion in Part 2 of Lemma 3, and
will be omitted here.
The advantage of the adversary in this case can also be
bounded as in Table II, except that Game 4 and the replace-
ment of mSS and FS in Game 7 will not exist any more
since xSS has been known to the adversary, and the other
probability loss would be the same and will be included in
the stated security bound of Lemma 5.
Up to now, the proof for Lemma 5 has been completed.
Above all, we have accomplished the proof of Theorem 1.
B. Compositional Security
In [22] and [19],
the authors present a compositional
framework for Multi-Stage-secure key exchange protocols
such that QUIC and TLS 1.3 full handshake can be securely
composed with arbitrary symmetric-key protocols under the
following condition:
499499
Authorized licensed use limited to: IEEE Xplore. Downloaded on March 18,2021 at 12:15:40 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. 
The compositional framework is only supported between
a key exchange protocol with key-independent stage-j for-
ward secrecy for some stage j and an arbitrary symmetric-
key protocol.
It would be desirable to prove the multiple handshakes secu-
rity of TLS 1.3 draft via game-based compositional framework
[22][19]. Unfortunately, 0-RTT in TLS 1.3 draft-10 cannot
be seen as a secure symmetric-key protocol, and moreover
PSK/resumption in TLS 1.3 draft-10 as a secure key exchange
protocol does not provide forward secrecy (with respect to
corruption of the pre-shared resumption master key), neither
of which satisﬁes the condition of compositional framework.
Therefore, the compositional security cannot be adapted to
the multiple handshakes security analysis above.
Different from the notion of composition,
the relations
between two sessions have been considered in our analysis.
We can guarantee the security of the module by combining a
secure key exchange with a non-symmetric-key protocol like
0-RTT in a new security model, however we do not rely on
