2. Both the resumption master secret (RMS) and exporter master secret (EMS) for export can also be generated during the resumption handshake. Thus, the proof is similar to that in [19]. Due to space limitations, a proof sketch is provided in Table I, which lists the modifications in each game.

Up to now, the proof for Lemma 4 has been completed.

### Lemma 5

If a multiple handshakes protocol \(\Pi\) is Multi-Level&Stage-secure, then the protocol \(\Pi'\) (obtained by combining \(\Pi\) with a session label \(\text{label}'\) such that \(\text{label}'.\text{mode} = M4\)) is secure against Key Secrecy. Formally, for any efficient adversary \(A\), the Key Secrecy can be broken with advantage \(\text{Adv}_{\text{Key-Secrecy},D}^{\Pi',A}\) such that:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{Key-Secrecy},D}^{\Pi',A} \leq \text{Adv}_{\text{Key-Secrecy},D}^{\Pi,A} + 2 \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{Coll}}^{H} + 4 \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{HKDF.Extract}} + 4 \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{HKDF.Expand}} + 5 \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{H}}
\]

Where \(n_s\) is the maximum number of sessions and \(n_u\) is the maximum number of users.

### Proof

Since \(\Pi\) is Multi-Level&Stage-secure, we need to show the Key Secrecy of the added session label \(\text{label}'\). Before providing the detailed proof, we need to establish the relationship between \(\text{label}'\) and \(\text{label}\), where the session label is included in \(\Pi\), and \(\text{label}'.\text{prelid} = \text{label}.\text{lid}\).

In TLS 1.3 draft 10, PSK/resumption can also use PSK in combination with an (EC)DHE exchange to provide forward secrecy. During PSK/resumption-(EC)DHE, the static secret \(SS\) equals the pre-RMS derived from \(\text{label}\), and the ephemeral secret \(ES\) is negotiated through an (EC)DHE exchange. We can confidently replace the pre-shared resumption master key Pre-RMS with a uniformly selected \(\tilde{\text{Pre-RMS}}\), which will only be shared between the two honest parties in \(\text{label}'\), based on the Key Security of \(\text{label}\). Now, we can focus on the security of \(\text{label}'\) with \(\tilde{\text{Pre-RMS}}\) indexed by \(\text{psid}_{U,V,k}\).

**Result for \(\text{label}'\):** PSK/resumption-(EC)DHE is secure against Key Secrecy in a key-independent and stage-1-forward-secret manner with concurrent authentication properties \(\text{AUTH} = (\text{unauth}, \text{mutual}, \text{mutual}, \text{mutual})\).

The proof sketch for this result is similar to that for Lemma 3 for 0-RTT. We consider two parts: one where the pre-shared key has never been corrupted and another where the pre-shared key can be corrupted after the handshake is completed.

**Part 1: Uncorrupted pre-shared key**

Firstly, we show that the adversary cannot test a client (or a server) session without an honest contributive partner in the first stage. In this case, a test query to the session in stage 1 with authentication level unauth should be prohibited to avoid trivial attacks according to the security model. In later stages, the authentication level is mutual due to the implicitly authenticated pre-shared key shared between the two parties, meaning the adversary cannot successfully complete the handshake without the pre-shared key (as in the proof of Lemma 3, where PSK plays a similar role as the certificate for authentication). Thus, we can analyze Key Secrecy under the assumption that the tested client (or server) session has an honest contributive partner in the first stage, and the games during the proof are listed in Table II.

**Part 2: Corrupted pre-shared key after the handshake**

If the pre-shared key is corrupted after the session is completed, we need to set the stkey of \(x_{SS}, m_{SS}\), and \(F_S\) to be revealed due to the compromise of the pre-shared key. Here, we also assume the tested session has an honest contributive partner in the first stage, just like in Part 1. Thus, Key Secrecy of \(\text{label}'\) is still satisfied due to the secrecy of \(ES = g^{xy}\), which is similar to the discussion in Part 2 of Lemma 3 and will be omitted here.

The advantage of the adversary in this case can also be bounded as in Table II, except that Game 4 and the replacement of \(m_{SS}\) and \(F_S\) in Game 7 will not exist anymore since \(x_{SS}\) is known to the adversary. The other probability loss remains the same and will be included in the stated security bound of Lemma 5.

Up to now, the proof for Lemma 5 has been completed.

### B. Compositional Security

In [22] and [19], the authors present a compositional framework for Multi-Stage-secure key exchange protocols, allowing QUIC and TLS 1.3 full handshake to be securely composed with arbitrary symmetric-key protocols under the following condition:

The compositional framework is supported between a key exchange protocol with key-independent stage-j forward secrecy for some stage j and an arbitrary symmetric-key protocol.

It would be desirable to prove the multiple handshakes security of TLS 1.3 draft via a game-based compositional framework [22][19]. Unfortunately, 0-RTT in TLS 1.3 draft-10 cannot be seen as a secure symmetric-key protocol, and PSK/resumption in TLS 1.3 draft-10 as a secure key exchange protocol does not provide forward secrecy (with respect to corruption of the pre-shared resumption master key). Therefore, the compositional security cannot be adapted to the multiple handshakes security analysis above.

Different from the notion of composition, our analysis considers the relationships between two sessions. We can guarantee the security of the module by combining a secure key exchange with a non-symmetric-key protocol like 0-RTT in a new security model, but we do not rely on the compositional framework.
