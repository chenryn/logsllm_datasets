## Port 5000 in Use by AirPlay Receiver
**Issue:**
Port 5000 is now occupied by the AirPlay receiver in the latest versions of macOS. This can be a nuisance, especially for developers using Flask, which typically runs on port 5000.

**Solution:**
There are two straightforward solutions to this problem:

1. **Use a Different Port:**
   - You can configure your application to use a different port. For example, you can start your Flask app on port 5001 by running:
     ```bash
     flask run --port=5001
     ```

2. **Disable the AirPlay Receiver:**
   - If you prefer to keep using port 5000, you can disable the AirPlay receiver. To do this, go to **System Preferences > Sharing**, and uncheck the "AirPlay Receiver" option.
