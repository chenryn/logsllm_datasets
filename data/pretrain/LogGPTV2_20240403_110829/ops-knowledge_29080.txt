User: I want to build Python 2.7.1 additionally to the one the redhat server already has pre-installed.
What options do I need to modify/use so that Python can be built under i.e. /opt/Python27
I would appreciate any help!
Assistant: Configure with:
./configure --prefix=/opt/Python27
In general, you can just do ./configure --help to get a list of all the options you're allowed to set for that configure script.
