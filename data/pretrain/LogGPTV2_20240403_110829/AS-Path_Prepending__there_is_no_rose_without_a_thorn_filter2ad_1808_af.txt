While most of our passive datasets are publicly available, we
cannot share any of the data received from CDNs and the European
IXP for validation purposes. As this limits the possibility for others
to take action based on our results, we tried, whenever possible, to
reach the network operators of ASes that consistently announce
uniform prefixes.
B MONITOR FILTERING
Figure 18 shows the distribution of the fraction of monitors that
observe a given prefix based on all routing information available on
January 15th of each year. While prefix visibility has increased over
the decade, we find a clear separation between two distinct regions
in the plot regardless of the year. On the leftmost side, we have
locally visible prefixes (seen by less than 20% of monitors), and on
the rightmost side, globally visible prefixes (seen by over 80% of
monitors). Based on this finding, we decided to remove all routes to
prefixes observed by less than one-third of all monitors, as indicated
by the threshold line. Notably, picking any other threshold between
0.2 and 0.8 only results in negligible differences.

A ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
To conduct our study, we relied on active as well as passive measure-
ments. When we used the PEERING testbed to actively announce
prefixes to the Internet, we ensured that we did not overwhelm any
networks by waiting 15 minutes between consecutive announce-
ments. When actively sending traffic from the PEERING testbed, we
ensured not to cause any harm through the following mechanisms:
(i) we sent probing packets at a low rate, i.e., each target IP was
probed with one ICMP, one TCP, and one UDP probe once per
minute. (ii) we avoided traffic bursts by spreading the sending of
probes equally throughout a one-minute interval. (iii) we included
our contact info in the payload of each probe providing details
on how to opt-out of the probing process. We have not received
complaints nor requests to opt-out of the experiments during the
entire duration of our active experiments.

origin pair.

C EFFECTIVENESS TIMELINE
Figure 19: Effectiveness experiment: Timeline and experi-
mental setting (PX : announcement of prefix P with X ∈
0, . . . , 3 prepends; WP : withdraw P.
In Figure 19, we depict the timeline of events and the configuration
scenarios from each iteration of our effectiveness experiment. First,
see Scenario T1, we create a baseline by announcing our prefix P via
all upstreams without any prepending. After waiting 15 minutes
to allow BGP to converge, we announce P with X prepends via
the chosen upstreams, see Scenario T2. After again waiting for 15
minutes to allow BGP to converge, we conclude the setup period
and start a 25-minute probing period. Each probe consists of ICMP,
TCP, and UDP pings triggered once per minute to all targets. To
reduce probing bursts, we spread the packets evenly across the
one-minute time interval. Before the cleanup, we have a 5-minute
break to ensure that the last responses can arrive before we with-
draw the prefix. After the break, we start the cleanup period with
the withdrawal of the announcements in every upstream, see Sce-
nario T3. To allow for BGP to converge and to minimize the risk of
BGP Route Flap Damping, we wait for 30 minutes before starting a
new iteration.
