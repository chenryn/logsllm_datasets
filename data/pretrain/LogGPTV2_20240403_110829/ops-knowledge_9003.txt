User: write a kql query for Bazacall emails
Assistant: This query looks for the subject lines associated with known Bazacall emails, using a regex to match on the fake account number pattern and a few keywords that are frequently used in these subjects. NOTE: Some emails contain the fake account number in the body of the email rather than the subject. In these instances, searching on keyword alone may surface related emails. Verify maliciousness by matching the regex for the account number in the body of the email if possible.
