### Conceptual Model of Value Chains in Cybercrime

**Key Components:**
- Fraud
- Mining (Cryptocurrency)
- Carding
- Accounts
- Financial Malware
- Reselling Credentials

**Value Chain Representation:**
Figure 2 illustrates a conceptual model of value chains, specifically focusing on the financial malware value chain. This model includes:
- Development and distribution of malicious apps
- Distribution of malware
- Take-over, i.e., logging of information
- Reselling and cashing out [23, 42]

**Common Resources:**
The resale of non-financial accounts often relies on the same resources as carding [23, 42]. Across these value chains, common components include:
- Development
- Distribution
- Take-over
- Cashing-out

These components can be merged into a single, unified model that applies to multiple value chains. In total, our model synthesizes all value chains into a set of 13 components. For example, malware can serve multiple purposes, such as development and take-over. Figure 2 provides a summary of this conceptual model and highlights the overall demand for B2B services in cybercrime.

### Measurement Methodology

Our methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection and Parsing:**
   - Collecting and parsing data on listings, prices, and buyer feedback from eight prominent online anonymous markets.
   - Using the parsed and analyzed dataset from Soska and Christin [40] to gather information about item listings and reviews.
   - Extending this data with 16 complete snapshots of AlphaBay collected from May 30, 2016, to May 26, 2017.

2. **Classification:**
   - Implementing a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to categorize listings into 10 categories of cybercrime components.
   - Adding six additional categories to distinguish B2C offerings: accounts, custom requests, fake documents, guides and tutorials, pirated goods, and vouchers.
   - Training and evaluating the classifier on a sample of 1,500 listings, with ground truth created via manual labeling.

3. **Ground Truth Labeling:**
   - Randomly selecting 1,500 items from the "Digital Goods" and "Miscellaneous" categories.
   - Identifying listings that contain multiple cybercrime components, package listings, and custom listings.
   - Ensuring at least 20 listings per category to avoid overfitting.

4. **Training and Evaluation:**
   - Excluding JavaScript malware, webinjects, and customer support from the classification due to a lack of listings in the random sample.
   - Data cleaning, tokenizing, and training the SVM classifier using Python and scikit-learn.
   - Handling class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
   - Evaluating the classifier's performance using a normalized confusion matrix, with an average precision of 0.78 and recall of 0.76.

### Post-Processing

- **Holding Prices:**
  - Correcting holding prices using a heuristic developed by Soska and Christin [40].
  - Manually identifying and removing 11 listings with clear instances of holding prices.

- **Misclassified Drug Listings:**
  - Removing misclassified drug listings, such as 12 Xanax listings, and leveraging unique terminology to identify additional false positives.

This comprehensive approach ensures a robust and accurate classification of cybercrime listings, providing valuable insights into the structure and operations of cybercriminal value chains.
