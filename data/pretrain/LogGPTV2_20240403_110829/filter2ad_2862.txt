most of the time, the adversary (even if it is
limited in scale/scope of simultaneous compro-
mise) has free reign and can move freely among
sensors, compromising them at will.
A very similar ”mobile adversary” model is
quite well-known in cryptography, having spawned
an entire line of research, called ”proactive cryp-
tography”. However, the mobile adversary model
has not been embraced by the security research
community. This talk will address several ﬂa-
vors of the mobile adversary in the context of
unattended sensor networks, discuss some vi-
able and simple counter-measures (with vary-
ing degrees of eﬀectiveness) and outline open
problems and challenges.
ABSTRACT
Unattended sensor networks operating in hos-
tile environments might collect data that rep-
resents a high-value target for the adversary.
The unattended sensor’s inability to oﬀ-load –
in real time – sensitive data to a safe external
entity makes it easy for the adversary to mount
a focused attack aimed at eliminating or mod-
ifying certain oﬀending data.
In order to fa-
cilitate data survival, sensors must collectively
attempt to confuse the adversary by changing
the location and the representation of the data.
Unfortunately, since the network is unattended
