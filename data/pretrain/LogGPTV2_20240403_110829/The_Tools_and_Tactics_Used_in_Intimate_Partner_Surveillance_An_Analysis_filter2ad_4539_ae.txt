### Exploiting Unconscious Partners

Once a partner is asleep or otherwise unconscious, attackers and responders offer various strategies to exploit their lowered defenses. These methods include overcoming two-factor authentication by resetting passwords on locked accounts and capturing verification codes. Additionally, they suggest planting monitoring tools for long-term surveillance, such as swapping SIM cards to capture call and text activity.

### Creating Fake Profiles for Social Media Access

Coercive attacks do not always need to be physical or direct; social media manipulation is another common tactic. Attackers use fake social media profiles to bypass privacy controls set by the target. While the use of fake profiles for direct harassment has been documented, we found that attackers are also using second- and third-degree connections to access a target’s profile.

In one thread on Forum A, a responder detailed a step-by-step process to create a believable Facebook account and use it to befriend the target's friends. This allows the attacker to access parts of the target’s profile that are hidden from the public but visible to friends-of-friends. The responder noted:

“After your friend request has been accepted, revisit the pages where you couldn’t see anything before. You’ll be shocked at how much information will suddenly be available, as many people set up security so it’s not public, but can be viewed by friends-of-friends. In my area, there are local bars with 1000+ friends, and every one of those 1000+ friends has now given access to those 1000+ people that allow friends-of-friends to see their info, and I’d guess over half do.”

The responder then advised attackers to ensure their real and fake Facebook profiles' privacy settings are set to show information only to the account owner, stating, “I don’t believe FB is secure.”

### Convincing a Partner to Provide Total Access

Our data also revealed that attackers and responders often advocate for convincing a partner to provide unfettered access to all devices and accounts. In the context of infidelity forums, this is often presented as a way to facilitate reconciliation after an affair:

“Tell her you need her iCloud password to review something. If she refuses, that’s a giant red flag. Then I suggest you say, ‘Wife, I love you dearly, but if I don’t see what’s on that phone, then you are telling me that you’re cheating. If you have nothing to hide, then let me see it.’”

Previous research by Freed et al. [19] reported that abusers often convince intimate partner violence (IPV) survivors to share their passwords during "good" phases of the relationship to establish trust, and then threaten them to continue sharing or face consequences when the relationship turns "bad." Our work extends this to show that attackers promote the idea of privacy compromise as a form of currency in abusive relationships, often describing it as key to overcoming the emotional toll of suspicions of infidelity. Many threads shared stories where partners who were previously suspected of cheating continued to share total access months or years later.

### Outsourced Attacks

The final category of IPS attacks in our data involves recommendations for external resources, such as private investigators (PIs), to investigate or monitor an intimate partner. In the context of infidelity forums, hiring PIs is often framed as a legal and ethical way to obtain information, as seen in this example from a responder on Forum B:

“You should hire a PI, who acts within the law to obtain the confirmation you require. But that’s all that it will be in the vast majority of cases... merely confirmation.”

Many PIs recommended in our data offered services within specific localities, often including a phone number and a person to ask for, or even a referral from the forum. Recommendations for PIs were often framed as more costly than other attacks, to be used as a last resort. One responder on Forum A remarked that PIs were expensive but “cheaper than a divorce lawyer.”

### Discussion

Our findings extend the IPS threat model outlined in this and prior works [6, 19]. Security experts seeking to prevent misuse of their work in IPS might consider accounting for this threat model in their technology development practices. Freed et al. [19] provides the concept of a UI-bound adversary as a consideration for design teams.

#### Online Forums as a Source of Threat Intelligence

Our work highlights how online communities can provide valuable intelligence on the motivations and tactics of intimate partner abusers. By observing interactions and promoted tools, we surfaced new knowledge on IPS strategies that can inform intervention efforts. For example, we found that attackers are not just inspecting call histories on shared family plans but are also sharing strategies to contact service providers and obtain more detailed records. We also uncovered more sophisticated attacks, such as using WiFi router tools to monitor and manipulate a partner.

Mining these forums for threat intelligence can help anti-IPS efforts stay ahead of evolving techniques. Future work could focus on creating semi-automated tools to scale such analyses. Current automated techniques may struggle with the nuanced language in user-generated content, but advanced language processing techniques could help extract specific strategies without relying on forum-specific features.

#### Impact on Anti-IPS Efforts

We have already shared our results with a team running a technology clinic providing interventions to IPV survivors facing IPS [17, 22]. They are integrating our threat intelligence into training materials and procedures for discovering and mitigating surveillance against their clients.

#### The For-Profit Industry Behind IPS Products

Our work shows that online ecosystems promoting spyware feature significant presence from companies marketing surveillance products. Some forums are filled with spam advertisements for specific spyware tools, suggesting they are used to manipulate SEO. Organic posts also reveal concerns of consumers, discussing the merits and drawbacks of various spyware products and market rates for voice-activated recorders, GPS trackers, and PIs.

These findings suggest a role for mitigation strategies targeting commercial entities. Prior work has shown ways to undermine commercially motivated spam and SEO attacks by working with banks and payment processors. Similar approaches could be effective in the context of IPS. Future work should investigate the mechanics of how forums are leveraged as marketing tactics by spyware companies to inform such countermeasures.

#### Platform-Level Defenses

Our work raises concerns for large social media platforms, where conversations escalating into IPS "how-tos" may occur in spaces not dedicated to infidelity or surveillance. Platforms could use our work to develop community norms or content moderation strategies, such as banning posts that escalate into IPS and encouraging de-escalation. Future work might investigate the scale of the problem within popular social media networks to develop such mitigation strategies.

Social media platforms might also consider the fake profile attacks discussed, using patterns we uncovered to more effectively surface falsified accounts. They might also de-emphasize second- and third-degree network connections or offer privacy controls that limit users’ audiences to first-degree connections by default.

#### Collaborative Creation of New IPS Attacks

Our work shows that people with significant training in computer security and privacy are helping to develop new IPS attacks. We found a high level of technical sophistication in some threads, including the use of custom shell scripts and methods for extracting information from iPhone backups and leveraging DNS resolution tools to manipulate Internet traffic.

This collaborative innovation is similar to behaviors seen in cybercrime forums, where sophisticated users create and sell tools to the community. These processes not only create more efficient attacks but also make them more accessible to less tech-savvy members, often providing one-on-one troubleshooting. Future research could further analyze the cooperative dynamics of these forums and compare them to known tactics used in offline settings.

#### Justifications for IPS in Infidelity Context

The forums we studied were rife with emotionally vulnerable people seeking and receiving assistance with interpersonal problems. However, they were also filled with attackers promoting the use of surveillance tools, often justifying it with infidelity. This context both attracts people seeking emotional support and masks them from social exclusion they might face if admitting to IPS in a non-infidelity context.

Future work could use these forums to identify cultural norms and justifications that encourage abusive behaviors. In conjunction with behavior change work with abusers, such work could develop alternative strategies for resolving suspicions of infidelity without resorting to IPS. These alternatives could be promoted on these forums to retain the supportive community structure while discouraging abusive practices.

#### Ethical Questions for the Computer Security Community

The infidelity forum setting creates gray areas for the computer security community. Some responders providing strategies for IPS were self-described security experts who felt justified in facilitating surveillance in toxic relationships. Their bespoke solutions, posted in publicly available forums, constitute a persistent record accessible to anyone. Well-meaning security experts may have facilitated IPS not just for the original poster but for numerous future readers.

We raise these tensions as open ethical questions for the security community.
