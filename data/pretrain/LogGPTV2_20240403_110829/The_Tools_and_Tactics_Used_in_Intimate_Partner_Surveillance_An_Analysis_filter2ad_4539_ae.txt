her out long enough for me to scan her texts and photos.
Any suggestions on how I get that phone?”
Once a partner slept or was otherwise unconscious, attack-
ers and responders offered a range of strategies for exploiting
their lowered defenses. These included ways to overcome two-
factor authentication schemes—namely, resetting passwords
on locked accounts and taking the opportunity to capture
codes—as well as ways to plant monitoring tools that could
track activity long-term, such as swapping their SIM card into
a partner’s device to capture their call and text activity.
Creating fake proﬁles to access their social media. Coer-
cive attacks did not necessarily need to be physical or direct:
we also found evidence of manipulations via social media.
Several threads showed attacks using fake social media pro-
ﬁles to overcome the privacy controls a target may have set.
While the use of fake social media proﬁles to directly harass
targets has been reported [19], we found evidence of attack-
ers leveraging fake proﬁles in a new way: using second- and
third-degree connections to access a target’s proﬁle.
In one thread on Forum A, a responder details step-by-step
how to fabricate a believable Facebook account, and use it to
befriend accounts that are friends with the target. The attacker
can thus access parts of the target’s social media proﬁles that
have been locked away from the attacker, but have remained
unlocked to what they believe are friends-of-friends. The
responder describes the access afforded thus:
“After your friend request has been accepted, revisit the
pages where you couldn’t see anything before. You’ll be
shocked at how much information will suddenly be avail-
able, as many MANY people set up security so it’s not
public, but can be viewed by friends-of-friends. In my
neck of the woods there are a lot of local bars that have
1000+ friends and guess what? Every one of those 1000+
friends has now given access to those 1000+ people that
allow friends-of-friends to see their info, and I’d guess
over half do.”
That responder then cautions attackers to ensure the privacy
settings on their real and fake Facebook proﬁles are set to
only show information to the account owner, because, the
responder says, “I don’t believe FB is secure.”
Convincing a partner to provide total access. Our data
also showed attackers and responders championing a strat-
egy of simply convincing a partner that unfettered access to
all devices and accounts should be expected in an intimate
partnership. In our context, inﬁdelity forums, this was often
raised as a way to facilitate reconciliation after an affair:
“Tell her you need her iCloud password to review some-
thing. If she refuses, that’s a giant red ﬂag. Then I suggest
you say ‘wife, I love you dearly, but if I don’t see what’s on
that phone, then you are telling me that you’re cheating.
If you have nothing to hide, then let me see it.’ ”
Freed et al. [19] previously reported that abusers often
convinced IPV survivors to share their passwords during
“good” phases of a relationship as a way to establish trust,
and subsequently threatened them to continue sharing or face
consequences when the relationship turned “bad”. Our work
extends this to show that attackers promote to each other
the idea of privacy compromise as currency in abusive re-
lationships, often describing this as key to overcoming the
emotional toll of suspicions of inﬁdelity. In fact, many of
these threads shared stories in which a partner who was sus-
pected of cheating in the past still shared total access months
or years later.
7.4 Outsourced attacks
The ﬁnal category of IPS attacks surfaced in our data are
those in which a responder recommends external resources
for investigation or monitoring of an intimate partner.
Private investigators (PIs). As expected for an inﬁdelity
forum context, many attackers and responders within our data
referenced hiring PIs to track their partners, with the goal of
ﬁnding evidence of an affair. Notably, hiring a PI was framed
as a legal and ethical way to obtain information, as in this
example from a responder on Forum B:
“You should hire a PI, who acts within the law to obtain
the conﬁrmation you require. But that’s all that it will be
in the vast majority of cases...merely conﬁrmation.”
Many of the PIs recommended in our data offered services
within their speciﬁc localities, e.g., “He does not do surveil-
lance unless the target originates in [speciﬁc U.S. state].”
These recommendations typically included a phone number
to call and a person to ask for—or even, in some cases, a
person from the forum to claim as a referral. In addition
to general recommendations to seek out PIs and referrals to
speciﬁc PIs, we also found one thread in which a responder
posted a link to the website of a speciﬁc national agency, as
well as another thread with a directory of ‘vetted’ PIs. These
recommendations were often framed as more costly than other
attacks, to be used as a last resort. One responder on Forum A
remarked PIs were expensive, but at least “cheaper than a
divorce lawyer”.

8 Discussion
We now synthesize takeaways from our ﬁndings for anti-IPS
efforts. First, our work extends the IPS threat model outlined
in this and prior works [6,19]. Security experts seeking to pre-
vent their work from misuse in IPS might consider account-
ing for this threat model in their technology development
practices—in particular, Freed et al. [19] supplies the concept
of a UI-bound adversary as a consideration for design teams.
We additionally outline broader considerations for security
experts. We begin by describing (1) the potential of these
online communities as a source for IPS threat intelligence,
including how our work is already impacting interventions.
We discuss what our work highlights for (2) how counter-
measures might target the commercial entities behind the
spyware industry, as well as (3) how large social media plat-
forms might address IPS-related content manifesting in their
spaces. We also highlight (4) the role security experts are
playing in collaboratively innovating on new IPS attacks in
these forums, and (5) justiﬁcations for IPS in the inﬁdelity
context. We close with a set of open ethical questions for the
security community.
Online forums are a rich source of IPS threat intelligence.
Our work highlights how analysis of online communities
can provide anti-IPS advocates with valuable intelligence
on the motivations and tactics of intimate partner abusers.
By observing how attackers interact in these forums and the
speciﬁc tools they promote for use, we were able to surface
new knowledge on IPS strategies that can directly inform
interventional efforts.
Our results conﬁrm ﬁndings from prior work that showed
the abundance of dual-use and overt spyware apps available
for attackers [6], and highlighting victims’ experiences of
tech-enabled abuse [19]. But the details of how, precisely,
abusers learn to mount these attacks had not previously been
reported, and attackers’ levels of sophistication had not been
well-understood. Our analysis highlights how attackers are
collaborating on new tactics in these forums, and surfaces
how these attacks are conducted at an unprecedented level
of granularity. For example, we ﬁnd that attackers are not
just inspecting targets’ call histories on shared family plans,
as has been reported previously [19]—they are also sharing
strategies on how best to contact service providers and obtain
more detailed records. We also surface novel attacks more
sophisticated than those previously reported in the IPS con-
text, for example the use of WiFi router tools to monitor and
manipulate a partner.
Mining these forums for threat intelligence might help anti-
IPS efforts stay ahead of attackers’ ever-evolving techniques.
We see substantial future work in creating semi-automated
tools that enable analyses like ours to scale. As our initial key-
word searches (Section 4) showed, the way IPS manifests in
user-generated natural language may be too nuanced for cur-
rent automated techniques alone to reliably detect. However,
human ratings are laborious and inefﬁcient and, importantly,
repeated exposure to stories of abuse can inﬂict harm on peo-
ple analyzing large bodies of such texts [15]. These problems
are exacerbated on large social media platforms, where the
volume and speed of conversations generated by millions of
users creates urgent problems of scale.
We see a role for advanced language processing techniques
in overcoming these challenges. For example, a system might
quickly and reliably extract the speciﬁc strategies recom-
mended within a post without relying on forum-speciﬁc fea-
tures (as applied in cybercrime marketplaces in [14]). Such
a system might provide a valuable pipeline for security and
privacy researchers and anti-IPV advocates building frontline
defenses against emergent attack strategies, for example the
Coalition Against Stalkerware.5
In fact, our work has already had impact in this regard. We
shared our results with the team of practitioners that runs a
technology clinic providing direct interventions to IPV sur-
vivors facing IPS [17, 22].6 At time of writing, they are work-
ing to integrate our threat intelligence into their training ma-
terials for advocates, as well as their clinic’s procedures for
discovering and mitigating how abusers are enacting surveil-
lance against their clients.
The for-proﬁt industry behind IPS products uses online
forums to market their tools. Our work also shows that the
online ecosystems promoting spyware feature a signiﬁcant
presence from companies creating and marketing their own
surveillance products. At one extreme, we found entire forums
bloated with spam advertisements for a single spyware tool,
suggesting these forums were leveraged to manipulate that
tool’s SEO. We also found that recommendations for IPS tools
are not just manifesting as spam advertisements and SEO for
speciﬁc spyware apps, but are also shared organically among
users in the forum communities.
Within these organic posts, responders engage meaning-
fully with forum-goers’ relationship problems, but also evan-
gelize speciﬁc IPS tools or approaches and even serve as
technical support for users’ spyware installations. Their posts
reveal the concerns of consumers in this market: we ﬁnd posts
on the merits and drawbacks of a range of spyware products,
both free and paid, and the market rates for voice-activated
recorders, GPS trackers, and PIs. All told, our analysis sug-
gests these forums are likely one corner of a broad industry
offering ‘solutions’ for would-be attackers to turn suspicions
of inﬁdelity into actualized IPS.
These ﬁndings suggest a role for mitigation strategies
that directly target these commercial entities. Prior work
has demonstrated ways to undermine commercially moti-
vated spam and SEO attacks by working directly with banks
and payment processors to make e-crime difﬁcult to mon-
etize [26, 33]. Similar approaches may be effective in the

context of IPS. Future work should investigate further the
mechanics of how forums like these are leveraged as market-
ing tactics by spyware companies, with the goal of informing
such ‘follow-the-money’ countermeasures. Similar counter-
measures might be also useful for security experts concerned
about keeping their tools from being misused for IPS: it is
possible, for example, that dual-use apps [6] are being ad-
vertised as spyware. Where possible, security experts should
prevent their tools from being marketed in this way.
Platform-level defenses might mitigate the spread of IPS.
In addition, our work raises concerns for large social media
platforms, where conversations escalating into IPS “how-tos”
may be happening in spaces that are not speciﬁcally dedicated
to inﬁdelity, surveillance, or intimate relationships.
We have highlighted features of IPS-relevant conversations,
and outlined an agenda for creating semi-automated tech-
niques to extract attackers’ strategies from such forums. Plat-
forms concerned about their role in enabling the spread of IPS
could use this work to develop community norms or content
moderation strategies attuned to these forums’ dynamics—for
example, the moderators of Forum C might consider banning
posts that escalate threads into IPS, and instead seek to en-
courage de-escalation. Future work might investigate further
the scale of the problem within popular social media networks
as a ﬁrst step to developing such mitigation strategies.
Social media platforms might also consider the fake proﬁle
attacks discussed in Section 7.3, and use the patterns we un-
covered to more effectively surface falsiﬁed accounts. They
might also consider de-emphasizing second- and third-degree
network connections in users’ experiences of their platforms,
or offer privacy controls that limit users’ audiences to ﬁrst-
degree connections by default.
Online communities are collaboratively creating new IPS
attacks. Our work also shows that people with signiﬁcant
training in computer security and privacy, while potentially
well-meaning, are actually helping to further develop IPS
attacks on these forums.
We were surprised to see the level of technical sophistica-
tion in some threads, particularly in contrast to the relatively
unsophisticated techniques reported in prior studies with vic-
tims [19, 32]. Some attacks did fall into the bucket of previ-
ously known techniques, for example physical privacy viola-
tions like shoulder surﬁng that are addressable through exist-
ing defense strategies [10, 28]. However, several involved the
use of custom shell scripts and other more sophisticated tech-
niques, including methods for extracting information from
artifacts like iPhone backups and leveraging DNS resolution
tools to manipulate a partner’s Internet trafﬁc.
In a sense, the IPS promoters who championed their home-
grown surveillance tools in these forums were engaged in a
process of collaborative innovation, working with other tech-
savvy community members to create and reﬁne new abuse
tactics. This is similar to behaviors seen previously in cyber-
crime forums [44], in which a handful of sophisticated users
create tools and then provide or sell them to the community.
These collaborative processes are not just creating more ef-
ﬁcient attacks, they are also making attacks more accessible
to more would-be attackers: much of the discussion on these
forums serves as how-to guides for less tech-savvy members,
and in many cases communities even provide one-on-one
troubleshooting. Future research might further analyze the co-
operative dynamics of how these forums develop new attacks,
and compare these against known tactics used to perpetrate
harm in ofﬂine settings (c.f., [23]).
Inﬁdelity is used as a justiﬁcation for IPS. The forums we
studied were rife with emotionally vulnerable people seeking
and receiving assistance with difﬁcult interpersonal problems.
But they were also rife with attackers freely admitting to and
promoting the use of surveillance tools against an intimate
partner, often by arguing that inﬁdelity justiﬁes surveillance.
In this, we see that the context of inﬁdelity both attracted peo-
ple to the forums as a site for emotional support and masked
them from the social exclusion they might have faced if admit-
ting to IPS in a non-inﬁdelity context [23]. This is particularly
concerning for anti-IPS efforts, as it can set a precedent of
using inﬁdelity as an excuse for abusive actions—a practice
mirrored in ofﬂine discussions with abusers in IPV [36].
We see compelling areas for future work in using these
forums to identify the cultural norms and justiﬁcations that
encourage abusive behaviors. In concert with ongoing behav-
ior change work with abusers [27], such work could draw on
the patterns of de-escalation we uncovered to develop alterna-
tive strategies for resolving suspicions of inﬁdelity without
resorting to IPS. These alternatives could be promoted be-
fore IPS on these forums, thereby retaining the supportive
community structure they provide to some forum-goers while
discouraging abusive practices.
The inﬁdelity forum setting also creates gray areas for
the computer security community at large. Some of the re-
sponders providing (ab)users with strategies for IPS were
self-described computer security experts who reported using
the same tools they promoted for surveillance in their profes-
sional work. In the context of helping people who reported
they were in toxic relationships, these experts may have felt
their material support facilitating IPS was justiﬁed. What’s
more, in the context of publicly available forums like the
ones in our study, these experts’ bespoke surveillance solu-
tions constitute a persistent record accessible to anyone on
the Internet with little effort. It is possible that well-meaning
computer security experts may have facilitated IPS not just for
the user who posted in the forum, but also for the numerous
people who would browse these threads in the future.
We raise these tensions as a set of open ethical questions for
