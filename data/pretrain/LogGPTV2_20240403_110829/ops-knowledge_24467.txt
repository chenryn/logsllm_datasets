User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题NodeJs App Not Showing On https I recently installed an SSL certificate, but as a result, my nodejs app only appears on http://something.com, and the apache default/stock directory listing is on https://something.com. I made it so that I get redirected to the https on entering the site name, but I don't know how to forever get rid of the Apache server directory listing "Index of /"...in it's ugly times new roman font.

I run the new apache 2, so in /etc/apache2/sites-available I have my 000-default.conf saying:

&lt;IfModule mod_ssl.c&gt;
&lt;VirtualHost *:*&gt;
ProxyPreserveHost On


ProxyPass / http://0.0.0.0:3000/
ProxyPassReverse / http://0.0.0.0:3000/
ServerName something.com
Redirect permanent / https://something.com

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;


I have a default-ssl.conf as well that has the address of the certificates and keys:

&lt;VirtualHost _default_:443&gt;
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html
    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

    SSLEngine on

    SSLCertificateFile /var/www/html/public.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /var/www/html/private.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /var/www/html/intermediate.crt

        &lt;FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$"&gt;
                SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
        &lt;Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin&gt;
                SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        &lt;/Directory&gt;

        BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
                nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
                downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
        # MSIE 7 and newer should be able to use keepalive
        BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown

    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
&lt;/IfModule&gt;

Assistant: I would like to suggest nginx as ssl offloader for your nodejs backend app. Here's the link for SSL config generator by mozilla.
