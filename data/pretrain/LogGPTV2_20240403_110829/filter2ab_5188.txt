**Title: Black Hat EU-21: Unnoticed Theft from Your Pocket: The Current State of Mobile Wallet Security**

Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay have become the go-to payment services for mobile users. Their growth and popularity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, have provided a convenient and often contactless way to make payments, reducing the need to touch payment terminals. Many consider mobile wallets to be at the forefront of payment security. However, our research reveals that these platforms may not adequately protect their customers from malicious actors; instead, they primarily safeguard their own interests.

In our investigation, we discovered inconsistencies in "contactless payment for public transport" schemes, which can be exploited to commit fraud using lost or stolen mobile phones. We successfully demonstrated this by defrauding victims through stores located around the world, all without the phone ever leaving the victim's pocket.

This talk will explore the intricate world of contactless payments on mobile wallets, including the underlying infrastructure and liability rules. We will delve into the vulnerabilities and discuss potential solutions to enhance the security of mobile wallet transactions.
