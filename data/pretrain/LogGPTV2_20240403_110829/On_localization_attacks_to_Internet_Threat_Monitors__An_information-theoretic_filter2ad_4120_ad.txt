### Theoretical Basis and Performance Gaps

Our theoretical results are grounded in Shannon's channel capacity theory, which provides an optimal lower bound for the minimum code length. To date, no coding scheme has been discovered that achieves this optimal bound [20]. The PN-code-based scheme in [14] employs a specific channel coding mechanism (i.e., the most intuitive correlation-based method). Our evaluation data will demonstrate that there is a performance gap between the PN-code-based scheme and the theoretical bound, indicating potential for future improvements.

### Background Traffic Simulation

For background traffic, we use real-world port scan traces from SANS ISC (Internet Storm Center) spanning from January 1, 2005, to January 15, 2005 [4]. We integrate simulated localization attack traffic into these traces and replay the merged data to emulate the localization attack traffic. Based on the traffic profile, we determine the background traffic statistics and thresholds for the defender. We evaluate different scenarios by varying the attacker and defender parameters. In this paper, we present data for port 135; experiments on other ports yield similar observations.

### Channel Capacity and Metrics

The channel capacity introduced in Sections IV and V is used to derive the minimum time length required for effective localization attacks. In our simulations, we use the same metrics. The basic idea is as follows: given a low false positive rate (≤ 1%), we run the simulation to find the minimal time length needed to achieve a specified detection rate (β) of the defender. We evaluate the performance of centralized, distributed, and hybrid detection against both temporal and spatial attacks. We set the number of monitors to 500, the chip duration \( t_c \) to 20 minutes, and the number of monitors \( v \) for the spatial attack to launch a coordinated attack to 25 or 50, which is significantly smaller than the total number of monitors.

### Simulation Results

**Centralized Detection vs. Temporal Attack (Fig. 3)**

- **Observation 1**: For a small detection rate (e.g., 2%) that makes the attack undetectable, the attacker can use a short time length of 10 hours based on the PN-code-based scheme [14] to identify the monitor. This validates that centralized detection is not effective against temporal attacks.
- **Observation 2**: There is a performance gap between the PN-code-based scheme and the theoretical bound. For example, at a 2% detection rate, the PN-code-based scheme requires a minimum time length of 10 hours, while the theoretical bound indicates that 4 hours would be sufficient. Advanced channel coding schemes, such as Turbo codes [20], could potentially reduce this gap, which we plan to investigate in future work.

**Distributed Detection vs. Temporal Attack (Fig. 4)**

- **Observation 1**: Given a reasonably small detection rate (e.g., 2%) that makes the attack undetectable, the attacker must use a time length of 5,000 hours for the PN-code-based scheme [14]. The theoretical bound is 1,650 hours, which is also quite long. This confirms that distributed detection is effective against temporal attacks.
- **Observation 2**: Similar performance gaps exist between the PN-code-based scheme and the theoretical bound due to the reasons discussed earlier.

**Distributed Detection vs. Spatial Attack (Fig. 5)**

- **Observation 1**: When \( v = 50 \), given a reasonably small detection rate (e.g., 2%) that makes the attack undetectable, the attacker only needs a relatively short time length of 94 hours for the PN-code-based scheme [14] and 36 hours for the theoretical bound to identify the monitors. This confirms that distributed detection is ineffective against spatial attacks.

**Hybrid Detection vs. Spatial Attack (Fig. 6)**

- **Observation 1**: The correlation analysis becomes effective because there is a clear difference between traffic containing an attack signal and traffic without an attack signal. This validates that hybrid detection is effective against spatial attacks.

### Related Work

Since CAIDA initiated the network telescope project in 2001 [8], many ITM systems have been developed and deployed. While the IP addresses of monitors can be protected by security mechanisms like encryption and Bloom filters [23], public data from these ITM systems can still disclose the IP address space covered by monitors [12, 13].

To preserve attack secrecy, the PN-code-based scheme was proposed in [14]. Our work is related to information hiding, a research area with applications such as copyright protection for digital media, watermarking, and steganography [24, 25]. For example, Arnold et al. [26] presented a classification of attacks against digital watermarks and possible countermeasures, categorizing them into removing, desynchronization, and noise-embedding attacks.

### Final Remarks

In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic framework to address issues related to localization attacks against Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems. We model the scan-query process as a side channel and derive closed-form expressions for the channel capacity of existing localization and temporal attacks. These formulas provide the minimal time length required for an attacker to achieve a detection rate in terms of scan traffic intensity. Under this framework, we discover a new class of localization attacks, spatial attacks, and develop a new scheme for detecting them based on traffic correlation from multiple monitors. We validate our theory using extensive numerical data and simulation results.
