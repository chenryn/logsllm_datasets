scheme in [14]. Notice that our theoretical result is based
on Shannon's channel capacity theory, which provides an
optimal lower bound for the minimum length of the code.
Hence, no coding scheme has been found that achieves
that optimal bound [20]. The PN-code based scheme in
[14] uses a specific channel coding mechanism (i.e., the
most intuitive correlation-based method). As we will show
in our evaluation data, there indeed exist performance gaps
between the PN-code based scheme and the theoretical
bound. This provides a space for future improvement in
performance.
For the background traffic, we use the real-world port(cid:173)
scan traces from SANs ISC (Internet Storm Center), which
includes the traffic logs from 01/01/2005 to 01/15/2005 [4].
We merge records of simulated localization attack traffic
into these traces and replay the merged data to emulate
the localization attack traffic. Based on the traffic profile,
we determine the background traffic statistics profile and
thresholds for the defender. We evaluate different scenarios
by varying the attacker and defender parameters. In this
paper, we only show the data on port 135; experiments on
other ports result in similar observations.
The channel capacity in Section IV and V is introduced
to derive the minimum time length for measuring the
effectiveness of localization attacks.
In the simulation,
we use the same metrics. The basic idea is illustrated
as follows: given a low false positive rate (:::; 1%), we
run the simulation and find the minimal time length for
achieving a given detection rate (3 of the defender. We
evaluate the performance of the centralized, distributed,
and hybrid detection, respectively, against temporal and
spatial attacks. We set the number of monitors to 500, the
chip duration tc to 20 minutes, and the number of monitors
v for the spatial attack to launch a coordinated attack to
25 or 50, which is much smaller than the total number of
monitors.
Fig. 3 shows the results for the minimal time length of
the attack vs. the detection rate (3, when the attacker uses
the temporal attack and the defender uses the centralized
detection. The results lead to a few observations. First,
given a small (e.g., 2%) detection rate which makes the
attack undetectable, the attacker can use a short time length

of 10 hours based on the PN-code based attack scheme
[14] to identify the monitor. It validates our findings that
centralized detection is not effective against a temporal
attack. Second, as expected, there are some performance
gaps between the PN-code based scheme (a special coding
mechanism) and the theoretical bound. For example, when
the detection rate {3 is 2%,
the PN-code based scheme
requires a minimum time length of 10 hours to accurately
identify the monitors, while the theoretical bound indicates
that a minimum time length of 4 hours will be enough.
We believe that by incorporating other advanced channel
coding schemes, such as Turbo code [20], we can make the
performance gap smaller (closer to the theoretical bound).
We leave this investigation to our future work.
Fig. 4 depicts the results for the minimum time length
when the attacker and the defender use a temporal attack
and distributed detection, respectively. The results give
rise to several observations. First, given the reasonably
small defender detection rate (e.g, 2%) which makes the
attack undetectable, the attacker must use a time length of
5,000 hours for PN-code based scheme [14]. As we can
see, the theoretical bound is 1, 650, which is also quite
long. This validates our finding that distributed detection
is effective against the temporal attack. Similarly, there
are some performance gaps between the PN-code based
scheme and the theoretical bound due to the same reason
discussed earlier.
Fig. 5 depicts the results for the minimum time length
performance when the attacker and the defender use a
spatial attack and a distributed detection, respectively. This
leads to a few more observations. First, when v = 50,
given a reasonably small detection rate (e.g, 2%) which
makes the attack undetectable, the attacker only needs a
relatively short time length of 94 hours for the PN-code
based scheme [14] and 36 hours for the theoretical bound
to identify the monitors. This validates the conclusion that
the distributed detection is ineffective against a spatial
attack.
Fig. 6 shows the correlation analysis for the traffic
from multiple monitors. As we can see from this figure,
the correlation analysis becomes effective because there is
a clear difference between traffic that contains an attack
signal and traffic that does not contain an attack signal.
This validates our findings that hybrid detection is effective
against spatial attacks.
VII. Related Work
Many ITM systems have been developed and deployed
since CAIDA started the project on network telescope
to monitor Internet traffic in 2001 [8]. Although the IP
addresses of monitors themselves can be protected by
security mechanisms, such as encryption and Bloom filter
[23], the public data reported by these ITM systems could
disclose the IP address space covered by monitors [12],
[13].
To preserve attack secrecy, the PN-code based scheme
is proposed in [14]. Our work is related to information
hiding, a research area with applications such as copyright
protection for digital media, watermarking, and steganog(cid:173)
raphy [24], [25]. For example, Arnold et al. presented a
classification of attacks against digital watermarks and pos-

sible countermeasures [26]. They categorized attacks into
different categories, such as removing, desynchronization,
and noise-embedding attacks.
VIII. Final Remarks
In this paper, we propose an information theoretic
framework to address issues related to localization attacks
against Internet Threat Monitoring (ITM) systems. In a
localization attack, an attacker sends scan traffic embedded
with a signal to a target network, and then queries the
ITM data center for traffic reports. If the attacker can
distinguish the signal from the reports, it is assured that
the target network is deployed with ITM monitors. We
model
this scan-query process as a side channel and
derive closed formulae for the channel capacity of existing
localization attacks, temporal attacks. Our formulae give
the bound of minimal time length, i.e. the signal length,
required for an attacker to achieve a detection rate in
terms of scan traffic intensity,
i.e., attack signal power.
Under this information theoretic framework, we discover
a class of new localization attacks, spatial attacks. We also
develop a new scheme for detecting spatial attacks based
on the traffic correlation from multiple monitors. We use
extensive numerical data and simulation results to validate
our theory.
