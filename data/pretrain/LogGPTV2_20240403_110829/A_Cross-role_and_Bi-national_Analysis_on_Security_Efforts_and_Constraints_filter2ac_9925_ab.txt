agement [4]. They found that vulnerability discovery efforts can be
hindered by human factors, e.g., trust, communication, funding, and
staffing issues. To understand how security managers handle staff’s
requirements and behavior, Reinfelder et al. interviewed security
managers [33] and indicated that organizational structures that
exclude staff from security development processes unintentionally
result in security managers viewing staff negatively. To the best of
our knowledge, few studies [30, 32, 36] in usable security research
have comparatively analyzed managers and developers through
their interviews and fieldwork and found that the major constraints
on security in software development come from organizational
structures. Our study is the first to quantitatively analyze the spe-
cific security awareness of managers and how the gaps between
managers and developers affect secure software developments.
3 METHODOLOGY
In this section, we describe how we designed our survey, recruited
participants, and ensured the quality of answer data. All questions
used in this paper (questions for screening and main survey) are
made available in Appendix A and B.
3.1 Survey design
Our survey questions are categorized into the three parts: (1) partici-
pant demographics, (2) development characteristics, and (3) security
behavior and awareness. Question formats include multiple options,
Likert scale, and free format. Descriptions of specific questions are
presented in Section 3.2.
In designing the questionnaire, we made iterations of reviews
to minimize the cognitive load of participants. Specifically, we first
351ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Fumihiro Kanei, Ayako Akiyama Hasegawa, Eitaro Shioji, and Mitsuaki Akiyama
designed a prototype of our questionnaire for (1) participant de-
mography and (3) security behavior and awareness on the basis
of the questionnaires presented in previous studies [6, 37]. Also,
on the basis of our interviews with five experts with rich software
development experience, we designed questions for (2) develop-
ment characteristics. After that, the prototype questionnaire was
thoroughly reviewed by the authors as well as by four development
experts, and questions that were semantically similar to other ques-
tions or difficult to understand were removed or revised. Finally,
we conducted a pilot survey with two development management
experts to check whether the questionnaire was sufficient and was
an appropriate length.
3.2 Questionnaire
3.2.1 Questions on development characteristics. We asked questions
about four development-related characteristics that may impact
software security: industry in which the software is used, user
scope of the software, contractual relationship of the project, and
development method used in the project.
Characteristic 1: User scope. We asked whether the software
being developed by participants was for use by the general public
or limited to specific users.
Characteristic 2: Contractual relationship. We asked what the
contractual relationship of the participants’ project was: in-house
development (the product is developed for the participant’s com-
pany) or contracted development (the product is developed for
another company). For participants that selected contracted devel-
opment, we additionally asked whether their company was the
prime contractor or a subcontractor. A prime contractor takes or-
ders for development directly from a client, while a subcontractor
takes orders from a prime contractor or another subcontractor.
Characteristic 3: Development method. We asked which of the
following development methods was adopted in the participants’
project: Waterfall, Agile, or a hybrid of the two (e.g., Spiral).
A similar survey was conducted by Assal and Chiasson [6] to
study the relationship between security and development meth-
ods, but they did not qualitatively study user scope, or contractual
relationship, which are new perspectives added in our study. Al-
though we selected the above development characteristics that have
a strong impact on security on the basis of interviews with pro-
fessional developers described in Section 3.1, there may be other
characteristics that can affect security as well (e.g., the type of
software and the industry in which it is used, such as financial
software). Thus, our future work is to analyze them for a broader
understanding of security in development projects.
3.2.2 Questions on security behavior and awareness. The question-
naire asked 32 questions (R1, E1–E15, A1–A5, and C1–11) about
the survey participants’ security behavior and awareness in their
development projects. First, question R1 asked about the amount of
resources spent on security efforts. Specifically, it asked about the
percentage of resources directed towards security out of the overall
resources in a project. Questions E1–E15, A1–A5, and C1–C11 asked
about security efforts practiced, security awareness, and factors
hindering security, respectively. These questions asked participants
to rate, on a 5-point Likert scale (Strongly agree, Agree, Neither
agree nor disagree, Disagree, Strongly disagree), how much they
agreed with a statement. For participants who were not aware of
what security efforts were in place, E1–E15 includes the option of
“Not sure”. Also, to cover the cases not listed, we added a question
with a free-format answer. These questions on security behavior
and awareness were designed on the basis of questions from ex-
isting studies [6, 37]. To minimize respondent fatigue, we reduced
the number of questions by merging similar questions. This was
carefully done on the basis of the feedback from a pilot survey
conducted with development management experts and discussions
among the authors. For example, the questions “Software security
does not fit in my schedule” and “I do not have time to address
software security” in [6] were merged into “C1. Our project does
not have enough time to ensure software security”.
3.3 Recruitment
Our survey focuses on software development in teams, so we target
managers in addition to developers who work on software develop-
ment. We conducted the survey with participants recruited through
a paid service offered by a survey company [23], which has a di-
verse participant pool in both the U.S. and Japan, in August 2020.
Participants were first asked a set of screening questions and then
filtered and grouped on the basis of the results.
Screening condition 1: Working in a team. We asked whether
participants were working on software development in a team of
multiple people and filtered out those who were not (e.g., non-
professional development). This filtering was necessary since our
study focuses on analyzing their roles and job title.
Screening condition 2: Developer or manager. We asked par-
ticipants which of the two roles they had: (1) developer (with de-
velopment tasks such as implementation, testing, and reviewing)
or (2) manager (with management tasks such as scheduling and
resource management). Additionally, we asked those who selected
the manager role if they had the authority to decide security efforts
in their project and filtered out those who did not. Generally, a
project has various kinds of managers (e.g., project managers and
product managers) who have different authority. The filtering was
necessary since our study focuses on how the security behavior and
awareness of managers having security-related decision-making
authority affect the security of the development. The effect of the
two screening conditions is described in Section 5.2.
All participants who passed the screening questions and com-
pleted the survey were paid US$10 worth of monetary reward. This
amount is well above the federal minimum wage calculated on the
basis of the average survey completion time.
3.4 Data quality
To ensure sufficient data quality, we excluded low-quality responses
on the basis of the following filter rules: responses that failed to pass
a simple attention check, responses with contradictions, responses
in questionnaires finished in less than five minutes, and responses
that included a meaningless answer in an open-ended question,
i.e., answers which seem to be filled mechanically without reading
questions.

3.5 Ethics
This study follows the research ethics principles stated in the Menlo
Report, and the survey questions and procedures were approved by
our Institutional Review Board (IRB). Participants were informed
in advance about the content of the survey and participated at
their own will. Collected personal data was handled in compliance
with the personal information protection laws of the participant’s
country.
4 RESULTS
In this section, we describe the basic survey statistics and the analy-
sis results concerning the three RQs described in Section 1. Since all
questions were optional in our survey as described in Section 3.1,
the results included empty answers. We excluded empty answers
from all analyses, and the actual number of answers used in each
analysis is stated in the corresponding subsection.
4.1 Participant demographics
Our analysis covered a total of 307 participants (162 developers and
149 managers) in the US and 357 participants (184 developers and
173 managers) in Japan as a result of the participant screening de-
scribed in Section 3.3 and the exclusion of invalid answers described
in Section 3.4. The average survey completion time for participants
with valid answers was 22.4 mins (Md=10.9). Table 1 presents the
participant demographics (Table 4 in Appendix D presents partici-
pant demographics in more detail). The participants’ ages and years
of experience were diverse, and so were the sizes of their companies
and projects, although companies or projects tended to be larger in
the US.
Regarding the user scope of developed software, software prod-
ucts for specific users outnumbered those for the general public.
This tendency was the same in the US and Japan. As for the contrac-
tual relationship, similar to the statistics shown in [25], the US had
more in-house developments (N =242, 79%), and Japan had more
contracted developments (N =246, 69%). Agile and Waterfall were
the most common development methods in both countries.
4.2 Factor analysis
We performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the results
of the security-related questions from the US participants (Fig-
ure 1). This enables us to reduce the number of variables used in
the analysis by grouping the results for each question by the com-
mon factor. EFA was conducted using principal axis factoring and
promax rotation, which is an oblique rotation method that allows
for correlated factors. Since individual factors related to security
behavior and awareness are likely to correlate with each other, we
used an oblique rotation method. The questions with factor load-
ings of 0.4 or higher for the common factors were grouped together,
