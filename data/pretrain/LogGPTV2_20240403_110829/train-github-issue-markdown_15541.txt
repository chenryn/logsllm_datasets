## ‚ùì Questions and Help

I am attempting to convert a PyTorch model, which includes a `grid_sample` operation, to ONNX. However, I encountered an issue where this operation is not supported in the conversion process. I am currently using PyTorch version 1.6.0.

This problem has been previously reported but remains unresolved in the following issues:
- [onnx/onnx#883](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/883)
- [PyTorch#27212](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/27212)
- [onnx/onnx#2383](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2383)
- [microsoft/onnxruntime#2962](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/2962)
- [AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model#92](https://github.com/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/issues/92)
- [NVIDIA/TensorRT#130](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/issues/130)

Could you please assist in adding support for the `grid_sample` operation in the ONNX conversion?
