## Implementation Checklist for Endpoints
Apply these best practices to all endpoints, including Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, and other devices.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Block Known Threats** | Use attack surface reduction rules, tamper protection, and block at first sight to prevent known threats. |
| **Apply Security Baselines** | Harden internet-facing Windows servers, clients, and Office applications with security baselines. |
| **Maintain Software** | Keep software updated and supported by rapidly deploying critical security updates and upgrading to supported versions. |
| **Isolate Insecure Systems** | Isolate, disable, or retire insecure systems and protocols, such as unsupported operating systems and legacy protocols. |
| **Block Unexpected Traffic** | Use host-based firewalls and network defenses to block unsolicited inbound traffic. |
| **Audit and Monitor** | Regularly audit and monitor systems to detect and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks. |

## Accounts
Just as antique skeleton keys won’t protect a house against a modern-day burglar, passwords alone cannot protect accounts against common attacks. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and passwordless authentication improve security and user experience. A Zero Trust infrastructure enhances security by storing information about trusted devices, reducing the need for out-of-band MFA actions.

### Program and Project Member Accountabilities for Accounts
This table outlines the responsibilities for protecting accounts from ransomware in a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy.

| Lead | Implementor | Accountability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CISO, CIO, or Identity Director | Executive Sponsorship |
| Program Lead (Identity and Key Management or Security Architecture) | Drive results and cross-team collaboration |
| IT and Security Architects | Prioritize component integration into architectures |
| Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations | Implement configuration changes |
| Security Policy and Standards | Update standards and policy documents |
| Security Compliance Management | Monitor to ensure compliance |
| User Education Team | Update password or sign-in guidance and perform education and change management |

### Implementation Checklist for Accounts
Apply these best practices to protect your accounts from ransomware attackers.

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Enforce Strong MFA or Passwordless Sign-In** | Start with administrator and priority accounts using methods like Windows Hello, Microsoft Authenticator app, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, or third-party MFA solutions. |
| **Increase Password Security** | Use Microsoft Entra Password Protection to detect and block weak passwords, and extend this protection to on-premises AD DS accounts. |
| **Audit and Monitor** | Regularly audit and monitor systems to detect and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks. |

### Implementation Results and Timelines
Aim to achieve these results within 30 days:
- 100% of employees actively using MFA
- 100% deployment of higher password security
