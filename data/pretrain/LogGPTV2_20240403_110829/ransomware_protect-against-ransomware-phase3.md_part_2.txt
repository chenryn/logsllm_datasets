### Implementation checklist for endpoints
Apply these best practices to all Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, and other endpoints.
|Done|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
||Block known threats with [attack surface reduction](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-deployment) rules, [tamper protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection), and [block at first site](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus).|Don't let lack of use of these built-in security features be the reason an attacker entered your organization.|
||Apply [Security Baselines](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/bg-p/Microsoft-Security-Baselines) to harden internet-facing Windows servers and clients and Office applications.|Protect your organization with the minimum level of security and build from there.|
||Maintain your software so that it is:  - Updated: Rapidly deploy critical security updates for operating systems, browsers, & email clients  - Supported:  Upgrade operating systems and software for versions supported by your vendors.|Attackers are counting on you missing or neglecting manufacturer updates and upgrades.|
||Isolate, disable, or retire insecure systems and protocols, including [unsupported operating systems](/lifecycle/) and [legacy protocols](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/retire-those-old-legacy-protocols/ba-p/259396).|Attackers use known vulnerabilities of legacy devices, systems, and protocols as entry points into your organization.|
||Block unexpected traffic with host-based firewall and network defenses.|Some malware attacks rely on unsolicited inbound traffic to hosts as a way of making a connection for an attack.|
||Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)).|Reduces risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings.|
## Accounts
Just as antique skeleton keys won’t protect a house against a modern-day burglar, passwords cannot protect accounts against common attacks we see today. While multi-factor authentication (MFA) was once a burdensome extra step, passwordless authentication improves the sign-in experience using biometric approaches that don’t require your users to remember or type a password. Additionally, a [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) infrastructure stores information about trusted devices, which reduce prompting for annoying out-of-band MFA actions.
Starting with high-privilege administrator accounts, rigorously follow these best practices for account security including using passwordless or MFA.
### Program and project member accountabilities for accounts
This table describes the overall protection of your accounts from ransomware in terms of a sponsorship/program management/project management hierarchy to determine and drive results.
|Lead|Implementor|Accountability|
|---|---|---|
|CISO, CIO, or Identity Director||Executive sponsorship|
|Program lead from [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture) teams||Drive results and cross-team collaboration|

### Implementation checklist for accounts
Apply these best practices to protect your accounts from ransomware attackers.
|Done|Task|Description|
|---|---|---|
||Enforce strong MFA or passwordless sign-in for all users. Start with administrator and [priority](/microsoft-365/admin/setup/priority-accounts) accounts using one or more of:  - Passwordless authentication with [Windows Hello](/windows/security/identity-protection/hello-for-business/hello-identity-verification) or the [Microsoft Authenticator app](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-phone-sign-in).  - [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-userstates).  - A third-party MFA solution.|Make it harder for an attacker to perform a credential compromise by just determining a user account password.|
||Increase password security:  - For Microsoft Entra accounts, use [Microsoft Entra Password Protection](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad) to detect and block known weak passwords and additional weak terms that are specific to your organization.  - For on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) accounts, [Extend Microsoft Entra Password Protection](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-password-ban-bad-on-premises) to AD DS accounts.|Ensure that attackers can't determine common passwords or passwords based on your organization name.|
||Audit and monitor to find and fix deviations from baseline and potential attacks (see [Detection and Response](protect-against-ransomware-phase2.md#detection-and-response)).|Reduces risk from ransomware activities that probe baseline security features and settings.|
### Implementation results and timelines
Try to achieve these results within 30 days:
- 100 % of employees are actively using MFA
- 100 % deployment of higher password security
