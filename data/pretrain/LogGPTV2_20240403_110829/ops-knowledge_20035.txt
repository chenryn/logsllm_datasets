### Summary of Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:07:00 to 18:07:06 on October 18, highlights several recurring issues and address changes in a Hadoop environment. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (PID: `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. The failure durations are increasing over time, starting at 122 seconds and reaching 127 seconds.
   - The log indicates that the system will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

2. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected for both the `LeaseRenewer` and `RMCommunicator Allocator` processes.
   - For the `LeaseRenewer`, the address change is from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - For the `RMCommunicator Allocator`, the address change is from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.

3. **Resource Manager (RM) Communication Issues**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` (PID: `RMCommunicator Allocator`) is unable to contact the Resource Manager (RM) at `msra-sa-41:8030`.
   - The system is retrying the connection with a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep(maxRetries=10, sleepTime=1000 MILLISECONDS)`.
   - The log shows that the system has already tried to connect 0 times, indicating that the first retry attempt is being made.

      - 18:07:01, 18:07:03, 18:07:05: Address change detected from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:8030` to `msra-sa-41:8030`.
    - **Errors**:
      - 18:07:02, 18:07:04: Error in contacting RM.

### Conclusion

The log indicates ongoing issues with lease renewals and communication with the Resource Manager, possibly due to the detected address changes. The system is attempting to handle these issues by retrying the lease renewals and connections, but the problems persist. Further investigation into the cause of the address changes and the network configuration may be necessary to resolve these issues.
