**bdehdcfg: Preparing Hard Drives for BitLocker Drive Encryption**

The `bdehdcfg` tool is designed to prepare a hard drive with the necessary partitions for BitLocker Drive Encryption. In most cases, Windows 7 installations do not require this tool, as the BitLocker setup process includes the ability to prepare and repartition drives as needed.

### Important Warning

There is a known conflict with the "Deny write access to fixed drives not protected by BitLocker" Group Policy setting, which can be found under:
- **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > BitLocker Drive Encryption > Fixed Data Drives.**

If `bdehdcfg` is run on a computer where this policy is enabled, you may encounter the following issues:

1. **Shrinking the Drive and Creating the System Drive:**
   - The drive size will be successfully reduced, and a raw partition will be created.
   - However, the raw partition will not be formatted.
   - **Error Message:** "The new active Drive cannot be formatted. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker."

2. **Using Unallocated Space to Create the System Drive:**
   - A raw partition will be created.
   - However, the raw partition will not be formatted.
   - **Error Message:** "The new active Drive cannot be formatted. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker."

3. **Merging an Existing Drive into the System Drive:**
   - The tool will fail to copy the required boot files onto the target drive.
   - **Error Message:** "BitLocker setup failed to copy boot files. You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker."

If this policy setting is enforced, the hard drive cannot be repartitioned because it is protected. If you are upgrading computers in your organization from a previous version of Windows and those computers were configured with a single partition, you should create the required BitLocker system partition before applying the policy setting to the computers.

### Syntax

```plaintext
bdehdcfg [–driveinfo] [-target {default|unallocated|shrink|merge}] [–newdriveletter] [–size <size>] [-quiet] [-restart]
```

### Parameters

- **-driveinfo:**
  - Displays the drive letter, total size, maximum free space, and partition characteristics of the partitions on the specified drive. Only valid partitions are listed. Unallocated space is not listed if four primary or extended partitions already exist.

- **-target {default|unallocated|shrink|merge}:**
  - Defines which portion of the drive to use as the system drive and makes that portion active.
  - **Options:**
    - `default`: Uses the default settings.
    - `unallocated`: Uses unallocated space to create the system drive.
    - `shrink`: Shrinks the existing drive to create the system drive.
    - `merge`: Merges an existing drive into the system drive.

- **-newdriveletter:**
  - Assigns a new drive letter to the portion of the drive used as the system drive.

- **-size <size>:**
  - Determines the size of the system partition when a new system drive is being created. The size is specified in megabytes (MB).

- **-quiet:**
  - Prevents the display of all actions and errors in the command-line interface and directs `bdehdcfg` to use the "Yes" answer to any Yes/No prompts that may occur during subsequent drive preparation.

- **-restart:**
  - Directs the computer to restart after the drive preparation has finished.

- **/? :**
  - Displays Help at the command prompt.

By using the `bdehdcfg` tool with the appropriate parameters, you can effectively prepare your hard drive for BitLocker encryption, ensuring that your data remains secure.
