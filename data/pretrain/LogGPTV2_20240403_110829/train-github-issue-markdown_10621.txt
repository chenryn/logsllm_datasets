### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Measuring calibration error in deep learning is a big issue now-a-days.
However, we do not find any suitable package available to measure the
calibration error. I would like to add a function that can measure calibration
error with adaptive bin size as described here:
https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/Uncertainty%20and%20Robustness%20in%20Deep%20Visual%20Learning/Nixon_Measuring_Calibration_in_Deep_Learning_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf.
Note that there are many ECE algorithms that measures the calibration error
with fixed bin size that is major problem for inhomogeneous data distribution.
### Describe your proposed solution
We already have a tentative implementation here:
https://github.com/neurodata/kdg/blob/cc88886819676020402f19ec8b224ed5aafdc440/kdg/utils.py#L8.
We would like to adapt the code for sklearn so that people can use it.
