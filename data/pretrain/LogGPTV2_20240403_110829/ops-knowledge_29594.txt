User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Using HTTP GET instead of a POST request can leak source code? Is it possible to leak the server-side code of a website if a GET request is sent instead of a POST request to a page? The idea is that if a POST request is made to a webpage e.g. http://&lt;server url&gt;/index.php, then the parameters passed via the POST request get read, the server side code e.g. PHP gets executed and a HTML output is returned to user. However, if a GET request is sent for a webpage to the server, then the server does not execute the server-side code - it simply returns index.php to the end user leaking the server-side code.

I have heard that this is a common vulnerability, but I am unable to find scenarios where this exists. Also what server configurations would typically allow this vulnerability to occur?

Thanks

John

Your assumption is wrong. A GET or POST does not change anything related to sourcecode leak. They are processed the same way, and the result will usually be HTML being sent back.

Main differences between POST and GET:


A GET request will show fully in the address bar, and a POST does not

Bookmarking a GET request with a password will also record the password, and a POST will not.
A GET request gets written fully on webserver logs, a POST generally not

If someone reads the logs of the webserver, all info of all requests can be read from a GET, but not from a POST


Using POST will make slightly harder to someone to conduct a CSRF attack against your site. But have absolutely nothing to do with a source leak.
