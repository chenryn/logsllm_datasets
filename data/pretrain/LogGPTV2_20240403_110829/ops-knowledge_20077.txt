User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Please analyze the following multiple lines of logs
 0 16:13:39.207 I Application requested orientation 1, got rotation 0 which has compatible metrics
 1 16:15:37.011 I Application requested orientation -1, got rotation 0 which has compatible metrics
 2 16:15:47.746 I Application requested orientation 1, got rotation 0 which has compatible metrics
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: ready=true,policy=<*>,wakefulness=<*>,wksummary=<*>,uasummary=<*>,bootcompleted=true,boostinprogress=false,waitmodeenable=false,mode=false,manual=<*>,auto=<*>,adj=<*>.0userId=<*>
B: printFreezingDisplayLogsopening app wtoken = AppWindowToken{<*> token=Token{<*> ActivityRecord{<*> u0 <*>/.<*> t761}}}, allDrawn= false, startingDisplayed =  false, startingMoved =  false, isRelaunching =  false
C: acquire lock=<*>, flags=<*>, tag="<*>", name=<*>, ws=<*>, uid=<*>, pid=<*>
D: Application requested orientation <*>, got rotation <*> which has compatible metrics
