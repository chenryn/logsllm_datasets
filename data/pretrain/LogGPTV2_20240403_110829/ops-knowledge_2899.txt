User: I am using ipdb to debug a python script.
I want to print a very long variable. Is there any ipdb pager like more or less used in shells?
Thanks
Assistant: You might want to create a function which accepts a text, puts this text into a temporary file, and calls os.system('less %s' % temporary_file_name).
To make it easier for everyday use: Put the function into a file (e.g: ~/.pythonrc) and specify it in your PYTHONSTARTUP.
Alternatively you can just install bpython (pip install bpython), and start the bpython shell using bpython. This shell has a "pager" functionality which executes less with your last output.
