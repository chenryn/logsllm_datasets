User: I have just installed Python 3.5.1 on my Mac (running the latest version of OSX). My system came with Python 2.7 installed. When I type IDLE at the Terminal prompt my system pulls up the original Python 2.7 rather than the newly installed Python 3.5. How do I get my system to default to Python 3.5.1 when I open the IDLE window from Terminal?
Assistant: Do right thing, do thing right!

Open your terminal,
input python -V, It likely shows:Python 2.7.10
input python3 -V, It likely shows:Python 3.7.2
input where  python or which python, It likely shows:/usr/bin/python
input where python3 or which python3, It likely shows:
/usr/local/bin/python3
add the following line at the bottom of your PATH environment variable file in ~/.profile file or ~/.bash_profile under Bash or ~/.zshrc under zsh.

alias python='/usr/local/bin/python3'
OR
alias python=python3

input source ~/.bash_profile under Bash or source ~/.zshrc under zsh.
Quit the terminal.
Open your terminal, and input python -V, It likely shows:
Python 3.7.2

Note, the ~/.bash_profile under zsh is not that ~/.bash_profile.
The PATH environment variable under zsh instead ~/.profile (or ~/.bash_file) via ~/.zshrc.
Hope this helped you all!
