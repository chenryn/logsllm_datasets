concluded that the Italian ISP does not have any NAT444 deployment.
4.2 Large-Scale Measurement Campaigns
After the above validation exercise, we experimented with NAT Revelio on two
diﬀerent large-scale measurement platforms (SamKnows’ UK deployment and
BISmark), targeting multiple ISPs and potential NAT444 solutions.

SamKnows Deployment. We deployed the Revelio Client on a set of SamKnows
Whiteboxes within home networks in the UK. A SamKnows Whitebox is a cus-
tom hardware device that residential users host voluntarily. We ran NAT Reve-
lio from 2,000 Whiteboxes that allowed us to test 26 diﬀerent ISPs for NAT444
solutions. We had no previous knowledge of the conﬁguration of these ISPs. We
collected results of tests of two diﬀerent Revelio deployments that we performed
5 months apart, in June 2014 and October 2014. Although they did not cover
the same subscribers, both campaigns yielded similar results, indicating that the
NAT444 deployment did not expand during the ﬁve-month period.
The results of June 2014 campaign revealed that out of the approximately
2,000 residential lines we tested, we inferred that 10 diﬀerent end-users connected
behind a NAT444 solution. The 10 users were spread across 5 diﬀerent ISPs.
Thus, the proportion of end-users we inferred were behind a NAT444 solution
was 0.5 % of all the residential lines we tested. We were able to validate these
ﬁndings with the operators for only for one case.2 The operator in question
validated our inferences for the lines we found to be deployed behind a NAT444
solution.
Analyzing the results from the June 2014 campaign, we inferred that a total
of 90 % of tested end-users were not connected through a NAT444 solution (no
NAT444). The Environment Characterization phase of NAT Revelio helped
us discard 60 % of the cases of in-home cascaded NATs that would have otherwise
emerged as false positives.
In the NAT444 Discovery phase, the Invoking UPnP Actions test
(Sect. 3.3.2) successfully ran on 82 % of the SamKnows Whiteboxes, further
identifying 81.2 % of the tested customers as not conﬁgured to use a NAT444
solution. In the other 18 % of the cases, UPnP was not supported by the home
gateway, so we could not run this test. Additionally, the Traceroute to the GRA
(Sect. 3.3.3) independently classiﬁed approximately 50 % of the end-users we
tested as not behind a NAT444 deployment. In 9.5 % of observed cases, we could
not draw a conclusion because all tests included in the NAT444 Discovery phase
gave inconclusive results.
The October 2014 deployment covered fewer subscribers (approximately
1,500 SK Whiteboxes) than the one in June 2014 (approximately 2,000 SK
Whiteboxes). We found that 4 ISPs deployed NAT444 solutions. The results we
obtained for 3 of the 5 ISPs were consistent with the results we inferred of the
June 2014 campaign. We detected one additional ISP for which the Subscriber
Device (Whitebox) connected directly to the Service Demarcation Device, but
for which the Service Demarcation point address was a private (Sect. 3.3.2). We
give high conﬁdence to this result.3
2 Attempting to validate our ﬁndings, we have contacted all the 5 ISPs, but we have
yet to receive a reply from 4 of them.
3 Attempting to validate this result, we found that several subscribers reported on the
ISP’s online customer support forum that they had identiﬁed the presence of the
CGN by detecting the presence of shared address space in the ISP.

BISmark Deployment. Between 7–9 February 2015, we deployed NAT Revelio on
37 OpenWRT routers that are part of the BISmark measurement platform. Our
BISmark experiment involved fewer vantage points than our SamKnows UK
experiment, but they had much wider geographical distribution. We deployed
the Revelio client in Subscriber Devices hosted in 24 diﬀerent ISPs active in 13
countries distributed across the ﬁve Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Using
the Revelio test suite, we inferred the presence of NAT444 in three diﬀerent
ISPs: Vodafone for DSL customers in Italy, Embratel in Brasil and Comcast in
the US. In all three cases, we inferred a NAT444 solution by establishing the
presence of RFC1918 private addresses in the ISP access network (Sect. 3.3.1).
The traceroute to the GRA (Sect. 3.3.3) gave inconclusive results in all three
cases. Also, in the case of Embratel and Comcast, the Revelio client could not
invoke UPnP actions (Sect. 3.3.2). Since an ISP may use RFC1918 addresses in
the access network without deploying a NAT444 solution, we give low conﬁdence
to the latter two results, and mark them as potential false positives. In the case
of the Subscriber Device connected to Vodafone Italia, the Revelio client could
invoke UPnP actions and verify the presence of the NAT444 solution in the ISP.
We give high conﬁdence level to this result, where two Revelio tests detected
NAT444 deployment.
5 Related Work
In recent years, detection of middleboxes, and characterization and assessment
of their impact on the Internet, has become a topic of interest. In particular,
researchers have studied how to identify the presence of middleboxes on the
Internet path, including NAT444 solutions. A recent study proposed NATAn-
alyzer [10], an algorithm capable of discovering previously unknown cascaded
NAT conﬁgurations. NATAnalyzer requires control of the client and server sides
of the test, whereas NAT Revelio is a client-side discovery mechanism. NATAn-
alyzer determines the position of the NAT devices using repetitive traceroutes.
First, the test establishes address mappings in NAT devices on the path by run-
ning a traceroute from the end-user side to the server. NATAnalyzer then relies
on ﬁxed NAT state timers to sequentially ensure that the per-hop mappings
expire, while maintaining the rest of the mappings by sending traﬃc from the
external server towards the client (a NAT conﬁguration that represents a secu-
rity risk and is not recommended). The algorithm does not account for timers
that may diﬀer for multiple NAT conﬁgurations across various networks. Revelio
does not rely on any features of NAT devices, treating them as black boxes along
the path.
The Netalyzr [9] tool, initially meant as a networking debugging tool, is
continuously running a survey of the health of the Internet’s edge by detect-
ing anomalous conﬁgurations. This survey includes detection of NAT solutions.
Unlike Revelio, Netalyzr is not speciﬁcally tailored to detecting NAT444 solu-
tions, and might not be robust to non-standard conﬁgurations inside home net-
works.

Tracebox [5] is an extension to the widely used traceroute tool that detects
various types of middlebox interference over an Internet path. The solution is
prone to open issues aﬀecting traceroute. Though this can also potentially impact
Revelio, our test-suite also includes other tests which we can fallback on.
6 Conclusions and Future Work
Despite concerns about its performance impact, NAT444 is part of the technol-
ogy landscape during this ongoing phase of transition from IPv4 to IPv6. In this
paper, we proposed NAT Revelio, a novel methodology and test suite aimed at
accurately detecting NAT444 deployments by running active tests from the home
network. We validate the accuracy of our approach by evaluating the status of a
control set of 6 residential lines tested in a NAT444 deployment trial within the
network of a large UK operator. We tested the robustness of the test suite to a
non-standard conﬁguration by evaluating the status of 24 DSL residential lines
connected to a large Italian ISP that does not deploy NAT444, but uses private
addresses in its access network.
The large scale NAT Revelio distribution across the UK showed that NAT444
solutions are still in early stages of deployment in the UK. However, our results
infer that operators are at least testing these solutions to potentially move them
in production. Using the BISmark platform, we tested 24 additional ISPs active
in 13 countries distributed across the ﬁve Regional Internet Registries (RIRs).
We inferred the presence of NAT444 in three diﬀerent ISPs and proved our
solution to be highly versatile.
For future work, we will expand testing to other regions, where NAT444
solutions are more popular. In particular, we will deploy NAT Revelio in the
SamKnows FCC Measuring Broadband America testbed in the US. We also
plan to tackle the limitations of the proposed methodology, namely by designing
other detection algorithms in the case when assumed CPE capabilities are not
implemented or networks actively block ICMP packets.
