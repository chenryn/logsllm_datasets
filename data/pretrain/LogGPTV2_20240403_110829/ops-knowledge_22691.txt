It sounds like you have already installed `libffi` and set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable correctly, and `pip` recognizes that `libffi` is installed. However, when you try to install `pyOpenSSL`, `pip` reports that it cannot find the `ffi.h` file. Even though you know that `ffi.h` exists and you are aware of its directory, the issue persists.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the development package for `libffi` is also installed. This package includes the necessary header files, such as `ffi.h`, which are required for building and installing `pyOpenSSL`.

- On Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu), you can install the development package with:
  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
  ```

- On Red Hat-based systems (like CentOS or Fedora), use:
  ```sh
  sudo yum install libffi-devel
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  sudo dnf install libffi-devel
  ```

After installing the development package, try installing `pyOpenSSL` again using `pip`. This should resolve the issue with `pip` not being able to find the `ffi.h` file.
