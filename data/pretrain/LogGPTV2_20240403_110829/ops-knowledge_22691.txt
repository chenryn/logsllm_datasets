User: I have installed libffi on my Linux server as well as correctly set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to the correct directory, as pip recognizes that it is installed; however, when trying to install pyOpenSSL, pip states that it cannot find file 'ffi.h'. I know both thatffi.h exists as well as its directory, so how do I go about closing this gap between ffi.h and pip?
Assistant: You need to install the development package as well.
libffi-dev on Debian/Ubuntu, libffi-devel on Redhat/Centos/Fedora.
