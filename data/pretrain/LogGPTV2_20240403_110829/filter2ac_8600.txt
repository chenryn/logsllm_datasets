### Title: Black Hat Asia 2020: Page Cache Attacks - Microarchitectural Exploits on Flawless Hardware

In recent years, processor optimizations have frequently introduced new microarchitectural side channels. The impact of these side-channel attacks ranges from minor nuisances that require software workarounds to highly critical vulnerabilities that can leak arbitrary memory contents. While new attack vectors continue to emerge, developing effective defenses remains a significant challenge.

In this presentation, we begin with a brief overview of the current state of microarchitectural attacks and defenses. We then explore a hypothetical scenario where a futuristic CPU has eliminated all microarchitectural side effects, rendering existing attacks ineffective. Even in this idealized setting, we demonstrate that microarchitectural attacks are not entirely eradicated. We present methods for executing well-known microarchitectural attacks without relying on any hardware-specific side effects, making these attacks hardware-agnostic.

We show that attack primitives, which typically exploit hardware, can be shifted to the software level, simplifying their execution and making them independent of the underlying CPU architecture. The attacks we discuss are effective on Windows, Linux, and Android, and they work on both x86 and ARM processors. Our demonstrations include the creation of high-speed covert channels, the bypassing of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) on Windows 10, the leakage of highly sensitive information for targeted extortion and spam campaigns, and the use of UI redressing attacks to respond to system activity. Additionally, we showcase an attack on the generation of temporary passwords in vulnerable cryptographic implementations.

The vulnerability discussed in this talk is identified by CVE-2019-5489.
