Weaponizing

General Flow of talk
•My compardres and I, whom I’ll introduce as we go along, are going to talk to you about some research we conducted to see to what extent you can determine peoples personality 
traits through their Facebook activity and what fun things you could do, armed with that knowledge. and because this is DEF CON, how you might EXPLOIT the knowledge of 
someones personality traits from social networking activity. 
•We’ll also look at how you might ﬂy under the radar or even subvert the attempts of others to gain an insight into your personality through these means
•you’ll see that this is still a pretty untapped area, so our hope is to get some of you suitably inspired to take a look in this area too, before it’s abused

• I will start us off with a brief introduction to Personality Traits. This should put us in a good position for understanding the rest of the talk.
• Then weʼll discuss the research experiment we conducted called “The Big 5 Experiment”, which looked at peoples Facebook activity in relation to their personality types.
• weʼll then look at how we analysed the data and what the results told us.
• in “Weaponizing” weʼll look at how knowledge of someones personality can be used and abused
• and ﬁnal, in “Subverting” weʼll look at techniques you could use to thwart the attempts of others to make decisions based on personality derived through Facebook activity.
Personality

General Flow of talk:
• So, Personality 101...let me ﬁrst tell you how I got interested in Psychology.

• ...and we meet Carl Jung, who some might consider the godfather of personality types.
• “It was Jung who suggested that human behavior could be classified by how people go about such basic functions as gathering information and making 
decisions based on that information. He realized that some people orient themselves to the world outside themselves (extroverts) and some people orient 
themselves to their inner world (introverts). He then named the cognitive processes that all people engage in — thinking, feeling, sensing, and intuiting — to 
come up with eight types.” (See ﬁrst reference below)
• Weʼll talk more about these traits later. While he proposed these traits, he didnʼt provide a test, in the way many of us are used to seeing these days...

• If we assume a normal distrubution, most people are going to somewhere in that middle ground.
•Now, it doesnʼt mean that MBTI states this, itʼs the way itʼs often used.  itʼs often used by people who donʼt understand that thereʼs a spectrum and that the way you answer the 
questions can differ depending on a variety of variables, such as your mood or amount of sleep.

FIVE
17
General Flow of talk
• ...The Five Factor Model. Sometimes called, “The Big 5” or “OCEAN”.  OCEAN because it covers 5 high order personality dimensions
•Openness
•Conscientiousness
•Extroversion
•Agreeableness and
•Neuroticism   (more of this shortly).
• The Five Factor Model does score people on a spectrum
• There are a number of tests available to determine these traits, from tests with 100 or more questions to tests with 10 questions.
•In research terms, and as far as Iʼm aware, the ﬁve factor model has received more scrutiny than any other personality model
•For our, non-proﬁt objectives there was one ﬁnal important point. Free tests exist. Free to non-proﬁts in anycase... so lets take a look at those 5 dimensions.

• For someone high in Openness, I chose “Doc” (Emmett Brown) from back to the future

•Creative
•Imaginative
•Curious
•Inventive
•Deep thinking
•Thatʼs why I chose the “Doc”.  Now, conversely...
