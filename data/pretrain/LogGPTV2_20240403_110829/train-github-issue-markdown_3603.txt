I am trying to
`import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';`
in my next.js project but I get following error
`Module parse failed: Unexpected token (6:3) You may need an appropriate
loader to handle this file type, currently no loaders are configured to
process this file`
I have `next.config.js` file in root directory of project. It has this
configuration
    // next.config.js 
    const withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css');
    module.exports = withCSS({
      cssLoaderOptions: {
        url: false
      }
    });
I followed this comment which apparentlyworks but not for me. Any ideas why?
