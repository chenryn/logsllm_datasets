I have been using Eclipse for over three years, primarily for Java EE and Spring development. I have managed to complete 90% of my tasks without needing to use the mouse. My typical Eclipse setup includes the following plugins:

- **Subclipse** (or alternatively, the command line)
- **m2eclipse** (Maven Eclipse plugin)
- **Data Source Explorer** (for handling SQL)

The key activities I perform in Eclipse, which I would like to replicate in Vim or Emacs, include (this is for multi-module, multi-project, and multi-folder source code):

1. **Refactoring**: Rename methods throughout the entire "open project."
2. **Navigation**: Jump to class implementations.
3. **Search**: Find all usages of a particular class or method.
4. **Dependency Management**: Update third-party JARs via `pom.xml` using Maven.
5. **Library Navigation**: Jump to the implementation of third-party libraries (e.g., Hibernate entity manager). Maven can download the `source.jar` if it is not available in the local repository, allowing me to view the actual Java code.
6. **Testing**: Write and run unit tests.

All these activities can be performed without using the mouse. There are a few tasks, such as global file search, where I occasionally need to use the mouse.

Recently, I have been interested in trying development within virtual machines (VMs). The idea is to set up a minimal VM (e.g., Ubuntu Server) and start coding there, possibly using PuTTY/SSH. I own a 13-inch MacBook Pro, which would benefit from using a lightweight editor like Vim or Emacs.

My two main goals are:

1. **Mobility**: The ability to travel and code efficiently.
2. **VM Development Environment**: Using a VM as my primary development environment.

The tools I plan to use include:

- **Operating System**: Linux
- **Programming Languages**: Ruby, Python, PHP (and occasionally Java, but definitely not Microsoft .NET)
- **Database**: Any RDBMS
- **Build/Dependency System**: Any suitable system
- **Unit Testing Framework**: Any suitable framework

### Recommendations

I am seeking advice on whether to use **Vim** or **Emacs**. Additionally, I am open to suggestions for other tools that could complement my setup, such as **Gnu Screen** and **ctags**.

### My Ideal Environment

- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage.
- **Productive**: Efficient and effective for my workflow.
- **Easily Replicable**: Easy to set up and configure on different machines.

Thank you for your help in building my dream development environment!
