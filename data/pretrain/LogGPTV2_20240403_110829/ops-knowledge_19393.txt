User: I've been an Eclipse user for the last 3 years or more. I do Java EE (and Spring) development in it and so far I've done 90% of my tasks without having to touch the mouse. Typically my Eclipse setup is as follow:

Subclipse (or alternatively I use command line) 
m2clipse (Maven Eclipse plugin) 
Data Source Explorer (dealing with SQL)

The typical Eclipse activities I do (and would like to transfer that to Vim/Emacs) are (this is for multi-module/multi-projects/multi-folder source code):

Refactor (rename method throughout the whole "open project")
Jump to class implementation
Search for all usage of a particular class or method
Updating dependencies (3rd party JARs) via maven pom.xml
Jump to the 3rd party library implementation (maven can download the source.jar if local repository does not have it, eclipse will bring me to the actual Java code for let say, Hibernate entity manager implementation).
Write and run unit-test

All of the above activities would not require me to use mouse. There are a few activities where I would need to use a little bit of mouse such as Global Search file
Lately I've been wanting to try development using VMs. The idea here is to create a barebone VM (let's say to use Ubuntu Server) and start coding there or use Putty/SSH. 
I have a MacBook Pro 13" which would benefit of using VIM/Emacs or any lightweight editor.
There are 2 major goals:

Mobility (as in, travelling and coding)
VM as development environment

Tools I'd like to use are as follow:

Linux
Ruby, Python, PHP (and occasionally maybe even Java but definitely not Microsoft .NET)
Any RDBMS
Any build/dependency system
Unit-testing framework

What would you recommend: VIM? Emacs? Others? What about other tools? Gnu Screen, ctags, etc. 
Help me build my dream environment: lightweight, productive, easily replicable :)
Thanks!
Assistant: I am an Emacs guy (using vi only to edit configuration files under /etc). I think that with Emacs, you should start it at most daily (and it is very different with vim), and you should configure it in your .emacs file. For example, I compile using the F12 key, with  (global-set-key [f12] 'recompile) in my .emacs.
