1
These are really simple tricks.
2
Not a survey of research literature (but see last slides).
You can do much cooler stuff with entropy etc.
3
NOT on-line IDS/IPS stuff:
Learning the “normal” values, patterns.
Statistical training −→ black box “oracle”.
Once trained, hard to understand or tweak.
4
These tricks are for off-line log browsing (“analysis”).
Entropy & friends:
What can they do for us in everyday log browsing?

The UNIX pipe length contest
What does this do?
grep ’Accepted password’ /var/log/secure |
awk ’{print $11}’ | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
/var/log/secure:
Jan 13 21:11:11 zion sshd[3213]: Accepted password for root from 209.61.200.11
Jan 13 21:30:20 zion sshd[3263]: Failed password for neo from 68.38.148.149
Jan 13 21:34:12 zion sshd[3267]: Accepted password for neo from 68.38.148.149
Jan 13 21:36:04 zion sshd[3355]: Accepted publickey for neo from 129.10.75.101
Jan 14 00:05:52 zion sshd[3600]: Failed password for neo from 68.38.148.149
Jan 14 00:05:57 zion sshd[3600]: Accepted password for neo from 68.38.148.149
Jan 14 12:06:40 zion sshd[5160]: Accepted password for neo from 68.38.148.149
Jan 14 12:39:57 zion sshd[5306]: Illegal user asmith from 68.38.148.149
Jan 14 14:50:36 zion sshd[5710]: Accepted publickey for neo from 68.38.148.149

Can we do better than pipes & tables?
Humans naturally think in classiﬁcation trees:
Protocol hierarchies (e.g., Wireshark)
Firewall decision trees (e.g., iptables chains)

Use tree views to show logs!
Pipes, SQL queries → branches / paths
Groups ↔ nodes (sorted by count / weight), records ↔ leaves.

Trying to deﬁne the browsing problem
The lines you need are only
20 PgDns away:
...each one surrounded by
a page of chaff...
...in a twisty maze of
messages, all alike...
...but slightly different, in
ways you don’t expect.

Old tricks
Sorting, grouping & ﬁltering:
Shows max and min values in a ﬁeld
Groups together records with the
same values
Drills down to an “interesting” group
Key problems:
1
Where to start? Which column or protocol feature to pick?
2
How to group? Which grouping helps best to understand
the overall data?
3
How to automate guessing (1) and (2)?

Estimating uncertainty
Trivial observations
Most lines in a large log will not be examined directly, ever.
One just needs to convince oneself that he’s seen
everything interesting.
Zero in on “interesting stuff”, must fold away and ignore the
rest.
The problem:
Must deal with uncertainty about the rest of the log.
Measure it!
There is a measure of uncertainty: entropy.

Automating old tricks (1)
“Look at the most frequent and least frequent values” in a
column or list.
What if there are many columns and batches of data?
Which column to start with? How to rank them?
It would be nice to begin with “easier to understand” columns or
features.
Suggestion:
1
Start with a data summary based on the columns with
simplest value frequency charts (histograms).
2
Simplicity −→ less uncertainty −→ smaller entropy.
