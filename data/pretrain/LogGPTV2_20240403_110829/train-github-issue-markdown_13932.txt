The exception information generated when executing the `INSERT` method in MySQL is captured by the `execute` catch block within the `JDBCExecutorCallback` class. The method returns a `false` value, indicating that the operation was not successful. This results in the business logic being unable to retrieve the specific exception details.

To improve clarity and professionalism, the revised text is as follows:

When an exception occurs during the execution of an `INSERT` statement in MySQL, it is caught by the `execute` method's catch block within the `JDBCExecutorCallback` class. The method then returns `false`, signifying that the operation failed. Consequently, the business logic is unable to obtain the detailed exception information, leading to a failure in handling the error appropriately.
