I have been using Julia-1.0 at the Terminal and under Jupyter for some time
under the previous MacOS. I recently upgraded to Catalina 10.15.2. I can still
use Julia 1.0 under Terminal, but when I try to run the new Julia-1.3, I get
the alert:
> “Julia-1.3” can’t be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious
> software.
Update: I am able to get around this by approving within "System Preferences /
Security & Privacy".
Not sure, but I am guessing this is related to the new required app
notarization under Catalina. Anyone want to fight with this? Maybe someone can
update the instructions in the meantime.
