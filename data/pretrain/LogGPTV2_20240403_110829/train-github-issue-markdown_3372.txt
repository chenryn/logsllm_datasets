Hi everyone,
cache:clear won't run up correctly anymore. It can't delete
dev_old/annotations/(some_folder). I think it's because the filename length in
(some_folder) is too long now compared to the 2.7 Symfony version. I'm running
on Windows 7.
Look at the filename for example:
5b5b435d53796d666f6e795c42756e646c655c57656250726f66696c657242756e646c655c436f6e74726f6c6c65725c50726f66696c6572436f6e74726f6c6c65722474656d706c6174654d616e61676572405b416e6e6f745d5d5b315d.doctrinecache.data
If I try to rename this file by removing some char, cache:clear works again
(actually, it goes farther then it bugs on another file which has the same
problem)
Does someone have a solution ?
Regards
