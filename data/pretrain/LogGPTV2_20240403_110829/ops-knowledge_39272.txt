User: I have a question regarding the command for running the training in Linux. I am using GoogleNet model in caffe framework for binary classification of my images. I used the following command to train my dataset
./build/tools/caffe train --solver=models/MyModelGoogLenet/quick_solver.prototxt
But I received this error
bash: ./build/tools/caffe: No such file or directory
How can I resolve this error? Any suggestions would be of great help.
Assistant: Follow the below instructions and see if it works:

Open a terminal
cd to caffe root directory
Make sure the file caffe exists by listing them using ls ./build/tools
If the file is not present, type make. Running step 3 will list the file now.
Type ./build/tools/caffe, No such file error shouldn't get triggered this time.
