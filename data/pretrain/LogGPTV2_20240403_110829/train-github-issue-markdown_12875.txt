### Vue.js version
1.0.20
### Reproduction Link
https://jsfiddle.net/ardoramor/hyk86ca3/
### Steps to reproduce
Run fiddle, examine console.
### What is Expected?
Entries will be tracked by the specified path, just like in filters (e.g.,
`orderBy`)
### What is actually happening?
VueJs prints out a warning and fails to get the unique value specified by path
### Required change
There are three lines that would need to change from `value[trackByKey]` to
`getPath(value, trackByKey)` in functions `cacheFrag`, `getCachedFrag`, and
`deleteCachedFrag`. I can make a PR but maybe such a small change doesn't
require it?
Also, is it possible to add expression evaluation for `track-by`? This way, a
combination of fields can yield a unique identifier (e.g., `track-
by="employee.company + employee.id"`, in case `id` can be reused by
companies). I have a different application but this should make sense as well.
