responsible for at least 8% of the spam we receive. The fraction,
while not overwhelmingly large, is notable because of the conven-
tional wisdom that most spam today originates from compromised
Windows machines that are serving as botnet drones.
Finding 5.1 (Bobax vs. spammer distribution) Spamming hosts
and Bobax drones have similar distributions across IP address
Finding 5.2 (Prevalence of spam relays by OS type) About 4%
of the hosts sending spam to the sinkhole are not Windows hosts
but our sinkhole receives about 8% of all spam from these hosts.

5.3 Spamming Bot Activity Proﬁle
The results in Section 5.2 indicate that an overwhelming fraction
of spam is sent from Windows hosts. Because a very large fraction
of spam comes from Windows hosts, our hypothesis is that many
of these machines are infected hosts that are bots. In this section,
we investigate the characteristics of spamming hosts that are known
to be Bobax drones. Speciﬁcally, we seek to answer the following
three questions:
1. Intersection: How many of the known Bobax drones send
spam to our sinkhole?
2. Persistence: For how long does any particular Bobax drone
send spam?3
3. Volume: How much of the spam from Bobax drones origi-
nates from hosts that are only active for a short period of
time?
The rest of this section explores these three questions. Although our
trace sees spam from only a small fraction of all Bobax-infected
drones, this sample nevertheless can offer insight into the behavior
of spamming bots.
5.3.1 Intersection and prevalence
To satisfy our curiosity (and to compare with other claims about
the amount of spam coming from botnets [3]), we wanted to deter-
mine the total fraction of received spam that originated from bot-
nets versus other mechanisms. The circumstantial evidence in Sec-
tions 5.1 and 5.2 suggests that the fraction of spam that originates
2Alternatively, this spam might be sent from Windows machines whose
stacks have been modiﬁed to emulate those of other operating systems. Al-
though we doubt that this is likely, since most spam ﬁlters today do not
employ p0f checks, we acknowledge that it may become more common in
the future, especially as spammers incorporate these techniques.
3Previous work has noted that the “DHCP effect” can create errors in es-
timation for both persistence and prevalence (e.g., a single host could dy-
namically be assigned different IP addresses over time) [19]. Although the
DHCP effect can introduce problems for estimating the total population of
a group of spammers, it is not as problematic for the questions we study
in this paper. Since one of our objectives is to study the effectiveness of
IP-based ﬁltering (rather than, say, count the total number of hosts), we are
interested more in measuring the persistence of IP addresses, not hosts.
from botnets is quite high. Unfortunately, there are no techniques
for isolating botnets from mail logs alone; we can only determine
whether a particular piece of spam originated from a botnet based
on whether the IP address of the relay sending the spam appears in
our trace of machines known to be infected with Bobax.
Even this information is not sufﬁcient to answer questions about
the amount of spam coming from botnets, since machines other
than Bobax-infected hosts may be enlisted in spamming botnets.
Indeed, good answers to this question depend on both additional
vantage points (i.e., sinkhole domains) and better botnet detection
heuristics and algorithms. Not only will more vantage points and
better detection algorithms aid analysis, but they may also prove
useful for massively collaborative spam ﬁltering—identiﬁcation of
botnet membership, for example, could prove a very effective fea-
ture for identifying spammers.
At our spam sinkhole, we receive spam from only 4,693 of the
117,268 Bobax-infected hosts in our command-and-control trace.
This small (though certainly non-negligible) view into the Bobax
botnet emphasizes the need for observing spamming behavior at
multiple domains to observe more signiﬁcant spamming patterns
of a botnet. Nevertheless, this set of hosts that appear both in our
spam logs and in the Bobax trace can provide useful insight into
the spamming behavior and network-level properties of individual
bots; it also appears to be a reasonable cross-section of all spam-
ming bots (Figure 6 indicates that the IP distribution of bots from
which our sinkhole receives spam is quite similar to the distribu-
tion of all spamming hosts across IP address space as shown in
Figure 2).
5.3.2 Persistence
Figure 7 shows the persistence of each Bobax-infected IP ad-
dress that sent spam to the sinkhole. The ﬁgure indicates that the
majority of botnets make only a single appearance in our trace;
these “single shot” bots account for roughly 25% of all spam that
is known to be coming from Bobax drones.
Finding 5.3 (Single-shot bots) More than 65% of IP addresses of
hosts known to be infected with Bobax send spam only once, and
nearly 75% of these addresses send spam to our sinkholed domain
for less than two minutes, although many of them send several
emails during their brief appearance.
Of the spam received from Bobax-infected hosts, about 25% orig-
inated from hosts that only sent mail from IP addresses that only
appeared once. The persistence of Bobax-infected hosts appears to
be mildly bimodal: although roughly 75% of Bobax drones per-
sist for less than two minutes, the remainder persist for a day or
longer, about 50 persist for about six months, and 10 persist for en-
tire length of the trace. Although these short-lived bots do not yet
send the majority of spam coming from botnets, this “single shot”
technique may become more prominent over time as network-level
ﬁltering techniques improve and spammers employ more sophisti-
cated evasion techniques.
Because most bot IP addresses are short-lived, we hypothesized
that IP-based blacklists (e.g., DNSBL ﬁltering) would be somewhat
ineffective for blocking spam. To our surprise, Figure 4 shows that
the botnet hosts from which we received spam were actually more
likely to be listed than the typical spamming mail relay (although,
as we describe in Section 4.2, the technique appears to be somewhat
ineffective in general). Intuitively, this result is justiﬁable, because
other domains likely received spam from drones with the same IP
addresses. This result also demonstrates the beneﬁts of collabora-
tive spam ﬁltering, which facilitates the identiﬁcation of spammers

that send only a single piece of spam but send spam to multiple
domains.
5.3.3 Volume and Rate
Figure 8 shows the amount of spam sent for each Bobax drone,
plotted against the persistence of each drone. This graph shows that
most Bobax drones do not send a large amount of spam, regardless
of how long the drone was active. Indeed, nearly all of the Bobax
drones observed in our trace send fewer than 100 pieces of spam
over the entire period of the trace. This ﬁnding suggests that spam-
mers have the ability to send spam from a large number of hosts,
each of which is typically used for a short period of time and nearly
always used to send only a relatively small amount of spam. Thus,
not only are IP-based ﬁltering schemes likely to be ineffective, but
volume-based detection schemes for spamming botnets may also
be ineffective.
Finding 5.4 (Spam arrives from bots at very low rates)
Regardless of persistence, 99% of bots sent
pieces of spam to our domain over the entire trace.
fewer than 100
Most persistent bots sent fewer than 100 pieces of spam to our sink-
hole, indicating that typical rates of spam from Bobax drones, for
spam received by a single domain, are less than a single piece of
spam per bot per day.
6. Spam from Transient BGP Announcements
Many spam ﬁltering techniques leverage the ability to positively
identify a spammer by its IP address. For example, DNS blacklists
catalog the IP addresses of likely spammers so that spam ﬁlters
may later send queries to determine whether an email was sent by
a likely spammer. Of course, this technique implicitly assumes a
connection between an IP address and the physical infrastructure
that a spammer uses to distribute email. In this section, we study
the extent to which spammers use such transient identities by ex-
amining spam received by the sinkhole domain that coincides with
short-lived BGP route announcements.
Informal anecdotes have claimed that some spammers brieﬂy ad-
vertise portions of IP address space, send spam from mail relays
with IP addresses in that space, and subsequently withdraw the
routes for that space after the relays have sent spam [1, 28, 30]. This
practice makes it difﬁcult for end users and system administrators
to track spam sources because the network from which a piece of
spam was sent is likely to be unreachable at the time a user lodges
a complaint. Although it is technically possible to log BGP routing
announcements and mine them to perform post-mortem analysis,
the relative difﬁculty of doing so (especially since most network
operators do not monitor interdomain routes in real time) essen-
tially makes these spammers untraceable.
Little is known about (1) whether the technique is used much in
practice (and how widespread it is), (2) what IP space spammers
tend to use to mount these types of attacks and (3) the announce-
ment patterns of these attacks. This study seeks to answer two sets
of questions about the use of short-lived BGP routing announce-
ments for sending spam:
• Prevalence across ASes and persistence across time. How
many ASes use short-lived BGP routing announcements to
send spam? Which ASes are the most guilty, in terms of num-
ber of pieces of spam sent, and in terms of persistence across
time?
• Length of short-lived BGP announcements. How long do
short-lived BGP announcements last (i.e., long enough for
an operator to catch)?
As we will see, sending spam from IP address space correspond-
ing to short-lived route announcements is not, by any means, the
dominant technique that spam is sent today (when this technique
is actively being used, it accounts for no more than 10% of all
spam we receive, and it generally accounts for much less). Nev-
ertheless, because our domain only observes spamming behavior
from a single vantage point, this technique may be more common
than we are observing. Additionally, because this technique is not
well defended against today, and because it is complementary to
other spamming techniques (e.g., it could conceivably be used to
cloak botnets), we believe that this behavior is worth attention, par-
ticularly since some of the techniques we observe (i.e., hijacking
large preﬁxes) represents a signiﬁcant departure from conventional
wisdom on preﬁx hijacking.
6.1 BGP Spectrum Agility
Figure 9 shows an example of 61.0.0.0/8 being announced
by AS 4678 for a brief period of time on September 30, 2005, dur-
ing which spam was also sent from IP addresses contained within
this preﬁx.
To investigate further the extent to which this technique is used
in practice, we performed a joint analysis of BGP routing data (de-
scribed in Section 3.4) and the spam received at our sinkhole, which
is co-located with the BGP monitor. Given the sophistication re-
quired to send spam under the protection of short-lived routing an-
nouncements (especially compared with the relative simplicity of
purchasing access to a botnet), we doubted that it was particularly
prevalent. To our surprise, a small number of parties appear to be
