**Subject: Resolving the 'python35_d.lib' Missing Error on Windows 7 with Python 3.5 and C Main Program**

I have installed Python 3.5 on my Windows 7 Home Premium (version 6.1) and am attempting to use a C main program that leverages Python library extensions. I have added the paths to the `include` and `library` folders to the Dev Studio C-compiler. However, when testing with a provided sample program that prints the current time, I encounter a compilation error. The compiler can locate `Python.h`, but it fails to find `python35_d.lib`. I have also been unable to locate this file.

Is `python35_d.lib` missing from the Python 3.5 download, or is it named differently in the downloaded package? 

**Solution:**

After some investigation, I found a workaround for the missing `python3x_d.lib` issue. When installing Python using `pythoninstaller.exe`, follow these steps:

1. **Choose Advanced Setup Options:** During the installation process, select the "Advanced setup options" in the first command window of the installation wizard.
2. **Download Debug Binaries:** In the advanced setup options, enable the "Download debug binaries" option. This will ensure that the `python3x_d.lib` file is included in the installation.

I encountered this error while trying to build OpenCV with Python bindings, and this solution resolved the issue.

Thank you for your assistance.
