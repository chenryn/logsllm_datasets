To enhance security and accountability, it is essential to ensure that any accounts used by third-party providers for system access are uniquely traceable to the specific provider. These accounts should not be shared across the network or with other third-party providers operating in the same environment. Regular reviews of these provisioned accounts should be conducted to verify their ongoing business necessity. Additionally, there should be a robust governance framework in place to manage the de-provisioning of access that is no longer required.

Furthermore, critical network systems should be protected through proper system and access isolation. This can be achieved by implementing account privilege separation, ensuring that only necessary permissions are granted and minimizing the potential impact of a compromised account.
