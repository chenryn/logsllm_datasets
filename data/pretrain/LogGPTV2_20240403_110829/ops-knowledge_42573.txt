To extract the pattern "Animating brightness: target=38, rate=200" from the log, you can use the following template:

**Pattern:** `Animating brightness: target=<*>, rate=<*>`

This template will help you identify and match similar patterns in the log, where `<*>` represents variable values for the target and rate.
