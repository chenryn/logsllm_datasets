By default, alt-f is bound to `editor:move-to-end-of-word` and alt-h to
`editor:delete-to-beginning-of-word`. These conflict with activating `File`
and `Help` menus in Windows.
Suggestions:
  * Reserve alt-f and alt-h for menu bar access and change editor shortcuts.
  * Focus and activate menu bar via a single alt press so user can navigate through the menus using arrow keys (customary behavior in Windows).
