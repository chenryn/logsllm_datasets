The Map-Coloring Problem
Question: How many colors are required to color a map of the
United States so that no two adjacent regions are given the same
color?
Answer: Four colors are enough. Three are not enough.
The Four-Color Problem: Is there some map that requires five
colors?
In order to give a negative answer, you have to show that every
map — no matter how cleverly constructed — can be colored with
4 or fewer colors.

The History of the Four-Color Theorem
1852: Student Francis Guthrie notices that four colors suffice to
color a map of the counties of England.
Guthrie poses the Four-Color Problem to his brother Frederick, a
student of Augustus De Morgan (a big shot of 19th-century British
mathematics).
De Morgan likes the problem and mentions it to others.

The History of the Four-Color Theorem
 1879: Alfred Kempe proves the Four-Color Theorem (4CT):
Four colors suffice to color any map.
 1880: Peter Tait finds another proof.
That was that.
 1890: Percy John Heawood shows that Kempe’s proof was
wrong.
 1891: Julius Petersen shows that Tait’s proof was wrong.
 20th century: Many failed attempts to (dis)prove the 4CT.
Some lead to interesting discoveries; many don’t.

Mathematician H.S.M. Coxeter:
Almost every mathematician must have experienced one
glorious night when he thought he had discovered a
proof, only to find in the morning that he had fallen into
a similar trap.
Mathematician Underwood Dudley:
The four-color conjecture was easy to state and easy to
understand, no large amount of technical mathematics is
needed to attack it, and errors in proposed proofs are
hard to see, even for professionals; what an ideal
combination to attract cranks!

The History of the Four-Color Theorem
 1976: Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken prove the 4CT.
Their proof relies on checking a large number of cases by
computer, sparking ongoing debate over what a proof really is.
 1997: N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, P.D. Seymour, and R.
Thomas improve Appel and Haken’s methods to reduce the
number of cases (but still rely on computer assistance).
 2005: Georges Gonthier publishes a “formal proof”
(automating not just the case-checking, but the proof process
itself).

Example: You are a kindergarten teacher. You want to assign each
child a table to sit at. However, there are certain pairs of kids who
shouldn’t sit together.
How many tables are you going to need?
This is a graph theory problem!
vertices = children
edges = pairs of kids to keep separate
colors = tables

Graph Coloring and the Chromatic Number
A proper coloring of G is an assignment of colors to the vertices of
G such that every two vertices connected by an edge must receive
different colors.
The chromatic number χ(G) is the minimum number of colors
needed for a proper coloring.
Important Note: The chromatic number is not necessarily the
same as the maximum number of mutually connected vertices.
(For example, a graph can have chromatic number 3 even if it has
no triangles.)
The Four-Color Problem: Does every planar graph have
chromatic number 4 or less?

Consider a graph whose vertices are a 9 × 9 grid of points.
Two vertices are joined by an edge if they are in the same row,
column, or 3 × 3 subregion.

You are given a partial proper coloring and told to extend it to all

Interlude: What Is A Proof?
 What is a mathematical proof?
— A logical argument that relies on commonly accepted axioms
and rules of inference (e.g., “if a = b and b = c, then a = c”).
 When is a proof correct?
— The standard of proof is very high in mathematics (not just
“beyond a reasonable doubt”, but beyond any doubt)
 Who gets to decide whether a proof is correct?
 Are some proofs better than others?

Theorem (Euler’s Formula)
Let G be any planar graph.
Let v, e, f denote the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces,
respectively.
Then,

Euler’s Formula: The “Raging Sea” Proof
 Each time a dike breaks, the raging sea rushes into one of the
fields, and there is one fewer field than before.
 Finally, the raging sea has overwhelmed all of the enclosed
areas — the graph has only one face
 There are still some dikes left, but they’re now just piers
extending into the sea.
 One by one, the network of piers shrinks.

Euler’s Formula: The “Raging Sea” Proof
 After all the dikes (= edges) are gone,
v = 1, e = 0, f = 1, v − e + f = 2.
 Each time a dike disappeared, either f or v decreased by 1.
 Therefore, the value of v − e + f never changed — it must
always have been 2!
 This logic works no matter what the original graph was — so
we have proved Euler’s formula for all planar graphs.

Proofs and The Book
Most mathematicians would call this proof “beautiful” or a “proof
from the Book” — it is a simple and elegant proof of an extremely
important theorem.
The mathematician Paul Erd˝os spoke of “The Book,” in which
God records the best and most beautiful proofs of mathematical
theorems. Once in a while, a mortal is allowed a glimpse of the
Book. Erd˝os said:
“You don’t have to believe in God, but you should
believe in the Book.”
