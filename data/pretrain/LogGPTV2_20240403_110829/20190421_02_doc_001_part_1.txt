## 1. The Four-Color Theorem: Graphs and Coloring Maps

### 1.1 The Map-Coloring Problem
**Question:** How many colors are required to color a map of the United States so that no two adjacent regions share the same color?

**Answer:** Four colors are sufficient. Three colors are not enough.

**Four-Color Problem:** Is there any map that requires five colors?

To answer negatively, one must show that every map, regardless of its construction, can be colored with four or fewer colors.

## 2. The History of the Four-Color Theorem

### 2.1 Early Developments
- **1852:** Francis Guthrie, a student, notices that four colors suffice to color a map of the counties of England.
- **Guthrie's Brother Frederick** (a student of Augustus De Morgan) poses the problem to De Morgan.
- **De Morgan** finds the problem intriguing and shares it with others.

### 2.2 Initial Proofs and Disproofs
- **1879:** Alfred Kempe claims to prove the Four-Color Theorem (4CT): Four colors are sufficient for any map.
- **1880:** Peter Tait provides another proof.
- **1890:** Percy John Heawood shows that Kempe’s proof is incorrect.
- **1891:** Julius Petersen demonstrates that Tait’s proof is also flawed.

### 2.3 20th Century Developments
- Many failed attempts to (dis)prove the 4CT, leading to some interesting discoveries but also many dead ends.
- **H.S.M. Coxeter:** "Almost every mathematician must have experienced one glorious night when he thought he had discovered a proof, only to find in the morning that he had fallen into a similar trap."
- **Underwood Dudley:** "The four-color conjecture was easy to state and easy to understand, no large amount of technical mathematics is needed to attack it, and errors in proposed proofs are hard to see, even for professionals; what an ideal combination to attract cranks!"

### 2.4 Modern Proofs
- **1976:** Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken use a computer to check a large number of cases, proving the 4CT. This sparks a debate on the nature of mathematical proof.
- **1997:** N. Robertson, D.P. Sanders, P.D. Seymour, and R. Thomas improve Appel and Haken’s methods, reducing the number of cases but still relying on computer assistance.
- **2005:** Georges Gonthier publishes a "formal proof," automating both the case-checking and the proof process itself.

## 3. Definitions and Examples

### 3.1 Graphs
- A graph consists of a collection of vertices connected by edges.
- **Vertices and Edges:** Do not have to be points and curves. For example:
  - **Facebook:** Vertices = people, Edges = friendships
  - **WWW:** Vertices = web pages, Edges = links
  - **Chess:** Vertices = positions, Edges = possible moves

### 3.2 Planar Graphs
- A graph is planar if its vertices and edges can be drawn as points and line segments with no crossings.
- **Example:**
  - (a) Planar
  - (b) Planar (same graph as (a))
  - (c) Not planar

### 3.3 Graphs from Maps
- Every map can be modeled as a planar graph.
  - **Vertices:** Represent regions.
  - **Edges:** Represent common borders.

### 3.4 Graph Coloring
- **Example:** You are a kindergarten teacher and want to assign each child a table to sit at, but certain pairs of kids should not sit together.
  - **Vertices:** Children
  - **Edges:** Pairs of kids to keep separate
  - **Colors:** Tables

### 3.5 Graph Coloring and the Chromatic Number
- A proper coloring of a graph \( G \) assigns colors to the vertices such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
- **Chromatic Number \( \chi(G) \):** The minimum number of colors needed for a proper coloring.
- **Important Note:** The chromatic number is not necessarily the same as the maximum number of mutually connected vertices.
- **Four-Color Problem:** Does every planar graph have a chromatic number of 4 or less?

### 3.6 Examples of Chromatic Numbers
- Various graphs with different chromatic numbers are shown.

### 3.7 Graph Coloring and Sudoku
- Consider a graph whose vertices are a 9 × 9 grid of points.
- Two vertices are joined by an edge if they are in the same row, column, or 3 × 3 subregion.
- This setup is analogous to a Sudoku puzzle.

## 4. Interlude: What Is a Proof?

- **Mathematical Proof:** A logical argument based on commonly accepted axioms and rules of inference.
- **Correctness of a Proof:** The standard is very high in mathematics, requiring absolute certainty.
- **Deciding Correctness:** Mathematicians collectively decide the correctness of a proof.
- **Quality of Proofs:** Some proofs are more elegant and insightful than others.

## 5. Back to Graph Theory: Faces of Planar Graphs

- Planar graphs have faces, which are the areas between the edges.
- **Euler’s Formula:** For any planar graph \( G \), let \( v \), \( e \), and \( f \) denote the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces, respectively. Then, \( v - e + f = 2 \).

### 5.1 Euler’s Formula: The “Raging Sea” Proof
- **Imagery:** Imagine the edges as dikes holding back the sea from fields.
- **Process:**
  - Each time a dike breaks, the sea rushes into a field, reducing the number of fields.
  - Eventually, all fields are overwhelmed, and the graph has only one face.
  - The remaining dikes become piers extending into the sea, and the network of piers shrinks.
- **Conclusion:** The value of \( v - e + f \) remains constant throughout this process, always equaling 2.

### 5.2 Proofs and The Book
- **Paul Erdős:** Spoke of “The Book,” where God records the best and most beautiful proofs.
- **Erdős Quote:** "You don’t have to believe in God, but you should believe in the Book."
