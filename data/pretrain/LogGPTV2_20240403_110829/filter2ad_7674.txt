ABSTRACT 
This  talk  will  provide  a  perspective  on  attribute-based  access 
control  (ABAC).  The  ongoing  authorization  leap  from  rights  to 
attributes  offers  numerous  compelling  benefits.  Decisions  about 
user, subject, object and context attributes can be made relatively 
independently  and  with  suitable  decentralization  appropriate  for 
each attribute. Policies can be formulated by security architects to 
translate from attributes to rights. Dynamic elements can be built 
into  these  policies  so  the  outcomes  of  access  control  decisions 
automatically  adapt  to  changing  local  and  global  circumstances. 
On  the  benefits  side  this  leap  is  a  maturation  of  authorization 
matching the needs of emerging cyber technologies and systems. 
On  the  risks  side  devolving  attribute  management  may  lead  to 
attributes  of  questionable  provenance  and  value,  with  attendant 
possibility  of  new  channels  for  social  engineering  and  malware 
attacks. We argue that the potential benefits will lead to pervasive 
deployment of attribute-based access control, and more generally 
attribute-based  security.  The  cyber  security  research  community 
has  a  responsibility  to  develop  models,  theories  and  systems 
which enable safe and chaos-free deployment of ABAC. This is a 
current grand challenge.

BIO 
Ravi  Sandhu  is  Executive  Director  of  the  Institute  for  Cyber 
Security  at  the  University  of  Texas  at  San  Antonio,  where  he 
holds  the  Lutcher  Brown  Endowed  Chair  in  Cyber  Security. 
Previously he served on the faculty at George Mason University 
(1989-2007)  and  Ohio  State  University  (1982-1989).  He  holds 
BTech and MTech degrees from IIT Bombay and Delhi, and MS 
and  PhD  degrees  from  Rutgers  University.  He  is  a  Fellow  of 
IEEE,  ACM  and  AAAS,  and  has  received  awards  from  IEEE, 
ACM,  NSA  and  NIST.  A  prolific  and  highly  cited  author,  his 
research has been funded by NSF, NSA, NIST, DARPA, AFOSR, 
ONR,  AFRL  and  private  industry.  His  seminal  papers  on  role-
based access control established it as the dominant form of access 
control  in  practical  systems.  His  numerous  other  models  and 
mechanisms  have  also  had  considerable  real-world  impact.  He 
served  as  Editor-in-Chief  of 
IEEE  Transactions  on 
Dependable  and  Secure  Computing,  and  previously  as  founding 
Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Information and System 
Security.  He  was  Chairman  of  ACM  SIGSAC,  and  founded  the 
ACM  Conference  on  Computer  and  Communications  Security, 
the  ACM  Symposium  on  Access  Control  Models  and 
Technologies, and the ACM Conference on Data and Application 
Security  and  Privacy.  He  has  served  as  General  Chair,  Steering 
Committee  Chair,  Program  Chair  and  Committee  Member  for 
numerous  security  conferences.  He  has  consulted  for  leading 
industry and government organizations, and has lectured all over 
the world. He is an inventor on 30 security technology patents and 
has  accumulated  over  28,000  Google  Scholar  citations  for  his 
papers.  At  the  Institute  for  Cyber  Security  his  research  projects 
include  attribute-based  access  control,  secure  cloud  computing, 
secure information sharing, social computing security, and secure 
data provenance.
