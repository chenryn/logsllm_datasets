User: How to design an efficient caching strategy to reduce the burden on the database?
Assistant: 1. Cache data analysis: determine which data needs to be cached, which data is not suitable for caching, which are frequently read, and which are rarely read. 2. Cache data update strategy: When the data is modified, update the cache or delete the cache to avoid the generation of dirty data. 3. Cache data expiration strategy: Set the expiration time of the cache data, and read the data from the database again when the cache expires. 4. Cache technology selection: Choose an efficient cache technology, such as Redis, Memcache, etc. 5. Cache capacity control: Control the size of the cache space to avoid the cache occupying too much memory and increasing the burden on the database. 6. Cache cleaning strategy: Regularly clean out expired and infrequently used cache data to avoid the cache from taking up too much memory. 7. Stress test: Carry out cache efficiency and load tests in the actual environment to confirm the effectiveness of the cache strategy.
