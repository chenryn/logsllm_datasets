Subject: Assistance Needed with TensorFlow Installation and Error Resolution on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Dear Community,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently facing challenges while attempting to set up TensorFlow on my system, which is running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. My journey began when I tried executing a sample code obtained directly from the official TensorFlow website. Unfortunately, after a prolonged processing time, the execution resulted in several errors (screenshot attached for reference).

In an attempt to resolve the issue, I proceeded to install TensorFlow from its source code. Regrettably, this approach also led to multiple errors, preventing a successful installation. As a result, I decided to completely remove all previously installed TensorFlow components and start afresh. However, even after reinstalling TensorFlow, the same set of errors persists.

Given that I am relatively new to TensorFlow and have been struggling with this problem for nearly two months now, any guidance or assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. This situation has become quite urgent for me, and I am eager to overcome this hurdle so that I may continue my learning journey.

Thank you very much in advance for your time and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
