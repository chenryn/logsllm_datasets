User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the storage.BlockManager finding five blocks (rdd_2_0 - rdd_2_4) locally, the python.PythonRunner calculating times for each task, and the executor.Executor and executor.CoarseGrainedExecutorBackend assigning and running tasks.
