Lemma 49: From game G3 to game G4
There exists an adversary B3 such that:
|AdvG3(A) − AdvG4(A)| ≤ 2 · Adv3-PDDH
PG,B2 (λ) + 2−Ω(λ).
Here, we change the distribution of the challenge ciphertext, using the 3-PDDH assumption,
as for Lemma 47.
Proof of Lemma 49. Upon receiving a 3-PDDH challenge (PG, [a]1, [b]2, [c]1, [c]2, [z]1) (see Def-
inition 15), and the challenge messages (x(0), y(0)), (x(1), y(1)), B1 samples A, B ←R Dk;

B2 computes [c0]1 := [γ]1, [bc0]2 := [γ]2, gpk := PG, and ct := {[c0]1, [bc0]2, [ci]1, [bcj]2}i∈[2n],j∈[2m].
It returns (gpk, pk, ct) to A.
Then, it simulates OKeygen as in G4 (see Figure 7.7). Finally, if A outputs β′, B2 outputs
1 if β′ = β, and 0 otherwise.
It can be seen that when [z]1 is a real 3-PDDH challenge, i.e., [z]1 = [abc]1, then B3
simulates game G4; whereas it simulates game G3 when [z]1 ←R G1. In particular, while this
is easy to see for the elements of the public key and for ciphertexts [bcj]2, [bcm+j]2, for the
ciphertext elements [ci]1, [cn+i]1 we observe that they can be written as
ci :=
cn+i :=

So, if z = abc, then zb−1 = aγ and the ciphertexts are distributed as in G4; otherwise, if
z is random, zb−1 is identically distributed to (aγ + v) as in G3. This proves |AdvG3(A) −
AdvG4(A)| ≤ Adv3-PDDH
PG,B3 (λ) + 2−Ω(λ).

Chapter 7. Functional Encryption for Quadratic Functions
Proof of Lemma 50. This transition is symmetric to that between G0 and G1: we use the
selective, single-ciphertext security of the underlying private-key scheme (in Figure 7.2), to

i b⊥]1, [Arn+i − x(0)
switch: {[Ari + x(β)
j a⊥]2}i∈[n],j∈[m] to
{[Ari]1, [Bsj]2}i∈[2n],j∈[2m], since x(β)⊤
j = 0, by deﬁnition of the security game.
Thus, by Theorem 19 (one-SEL-IND security of FEone), we obtain the lemma.
