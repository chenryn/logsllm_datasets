The Collapse component's `onEntered` prop is not destructured in the render
method. So the `onEntered` prop is spread into the Transition component
through `...other`, thereby overwriting the Collapse components
`this.handleEntered` method as the `onEntered` prop to Transition. So
`this.handleEntered` is never invoked.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
`onEntered` should be destructured out of `this.props` so it is not included
in `...other`. Collapse `handleEntered` method should get invoked.
## Current Behavior
Collapse `handleEntered` method is never invoked.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Try to `console.log` something in Collapse `handleEntered` method and it will
not log.
      render() {
        const {
          children,
          classes,
          onEnter,
          onEntering, // 
## Context
I was trying to invoke a call back that helps measure dom elements in Collapse
`onEntered`. I realized it was not being called in the Collapse method because
the `element` did not have the style values that are assigned in that method.
