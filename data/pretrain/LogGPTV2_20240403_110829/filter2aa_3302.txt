Roadmap
●
Choosing a platform
●
Selecting a base OS
●
Building a base system
●
The easy part – leveraging repositories
●
The slightly harder part – building tools
●
Building your own accessories
●
Solo Demonstrations
●
Networking with 802.15.4
●
Attack Networks
●
Future directions
Choosing a Platform
● Small
● Low-power
● Affordable
● Mature
● Networking built in
● Good USB support
● Convenient input and output
And the Winning Platform is...
● Beagleboard-xM/BeagleBone Black
–
3.25” square/ 3.4” x 2.1”
–
-armv7a...”
●
Untar toolchain “tar -xf angstrom--armv7a-linux-gnueabi-
toolchain.tar.bz2 -C”
●
Setup build environment “. /usr/local/angstrom/arm/environment-setup”
●
Download source
●
Configure with “./configure --host=arm-angstrom-linux-gnueabi –
prefix=/home/...”
●
Build with “make && sudo make install”
●
Copy binaries to BB-xM
●
Could have problems if there is a kernel mismatch between setup and what 
is installed to BB-xM
Cross-Compile Method 2
●
Install a toolchain as in Method 1
●
Install Eclipse
●
Install C/C++ Development Tools in Eclipse
●
Download software
●
Use makefile to create Eclipse project
●
Create a Build Configuration in Eclipse
●
Compile
●
Move binaries to BB-xM
Cross-Compile Method 3
● Same as Method 2, but with the addition of remote 
debugging
● Has advantage of easy transfer of binaries
● In Eclipse under Mobile Development add
– C/C++ DSF GDB Debugger Integration
– C/C++ Remote Launch
– Remote System Explorer End-User Runtime
– Remote System Explorer User Actions
● Great tutorial by Jan Axelson at

Building Your Own Hardware Accessories
Power Your Drones
● Beagles take standard 2.1 x 5.5 mm barrel connector
● Battery voltage above 5V is wasted as heat
● Bare board can run for several days off standard batteries
● LCD touchscreens require lots of power!
● Leaching off of USB power from a target is ideal
● Be careful with WiFi and 802.15.4
● Set transmit power to minimum
● Take advantage of sleep modes on 802.15.4 radios

802.15.4 Networking
● Basics
● Hardware
● Simple case: 2 Xbee adapters
● Slightly harder case: multiple adapters 
one at a time
● Hard case: multiple adapters 
simultaneously
● Really Hard case: true mesh network
802.15.4 Basics
● Typically used in low-power embedded 
systems
● Regular (100') and Pro (1 mi) versions 
● AT and API modes of operation
● Low-speed (250 kbps max)
● Supports multiple network topologies
– Peer to Peer
– Star
– Mesh
Xbee Hardware
● Manufactured by Digi
● Regular and Pro formats are interchangeable and interoperable
● Uses 2 mm pin spacing
– Most breadboards are 0.1” or 2.54 mm
– Requires an adapter
● Several antenna options
● Be careful not to use S2 or ZB series which are the same dimensions, but are not 
compatible
Xbee Adapters
● UART (serial) adapters
– Can be wired directly to Beagles using 4 wires
– Don't take up USB ports
Xbee Adapters (contd)
● USB Adapters
– More expensive
– Helpful for initial setup
– Easier to setup: just plug it in
Simple Case: 2 Xbee Adapters
● Xbee modules must be configured for 
desired network topology
● Digi provides X-CTU software for 
configuration, but it only runs on Windows
● Recently Moltosenso has released Network 
Manager IRON 1.0 which runs on Linux, Mac, 
and Windows – free edition is sufficient for 
our limited usage
Configuring Xbee Modules
● Place Xbee module in USB adapter and connect to PC running X-CTU or IRON
● Select correct USB port and set baud rate (default is 9600)
● From Modem Configuration tab select Read to get current configuration
● Ensure modem is XB24 and Function Set is XBEE 802.15.4
● Set the channel and PAN ID (1337?) noting the settings which must be the 
same for all modems
● Pick a Destination Low and Destination High address for the other adapter (say 
2 and 0)
● Set the My Address to a chosen value (say 01)
● Click Write to stored the new config on the Xbee
● Repeat this process on the second Xbee but reverse the addresses
● The modules should now talk to each other just fine
Wiring the Xbee to Beagles
If you splurged for the USB adapter you 
can just plug in to a USB port
– BeagleBone has only 1 USB port which you might 
want for something else
– BeagleBoard has 4 USB ports 
● Using the UART interface slightly more 
complicated
– Connect 4 wires: 3.3V, Ground, TX, RX
– Configure the Beagle multiplexer for proper operation
Setting up a UART Interface
● Appropriate pins & modes in Beagle manuals
● For BeagleBone UART2
– 3.3V & Ground  P9 pin 3 & 1, respectively
– TX P9 pin 21 (to Xbee Din)
– RX P9 pin 22 (to Xbee Dout)
– Configure BeagleBone (White not black
● echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/omap_mux/spi0_d0
● echo 21 > /sys/kernel/debug/omap_mux/spi0_sclk
– BBB uses new kernel – see my blog for details
– Test connection by connecting terminal program to /dev/ttyO2 (not a zero)
● Recommend against using UART on BeagleBoard
– 1.8V logic levels requires level shifting
– Slightly more complicated software configuration
Simple Case: Accessing your single drone
● By default Xbee adapters operate in 
transparent mode
● Setup TTY on drone and you can login 
in with terminal program
– Simple
– Works with interactive programs
– If you go out of range you are still connected 
when you return
Slightly Harder Case: Multiple Drones One at a Time
● Configure drones as with the single drone case but 
with different MY addresses
● Use terminal program on command console to 
connect to drones one at a time
● Simple: no programming required
● Must enter AT command mode to switch between 
drones
– Enter “+++” (no enter) and wait for OK
– Enter “ATDL0002 ” to select drone 2
– Enter “ATWR ” to write to NVRAM
– Enter “ATCN ” to exit command mode
Trivial example of Two Drones in TTY Mode
Slightly Harder Case: Multiple Drones Simultaneously
● API mode is used vs. AT mode
● Configure Xbee with X-CTU
– For Series 1 stick with 802.15.4 Function Set
– For Series 2 (ZB)
● Drones set to Function Set ZNET 2.5 ROUTER/ENDDEVICE API 1347
● Controller set to Function Set ZNET 2.5 COORDINATOR API 1147
● Multiple choices for communication
– Java xbee-api
– Python-xbee (what I used)
– Raw commands to TTY device
● Recommended for most situations involving 3 or more 
devices 
Multiple Drone Communications
● Really this is a point-to-multipoint 
topology
● For each drone communication 
appears to be simple peer-to-peer
● API mode provides better 
performance and allows simpler 
software operation
Multiple Drones Using Python: One Possibility 
● Each drone runs a simple Python script which waits for 
commands and sends announcements
● Controller listens for announcements/responses and sends 
commands (all activity is logged)
● Upside is that it lends itself easily to scripting
● Downside is that it doesn't support interactive shells (yet)
● Announcements can be sent to controller for important events 
(such as successful cracking)
● Code is available at http://polstra.org
Trivial Example with Two Drone – API Mode Using Python
Python Mode (continued)
Python Mode (continued)
Python Mode (continued)
Harder Case: True Mesh Network
● Only recommended when larger 
number of drones or when devices 
are too far apart
● Will negatively impact battery life
● Requires series 2 (aka ZB) Xbee 
adapters
● No changes to scripts are required
Networked attacks – Simplest Case
● In the simplest case there is only 1 drone
● Networking is peer-to-peer
● Allows hacking from a distance
– Better WiFi hacking when drone is in building
– Drone runs 24x7
– Drone can run for days off battery
– Important updates such as successfully cracked passwords can be sent to 
master periodically in case you weren't in range when they happened
– Drone has full version of The Deck – lots of possibilities
– Less conspicuous than sitting outside the building
– If you are lucky you can patch into wired network
– If you are extra lucky they use Power Over Ethernet!
Networked Attack with Multiple Drones
● One process on master monitors status 
updates from all drones
● Interactive shell into each drone
– Multiple subshells can be created
– Processing continues if master disconnects
● Endless possibilities since each drone has 
full version of The Deck
● Drone are easily retasked based on 
objectives achieved by other drones
Future Directions
● Continue to add useful packages as need arises
● Optimize some packages for BB-xM/BBB
● Other output devices
● Exploit USB OTG functionality
● Make The Deck fly (literally) – September 12th
● Hack over the Internet with 802.15.4 gateway
