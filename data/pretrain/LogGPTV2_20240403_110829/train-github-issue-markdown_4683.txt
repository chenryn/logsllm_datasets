# Changes
I wrote a small script to import Terminal color schemes from VSCode themes.
However, there's something I think is unintended design:
The "cursorColor" setting is currently part of the profile, not the color
scheme. In my opinion it doesn't make sense, because by changing the color
scheme of a given profile, the background color may be similar to the cursor
color. Both settings should be coupled to each other for consistency.
# Additional features
It'd be amazing if you guys could implement the few remaining color
customization options from VSCode's terminal to reach feature parity. They
are:
  * terminal.border: The color of the border that separates split panes within the terminal.
  * terminal.selectionBackground: The selection background color of the terminal.
  * terminalCursor.background: The background color of the terminal cursor. Allows customizing the color of a character overlapped by a block cursor.
