#### Summary
The `AxiosRequestConfig` type is not broad enough for some use cases. For
example, when using `retry-axios`, a custom key by the name of `raxConfig` is
set in the `AxiosRequestConfig` argument. TS will rightfully report that
`raxConfig` doesn't match any type in `AxiosRequestConfig`.
#### Context
  * axios version: latest
  * Environment: N/A
I think the most straightforward way to fix this would be to simply add `[key:
string]: any` to the `AxiosRequestConfig` interface. What are your thoughts
