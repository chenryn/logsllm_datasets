User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题My bank support just asked me for my online banking credentials As title says, I was asked for my online banking password while on the process of getting in touch with a real person. This is something I'd never do and knowing that the call was being recorded (for further improvement of the bot I was talking to) makes it even worse.

For sure, after that, I hung up and I'm pretty sure it is a violation of privacy as you are asked for private details and also it is not encrypted whatsoever.


Have anyone been asked for this before?
Is this a normal practice?   
After saying my ID number, the bot refered to me as "Mr. my_last_name" so I guess it is a legit phone number but, could they been hacked and the support number hijacked?
Should I take any actions?

Assistant: Assuming that you called them on a published number, I'd say that this sounds like it was an interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, which is pretty common in the banking world.  

The concept is that the system takes your authentication information before passing you on to a contact centre agent.  The benefit of this from a security perspective is that then the agent in the call centre doesn't have to ask you to authenticate yourself, before discussing your account.

If correctly implemented this should be no more insecure than typing your password into a website.  There is an automated system processing the voice data and it should store/log this appropriately.

Of course as you point out there is the risk of phone tapping, but then if you assume that your phone line is tapped, any form of phone banking is insecure as they've got to authenticate you somehow to be able to discuss your account with you.

EDIT: To add some more details, rather than leave them scattered around comments that could get cleared.

Basically banks have to authenticate you somehow, no matter which channel (e.g. web, phone, branch) you use to contact them, and there are trade-offs to be considered.

On the one hand having dedicated credentials per channel is useful in that it reduce the risk of compromise, and avoids muddying the message of "don't tell people your web password" but it leaves users with more credentials to manage and in all likelihood a lot of password resets if users only use a specific channel rarely (with all the vulnerabilities that frequent resets attract)

So the option that it appears, from the information provided, that's used here is to combine the credentials for the web and phone channels, and to use an automated IVR system on the phone channel to avoid credentials being given to contact centre agents.  The upside here is single set of creds, so user's won't forget them, and the downside is the scenario we see where bank messaging "don't give people your password" leads to problems in using this system.

In terms of the IVR system security, this is essentially like any other system that processes data. It needs to be secured appropriately so that user credentials are not exposed, no different than the web channel.

Obviously a system like hardware (not SMS) 2FA could work well in this scenario as numeric codes are easily passed to IVR systems, but that has it's own tradeoffs in terms of cost and user experience.
