I have a page with url denied in server.js (I should see the content of the
_error page instead of the original "post.js" content), but when I access this
url, the _error content is almost instantly rerendered by the original
"post.js" content. Is there any way how to avoid this strange behavior?
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
After visitng localhost:3000/post url without additional parameter the server
should post content of the custom _error.js page. (This behavior is standart
in next v. 3.0.1)
## Current Behavior
The _error page is loaded, but almost instantly rerendered with post.js
content. This behavior happens on next v. 3.0.2 and later.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Download or clone this repo https://github.com/josefkrajkar/custom-express-server
  2. Install dependencies `npm install`
  3. Run the dev server with command `npm run dev`
  4. Visit the `localhost:3000/post` in your browser
