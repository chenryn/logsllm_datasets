ABSTRACT
A recent trend to mitigate large-scale distributed denial-of-service
(DDoS) attacks is in-network filtering, where victims can deploy
traffic-filtering rules in networks other than their own. However,
given multiple constraints, such as the number of rules a victim
can afford to deploy, the set of rules that DDoS defense entities
allow a victim to deploy, and the amount of collateral damage to
limit, the selection of rules has a large impact on the efficacy of an
in-network filtering solution.
In this paper, we introduce a new, offer-based operational model
for in-network DDoS defense and formulate the N P -hard rule selec-
tion problem for this model. We then design an algorithm that over-
comes the fundamental limitations of the classical ACO framework
and transform it with several key changes to make it applicable
to the domain of in-network DDoS defense. Finally, we use a real-
world Internet routing topology and two real-world DDoS traces,
along with one synthetic trace that follows the attack distribution of
the recent Mirai DDoS attack, to evaluate the efficacy and runtime
of our algorithm against four other rule selection algorithms, and
show our algorithm is near-optimal.

filtering. Once a DDoS attack has been detected, the victim (or
an entity acting on behalf of the victim), which we call the DDoS
defense agent (or simply, defense agent), generates DDoS-filtering
rules and places them at DDoS-filtering networks, which can be
scrubbing centers or strategically located transit networks between
the sources and victim that use the rules to filter DDoS traffic.
We focus on the offer-based operational model for in-network
DDoS filtering. Every in-network filtering solution we surveyed
assumes DDoS-filtering networks are ready to accept and execute
arbitrary DDoS-filtering rules dispatched to them, which is not the
case in the real-world. However, in the offer-based model, each
DDoS-filtering network inspects candidate rules that the defense
agent needs to deploy and makes one or multiple offers, where each
offer is a subset of rules that the filtering network is willing and
able to deploy. The defense agent then inspects all the offers from
all the filtering networks and accepts certain offers, where rules
in every accepted offer will then be placed at the filtering network
that made the offer. With this model, DDoS-filtering networks have
complete autonomy on which, what types of, and how many rules
to be deployed in their networks. This autonomy is particularly
useful in avoiding rule overflow troubles when a filtering network
receives more rules than it can afford to deploy. Furthermore, the
process of DDoS-filtering networks making offers eliminates the
defense agent’s burden of deciding or verifying, for every rule,
which DDoS-filtering networks can deploy the rule.
A problem at the center of the offer-based in-network defense
model is that the defense agent needs to decide which offer(s) to
take. Given every offer is composed of DDoS-filtering rules, we call
this problem the rule selection problem. The optimal solution
to this problem is to maximize the amount of DDoS traffic to be
filtered, with two main constraints: (1) assuming every filtering
network places a price on every offer it makes, the total price of the
offers finally selected must be within the defense agent’s budget;
and (2) assuming every rule has an associated collateral damage,
or the amount of legitimate traffic that may be filtered due to the
rule, the total collateral damage from all the selected rules must be
within a certain limit.
At first glance, this problem is similar to the classic N P -complete
0-1 multidimensional knapsack problem, which is to place items
into a knapsack to maximize the total value of items in the knapsack,
while the total weight of the items does not break the knapsack.
Here, we want to maximize the volume of DDoS traffic that all the
rules in selected offers can filter, while still meeting the aforemen-
tioned constraints.
However, the rule selection problem has one key difference from
the knapsack problem: While the knapsack problem assumes the
items are independent, in the rule selection problem, offers may
overlap (i.e., the same rule may appear in more than one offer),

thus are not independent from each other. This difference makes
it completely infeasible to directly apply those approximate knap-
sack solutions, including the dynamic programming algorithm that
requires every offer to be exclusive with each other and the ant
colony optimization (ACO) framework that has the same require-
ment [17]. Specifically, with the ACO framework, selecting offers is
equivalent to selecting a path in a complete graph in which every
node is an offer of a set of rules, and to select an optimal set of
offers is to discover the path whose offers have the maximum total
amount of DDoS traffic filtered according to the rules in offers. A
basic principle here is that the traffic filtered by every rule should
be counted only once, even if the rule appears in more than one
offer on the path. However, the classical ACO framework violates
this basic principle as its path discovery does not take into account
the overlapping nature of offers.
In this paper, we inspect possible solutions and design a near-
optimal solution to the rule selection problem. In particular, we
make the following contributions:
• We introduce a new, offer-based operational model for in-
network DDoS defense and formulate the N P -hard rule se-
lection problem for this model. The offer-based model allows
a victim to express candidate rules to all participating DDoS
defense entities and every entity to decide which rules they
deploy.
• We design an algorithm that overcomes the fundamental
limitations of the classical ACO framework, by transforming
it with several key modifications to make it applicable to the
domain of in-network DDoS defense.
• We use a real-world Internet routing topology and two real-
world DDoS traces, along with one synthetic trace that fol-
lows the attack distribution of the recent Mirai DDoS at-
tack [11], to evaluate the efficacy and runtime of our algo-
rithm against four other rule selection algorithms, and show
our algorithm is near-optimal.
2 RELATED WORK
All of the in-network filtering solutions that we surveyed follow
what we call the directive-based model, in which each DDoS-filtering
network, given its filtering capabilities (i.e., number of routers ca-
pable of filtering traffic and amount of memory to deploy rules on
capable routers), are obliged to deploy filtering rules on behalf of
a defense agent [10, 12, 16, 22, 23, 28, 32, 34, 35, 38, 39, 42]. In the
directive-based model, in most cases, the defense agent does not
concern itself with rule selection because, as long as the filtering
capabilities at the DDoS-filtering networks are not exhausted, all
rules generated by the defense agent will be deployed at filtering
networks. As a result, the rule selection problem is not well studied
in these defense solutions.
Also as mentioned in Section 1, the problem of generating and
deploying rules is outside the scope of this paper, and are orthog-
onal to rule selection. Unlike the rule selection problem, the rule
generation and deployment problems are well studied. For example,
El Defrawy et al. [18], Soldo et al. [44], and Kallola et al. [26] present
dynamic programming, prefix tree-based, and hierarchical heavy
hitter (HHH) algorithms, respectively, for solving the rule gener-
ation problem at either single or multiple routers on the Internet.
Along with assuming that DDoS-filtering networks are willing and
able to deploy generated rules, these works also assume that the
defense agent has complete knowledge of the filtering capabilities
at the filtering networks. This is a strong assumption, since most
autonomous systems (ASes), or DDoS-filtering networks, would
treat their filtering capabilities as private and sensitive informa-
tion. Therefore, while the defense agent can leverage such works
to generate rules, it still needs to choose only a subset of rules
offered to be deployed at the filtering networks. Cooke et al. [15]
and Xu et al. [47] study and solve problems related to rule deploy-
ment, such as deployment of DDoS monitoring sensors and rules,
while Armbruster et al. [13] present a solution to the deployment
of traffic filtering rules for DDoS attacks that exploit IP spoofing.
Furthermore, Zhang et al. [50] present an adaptable rule deploy-
ment solution for Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). Due to the
fairly comprehensive research conducted on rule generation and
deployment, we instead focus our attention on rule selection. To
our knowledge, this work is the first to study this problem in depth.
Finally, although the rule selection problem is not a main fo-
cus for existing papers related to in-network DDoS defense, there
are papers in the domain of DDoS defense via cloud scrubbing
services that tackle similar optimization problems. For example,
Jiao et al. [25] determine DDoS traffic diversion and cloud resource
allocation under dynamic DDoS attacks, and You et al. [48] design
an online auction mechanism to incentivize DDoS-protection ser-
vice providers to collaboratively scrub DDoS traffic. The general
approach these papers take in solving their N P -hard optimization
problems is by regularizing the objective function and relaxing the
constraints to form a new problem solvable in polynomial time. In
future work, we plan on investigating the impact of such techniques
on the offer-based rule selection problem.
3 OFFER-BASED OPERATIONAL MODEL
3.1 Overview
The offer-based operational model, like other operational models,
allows the defense agent to express its filtering needs in any way
it sees fit. This means that the defense agent has the freedom to
choose from a plethora of mechanisms for filtering DDoS traffic,
including, but not limited to, access control lists (ACLs) [5], Re-
motely Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) signals [2, 14], BGP FlowSpec
rules [1], or SDN rules [37]. In this paper, we are not tied to a spe-
cific mechanism, but without losing generality we choose to focus
on filtering rules based on source IP prefixes (e.g., 162.243.141.0/24).
However, it is important to note that the algorithm presented in
this paper can be generalized to any other type of filtering rule. In
the following subsection, we detail the offer-based model for in-
network DDoS defense that allows victims to express their filtering
needs by deploying source IP prefix-based rules on networks other
than their own.
3.2 Operational Model
Fig. 1 shows an overview of the offer-based model. Once a DDoS
attack is detected, the mitigation process begins with the generation
of DDoS traffic filtering rules. In most cases, the victim of an attack
will generate these rules because it has the best vantage point
to observe its specific traffic patterns and the most knowledge

Figure 1: An overview of the offer-based model for in-
network DDoS filtering. The defense agent (victim) begins
by detecting the DDoS attack and generating rules to filter
the attack traffic (circle 1). It then sends those rules to the
DDoS-filtering networks, which create offers based on the
set of rules each are willing to deploy (circles 2). The filtering
networks then send the candidate offers back to the defense
agent, who selects the offers to be deployed (circle 3). After
the filtering networks of the selected offers are notified by
the defense agent, they deploy the rules that make up the se-
lected offers in their networks (circles 4), thus filtering DDoS
traffic on behalf of the victim.
on what traffic is desired and undesired (we will later discuss, in
subsection 5.5, a scenario when this may not be the case). For
generality, the defense agent is the entity that is generating rules.
Every rule will indicate how to filter DDoS traffic directed to the
victim of the DDoS attack (i.e., what attributes or packet fields to
use in order to differentiate attack traffic from legitimate traffic).
Note that rules can only affect the traffic targeted to the victimÐthe
destination IP address of the traffic being filtered must belong to the
victim’s network.
The defense agent then distributes these rules to the DDoS-
filtering networks (or defending networks) that may be willing to
deploy the rules. Each filtering network then decides which subsets
of rules it can deploy, given its limited filtering capabilities. A subset
of rules is called an offer, and each filtering network can provide
the defense agent with multiple offers. We leave the specifics of
offer generation to network operators/administrators.
Specifically, offers are made up of a set of rules, where each rule
filters a set of attack flows and, potentially, a set of flows that may
be legitimate (i.e., flows that are not attack flows). The value or
efficacy of an offer represents the total amount of attack traffic that
its rules can filter. Each offer also has two weights associated with
it: one weight represents the collateral damage of the offer (or the
total amount of legitimate traffic that its rules filter) and the other
weight is the cost of the offer. Note, that it does not make sense
for a single offer to be made up of rules that filter a shared subset
of attack flows (or legitimate flows). In other words, it is illogical
for an offer Q to include two rules r and s, where rule r filters
an IP prefix that is a subset of an IP prefix filtered by rule s. For

subset of traffic. Since rule s dominates rule r , only one of
these rules should be included in the same offer.
example, if s filters 56.0.0.0/16 (or all IP addresses between 56.0.0.0
and 56.0.255.255), and r filters 56.0.192.0/18 (or all IP addresses
between 56.0.192.0 and 56.0.255.255), s dominates r , and therefore
only one of them should belong to the same offer, as can be seen
in Fig. 2 (each block represents a DDoS filtering rule that filters
traffic from a specific IP range ś the four /18 rules are dominated
by the two /17 rules, which are in turn dominated by the single /16
rule). However, multiple separate offers can be made up of rules
that filter a shared subset of traffic flows, or even share the same
