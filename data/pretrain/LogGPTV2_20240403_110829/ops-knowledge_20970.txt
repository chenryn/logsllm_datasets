User: Is there a standard way to make sure a python script will be interpreted by python2 and not python3? On my distro, I can use #!/usr/bin/env python2 as the shebang, but it seems not all distros ship "python2". I could explicitly call a specific version (eg. 2.6) of python, but that would rule out people who don't have that version.
It seems to me that this is going to be increasingly a problem when distros will start putting python3 as the default python interpreter.
Assistant: Not quite the same situation, but the company I work for has an app that can run Python scripts (among its many features). After numerous support issues involving Python installations on various platforms, we decided to just install our own Python interpreter with the app. That way we know exactly where it is installed and what version it is. This approach may be too heavyweight for your needs (the Python package is only about 10% of our app's bits) but it definitely works.
