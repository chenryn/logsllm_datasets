Assistant: This log chunk shows two separate attempts to access the system from two different IP addresses. The first attempt was from 103.207.39.16 and the second attempt was from 187.141.143.180. In both attempts, the user attempted to log in with invalid usernames (admin and deploy for the first attempt, and oralce and oracle for the second attempt). In both cases, the attempts were unsuccessful and the user was disconnected.
