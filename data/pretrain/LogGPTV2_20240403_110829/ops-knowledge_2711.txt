User: When I kick off a python script from within another python script using the subprocess module, a zombie process is created when the subprocess "completes". I am unable to kill this subprocess unless I kill my parent python process. 
Is there a way to kill the subprocess without killing the parent? I know I can do this by using wait(), but I need to run my script with no_wait().
Assistant: The python runtime takes responsibility for getting rid of zombie process once their process objects have been garbage collected. If you see the zombie lying around it means you have kept a process object and not called wait, poll or terminate on it.
