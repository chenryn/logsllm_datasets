To improve the API docs and to reduce duplicated documentation work, it seems
to be useful to link to certain parts of the documentation from the API docs
(for example, as stated in #12496, linking to the cookbook that explains how
to use Form events easily adds additional value to the API docs of the
existing events without the need to duplicate information).
