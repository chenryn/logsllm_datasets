I understand that you're trying to install the latest versions of `pip` and `virtualenv` on a server running Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS, but you are limited to using `sudo apt-get install` due to administrative restrictions. Despite updating the package list with `sudo apt-get update`, you are still receiving older versions of these packages (pip 1.0 and virtualenv 1.7.1.2) instead of the more recent ones (pip 1.5.5 and virtualenv 1.11.5).

The issue you're encountering is due to the nature of Long Term Support (LTS) releases in Ubuntu. LTS versions focus on stability and security, which means they typically do not include the most up-to-date versions of software packages. Instead, they provide backported security updates and critical bug fixes to maintain compatibility and system stability.

Given your constraints, here are two potential solutions:

### Option 1: Use a Personal Package Archive (PPA)
You can add a PPA that provides newer versions of `pip` and `virtualenv`. A PPA is a repository maintained by third parties or community members that often includes more recent software versions. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Find a suitable PPA**: You can search for PPAs on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/).
2. **Add the PPA**:
   ```sh
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:<ppa-name>
   ```
3. **Update the package list**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   ```
4. **Install the updated packages**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv
   ```

### Option 2: Manually Download and Install .deb Packages
If adding a PPA is not an option, you can manually download the `.deb` files for the desired versions of `pip` and `virtualenv` and install them.

1. **Download the `.deb` files**:
   - Visit the [Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) website](https://pypi.org/) or other trusted sources to find the `.deb` files for the desired versions.
   - For example, you might download `python-pip_1.5.5-1_all.deb` and `python-virtualenv_1.11.5-1_all.deb`.

2. **Install the `.deb` files**:
   ```sh
   sudo dpkg -i /path/to/python-pip_1.5.5-1_all.deb
   sudo dpkg -i /path/to/python-virtualenv_1.11.5-1_all.deb
   ```

3. **Resolve any dependencies**:
   If there are missing dependencies, use the following command to fix them:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install -f
   ```

By following one of these methods, you should be able to install the more recent versions of `pip` and `virtualenv` on your server. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.

Thank you!
