User: I'm trying to install pip and virtualenv on a server (running Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS) on which I have access, but I can only do it with sudo apt-get install (school politics). The problem is that althought I have run the sudo apt-get update command to update the packages list, I think it keeps installing old ones. After doing sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv, I do pip --version  on which I get the 1.0, and virtualenv --version on which I get 1.7.1.2. These two version are quite old (pip is already in 1.5.5 and virtualenv in 1.11.5). I read that the problem is that the packages list is not up-to-date, but the command sudo apt-get update should solve this, but I guess no. How can I solve this? Thanks a lot!
Assistant: apt-get update updates packages from Ubuntu package catalog, which has nothing to do with mainstream versions.
LTS in Ubuntu stands for Long Term Support. Which means that after a certain period in time they will only release security-related bugfixes to the packages. In general, major version of packages will not change inside of a major Ubuntu release, to make sure backwards-compatibility is kept.
So if then only thing you can do is apt-get update, you have 2 options:

find a PPA that provides fresher versions of packages that you need, add it and repeat the update/install exercise
find those packages elsewhere, download them in .deb format and install.
