Subject: Connection to Broker Lost - Potential Version Issue

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report an issue that I have encountered, which I could not find documented elsewhere. Our current setup is running the following versions:

- amqp: 1.3.3
- billiard: 3.3.0.10
- celery: 3.1.6
- eventlet: 0.14.0
- kombu: 3.0.7

We are experiencing a problem where the connection to the broker is lost, and the system attempts to re-establish it. The error message we receive is as follows:

```

```

Given that we are not running version 3.1.7 of Celery, I plan to upgrade all machines to the latest version to see if this resolves the issue.

Thank you for your assistance.
