Hey, I am not sure if this is a duplicate or not, but I could not find this
exact issue. I realize we are not running 3.1.7 so I will upgrade all machines
to check
Running:  
amqp==1.3.3  
billiard==3.3.0.10  
celery==3.1.6  
eventlet==0.14.0  
kombu==3.0.7
Getting the following issue:
    [2014-01-10 12:13:17,420: WARNING/MainProcess] consumer: Connection to broker lost. Trying to re-establish the connection...
