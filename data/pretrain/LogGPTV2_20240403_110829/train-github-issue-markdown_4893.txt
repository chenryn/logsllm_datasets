This is a bit newbie-unfriendly:
    >>> def f(params, data):
    ...     return (...)
    >>> minimize(f, x0, args=mydata)
    ...
    TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "list") to tuple
This could use similar logic as in `scipy.integrate.quad`, which has
    if not isinstance(args, tuple):
        args = (args,)
