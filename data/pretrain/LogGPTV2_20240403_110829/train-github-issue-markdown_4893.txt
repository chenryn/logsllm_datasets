Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of the text:

The following code snippet may be confusing for new users:

```python
def f(params, data):
    return (...)

minimize(f, x0, args=mydata)
```

This can result in the following `TypeError`:
```
TypeError: can only concatenate tuple (not "list") to tuple
```

To make this more user-friendly, we can adopt a similar approach to that used in `scipy.integrate.quad`, where the `args` parameter is checked and converted to a tuple if it is not already one. The logic would look like this:

```python
if not isinstance(args, tuple):
    args = (args,)
```

By implementing this check, we can ensure that the `args` parameter is always in the correct format, thus avoiding the `TypeError`.
