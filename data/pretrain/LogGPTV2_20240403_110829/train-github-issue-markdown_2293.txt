I have a question, and I can't manage to find the answer in the docs.
I would like to get the HTML the server is going to render on a route so I can
connect it to a service that turns that HTML into a PDF, in order to server
side render pages as PDF.
Can someone shed any light on where I could plug in this? Im playing around in
server.js but I cant manage to get the HTML..
The idea is as follows:
1.- You enter in /document/:id/pdf/ route  
2.- The HTML string is processed by a HTML to PDF script on the server (or
possibly is sent to an external service)  
3.- The server renders the page and serves the PDF document file to the user.
Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
