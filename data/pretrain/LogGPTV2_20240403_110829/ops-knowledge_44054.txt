User: In the operation and maintenance work, what are the common system monitoring indicators? Please list at least five indicators and explain their meaning and role.
Assistant: 1. CPU utilization: Indicates the usage of system CPU resources, usually expressed as a percentage. The CPU utilization rate can reflect the busyness of the system, and timely detection of abnormal CPU utilization rate can help O&M personnel quickly locate and solve problems. 2. Memory usage: reflects the usage of system memory resources. High memory usage means that the memory used by the system has approached or exceeded the total amount of physical memory, which will cause the system to slow down, run slowly, or even the process cannot run. Therefore, timely monitoring of memory usage is very important for the stable operation of the system. 3. Disk space utilization: The disk is the physical medium for storing system data, and the disk space utilization reflects the size of the remaining space for system data storage. When the disk space utilization is close to or reaches 100%, the system cannot continue to store data, and may even cause the system to crash. Therefore, monitoring the disk space utilization in time can prevent such problems from happening. 4. Network traffic: Network traffic refers to the total amount of data passing through the network within a certain period of time in units of data. The network is the channel through which the system interacts with the outside world. Therefore, timely monitoring of network traffic changes can help O&M personnel quickly determine whether the network is working properly and whether network configuration needs to be optimized. 5. Process status: The process status includes various states such as running, sleeping, and zombie, reflecting the real-time status of the system process running status. Knowing the process status in time can help the operation and maintenance personnel to find problems such as abnormal process or zombie process, and solve them in time to ensure the stability of the system.
