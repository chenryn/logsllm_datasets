 **Describe the bug**  
After upgrading three to r123 on a working project, that was before using
r119, three cannot find some Camera's anymore. Strangely enough it can find
some cameras, but not others. It doesn't seem to be related to ortographic vs
perspective. It looks like the problem arrises only with nested camera's, so
cameras within other 3D objects. But I'm not completely sure yet.
I've read all migration guides from r119 -> r120 up to the last one, but
cannot find anything in there that should cause this IMO.
I'm still debuging, but so far this seems to be the issue: `getObjectByName()`
can find some camera's, but others return `undefined` so cannot be found in
the scene loaded by gltf. Before this was working fine, the only thing I
needed to do before was traverse this object, because for some reason camera's
are wrapped inside some object in gltf. But now even the wrapper object cannot
be found. It is still in the gltf or glb though, nothing changed to the data.
    const cameraWrap = scene.getObjectByName(camName);
I keep you informed if I know more when exactly this happens. But for now
please let me know if something has changed that could cause this that I
should be aware of! Thanks
**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Create a scene with objects and camera's in blender (probably the problem occurs when cameras are nested (and nested) within 3D objects, but not sure yet)
  2. Use the blender gltf or glb export to export to gltf or glb
  3. Import the gltf or glb in three to get the scene
  4. Try to get the cameras by using `scene.getObjectByName(camName)`
_**Code**_
    scene.getObjectByName(camName)
**Expected behavior**
Nothing changed in three version according to the migration guide around
cameras or objects AFAIK, so I would expect this to still work in r123.
**Platform:**
  * Device: Desktop/Mobile
  * OS: Windows
  * Browser: Edge Chromium
  * Three.js version: r123
