### Issue with Atom Window After Disconnecting External Monitor

#### Overview
I use an external monitor with my MacBook Pro (OS X 10.9.4 Mavericks) as an extension of my laptop's desktop. During the day, I maximize the Atom editor to fill the entire screen on the external monitor using a window snapping feature enabled via BetterTouchTool. When I disconnect the external monitor and attempt to use Atom on the laptop's built-in display, the window is too large, extending off the screen. To make it visible again, I need to click into Atom, go to the top menu bar, and select `Window -> Zoom`.

#### Detailed Description
Initially, one might assume that the third-party application (BetterTouchTool) is responsible for this issue. However, Atom is the only application that exhibits this behavior. Other applications like Chrome and Outlook, which are also snapped to the external monitor, do not have the same problem. When these apps are moved to the laptop's screen, their width may extend off the screen, but the height is correct, and I can easily resize them by grabbing the title bar.

This leads me to believe that there is an issue with the window settings specific to Atom. I was able to replicate the issue on a co-worker's Mac, but since our environments are similar, I cannot rule out other potential causes.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. **Setup**: Connect an external monitor to your MacBook Pro and extend the desktop.
2. **Maximize Atom**: Use BetterTouchTool to snap the Atom window to fill the entire external monitor.
3. **Disconnect Monitor**: Disconnect the external monitor.
4. **Observe Issue**: The Atom window will be too large and extend off the screen, making the title bar inaccessible.

#### Workaround
To fix the issue:
1. Click into the Atom window.
2. Go to the top menu bar and select `Window -> Zoom`.

#### Expected Behavior
After disconnecting the external monitor, the Atom window should automatically resize to fit the laptop's screen, similar to how Chrome and other applications behave. The title bar should remain accessible, allowing easy resizing.

- **Resizing Chrome: Easy because the title bar is showing - I just snap it to the top and it fills the screen**

By following these steps, you can temporarily resolve the issue, but a more permanent solution would be ideal.
