I use an external monitor with my MacbookPro (OSX 10.9.4 Mavericks). I use
this monitor as an extension of my desktop on the laptop. During the day I
make Atom fill the entire screen (I snap the window, a feature I have enabled
using BetterTouchTool). When I disconnect the external monitor and attempt to
use Atom on the laptop's screen it is too large, as if extending off the
screen. To find it again I have to click into Atom, go to the top bar, Window
-> Zoom. Once I do this it properly fills (again, not fullscreen) the laptop's
screen.
At first you might dismiss this as saying the 3rd party app (BetterTouchTool)
is responsible. However, Atom is the only application that this happens to. I
also keep Chrome and Outlook in the same - window filled via snap mode on the
fullscreen. Both of these apps will extend too far, but the height will be
correct and I can again "grab" the window by the window title bar.
Thus I am led to believe there is something going on with the window settings
for Atom, but I don't know enough about this topic to dig any farther. I was
able to replicate the issue on a co-workers Mac, but we have similar
environments so I can't promise that this isn't being caused by something
else.
The issue: Atom window title bar cannot be found after external disconnect

What should happen: Chrome after external disconnect (all other apps on
external look like this also)

Resizing Chrome: easy because the title bar is showing - I just snap it to the
top and it fills the screen
