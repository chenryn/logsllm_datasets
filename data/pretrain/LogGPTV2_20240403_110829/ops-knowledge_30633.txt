Question: Consider the following scenario: You are tasked with reviewing the security of an authentication system. You encounter a function that compares a user-inputted password to a stored value to verify user identity. Which of the following code modifications would best address the security concern of storing passwords in a recoverable format?
"A": "Replace the use of a compression algorithm with a strong, non-reversible encryption method for password storage.",
"B": "Store the password in plaintext in a separate database with restricted access to limit exposure.",
"C": "Implement a password recovery mechanism that allows users to reset their passwords rather than retrieve them.",
"D": "Apply a reversible encryption algorithm to the password before storage to obfuscate it."
Answer: A
