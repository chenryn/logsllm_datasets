User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Hack: anymonous URL on my Joomla Website[Resolve] My website has been hacked again. There are many foreign URLs such as here.

I've checked the database and there is nothing strange in my database. Does anyone know what kind of hack attack is like this?

Then I have to execute all files with exit (); and I quit "on /libraries/import.legacy.php".

If I give exit () under

JLoader :: register ('JRoute', JPATH_PLATFORM. '/joomla/application/route.php');


the result is that my website is still able to walk, but with the strange link.

But if I give exit() in the above

JLoader :: register ('JRoute', JPATH_PLATFORM. '/joomla/application/route.php')


The result is that the website stops.

this my error log

eval/**test*/(/**test*/$wp1/**test*/(/**test*/$word('Code)));


Thank you all

Assistant: JRoute is the module tasked with dealing with internal urls. The evil code is hooking there to make such urls show their spam page.

You could see what they changed by comparing the files with the official ones from Joomla. In the end, you should replace the compromised Joomla php files with the original ones.
