User: The docs for the subprocess module state that 'If shell is True, the specified command will be executed through the shell'. What does this mean in practice, on a Windows OS?
Assistant: When you execute an external process, the command you want may look something like "foo arg1 arg2 arg3". If "foo" is an executable, that is what gets executed and given the arguments. 
However, often it is the case that "foo" is actually a script of some sort, or maybe a command that is built-in to the shell and not an actual executable file on disk. In this case the system can't execute "foo" directly because, strictly speaking, these sorts of things aren't executable. They need some sort of "shell" to execute them. On *nix systems this shell is typically (but not necessarily) /bin/sh. On windows it will typically be cmd.exe (or whatever is stored in the COMSPEC environment variable).
This parameter lets you define what shell you wish to use to execute your command, for the relatively rare case when you don't want the default.
