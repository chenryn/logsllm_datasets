User: How to ensure the security of cloud servers, and how to deal with DDoS attacks?
Assistant: There are several ways to ensure the security of the cloud server: 1. Strong password: set the length to be more than 8 characters, including a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. 2. Regularly update operating systems, applications, server components, security patches, etc.: update all software in a timely manner, and deal with technical vulnerabilities in a timely manner. 3. Encrypted data: Sensitive information that needs to be stored on the website, such as passwords, credit card information, etc., should be stored in an encrypted manner. 4. Set access control: Cooperate with network security policies to limit the method and purpose of remote access to the server. 5. Install a firewall: A firewall can block access to malicious internal and external websites and IP addresses. In the fight against DDoS attacks, the following are common methods: 1. Cloud protection: Using the network protection provided by cloud service providers, these tools can automatically identify and exclude unnecessary traffic. 2. Install a firewall: Make sure that an effective firewall is installed on the server terminal, which can detect and block a large amount of traffic. 3. Use CDN distribution filtering: Redirect the request to the operator's CDN (Content Distribution Network) node, reducing the chance that the attacking host can access the original server. 4. Intercept traffic: Determine the source of attack traffic and block malicious traffic on the server side. 5. Business traffic cleaning: In the entire network, invalid and malicious traffic is cleaned, and only normal traffic is allowed to reach the target server. 6. Limit resource usage: Daily monitoring and management of resources assigned to users, and set quotas to prevent user abuse.
