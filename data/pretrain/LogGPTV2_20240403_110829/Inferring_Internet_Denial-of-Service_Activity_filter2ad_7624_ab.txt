source addresses within our monitored range passes
the Anderson-Darling (A2) test for uniformity to the
0.05 signiﬁcance level.
 Port settings: for source and destination ports (for
both UDP and TCP) we record whether the port
range is ﬁxed, is uniform under the A2 test, or is
non-ﬁxed and non-uniform.

We generate a database in which each record charac-
terizes the properties of a single attack.
4.2 Event-based classiﬁcation
Because the choice of ﬂow parameters can impact the
estimated duration of an attack, the ﬂow-based method
may obscure interesting time-domain characteristics. In
particular, attacks can be highly variable – with periodic
bursts of activity – causing the ﬂow-based method to
vastly underestimate the short-term impact of an attack
and overestimate the long-term impact.
We use an event-based classiﬁcation method keyed en-
tirely on the victim’s IP address over ﬁxed time-windows
for examining time-domain qualities, such as the number
of simultaneous attacks or the distribution of attack rates,
For these analyses we divide our trace into one minute
periods and record each attack event during this period.
An attack event is deﬁned by a victim emitting at least
ten backscatter packets during a one minute period. We
do not further classify attacks according to protocol type,
port, etc, as the goal is to estimate the instantaneous im-
pact on a particular victim. The result of this classiﬁca-
tion is a database in which each record characterizes the
number of victims and the intensity of the attacks in each
one minute period.

We monitor all trafﬁc to our /8 network by passively monitoring
data as it is forwarded through a shared hub. This monitoring
point represents the only ingress into the network.
5 Experimental platform
For our experiments monitored the sole ingress link into
 distinct IP
a lightly utilized /8 network (comprising 
addresses, or 1/256 of the total Internet address space).
Our monitoring infrastructure, shown in Figure 2, con-
sisted of a PC conﬁgured to capture all Ethernet trafﬁc,
attached to a shared hub at the router terminating this
network. During this time, the upstream router did ﬁl-
ter some trafﬁc destined to the network (notably external
SNMP queries) but we do not believe that this signiﬁ-
cantly impacted our results. We also have some evidence
that small portions of our address preﬁx are occasion-
ally “hijacked” by inadvertent route advertisements else-
where in the Internet, but at worst this should cause us
to slightly underestimate attack intensities. We collected
three traces, each roughly spanning one week, starting
on February 1st and extending to February 25th, and iso-
lated the inbound portion of the network.
6 Results
Using the previously described ﬂows-based approach
(Section 4.1), we observed 12,805 attacks over the course
of a week. Table 2 summarizes this data, showing more
than 5,000 distinct victim IP addresses in more than
2,000 distinct DNS domains. Across the entire period we
observed almost 200 million backscatter packets (again,
representing less than
ing this period).

attacks seen in our trace, and then characterize the at-

Table 3: Breakdown of response protocols.
6.1 Time series
Figure 3 shows a time series graph of the estimated
number of actively attacked victims throughout the three
traces, as sampled in one hour periods. There are two
gaps in this graph corresponding to the gaps between
traces.
In contrast to other workloads, such as HTTP,
the number of active attacks does not appear to follow
any diurnal pattern (at least as observed from a single lo-
cation). The outliers on the week of February 20th, with
more than 150 victim IP addresses per hour, represent
broad attacks against many machines in a common net-
work. While most of the backscatter data averages one
victim IP address per network preﬁx per hour, the ratio
climbs to above ﬁve for many outliers.
6.2 Attack classiﬁcation
In this section we characterize attacks according to the
protocols used in response packets sent by victims, the
protocols used in the original attack packets, and the rate
and durations of attacks.
6.2.1 Response protocols
In Table 3 we decompose our backscatter data according
to the protocols of responses returned by the victim or an
intermediate host. For each trace we list both the num-
ber of attacks and the number backscatter packets for the
given protocol. The numbers in parentheses show the
relative percentage represented by each count. For ex-
ample, 1,837 attacks in Trace 2 (47% of the total), were
derived from TCP backscatter with the RST and ACK
ﬂags set.
We observe that over 50% of the attacks and 20% of
the backscatter packets are TCP packets with the RST
ﬂag set. Referring back to Table 1 we see that RST is
sent in response to either a SYN ﬂood directed against a
closed port or some other unexpected TCP packet. The
next largest protocol category is ICMP host unreachable,
comprising roughly 15% of the attacks. Almost all of
these ICMP messages contain the TCP header from a
packet directed at the victim, suggesting a TCP ﬂood of
some sort. Unfortunately, the TCP ﬂags ﬁeld cannot be
recovered, because the ICMP response only includes the
ﬁrst 28 bytes of the original IP packet. ICMP host un-
reachable is generally returned by a router when a packet
cannot be forwarded to its destination. Probing some of
these victims we conﬁrmed that a number of them could
not be reached, but most were accessible, suggesting in-
termittent connectivity. This discontinuous reachability
is probably caused by explicit “black holing’ on the part
of an ISP.
We also see a number of SYN/ACK backscatter pack-
ets (likely sent directly in response to a SYN ﬂood on an
open port) and an equivalent number of assorted ICMP
messages, including ICMP echo reply (resulting from
ICMP echo request ﬂoods), ICMP protocol unreachable
(sent in response to attacks using illegal combinations of
TCP ﬂags), ICMP fragmentation needed (caused by at-
tacks with the “Dont Fragment” bit set) and ICMP ad-
ministratively ﬁltered (likely the result of some attack
countermeasure). However, a more surprising ﬁnding
is the large number of ICMP TTL exceeded messages
– comprising between 36% and 62% of all backscatter
packets observed, yet less than 15% of the total attacks.
In fact, the vast majority of these packets occur in just
a few attacks, including three attacks on @Home cus-
tomers, two on China Telecom (one with almost 9 mil-
lion backscatter packets), and others directed at Roma-
nia, Belgium, Switzerland and New Zealand. The at-
tack on the latter was at an extremely high rate, suggest-
ing an attack of more than 150,000 packets per second.
We are unable to completely explain the mechanism for
the generation of these time-exceeded messages. Upon
examination of the encapsulated header that is returned,
we note that several of them share identical “signatures”
(ICMP Echo with identical sequence number, identiﬁca-
tion ﬁelds, and checksum) suggesting that a single attack
tool was in use.

of attack protocols. That is, the protocol which must
