### Address Uniformity
We assess the uniformity of source addresses within our monitored range using the Anderson-Darling (A2) test, with a significance level of 0.05.

### Port Settings
For both UDP and TCP, we record whether the source and destination ports are fixed, uniform (as determined by the A2 test), or non-fixed and non-uniform.

### DNS Information
- **Source Address:** The victim's IP address.
- **Full DNS Address:** The complete DNS name of the victim.
- **Prefix, Mask, and Origin:** Details of the network prefix, subnet mask, and origin.

### Routing Information
- **Autonomous System (AS):** The AS as registered in our local BGP table on the morning of February 7th.

We generate a database where each record characterizes the properties of a single attack.

## 4.2 Event-Based Classification
The choice of flow parameters can impact the estimated duration of an attack, potentially obscuring interesting time-domain characteristics. Specifically, attacks can be highly variable, with periodic bursts of activity, leading to underestimation of short-term impact and overestimation of long-term impact when using flow-based methods.

To address this, we use an event-based classification method that focuses on the victimâ€™s IP address over fixed time windows. This approach allows us to examine time-domain qualities such as the number of simultaneous attacks and the distribution of attack rates. We divide our trace into one-minute periods and record each attack event during this period. An attack event is defined as a victim emitting at least ten backscatter packets within a one-minute period. We do not further classify attacks based on protocol type or port, as our goal is to estimate the instantaneous impact on a particular victim. The result is a database where each record characterizes the number of victims and the intensity of attacks in each one-minute period.

## 5. Experimental Platform
For our experiments, we monitored the sole ingress link into a lightly utilized /8 network (comprising approximately 1/256 of the total Internet address space). Our monitoring infrastructure, shown in Figure 2, consisted of a PC configured to capture all Ethernet traffic, attached to a shared hub at the router terminating this network. During the monitoring period, the upstream router filtered some traffic destined for the network (notably external SNMP queries), but we do not believe this significantly impacted our results. We also have evidence that small portions of our address prefix were occasionally "hijacked" by inadvertent route advertisements elsewhere in the Internet, which, at worst, would cause us to slightly underestimate attack intensities. We collected three traces, each spanning roughly one week, starting on February 1st and extending to February 25th, and isolated the inbound portion of the network.

## 6. Results
Using the previously described flow-based approach (Section 4.1), we observed 12,805 attacks over the course of a week. Table 2 summarizes this data, showing more than 5,000 distinct victim IP addresses in more than 2,000 distinct DNS domains. Across the entire period, we observed almost 200 million backscatter packets, representing less than 1% of the actual attack traffic during this period.

In this section, we first show the overall frequency of attacks seen in our trace and then characterize the attacks according to both the type of attack and the type of victim.

### Table 2: Summary of Backscatter Database

| Trace | Duration (Days) | Unique Victim IPs | Unique Victim DNS Domains | Unique Victim DNS TLDs | Unique Victim Network Prefixes | Unique Victim Autonomous Systems | Attacks | Total Attack Packets |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|----------------------|
| Trace-1 | 7.5 | 750 | 60 | 1,132 | 585 | 4,173 | 1,942 | 50,827,217 |
| Trace-2 | 6.2 | 693 | 62 | 1,085 | 575 | 3,878 | 1,821 | 78,234,768 |
| Trace-3 | 7.1 | 876 | 71 | 1,281 | 677 | 4,754 | 2,385 | 62,233,762 |

[Insert Figure 3]

### 6.1 Time Series
Figure 3 shows a time series graph of the estimated number of actively attacked victims throughout the three traces, sampled in one-hour periods. There are two gaps in this graph corresponding to the gaps between traces. In contrast to other workloads, such as HTTP, the number of active attacks does not appear to follow any diurnal pattern (at least as observed from a single location). The outliers on the week of February 20th, with more than 150 victim IP addresses per hour, represent broad attacks against many machines in a common network. While most of the backscatter data averages one victim IP address per network prefix per hour, the ratio climbs to above five for many outliers.

### 6.2 Attack Classification
In this section, we characterize attacks according to the protocols used in response packets sent by victims, the protocols used in the original attack packets, and the rate and durations of attacks.

#### 6.2.1 Response Protocols
Table 3 decomposes our backscatter data according to the protocols of responses returned by the victim or an intermediate host. For each trace, we list both the number of attacks and the number of backscatter packets for the given protocol. The numbers in parentheses show the relative percentage represented by each count.

### Table 3: Breakdown of Response Protocols

| Protocol | Trace-1 | Trace-2 | Trace-3 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| TCP (RST ACK) | 2,027 (49%) | 1,837 (47%) | 2,118 (45%) |
| ICMP (Host Unreachable) | 699 (17%) | 560 (14%) | 776 (16%) |
| ICMP (TTL Exceeded) | 453 (11%) | 495 (13%) | 626 (13%) |
| ICMP (Other) | 486 (12%) | 441 (11%) | 520 (11%) |
| TCP (SYN ACK) | 378 (9.1%) | 276 (7.1%) | 346 (7.3%) |
| TCP (RST) | 128 (3.1%) | 269 (6.9%) | 367 (7.7%) |
| TCP (Other) | 2 (0.05%) | 0 (0.00%) | 1 (0.02%) |

We observe that over 50% of the attacks and 20% of the backscatter packets are TCP packets with the RST flag set. Referring back to Table 1, we see that RST is sent in response to either a SYN flood directed against a closed port or some other unexpected TCP packet. The next largest protocol category is ICMP host unreachable, comprising roughly 15% of the attacks. Almost all of these ICMP messages contain the TCP header from a packet directed at the victim, suggesting a TCP flood of some sort. Unfortunately, the TCP flags field cannot be recovered because the ICMP response only includes the first 28 bytes of the original IP packet. ICMP host unreachable is generally returned by a router when a packet cannot be forwarded to its destination. Probing some of these victims, we confirmed that a number of them could not be reached, but most were accessible, suggesting intermittent connectivity. This discontinuous reachability is probably caused by explicit "black holing" on the part of an ISP.

We also see a number of SYN/ACK backscatter packets (likely sent directly in response to a SYN flood on an open port) and an equivalent number of assorted ICMP messages, including ICMP echo reply (resulting from ICMP echo request floods), ICMP protocol unreachable (sent in response to attacks using illegal combinations of TCP flags), ICMP fragmentation needed (caused by attacks with the "Don't Fragment" bit set), and ICMP administratively filtered (likely the result of some attack countermeasure). However, a more surprising finding is the large number of ICMP TTL exceeded messages, comprising between 36% and 62% of all backscatter packets observed, yet less than 15% of the total attacks. In fact, the vast majority of these packets occur in just a few attacks, including three attacks on @Home customers, two on China Telecom (one with almost 9 million backscatter packets), and others directed at Romania, Belgium, Switzerland, and New Zealand. The attack on the latter was at an extremely high rate, suggesting an attack of more than 150,000 packets per second. We are unable to completely explain the mechanism for the generation of these time-exceeded messages. Upon examination of the encapsulated header that is returned, we note that several of them share identical "signatures" (ICMP Echo with identical sequence number, identification fields, and checksum), suggesting that a single attack tool was in use.

#### 6.2.2 Attack Protocols
Table 4 refines this data to show the distribution of attack protocols, i.e., the protocol which must have been used by the attacker to produce the backscatter.

### Table 4: Breakdown of Protocols Used in Attacks

| Protocol | Trace-1 | Trace-2 | Trace-3 |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| TCP | 3,902 (94%) | 3,472 (90%) | 4,378 (92%) |
| UDP | 99 (2.4%) | 194 (5.0%) | 131 (2.8%) |
| ICMP | 88 (2.1%) | 102 (2.6%) | 107 (2.3%) |
| Proto 0 | 65 (1.6%) | 108 (2.8%) | 104 (2.2%) |
| Other | 19 (0.46%) | 2 (0.05%) | 34 (0.72%) |
