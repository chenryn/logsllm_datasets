the adversary to specify or know the messages for which the
signature veriﬁes.
The ﬁrst game-based formalization of this notion was
provided by Brendel et al. [4], who introduced the term
message-bound signatures. We provide the formal details on
the right-hand side in Figure 2. In the security experiment, we
require the adversary to output two messages, a signature and a
public key. It wins the game if both messages are not identical
and if the signature veriﬁes correctly for each message under
the public key.
Definition III.2. Let Π be a digital signature scheme. We say
that Π provides message-bound signatures (MBS) if, for every
PPT algorithm A, there exists a negligible function µ : N → R
such that, for every λ ∈ N, it holds that Pr[ExpMBS
Π,A (λ)] ≤
µ(λ), where ExpMBS
Π,A (λ) is deﬁned on the right-hand side in
Figure 2.
Chalkias et al. [21] call MBS signatures binding signatures
and deﬁne strongly binding signatures as the conjunction of
the MBS and M-S-UEO notions from [4].
IV. NEW THEORETICAL RESULTS
In this section, we present our main new theoretical results,
which apply to the classical as well as the post-quantum
setting. In Section IV-A we introduce two analogous notions of
exclusive ownership. In Section IV-B we provide the ﬁrst formal
security deﬁnition for non re-signability. We establish relations
among the security properties in Section IV-C, before giving a
generic transformation that efﬁciently and provably achieves
our security properties beyond unforgeability in Section IV-D.
A. New Notions of Exclusive Ownership
Brendel et al. [4] introduced a strong variant of universal
exclusive ownership, for which the attacker is not required
to output the corresponding secret key of the new key pair.
Analogously, we introduce two notions called strong conser-
vative exclusive ownership and strong destructive exclusive
ownership, where the attacker is only required to output a new
public key and is additionally equipped with a signing oracle
that it can query adaptively.
1) Strong Conservative Exclusive Ownership (S-CEO): In
the security experiment, the adversary is only given a legitimate
public key pk and additionally access to a signature oracle such
that it can adaptively obtain arbitrary signatures for messages
of its choice. The adversary is now asked to output a triple
containing a message m(cid:48), a signature σ(cid:48), and a new public key
(cid:48). It wins the game if the signature correctly veriﬁes under
pk

Throughout the rest of the paper we will analyze schemes
with respect to these strong notions.
B. Non Re-signability
Jackson et al. [3] observed that for some signature schemes,
an adversary that obtains the signature of a message m can
produce another signature that veriﬁes m under its own key
without knowing m. For example, this can happen when the
scheme reveals the hash of the message, which then enables
re-signing this message with a different key. This runs contrary
to the intuition that to produce a signature on a message,
one should know the message. Jackson et al. coined this
notion non re-signability (NR) and gave a symbolic model
for the Tamarin prover. However, they did not provide a formal
cryptographic deﬁnition, which is required to prove that a given

signature scheme satisiﬁes NR. We close this gap by providing
the ﬁrst security experiment for non re-signability.
Intuitively, the property non re-signability states that the
adversary cannot produce a legitimate signature verifying under
its public key for a message it does not know. The game in
Figure 4 formalizes this notion. In more detail, after generating
a key pair, the game runs a PPT distribution D that outputs a
message m along with some auxiliary information aux about
the message. One can think of the auxiliary information as
being some structural information about the message. The
game continues with generating the signature σ on m, and
the adversary is then given the legitimate public key pk, the
signature σ, as well as the auxiliary information. The adversary
is now tasked to output a pair containing a signature σ(cid:48) and a
(cid:48). It wins the game if both public keys do

not coincide and the signature σ(cid:48) veriﬁes m under pk
the message output by the
distribution D is unpredictable by requiring the conditional
(HILL) min-entropy to be strictly greater than logarithmic in the
security parameter. Without this, the adversary could predict
the underlying message m from the signature and trivially
re-sign the message under the new key.
Definition IV.3. Let Π be a digital signature scheme. We say
that Π is non-resignable (NR) if, for every PPT algorithms A
and D, there exists a negligible function µ : N → R such

C. Relationship
Note that we assume that
Being equipped with these security properties beyond un-
forgeability, we are now in the position to establish that all prop-
erties are independent in the sense that there are schemes which
may have all properties except for a particular one. This holds
for each property from M-S-UEO, S-CEO, S-DEO, MBS, NR
and EUF-CMA. In the following we exemplify the separations
only for the S-CEO property. The remaining relationships and
respective proofs can be found in the full version.
Proposition IV.4. If there is a digital signature scheme which
has properties P ⊆ {EUF-CMA, S-DEO, NR, MBS}, then

there is also one which has the same properties P but not
S-CEO.
Note that since M-S-UEO implies S-CEO it follows that
the derived scheme cannot have M-S-UEO, and we thus also
exclude this property from P.
Proof. Modify the scheme Π = (KGen, Sig, Vf) with prop-
erties P to scheme Π¬S-CEO by introducing an exceptional
signing and veriﬁcation step for message m = 0 and public
keys of the form pk(cid:107)0 (which the genuine key generation
algorithm never outputs):
Π¬S-CEO.KGen(1λ):
11 :
12 :
Π¬S-CEO.Sig(sk, m):
21 : σ ←$ Π.Sig(sk, m)
22 :
23 :
24 : else
25 :
Π¬S-CEO.Vf(pk(cid:107)b, m, σ(cid:107)c):

32 :
33 : else
34 :
35 :

return (sk, pk(cid:107)1)
d ← Π.Vf(m, σ, pk)
return d
return [c = 0 ∧ m = 0]
if m = 0 then
return σ(cid:107)0
return σ(cid:107)1
if b = 0 then
The scheme inherits correctness of the original scheme.
To break property S-CEO it sufﬁces to request a signature
σ(cid:107)0 for message m = 0 under given key pk(cid:107)1, and to output
this message-signature pair with key pk(cid:107)0. This constitutes a
valid forgery against S-CEO since the pair has been signed but
is also accepted under the new key pk(cid:107)0 ending with 0.
We need to argue that the scheme Π¬S-CEO preserves the
property S-DEO. Assume that the adversary against DEO of
(cid:48)(cid:107)0 in the ﬁnal output. Then
the modiﬁed scheme attempts pk
the only message that is accepted under this key is m(cid:48) = 0,
but then any distinct query m (cid:54)= 0 to the signing oracle causes
the signature σ(cid:107)1 to end in 1, such that these signatures cannot
be valid for m(cid:48) = 0. If, on the other hand, the adversary uses
(cid:48) (cid:54)= pk and there
pk
was a query m to the signer which created the signature. In
particular, the actual signature part (without the trailing bit)
must match for this query and still m (cid:54)= m(cid:48). We then construct
a black-box reduction to the S-DEO property of the underlying
scheme, by letting the reduction append (for signature queries)
and chop off (for the forgery) the additional bits.
(cid:48)(cid:107)1 in its attempt then we must have pk
Next, it is easy to show that the scheme preserves the
property EUF-CMA because any forgery would have to be
against honestly generated public keys ending with 1, such
that the exceptional step in veriﬁcation cannot be triggered.
Adding and removing the extra bits of the public key and the
signature gives the desired security reduction to the property
of the original scheme.
As for MBS note that, if the adversary chooses pk(cid:107)0 then
only one message, namely m = 0, is accepted at all. Hence to
ﬁnd distinct m1 (cid:54)= m2 with valid signature σ(cid:107)c under some
public key, the key must be of the form pk(cid:107)1. But then m1, m2
together with σ and pk constitute a valid MBS-attack against
the original scheme.
It remains to argue that the modiﬁed scheme preserves
property NR. To see this note that D must have super-
logarithmic min-entropy such that the probability that m = 0
is negligible. This means that with overwhelming probability
the adversary cannot use a key of the form pk(cid:107)0 to win. In any
other case it is again immediate to reduce an attack against the
modiﬁed scheme to an attack against the starting scheme.
D. BUFF transformation: A generic transformation for prov-
ably achieving M-S-UEO, MBS, and NR
We construct a generic transformation that ensures that the
resulting signature scheme achieves Beyond UnForgeability
Features (i.e., M-S-UEO, MBS, and NR): The BUFF transfor-
mation. This transformation works for both the classical and
the post-quantum setting. Before we present the details, we ﬁrst
revisit known transformations for some individual properties.
Pornin and Stern [2] provided three transformations to add the
notions of exclusive ownership to a signature scheme. Two
of their transformations make use of a collision resistant hash
function and also increase the signature size, while the third
one does not increase the signature size but requires a random
oracle; none of them achieves NR. While Pornin and Stern
prove that their transformations achieve their “weak” variants
of exclusive ownership (CEO and DEO), we argue their proofs
translate to the strong notions (as formalized in Section IV-A)
in a straightforward manner. We brieﬂy summarize those
transformations and their guarantees.
