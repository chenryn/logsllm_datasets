Abstract—Recent years have seen extensive growth of services
enabling free broadcasts of live streams on the Web. Free live
streaming (FLIS) services attract millions of viewers and make
heavy use of deceptive advertisements. Despite the immense
popularity of these services, little is known about the parties
that facilitate it and maintain webpages to index links for free
viewership.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the FLIS
ecosystem by mapping all parties involved in the anonymous
broadcast of live streams, discovering their modus operandi,
and quantifying the consequences for common Internet users
who utilize these services. We develop an infrastructure that
enables us to perform more than 850,000 visits by identifying
5,685 free live streaming domains, and analyze more than 1
Terabyte of trafﬁc to map the parties that constitute the FLIS
ecosystem. On the one hand, our analysis reveals that users of
FLIS websites are generally exposed to deceptive advertisements,
malware, malicious browser extensions, and fraudulent scams.
On the other hand, we ﬁnd that FLIS parties are often reported
for copyright violations and host their infrastructure predomi-
nantly in Europe and Belize. At the same time, we encounter
substandard advertisement set-ups by the FLIS parties, along
with potential trademark infringements through the abuse of
domain names and logos of popular TV channels.
Given the magnitude of the discovered abuse, we engineer
features that characterize FLIS pages and build a classiﬁer to
identify FLIS pages with high accuracy and low false positives,
in an effort to help human analysts identify malicious services
and, whenever appropriate, initiate content-takedown requests.
I.
INTRODUCTION
Despite the growth and popularity of the Internet in the
early 90’s, transmission of sound and video over the Internet
remained a huge challenge. It was not until 1995, when
technology was able to cope with the requirements of online
streaming, that the world’s ﬁrst live streaming event, a base-
ball match between the New York Yankees and the Seattle
Mariners, was broadcasted by Progressive Networks [7]. Ever
since, the online video utilization has risen massively, now
with a million minutes of video traversing the Internet every
second [38].

This massive consumption and endorsement of online video
brought with it the rise of extremely popular services for free
live streaming (FLIS). FLIS services enable free viewership of
video content, albeit typically without the consent of a content
owner, of TV channels and live events for Internet users. These
services manage infrastructure to facilitate costless anonymous
broadcasting of live streams, and maintain websites to index
links for free live streams.
Like any other widely embraced online video service,
the emergence of FLIS has given lift
to digital copyright
infringements. In fact, multibillion-dollar industries have been
directly affected by these services. As a case in point, an
estimated cost of FLIS to a particular soccer league was
more than 15 million dollars per year, and that was only
because of a single free live streaming website [31], [45]. It
is also worth to note that TV broadcasters had invested more
than 3 billion dollars for the exclusive rights of this league’s
event. Same is the case with other events where billions of
dollars were invested to acquire the broadcasting rights that are
illicitly being monetized by the FLIS services [16], [24]. These
incidents highlight the extent of the damages FLIS services are
causing to TV broadcast and related industries.
threat
Apart from the copyright infringements, there is another
serious, and practically unexplored,
imposed by the
FLIS services to their users i.e., deceptive exploitation for
monetary gains. To date, FLIS services have been analyzed
mostly from a legal perspective [28], [50]. However, to the best
of our knowledge, there has been no study that systematically
analyzes the workings of different FLIS parties and empirically
assesses the threats for everyday users of FLIS services.
To this end, we argue that a careful analysis and thorough
understanding of FLIS services is necessary for effectively
combating them. It can enable the take-downs that will disrupt
the free illegal live streaming operations [8], [9], [43], the
identiﬁcation of parties facilitating anonymous free broadcasts
of live streams, and it is critical for shedding light on the
malicious practices used to monetize the FLIS business.
In this paper, we highlight the negative effect of FLIS on
users and expose the infrastructure of the FLIS ecosystem.
Particularly, we target web based sports-speciﬁc FLIS services.
The reason to target these services is that they are immensely
popular1, constantly emerging [16], [24], and often reported
for copyright law violations [31], [45]. To uncover the FLIS
ecosystem and quantify the threats to FLIS users, we conduct
the following three-pronged analysis:
1The most popular FLIS domain, rojadirecta.me, we analyze have a global
Alexa rank of 1,553 with an estimated 8 million visits on this site monthly.
First, we develop an infrastructure that enables us to (1)
gather unknown FLIS webpages by leveraging the infrastruc-
ture of search engines and, (2) inspect network trafﬁc to iden-
tify the parties providing media servers for free anonymous
broadcasting of live streams. Using our infrastructure, we
identify more than 23,000 FLIS webpages corresponding to
5,685 domains. Next, we perform more than 850,000 visits to
the identiﬁed FLIS domains and analyze more than 1 Terabyte
of trafﬁc to identify the parties providing media servers. Of
these identiﬁed parties, we notice that 64% have been reported
at least once for violating the copyrights of respective owners.
Additionally, our investigations reveal that the FLIS services
host their infrastructure predominantly in Europe and Belize.
For instance, we discover that nearly 25% of the inspected
free live sport streams were broadcasted from media servers
hosted in Belize, and more than 60% of identiﬁed streams
were broadcasted from media servers located in Switzerland,
Belize, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada.
Second, through a series of automated and manual experi-
ments, we ﬁnd that FLIS services are involved in substandard
advertisement practices, possible trademark infringements, and
deceptive exploitations, targeting their users as well as TV
broadcasters and sports organizations. Among others, by ana-
lyzing video overlay ads and 30,354 advertisement websites,
we show that the users of FLIS services are often exposed to
deceptive, unavoidable, and malicious ads. Our analysis reveal
that one out of two ad websites, presented to the FLIS service
users, is malicious in nature, offering malware (zero-day in
one case), showing fake law enforcement messages to collect
purported ﬁnes, and luring users to install malicious browser
extensions. Additionally, we unintentionally ﬁnd seven FLIS
domains distributing malware disguised as as an application to
watch free live streams on mobile devices.
Last, given the intensity of possible copyright violations
and discovered threats, we present a FLIS classiﬁer that aims
to classify the FLIS webpages both effectively and efﬁciently.
Instead of relying on signature-based techniques, the FLIS
classiﬁer models representative attributes of FLIS pages which
achieve a high detection accuracy with a negligible false
positive rate. Our data gathering infrastructure demonstrates
a real-world utilization of our classiﬁer where it was deployed
in an online process to identify unknown FLIS pages. As
an application, our classiﬁer can be readily used by law
enforcement to ﬁnd previously unknown FLIS websites that
can then be analyzed for potential abuses.
II. AN OVERVIEW OF FREE LIVE STREAMING SERVICES
In this section, we map the ecosystem of free live streaming
services. The FLIS ecosystem, as shown in Figure 1, consists
of three main parties: channel providers, aggregators, and
advertisers. We arrived at this model through the analysis of
investigated FLIS services, and through the recording of com-
mon attributes. We now provide an overview of the identiﬁed
FLIS parties, followed by a discussion of their business model
(Section II-A), and their tactics for monetizing user views
(Section II-B).
Channel Providers are the entities that provide the infras-
tructure to facilitate live streaming on the Web. Speciﬁcally, the
channel provider maintains a media server that can be used by
anyone for free. The purpose of the media server is to receive
a live video stream from a remote machine (origin machine)
and broadcast it to a wide range of viewers on the Internet.
Figure 1: Overview of the operational model of FLIS.  The
channel provider maintains a media server to freely broadcast
live streams received from the origin machines and provides
embedding-code with a Flash player.  The aggregator cata-
logs embedding-codes and index links of live streams on its
webpage.  A visitor lands on the aggregator’s page and clicks
on the indexed links, redirected to the FLIS video page on the
aggregator’s domain, and ﬁnds the ads displayed on the video
player by the ad networks.  Money ﬂows from the advertiser
to the ad network, the aggregator, and the channel provider.
The origin machine can be operated by the channel provider
itself or it may belong to a different third-party. For instance,
a miscreant can digitally capture a live TV broadcast of any
sport event and stream it online anonymously for free, thanks
to the media server maintained by the channel provider.
To facilitate a free-of-cost live streaming service, chan-
nel providers usually maintain a simple web interface (e.g.,
jjcast.com, biggestplayer.me). When a user wishes to broadcast
her stream for free, she creates a channel (on air broadcast)
on the channel provider’s web interface. After creating the
channel, she gets a media-server URL to use with her origin
machine for transmitting the media trafﬁc through the channel
provider’s media server. Along with the media-server URL,
she also receives stream-embedding code to place on her
page, at
the position where she wants the live stream to
appear. The stream-embedding code is an HTML snippet or
JavaScript code that creates the HTML snippet, in the form of
an  element. It usually contains a customized Flash
player from the channel provider along with the necessary
conﬁgurations to broadcast the live stream. The general format
of the stream-embedding code given by channel providers is
as follows:

LinkAdAdAdvertisersStreaming LinkStreaming LinkStreaming LinkLinkLinkFLIS Channel Providermedia-server     Media StreamFLISVideo Page1234FLISAggregatorOrigin Machines Ad NetworksEmbed-Code/Flash Player Revenue Aggregators catalog the stream-embedding codes, usually
from different channel providers, and index links of various
free live streams in their webpage. In other words, they provide
a single site to watch numerous live events and TV channels
for free. When a user lands on one of these websites, she is
typically offered 2-3 links per live event. Once a user clicks
the link, she is redirected to the FLIS video page, hosted on
the same domain, where the stream-embedding code executes.
This execution renders the Flash player on the page and
automatically starts a live stream broadcast from the channel
provider’s media server.
In general, channel provider services and aggregator web-
pages can be maintained for both legitimate and illicit pur-
poses. In this paper we focus on the entities that enable live
streaming of the sports events and sports TV channels for free.
Hereafter we use the term channel providers and aggregators
to refer exclusively to those parties that manage infrastructure
to broadcast free live sports events and index links of free live
sports streams on their webpages.
A. The FLIS Ecosystem
We illustrate the FLIS ecosystem in terms of the business
model of different parties involved.
Channel Providers. As mentioned earlier,
the channel
provider supplies the stream-embedding code for free live
streaming. This code, along with the Flash player, carries
additional JavaScript code from an ad network. This script
displays ads on the top of the Flash player as overlay ads
using  elements. The overlay ads are images or
Flash content
that “overlays” the video content and runs
concurrently with the live stream [13]. Usually, the channel
providers generate revenue from the overlay ads through
cost-per-thousand (CPT) or click-through-rate (CTR) reporting
metrics. While CPT is calculated by dividing the cost of an
overlay ad placement by the number of impressions (expressed
in thousands) that it generates, CTR is measured as the ratio of
the number of times an overlay ad was displayed to the number
of times it was clicked. We observe that, to maximize their
proﬁt, channel providers often include Javascript code from
different ad networks. As an outcome, FLIS viewers have to
interact with various overlay ads superimposed on top of each
other, usually displayed in the middle of the player.
Aggregators. Like channel providers,
the main source of
revenue for aggregators is through advertisements. Aggregators
use a variety of ad techniques that include pop-unders, pop-
ups, and even overlay ads on the Flash player2. The aggregators
include remote JavaScript code from ad networks that exam-
ine the composition of the aggregator page and present ads
from other third-party sources. In addition to CPT and CTR,
aggregator webpages also earn revenue through cost-per-click
(CPC), i.e., the aggregator domain receives a commission from
the ad network each time a user clicks on the delivered ad.
Advertisers. Advertisers and ad networks are the lifeblood
of the FLIS ecosystem. As mentioned before, both channel
providers and aggregators include JavaScript code from ad
networks to monetize their operations. The ad network’s code
2Since the Flash video player is rendered on the aggregator page, the
aggregator can display overlay ads on the top of the player regardless of
already present overlay ads that were served through the channel provider’s
stream-embedding code. This is typically achieved by using the spatial
coordinates of  responsible for rendering the Flash video player.
fetches and displays ads from different advertisers on top of the
Flash player. If a user clicks on any of these ads, the website
of the corresponding advertiser is opened, typically redirected
through the ad network’s tracking procedure. The advertiser
will pay the ad network for the visitor, who, in turn, will pay
the publisher (in this case either the channel provider or the
aggregator) based on the pre-negotiated payment model i.e.,
CPT, CTR, or CPC.
B. Monetizing User Views
First and foremost, FLIS services employ deceptive tech-
niques for monetary gains. Millions of users utilize the FLIS
services in order to watch live sport events. As such, earning
money from this massive user base is the key objective
of the FLIS parties. To fulﬁll this objective, FLIS services
make heavy use of substandard and deceptive advertisement
techniques to monetize their business at the expense of user
security. As a case in point, a user of FLIS webpage typically
encounters a number of malicious overlay ads that are stuffed
on the video player. These ads are usually loaded with a num-
ber of deceptive techniques. One such technique is to emboss
