# Author: Ari Juels

## Abstract
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a method of remotely storing and retrieving data using small, inexpensive devices called RFID tags. Products labeled with these tags can be efficiently scanned by readers that do not require line-of-sight. This technology, often seen as a replacement for barcodes, can lead to improved logistics, efficient inventory management, and better customer service.

However, the widespread use of RFID also introduces significant security and privacy risks. Information stored in tags can be easily retrieved by hidden readers, potentially leading to violations of user privacy and the tracking of individuals through the tags they carry.

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of the types, characteristics, and applications of RFID systems. We will then discuss the potential uses and abuses of this technology, detail the attacks that can be applied to RFID systems, and review the countermeasures that have been proposed to date.

## 1. Introduction
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology for automated object identification. An RFID tag is an electronic device consisting of an antenna and an inexpensive chip, often smaller than a grain of rice, which can be read from a distance by a nearby reader. The tag is typically attached to an object and, upon request, returns information related to the tagged item, such as product characteristics, date of manufacture, and date of purchase.

RFID tags can be either passive or active. Passive or semi-active tags derive their power directly from the signal broadcasted by a reader. This ability to draw power from a nearby reader makes passive tags attractive; they do not need batteries, so they can be smaller and cheaper, opening up new and interesting applications. Active tags, on the other hand, have their own power source but are typically more expensive and are used only in specialized applications.

Passive tags are often envisioned as a next-generation barcode technology, automating inventory procedures and cutting costs for manufacturers and retailers. Their two most important characteristics are their small size, which allows them to be implanted within objects, and their ability to be read inside boxes and pallets without requiring line-of-sight. Passive tags are consequently less expensive and offer an unlimited operational lifetime. However, they have shorter read ranges and memory capable of holding only a small amount of information.

Despite these limitations, RFID-tagged items can have remarkable applications. One can imagine a future where passive RFID tags are embedded in every human-made object and even in some natural ones, such as animals or people. This would allow for better tracking of items in complex automated chains and revolutionize distribution networks, enabling goods to be traced from manufacturers to retail stores. This could help companies combat theft and improve the management of stock and inventories in shops or warehouses. Many industries and government agencies in the US, including the Department of Defense, already mandate the use of RFID tags by all of their suppliers [1, 2].

However, the introduction of RFID tags in all objects could also directly benefit the consumer. For example, refrigerators could issue warnings about expired food or remaining bottles of milk. Laundry machines could select washing cycles based on the color and sensitivity of clothes. Waiting times at checkout lines may be drastically reduced since RFID readers can scan tags at rates of hundreds per second. Pharmaceutical products could be checked for being counterfeit or expired, and animals (or more controversially, children) could be located if they are lost.

Despite the increased productivity and convenience, one must consider the social consequences of a world full of tagged items. Will the pervasive use of RFID tags open up the possibility for violating user privacy? Consider, for example, the communication between a tag and a reader. The fact that this communication is wireless and does not require physical contact opens up the possibility for abuse. Currently, RFID tags respond to any reader request within range. Consequently, a person carrying a tagged item effectively broadcasts a fixed identifier to nearby readers. Thus, anyone with a reader can read the information in the tag, potentially violating the owner’s privacy.

To illustrate how this technology can be (ab)used, under today’s barcode technology, an ABC wristwatch sold in Athens has the same barcode as a watch sold in Paris. With RFID, however, each watch carries a unique identification number, which could be tied to a particular person, the buyer of that watch. The person could then be tracked if they ever entered the same store or any other store with an RFID reader on the premises. Eventually, the reader may be able to identify that wristwatch, the time and date it was bought, where it was bought, and how frequently the person visits a particular store.

In general, violation of privacy can take two forms: information leakage and location tracking. The first form involves direct information obtained from a tag that may help in identifying the owner’s preferences and physical condition. For example, information about medication may point to a particular disease, and clothing information may reveal a particular lifestyle. One of the major concerns of privacy advocates is that purchased tagged items would link buyers to specific items in central databases. Marketers could then use this information to build personal profiles and target individuals with specialized sale offers. Even if tag responses are not tied to a particular product, static data can help in tracking the whereabouts of a person. This second form of privacy violation can be achieved by correlating tag "sightings" from multiple readers at fixed locations, allowing people to be tracked by the tags they carry.

The use of RFID tags in products and everyday items offers many benefits for both industry and consumers. However, the concern is that this technology can potentially be abused in numerous ways. Unless changes are incorporated while the technology is still developing, we may suffer the consequences later. In this chapter, we will describe some of the potential uses and abuses of this technology and review in more detail some of the countermeasures that have been proposed to date.

The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a background on RFID technology, detailing the types, operational characteristics, and applications of RFID systems. Section 3 focuses on the security and privacy concerns introduced by the use of this technology and presents possible solutions and countermeasures. It starts by listing a set of requirements that should be true of any secure solution and then presents in more detail the various approaches that have been proposed to date. While this list is not exhaustive, it highlights the issues that need to be considered when providing for secure and anonymous RFID transactions.

## 2. RFID Primer
At the highest level, RFID tags can be characterized as either active or passive. Active tags require a power source and may have a limited lifetime if powered by integrated batteries. Passive tags are of more interest to retailers for several reasons: they exhibit indefinite operational lifetime, require no battery, and can be made small enough to fit almost anywhere. They consist of an antenna, which receives power from a reader and sends back information, and a chip, whose simplest operation is to retrieve a unique ID that identifies the tag.

The simplest approach for implementing a passive tag is near-field coupling. In near-field coupling, a reader first creates a magnetic field in its locality. If the tag is placed in this field, an alternating voltage is generated in the antenna’s coil, which powers the tag’s chip. The data sent back to the reader typically uses load modulation, a technique in which a varying load is applied to the tag’s antenna, resulting in a small change in the current flowing through the reader’s coil. Different modulation techniques can be used depending on the number of bits required in the tag ID and the rate of data transfer. In near-field coupling, the range of communication between the tag and reader is proportional to \( c / (2\pi f) \), where \( c \) is the speed of light and \( f \) is the operational frequency. As \( f \) must be increased to accommodate larger IDs and higher data rates, this technique has certain limitations, and new tags have been developed based on far-field coupling.

In far-field communications, tags are equipped with a dipole antenna, allowing the tags to be outside the reader’s near field and enabling longer communication ranges. The technique used to send data back to the reader is called backscattering, in which some of the reader’s incoming signal is reflected back, allowing the tag to communicate its ID. Far-field tags, with a larger antenna, can achieve better data rates and longer read distances.

Passive tags can operate using a number of frequencies. Low-Frequency (LF) tags operate in the 125–135 kHz range, with a typical read range of less than half a meter and a data rate of a few kbps. High-Frequency (HF) tags operate at 13.56 MHz, with ranges up to a couple of meters and typical data rates of tens of kbps. Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) tags operate in the 860–960 MHz range (and also at 2.45 GHz), with communication distances of up to tens of meters and data rates up to a few hundred kbps. Typically, UHF tags use far-field communications and backscattering, while LF and HF tags use load modulation for tag-to-reader communications.

### 2.1 Standards
There have been many standards in the world of RFID, but two important families include those developed by EPCGlobal and those developed by the International Standards Organization (ISO).

EPCGlobal is a consortium of several companies and universities that created the standards for the Electronic Product Code (EPC). The most important standard from EPCGlobal is the Generation-2 standard, which was created to address the interoperability issues of the Generation-1 standard. Four classes of tags are distinguished within Generation-2, progressively building upon the properties of lower classes. Class 1 refers to write-once, read-many passive tags that carry a unique ID, password-based access control, and a kill switch to deactivate the tag at a point-of-sale. Class 2 extends Class 1 passive tags by allowing rewritable memory and authenticated access control. Class 3 refers to semi-passive tags that carry an integral power source to supplement captured energy. Finally, Class 4 refers to active tags that enable tag-to-tag communication, more complex protocols, and ad hoc networking.

ISO 18000 is a multi-standard that specifies protocols for a number of frequencies, including LF, HF, and UHF. One meeting point between the two families is the incorporation of the EPC Gen-2 Class 1 standard into the new ISO 18000-6 standard. Additionally, two other RFID standards are ISO 14443 and ISO 15693. ISO 14443 was created for proximity cards and RFID tags that operate at short distances, typically in the order of several centimeters. ISO 15693 is a more recent standard for both vicinity cards and RFID tags that typically operate at distances of about 1 meter. Both standards operate in the HF band, while UHF is covered by EPC Gen-2 Class 1.

Another important development in the world of RFID standards is the establishment of the Near-Field Communications (NFC) forum, which aims to integrate mobile phones with existing passive RFID products based on near-field coupling. The NFC standard is compatible with both ISO 14443 and ISO 15693 and allows devices to operate as either a reader or a tag, enabling both transmission and reception of data. One application of this technology is secure device pairing, as a mobile phone can communicate securely with others in the vicinity by exchanging keys without the fear of eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks. A complication of the wide-scale adoption of the NFC standard is its incompatibility with the EPCGlobal standards, which are based on far-field communications.

### 2.2 System Architecture
An example of system architecture consists of a tag, a reader, and a back-end database. RFID tags are relatively cheap, but to achieve greater penetration, their cost must drop to a few cents per tag [3]. Upon a scan request by a reader, the tag responds with a unique ID that is transferred to a back-end infrastructure for further processing. The tag is identified, and specific information about the tagged product can be retrieved by accessing a system database containing all possible tag identifiers.

Communication between tags and readers is wireless and therefore subject to eavesdropping. Most protocols aim to secure this part either by securing tag-to-reader communications or by making tag responses indistinguishable from random data. On the other hand, reader-to-database communications can be assumed to be secure, as both the reader and back-end systems are more powerful and can handle the overhead introduced by encryption. However, the use of encryption should not affect the end-system’s performance. If the back-end database does not have an efficient way to disambiguate the tag among (perhaps) millions of concurrent encrypted tag responses, the database will become a bottleneck, and performance will be lost. Therefore, protocols must be both secure and efficient. Scalability is an important issue that affects protocol design and the choice of cryptographic tools.

Each tag carries a unique number called the Electronic Product Code (EPC). The Header field allows for an expansion of the tag format to 64-, 96-, and 256-bit versions. For the 96-bit format, the EPC Manager field defines the domain manager for the remaining fields. The Object Class describes the generic type of the tagged product, and the Serial Number denotes an individual item number of 36 bits.

This EPC serves as an identifier for the physical object carrying the tag, which can now be recognized, identified, and tracked by the underlying IT infrastructure. Since information about objects should not generally be stored on the tag itself, EPCGlobal has developed a lookup system by which such information can be supplied by distributed servers on the Internet [4]. This system is called the Object Name Service (ONS) and is similar in spirit to the Domain Name System for resolving Internet names. By using this system, it will be possible to let parties dynamically register any kind of EPC Information Service for the objects, such as the main manufacturer, suppliers, shops, or after-sale service providers, thereby opening the way for new business ideas. However, there are some security considerations regarding the ONS [5].
