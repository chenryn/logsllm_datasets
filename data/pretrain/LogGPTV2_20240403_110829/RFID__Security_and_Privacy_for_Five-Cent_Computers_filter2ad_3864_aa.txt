Abstract Radio Frequency IDentiﬁcation (RFID) is a method of remotely storing
and retrieving data using small and inexpensive devices called RFID tags. Products
labeled with such tags can be scanned efﬁciently using readers that do not require
line-of-sight. This form of identiﬁcation, often seen as a replacement of barcode
technology, can lead to improved logistics, efﬁcient inventory management, and ul-
timately better customer service.
However, the widespread use of radio frequency identiﬁcation also introduces
serious security and privacy risks since information stored in tags can easily be re-
trieved by hidden readers, eventually leading to violation of user privacy and track-
ing of individuals by the tags they carry.
In this chapter, we will start by building some background on the types, char-
acteristics, and applications of RFID systems. Then we will describe some of the
potential uses and abuses of this technology, discuss in more detail the attacks that
can be applied to RFID systems and, ﬁnally, review some of the countermeasures
that have been proposed to date.
1 Introduction
Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID) is a new technology for automated object
identiﬁcation. An RFID tag is an electronic device that consists of an antenna and
an inexpensive chip, often smaller than a grain of rice, that can be read from distance
by a nearby reader. This device is typically attached to an object and upon request
it can return information related to the tagged item, such as product characteristics,
date of manufacture, date of purchase, and so on.

RFID tags can be passive or active. Passive or semiactive tags get their power
directly from the signal broadcasted by a reader. This ability to draw power from
a nearby reader is what makes passive tags attractive; they do not need batteries,
so they can be smaller and cheaper opening a new way of interesting applications.
Active tags, on the other hand, have their own power source but are typically more
expensive and are used only in specialized applications.
Tags, of the “passive” variety, are often envisioned as a next-generation bar-code
technology, automating inventory procedures, thus cutting costs for manufacturers
and retailers. Their two most important characteristics are small size, which allows
them to be implanted within objects, and their ability to be read inside boxes, pallets,
etc. which does not require line-of-sight. Passive tags are consequently less expen-
sive and offer an unlimited operational lifetime. The tradeoff is that they have shorter
read ranges and memory capable of holding a very small amount of information.
Despite these limitations, however, RFID tagged items can have remarkable ap-
plications. One can imagine a future where passive RFID tags are in every human-
made object and even in some natural ones (such are animals or even people). This
would allow better tracking of items in complex automated chains and revolutionize
distribution networks, thus permitting goods to be traced from manufacturers to re-
tail stores. This may help companies combat theft or improve management of stock
and inventories in shops or warehouses (many industries and government agencies
in the US, including the Department of Defense, already mandate the use of RFID
tags by all of their suppliers [1, 2]).
However, the introduction of RFID tags in all objects could also directly beneﬁt
the consumer: One could imagine refrigerators issuing warnings about expired food
or about remaining bottles of milk. Laundry machines could select washing cycles
based on color and sensitivity of clothes. Waiting times at checkout lines may be
drastically reduced since RFID readers can scan tags at rates of hundreds per sec-
ond. Pharmaceutical products may be checked for being counterfeit or expired and
animals (or more controversially children) could be retrieved in case they are lost.
Despite this increased productivity and convenience, one must wonder about the
social consequences of a world full of tagged items. Will this pervasive use of RFID
tags open up the possibility for violating user privacy? Consider for example the
communication between tag and reader. The mere fact that this communication is
wireless and does not require physical contact opens up the possibility for abuse.
Currently, RFID tags respond to any reader request within range. Consequently,
a person carrying a tagged item effectively broadcasts a ﬁxed identiﬁer to nearby
readers. Thus anyone with a reader can read the information in the tag, potentially
violating the owner’s privacy.
To see how this new technology can be (ab)used, under today’s bar-code tech-
nology, an ABC wrist watch sold in Athens has the same bar-code as a watch sold
in Paris. With RFID, however, each watch carries a unique identiﬁcation number
which could be tied to a particular person, the buyer of that watch. The person could
then be tracked if he/she ever entered the same store, or if they entered any other
store with an RFID reader at the premises. Eventually, the reader may be able to
identify that wrist watch, the time and date it was bought, where it was bought, and
how frequently one visits a particular store.

In general, violation of privacy can have two forms: information leakage and lo-
cation tracking. The ﬁrst form deals with direct information obtained from a tag
that may help in identifying the owner’s preferences and physical condition. For
example, information about medication may point to a particular disease, clothing
information may reveal a particular life style, and so on. One of the major worries
of privacy advocates is that purchased tagged items would link buyers to these spe-
ciﬁc items in central databases. Marketers could then use this information to build
personal proﬁles and target individuals with specialized sale offers. However, even
if tag responses are not tied to a particular product, static data can help in tracking
the whereabouts of a person. This second form of privacy violation can be achieved
by correlating tag “sightings” from multiple readers at ﬁxed locations. Thus people
can be tracked by the tags they carry!
The use of RFID tags in products and everyday items offers many beneﬁts for
both industry and consumers alike. The concern, however, is that this technology
can potentially be abused in numerous ways. Unless changes are incorporated at a
time when this technology is still developing, we may suffer the consequences later
on. In this chapter, we are going to describe some of the potential uses and abuses
of this technology and review in more detail some of the countermeasures that have
been proposed to date.
The remainder of this chapter is organized as follows: Section 2 aims to build
some background on RFID technology by giving more details about the types, oper-
ational characteristics and applications of RFID systems. Section 3 is the heart of the
chapter; it focuses on the security and privacy concerns introduced by the use of this
technology and presents possible solutions and countermeasures. It starts by listing
a set of requirements that should be true of any secure solution and then presents in
more detail the various approaches that have been proposed to date. While this list
by no means is complete, it serves to highlight the issues that need to be taken into
account when providing for secure and anonymous RFID transactions.
2 RFID Primer
At the highest level, RFID tags can be characterized as either active or passive.
Active tags require a power source and they may have limited lifetime if they are
powered by integrated batteries. Passive tags are of more interest to retailers for
various reasons: they exhibit indeﬁnite operational lifetime, they require no battery,
and they can be made small enough to ﬁt almost everywhere. They consist of an
antenna, that is used to receive power from a reader and send back information to
it, and a chip, whose simplest operation can be that of retrieving a unique ID that
identiﬁes the tag.
The simplest approach for implementing a passive tag is the use of near-ﬁeld
coupling. In near-ﬁeld coupling, a reader ﬁrst creates a magnetic ﬁeld in its locality.
If the tag is placed in such a ﬁeld, an alternative voltage will be generated in the
antenna’s coil, which can be used to power the tag’s chip. The data sent back to the
60
T. Dimitriou
reader typically uses load modulation, a technique in which a varying load is applied
in the tag’s antenna that eventually can be detected by the reader as a small change
in the current ﬂowing through the reader’s coil. Different modulation techniques can
be used depending on the number of bits required in the tag ID as well as the rate of
data transfer. In near-ﬁeld coupling, however, the range of communication between
tag and reader is proportional to c/2πf , where c is the speed of light and f is the
operational frequency. As f must be increased to accommodate for larger IDs and
higher data rates, this technique poses certain limitations and new tags have been
developed that are based on the concept of far-ﬁeld coupling.
In far-ﬁeld communications, tags are equipped with a dipole antenna which al-
lows the tags to be outside the reader’s near ﬁeld, thus allowing for longer commu-
nication ranges. The technique used to send data back to the reader is called back
scattering in which some of the reader’s incoming signal is reﬂected back, thus al-
lowing the tag to communicate its ID. Far-ﬁeld tags, by means of a larger antenna,
can achieve better data rates and longer read distances.
Passive tags can operate using a number of frequencies. Low-Frequency (LF)
tags operate in the 125–135 kHz range; they have a typical read range of less than
half a meter and a data rate of a few kbps. High-Frequency (HF) tags operate at
13.56 MHz, may have ranges up to a couple of meters and typical data rates of
tens of kbps. Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) tags operate in the 860–960 MHz range
(also in 2.45 GHz), they can communicate in distances of up to tens of meters and
achieve rates up to a few hundred kbps. Typically, tags operating in UHF use far-
ﬁeld communications and back scattering while LF and HF tags use load modulation
for tag-to-reader communications.
2.1 Standards
There have been many standards in the world of RFID, however, two important
families include those developed by EPCGlobal and those developed by the Inter-
national Standards Organization (ISO).
EPCGlobal is a consortium of several companies and universities that created the
standards for Electronic Product Code or EPC. The most important standard coming
out from EPCGlobal is the Generation-2 standard that was created to mitigate many
of the issues that limited the success of its Generation-1 standard (mainly interop-
erability issues for tags of the Gen-1 variety). Four classes of tags are distinguished
within Generation-2 that progressively build upon the properties of lower classes.
Class 1 refers to write-once read-many passive tags that carry unique ID, password-
based access control, and a kill switch that can be used in deactivating the tag at
a point-of-sale. Class 2 extends Class 1 passive tags mainly by allowing rewritable
memory and authenticated access control. Class 3 refers to semipassive tags that
carry an integral power source to supplement captured energy. Finally, Class 4 refers
to active tags that enable tag-to-tag communication, more complex protocols, and
ad hoc networking.

ISO 18000 is a multistandard that speciﬁes protocols for a number of frequencies,
including LF, HF, and UHF. One meeting point between the two families is the
incorporation of EPC Gen-2 Class 1 standard in the new ISO 18000-6 standard.
In addition to that, two other RFID standards are ISO 14443 and ISO 15693. ISO
14443 was created for proximity cards and RFID tags that operate at short distances,
typically in the order of several centimeters. ISO 15693, is a more recent standard
for both vicinity cards and RFID tags that typically operate at distances of about
1 m. Both standards operate in the HF band, while UHF is covered by EPC Gen-2
Class 1.
Another important development in the world of RFID standards is the estab-
lishment of the Near-Field Communications (NFC) forum that aims in integrating
mobile phones with existing passive RFID products based on near-ﬁeld coupling.
The NFC standard is compatible with both ISO 14443 and ISO 15693 and allows
devices to operate as either a reader or a tag, thus allowing both transmission and
reception of data. One application of this technology is secure device pairing since,
for example, a mobile phone can communicate securely with others in the vicin-
ity by exchanging keys without the fear of eavesdropping or person-in-the-middle
attacks (physical proximity enhances security since an attacker that is present runs
the danger of being discovered). A complication of the wide-scale adoption of the
NFC standard is its incompatibility with the EPCGlobal standards which are based
on far-ﬁeld communications.
2.2 System Architecture
An example of system architecture is shown in Fig. 1 consisting of a tag, a reader,
and a back-end database. RFID tags are relatively cheap nowadays but in order to
achieve greater penetration their cost must drop to a few cents per tag [3]. Upon a
Fig. 1 System architecture
62

scan request by a reader, the tag responds with a unique ID that is transferred to
a back-end infrastructure for further processing. The tag is identiﬁed and particu-
lar info about the tagged product can be retrieved by means of accessing a system
database containing all possible tag identiﬁers.
Communication between tags and readers is wireless and is therefore subject to
eavesdropping. Thus most protocols aim to secure this part either by securing tag-to-
reader communications or by making tag responses indistinguishable from random
data (we will have to say more about this in Sect. 3). On the other hand reader-to-
database communications can be assumed to be secure since both reader and back-
end systems are more powerful devices and can handle the overhead introduced
by encryption. One issue, however, that needs to be remembered is that the use of
encryption should not affect the end-system’s performance. If the back-end database
does not have an efﬁcient way to disambiguate the tag among (perhaps) millions of
concurrent encrypted tag responses, the database will become the bottleneck and
performance will be lost. Thus protocols must not only be secure but be efﬁcient
as well. Scalability is therefore an important issue that affects protocol design and
choice of cryptographic tools.
Each tag carries a unique number called Electronic Product Code (EPC) as shown
in Fig. 2. The Header ﬁeld allows for an expansion of the tag format to 64-, 96-,
and 256-bit versions. For the 96-bit format shown in Fig. 2, the EPC Manager ﬁeld
deﬁnes the domain manager for the remaining ﬁelds. Object Class describes the
generic type of tagged product and Serial Number denotes an individual item num-
ber of 36-bits length.
This EPC serves as an identiﬁer for the physical object carrying the tag, which
can now be recognized, identiﬁed, and tracked by the underlying IT-infrastructure.
Since information about objects should not in general be stored on the tag itself,
EPCGlobal has developed a lookup system by which such information can be sup-
plied by distributed servers on the Internet [4]. This system is called the Object
Name Service (ONS) and is similar in spirit to the Domain Name System for resolv-
ing Internet names. By using this system it will be possible to let parties dynamically
register any kind of EPC Information Service for the objects, e.g., the main manu-
facturer, suppliers, shops, or after-sale service providers, thereby opening the way
for new business ideas (however, for some security considerations regarding the
ONS, see [5]).

complete, it serves as indicator of how the technology can eventually affect our
every day life activities.
