User: Construct a server monitoring platform, which has the function of automatically discovering and monitoring server status, and provides a graphical display and alarm mechanism. Please design an architectural model of the platform.
Assistant: The architecture model of the platform is as follows: 1. Automatic discovery module: responsible for automatic discovery of newly added servers and adding them to the monitoring list. 2. Monitoring module: responsible for collecting various status indicators of the server, such as CPU usage, disk space, network delay, etc., and storing them in the database. 3. Database module: responsible for storing monitoring data, and providing data query and analysis functions. 4. Display module: responsible for visually displaying monitoring data, including various types of charts, reports, etc. 5. Alarm module: responsible for detecting whether the monitoring data exceeds the preset threshold, and if so, triggers an alarm and sends a notification to the administrator. 6. Management interface module: responsible for providing the management interface after the administrator logs in, which can manage the server list, set alarm rules and other operations. The entire platform can be implemented using a microservice architecture, and each functional module can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, and can also be easily expanded and upgraded. The monitoring module can be implemented using commonly used monitoring tools, such as Zabbix, Prometheus, etc. The display module can be implemented using open source data visualization tools, such as Grafana. The alarm module can be implemented using commonly used alarm tools, such as Nagios, PagerDuty, etc. The database module can use open source relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. The management interface module can be implemented using a web framework, such as Django, Flask, etc.
