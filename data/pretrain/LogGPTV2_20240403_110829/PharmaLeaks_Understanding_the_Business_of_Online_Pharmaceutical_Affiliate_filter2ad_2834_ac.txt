and, while we cannot speak to the quality of the products
we received, we have almost always received a product
in return for our payment [9, 14].
5.1.3 Product Demand
Beyond measuring overall demand, we are particularly
interested in determining what makes up this demand:
which drugs are being purchased, and does this provide
clues about why this market is preferred.
In an effort to reach all customer niches, each of the
programs carries thousands of products. To reason about
this multitude of drugs, we classiﬁed the bulk of the
products into broad categories based on our best assess-
ment (necessarily subjective) of the drug’s use: erectile
dysfunction, pain/inﬂammation, male enhancement (not
ED), mental health, sleep, obesity and other.
Using this classiﬁcation, customer demand for spe-
ciﬁc kinds of drugs in the different programs is striking.
As with the previous time series graphs, Figure 4 shows
weekly revenue for the three afﬁliate programs over time,
9Associated metadata suggests that RX-Promotion’s payment ser-
vice provider (PSP) had arranged for merchant accounts at an Icelandic
bank to be used for RX-Promotion controlled drug payments. However,
on May 10th 2010, a complaint by Visa caused the bank to shut down
these accounts and thus processing for controlled substances was cur-
tailed until August 2nd when the PSP established new accounts for this
purpose with Azeri banks.

had forked the databases in June 2007 (Section 4.1). Af-
ter the fork, GlavMed has very steady growth in orders
until mid-2009, even surpassing SpamIt, and then starts
to decline. Orders to SpamIt plateau for 2008–2009, sim-
ilarly declining in mid-2009.8 RX-Promotion order vol-
umes are considerably more dynamic, for reasons we
will explain later, with totals varying between 1–2 thou-
sand per week across the year of data.
5.1.1 First-time Customers
However, these million plus customers and their pur-
chases do not necessarily constitute the entirety of this
market, but only the portion that has been serviced to
date by these particular programs. This raises the ques-
tion: How saturated is the market for counterfeit pharma-
ceuticals? To evaluate this, Figure 2 shows the cumula-
tive number of unique customers seen in each program
per week over the measurement period. Thus, changes in
slope indicate changes in the rate of new customer ac-
quisition. From these trends it is clear that that the afﬁl-
iate programs are attracting new customers at a steady
rate over time, and that the market does not appear
to be saturating at all. In particular, sister programs
GlavMed and SpamIt attract new customers at nearly the
same rate (3,367/week and 3,569/week on average) while
RX-Promotion, a smaller program, attracts customers at
a slower, but still constant rate (1,429/week on average).
The stability of this growth over time provides some ex-
planation for why spammers continue to blast email in-
discriminately to all Internet users over time: they are
still mining a rich vein of latent customer demand.
8This decline undoubtedly has many roots including increasing
pressure that mounted on SpamIt due to its high visibility (e.g., the
principal owner of SpamIt was identiﬁed by Russian Newsweek as the
World’s Biggest Spammer), shutdowns of large botnets operating as af-
ﬁliates (e.g., the MegaD botnet, which we observed spamming for sites
associated with SpamIt afﬁliate “docent”, ceased operating in Novem-
ber of 2009), and inter-program competition (e.g., starting in 2010,
we see a roughly 15% reduction in the number of active afﬁliates in
the SpamIt program and we witness one large afﬁliate, “anonymouse”,
leaving SpamIt and moving to RX-Promotion during this period).

but here each of the top ﬁve revenue-earning drug cat-
egories is colored distinctly. For GlavMed and SpamIt,
the jokes about spam are spot on: “erectile dysfunction”
(ED) purchases dominate their revenue. Customers do
purchase other notable drugs, but they represent a small
fraction of revenue over time for these programs.
In contrast,
revenue from pain/inﬂammation or-
ders matches revenue from ED in RX-Promotion.
RX-Promotion has a markedly different formulary from
GlavMed and SpamIt, prominently offering products
that GlavMed and SpamIt do not sell. Speciﬁcally,
these include scheduled drugs for pain (Oxycodone, Hy-
drocodone, Vicodin, etc.), mental health (Adderal, Ri-
talin, etc.), and sleep (Valium, etc.), all of which have
high abuse potential.10
These examples suggest that there may in fact be a
range of distinct reasons why different drugs are popu-
lar via this medium. Table 2 summarizes order volume
and program revenue for different groups of drugs sold to
customers by the three afﬁliate programs. Here we merge
our original set of categories into three groups that cor-
respond to different customer motivations for purchas-
ing drugs. The ﬁrst group includes erectile dysfunction
(ED), male enhancement, and related products (includ-
ing fakes such as “Herbal Viagra”). These drugs, some-

times called “lifestyle” drugs, do not address chronic or
acute illness. While they are relatively easy to obtain
under prescription, seekers may prefer the online chan-
nel for reasons of embarrassment or price.11 The sec-
ond group includes drugs that have the potential to be
seriously abused, and includes addictive drugs such as
opiates, depressants, stimulants, etc. For many of these
drugs, customers run substantial legal risk in purchasing
them without prescription, and presumably run this risk
because of a strong desire or need. The third group in-
cludes drugs for treating chronic or acute illnesses. Since
these drugs carry no strong abuse risk, nor represent a
clear cause for social discomfort, we presume that their
purchase is motivated by economics: lower direct drug
costs (which can be substantial) and the absence of indi-
rect costs (for a doctor’s visit). In each category, the table
also lists the top categories or speciﬁc products.
Reﬂecting Figure 4, the ED group dominates items
ordered and revenue to the program, particularly for
GlavMed and SpamIt. For RX-Promotion, though, drugs
with the potential
for abuse are high-revenue or-
ders. Although they comprise just 14% of orders for
11The per-item drug price offered by such programs is frequently
less than 20% of that offered by legitimate retailers. For example, the
median price for 10 tablets of 100mg Sildenaﬁl Citrate was $42.57 on
GlavMed and $23.40 at RX-Promotion. By contrast, according to data
at drugs.com, legitimate brand Viagra in the same amount sells for
$193.99. Note that these prices do not account for shipping, which can
add $15 to $30 per order.

Table 2: Product popularity in each of the three programs. Product groupings and categories are in italics; individual brands are
without italics. Opiates are a further subcategory of Painkillers, and include Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Vicodin, and Percocet.
RX-Promotion, they account for nearly a third of pro-
gram revenue, with the Schedule-II opiates—only avail-
able at RX-Promotion—accounting for a quarter of rev-
enue. Indeed, during the period when RX-Promotion had
working credit card processing for controlled meds, sales
of Schedule II, III and IV drugs produced 48% of all rev-
enue! The fact that such drugs are over-represented in re-
peat orders as well (roughly 50% more prevalent in both
RX-Promotion and, for drugs like Soma and Tramdol, in
SpamIt) reinforces the hypothesis that abuse may be a
substantial driver for this component of demand.
5.1.4 Demographics
Although ED drugs account for the majority of business
for afﬁliate programs, focusing on the remaining prod-
ucts reveals remarkably pronounced age and sex trends
among customers.
Focusing on customers reporting age and sex infor-
mation, Figure 5 shows the percentage of all items or-
dered as a function of age, sex, and detailed product cat-
egory for GlavMed and SpamIt (excluding ED products,
as they would overwhelm the graph). The left half of
each graph shows results for women, and the right half
shows results for men. The y-axis is the self-reported age
of customers, and the x-axis is the percent of all items
these customers ordered. For each age the graphs show
stacked horizontal bars, with segments for the top ten
non-ED product categories.
Both age and sex purchasing patterns emerge from
this visualization. For example, male GlavMed cus-
tomers in Figure 5(a) purchase male pattern baldness
products (peaking between ages 20–30) and male en-
hancement products (peak 45–50), while women pre-
dominantly purchase obesity (peak 40–45) and reproduc-
tive health products (peak 25–30).12 Mental health and
pain/inﬂammation products are roughly equally popular
for men and women, with an older age bias for men.
In contrast to GlavMed, just a few categories predomi-
nate for SpamIt in Figure 5(b): pain/inﬂammation, infec-
tion, and mental health for both men and women, male
enhancement for men. Other categories more popular in
GlavMed, such as acne and male pattern baldness, are
smaller. One explanation is that the differences in prod-
uct popularity correlates with the vector used to adver-
tise the different afﬁliate programs. Since GlavMed is
more likely to be involved in search engine optimiza-
tion (SEO) oriented advertising, they have an opportu-
nity to target narrower markets (e.g., by manipulating
search results for keywords correlated with speciﬁc prod-
uct categories). By contrast, spam is an indiscriminate
advertising medium and customers clicking on spam-
advertised links are predominantly taken to storefronts
advertising ED products. Thus, for these customers to
buy other products would require additional initiative to
search within the site.
5.1.5 Geography
While both afﬁliate programs are located in Russia, most
of their customers are not. Based on customer ship-
ping addresses, we can determine that, across GlavMed
and SpamIt programs, customers from the United States
dominate at 75% of orders, with Canada, Australia, and
populous countries in Western Europe following in sin-
gle digits. Emphatically, Western money fuels these af-
12Interestingly, male customers also purchase the estrogen drug Clo-
mid, which we have come to understand may be explained by body
builders who commonly abuse the drug to counter some of the side-
effects of steroids.

ﬁliate programs with the U.S., Europe, Canada and Aus-
tralia constituting 97% of all orders, consistent with the
breakdown previously observed in [9].13
5.2 Afﬁliates
While customer purchasing drives the online pharmaceu-
tical ecosystem, afﬁliates are the ones who attract and
deliver the customers—and their money—to the online
pharmacies. Afﬁliates operate by commission, receiving
a signiﬁcant fraction (typically 30–40%) of each cus-
tomer purchase that reﬂects the substantial risk they as-
sume in their aggressive advertising activities. Next we
analyze the role afﬁliates play in making online pharma-
ceutical programs successful as a business.
As discussed in Section 4.1.1, we merge separate ac-
counts in the GlavMed and SpamIt databases that belong
to the same afﬁliate. After account merging, during the
2007–2010 measurement period 1,037 afﬁliates were ac-
tive in GlavMed and 305 in SpamIt. Lacking detailed ac-
count proﬁle information in RX-Promotion, we consider
each account a separate afﬁliate. With this assumption,
during the smaller one-year period for RX-Promotion
415 afﬁliates were active.
5.2.1 Program Revenue
GlavMed and RX-Promotion are open afﬁliate programs,
and as such they actively advertise and recruit new afﬁl-
iates to join their programs (with the public advertising
focused on SEO-based advertising vectors). SpamIt, on
13This previous study also identiﬁed substantive differences in the
make-up of drugs purchased in the U.S. vs. other Western countries
(with U.S. customers driving a disproportionate fraction of demand for
non-ED meds). While we still observe this pattern in the SpamIt data
(with the fraction of non-ED meds in U.S. customer orders being 3.8×
larger than for Europe and Canada), it is absent in GlavMed customers,
suggesting that the advertising vector plays a key role in this effect.

revenue for each program.
the other hand, is a closed program—focused speciﬁcally
on email spam—where afﬁliates join by invitation (Sec-
tion 4.1). These models inﬂuence the kinds of afﬁliates
in a program, the impact they have on generating revenue
for a program, as well as the commissions they earn.
Although the programs contain hundreds to thousands
of afﬁliates, most afﬁliates contribute little to the over-
all revenue of the programs. Figure 6 shows the CDFs
of afﬁliate contributions to total program revenue for the
three afﬁliate programs. The x-axis is the percent of af-
ﬁliates, sorted from highest to lowest revenue they gen-
erate for the program, and the y-axis is the percent of
total program revenue. The graph shows that just 10% of
the highest-revenue afﬁliates account for 75–90% of total
