**What is the current behavior?**
I get:
> Warning: Unknown DOM property autocomplete. Did you mean autoComplete?
When I use `autoComplete` works fine.
This is misleading because the name of the DOM property is `autocomplete`, not
`autoComplete`. React implies that the DOM property is named differently than
it really is.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem viahttps://jsfiddle.net or similar
(template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**

**What is the expected behavior?**
Accepts `autocomplete`, rejects `autoComplete`.
_OR_
The error message should not claim that `autoComplete` is the name of a DOM
property because it isn’t. I don’t see any mention of a DOM property called
`autoComplete` in the IDL documentation for `HTMLInputElement`, but I do see
mention of `autocomplete`. It should claim that `autoComplete` is a “React
property name mapped onto a differently-named DOM property” or use some other
wording (I’m not good at coming up with wordings).
    > typeof document.createElement('input').autocomplete
    "string"
    > typeof document.createElement('input').autoComplete
    "undefined"
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
react-15.6.1
Same issue exists for at least `HTMLInputElement.autofocus`.
