Abstract
Black hat search engine optimization (SEO), the practice of abu-
sively manipulating search results, is an enticing method to acquire
targeted user trafﬁc. In turn, a range of interventions—from mod-
ifying search results to seizing domains—are used to combat this
activity. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of these inter-
ventions in the context of an understudied market niche, counterfeit
luxury goods. Using eight months of empirical crawled data, we
identify 52 distinct SEO campaigns, document how well they are
able to place search results for sixteen luxury brands, how this ca-
pability impacts the dynamics of their order volumes and how well
existing interventions undermine this business when employed.

INTRODUCTION
Every new communications medium inevitably engenders a new
form of abuse — telephones led to unsolicited “robocalls”, email
begat spam, and so on. In turn, new mechanisms and policies are
invariably brought to bear to restrict such activities (e.g., spam ﬁl-
ters or, in the U.S., the national do-not-call registry). Today, one
of the most dynamic such conﬂicts is playing out in the medium of
online search.
In particular, as online marketing has become the leading mech-
anism by which sellers of goods and services engage potential con-
sumers online, search engines, such as Google and Bing, have be-
come the primary platform of this engagement. Because search en-
gine results are presented directly in response to user queries, they
offer the opportunity to precisely target consumers at the moment
of their interest. As a testament to this, search engines received
over $16B in revenue in 2012 (46% of the total online advertising
expenditures) for clicks on sponsored advertisements appearing in
their search engine result pages (SERPs) [29].
However, while criminal use of sponsored advertisements oc-
curs, the more fertile ground for abuse is the so-called “organic”
search results, which are unpaid. These results are generated and
ranked automatically based on the content and structure of the visi-
ble Web (e.g., based on the PageRank algorithm, the presence of
user-generated content, etc.) and produce far more click trafﬁc
than sponsored ads. Unsurprisingly, techniques for improving the
ranking of particular Web sites in these organic search results —

termed search engine optimization (SEO) — are extremely popu-
lar. While some SEO techniques are completely benign (e.g., key-
word friendly URLs), quite a few are actively abusive (e.g., the
use of compromised Web sites as “doorway” pages, “cloaking”,
farms of “back links”, etc.). As a result, such “black hat” SEO
campaigns are frequently able to poison search results so that one
or more highly-ranked results for key search terms will direct traf-
ﬁc to their sites. This trafﬁc can then be monetized by infecting
the user with malware [11, 14, 30], defrauding the user via phish-
ing [38], or through the marketing of counterfeit or illegal goods
(e.g., pharmaceuticals [25]).
In this paper, we focus on a range of such SEO campaigns that
are the principal means of marketing for organizations selling coun-
terfeit luxury and lifestyle fashion goods. To wit, at the time of this
writing, typing “cheap louis vuitton” into Google produces a list of
ten results. Fully seven of these are fraudulent and ultimately di-
rect user clicks to storefronts selling counterfeit knockoffs of Luis
Vuitton products. This is no exception and similar search result
poisoning is evident for a range of luxury brand names. Indeed,
the combination of both high demand and high margins (a counter-
feit of a handbag that might retail for $2400 will sell for $250, but
will typically cost as little as $20 to produce) make this a vibrant
and proﬁtable scam; we have evidence that a single fulﬁllment or-
ganization delivered over 250,000 such items over a nine-month
period. However, such actors are not unopposed and there are a
range of interventions they must contend with including labeling
and deranking of their sites by search engine operators, and site or
domain takedowns driven by brand holders. It is understanding the
interplay of SEO campaigns and these interventions that motivates
our research.
Concretely, our paper makes three contributions. First, we pro-
vide the ﬁrst large-scale empirical characterization of SEO abuse
for luxury brands. In particular, we explain how such scams work
(identifying how they differ from existing markets technically and
operationally), analyze their search placement success over time
and, using the prior “purchase pair” technique [16], gather indica-
tors of order ﬂow volumes. Second, we develop a methodology for
using this data to evaluate the impact of interventions on the effec-
tiveness of these SEO campaigns. Finally, we apply our methodol-
ogy to a range of existing anti-counterfeiting actions, identify why
these prior efforts have had limited impact and make suggestions
for improving their utility in the future.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We begin
by describing the background of search engine optimization and
prior research in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the technical
details of how SEO campaigns are structured in the counterfeit lux-
ury market as well as how current interventions by search engines
and brand holders operate and the rationale behind them. Section 4
describes our data set and data collection methodology. Finally,
359in Section 5 we present our ﬁndings and their implications, while
summarizing the most signiﬁcant in the conclusion.
2. BACKGROUND
The term search engine optimization (SEO) covers a broad ar-
ray of techniques, all designed to improve the ranking of organic
search results in popular search engines. Given that the goal of
search engines is to provide high-quality results, only the subset of
these techniques that explicitly aid in search quality are viewed as
benign by search companies. For example, in their “Search Engine
Optimization Starter Guide”, Google suggests things such as us-
ing accurate page titles and the use of the “description” meta tag,
which Google’s ranking algorithms view positively [8]. However,
these benign techniques do not change the underlying Web link
structure, and are insufﬁcient to produce the large-scale changes in
rankings required to capture signiﬁcant trafﬁc for popular queries.
Thus, “black hat” SEO campaigns will typically orchestrate thou-
sands of Web sites operating in unison to achieve their goals. Each
site will present the targeted keywords when visited by a search en-
gine crawler.1 However, when a visitor arrives at such a site via a
targeted search, entirely different content will be revealed (this is
one case of a general technique called “cloaking”). This content
may be native to the site, may be proxied from a third site or, most
commonly, will arise from a redirection to the true site being ad-
vertised. The popularity of this third approach is why such sites are
commonly called “doorways” in the SEO vernacular. Doorways in
turn obtain high-ranking either by mimicking the structure of high
reputation sites (typically by creating backlinks to each other) or by
compromising existing sites and exploiting the positive reputation
that they have accrued with the search engine.
Poisoned search results (PSRs), or search results promoted by
an attacker using black hat SEO with the intent of surreptitiously
amassing user trafﬁc, have been studied for a decade, with one of
the best-known early empirical analyses due to Wang et al. [37].
More modern analyses have covered advances in detecting cloak-
ing and poisoning techniques [19, 22, 27, 35] as well as deeper
studies of the particular campaigns and their operational behav-
ior [15, 36]. These efforts, which identify a range of technical
behaviors implicated in abusive SEO, serve as the foundation for
our own measurement work. However, our goals differ consider-
ably from previous work as we are focused on understanding the
overall business enterprise and through this lens evaluate the efﬁ-
cacy of existing interventions. In this, our work is similar to prior
efforts to understand particular underground economies [16, 17, 18,
25, 34] and the economic issues surrounding various defenses and
interventions [3, 12, 20, 21, 24, 26].
However, the ecosystem around luxury SEO abuse is quite dis-
tinct from these others and, as we will show, there are large differ-
ences in the underlying techniques, business structure, stakeholders
and the kinds of interventions being practiced. Thus, we believe
that our ﬁndings both serve to advance our understanding of how
to best address search abuse, but also to expand our broader un-
derstanding about the interplay between technical countermeasures
and the structure of online criminal enterprises.
3. LUXURY SEO AND INTERVENTIONS
Abusive SEO campaigns, by deﬁnition, can victimize two groups,
users and search engine providers. The former because they may be
convinced to purchase goods or services that are of low quality or

identiﬁes popular crawlers, but some SEO kits also include IP ad-
dress ranges they have associated with the major search engines.
illegal, the latter because their ability to provide high quality search
results is imperiled. However, within the niche of counterfeit lux-
ury goods another potential victim is the luxury brands themselves
(both in terms of lost potential sales and brand damage). Conse-
quently, in addition to interventions from search engines (driven by
general concerns about search quality), brands also drive interven-
tions to protect their economic interests. In this section we discuss
what makes this market distinct, both in terms of how counterfeit
luxury SEO campaign are structured and the kinds of interventions
used in response.
3.1 SEO Campaigns
The SEO campaigns funded by the counterfeit luxury goods mar-
ket operate similarly to other SEO campaigns (see [36] for one such
example), with a couple of noteworthy differences. First, they in-
troduce distinct cloaking and evasion techniques designed to un-
dermine existing defenses. Second, the businesses that ultimately
fund these campaigns appear to be organized differently than the
open afﬁliate marketing programs that have been endemic in prior
studies of underground economics (e.g., counterfeit pharmaceuti-
cals [25], software [24] or FakeAV [34]). We discuss each of these
in turn.
3.1.1 Cloaking
At its essence, cloaking refers to any mechanism for deliver-
ing different content to different user segments. For the purposes
of SEO, cloaking’s primary objective is to deceive search engines
by providing different content to the search engine crawler than to
users clicking on search results. For example, the most widely-used
cloaking technique, called redirect cloaking, arranges that search
engine crawlers (e.g., Googlebot) receive content crafted to rank
well for targeted query terms, while normal users who access the
site are instead redirected to another site hosting a particular scam
(e.g., a storefront selling counterfeit goods). In some cases, particu-
larly when the doorway is on a compromised site, a visitor will only
be redirected after arriving via a search results page. Otherwise,
the original legitimate site content is returned, enabling compro-
mised sites to remain compromised longer by appearing unchanged
to normal visitors.
However, cloaking is a violation of most search engine’s content
guidelines and, when such activity is discovered, the cloaked sites
are typically deranked automatically in search results. As with any
adversarial process, though, attackers adapt to new defenses.
In
contrast to cloaking techniques we have previously observed [35,
36], we have identiﬁed a new method of cloaking, which we call
iframe cloaking, which bypasses traditional means of detection.
In particular, iframe cloaking does not redirect the user and fre-
quently returns the same content to both search engines and users.2
Instead of redirecting a user to a landing store site, the store is sim-
ply loaded within an iframe element on top of the existing door-
way page content. Typically the iframe visually occupies the entire
height and width of the browser to provide the illusion that the user
is browsing the store (Figure 1 shows a simple example of iframe
cloaking using JavaScript). The JavaScript implementation is fre-
quently obfuscated to further complicate analysis and in some cases
the iframe itself is dynamically generated. Taken together, these
countermeasures require any detection mechanism to run a com-
2A complementary feature of iframe cloaking is that it reduces the
requirements for cloaking on compromised sites. Traditional cloak-
ing uses network features (e.g., IP address or user agent) to identify
crawlers, requiring specialized server side code. In contrast iframe
cloaking runs entirely on the client, relying on the assumption that
crawlers do not fully render pages at scale.

plete browser that evaluates JavaScript and fully renders a page (a
set of requirements that greatly increase the overhead of detection
at scale).3 We found the use of iframe cloaking to be pervasive
within the domain of counterfeit luxury, but a more comprehensive
study of the use of iframe cloaking for other domains remains an
open question.
3.1.2 Business structure
Traditionally, a broad range of online scams have been organized
around an afﬁliate marketing model in which an afﬁliate program
is responsible for creating site content, payment processing and
fulﬁllment, while individual afﬁliates are responsible for deliver-
ing the user to storefronts (e.g., via email spam, SEO, etc.). Core
to this business model is the notion that afﬁliates are independent
contractors agents paid on a commission basis, and thus afﬁliate
programs work to attract a diverse set of afﬁliates. This model is
commonly used today in a broad range of scams with a nexus in
Eastern Europe and Russia including pharmaceuticals, pirated soft-
ware, books, music and movies, herbal supplements, e-cigarettes,
term paper writing, fake anti-virus and so on [32].
However, there are many indications (albeit anecdotal) that the
structure of organizations in the counterfeit luxury market are dis-
tinct.4 First, the marketing portion of these scams can span both
an array of brands and types of merchandise. For example, from
inﬁltrating their command and control (C&C) infrastructure using
the same approach as described in previous work [36], we ﬁnd
a single SEO campaign may shill for over ninety distinct store-
fronts selling thirty distinct brands ranging from apparel (Aber-
crombie), luxury handbags (Louis Vuitton), and electronics (Beats
By Dre). Moreover, the same campaign will commonly host lo-
3Even after rendering a page, the ubiquity of iframes in online
advertising make distinguishing benign from malicious content a
challenge.
4There is a range of evidence suggesting that the big counterfeit
luxury organizations have a nexus in Asia, unlike the Eastern Eu-
ropean origin of many other scams. Our evidence includes the use
of Asian language comments in SEO kit source code, the choice of
Asian payment processors, fulﬁllment and order tracking from Asia
and direct experience interviewing an Asian programmer working
for one of these organizations. We surmise that a distinct cyber-
