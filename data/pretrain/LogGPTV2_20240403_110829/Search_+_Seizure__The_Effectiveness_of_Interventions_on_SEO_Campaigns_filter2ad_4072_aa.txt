## Abstract
Black hat search engine optimization (SEO) involves the abusive manipulation of search results to acquire targeted user traffic. Various interventions, from modifying search results to seizing domains, are employed to combat this activity. This paper examines the effectiveness of these interventions in the context of counterfeit luxury goods. Using eight months of empirical data, we identify 52 distinct SEO campaigns, document their ability to place search results for 16 luxury brands, and analyze how these capabilities impact order volumes and the effectiveness of existing interventions.

## 1. Introduction
Every new communication medium inevitably leads to new forms of abuse. For example, telephones led to unsolicited "robocalls," and email led to spam. In response, mechanisms and policies are developed to restrict such activities, such as spam filters or the U.S. national do-not-call registry. Today, one of the most dynamic conflicts is occurring in the realm of online search.

As online marketing has become the primary method for sellers to engage with potential consumers, search engines like Google and Bing have become the main platform for this engagement. Because search engine results are presented directly in response to user queries, they offer the opportunity to precisely target consumers at the moment of their interest. In 2012, search engines generated over $16 billion in revenue (46% of total online advertising expenditures) from clicks on sponsored advertisements [29].

While criminal use of sponsored advertisements does occur, the more fertile ground for abuse is the "organic" search results, which are unpaid. These results are generated and ranked automatically based on the content and structure of the visible Web (e.g., PageRank algorithm, user-generated content). Techniques for improving the ranking of particular websites in these organic search results, known as search engine optimization (SEO), are extremely popular. While some SEO techniques are benign (e.g., keyword-friendly URLs), many are abusive (e.g., compromised websites as "doorway" pages, cloaking, backlink farms). Black hat SEO campaigns can poison search results, directing traffic to sites that monetize through malware, phishing, or the sale of counterfeit or illegal goods.

In this paper, we focus on SEO campaigns used by organizations selling counterfeit luxury and lifestyle fashion goods. For example, a Google search for "cheap Louis Vuitton" often produces a list of ten results, seven of which are fraudulent and direct users to storefronts selling counterfeit products. This is not an isolated case; similar search result poisoning is evident for a range of luxury brand names. The combination of high demand and high margins (a counterfeit handbag that might retail for $2,400 can sell for $250 but cost as little as $20 to produce) makes this a profitable scam. We have evidence that a single fulfillment organization delivered over 250,000 such items over a nine-month period. However, these actors face various interventions, including labeling and deranking of their sites by search engine operators and site or domain takedowns driven by brand holders. Our research aims to understand the interplay between SEO campaigns and these interventions.

Our paper makes three contributions:
1. We provide the first large-scale empirical characterization of SEO abuse for luxury brands, explaining how such scams work, analyzing their search placement success over time, and using the prior "purchase pair" technique to gather indicators of order flow volumes.
2. We develop a methodology for using this data to evaluate the impact of interventions on the effectiveness of these SEO campaigns.
3. We apply our methodology to a range of existing anti-counterfeiting actions, identify why these prior efforts have had limited impact, and make suggestions for improving their utility in the future.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on search engine optimization and prior research. Section 3 describes the technical details of how SEO campaigns are structured in the counterfeit luxury market and the current interventions by search engines and brand holders. Section 4 outlines our data set and data collection methodology. Finally, in Section 5, we present our findings and their implications, summarizing the most significant in the conclusion.

## 2. Background
Search engine optimization (SEO) encompasses a broad array of techniques designed to improve the ranking of organic search results in popular search engines. Given that the goal of search engines is to provide high-quality results, only techniques that explicitly aid in search quality are viewed as benign. For example, Google's "Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide" suggests using accurate page titles and the "description" meta tag, which Google's ranking algorithms view positively [8]. However, these benign techniques do not change the underlying web link structure and are insufficient to produce large-scale changes in rankings required to capture significant traffic for popular queries.

Thus, "black hat" SEO campaigns typically orchestrate thousands of websites operating in unison to achieve their goals. Each site presents targeted keywords when visited by a search engine crawler. When a visitor arrives via a targeted search, entirely different content is revealed (a technique called "cloaking"). This content may be native to the site, proxied from a third site, or, most commonly, arise from a redirection to the true site being advertised. Such sites are commonly called "doorways" in SEO vernacular. Doorways obtain high rankings either by mimicking the structure of high-reputation sites or by compromising existing sites and exploiting their positive reputation with search engines.

Poisoned search results (PSRs), promoted by attackers using black hat SEO, have been studied for a decade, with one of the best-known early empirical analyses due to Wang et al. [37]. More recent studies have covered advances in detecting cloaking and poisoning techniques [19, 22, 27, 35] and deeper studies of specific campaigns and their operational behavior [15, 36]. These efforts, which identify a range of technical behaviors implicated in abusive SEO, serve as the foundation for our own measurement work. However, our goals differ considerably from previous work, as we focus on understanding the overall business enterprise and evaluating the efficacy of existing interventions. Our work is similar to prior efforts to understand particular underground economies [16, 17, 18, 25, 34] and the economic issues surrounding various defenses and interventions [3, 12, 20, 21, 24, 26].

The ecosystem around luxury SEO abuse is distinct from others, and there are large differences in the underlying techniques, business structure, stakeholders, and the kinds of interventions being practiced. Thus, we believe our findings will advance our understanding of how to best address search abuse and expand our broader understanding of the interplay between technical countermeasures and the structure of online criminal enterprises.

## 3. Luxury SEO and Interventions
Abusive SEO campaigns can victimize two groups: users and search engine providers. Users may be convinced to purchase low-quality or illegal goods, while search engine providers' ability to provide high-quality search results is imperiled. In the niche of counterfeit luxury goods, another potential victim is the luxury brands themselves, both in terms of lost potential sales and brand damage. Consequently, in addition to interventions from search engines (driven by general concerns about search quality), brands also drive interventions to protect their economic interests. In this section, we discuss what makes this market distinct, both in terms of how counterfeit luxury SEO campaigns are structured and the kinds of interventions used in response.

### 3.1 SEO Campaigns
The SEO campaigns funded by the counterfeit luxury goods market operate similarly to other SEO campaigns, with a couple of noteworthy differences. First, they introduce distinct cloaking and evasion techniques designed to undermine existing defenses. Second, the businesses that ultimately fund these campaigns appear to be organized differently than the open affiliate marketing programs endemic in prior studies of underground economics (e.g., counterfeit pharmaceuticals [25], software [24], or FakeAV [34]).

#### 3.1.1 Cloaking
Cloaking refers to any mechanism for delivering different content to different user segments. For SEO, the primary objective of cloaking is to deceive search engines by providing different content to the search engine crawler than to users clicking on search results. The most widely-used cloaking technique, called redirect cloaking, arranges for search engine crawlers (e.g., Googlebot) to receive content crafted to rank well for targeted query terms, while normal users who access the site are redirected to another site hosting a particular scam (e.g., a storefront selling counterfeit goods). In some cases, particularly when the doorway is on a compromised site, a visitor will only be redirected after arriving via a search results page. Otherwise, the original legitimate site content is returned, enabling compromised sites to remain compromised longer by appearing unchanged to normal visitors.

However, cloaking is a violation of most search engines' content guidelines, and when such activity is discovered, the cloaked sites are typically deranked automatically in search results. As with any adversarial process, attackers adapt to new defenses. In contrast to cloaking techniques we have previously observed [35, 36], we have identified a new method of cloaking, which we call iframe cloaking, that bypasses traditional means of detection.

Iframe cloaking does not redirect the user and frequently returns the same content to both search engines and users. Instead of redirecting a user to a landing store site, the store is simply loaded within an iframe element on top of the existing doorway page content. Typically, the iframe visually occupies the entire height and width of the browser to provide the illusion that the user is browsing the store (Figure 1 shows a simple example of iframe cloaking using JavaScript). The JavaScript implementation is frequently obfuscated to further complicate analysis, and in some cases, the iframe itself is dynamically generated. These countermeasures require any detection mechanism to run a complete browser that evaluates JavaScript and fully renders a page, significantly increasing the overhead of detection at scale. We found the use of iframe cloaking to be pervasive within the domain of counterfeit luxury, but a more comprehensive study of the use of iframe cloaking for other domains remains an open question.

#### 3.1.2 Business Structure
Traditionally, a broad range of online scams have been organized around an affiliate marketing model, where an affiliate program is responsible for creating site content, payment processing, and fulfillment, while individual affiliates are responsible for delivering users to storefronts (e.g., via email spam, SEO, etc.). Core to this business model is the notion that affiliates are independent contractors paid on a commission basis, and thus affiliate programs work to attract a diverse set of affiliates. This model is commonly used today in a broad range of scams with a nexus in Eastern Europe and Russia, including pharmaceuticals, pirated software, books, music, and movies, herbal supplements, e-cigarettes, term paper writing, fake antivirus, and more [32].

However, there are many indications (albeit anecdotal) that the structure of organizations in the counterfeit luxury market is distinct. First, the marketing portion of these scams can span an array of brands and types of merchandise. For example, from infiltrating their command and control (C&C) infrastructure using the same approach as described in previous work [36], we find that a single SEO campaign may shill for over ninety distinct storefronts selling thirty distinct brands ranging from apparel (Abercrombie), luxury handbags (Louis Vuitton), and electronics (Beats By Dre). Moreover, the same campaign will commonly host multiple storefronts, each with its own unique design and branding, making it difficult for users to detect the underlying connection.

There is a range of evidence suggesting that the big counterfeit luxury organizations have a nexus in Asia, unlike the Eastern European origin of many other scams. Our evidence includes the use of Asian language comments in SEO kit source code, the choice of Asian payment processors, fulfillment and order tracking from Asia, and direct experience interviewing an Asian programmer working for one of these organizations. We surmise that a distinct cyber-criminal ecosystem exists in this region, with specialized roles and structures that differ from those in other regions.
