### NTIA-Approved Communications Networks

The process for agencies to obtain a frequency assignment from the NTIA, and the corresponding data that users must compile, varies depending on whether the proposed Land Mobile Radio (LMR) network is conventional or trunked.

#### Conventional LMR Systems
For users proposing to build or modify a conventional LMR system, the only requirement is to submit frequency application data to the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS). Typically, no additional review is required.

#### Trunked LMR Systems
For users proposing to build or modify a trunked LMR system, the process is more involved. The user must first submit data to the Spectrum Planning Subcommittee (SPS) for a system review and approval. This is followed by a frequency application to the FAS. The purpose of the SPS review is to certify the type of equipment, system operation, appropriate channel loading, and spectrum availability. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11, funding for the system will not be released until the NTIA issues its system certification.

The SPS requires different types of information and varying levels of detail based on the specific trunked LMR system option:
- **Modification of an Existing System:** If an applicant is modifying an existing trunked LMR system, the SPS only requires details on the proposed modification to ensure compliance with NTIA regulations.
- **New Trunked System with Previously Certified Technology:** If the proposed LMR trunking technology has been previously certified, the applicant must submit information to the SPS to certify the operation of the technology in the new environment.
- **New Trunked System with New Technology:** If the technology has not been previously certified, the applicant must submit comprehensive technical and operational systems data to the SPS for review.

### Comparisons of Conventional and Trunked Systems

#### 5.14 Compatibility with Legacy Systems
- **Analog Conventional Systems:** New analog conventional systems are generally compatible with legacy analog configurations, assuming no vendor-to-vendor incompatibilities.
- **Digital Conventional Systems:** Achieving compatibility between current digital conventional systems and legacy analog systems is more challenging. The TIA/EIA-102 suite of standards is the only open standard that addresses over-the-air compatibility with legacy analog LMR systems. TIA/EIA-102 Phase I requirements provide over-the-air compatibility of Phase I conventional digital equipment with legacy conventional analog equipment.
- **Digital Trunked Systems:** These systems typically use a gateway technique for migration from analog systems. The new system is installed as an overlay, and a connection (gateway) is created between the old and new networks at the baseband (audio) level, allowing both systems to work simultaneously and facilitating a gradual transition.

Hybrid systems, which consist of conventional and trunked overlays, inherit the compatibility considerations of their respective components.

#### 5.15 Required User Discipline
- **Conventional Networks:** Users must actively monitor the channel and wait for it to become free before communicating. This requires significant user discipline to avoid call congestion and blocking.
- **Trunked Networks:** Users do not need to monitor the system for available channels; the network controller handles this. When a user presses the Push-to-Talk (PTT) button, the trunking controller assigns a channel if one is available, or places the user in a waiting queue based on priority. Trunked networks require less user involvement but still need discipline to prevent misuse and overloading.

Hybrid networks combine the discipline requirements of both conventional and trunked systems.

#### 5.16 Network Management
- **Conventional Networks:** Network management includes maintaining components, managing user groups, upgrading components, managing encryption, operating over-the-air features, optimizing performance, and ensuring intersystem interoperability. Most conventional networks lack automated management functions, requiring more manual oversight.
- **Trunked Networks:** In addition to the tasks mentioned above, trunked network management involves more complex configuration and planning. Proper allocation and management of talk groups are critical to avoid degrading network performance. Network management also includes setting conversation time-out features to prevent overloading.

Hybrid networks manage both conventional and trunked overlays, applying the relevant management practices to each component.

#### 5.17 Network Operator Training
- **Conventional Networks:** Training for operators and dispatchers is relatively simple and often provided in-house. Larger systems may require more detailed knowledge.
- **Trunked Networks:** Training can be more complex due to the size and automation of these networks. Maintenance personnel must undergo extensive training, often provided by manufacturers as part of the original contract.

Operators and maintenance personnel in hybrid networks should be trained to handle both conventional and trunked systems.

#### 5.18 Network Cost Effectiveness
Cost effectiveness depends on various factors, including mission, number of users, user group sizes, available spectrum, coverage requirements, terrain, call setup delay, data transmission needs, security, and interoperability. While conventional systems generally have lower upfront costs, cost efficiency is determined by the specific technology, configuration, and user options, not just the architecture type.

#### 5.19 Considerations for Migration to Trunking
- **Cost:** The initial cost of migrating to a trunked system can be high, but advanced technologies can offer per-user savings and additional benefits like data transmission and enhanced security.
- **Spectrum Availability:** Migrating to trunking below 800 MHz involves legislative and technical challenges, including obtaining consent from other licensees and meeting specific service area requirements.
- **Channel Allocation:** Legacy channels assigned for simplex operation may not be suitable for half or full-duplex operations needed for trunking, requiring customized installations and potentially doubling installation costs.
- **Multi-Agency Collaboration:** Teaming up with neighboring jurisdictions can provide combined channel resources, economies of scale, and better interoperability.

### Summary
The most significant difference between conventional, trunked, and hybrid architectures is the network load capacity, particularly for systems with more than 60 users. Trunking allows for serving more users with the same amount of spectrum, making it a valuable solution as spectrum becomes scarcer.
