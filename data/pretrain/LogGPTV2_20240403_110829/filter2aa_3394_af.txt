NTIA-approved communications networks.  The process that agencies must follow and the
corresponding data that users must compile for submission to the NTIA to receive a frequency
assignment differ depending on whether the proposed LMR network is conventional or trunked.
Users proposing to build or modify a conventional LMR system must only submit
frequency application data to the IRAC Frequency Assignment Subcommittee (FAS).  No other
review is usually required.
Users proposing to build or modify a trunked LMR system must submit data to the SPS
for a system review and approval.  This is followed by frequency application to the FAS
frequency application review.  The purpose of the system review is to certify the type of
equipment, system operation, appropriate channel loading and spectrum availability.  The Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-11 states that funding for the system will not be
released until the NTIA issues its system certification.  The SPS requires different types of
information and varying levels of detail for each trunked LMR system option.  For example, if an
applicant is proposing to modify an existing trunked LMR system, the SPS requires information
only on the details of the proposed modification to ensure that it is compliant with NTIA
regulations, rather than extensive information on the entire system, because the system has
already been certified.  If an applicant is proposing to build a new trunked system, the applicant
must determine if the proposed LMR trunking technology has been previously certified.  If the
technology has been previously certified, the applicant must submit information to the SPS to
certify the operation of the technology in the proposed environment.  If the technology has not
been previously certified, the applicant must submit technical and operational systems data to the
SPS for review. [11]

5.14 Compatibility with Legacy Systems
In the simplest case, new analog conventional systems are compatible with legacy analog
configurations (assuming the absence of vendor-to-vendor incompatibilities).  However,
achieving compatibility between current digital conventional systems and legacy analog system
represents a challenge.  Of the open standards, TIA/EIA-102 is the only suite of standards that
has addressed over-the-air compatibility with legacy analog LMR systems.  TIA/EIA-102 Phase I
requirements provide over-the-air compatibility of Phase I conventional digital equipment with
legacy conventional analog equipment.
Digital trunked systems usually employ a gateway technique for migration from analog
systems.  The technique consists of installing the new system as an overlay and creating a
connection (gateway) between the old and the new network using the baseband (audio) level to
make them interoperable.  This way, both systems can work simultaneously, allowing a gradual
transition to the new system.
Since hybrid systems consist of conventional and trunked overlays, all compatibility
considerations that apply to the two systems individually will be correct for the respective
overlays of a hybrid system.
5.15 Required User Discipline
As mentioned previously, an essential characteristic of conventional systems is that only
one user can communicate over a half-duplex channel at a time.  To circumvent call congestion
and blocking, users must actively monitor or listen to the channel and wait for it to become free.
If a conversation between two users is ongoing, the user must maintain discipline and avoid
interrupting the conversation.  Consequently, conventional networks require a significant amount
of user discipline on the part of each radio user to ensure that all the users on the network are
able to share the channel.  A conventional network does not make use of a network controller and
control channel to identify a free channel within the overall network.
Users on trunked networks do not have to monitor the system for an available channel to
make a call.  The network does it for them.  After the PTT button is pushed, depending on user’s
access priority level, the trunking controller:
1. Assigns the user a channel, if there is one available
2. If none is available and the user requires a priority access, puts the user in the
beginning of a waiting queue.  If the user does not require a priority access, puts the
user in the end of the queue.
3. When a channel is assigned, the user is usually notified by the radio audibly.
Consequently, trunked networks do not require any user involvement to select an
available channel and do not require channel-sharing discipline from their users as in

conventional systems.  They do require patience during system busy times waiting for a free
channel.  Nonetheless, other types of network discipline that prevent misuse and possible
overloading of a trunked network, such as unauthorized or overly long telephone and two-way
calls, are critical to efficient operation of trunked networks.  Most trunked systems provide built-
in system management capabilities to prevent these violations.
Since hybrid networks consist of conventional and trunked overlays, all network
considerations that apply to the two systems individually will be correct for the respective
overlays of a hybrid network.
5.16 Network Management
Network management of a conventional network includes maintaining network
components, allocating and managing user groups (also known as talk groups) among available
channels, upgrading network components when necessary, managing encryption capabilities,
managing and operating over-the-air features, optimizing performance, and managing
intersystem interoperability.  These network management responsibilities are not unique to
conventional networks when compared with other types of LMR configurations.  Since most
conventional networks do not make use of computer logic to handle network operation, they
require more manual management and have fewer automated management functions than trunked
networks.
Network management of a trunked network also includes maintaining network
components, upgrading network components when necessary, managing encryption capabilities,
managing and operating over-the-air features, optimizing performance, and managing
intersystem interoperability.  Compared with conventional network management, trunked
network management requires more complex network configuration and planning.  Depending
on organizational mission and user requirements, a choice of network trunking type (transmission
or conversation trunking) must be made with associated hang and time-out times.  Allocating and
managing talk groups on a trunked network has a greater importance, since, if done improperly, it
can degrade network performance and capacity to a great degree, similar to assigning too many
users to a conventional channel.  To control misuse that may lead to network overloading, such
as unauthorized or overly long telephone and person-to-person calls, network management has to
establish a conversation time-out feature, or use network accounting.
Since hybrid networks consist of conventional and trunked overlays, all network
management considerations that apply to the two systems individually will be correct for the
respective overlays of a hybrid network.

5.17 Network Operator Training
Depending on a particular system configuration, training of conventional network
operators/dispatchers is not complex and is provided by many agencies in-house.  Nonetheless,
larger conventional systems may require a greater and more detailed knowledge of system
configuration than in trunked systems.  Many public safety professional associations have mini
courses that provide operator training.  Network maintenance personnel must understand basic
radio communications principles and are trained either in-house or by a manufacturer.
Training of trunked network operators/dispatchers is not much more complex and
sometimes it is even easier than conventional networks training
Although sometimes provided by many agencies in-house, due to the large size,
complexity, and degree of automation of some trunked networks, network maintenance personnel
must undergo extensive training and frequent updates.  Usually, such training is available from
radio system manufacturers and is a often part of the original contract.  The training typically
includes fundamentals of radio communications, trunked network configuration and
maintenance, base station and console equipment maintenance and testing, and maintenance and
troubleshooting of the wired-to-wireless link.  The duration of the training can be from two to
four weeks depending on the complexity of the system, technical background of the individuals,
and the degree of familiarity with the particular technology.
Since hybrid networks consist of conventional and trunked overlays, dispatch and
maintenance personnel should be trained to operate and maintain both types of systems.

5.18 Network Cost Effectiveness
The cost effectiveness of a particular architecture can be determined only on a case-by-
case basis, since it depends on many case-specific considerations and conditions.  Among the
considerations that need to be taken into account when building and costing a system are the
following:
• Mission
• Number of users
• Number of user groups
• User group sizes
• Available spectrum
• Coverage requirements
• Type of terrain
• Acceptable call setup delay
• Data transmission requirements
• Security and encryption requirements
• Interoperability requirements
• Available interconnect options.
Some very general comparisons of estimated costs associated with network capacity
versus cost performance are given in Exhibit 13.  The assumptions and mathematical capacity
considerations are attached in Appendix C.
The results of this comparison show that although conventional architecture cost is
generally lower than that of trunked, cost efficiency is determined most by technology used,
specific configuration, and user options selected, not by type of architecture.

5.19 Considerations for Migration to Trunking
One of the most important considerations when migrating to a trunked system is usually
cost.  As was concluded in the previous section, the type of architecture does not greatly affect
the cost of a system.  Cost is largely a function of a technology choice (analog versus digital,
lower bands versus 800 MHz, FDMA versus TDMA), specific configuration (simulcast,
multicast, zone-type), and selected user options (roaming, encryption, over-the-air rekeying, etc.).
As shown in Exhibit 13, the estimated difference in the upfront costs of legacy and state-of-the
art networks is so significant (between 400 and 2400 percent) that many organizations often have
difficulty finding necessary funds10.  Nonetheless, with some advanced technologies, when
network cost is calculated on a per-user basis, it can be lower than that in legacy systems by up to
40 percent, even though the advanced network provides all the benefits of new technology,
including data transmission, encryption, and security.  Per-user savings are achieved because the
advanced networks have the capacity to handle a much greater number of users than the legacy
systems.
Beside the financial hurdles, there are legislative and technical considerations concerning
available spectrum that make migration to trunking on frequencies below 800 MHz difficult.
Decentralized trunked networks, in which radios scan the available channels and find one that is
clear, have been used on the lower LMR bands since the 1970s.  Now, centralized trunked
networks are also permitted on frequencies between 150 and 512 MHz (except 220-222 MHz), if
the following requirements are met (per FCC Second Report and Order FCC 97-61 [PR Docket
No. 92-235 adopted on February 20, 1997 and released on March 12, 1997]; see 90.187 of 47
CFR):

The licensee has an exclusive service area (470-512 MHz band only); or

The licensee does not have an exclusive service area, but obtains consent from all
licensees who have co-channel and/or adjacent channel stations as follows:
2.1 
Trunking will be permitted by the FCC on frequencies where applicant or

Consent also has to be obtained from licensees with service areas (Exhibit 15)
that overlap a circle with radius 113 km (70 mi.) from the proposed base
station.  (For more information see 90.205 of 47 CFR).  Or, alternatively,
applicants may submit an engineering analysis based upon generally accepted
engineering practices and standards, which demonstrates that the service area
of the trunked network does not overlap any existing stations whose service
areas overlap a circle with radius 113 km (70 mi.) from the proposed base
station.

The consensual agreements among licensees must specifically state the terms agreed
upon and a statement must be submitted to the FCC indicating that all licensees have
consented to the use of trunking.

Trunking of networks licensed on paging-only channels or licensed in the
Radiolocation Service is not permitted by the FCC.
Currently, no provisions allow LMR licensees in the bands below 470 MHz to obtain an
exclusive service area.  The FCC proposed that some form of exclusivity be allowed in the
shared LMR bands below 470 MHz, but has not yet ruled on this issue.  Licensees operating in
the 470-512 MHz band may obtain an exclusive service area if they meet requirements in the
Exhibit 16.

Meeting all these licensing requirements in order to migrate to a trunked network in the
bands below 800 MHz could be a difficult and time-consuming process unless a decentralized
trunked network is proposed.
Another hurdle to migration to trunked is the allocation of legacy channels.  The channels
that were assigned for simplex operation are sometimes not suitable for half and full duplex
operation which is necessary for trunking.  To suppress unwanted harmonics, intermodulation,
and general interference between forward and reverse frequencies, transmit and receive (T-R)
frequencies should have a minimum specified separation, usually greater than 1 MHz (potentially
much greater and increasing with frequency).  In the VHF band, where a significant percentage of
frequencies was licensed for simplex communications, T-R separations are inconsistent, with
some as small as 120 kHz. These spacings require customized installations with separate
antennas and costly notch-and-pass filters targeted at specific frequencies.  In these cases, off-

the-shelf equipment with broad pass bands can rarely be used with satisfactory results, causing
increased cost.  This problem also exists in the UHF band.  In the UHF band, where T-R
separation of a given channel is typically 5 MHz, T-R splits can still be as little as 500 kHz as
multiple channels may be in operation at a single site.  While co-channel and adjacent channel
interference concerns are not as great as in the VHF band, due to smaller propagation range on
these frequencies, network designers must still provide customized installations in the UHF band
to account for site-specific requirements.  Again, these installations usually include separate
antennas and costly filtering equipment.  The comparison of installation costs of filtering
equipment in these bands done by the PSWN program [6] shows that cost would likely double
due to insufficient T-R separation.
Another spectrum issue arises when migrating to a trunked network.  The number of
frequencies is, in many cases, insufficient for optimizing load capacity of a trunked network.  As
shown in Appendix B, the capacity improvement from trunking increases as the number of
channels increases.  If a system has only two or three channels, the improvement is insignificant.
As discussed in earlier chapter, if multiple sites are needed for coverage and a zone-type trunked
architecture is used for a network, the total number of channels required by the network will be
calculated as N*R, where N is number of channels per site and R is a frequency reuse ratio
(typically 4 or 7).  A 5-channel network with a frequency reuse ratio of four, for example, needs
20 channels.  If it is a centralized trunked network, one of the channels at each site is used for
control and the traffic is handled by the remaining four channels.  In many cases agencies do not
have access to additional channels in the lower LMR frequency bands and they employ
simulcast-type of trunked system design.  Simulcast networks have significantly lower user
capacity than zone-type networks and are significantly more expensive, since the transmitters at
each site need to be phase-locked to minimize interference in overlapping coverage areas,
requiring additional equipment.
Agencies sometimes resolve many of the migration issues by teaming up with
neighboring jurisdictions and agencies and pooling their spectrum and financial resources.  A
multi-agency/multi-jurisdiction approach for building trunked LMR networks offers significant
benefits:
• Combined channel resources provide a better trunking capacity improvement
• Economies of scale allow a lower per user investment
• Often the organizations work on adjacent or shared channels, making it easier to gain
exclusivity for these channels
• A multi-jurisdictional network provides a wider coverage area for each of the
jurisdictions
• Better communications interoperability results among agencies on one network.

SUMMARY
The most significant difference between conventional, trunked, and hybrid architectures
is network load capacity for systems with greater than 60 users (mission specific).  The analysis
conducted for this report determined that other considerations were not affected by the choice of
network architecture type to the same degree.  Typically, trunking allows a system to serve more
users with the same amount of spectrum or less.  Since spectrum has become a scarce resource,
this property of trunking will drive its use in the future.
