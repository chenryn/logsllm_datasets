Case Study: AT&T Overreporting. As discussed in Section 2,
AT&T notified the FCC this year that it had mistakenly reported
fixed coverage with speeds ≥ 25 Mbps in over 3,500 census blocks [21].
We randomly select 20 blocks from AT&T’s notice and manually
examine the blocks in our BAT coverage dataset to understand
whether our methods could have identified the overreporting. For
12 of the blocks, our analysis dataset does not include any addresses.
For 5 of the blocks, AT&T’s BAT responded that all the addresses
were either not covered or were covered at speeds below 25 Mbps.
In the remaining 3 blocks, we find at least one address where the
AT&T BAT indicated service of at least 25 Mbps (though in one of
the blocks, 95% of addresses either lacked service or had coverage
at speeds below 25 Mbps). Based on this limited analysis, we believe
our methods have promise as a means of validating ISP coverage
filings: in this known instance of overreporting, our dataset indi-
cated problems with 17 of the 20 census blocks we evaluated. We
note, though, that this case study also suggests that our method for
identifying possible overreporting may be too conservative—our
method would have filtered out nearly all the blocks in our sample.
4.2 Overstatements of Speed by ISP
In this section, we examine speed overstatements for the four ISPs
from which our client collects speed data. We continue with the
method described in Section 4.1 for labeling addresses with cov-
erage. For each address in our dataset that we label as covered by
the ISP according to the FCC, we set the FCC maximum download
speed to the maximum speed for that ISP in that block according to
Form 477 data. For each address that we label as covered according
to our BAT data, we set the BAT maximum download speed to the
maximum speed our client observed when querying the ISP’s BAT
for the address. Fig. 5 shows the resulting distributions of address
maximum speeds, further subdivided by urban and rural areas.
For every ISP, the Form 477 data overstates the broadband speeds
provided to residential addresses. Across ISPs, the median speed

available is 25 Mbps in our dataset, in comparison to 75 Mbps in
the Form 477 data. The discrepancy between BAT speed data and
FCC speed data is especially pronounced for CenturyLink and Con-
solidated. We also observe that for all the ISPs except CenturyLink,
speed overstatements are larger in rural areas than in urban areas.
We present coverage overstatements at different speed lower
bounds in Appendix H.
4.3 Overstatements of Any Coverage
We now turn to estimating overstatements of any broadband cover-
age. Table 5 presents a comparison of the addresses and population
in each state that have have access to broadband service, according
to the FCC’s data and our BAT dataset. We arrive at these figures
with a method analogous to the analysis in Section 4.1.
For each state, we begin with the census blocks in our dataset
where at least one major or local ISP provides service (see Sec-
tion 3.2). We then filter out census blocks where there is at least
one major ISP and the response to every BAT query, across every
address-ISP combination, is address unrecognized or response un-
known. We take this conservative filtering step because we have
less confidence in our address data for these census blocks. This step
excludes 2.2% of the census blocks in our dataset, encompassing
0.8% of the population represented in the dataset.
We next generate coverage labels for addresses. For each address
in the remaining census blocks, we label the address as covered by
broadband service according to our BAT data if it meets one of the
following criteria:
• There is at least one major ISP that covers the address ac-
