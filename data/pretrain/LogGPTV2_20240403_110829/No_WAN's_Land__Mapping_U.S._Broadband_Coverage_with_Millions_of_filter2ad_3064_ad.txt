### Figure 5: Distributions of Maximum Service Speed Across Addresses, According to FCC Data and BAT Responses (Section 4.2)

#### Case Study: AT&T Overreporting
As discussed in Section 2, AT&T informed the FCC this year that it had erroneously reported fixed broadband coverage with speeds ≥ 25 Mbps in over 3,500 census blocks [21]. To evaluate whether our methods could have identified this overreporting, we randomly selected 20 census blocks from AT&T’s notice and manually examined them using our BAT coverage dataset.

- **For 12 of the blocks**, our analysis dataset did not include any addresses.
- **For 5 of the blocks**, AT&T’s BAT responses indicated that all addresses were either not covered or were covered at speeds below 29 Mbps.
- **In the remaining 3 blocks**, at least one address was reported by the AT&T BAT as having service of at least 25 Mbps. However, in one of these blocks, 95% of the addresses either lacked service or had coverage at speeds below 25 Mbps.

Based on this limited analysis, our methods show promise for validating ISP coverage filings. In this known instance of overreporting, our dataset indicated issues with 17 out of the 20 census blocks we evaluated. However, this case study also suggests that our method for identifying possible overreporting may be too conservative, as it would have filtered out nearly all the blocks in our sample.

### 4.2 Overstatements of Speed by ISPs

In this section, we examine the overstatements of broadband speeds for the four ISPs from which our client collects speed data. We continue with the method described in Section 4.1 for labeling addresses with coverage.

- **FCC Maximum Download Speed**: For each address in our dataset labeled as covered by the ISP according to the FCC, we set the FCC maximum download speed to the maximum speed for that ISP in that block, as reported in Form 477 data.
- **BAT Maximum Download Speed**: For each address labeled as covered according to our BAT data, we set the BAT maximum download speed to the maximum speed observed when querying the ISP’s BAT for the address.

Figure 5 shows the resulting distributions of maximum speeds, further subdivided by urban and rural areas. For every ISP, the Form 477 data overstates the broadband speeds provided to residential addresses. The median speed available in our dataset is 25 Mbps, compared to 75 Mbps in the Form 477 data. The discrepancy between BAT speed data and FCC speed data is particularly pronounced for CenturyLink and Consolidated. Additionally, for all ISPs except CenturyLink, speed overstatements are larger in rural areas than in urban areas. A detailed comparison of coverage overstatements at different speed lower bounds is provided in Appendix H.

### 4.3 Overstatements of Any Coverage

We now turn to estimating overstatements of any broadband coverage. Table 5 presents a comparison of the addresses and population in each state that have access to broadband service, according to the FCC’s data and our BAT dataset. We use a method analogous to the analysis in Section 4.1.

#### Methodology
For each state, we start with the census blocks in our dataset where at least one major or local ISP provides service (see Section 3.2). We then filter out census blocks where there is at least one major ISP and the response to every BAT query, across every address-ISP combination, is "address unrecognized" or "response unknown." This conservative filtering step is taken because we have less confidence in our address data for these census blocks. This step excludes 2.2% of the census blocks in our dataset, encompassing 0.8% of the population represented in the dataset.

Next, we generate coverage labels for addresses. For each address in the remaining census blocks, we label the address as covered by broadband service according to our BAT data if it meets one of the following criteria:
- There is at least one major ISP that covers the address according to the BAT data.

Table 5 summarizes the results, showing the number of residential addresses and the population covered by broadband service, as reported by the FCC and our BAT data.
