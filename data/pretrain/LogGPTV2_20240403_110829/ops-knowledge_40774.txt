User: Is it possible to define a function in commandline window of Matlab? Looks no to me.
But for R, it is possible to do so. I was wondering why there is this difference and if there is more to say behind this kind of feature of a programming language, or can I say just interpretive language (such as Python, Bash,...)?
Thanks!
Assistant: This isn't really a feature of a programming language but of an implementation of that programming language. For example, there exist C interpreters and Lisp Compilers. This is normaly called an REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) and is generally a feature of interpreted implementations.
