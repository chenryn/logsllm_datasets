: aggregable. The signature size is measured asymptotically or in terms of the number of group elements it is made
of (for constant-size credentials); q indicates the number of attributes embedded in the credentials and v the number of times the credential may be shown
unlinkably.
: sequentially aggregable,
a) Short and aggregable signatures: The Waters sig-
nature scheme [52] provides the bone structure of our prim-
itive, and introduces a clever solution to aggregate multiple
attributes into short signatures. However, the original Waters
signatures do not allow blind issuance or unlinkability, and
are not aggregable as they have not been built for use in a
multi-authority setting. Lu et al. scheme, commonly known
as LOSSW signature scheme [36], is also based on Waters
scheme and comes with the improvement of being sequentially
aggregable. In a sequential aggregate signature scheme, the
aggregate signature is built in turns by each signing authority;
this requires the authorities to communicate with each other
resulting in increased latency and cost. The BGLS signature [9]
scheme is built upon BLS signatures and is remarkable because
of its short signature size—signatures are composed of only
one group element. The BGLS scheme has a number of desir-
able properties as it is aggregable without needing coordination
between the signing authorities, and can be extended to work
in a threshold setting [8]. Moreover, Boneh et al. show how
to build veriﬁably encrypted signatures [9] which is close to
our requirements, but not suitable for anonymous credentials.
b) Anonymous credentials: CL Signatures [16], [35]
and Idemix [6] are amongst the most well-known building
blocks that inspired applications going from direct anonymous
attestations [21], [5] to electronic cash [18]. They provide blind
issuance and unlikability through randomization; but come
with signiﬁcant computational overhead and credentials are
not short as their size grows linearly with the number of
signed attributes, and are not aggregable. U-Prove [41] and
Anonymous Credentials Light (ACL) [4] are computationally
efﬁcient credentials that can be used once unlinkably; therefore
the size of the credentials is linear in the number of unlinkable
uses. Pointcheval and Sanders [43] present a construction
