    class MyClass {
      constructor(@Attributes() atts: Map)
    }
    //Originally, @Attribute('foo') returns Map.get('foo'), now support @Attribute() to return the Map.
PS: About `@attribute()` vs `@attribute`, since all decorators from angular
has parentheses and according to the developer guides: 'Always include the
parentheses! Always call @Injectable(). Our application will fail mysteriously
if we forget the parentheses.' So I think we should use `@attribute()`
