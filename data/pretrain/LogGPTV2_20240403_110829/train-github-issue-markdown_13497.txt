In issue #1818, we discussed and submitted a pull request (PR) in #5140. However, due to the ongoing rewrite of the compiler, the PR cannot be rebased at this time. @tbosch, please take note.

The proposed changes involve the following class:

```typescript
class MyClass {
  constructor(@Attributes() atts: Map<string, any>) {}
}
```

Originally, `@Attribute('foo')` would return `atts.get('foo')`. The updated proposal now supports `@Attribute()` to return the entire `Map`.

**Note on Decorator Syntax:**

Regarding the use of `@attribute()` versus `@attribute`, all Angular decorators should include parentheses. This is consistent with the developer guidelines, which state: "Always include the parentheses! Always call `@Injectable()`. Our application will fail mysteriously if we forget the parentheses." Therefore, we should use `@attribute()` to adhere to these best practices.
