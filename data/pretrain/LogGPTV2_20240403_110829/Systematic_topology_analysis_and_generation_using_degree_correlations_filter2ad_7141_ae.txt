the HOT graph. The 2K constraints start pushing the high-
degree nodes away to the periphery, while the lower-degree
nodes migrate to the core, and the 2K-random graph be-
gins to resemble the HOT graph. The 3K-random topology
looks remarkably similar to the HOT topology.
Of course, visual inspection of a small number of randomly
generated graphs is insuﬃcient to demonstrate our ability
to capture important metrics of the HOT graph. Thus,
we compute the diﬀerent metric values for each of the dK-
random graph and compare them with the corresponding
value for the original HOT graph. In Table 8 and Figures 8
and 9 we see that the dK-series converges more slowly for
HOT than for skitter. Note that we do not show cluster-
ing plots because clustering is almost zero everywhere: the
HOT topology has very few cycles; it is almost a tree. The
1K-random graphs yield a poor approximation of the origi-
nal topology, in agreement with the main argument in [19].
Both Figures 3 and 9 indicate that starting with d = 2, low-
but not high-degree nodes form the core: betweenness is
approximately as high for nodes of degree ∼ 10 as for high-
degree nodes. Consequently, the 2K-random graphs provide
a better approximation, but not nearly as good as it was for
skitter.5 However, the 3K-random graphs match the orig-
5The speed of dK-series convergence depends both on the
structure and size of an original graph G. It must converge
faster for smaller Gs of similar structure. However, here we
see that the graph structure plays a more crucial role than
its size. The dK-series converges slower for HOT than for
skitter, even though the former graph is an order of magni-
tude smaller than the latter.

inal HOT topology almost exactly. We thus conclude that
the dK-series captures the essential characteristics of even
particularly diﬃcult topologies, such as HOT, by suﬃciently
increasing d, in this case to 3.
6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
While we feel our approach to topology analysis holds sig-
niﬁcant promise, a number of important avenues remain for
further investigation. First, one must determine appropri-
ate values of d to carry out studies of interest. Our experi-
ence to date suggests that d = 2 is suﬃcient to reproduce
most metrics of interest and that d = 3 faithfully repro-
duces all metrics we are aware of for Internet-like graphs.
It also appears likely that d = 3 will be suﬃcient for self-
organized small-worlds in general. This issue is particularly
important because the computational complexity of produc-
ing dK-graphs grows rapidly with d. Studies requiring large
values of d may limit the practicality of our approach.
In general, more complex topologies may necessitate de-
veloping algorithms for generating dK-random graphs with
high d’s. We needed higher d to describe the HOT topology
as accurately as the skitter topology. The intuition behind
this observation is that the HOT router-level topology is
“less random” because it results from targeted design and
engineering. The skitter AS-level topology, on the other
hand, is “more random” since there is no single point of ex-
ternal human control over its shape and evolution. It is a
cumulative result of local decisions made by individual ASes.
A second important question concerns the discrete nature
of our model. For instance, we are able to reproduce 1K-
and 2K-distributions but it is not meaningful to consider re-
producing 1.4K-distributions. Consider a graph property X
not captured by 1K but successfully captured by 2K.
It
could turn out that the space of 2K-random graphs over-
constrains the set of graphs reproducing X. That is, while
2K-graphs do successfully reproduce X, there may be other
graphs that also match X but are not 2K-graphs.
Fundamental to our approach is that we seek to repro-
duce important characteristics of a given network topology.
We cannot use our methodology to discover laws governing
the evolutionary growth of a particular network. Rather, we
are restricted to observing changes in degree correlations in
graphs over time, and then generating graphs that match
such degree correlations. However, the goals of reproducing
important characteristics of a given set of graphs and dis-
covering laws governing their evolution are complementary
and even symmetric.
They are complementary because the dK-series can sim-
plify the task of validating particular evolutionary mod-
els. Consider the case where a researcher wishes to validate
a model for Internet evolution using historical connectiv-
ity information. The process would likely involve starting
with an initial graph, e.g., reﬂecting connectivity from 5
years ago, and generating a variety of larger graphs, e.g.,
reﬂecting modern-day connectivity. Of course, the resulting
graphs will not match known modern connectivity exactly.
Currently, validation would require showing that the graph
matches “well enough” for all known ad hoc graph proper-
ties. Using the dK-series however, it is suﬃcient to demon-
strate that the resulting graphs are dK-random for an ap-
propriate value of d, i.e., constrained by the dK-distribution
of modern Internet graphs (with d = 3 known to be suf-
ﬁcient in this case). As long as the resulting graphs fall
in the dK-random space, the theory of dK-randomness ex-
plains any variation from ground truth. This methodology
also addresses the issue of deﬁning “well enough” above:
dK-space exploration can quantify the expected variation
in ad hoc properties not fully speciﬁed by a particular dK-
distribution.
The approaches are symmetric in that they both attempt
to generate graph models that accurately capture values
of topology metrics observed in real networks. Both ap-
proaches have inherent tradeoﬀs between accuracy and com-
plexity. Achieving higher accuracy with the dK-series re-
quires greater numbers of statistical constraints with in-
creasing d. The number of these constraints is upper-bound-
ed by nd (the size of dK-distribution matrices) times the
number of possible simple connected d-sized graphs [28].6
6Although the upper bound of possible constraints increases
Achieving higher accuracy with network evolution model-
ing requires richer sets of system-speciﬁc external parame-
ters [6]. Every such parameter represents a degree of freedom
in a model. By tuning larger sets of external parameters,
one can more closely match observed data. It could be the
case that the number of parameters required to character-
ize the evolution of the Internet is smaller than the number
of constraints required by the dK-series (this remains to be
seen). However, with the dK-series, the same set of con-
straints applies to any network, including social, biological,
and physical. With evolution modeling, one must develop a
separate model for each network.
Directions for future work all stem from the observation
that the dK-series is actually the simplest basis for statisti-
cal analysis of correlations in complex networks. We can in-
corporate any kind of technological constraints into our con-
structions. In a router-level topology, for example, there is
some dependency between the number of interfaces a router
has (node degree) and their average bandwidth (between-
ness/degree ratio) [19]. In light of such observations, we can
simply adjust our rewiring algorithms (Section 4.1.4) to not
accept rewirings violating this dependency. In other words,
we can always consider ensembles of dK-random graphs sub-
ject to various forms of external constraints imposed by the
speciﬁcs of a given network.
Another promising avenue for future work derives from
the observation that abstracting real networks as undirected
graphs might lose too much detail for certain tasks. For
example, in the AS-level topology case, the link types can
represent business AS relationships, e.g., customer-provider
or peering. For a router-level topology, we can label links
with bandwidth, latency, etc., and nodes with router man-
ufacturer, geographical information, etc. Keeping such an-
notation information for nodes and links can also be use-
ful for other types of networks, e.g., biological and social.
We can generalize the dK-series approach to study networks
with more sophisticated forms of annotations, in which case
the dK-series would describe correlations among diﬀerent
types of nodes connected by diﬀerent types of links within
d-sized geometries. Given the level of constraint imposed
by d = 2 and d = 3 for our studied graphs and recognizing
that including annotations would introduce signiﬁcant addi-
tional constraints to the space of dK-graphs, we believe that
2K-random annotated graphs could provide appropriate de-
scriptions of observed networks in a variety of settings.
Finally, all graphs generated in this paper are the same
size as a given graph G. We are working on appropriate
strategies of rescaling the dK-distributions.
7. CONCLUSIONS
Over the years, a number of important graph metrics
have been proposed to compare how closely the structure of
two arbitrary graphs match and to predict the behavior of
topologies with certain metric values. Such metrics are em-
ployed by networking researchers involved in topology con-
struction and analysis, and by those interested in protocol
and distributed system performance. Unfortunately, there
is limited understanding of which metrics are appropriate
rapidly, sparsity of dK-distribution matrices increases even
faster. The result of this interplay is that the number of non-
zero elements of dK-distributions for any given G increases
with d ﬁrst but then quickly decreases, and it is surely 1 in
the limit of d = n, cf. the example in Section 3.
for a given setting and, for most proposed metrics, there are
no known algorithms for generating graphs that reproduce
the target property.
This paper deﬁnes a series of graph structural properties
to both systematically characterize arbitrary graphs and to
generate random graphs that match speciﬁed characteristics
of the original. The dK-distribution is a collection of distri-
butions describing the correlations of degrees of d connected
nodes. The properties Pd, d = 0, . . . , n, comprise the dK-
series. A random graph is said to have property Pd if its
dK-distribution has the same form as in a given graph G.
By increasing the value of d in the series, it is possible to
capture more complex properties of G and, in the limit,
a suﬃciently large value of d yields complete information
about G’s structure.
We ﬁnd interesting tradeoﬀs in choosing the appropri-
ate value of d to compare two graphs or to generate ran-
dom graphs with property Pd. As we increase d, the set of
randomly generated graphs having property Pd becomes in-
creasingly constrained and the resulting graphs are increas-
ingly likely to reproduce a variety of metrics of interest. At
the same time, the algorithmic complexity associated with
generating the graphs increases sharply. Thus, we present a
methodology where practitioners choose the smallest d that
captures essential graph characteristics for their study. For
the graphs that we consider, including comparatively com-
plex Internet AS- and router-level topologies, we ﬁnd that
d = 2 is suﬃcient for most cases and d = 3 captures all
graph properties proposed in the literature known to us.
In this paper, we present the ﬁrst algorithms for construct-
ing random graphs having properties P2 and P3, and sketch
an approach for extending the algorithms to arbitrary d. We
are also releasing the source code for our analysis tools to
measure an input graph’s dK-distribution and our genera-
tor able to produce random graphs possessing properties Pd
for d < 4.
We hope that our methodology will provide a more rig-
orous and consistent method of comparing topology graphs
and enable protocol and application researchers to test sys-
tem behavior under a suite of randomly generated yet ap-
propriately constrained and realistic network topologies.
