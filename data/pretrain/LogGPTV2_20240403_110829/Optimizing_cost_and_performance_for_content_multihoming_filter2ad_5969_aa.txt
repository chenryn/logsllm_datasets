## Abstract
Multihoming is a common practice for large enterprises and stub ISPs to connect to the Internet, offering benefits in reliability, cost, and performance. In this paper, we design and evaluate a series of novel smart routing algorithms to optimize both cost and performance for multihomed users. Our algorithms are evaluated through both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, using realistic charging models, traffic demands, performance data, and network topologies. The results indicate that these algorithms effectively minimize costs while improving performance. We also examine the equilibrium performance of smart routing in a global setting, showing that a smart routing user can enhance its performance without negatively impacting other users.

## 1. Introduction
Multihoming is widely used by large enterprises and stub ISPs to connect to the Internet due to its perceived benefits in reliability, cost, and performance. A customer or ISP network (referred to as a user) with multiple external links (either to a single ISP or different providers) is said to be multihomed. When a user actively controls how its traffic is distributed among its multiple links to the Internet, it is referred to as implementing smart routing, also known as route optimization or intelligent route control.

Smart routing offers several potential benefits:
1. **Improved Network Performance and Reliability**: Recent studies have shown that network-level routing often yields suboptimal user performance due to routing hierarchy and BGP policy routing. Equipment failure, transient instability, and network congestion can also affect user performance. Smart routing allows end users to exercise more control over their routes.
2. **Reduced Financial Cost**: Considering specific charging models, smart routing can potentially reduce users' financial costs. Economic analyses suggest that smart routing can benefit both end users and service providers.

Despite the potential benefits, many commercial products for smart routing lack transparency in their technical details, and their performance and impact on the Internet are not well understood. Previous research has focused primarily on network performance, with little consideration given to users' costs. Additionally, the design of practical algorithms to achieve these benefits remains an open question.

In this paper, we develop a series of novel algorithms to optimize both cost and performance for multihomed users. We first demonstrate that optimizing network performance alone can significantly increase a user's cost, making smart routing less attractive. To address this, we propose offline and online routing algorithms to minimize a user's cost under common usage-based charging models. Using realistic pricing data and traffic demand traces from universities and enterprises, we show that our online algorithm can significantly reduce a user's cost compared to using dedicated links or applying round-robin or equal-split algorithms to burstable links.

We also design offline and online algorithms to optimize network performance under cost constraints. Using realistic pricing data, traffic demand traces, and latency traces, we show that our online algorithm achieves performance within 10–20% of the optimal offline algorithm.

We assume that the user is already multihomed to a set of ISPs, focusing on how to dynamically assign traffic among them to optimize cost and performance. Other factors such as ease of management, troubleshooting, security, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) are not addressed in this paper but are critical in real-world applications.

Our key contributions include:
- Designing offline and online algorithms to minimize cost based on realistic usage-based charging models.
- Designing offline and online algorithms to optimize network performance under cost constraints.
- Using both analysis and simulations based on realistic traffic and performance data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
- Evaluating the performance of smart routing when multiple users selfishly optimize their own cost and performance, finding that smart routing traffic interacts well with other traffic under traffic equilibria.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work. Section 3 discusses our network and charging models. Section 4 presents novel cost optimization algorithms. Section 5 focuses on optimizing network latency under given cost constraints. Section 6 describes our evaluation methodology and results. Section 7 examines the global effects of smart routing and its interactions with other traffic. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper and discusses future work.

## 2. Related Work
Several recent studies have highlighted that Internet routing often yields suboptimal user performance due to factors such as routing hierarchy, policy routing, and slow reaction to transient network congestion or failures. These observations have generated significant research interest in providing end-users with more control over route selection.

## 3. Network and Charging Models
### 3.1 Network Model
A multihomed user has multiple links to the Internet for sending and receiving traffic, as illustrated in Figure 1. The implementation techniques for distributing traffic differ for outgoing and incoming traffic. For outgoing traffic, a border router inside the user’s network can actively control traffic distribution. For incoming traffic, a user can use NAT or DNS to control the routes. Our focus is on determining when and how much traffic should be assigned to each link, making our algorithms applicable to various multihoming implementations.

### 3.2 Charging Models
Users pay ISPs based on the amount of traffic they generate. The cost function \( c(x) \) is typically piece-wise linear and non-decreasing, where \( x \) is the charging volume. Common charging models include percentile-based and total-volume based charging.

- **Percentile-Based Charging**: This scheme records the traffic volume during every 5-minute interval. At the end of a charging period, the q-th percentile of all 5-minute traffic volumes is used as the charging volume \( x \). For example, if 95th-percentile charging is used and the charging period is 30 days, the cost is based on the traffic volume sent during the 8208-th sorted interval.
- **Total-Volume Based Charging**: This straightforward model uses the total volume of traffic generated during the entire charging period as the charging volume \( x \).

We primarily focus on percentile-based charging, using two sets of pricing functions for evaluation. The first set includes simple pricing functions, and the second set includes more complex step functions, reflecting general pricing practices.

### 3.3 Network Performance Metric
We use end-to-end latency as the primary metric for network performance. Latency not only reflects network response time but also serves as a measure of availability.

## 4. Cost Optimization Algorithms
We present novel offline and online algorithms to minimize a user's cost under common usage-based charging models. Our algorithms are designed to handle fluctuations in traffic and provide significant cost reductions compared to traditional methods.

## 5. Performance Optimization Under Cost Constraints
We design offline and online algorithms to optimize network performance while adhering to cost constraints. Our algorithms achieve performance within 10–20% of the optimal offline algorithm, as demonstrated through realistic simulations.

## 6. Evaluation Methodology and Results
We use both theoretical analysis and extensive simulations to evaluate our algorithms. Realistic pricing data, traffic demand traces, and latency traces are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms in minimizing cost and optimizing performance.

## 7. Global Effects of Smart Routing
We study the global effects of smart routing, including the interactions between multiple smart routing users and the impact on other traffic. Our results show that smart routing improves performance without degrading the performance of other traffic.

## 8. Conclusion and Future Work
In conclusion, we have developed and evaluated a series of novel algorithms to optimize both cost and performance for multihomed users. Our algorithms effectively minimize costs and improve performance, and they interact well with other traffic under traffic equilibria. Future work will focus on extending these algorithms to consider additional factors such as ease of management, security, and QoS.
