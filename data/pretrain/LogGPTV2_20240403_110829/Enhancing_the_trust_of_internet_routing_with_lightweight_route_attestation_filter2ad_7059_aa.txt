## Abstract
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) has a weak trust model that introduces significant vulnerabilities, including active malicious attacks and unintended misconfigurations. Despite various secure BGP solutions, the complexity of security enforcement and data-plane attacks remain unresolved. We propose TBGP, a trusted BGP scheme that aims to achieve high authenticity in internet routing with a simple and lightweight attestation mechanism. TBGP introduces a set of route update and withdrawal rules. If correctly enforced by each router, these rules can guarantee the authenticity and integrity of route information announced to other routers. An attestation service running on each router allows neighboring routers to challenge the integrity of its routing stack, enforced rules, and the attestation service itself. Successful attestation ensures the validity of route information, enabling transitive trust among all routers on a routing path. Our prototype implementation uses identity-based signatures and trusted computing techniques to reduce security operation complexity. Security analysis and performance studies show that TBGP achieves BGP security goals with better convergence performance and lower computational overhead compared to existing secure BGP solutions.

## I. Introduction
The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the primary interdomain routing protocol connecting different IP networks or autonomous systems (ASes) to form the Internet. In standard BGP, ASes announce their route information with different prefixes, but neighboring ASes cannot validate this information, leading to potential propagation of forged routes. This weak trust model is a fundamental security weakness, as it allows for large-scale network connectivity issues due to configuration errors or malicious attacks. For example, in February 2008, Pakistan Telecom (AS17557) made an unauthorized announcement of the prefix 208.65.153.0/24, which was forwarded by PCCW Global (AS3491), resulting in the global hijacking of YouTube traffic.

To address these issues, several security-enhanced BGP solutions have been proposed, broadly categorized into cryptography-based prevention and anomaly detection. Cryptographic approaches like SBGP and SoBGP use a centralized routing registration authority and public key infrastructure (PKI) to ensure the authentication of routing announcements. However, these solutions are insufficient against data-plane attacks and often require significant router resources, impacting routing convergence. Anomaly detection approaches aim to identify underlying hijacks but often generate false positives and require manual intervention.

In this paper, we introduce TBGP, a trusted BGP scheme that minimizes computational costs while achieving BGP security goals. TBGP enforces well-defined route update and withdrawal rules through filters in each BGP router. These rules ensure compliance with the BGP specification, providing automatic route authenticity and preventing the spread of forged routes. To ensure correct rule enforcement, TBGP includes an attestation service that allows neighboring routers to challenge the integrity of the routing stack, enforced rules, and the attestation service itself. Successful attestation builds a transitive trust relationship among routers, significantly reducing computation and network resources compared to traditional secure BGP approaches.

## II. Background and Design Goals

### A. BGP Security Threats
Current BGP is vulnerable to attacks from misconfigured speakers or intercepted unauthorized BGP sessions, leading to routing anomalies and Internet disruptions. BGP speakers cannot verify the origins of announcements, allowing them to announce any prefix not belonging to their AS. Similarly, they cannot validate the AS path of received announcements, potentially redirecting traffic to incorrect or malicious destinations. Common BGP attacks include prefix hijacks and invalid path attacks.

- **Prefix Hijacks:** These can be complete prefix or subprefix hijacks. A complete prefix hijack occurs when an AS announces itself as the origin of a prefix it does not own, causing neighboring ASes to reroute traffic to the hijacker.
- **Invalid Path Attacks:** These occur when the AS path includes fake AS numbers, making it difficult to detect relationships between ASes and thus hard to identify invalid paths.

### B. Related Work
Several security-enhanced BGP solutions have been proposed, generally falling into two categories: cryptographic algorithms and anomaly detection mechanisms. Cryptographic approaches like SBGP, SoBGP, psBGP, and SPV use PKI and aggregated signatures to authenticate ASes and AS_PATHs. However, these solutions often have high computational and memory costs. SoBGP and psBGP, while improving some aspects, still struggle with real-world application scenarios and data-plane attacks.

Anomaly detection approaches like IRV, Listen and Whisper, PGBGP, iSPY, and NetReview monitor route announcements to detect anomalies. However, they often generate false positives and require manual intervention. Some recent approaches, such as N-BGP, use trusted third parties and trusted computing to enforce route attestation rules, but they are typically deployed in BGP monitors rather than individual BGP speakers.

## III. Proposed BGP Route Rules
TBGP introduces a set of well-defined route update and withdrawal rules to ensure the authenticity and integrity of route information. These rules are enforced by filters in each BGP router along the routing path. The enforcement of these rules guarantees that route announcements comply with the BGP specification, providing automatic route authenticity and preventing the spread of forged routes.

## IV. Implementation Details
Our prototype implementation of TBGP uses trusted computing (TC) technologies to securely store private keys in each router and bind the integrity of router software and the correct enforcement of BGP rules with authorized signing operations using protected keys. We also use identity-based signatures (IBS) to eliminate the need for centralized certificate management and reduce runtime security operation overhead.

## V. Performance Evaluation
Experimental studies and simulations show that TBGP introduces minimal delay in route selection and announcement, with an average of 2 ms per-prefix. Simulations indicate that TBGP has significantly lower performance overhead and resource consumption compared to existing secure BGP approaches, with at least 1.25 times improvement in convergence time and 9.26 times in memory consumption.

## VI. Deployment Issues
We discuss the challenges and considerations for deploying TBGP in real-world scenarios, including the integration with existing BGP infrastructure and the potential for incremental deployment.

## VII. Conclusion
TBGP offers a practical and efficient solution for enhancing the trust of internet routing with a lightweight attestation mechanism. By enforcing well-defined route update and withdrawal rules and using trusted computing and identity-based signatures, TBGP achieves high authenticity and integrity in BGP, with minimal computational and network resource overhead.
