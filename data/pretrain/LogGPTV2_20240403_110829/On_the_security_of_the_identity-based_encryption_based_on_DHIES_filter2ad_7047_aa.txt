ABSTRACT
In ASIACCS 2010, Chen, Charlemagne, Guan, Hu and Chen
proposed an interesting construction of identity-based en-
cryption based on DHIES, whose key extraction algorith-
m makes use of the multivariate quadratic equation. They
proved that their scheme is selective-ID secure against cho-
sen ciphertext attack, i.e. secure in the sense of IND-sID-
CCA. Unfortunately, in this paper, we demonstrate that Chen
et al.’s scheme is insecure in the sense of IND-sID-CCA by
showing that the private key extraction algorithm of their
scheme can be exploited to apply XL algorithm, which is
to solve the multivariate quadratic (MQ) problem (under
certain conditions).

INTRODUCTION
In 1984, Shamir [17] introduced the notion of identity-
based cryptography to simplify key management by avoid-
ing the use of digital certi(cid:12)cates by letting a public key be
publicly derivable from identities, which can be any arbi-
trary string, such as an email address or a telephone num-
ber. More precisely, in order to generate a corresponding
private key associated with a given identity, a trusted Pri-
vate Key Generator (PKG) must compute the private key
by using the knowledge of a master secret key. This paradig-
m avoids the complicated key management problems arising
in traditional public key infrastructures as it eliminates the
need for certi(cid:12)cates and some of the problems associated
with them. Hence, identity-based cryptography supports
lightweight environment, in comparison to the traditional
public key infrastructure. However, the dependence on a P-

KG who uses a system-wide master key to generate private
keys inevitably introduces the inherent problem in identity-
based cryptosystems, namely the key escrow problem.
In an identity-based encryption, an encryptor is only re-
quired to know who is allowed to decrypt a ciphertext. It
is up to the decryptor to obtain the required key from the
trusted PKG. In other words, an identity-based cryptosys-
tem allows an encryptor to encrypt a message directed to
a decryptor even prior to the decryptor retrieving the as-
sociated private key from the PKG. This \feature" enables
interesting applications, such as access control that is de-
(cid:12)ned by a logical formulae of conjunctions and disjunctions
[19].
In [17], Shamir proposed a concrete construction of identity-
based signature, but the construction of identity-based en-
cryption remained as an open problem. Subsequently, two
similar identity-based encryption based on pairings were in-
dependently proposed by Sakai, Ohgishi and Kasahara [16]
and by Boneh and Franklin [7], followed afterwards by a
completely di(cid:11)erent scheme by Cocks [10]. Since 2000, many
improvements have been attained to the original scheme pro-
posed by Boneh and Franklin, and new techniques have also
been proposed (e.g. [14, 6, 5, 20]). For a complete overview
of the improvements on identity-based encryption, we refer
the readers to [8]. Interestingly, most of the schemes incor-
porate in one way or another upon the notion of bilinear
pairings.
A more recent development of identity-based encryption
schemes has been made using lattice-based cryptography
[12, 15]. Lattice-based cryptography has attracted many at-
tentions in the cryptographic community since it has promised
a futuristic solution towards combating quantum computers
ability [18], and hence the notion of post-quantum cryp-
tography [4]. Additionally, code-based cryptography, hash-
based cryptography and multi-variate cryptography have al-
so been identi(cid:12)ed as the potential primitives in the post-
quantum cryptography era [4].
Very recently,
in ASIACCS 2010, Chen, Charlemagne,
Guan, Hu and Chen [9] proposed an interesting construction
of identity-based encryption based on the DHIES (Di(cid:14)e-
Hellman Integrated Encryption) [3, 1] with multivariate quadrat-
ic key combination structure and bilinear maps. The scheme
is very e(cid:14)cient and it requires only one pairing computation
during public key generation, and there is no special hash
function required. Interestingly, they also provided a brief of
security analysis based on the multivariate quadratic prob-
lem. Furthermore, the scheme is proven selective ID-secure
[5] against chosen ciphertext attack, i.e. IND-sID-CCA se-
cure, in the random oracle model assuming DHIES is chosen
ciphertext secure. Moreover, they also claimed that their ex-
tract algorithm constitutes a short signature scheme, which
is of an independent interest.
Our Contribution. In this paper, we provide a cryptanal-
ysis of Chen et al.’s scheme [9]. In contrast to the claimed
result in [9], we show that the proposed identity-based en-
cryption scheme is not IND-sID-CCA secure. The insecurity
arises from the KeyGen algorithm, which uses the multi-
variate quadratic equation to derive private keys. We show
that due to the (cid:13)exibility in making a number of private
key extraction queries, the KeyGen algorithm can success-
fully exploited by the method proposed in [11]. We envision
that the only (cid:12)x for the scheme to be secure is to have it an
unreasonably large public parameter.
Road-map. The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Sec. 2, we recall some background that will be required
throughout this paper. In Sec. 3, we provide a review on
Chen et al.’s identity-based encryption scheme [9] from ASI-
ACCS 2010. In Sec. 4, we demonstrate that the scheme is
not IND-sID-CCA secure. Sec. 5 concludes the paper.
2. PRELIMINARIES
2.1 Admissible Bilinear Maps
Let k be a security parameter and q be a k-bit prime
number. Let us consider groups G1 and G2 of the same
prime order q. A bilinear map e : G1 × G1 → G2 satis(cid:12)es
the following properties:
• Bilinearity: ∀P, Q ∈ G1, ∀a, b ∈ ZZ
∗
q , we have e(aP, bQ) =
e(P, Q)ab.
• Non-degeneracy: ∀P ∈ G1, e(P, P ) ̸= 1.
• Computability: ∀P, Q ∈ G1, e(P, Q) can be e(cid:14)ciently
computed.
As demonstrated in [7], such non-degenerate admissible map-
s over cyclic groups can be obtained from the Weil or the
Tate pairing over algebraic curves.
2.2 Identity-based Encryption
We review the formal de(cid:12)nition of identity-based encryp-
tion introduced in [7].
Setup:
is a probabilistic algorithm run by a private key
generator (PKG) that takes as input a security parameter
to output a public/private key pair for the PKG, denoted
by (Ppub, mk).
KeyGen: is a key generation algorithm run by the PKG on
input a master key mk and a user’s identity ID to output the
user’s private key dID.
Encrypt: is a probabilistic algorithm that takes as input a
plaintext M , a recipient’s identity ID and the PKG’s public
key Ppub to output a ciphertext C.
Decrypt: is a deterministic decryption algorithm that takes
as input a ciphertext C and the private decryption key dID to
return a plaintext M or a symbol Reject if C is an invalid
ciphertext.

2.3 Security Notions
In the following, we review the de(cid:12)nition of selective i-
dentity, adaptively chosen ciphertext security of an identity-
based encryption scheme de(cid:12)ned in [9].
Definition 1. An identity-based encryption scheme is said
to be selective identity, adaptively chosen ciphertext secure
(IND-sID-CCA) if no PPT adversary A has a non-negligible
advantage in the following game.
Init. A outputs an identity IDch which it wishes to be chal-
lenged on.
Setup. The challenger runs the Setup algorithm. It pro-
vides the adversary the resulting system parameters params.
It keeps the master-key to itself.
Phase 1. A issues queries q1,··· , qm where query qi is one
of the following
· Extraction query (IDi) where IDi ̸= IDch. The chal-
lenger responds by running the algorithm KeyGen to
generate the private key di corresponding to the iden-
tity IDi. It sends di to the adversary.
· Decryption query (IDi, Ci). The challenger respond-
s by running the algorithm KeyGen to generate the
private key di corresponding to IDi. Then, it runs the
algorithm Decrypt to decrypt the ciphertext Ci using
the private key di. It sends the resulting plaintext to
the adversary.
Challenge. Once the adversary decides that Phase 1 is
over, it outputs two equal length plaintext M0, M1 on which it
wishes to be challenged. The challenger picks a bit c ∈ {0, 1}
and sets the challenge ciphertext C =Encrypt( params,
IDc, Mc). It sends C as the challenge to the adversary.
Phase 2. The adversary issues additional queries qm+1,··· , qn
where qi is one of the following
· Private key query IDi ̸= ID. The challenger responds
the same as in Phase 1.
· Decryption query (IDi, Ci) ̸= (IDch, C). The challenger
responds the same as in Phase 1.
These queries may be asked adaptively as in Phase 1.

Guess. Finally, the adversary outputs a guess c
and wins if c = c
2.4 Multivariate Quadratic Problem
The multivariate quadratic (MQ) problem can be de(cid:12)ned
as follows [21]. Let P1,··· , Pm be m polynomials of n vari-
ables over Fq, each of which has the form
Pt(x1,··· , xn) =
β(t)

, γ(t) ∈ Fq for all 1 ≤ t ≤ m. The MQ prob-
where β(t)
lem, denoted as MQ(q, n, m), is the problem of solving for
indeterminate xi ∈ Fq of the random system of m Multivari-
ate Quadratic equations yt = Pt(x1,··· , xn) for 1 ≤ t ≤ m.

3. REVIEW ON CHEN ET AL.’S IDENTITY-
BASED ENCRYPTION
The essence of Chen et al.’s scheme [9] is in the KeyGen
algorithm. In order to generate a key pair for a given ID,
the KeyGen algorithm (cid:12)rst maps ID to a set S of indices,
then the PKG computes the linear combination of some se-
cret elements related to S as the private key, while everyone
can compute the corresponding combination of the public
elements related to S as the public key. The idea seems s-
traightforward, but Chen et al. observed that the linear key
combination structure will make the construction vulnerable
to collusion attack. Therefore, they suggested to use a non-
linear key combination structure [9]. The resulting scheme
is based on DHIES with multivariate quadratic combination
structure. The complete description of the scheme is as fol-
lows. In the following description, a symmetric key scheme
SE = (Ks,Es,Ds) is used, where Es(k,·) and Ds(k,·) denote
symmetric encryption and decryption under the key k, re-
spectively.
Setup. Given a security parameter k ∈ ZZ+, and the PKG
scale ℓ, the algorithm works as follows.
• Run G on input k to generate a prime q, two groups
G1 =, G2 = of order q, and an admissible
bilinear map e : G1×G1 → G2. Let g ∈ G2 be e(P, P ),
which is the generator of G2.
• Generate an ℓ-dimension secret vector SV = (d1,··· , dℓ),
where di is randomly selected from ZZ
∗
q .
• Generate the corresponding ℓ-dimension public vector
PV = SV · P = (U1,··· , Uℓ) = (d1P,··· , dℓP ).
