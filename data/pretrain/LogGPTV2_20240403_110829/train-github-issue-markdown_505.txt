    1. What is a short input program that triggers the error?
    package pkg
    type A interface{}
    type B interface{}
    func F(a A) {
            control := make(chan B)
            control <- a
    }
    2. What is the full compiler output?
    example.go:8: internal compiler error: syslook: can't find runtime.convE2E
    Please file a bug report including a short program that triggers the error.

    3. What version of the compiler are you using?  (Run it with the -V flag.)
    6g version release.r56 7666
    4. Notes?
    This clearly is an invalid program, but its error message needs some love.
