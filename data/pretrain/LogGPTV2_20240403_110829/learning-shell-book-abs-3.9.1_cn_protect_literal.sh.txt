#  Similarly, during further usage of the string variable, the ${Me}
#+ is part of the contents (result) and survives any operations
#  (Until explicitly told to evaluate the string).
#  Hint: See what happens when the hard quotes ($'\x27') are replaced
#+ with soft quotes ($'\x22') in the above procedures.
#  Interesting also is to remove the addition of any quoting.
