### Title: Breaking Firmware Trust from Pre-EFI: Exploiting Early Boot Phases

**Abstract:**

Vulnerabilities in System Management Mode (SMM) and UEFI applications/drivers (DXE) have garnered significant attention from security researchers. Over the past nine months, the Binarly efiXplorer team has disclosed 42 high-impact vulnerabilities related to SMM and DXE firmware components. However, newer platforms have introduced enhanced runtime mitigations in the UEFI firmware execution environment, including SMM, with Intel's new Hardware Shield technologies applied below the operating system.

The complexity of modern platform security features continues to grow each year. These security promises are built on multiple layers, each defining its own security boundaries. Unfortunately, these layers can introduce inconsistencies in mitigation technologies, creating opportunities for breaking general security guarantees and enabling successful attacks.

In this presentation, we will share our research on recent changes in UEFI firmware security runtime, using one of the latest Intel CPUs as an example. We will cover the evolution of firmware mitigations in SMM/DXE on x86-based CPUs and discuss new attack vectors targeting the Intel Platform Properties Assessment Module (PPAM), which is often used in conjunction with the Intel SMI Transfer Monitor (STM). These topics have not been previously discussed from an offensive security research perspective.

**Key Points:**
1. **Vulnerability Disclosures:** The Binarly efiXplorer team has identified and disclosed 42 high-impact vulnerabilities in SMM and DXE firmware components.
2. **Enhanced Mitigations:** Newer platforms, particularly those with Intel Hardware Shield, have significantly increased runtime mitigations in the UEFI firmware execution environment.
3. **Security Layer Complexity:** The growing complexity of platform security features, while promising, can introduce inconsistencies that create vulnerabilities.
4. **Research Focus:** Our presentation will explore the evolution of firmware mitigations in SMM/DXE and new attack vectors on Intel PPAM and STM.
5. **Novel Insights:** This presentation will provide unique insights into these vulnerabilities and attack vectors, which have not been publicly discussed from an offensive security perspective.

By understanding these evolving threats and mitigations, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to enhance the security of modern computing platforms.
