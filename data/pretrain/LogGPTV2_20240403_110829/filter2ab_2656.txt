**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Restrict File and Directory Permissions

To protect files stored locally, it is essential to set appropriate file and directory permissions. This practice limits the opportunities for adversaries to interact with and collect information from the local system. Proper permissions ensure that only authorized users and processes can access, modify, or delete sensitive data, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data exfiltration.
