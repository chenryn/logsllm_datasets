transform [24] with a non-tight security reduction in the ROM and
one based on the Unruh transform [43–45] with a non-tight reduc-
tion in the QROM. Signatures of Picnic with the Unruh transform
are about 4× larger than those obtained from the SPHINCS+ frame-
work for comparable security levels. Also, the “Picnic1” Fiat-Shamir
signatures are more than a factor 2 larger than the speed-optimized
instantiations of SPHINCS+ proposed to NIST (see below). The only
Picnic variant that offers signatures with sizes in a similar ballpark
as SPHINCS+ is the “Picnic2” instantiation. In Table 3 we compare
the NIST level-5 parameter set of Picnic2 with SPHINCS+ using pa-
rameters n = 256, h = 63, d = 9, b = 12, k = 29, w = 16 and simple
tweakable hash functions based on SHA-256. SPHINCS+ signatures
with those parameters are 28% smaller than the average Picnic2
signatures and 39% smaller than the worst-case Picnic2 signatures.
Signing of SPHINCS+ is more than 70% faster, key generation is
much slower, but verification is almost 50 times faster than for Pic-
nic2. This performance of SPHINCS+ is achieved with an instance
that has a tight QROM proof and conservative choice of underlying
symmetric primitive (SHA-256). The performance of Picnic2 on the
other hand heavily relies on version 3 of the rather aggressively
optimized symmetric encryption scheme LowMC, which was origi-
nally proposed in [2]. As far as we know, this latest version has not
been intensively studied; earlier versions were shown to not offer
the claimed security [20, 21, 41].

A SECURITY MODELS AND DEFINITIONS
In the following we discuss post-quantum security and the quantum-
accessible random oracle model (QROM). Afterwards we recall
the definitions of post-quantum existential unforgeability under
adaptive chosen-message attacks (pq-eu-cma) and post-quantum-
secure pseudorandom functions (pq-prf).
Post-quantum security and the QROM. In this work we are
concerned with the post-quantum security of the cryptographic
schemes presented. In this setting, we assume that all honest parties
use conventional hardware (often referred to as being ‘classical’).
Malicious parties, i.e., all adversaries, are generally assumed to have
access to a large-scale quantum computer (often referred to as be-
ing ‘quantum’). In consequence, all oracles that model an honest
user and take an input unknown to the adversary are restricted to
conventional queries. The only exception to this in a post-quantum
setting are oracles that represent idealized, unkeyed primitives like
random oracles (RO)2 that do not take any input unknown to the
adversary. These oracles model functions that in reality could be im-
plemented by any the adversary locally on its quantum computer as
