User: I have Python 3.6 and Windows 7. 
I am able to successfully start the python interpreter in interactive mode, which I have confirmed by going to cmd, and typing in python, so my computer knows how to find the interpreter.
I am confused however, as to how to access files from the interpreter. For example, I have a file called test.py (yes, I made sure the correct file extension was used). 
However, I do not know how to access test.py from the interpreter. Let us say for the sake of argument that the test.py file has been stored in C:\ How then would I access test.py from the interpreter?
Assistant: In command prompt you need to navigate to the file location. In your case it is in C:\ drive, so type:

cd C:\

and then proceed to run your program:

python test.py

or you could do it in one line:

python C:\test.py
