Proof. We know from Proposition C.3 that there are more than

upper bounded by the following expression:

Hence,
P( ˆBik)  i +1, and appropriately chosen constants C2, C3 > 0
as functions of the fixed δ. Finally, since P( ˆBik) decreases as k − i
grows and is smaller than 1 for all k > i + 1, we obtain the desired
inequality for a sufficiently small c ≤ C3.
We can now proceed with the main proof.
We divide the proof in to two steps. In the first step, we prove
for ε = 1/2. By Lemma A.1, we have

Combining (44), (50) and (42) concludes the proof of step 1.
In step two, we prove for any ε > 0 by recursively applying the
bootstrapping procedure in step 1. Assume the following statement
is true: for any θ ≥ m there exist constants ¯aθ , ¯Aθ so that for all

have from the memoryless property of the Poisson process that
