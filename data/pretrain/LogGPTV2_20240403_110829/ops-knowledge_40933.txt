User: Often when I am coding I just like to print little things (mostly the current value of variables) out to console. I don't see anything like this for Google App Engine, although I note that the Google App Engine Launcher does have a Log terminal. Is there any way to write to said Terminal, or to some other terminal, using Google App Engine?
Assistant: Hello I'm using the version 1.8.6 of GoogleAppEngineLauncher, you can use a flag to set the messages log level you want to see, for example for debug messages:
--dev_appserver_log_level debug
Use it instead of --debug (see @Christopher answer).
