**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Confucius

Confucius has been observed to maintain persistence on a compromised host by dropping malicious files into the startup folder located at `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.[64]

This method ensures that the malicious files are executed every time the system starts, thereby allowing the threat actor to maintain long-term access to the affected system.
