preﬁx and assume that each router on the path responds to
traceroute with the IP address of the incoming interface, we
can conclude that @IXP4 belongs to the preﬁx of this IXP;
that is, the trace must have gone through the IXP.
3.3 Identifying members and peerings
By mapping @AS1 and @AS4 to their AS numbers, we
obtain conclusive evidence that AS1 and AS4 are not only
members of this IXP, but in fact peer with one another at
this particular location. Unfortunately, there are a number
of potential problems with this basic method. First, knowl-
edge of the IXP preﬁxes precludes the discovery of IXPs that
use private ASNs, and we provide details about the number
of such IXPs in Sec. 6.1. Second, and more importantly, not
all routers respond to traceroute probes with the incoming
interface’s IP address but use instead an alternate IP ad-
dress, or do not respond at all. The alternate address might
not belong to the member, but to one of its neighbors. Also
the router could respond with a correct address, but the AS
mapping might fail at ﬁnding the correct AS number. This
could result in wrongly inferred peering arrangements, and
we want to minimize the impact that such misclassiﬁcations
can have. To map the second member (AS4), we rely not
only on @AS4 but also on @IXP4. Indeed, @IXP4 was as-
signed by the IXP to AS4 and we have two additional ways
to map IXP addresses to their corresponding members.
First, since the DNS names associated with each IXP ad-
dress often provide information about the member identity,
we can try and use the DNS name to derive the AS number

[4]. Second, a BGP table dump contains the IP addresses
of the BGP peers, along with their AS numbers. At IXPs,
routers use their IXP-assigned address to establish peering
sessions. As a result, all BGP tables collected at routers
located at IXPs contain these IXP-assigned addresses and
their corresponding AS number. The next section gives more
detail on how we extracted this data. We describe here how
we use BGP tables to improve the inference of IXP peerings.
To map each IXP address to its AS number, we use three
techniques, when available, where the ordering reﬂects the
conﬁdence (from high to low) we have in these techniques:
1. BGP dumps: By deﬁnition, the (IXP address to ASN)
mapping is accurate, and thus we use it whenever it is avail-
able. However, since not all the IXP addresses appear in
our BGP table dumps, we had to rely on subsequent, more
error-prone techniques.
2. Majority-selection process: This heuristic was origi-
nally used in [4], but has been shown to work well in earlier
studies [15, 25]. The idea of the majority-selection process is
that in the majority of cases, routers will respond to tracer-
oute probes with the incoming interface. If, in our traces, we
ﬁnd more than one IP address following @IXP4, we select
the one that appears most frequently. We then map this
address to its AS number and assign it to @IXP4.
3. DNS names: If the router after the IXP address never
responds to our probes (i.e., the traceroute shows a “*” after
the IXP address), we cannot use the majority-selection tech-
nique. However, we can still try and derive the member AS
number based on the DNS name associated with the IXP ad-
dress, assuming the DNS naming convention supports such
an inference. We exclude from our study 1.5% of the tracer-
outes because they show a “*” after the IXP address and
this DNS-based heuristic does not apply
Note that the three techniques just described cannot be
applied to map @AS1. As a result, the mapping of this part
of the IXP peering is less accurate. Later, in Section 6.3, we
describe a method for evaluating the conﬁdence in a discov-
ered peering.
3.4 Data sources
As is typical for distributed and decentralized systems
such as the AS-level ecosystem, there exists no central repos-
itory for IXP-speciﬁc data. Instead, network researchers and
operators have access to multiple sources of IXP-related data
of varying quality, and in this paper, we make extensive use
of the following sources. Table 1 summarizes these sources
and our use of them.
IXP databases: Two rich sources for IXP-speciﬁc data
are Packet Clearing House [23] and PeeringDB [26].
The information they provide includes IXP names, geographic
locations, IXP preﬁx(es) where available, list of members,
and links to the IXP websites. Both databases are “best
eﬀort” and rely on voluntary contributions. It is important
to note that PCH tends to never drop an exchange from
the list; instead, as soon as suﬃcient evidence exists (e.g.,
through direct contacts), exchanges are marked as “defunct”
or “down”. PeeringDB encourages IXP operators to main-
tain their own information in their directory.
IXP websites: Another rich source of IXP-speciﬁc infor-
mation is an IXP’s website. Since most IXPs have an eco-
nomic incentive to attract new members, a typical IXP web-
site provides detailed information about location and facili-
ties; basic architecture, fees, and services; list of AS members
and, if available, overall traﬃc statistics. Using PCH, Peer-
ingDB, and search engines, we collected URLs for over 200
IXPs and wrote one generic and 15 special-purpose parsers
to extract the AS membership information available on those
webpages.6 By checking the Last-Modiﬁed HTTP header
value of the corresponding webpages, we eliminated stale
information to increase the overall quality of this valuable
source of data.
Internet Routing Registries (IRR): Network oper-
ators are asked to use the IRR to share their BGP poli-
cies [28]. The import and export attributes may indicate
the IP address of the BGP peering routers. When those at-
tributes are provided, we search for addresses that belong
to known IXP preﬁxes, resulting in an IXP-related peer-
ing. For example, the following extract reveals a peering
between Linx Telecom (AS3327) and Google (AS15169) at
the Amsterdam IXP (AMS-IX, allocating addresses in the
range 195.69.144.0/23).
aut-num:
import:
AS3327
from AS15169 195.69.144.247 ..
As the information contained in the IRR is provided on a
voluntary basis, its quality is unknown, but its freshness can
be inferred by checking the date the entries were posted. De-
spite these limitations, we extracted the IRR-related peer-
ings and used them to check for inconsistencies in our in-
ferred IXP-speciﬁc peerings. We manually queried the IRR
entries to discover additional IXP preﬁxes and collected IXP
contacts.
DNS names: We resolved the DNS names for the IP
addresses in all the IXP preﬁxes and inferred their corre-
sponding members, when possible.
[4] used this technique
but did not evaluate its accuracy and completeness.
Looking glass (LG) servers: Many networks run pub-
lic looking glass servers capable of issuing commands such as
ping, traceroute, or show ip bgp summary. Based on [29] we
collected a list of 2,329 working traceroute-capable LGs lo-
cated in 66 countries and 406 ASes (column labeled “LG” in
Table 2). 7 Of those 2,329 traceroute capable LGs, 1.1K were
also capable of issuing the show ip bgp summary command.
6While IXPs typically list their members by ASN, 48 of them
only publish their names/logos with corresponding hyper-
links. We convert the website DNS name to an IP address
and then map the IP address to an AS number using the
Team Cymru mapping service [27].
7Note that [29] has links to many more LGs, including many
that are not maintained and thus not usable. By relying on
the database in [29] and checking with the whois database,
we were originally able the determine the country location
for all but 33 of our LGs. Subsequently, we could also de-
termine the country location of those 33 LGs. For 50% of
our LGs, we coud even infer the city location, typically by
extracting geographic information from the names of the LG
servers themselves.

Table 2: Coverage of our datasets.
BGP tables: Route Views [30] and RIPE RIS [31]
provide snapshots of BGP tables, and many of them are ob-
tained from route collectors located at major IXPs. We also
relied on the LG-based BGP data from the 1.1K LGs ca-
pable of issuing the show ip bgp summary command. This
command lists the BGP sessions established with the router
running the LG and indicates for each session the ASN and
IP address of the peering router. If the routers peer at an
IXP, then the IP address will be the one assigned by the
IXP operator to the member. The following is an example
extract of the command run on a BGP router operated by
RUNNet (AS3267):
Neighbor
193.232.244.232
AS
15169
It shows that Google (AS15169) has a peering session with
RUNNet at the Moscow Internet Exchange (MSK-IX, using
preﬁx 193.232.244.0/23). Like the traceroute-based method,
mining BGP tables reveals information on the existence of
and memberships and peerings at IXPs, without the inac-
curacies inherent in traceroute-based data. For instance, in
our example, the address 193.232.244.232 will appear consis-
tently in any traceroute to a machine in Google’s AS15169
that traverses the MSK-IX. Knowing from the BGP table
that this address is assigned to Google, we can directly map
it to its correct ASN, and do not need to rely on the mapping
of the next address in the path (which, for reasons discussed
in Sec. 3.3, will not be necessarily mapped to Google’s AS).
Using BGP table dumps can be very eﬃcient. While a sin-
gle query to a BGP LG can yield dozens, or even hundreds
of IXP-related peerings, a single traceroute yields at most a
single such peering. Note however that although BGP ta-
bles provide accurate lists of members and peerings, these
lists are in general not complete because we can only detect
those members which have a peering relationship with our
LGs.
Traceroute datasets: Many projects have generated
large sets of traceroute data that have not been mined for
IXP-speciﬁc information. For example, the Skitter/Scam-
per measurement project [32] used 26 monitors to run pair-
wise traceroute probes and made the measurements publicly
available. We downloaded and used a snapshot that was
captured on April, 27th 2009. Dimes [10] employs about
18,000 agents scattered around the world that perform co-
ordinated traceroute measurements. We downloaded and
used the latest resulting dataset available (Feb. 2009). We
also obtained access to a traceroute data collected as part
of a project at Northwestern University [33], but this
dataset ended up contributing no new IXP-speciﬁc informa-
tion. Similarly, the public data collected with the mrinfo
tool [34] in July 2009 revealed no new IXPs and discovered
only 200 new peerings at 12 IXPs. Finally, two recent and
promising techniques remain to be investigated: traceroutes
run from P2P users [17] and the Reverse traceroute tool [35].
Ping data: A positive response to pinging IP addresses in
a known IXP preﬁx indicates that the IXP exists and is alive
(i.e., responding to ping). On the other hand, a negative
response can either mean that the IXP blocks ICMP packets
or that the IXP preﬁx is not advertised in the global BGP
tables, and thus not routable. We successively ran pings
to each address in each IXP preﬁx until we got a positive
response.
Miscellaneous: We used search engines and personal
contacts to resolve inconsistencies in the available data and
evaluate the relevance of 3rd-party information.
4. MAPPING THE IXP SUBSTRATE
4.1 List of IXPs and IXP preﬁxes
We ﬁrst build our list of known IXPs using the PCH and
PeeringDB databases. While as of April 2009, PCH con-
tained 332 IXPs marked as active, PeeringDB listed only
253. Through the use of search engines and private commu-
nications with IXP operators, we discovered two additional
IXPs not listed in either database. Merging these sources
resulted in a list of 359 unique IXPs, each with its name
and geographic location.
As mentioned earlier, key to our mapping eﬀorts is an
accurate and complete list of IXP preﬁxes. While IXPs
with unknown preﬁxes remain necessarily invisible to our
traceroute-based mapping technique, a wrong IXP preﬁx
will lead to wrong inferences. As of April 2009, PCH and
PeeringDB had preﬁxes for 227 and 165 IXPs, respectively.
By combining the two, we obtained 362 preﬁxes for 247
IXPs. We then augmented this list with preﬁxes of IXPs
we obtained through ad-hoc methods (e.g., by checking for
published IP address blocks on IXP websites, we found the
family of Russian RIPN IXPs). After checking the validity
of these newly obtained preﬁxes and IXPs (e.g., remove du-
plicates, check against information in the whois database,
rely on naming convention whereby the IXP name gener-
ally appears either in the domain name of the host name8),
we merged the resulting list of preﬁxes and IXPs with the
combined PCH/PeeringDB list and obtained our ﬁnal list
containing 393 preﬁxes for 278 IXPs.
4.2 Targeted traceroute
Building on previous eﬀorts [4], the main feature of our
approach is to infer peerings between members of an IXP by
launching targeted traceroute probes. The main diﬀerence
between our approach an these earlier eﬀorts is the input
data and the algorithms we use.
4.2.1 Input data
One critical component of the input data is our list of 278
IXPs with a total of 393 known preﬁxes, together with
their geographic location and list of their members—the
most complete list ever used in an IXP study. A second key
component is our list of 2.3K traceroute-enabled look-
ing glass (LG) servers, together with their geographic lo-
cation and the ASN of the network they belong to. We built
our list of traceroute-capable LGs from the traceroute.org
database [29] and updated it with 486 additional LGs from
PeeringDB and 20 LGs found through search engines. Our
list is the most complete list of traceroute-enabled LGs ever
used for providing more visibility into the Internet’s IXP
8As an example, the AustinMAP has a preﬁx in PCH, but
the DNS names of the corresponding IP addresses all end
with “szixp.co.sz”, suggesting that this preﬁx is in fact used
by an IXP in Swaziland.
340substrate. The third important component is our inferred
AS map obtained by either merging BGP routing tables
from the RIPE RIS and RouteViews projects or by down-
loading the latest map provided by the Cyclops project[36]
and constantly updating it with the new peerings we dis-
covered and validated in our experiments that we ran to
ﬁne-tune our methodology (see below). A typical Cyclops-
based map contains about 110K AS links. Our augmented
map contains 10-20% more links, all of them newly discov-
ered IXP-related peering links, representing the most com-
plete AS map currently available.
4.2.2 Our algorithm
For an IXP with N members, our algorithm has to ex-
amine at most N ∗ (N − 1) potential peerings. To check a
particular peering, say, between IXP members AS A and AS
