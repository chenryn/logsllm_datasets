User: What is the difference between containers and virtual machines? Which one would you choose for different business scenarios?
Assistant: The main difference between containers and virtual machines is their different virtualization methods. Container virtualization is based on a shared operating system, packaging applications and their dependencies into one or more independent containers to run through isolation technology, and the applications running inside the container are isolated from other applications of the host operating system Come. Virtual machine virtualization simulates multiple independent virtual hardware environments on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own operating system and application instance, and the applications run independently of each other. According to different business scenarios, choosing containers or virtual machines has different advantages and disadvantages. Containers are faster to start and deploy, smaller resource footprint, better scalability and higher density. Virtual machines have higher isolation and security, and wider operating system and application support. If you need to deploy lightweight, highly scalable applications, containers are a better choice; if you need applications with stronger isolation and security, or require different operating systems to run independently of each other, virtual machines are a better choice. Good choice. At the same time, containers and virtual machines can also be used in combination to build a more flexible and scalable application environment.
