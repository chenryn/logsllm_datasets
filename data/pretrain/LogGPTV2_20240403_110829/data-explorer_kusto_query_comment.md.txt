# Add a comment in KQL
Indicates user-provided text. Comments can be inserted on a separate line, nested at the end, or within a KQL query or command. The comment text isn't evaluated.
## Syntax
`//` *comment*
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Remarks
Use the two slashes (//) to add comments. The following table lists the keyboard shortcuts that you can use to comment or uncomment text.
| Hot Key  | Description  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `Ctrl`+`K`+`C`  | Comment current line or selected lines.  |
| `Ctrl`+`K`+`U`  | Uncomment current line or selected lines.  |
## Example
This example returns a count of events in the New York state:
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
// Return the count of events in the New York state from the StormEvents table
StormEvents
| where State == "NEW YORK" // Filter the records where the State is "NEW YORK"
| count
```
