### Enhancing Security Against DNS Cache Poisoning Attacks

#### Network Countermeasures
To make a successful attack more difficult, network administrators can deploy several countermeasures:
- **Multiple Caches with Diverse DNS Software**: Deploying multiple DNS resolvers, each using different DNS software, can reduce the likelihood of information leakage.
- **ICMP Error Suppression**: Ensure that DNS resolvers do not send ICMP errors to prevent potential leaks.
- **Randomization of DNS Records**: Nameservers should randomize the order of records in their responses to complicate the attacker's task.

#### Preventing Queries
Server operators can configure systems to perform fewer (or no) DNS lookups, especially for email servers. This reduces the chance that an attacker can trigger a query and initiate a poisoning attack.

#### Blocking Fragmentation
Resolver operators can block fragmented responses in firewalls to mitigate FragDNS attacks. Some operators, like Google’s 8.8.8.8, filter small fragments, which can prevent the attack by limiting the size of the nameserver response needed to reach the filtering limit.

#### Randomizing DNS Responses
Randomizing nameserver responses complicates the FragDNS attack, as the attacker must predict the UDP checksum of the original nameserver’s response.

#### 0x20 Encoding
0x20 Encoding adds entropy to DNS queries, making it harder for attackers to match the response. For example, adding 0x20 Encoding to a domain with 16 alphanumeric characters adds 16 bits of entropy. However, this randomness is only in the question section of the DNS packet and does not prevent the FragDNS attack, as it will be in the first fragment along with the TXID.

#### Securing BGP
Full deployment of RPKI (together with BGPSec) would prevent the HijackDNS attack. However, due to several deployment barriers, most prefixes are not protected by RPKI, and most ASes do not enforce Route Origin Validation (ROV). For a detailed discussion on deployment issues, refer to [39].

### Applications and Recommendations

#### Separate Resolvers and Caches
Using one DNS resolver for multiple services and servers is common but can be exploited. We recommend using different DNS resolvers (each with a distinct cache) for each system.

#### Third-Party Authentication (TLS)
Third-party authentication, such as TLS, can mitigate attacks against DNS use-cases aimed at locating a server (e.g., federation and address lookup). However, even with such mechanisms, DNS poisoning can still subvert the security of DV during certificate issuance and enable DoS attacks.

#### Two-Factor Authentication
Two-factor authentication should be enabled by default to prevent attackers from accessing accounts even if they acquire login credentials.

#### Secure Fallback
Instead of allowing transactions when no information about authorization state can be gathered, a security mechanism could decide to disallow them. This approach, however, could lead to DoS attacks if DNS availability is compromised, preventing a resolver from looking up SPF records and thus blocking emails.

### Conclusions

We evaluated methodologies for launching practical DNS cache poisoning attacks and derived insights into their applicability, effectiveness, and stealth. Our work highlights the critical role of DNS in ensuring the security and stability of applications and clients. If DNS is vulnerable, weak off-path adversaries can downgrade the protection of security mechanisms like RPKI or DV. We provide recommendations for mitigations and developed a public tool at https://crosslayerattacks.sit.fraunhofer.de to help clients identify vulnerabilities in DNS platforms on their networks.
