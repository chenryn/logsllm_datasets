worth considering with respect to scalability:  
•  The citizens shall access the e-Government application 
with  the  applications  of  choice,  i.e.  the  Web  browser 
the  citizen  is  used  to.  This  shall  result  in  higher 
acceptance, as no specific software besides the security 
capsule, which e.g. comes with the smart-card shipped 
by the CSP, needs to be installed. 
•  The  applications  shall  be controlled centrally in order

to make enhancements or modifications manageable.  
A  further  aspect  is  that  the  transition  to  the  security 
architecture needs to be smoothly with respect to existing 
applications,  as 
into  an 
operational  and  in  many  cases  proprietary  environment 
can  turn  out  a  costly  experience,  if  at  all  possible. 
Concepts  on  how 
the  security  architecture  can  be

typical  e-Government  application, 
the  user 
accesses  the  application  via  the  Web.  The  first  step 
required is to secure the communication link. As different 
applications  have  different  security  requirements,  the 
strategy followed is to define three classes, as follows:  
I.  Normal  use:  This  class  employs  the  TLS  (HTTPS) 
capabilities  of  state-of-the-art  Web-browsers  and 
Web-servers.  The  security  capsule  is  not  employed, 
as  no 
is 
required.  The  class  is  usually  employed  just  for 
information retrieval such as form archives. 
identification  of  electronic  signatures 
II.  Trustworthy infrastructure: This class employs the 
security  capsule  for  identification  and  electronic 
signatures,  but  relies  on  the  HTTPS  implementation 
of the browser and the server. Thus, the Web-browser 
and  the  Web-server  is  assumed  the  trustworthy 
infrastructure.  
III.  Technical end-to-end security: The highest security 
level  is  given,  if  the  security  capsule  replaces  the 
session  certificate  establishment  of  the  browser.  The 
drawback  is  that  this  requires  changes  in  the  Web-
browser, such as additional plug ins.  
Re-using the workflow example we gave for tax forms 
in the introduction, we continue with discussing how this 
works with the security layer. We use this simple example, 
as  tax  declarations  are  limited  to  a  single  administrative 
domain  –  the  tax  office  –  and  usually  do  not  require 
successive communication steps back and forth. Thus, we 
avoid  discussing  delegations  and  we  avoid  considering 
file enclosures subsequently to entering the administrative 
process. We also neglect the case of Web-portals sketched 
in  figure  1,  as  these  anyhow  shall  not  enter  into  the 
security-relationship  between  the  citizen  and  the  public 
authority.  
that

component 
The  citizen  first  accesses  the  tax  office’s  Web server. 
We assume a security class II as listed above. The citizen 
then  needs  to  identify  himself.  In  a  process  termed 
‘automatic authentication’, we assume that at both ends – 
the  citizen’s  PC  and  the  tax  office’s  Web  server  –  a 
security layer is running. In addition, an active component 
(a  servlet)  has  been  implemented  at  the  Web  server.  For 
automatic authentication the citizen activates a link to the 
active 
the  VPK-based 
identification  process  discussed  in  section  3.2.  In  a 
handshake  process,  the  active  component  redirects  an 
HTTP request to the security layer asking for releasing the 
persona  binding,  which  the  citizen  needs  to  permit  (cf. 
info-box access in section 4). The ZMR is combined with 
the  identification  of  the  tax  declaration  ID  (cf.  figure  3) 
and the VPK is constructed and signed with a timestamp 
and  a  nonce  to  avoid  replays.  The  whole  procedure  is 
controlled by redirects implemented with the Web-server 
where  an  active  component  performed  the  necessary 
computations,  and 
the 
security  functions.  The  unique  VPK  can 
than  be 
transformed to a conventional authentication scheme, such 
as  a  username/password  scheme 
to  access  existing 
applications.  For  instance,  tax  consultants  already  access 
the  tax  offices  online  and  thus  smooth  transition  to 
existing applications is needed.  
the  security  capsule  ensures 
Once the citizen is identified, the Web-server offers a 
Web-form.  Smart  forms  can  be  employed,  e.g.  the  name 
and date of birth can be derived from the persona binding 
or  data  known

automatically.  These  forms  are,  once  filled  out  by  the

Figure 5: Application environment  
Basing  on 
the  concepts  described,  numerous  e-
Government  application  are  being  developed  and  in  the 
process of being launched. Already operational are filing 
applications to the social insurance system, or registration 
of a business in the city of Vienna, the latter not yet using 
electronic  signatures.  Petitions  to  the  federal  ministries 
that  do  not  have  form  requirements  will  be  launched  in 
fall 2002. Calls for penal record reports will be possible to 
be carried out electronically in fall 2002. Our sample case 
discussed  in  this  section  –  i.e.  admitting  access  to  tax 
offices online for all citizens – is to be launched beginning 
of 2003.  
The  selection  also  shows  that  the  approach  of  an 
concerted  e-Government  strategy  with  an  sweeping 
security architecture works out well: different federal and 
municipal  agencies  adopted  the  approach  and  thus  a 
coherent access is possible for the citizens.  
To  give  an  example  of  the  private-public-partnership, 
the  banking  sector  has  adopted  the  approach  and  will 
launch electronically signed acknowledgements of money 
orders  in  fall/winter  2002.  Thus,  the  citizen  can  pay 
process  fees  via  online  banking  and  can  instantaneously 
attach to the proceeding the signed payment conformation 
that has been received from the bank.  
Conclusions 
The  paper  has  discussed  the  security  architecture 
employed with Austrian e-Government initiatives. General 
requirements  of  e-Government  have  been  discussed  and 
the  legal  provisions  that  allow  for  carrying  out  public 
administrations online have been sketched.  
The  core  part  of  the  security  infrastructure  is  the  so-
called citizen card which is a flexible concept that allows 
for  technological  variants,  as  long  as  a  minimal  set  of 
general requirements is supported. These requirements are 
basically  the  capability  of  creating  electronic  signatures 
and to store additional data such as certificates. With the 
roll  out  of  the  health  security  card  to  each  citizen,  the 
personal  identity  card,  and  numerous  other  smart-cards 
that  support 
the  concept,  a 
large  scale  security 
infrastructure will be established.  
For  concerns  of  flexibility  and  forward-compatibility, 
an  approach of combining the security-relevant functions 
to  a  so-called  security  capsule  has  been  followed.  This 
security  capsule  is  accessed  by  means  of  an  open 
interface, the so-called security layer. With this approach 
of  an  interface  at  a  high  abstraction  level,  applications 
have a logical view to the citizen card. This shall allow for 
easy 
technologies

the  e-Government 
application to each upcoming technology.

The  paper  has  discussed  the  process  of  accessing 
applications  with  a  simple  example.  This  has  been 
complemented  by  an  outlook  to  the  actual  applications 
that are being developed.
