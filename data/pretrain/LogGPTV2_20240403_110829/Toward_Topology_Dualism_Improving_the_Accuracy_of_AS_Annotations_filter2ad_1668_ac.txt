(BGP) degree ASes, since customer
ASes tend to have smaller degrees
than their providers, and Customer
assigns a multi-AS router to the cus-
tomer AS, decreasing the number of multi-AS routers for ASes with larger BGP de-
grees. We found that the Neighbor heuristic favors higher (BGP) degree ASes, inﬂating
the number of multi-AS routers for higher degree ASes.

3.2 Toward Accurate AS-Traceroute
As a second application of the dual graph construct, we outline an approach to designing
a more accurate AS-traceroute tool, a problem ﬁrst studied by Mao et al. [23]. Mao et
al. concluded that an accurate router-level map of the Internet would help to resolve
anomalies seen in AS paths derived from traceroutes. Here, we investigate whether our
AS assignment heuristics can improve AS-traceroute accuracy, by resolving anomalies
such as missing AS hops, extra AS hops and AS loops. Identifying missing and extra
108

AS hops requires BGP feeds from the vantage points used for traceroute measurements,
which the Ark infrastructure does not yet have. However, we can identify traceroutes
that have AS loops, by performing an IP-to-AS mapping using BGP dumps collected
from Routeviews and RIPE. Mao et al.. [23] noted two possible explanations for false
loops in traceroute paths: the presence of Internet Exchange Point (IXP) infrastructure,
and sibling ASes. We investigated whether our router-to-AS assignment alone can help
to resolve these loops. In future work, we plan to incorporate IXP data collected by
Augustin et al.. [7] to identify false loops due to IXP infrastructure, and WHOIS data
to identify false loops due to sibling ASes.

By applying IP-to-AS mapping on
the sequence of interfaces seen in each
traceroute, we found that most Ark mon-
itors yielded fewer than 5% of inferred
AS paths that had loops. However, traces
from one particular monitor yielded 75%
of inferred AS paths with loops, which
we discovered was caused by a single in-
correctly mapped interface traversed by
most traces from that monitor. We re-
moved these traces for the remainder of
our analysis. We then assigned an AS
to each inferred router on the path using
the AS assignment heuristics from Sec-
tion 2.3. We replaced the loop segment in the traceroute AS path with an AS path
segment derived from the router assignment heuristic. We measured the fraction of
paths with traceroute loops resolved, i.e., removed, via this procedure. Figure 5 shows
the fraction of traces with AS path loops that we could resolve using each of the AS
assignment heuristics. We found that the Customer heuristic performed poorly. The
Neighbor heuristic, which was the most accurate stand-alone AS assignment heuris-
tic (Section 2.4) was able to resolve 62% of AS path loops. The combination Elec-
tion+Degree, which was the most accurate combination AS-assignment heuristic, was
able to resolve just over 61% of AS path loops.

4 Related Work
There has been signiﬁcant interest in studying structural properties of the Internet at the
router and AS-levels for over a decade [12]. Several measurement studies have since
highlighted the incompleteness of topologies inferred from publicly available routing
data [9,16,22,24,32]. Much work has gone toward capturing as much of the Inter-
net’s AS-level topology as possible, most notably Zhang et al. [32] and He et al. [16].
Several large-scale active measurement projects, including Ark [17], iplane [20], and
DIMES [27], use traceroutes from distributed vantage points to a large set of desti-
nations across the IPv4 Internet. The resulting datasets have been used to reconstruct
router and AS-level topologies, but merging the two views has received less attention.
A major challenge in deriving topologies from traceroute measurements is alias res-
olution, i.e., determining which interfaces belong to the same router. Tangmunarunkit et

al. [13] proposed Mercator, a tool that attempted alias resolution by observing response
packets sent from different interfaces than those probed. Spring et al. [29] used Ally to
detect when two candidate interfaces likely shared the IP ID counter. Follow up work
on alias resolution [8,15,28] used techniques such as IP ID counter velocities, DNS
hostname conventions, and bi-directional traceroutes. Keys [19] recently documented
CAIDA’s attempt to expand and combine these techniques into a uniﬁed system.
There has been relatively little work on assigning routers (inferred by the previ-
ous alias resolution techniques) to the ASes that own those routers. Tangmunarunkit
et al. [31] used a simple heuristic based on longest preﬁx matching to assign routers
(inferred using Mercator) to ASes. Due to a lack of ground truth data, they were not
able to validate their router-to-AS assignment heuristic. Tangmunarunkit et al. [30] was
the ﬁrst to study the properties of ASes in terms of the number of routers per AS.
They found that ASes show high variability in the number of routers, and the number
of routers per AS is highly correlated with BGP AS degree. Our work on improving
AS-traceroute is inspired by the work of Mao et al. [23], who studied the discrepancies
between traceroute-derived AS paths and BGP AS paths, and Hyun et al. [18], who
measured the presence of third-party addresses in traceroute paths.
5 Conclusions
We have presented an approach to merge router and AS-level views of the Internet,
creating a dual graph of the Internet. We proposed new heuristics for assigning routers
from traceroute-derived graphs to ASes. We validated the success rates of our heuris-
tics against ground truth data from a set of commercial ISPs and research networks. For
multi-AS routers, the most successful heuristic was a combination of Election (assign
the router to the AS with the largest number of interfaces) followed by Degree (assign
the router to the AS with the smallest degree), with a success rate of 80%. For 32%
of inferred single-AS routers, we either missed or mis-resolved some interface that be-
longed to the true owning AS, reducing our overall AS assignment accuracy to 71%.
We also showed how our AS assignment techniques could be used to quantify statisti-
cal properties of ASes, as well as to improve on current state-of-the-art AS-traceroute
techniques, resolving up to 62% of false loops observed in traceroute-derived AS paths.
