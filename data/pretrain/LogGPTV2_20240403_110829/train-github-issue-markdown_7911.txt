I was looking for an easy/straightforward way to open observatory for my app.
`flutter --help` doesn't appear to give me an option to `flutter observe`.
Is there another way to open the observatory for my app? Or, should we made a
`flutter observe` ?
use case: I want to see the timeline of how my app starts up, and I am
assuming that a good way to do that is open the Observatory.
Workaround: `flutter run && open http://localhost:8181`
