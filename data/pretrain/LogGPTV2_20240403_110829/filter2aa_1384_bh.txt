#### B.2.2 Saving a tmux Session

To create a new window within a tmux session, press `Ctrl-b` followed by `c`. You can then rename the window as needed.

If you need to temporarily leave a tmux session, instead of closing the terminal, use the `tmux detach` command, which is `Ctrl-b d`. You should see an output similar to the following:
```
[detached (from session0)]
```
You will be returned to a regular bash prompt, and you can safely close the terminal.

When you return, open a new terminal and type `tmux ls` to list all active tmux sessions. The output will show the number of windows in each session, the session ID, and the date and time it was created. For example:
```
0: 2 windows (created Thu Apr 18 10:03:27 2019) [105x12]
```
This output also provides the character array or size of the session, such as `105x22` in this case.

To reattach to a specific tmux session, use the command `tmux a -t <session_id>`, where `<session_id>` is the numeric ID of the session. For instance, to attach to session 0, you would type:
```
tmux a -t 0
```
If `tmux ls` shows multiple sessions, replace `0` with the ID of the session you want to attach to.

Finally, tmux's ability to allow multiple users to attach to the same session simultaneously can be extremely useful, especially when collaborating on a penetration test with multiple consultants. This feature allows you and your team to work on the same session from different terminals, sharing the same environment and attacking the same target.

### Appendix C: Creating the Capsulecorp Pentest Lab Network

This appendix provides a high-level guide to setting up a testing environment that closely mirrors the Capsulecorp Pentest lab used in this book. It is not a step-by-step tutorial but rather a guide to help you understand the key components and configurations needed.

#### C.1 Hardware and Software Requirements

The Capsulecorp Pentest virtual lab network was built using a single physical server running VMware ESXi. The network consists of 11 hosts, including 6 Windows servers, 3 Windows workstations, and 2 Linux servers. The hardware specifications are as follows:

- **Server**: Intel NUC6i7KYK
- **Processor**: Quad-core i7-6770HQ
- **Memory**: 32 GB DDR4
- **Storage**: 1 TB SSD
- **Hypervisor**: VMware ESXi 6.7.0

#### C.2 Creating the Primary Windows Servers

##### C.2.1 Goku.capsulecorp.local

Goku is the domain controller for the Capsulecorp network. Follow the standard Microsoft documentation to promote this machine to a domain controller. Use the domain name `capsulecorp.local` and the NetBIOS domain name `CAPSULECORP`.

All other virtual hosts in the Capsulecorp network should be joined to the `CAPSULECORP` Active Directory domain. For Windows systems, follow the official Microsoft documentation. For Linux systems, follow the Ubuntu documentation using SSSD.

| Tien         | CAPSULECORP      | n/a             |

##### C.2.2 Gohan.capsulecorp.local

Gohan is running Microsoft SQL Server 2014. Download the setup files from the Microsoft download center and set up MSSQL Server with a weak password on the `sa` user account. In the example, the password for the `sa` account is `Password1`.

**Resources:**

- MSSQL 2014 setup guide: [TechNet Wiki](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/23878.sql-server-2014-step-by-step-installation.aspx)

##### C.2.3 Vegeta.capsulecorp.local

Vegeta is running a vulnerable instance of Jenkins. Download the Windows version of the latest Jenkins setup package and follow the installation instructions. Set up the username as `admin` and the password as `password`. The Windows IIS service is installed but not running, serving only as a demonstration for service discovery.

**Resources:**
- Jenkins download page: [Jenkins.io](https://jenkins.io/download)
- Jenkins setup page: [Jenkins.io Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing)

##### C.2.4 Trunks.capsulecorp.local

Trunks is running a vulnerable configuration of Apache Tomcat. The XAMPP project was used to set up Apache. Download the latest version of XAMPP for Windows and follow the setup documentation. Configure the Apache Tomcat server with a weak set of credentials, such as `admin/admin`.

**Resources:**

- XAMPP Windows FAQ: [Apache Friends](http://www.apachefriends.org/faq_windows.html)
- XAMPP Windows setup video: [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUe1iqPH4iM)

##### C.2.5 Nappa.capsulecorp.local and tien.capsulecorp.local

Nappa and Tien do not require any additional setup. By default, they are missing the MS17-010 patch and are vulnerable to the Eternal Blue exploit, as demonstrated in Chapter 8. These systems are often exploited in real-world pentests, leading to a domain admin-level compromise, as discussed in Chapter 11.

##### C.2.6 Yamcha.capsulecorp.local and Krillin.capsulecorp.local

These two systems are running Windows 10 Professional and do not have any vulnerable configurations apart from being joined to the `CAPSULECORP` domain. They are included to mirror real-world enterprise networks with user workstations.

#### C.3 Creating the Linux Servers

There are two Linux servers, both running Ubuntu 18.04 and joined to the `CAPSULECORP` domain. These servers are used to demonstrate Linux post-exploitation.

- **Piccolo.capsulecorp.local**: Running a vulnerable web application on port 80. The web application runs without root privileges. A configuration file in the web directory contains MySQL credentials for accessing `nail.capsulecorp.local`.
- **Nail.capsulecorp.local**: Running MySQL with root privileges.

This configuration demonstrates a common scenario where one system can be compromised without root privileges, leading to access to another system with elevated privileges.
