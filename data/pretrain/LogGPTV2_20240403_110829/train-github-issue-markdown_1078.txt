When upgrading my application from version alpha34 to alpha35, I encountered an issue with a directive that uses the selector `[on-init]`. This directive, which was functioning correctly in alpha34, no longer works in alpha35. 

I suspect that this problem is due to a conflict with the parser, specifically regarding the canonical syntax for events. The error message provided is not very clear:

```
TypeError: Cannot set property 'lastInBinding' of undefined
    at Function._ConvertAstIntoProtoRecords.create (http://me:8080/jspm_packages/npm/PI:EMAIL/src/change_detection/proto_change_detector.js:97:39)
    at http://me:8080/jspm_packages/npm/PI:EMAIL/src/change_detection/proto_change_detector.js:35:47
```

To improve the developer experience, it would be helpful if the error message could provide more specific information about the cause of the issue. Additionally, the documentation should include a warning advising against the use of certain prefixes (such as `on`, `var`, and `bind`) in attribute selectors, as they may lead to conflicts.
