Upgrading my app from alpha34 to alpha35, one directive I had with a selector
`[on-init]` was not working anymore. I realize it must be conflicting in the
parser with the canonical syntax for events, but it was working until alpha35
and the error we have now is not really explicit:
    TypeError: Cannot set property 'lastInBinding' of undefined
    at Function._ConvertAstIntoProtoRecords.create (http://me:8080/jspm_packages/npm/PI:EMAIL/src/change_detection/proto_change_detector.js:97:39)
    at http://me:8080/jspm_packages/npm/PI:EMAIL/src/change_detection/proto_change_detector.js:35:47
Maybe the error could be more explicit and the doc warns about not using these
prefixes (`on`, `var`, `bind`) in attribute selectors?
