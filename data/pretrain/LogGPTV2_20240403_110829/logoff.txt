**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `logoff` command is used to log a user out of a session on a Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH) server and delete the session.

**Syntax:**
```shell
logoff [SessionName | SessionID] [/server:<ServerName>] [/v] [/?]
```

**Parameters:**

- **SessionName**: Specifies the name of the active session.
- **SessionID**: Specifies the numeric ID that identifies the session to the server.
- **/server:<ServerName>**: Specifies the RDSH server that contains the session. If this parameter is not provided, the command will use the server on which you are currently active.
- **/v**: Displays information about the actions being performed.
- **/?**: Displays help at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**

- You can always log off from your own session.
- To log off users from other sessions, you must have Full Control permission.
- Logging off a user without warning can result in data loss. It is recommended to send a message to the user using the `msg` command before logging them off.
- If neither `SessionName` nor `SessionID` is specified, the `logoff` command will log off the user from the current session.
- After logging off a user, all processes in the session will be terminated, and the session will be deleted from the server.
- You cannot log off a user from the console session.

**Examples:**

1. **Log off a user from the current session:**
   ```shell
   logoff
   ```

2. **Log off a user from a session by using the session's ID (e.g., session 12):**
   ```shell
   logoff 12
   ```

3. **Log off a user from a session by using the name of the session and server (e.g., session TERM04 on Server1):**
   ```shell
   logoff TERM04 /server:Server1
   ```
