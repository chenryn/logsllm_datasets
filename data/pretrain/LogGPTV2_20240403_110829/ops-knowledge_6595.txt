User: I'm working on a site, colorurl.com, and I need users to be able to type in colorurl.com/00ff00 (or some variation of that), and see the correct page. However, with the naked domain issue, users who type in colorurl.com/somepath will instead be redirected to www.colorurl.com/.
Is there a way to detect this in python, and then redirect the user to where they meant to go (With the www. added?)
EDIT:
Clarification: In my webhost's configuration I have colorurl.com forward to www.colorurl.com. They do not support keeping the path (1and1). I have to detect the previous path and redirect users to it.

User goes to colorurl.com/path
User is redirected to www.colorurl.com
App needs to detect what the path was.
App sends user to www.colorurl.com/path
Assistant: You need to use a third-party site to do the redirection to www.*; many registrars offer this service.  Godaddy's service (which is even free with domain registration) forwards foo.com/bar to www.foo.com/bar; I can't speak to the capabilities of the others but it seems to me that any one that doesn't behave this way is broken.
