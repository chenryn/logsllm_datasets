User: I wrote a python script and have been running it in terminal on Mac OS X snow leopard using python2.6. I used raw_input() to import text in several places, but I seem to reach a limit where it will no longer accept any more characters.
Is this a limit in python raw_input() or is this something to do with Terminal or Mac OSX?
Is there a better way to have the user input larger amounts of text in python?
Assistant: I had this same experience, and found python limits the length of input to raw_input if you do not import the readline module. Once I imported the readline module, it lifted the limit (or at least raised it significantly enough to where the text I was using worked just fine).
