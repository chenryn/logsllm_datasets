### Title: Hidden macOS Vulnerabilities in Plain Sight

When we publish details and writeups about vulnerabilities, our focus is often so intensely on the specific bug at hand that we may overlook other potential issues. This can also occur when reading about these vulnerabilities. However, with a keen eye, we can uncover hidden gems.

In this talk, I will discuss three macOS vulnerabilities that I discovered while reading writeups of other vulnerabilities. Some of these vulnerabilities had been public for over four years, and I only noticed them after multiple readings. Once identified, it became clear that they were right there in front of us all along.

1. **2017 Pwn2Own macOS Exploit Chain:**
   - The original exploit chain involved a privilege escalation vulnerability in the disk arbitration service.
   - Upon further inspection, I found that the same logic flaw was present in an adjacent part of the code, allowing an attacker to perform a full sandbox escape.

2. **2020 Pwn2Own macOS Exploit Chain:**
   - The 2020 exploit chain included a vulnerability in the preferences daemon.
   - After carefully reviewing the patch provided by the authors for the twentieth time, I identified a new privilege escalation possibility.

3. **2021 XCSSET Malware TCC Bypass:**
   - In 2021, the XCSSET malware exploited a TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) 0day bypass, which was subsequently patched.
   - Mickey Jin later discovered a bypass for the patch and presented a new TCC bypass.
   - During my repeated analysis of Jin's work, I realized that not only could the new patch be bypassed, but there was a fundamental issue with the TCC framework itself, allowing for a generic bypass.

By keeping an open and observant mind, we can uncover significant security flaws that might otherwise remain hidden, even in well-documented vulnerabilities.
