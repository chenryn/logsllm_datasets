User:  Analyze the possible failure causes of the following phenomena, and give solutions When using the database, data cannot be accessed, changed or written
Assistant: Possible failure reasons: 1. Database files are damaged or accidentally deleted, such as table space, data files, log files, etc. 2. Data abnormality caused by hardware failure or software error, such as disk failure, memory failure, power failure, operating system error, etc. 3. Database application setting error, configuration problem or version incompatibility, etc. 4. Database connection timeout, deadlock or transaction blocking, etc. 5. Insufficient user rights or triggering access restriction rules, etc. Solution: 1. If the fault is caused by the damage of the database file, you can try to use the backup data to restore or use the database recovery technology to repair the damaged file. 2. Check the status of the hardware components and whether the related software (operating system or driver) is working normally. If necessary, the equipment can be maintained, corrected or replaced, and the database system can be restarted and reconnected at the same time. 3. Check the settings, configuration and version of the database application to ensure that it meets the requirements, and if necessary, upgrade or modify the relevant configuration. 4. Analyze the performance problems related to database connection and optimize the processing of query statements or expand the connection pool by increasing database server resources or adjusting time intervals. Also, properly use transactions and implement concurrency control algorithms to avoid deadlocks when locking tables and rows. 5. Make sure that the user rights are sufficient or adjust the database access policy appropriately to solve the access problem. The best way to reduce the incidence of failures is to regularly back up your database and perform recovery tests.
