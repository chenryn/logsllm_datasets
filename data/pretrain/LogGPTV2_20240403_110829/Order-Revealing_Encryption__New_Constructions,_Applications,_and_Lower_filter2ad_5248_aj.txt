simulated properly in H4. Suppose the adversary queries the oracle on an input (k, r). Before the
adversary makes a single encryption query, the outputs to the adversary’s random oracle query are
always a uniformly random draw from Z3 in both H3 and H4, which completes the base case.
For the inductive step, suppose that the two conditions hold for some t  s, then mα and mi agree on a preﬁx of length at least s. In
z(i)
s,τk(cid:48) (mi,s) = H(k, r),
where mi,s and k(cid:48) are deﬁned identically to the previous case. By the same argument as
in the previous case, we have that the distributions of the output H(k, r) in hybrids H3
and H4 are statistically indistinguishable.

• Otherwise, if k (cid:54)= k(α)
for all s ∈ [n] and α ∈ [t] or r (cid:54)= ri for all i ≤ t, then H(k, r) is
independent of all the ciphertexts ct1, . . . , ctt given out so far in H3. In this case, the output
of the random oracle is uniform and independent over Z3. By construction of the simulator,
the same holds in H4. In this case then, the outputs of the random oracle in H3 and H4 are
identically distributed.
Next, we show that the conditional distributions of ct(t+1)
given the adversary’s view in
H3 and H4, respectively, are statistically indistinguishable. Let mt+1 be the adversary’s (t + 1)th
encryption query. Since the components u(t+1)
in the left cipher-
texts are constructed independently in H3 and H4, respectively, we reason about each component
individually. For each s ∈ [n], we consider the three possibilities highlighted in the simulation:

By construction of ORE.EncryptL, the component u(t+1)
of the left ciphertext is a function of
only the ﬁrst t + 1 blocks of the message mt+1. Thus, if there is a message mj for which the
ﬁrst t + 1 blocks of mj and mt+1 are identical, then correspondingly, u(t+1)
s . In hybrid
H4, the simulator sets ¯u(t+1)
s , and so the claim follows from the inductive hypothesis.

In hybrid H3, h(t+1)

is derived from the
same permutation used to construct h(j)
s . In the simulation, the simulator samples a random
index from the set Sj,s, which is used to lazily sample the permutation τk. This is precisely
how the simulator lazily samples the permutation π in the proof of Theorem 3.3. In hybrid H3,
the key k(t+1)
is computed as the output of f1 on the preﬁx concatenated with the permuted
index. By construction, this is the ﬁrst time f1 is evaluated on this input (otherwise, we would
be in Case 1), and so the output of f1 is uniformly and independently distributed. This is

We conclude from the above case analysis that the conditional distribution of the left ciphertexts in
hybrids H3 and H4 is statistically indistinguishable.
R
To conclude the proof, we argue that the right ciphertext components are statistically indistin-
guishable in H3 and H4. Certainly rt+1 and ¯rt+1 are identically distributed. By construction, in
H3 and H4, the adversary must never have queried the random oracle on an input containing rt+1
and ¯rt+1 (otherwise, the experiment aborts with output ⊥2). But now, each component in ct(t+1)
and ct(t+1)
is blinded by the output the random oracle on an input containing rt+1 or ¯rt+1. Thus,
conditioned on the view of the adversary up to the point it issues its t + 1th encryption query, in
H3, the components of ct(t+1)
are perfectly hidden by the outputs of the random oracle, and thus,
appear independently and uniformly random over Z3. This is precisely the distribution from which
the simulator samples the elements of ct(t+1)
in H4. We conclude that the right ciphertexts are
properly distributed in H3 and H4. The lemma now follows by induction on t.
Combining Lemmas B.1 through B.4, we conclude that Πore is secure with leakage function Lblk.
