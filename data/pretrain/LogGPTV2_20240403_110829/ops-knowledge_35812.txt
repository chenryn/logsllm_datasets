User: So I have two tasks (let's say TaskA and TaskB).  I want both tasks to run hourly, but TaskB requires TaskA.  TaskB does not have any parameters, but TaskA has two parameters for the day and the hour.  If I run TaskB on the command line, would I need to pass it arguments?
Assistant: In general, you would not need to pass the parameters for Task A to Task B, but Task B would then need to generate the values of those parameters for Task A. If Task B can not generate those parameters, you would have to setup Task B to take those parameters in from the command line, and then pass them through to the Task A constructor in the requires method.
