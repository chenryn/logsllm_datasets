### Troubleshooting IBM MQ Issues

#### 1. Unexpected MQI Return Codes
- **Queue Shareability:**
  - Does your application assume that the queues it accesses are shareable? If a queue has been redefined as exclusive, can your application handle return codes indicating that it can no longer access that queue?
- **Queue Definitions and Security Profiles:**
  - Have any queue definitions or security profiles been changed? An `MQOPEN` call could fail due to a security violation. Can your application recover from the resulting return code?
- **Return Code Descriptions:**
  - Refer to the "MQI Applications Reference" for your programming language for detailed descriptions of each return code.

#### 2. PTF Installation
- **PTF Application:**
  - If you have applied any PTFs to IBM MQ for IBM i, ensure that you received no error messages during the installation.
- **Next Steps:**
  - If there were no errors, proceed to Step 4 on page 21.
  - If there were errors, review the preceding suggestions and then proceed to Step 4 on page 21.

#### 3. Server System Changes
- **Unchanged System:**
  - Has the server system remained unchanged since the last successful run?
  - If yes, proceed to "Identifying characteristics of the problem on IBM i" on page 22.
  - If no, consider all aspects of the system and review the appropriate documentation on how the change might have affected the IBM MQ application. For example:
    - Interfaces with other applications
    - Installation of new operating systems or hardware
    - Application of PTFs
    - Changes in operating procedures

### Related Tasks
- **Contacting IBM Support:**
  - If you need help with an IBM MQ issue, contact IBM Support through the IBM Support Site. You can also subscribe to notifications about IBM MQ fixes, troubleshooting, and other news.
- **Manually Applying Required Authority:**
  - Some IBM MQ commands and programs rely on using IBM i system commands and programs. Ensure that these commands and programs have the necessary authority. For example:
    - Use `GRTOBJAUT` with `OBJTYPE(*CMD)` to set authorities for commands.
    - Use `GRTOBJAUT` with `OBJTYPE(*PGM)` to set authorities for programs.
- **Determining Problems with Applications, Commands, and Messages:**
  - If you encounter problems with IBM MQ applications, commands, and messages, consider the following questions to identify the cause:
    - Are some of your queues working?
    - Does the problem affect only remote queues?
    - Are messages failing to arrive on the queue?
    - Do messages contain unexpected or corrupted information?
    - Are unexpected messages received when using distributed queues?

### Initial Checks by Platform
- **AIX:**
  - Before starting detailed problem determination on AIX, check for obvious causes or areas of investigation that are likely to give useful results.
- **Linux:**
  - Before starting detailed problem determination on Linux, check for obvious causes or areas of investigation that are likely to give useful results.
- **Windows:**
  - Before starting detailed problem determination on Windows, check for obvious causes or areas of investigation that are likely to give useful results.
- **z/OS:**
  - Before starting detailed problem determination on z/OS, check for obvious causes or areas of investigation that are likely to give useful results.

### Identifying Characteristics of the Problem on IBM i
- **Reproduce the Problem:**
  - Can you reproduce the problem? Consider the conditions under which the problem occurs.
- **Intermittent Problem:**
  - Is the problem intermittent? This might be due to processes running independently of each other.
- **Special Characters in Commands:**
  - Are you receiving errors when using special characters in commands? Ensure proper handling of special characters.
- **Network-Specific Issues:**
  - Does the problem affect specific parts of the network? Check for issues with remote queues and connections.
- **Time-Dependent Issues:**
  - Does the problem occur at specific times of the day? This might be related to system loading.
- **Command Response:**
  - Have you received no response from a command? Check the status of the command server and dead-letter queue.

### Procedure
1. **Reproducing the Problem:**
   - If you can reproduce the problem, consider the conditions under which it occurs.
   - Check if the problem is caused by a command or a program.
   - Identify any application that always seems to be running when the problem occurs.
   - Determine if the problem is specific to a particular queue manager or object.
2. **Intermittent Problem:**
   - Investigate potential issues with independent processes and in-doubt transactions.
3. **Special Characters:**
   - Properly handle special characters in commands to avoid errors.
4. **User-Specific Issues:**
   - Check if the problem affects all users or only some. Look for differences in system and queue manager settings.
5. **Network-Specific Issues:**
   - Identify specific parts of the network that are affected and check for connection and configuration issues.
6. **Version-Specific Issues:**
   - If the problem occurs only on a specific version of IBM MQ, check for relevant PTFs.
7. **Time-Dependent Issues:**
   - Check for system loading patterns and peak times.
8. **Command Response:**
   - Verify the status of the command server and check for dead-letter queue messages and error logs.
