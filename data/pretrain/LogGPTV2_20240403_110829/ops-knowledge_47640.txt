User: Please explain a three-tier network architecture and give an example.
Assistant: Three-Tier Architecture (Three-Tier Architecture) is a common software design pattern that divides applications into three main interrelated parts: user interface layer, business logic layer, and data storage layer. Each layer has specific functions and responsibilities. By defining the interface between each layer, the system can be more easily maintained, expanded and modified. For example, a three-tier architecture for an e-commerce website could look like this: 1. User Interface Layer: This layer provides users with an external view of the website. Users may interact with the Site using web pages, mobile applications, or other forms of interface. This layer includes functions such as user authentication, authorization, and session management. 2. Business logic layer: This layer controls the core functions and business logic of the website. It mainly handles user requests and converts these requests into calls for database operations and other background services. For example, when a user views a product on the website, the business logic layer will query the corresponding product information and display the information to the user. 3. Data storage layer: This layer is responsible for managing and storing data and interacting with the business logic layer. It can be a traditional relational database, a distributed database, an in-memory database, or other types of storage systems. In the above e-commerce website, the data storage layer will store all related data such as commodity information, user information and transaction records. In this way, when a user creates an order on an e-commerce website, he will send a request to the business logic layer through the user interface layer, and the business logic layer will call the data storage layer to complete the creation and storage of the order. Such a three-tier architecture realizes the separation of codes and improves code reusability and maintainability.
