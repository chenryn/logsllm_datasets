explain other statistical diﬀerences in the previously presented results for NPAT.
However, overall, we do not see signiﬁcant diﬀerences when comparing within a collection method and
authentication when comparing left vs. right angle. This is in conﬂict with prior work; however, recall that
the top observation angle was removed and the two near and far angles were reduced to a single side angle
(L or R). As the two comparable subsets are consistent, we can conﬁrm that under H4-p the live settings
are well predicted by a comparable subset of video data.
Passcode Properties (H1-r/H5-p)
In Table 8, again using single view data, a direct comparison between
each of the passcodes used in the study is displayed, with ﬁndings from proportionality tests between the live
and video setting. We ﬁnd that no signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist for the PAT and NPAT codes, and only three
of the PIN codes show diﬀerences. These include the following PINs: 5962, 159428, and 366792 with the live
setting attacker performance being signiﬁcantly better in each case. The spatial properties of these codes
(see Appendix B.2) does not suggest that a single factor played a role. Although both 5962 and 3669722 are
both right shifted PINs, there are too many other features at play to draw conclusions.
We can perform a within-collection method analysis across the passcodes using a χ2 test, and we ﬁnd
that signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist for the attacker success rate within both the live and video study, for all
authentication types. However, post-hoc analysis suggest that none of the NPAT pairwise comparisons are
signiﬁcant, and only one set of PAT pairwise comparisons are signiﬁcant (743521 vs. 3157) — 743521 was
the most diﬃcult of the patterns to shoulder surf. For PINs in post-hoc analysis, again 159428 and 366792
have signiﬁcant comparisons, particularly with PINs 7272 and 1955, which were two of the easiest PINs to
shoulder surf in comparison to 159428 and 366792, two of the most diﬃcult to shoulder surf.
Finally, we can compare the impacts of length. For PAT, we do not see signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
success rate for 4- vs. 6-length patterns (χ2 = 2.9, p = 0.09), but we do for the video study (χ2 = 12.83, p  1800 was included and the “top” angle
was excluded. A 2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction was used, and the χ2
statistic, p-value, and 95% conﬁdence interval (δ95) of the diﬀerence between the proportions (live - video)
are reported.

that of video setting. In essence, yes, the video study provides a baseline, but the baseline may be much
lower than one may expect, as much as 1.7x.
5.2 Post-Hoc Participant Feedback
One advantage of the live study is that the researchers can directly observe the strategies of the participants
and the relative diﬃculties encountered, as well as via post hoc questions (the precise questions are found
in the Appendix A.2). There is no direct comparison to the Aviv et al. prior work here, but we believe that
the strategies likely mirror those used by participants in the video study, to some extent.
The most commonly reported strategy for the observation task (n=16) was simply focusing on memorizing
the passcode as it appeared and then, after it was completely entered, writing it down immediately without
delay. Only three participants reported strategies involving writing or physically mirroring the input gesture
while it was happening. Other participants (n=2) described ”chunking” PINs into larger numbers (e.g.
”seventeen” versus ”one-seven”) in their ﬁrst languages (Farsi and Chinese) to make quick memorization
easier. Five participants mentioned that they watched the readout ﬁeld in the PIN conditions, while others
preferred to watch only the ﬁnger gesture as it was performed.
Participants mentioned several factors that could make PIN and grid passcodes challenging to accurately
record. These included grid pattern shapes that crossed over themselves or contained knightmoves (n=11,
e.g. 743521 and 4572, Figure 4), as well as both long physical jumps between sequential PIN digits (n=3)
and sequential digits physically close together (n=7). Ten participants reported that viewing from the right
was harder because their view of the phone screen was partially blocked by the victim-proctor’s thumb in
his right-handed grip, which is supported in the data, particularly for NPAT results. Six participants also
felt that glare from overhead lighting was sometimes an issue.
Other passcode features and conditions were described as helpful by observers. Four participants men-
tioned that it was easier to memorize shapes that they could easily associate with a visual image, such as
136785 as a house, or 842157 as a picnic table (Figure 4).
Finally, multiple observations of the same passcode were commonly deemed helpful for conﬁrming or
piecing together sequences, although one participant stated that it was easier to do this if both observations
were made from the same side. This is supported by the quantitative data.

Implications
Importance of evaluating in appropriate settings Researchers often favor performing studies ex-
amining observational attacks with video-based stimuli presented to participants. While likely simpler to
coordinate and easier to control compared to studies conducted in live settings, video studies can lack realism
15
and are considered a methodological substitute only when necessary [27]. While ﬁndings from video stud-
ies can be helpful to determine attack rate, our ﬁndings suggest that researchers evaluating authentication
interfaces should be aware that there is no substitute for testing in live settings, as the video baseline may
greatly underestimate the threat of an attacker. The video baseline may serve as a method for a preliminary
assessment.
Factors which should be taken into account when performing observational attack studies
While factors such as authentication type and repeated views can impact attack rate, as evidenced through
our study, other factors are worthy of further investigation. Examples include examination of the impact of
observational angle and spatial properties of passcodes and device screen sizes. While signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in some of these factors could not always be detected, subjective feedback gathered from participant observers
suggested that these factors could make a diﬀerence to attacker success. Examining these in more detail,
alongside gathering subjective data for purposes of identifying reasoning, is suggested to researchers, as these
may play a greater role than once thought.
Care in selection of passcode Our results suggest that speciﬁc types and properties of passcode may be
more susceptible to observational attack, as identiﬁed through the comparison with live settings. As a result,
users should be aware that removing the feedback lines from pattern unlock interfaces may not provide the
security beneﬁts that users expect. Secondly, PINs are more susceptible to attack than previously identiﬁed
by researchers performing video-based studies. This is also supported in our qualitative feedback where
participants noted that PINs with larger jumps were harder to attack, and for PAT/NPAT, those that are
less “shape like” (e.g. resembling a house-like shape) are harder for participants.
Need for training As our ﬁndings have highlighted that observational attacks are more successful under
speciﬁc conditions, security training for mobile device users can be developed to better understand the nature
of observational threats, encouraging them to make better security choices. Some users may need to better
understand what methods and parameters would provide resilience against high-probability multiple-view
observation attacks mounted by “insider threats” [28]. Others might want those authentication factors tilted
towards greater ease of use if they perceive less risk of observational attack. Better informing these choices
could come in the form of interactive guidance/prompting when setting-up devices.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have described a study comparing video recreations of shoulder surﬁng to live simulation.
We recreated a subset of the factors explored in the video study and attempted to conﬁrm prior ﬁndings in
this setting. We were able to conﬁrm many of the prior claims regarding the video study, that authentication
type, repeated viewings, observation angle, and passcode properties can aﬀect attacker performance. We
were also able to conﬁrm that video study does form a baseline for the live simulation; however, this
baseline may be much less than desired, as much as 1.9x diﬀerence. From these ﬁndings we suggest, for
researchers conducting shoulder surﬁng studies with video components, that data can form a baseline and
be representative, in many situations, of what would occur in a live simulation. However, when possible,
those results should be compared to a live simulation to get a fuller picture of the data and results.
