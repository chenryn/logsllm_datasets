schtasks run
Starts a scheduled task immediately. The run operation ignores the schedule, but uses the program file location, user account, and password saved in the task to run the task immediately. Running a task does not affect the task schedule and does not change the next run time scheduled for the task.
Syntax
schtasks /run /tn  [/s  [/u [\] [/p ]]]
Parameters
Parameter
Description
/tn 
Identifies the task to start. This parameter is required.
/s 
Specifies the name or IP address of a remote computer (with or without backslashes). The default is the local computer.
/u []
Runs this command with the permissions of the specified user account. By default, the command runs with the permissions of the current user of the local computer. The specified user account must be a member of the Administrators group on the remote computer. The /u and /p parameters are valid only when you use /s.
/p 
Specifies the password of the user account specified in the /u parameter. If you use the /u parameter without the /p parameter or the password argument, schtasks will prompt you for a password. The /u and /p parameters are valid only when you use /s.
/?
Displays help at the command prompt.
