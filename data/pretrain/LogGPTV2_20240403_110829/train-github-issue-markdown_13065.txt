Like the layouts and pieces in Rails, I want a method to reuse the code.
Currently the webview tag can only display a whole html page; hence I should
always write duplicated html header tags and so on. Sharing on the global
javascript objects among them directly (since they may in the same page it's
redundant to have another scheme handle the sharing problem) could also save a
lot of codes. Or is there any way to customize an html tag so that I can
implement what I need.
