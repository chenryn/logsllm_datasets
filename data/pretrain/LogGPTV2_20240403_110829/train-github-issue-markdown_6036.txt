# Steps to reproduce
Start PowerToys run with Austrian/German localization and try to use `,` as

# Expected behavior
Excepted that PowerToys Run gets the delimiter from the OS settings and allows

I'm using Windows in English but have set my Regional Format to `German
(Austria)`.
# Actual behavior
Nothing.
