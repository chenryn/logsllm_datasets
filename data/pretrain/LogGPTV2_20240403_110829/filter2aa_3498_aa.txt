Acting Federal Aviation Administrator  
This report presents the results of our audit of Web applications security and 
intrusion detection in air traffic control (ATC) systems.  This audit was requested 
by the Ranking Minority members of the House Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure and its Aviation Subcommittee.   
Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)–7 designates air traffic control 
systems as part of the Nation’s critical infrastructure due to the important role 
commercial aviation plays in fostering and sustaining the national economy and 
ensuring citizens’ safety and mobility.  Essentially, HSPD-7 requires the Secretary 
of Transportation to ensure that the ATC system is protected from both physical 
and cyber security threats to prevent disruptions in air travel and commerce.   
The need to protect ATC systems from cyber attacks requires enhanced attention 
because the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has increasingly turned 
toward the use of commercial software and Internet Protocol (IP)1-based 
technologies to modernize ATC systems.  While use of commercial IP products, 
such as Web applications,2 has enabled FAA to efficiently collect and disseminate 
information to facilitate ATC services, it inevitably poses a higher security risk to 
ATC systems than when they were developed primarily with proprietary software.  
1 Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications standard describing how data are sent from one computer to 
another over the Internet.   
2 A Web application is a software program running on a Web server that can be accessed by using a Web 
browser.  A Web server may host multiple Web applications.  For purposes of this report, we use “Web 
application” to refer to either a Web application or a Web server. 
2
Now, attackers can take advantage of software vulnerabilities in commercial IP 
products to exploit ATC systems, which is especially worrisome at a time when 
the Nation is facing increased threats from sophisticated nation-state-sponsored 
cyber attacks.   
Accordingly, the objectives of this performance audit were to determine whether 
(1) Web applications used in supporting ATC operations are properly secured to 
prevent unauthorized access to ATC systems, and (2) FAA’s network intrusion-
detection capability is effective in monitoring ATC cyber-security incidents. 
KPMG, LLP, of Washington, D.C., under contract to the Office of Inspector 
General (OIG), completed the audit work for the first objective.  This work 
included vulnerability assessment and penetration testing on selected Web 
applications used in supporting ATC operations.  We performed a quality control 
review of the audit work carried out by KPMG to ensure that it complied with 
generally accepted government auditing standards.  In our opinion, KPMG’s audit 
work complied with applicable standards.  We supplemented KPMG’s work by 
conducting an analysis of significant cyber incidents reported by FAA in recent 
years.  KPMG’s report detailing findings of vulnerabilities and penetration results 
was provided to FAA in November 2008 for corrective action.  This report 
summarizes both KPMG’s and our results.  
We performed audit work to address the second objective.  This work included 
analysis of FAA’s cyber intrusion-detection capability and interviews with key 
personnel.  We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted 
government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis 
for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.  We believe that 
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions 
based on our audit objectives.  Details of our scope and methodology are described 
in Exhibit A. 
RESULTS IN BRIEF 
Web applications used in supporting ATC systems operations are not properly 
secured to prevent attacks or unauthorized access.  In addition, FAA has not 
established adequate intrusion-detection capability to monitor and detect potential 
cyber security incidents at ATC facilities.

Web Applications Security 
We tested 70 Web applications, some of which are used to disseminate 
information to the public over the Internet, such as communications frequencies 
for pilots and controllers; others are used internally within FAA to support eight 
ATC systems.3  Our test identified a total of 763 high-risk, 504 medium-risk, and 
2,590 low-risk vulnerabilities,4 such as weak passwords and unprotected critical 
file folders. 
By exploiting these vulnerabilities, the public could gain unauthorized access to 
information stored on Web application computers.  Further, through these 
vulnerabilities, internal FAA users (employees, contractors, industry partners, etc.) 
could gain unauthorized access to ATC systems because the Web applications 
often act as front-end interfaces (providing front-door access) to ATC systems.  In 
addition, these vulnerabilities could allow attackers to compromise FAA user 
computers by injecting malicious code onto the computers.   During the audit, 
KPMG and OIG staff gained unauthorized access to information stored on Web 
application computers and an ATC system, and confirmed system vulnerability to 
malicious code attacks.  
 Unauthorized access was gained to information stored on Web application 
computers associated with the Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure 
system, Juneau Aviation Weather System, and the Albuquerque Air Traffic 
Control Tower;  
 Unauthorized access was gained to an ATC system used to monitor critical 
power supply at six en route centers; and  
 Vulnerability found on Web applications associated with the Traffic Flow 
Management Infrastructure system was confirmed, which could allow 
attackers to install malicious codes on FAA users’ computers. 
3 While Web technologies are used to support many ATC systems, this audit covered only the following 
eight systems:  FAA’s Air Route Traffic Control Center Critical Essential Power System Power 
Monitoring System (APMS), TECHNET, En Route Automation Modernization/En Route Information 
Display System (ERAM/ERIDS), Computer-Aided Engineering Graphics (CAEG), Automated Inventory 
Tracking System ver. 2 (AITSv2), Airport Surveillance Radar—Local Area Network (ASRLAN), Juneau 
Aviation Weather System (JAWS), and Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure (TFM-I). 
4 High-risk vulnerabilities may provide an attacker with immediate access into a computer system, such as 
allowing execution of remote commands.  Medium-risk and low-risk vulnerabilities may provide an 
attacker with useful information, such as error messages revealing system configuration, that they can 
then use to compromise a computer system.

This occurred because (1) Web applications were not adequately configured5 to 
prevent unauthorized access and (2) Web application software with known 
vulnerabilities was not corrected in a timely matter by installing readily available 
security software patches released to the public by software vendors. 
Intrusion-detection Capabilities 
To effectively monitor and detect potential cyber-security incidents on a network, 
intrusion-detection-system (IDS) sensors need to be installed at various critical 
network points.  There, sensors automatically generate security alerts when 
potential cyber attacks are detected so that further incident response can be made.  
FAA’s intrusion-detection capability is ineffective because of inadequate 
deployment of IDS sensors at the facility level and a lack of timely remediation of 
incidents detected.  Specifically,  
 ATC systems are located at hundreds of operational facilities such 
as en route centers, terminal radar approach control facilities, and airport 
control towers.  However, IDS sensors have been deployed to only 11 of 
these ATC facilities.  Further, none of the IDS sensors are installed to 
monitor ATC operational systems at these facilities, such as the IP-based 
network associated with the Host Computer System.  Instead, these sensors 
provide monitoring coverage only for mission-support systems, such as e-
mail systems.    
 During Fiscal Year (FY) 2008, more than 800 cyber incident alerts were 
issued to the Air Traffic Organization (ATO), which is responsible for ATC 
operations.  As of the end of FY 2008, over 150 incidents (17 percent) had 
not been remediated, including critical incidents in which hackers may have 
taken over control of ATO computers.   
Without fully deploying IDS monitoring capability at ATC facilities and timely 
remediation against cyber incidents, FAA cannot take effective action to stop or 
prevent these cyber attacks, thus increasing the risk of further attacks on ATC 
systems.   
In recent years, serious cyber attacks have occurred on FAA networks.  For 
example, in February 2009, hackers compromised an FAA public-facing Web 
application computer and used it as a conduit to gain unauthorized access to 
personally identifiable information (PII) on 48,000 current and former FAA 
employees.  In 2008 hackers took control of FAA’s critical network servers

(domain controllers) and gained the power to shut down the servers, which could 
cause serious disruption to FAA’s mission-support network.  In 2006 a viral 
attack, widely distributed on the Internet, spread to FAA’s ATC systems, forcing 
FAA to shut down a portion of its ATC systems in Alaska. 
In our opinion, unless effective action is taken quickly, it is likely to be a matter of 
when, not if, ATC systems encounter attacks that do serious harm to ATC 
operations.  As indicated by the former Director of National Intelligence, 
“Our information infrastructure . . . increasingly is 
being targeted for exploitation and potentially for 
disruption or destruction. . . .  Terrorist groups . . . 
have expressed the desire to use cyber means to target 
the United States. . . .  It is no longer sufficient for the 
U.S. Government to discover cyber intrusions in its 
networks, clean up the damage, and take legal or 
political steps to deter further intrusions.  We must 
take proactive measures to detect and prevent 
intrusions from whatever source, as they happen, and 
before they can do significant damage.”6 
We made a series of recommendations beginning on page 11 to help enhance 
security over Web applications used in supporting ATC operations and improve 
the effectiveness of FAA’s cyber-incident-monitoring and -response capabilities.  
FAA concurred with all of our recommendations, and recognized that constant 
vigilance and effective action are the keys to addressing cyber security in its ATC 
systems.   The response can be found in its entirety in Appendix A.  
FINDINGS 
Web Applications Used in Supporting ATC Systems Operations 
Are Not Properly Secured 
Web applications used in supporting ATC systems operations are not properly 
secured to prevent attacks or unauthorized access.  KPMG staff conducted two 
separate security tests—one originated from the Internet and the other from FAA 
Headquarters’ mission-support network.  Due to time and resource constraints, 
only 70 Web applications were tested.  Thirty-five of these Web applications are

used by FAA to disseminate information to the public over the Internet, such as 
communications frequencies for pilots and controllers; others are used internally 
within FAA to support the eight ATC systems.  The tests identified a total of 763 
high-risk, 504 medium-risk, and 2,590 low-risk vulnerabilities (see Table 1).

High-risk vulnerabilities may provide an attacker with immediate access into a 
computer system, such as allowing execution of remote commands.  Medium-risk 
and low-risk vulnerabilities may provide an attacker with useful information, such 
as error messages revealing system configuration, that they can then use to 
compromise a computer system.  The following are examples of risks to ATC 
systems as a result of Web application vulnerabilities: 
 Vulnerabilities allowed unauthorized access to information stored on Web 
application computers.  Vulnerabilities found in Web application computers 
associated with the Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure system, Juneau 
Aviation Weather System, and the Albuquerque Air Traffic Control Tower 
allowed KPMG and OIG staff to gain unauthorized access to data stored on 
these computers, including program source code and sensitive PII. 
 Vulnerable Web applications were used as conduits to gain unauthorized 
access to and potentially compromise ATC system operations.  Through 
vulnerable Web applications, KPMG staff gained unauthorized access to the 
Power Monitoring System at six en route centers—Anchorage, Boston, 
Denver, Oakland, Salt Lake City, and Seattle.  While this system is not used 
to separate aircraft, it provides the critical mission-support function of 
eliminating voltage dropouts and surges caused by sources outside ATC 
facilities.  The unauthorized access enabled KPMG staff to generate power 
condition reports, which could be used by attackers as intelligence 
information for planning attacks.  A similar incident actually occurred in

February 2009.  By using a vulnerable public-facing Web application 
computer as a conduit, hackers gained unauthorized access to 48,000 PII 
records stored in an FAA database.  
 Vulnerable Web applications could allow attackers to execute malicious 
codes on FAA users’ computers.  This vulnerability was found on Web 
applications associated with the Traffic Flow Management Infrastructure 
system.  Once infected via these applications, FAA user computers would 
take orders from hackers to attack other computers or send critical network 
information to hackers (“exfiltration”).7  A similar incident actually occurred 
in August 2008.  By executing malicious codes, hackers took control of 
FAA’s critical network servers (domain controllers) and gained the power to 
shut down the servers, which could have caused serious disruption to FAA’s 
mission-support network.   
So far most attacks have primarily disrupted FAA’s ATC mission-support 
function.  However, it is important to understand that attacks can spread from the
