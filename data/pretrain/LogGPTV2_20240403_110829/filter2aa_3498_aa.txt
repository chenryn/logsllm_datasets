This report presents the findings of our audit of web applications security and intrusion detection in air traffic control (ATC) systems. The audit was requested by the Ranking Minority members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and its Aviation Subcommittee.

**Background:**

Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-7 designates air traffic control systems as critical infrastructure due to their vital role in supporting the national economy and ensuring public safety and mobility. HSPD-7 mandates that the Secretary of Transportation ensure the protection of ATC systems from both physical and cyber threats to prevent disruptions in air travel and commerce.

The increasing use of commercial software and Internet Protocol (IP)-based technologies in modernizing ATC systems has heightened the need for enhanced cybersecurity. While these technologies have improved efficiency, they also introduce higher security risks compared to proprietary software. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in commercial IP products, which is particularly concerning given the rise in sophisticated nation-state-sponsored cyber attacks.

**Audit Objectives:**

1. Determine whether web applications used in ATC operations are properly secured to prevent unauthorized access.
2. Assess the effectiveness of FAA’s network intrusion-detection capability in monitoring ATC cybersecurity incidents.

**Audit Methodology:**

KPMG, LLP, under contract with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), conducted the audit for the first objective, including vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on selected web applications. We performed a quality control review of KPMG’s work to ensure compliance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Additionally, we analyzed significant cyber incidents reported by FAA in recent years.

For the second objective, we analyzed FAA’s intrusion-detection capability and interviewed key personnel. Our audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, providing a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.

**Results in Brief:**

- **Web Applications Security:**
  - 70 web applications were tested, some of which disseminate information to the public, while others support internal FAA operations.
  - A total of 763 high-risk, 504 medium-risk, and 2,590 low-risk vulnerabilities were identified, such as weak passwords and unprotected file folders.
  - Exploiting these vulnerabilities, unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive information and compromise ATC systems.
  - Unauthorized access was gained to information stored on web application computers and an ATC system, confirming the system's vulnerability to malicious code attacks.

- **Intrusion-Detection Capabilities:**
  - FAA’s intrusion-detection capability is ineffective due to inadequate deployment of sensors and untimely remediation of detected incidents.
  - IDS sensors are deployed at only 11 out of hundreds of ATC facilities, and none monitor operational systems.
  - Over 800 cyber incident alerts were issued in FY 2008, with over 150 (17%) remaining unremediated.

**Detailed Findings:**

**Web Applications Security:**

- **Security Testing:**
  - Two separate security tests were conducted: one from the internet and another from FAA’s mission-support network.
  - 35 web applications used for public information dissemination and 35 for internal FAA support were tested.
  - High-risk vulnerabilities provide immediate access to systems, while medium and low-risk vulnerabilities provide useful information for further exploitation.

- **Risks to ATC Systems:**
  - Unauthorized access to information stored on web application computers, including PII and program source code.
  - Use of vulnerable web applications as conduits to compromise ATC system operations.
  - Potential for executing malicious code on FAA user computers, leading to further attacks or data exfiltration.

**Intrusion-Detection Capabilities:**

- **Deployment and Monitoring:**
  - IDS sensors are not fully deployed at critical ATC facilities.
  - Untimely remediation of detected incidents increases the risk of further attacks.

- **Recent Cyber Attacks:**
  - In February 2009, hackers compromised a public-facing web application to access PII of 48,000 FAA employees.
  - In 2008, hackers took control of FAA’s domain controllers, gaining the power to shut down servers.
  - In 2006, a viral attack forced the shutdown of a portion of ATC systems in Alaska.

**Recommendations:**

We recommend the following actions to enhance security over web applications and improve FAA’s cybersecurity monitoring and response capabilities:

1. Implement robust configuration management to prevent unauthorized access.
2 - Regularly update and patch web application software to address known vulnerabilities.
3. Expand the deployment of IDS sensors to all critical ATC facilities.
4. Establish a more efficient incident response process to ensure timely remediation.

**Conclusion:**

Effective and proactive measures are essential to detect and prevent cyber intrusions before they cause significant damage to ATC operations. FAA concurred with all recommendations and recognized the importance of constant vigilance and effective action in addressing cybersecurity.

**Footnotes:**
1. Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications standard describing how data are sent from one computer to another over the Internet.
2. A web application is a software program running on a web server that can be accessed using a web browser. For this report, “web application” refers to either a web application or a web server.
3. Software configuration involves setting up a software system for specific uses, such as changing default passwords.
4. High-risk vulnerabilities may provide immediate access to a system, such as allowing remote command execution. Medium and low-risk vulnerabilities may provide useful information, such as error messages revealing system configuration.
5. Exfiltration refers to the unauthorized transfer of data from a computer system.
