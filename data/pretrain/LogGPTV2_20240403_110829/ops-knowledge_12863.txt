User: When expanding the cloud computing platform, how to determine the load balancing and automatic expansion strategy? Please describe in detail.
Assistant: When scaling a cloud computing platform, a load balancing and autoscaling strategy must be determined. The following is a detailed description: 1. Load balancing strategy: Load balancing is a technology that distributes traffic to multiple servers. When choosing a load balancing strategy, the following factors need to be considered: - Response time: When choosing a load balancing strategy, priority should be given to response time. By choosing the server with the shortest response time, you can maximize the user experience. - Load distribution: load balancing should ensure that the load of each server is equal, which can ensure the reliability and stability of the entire system. - Cost: When choosing a load balancing strategy, also consider cost. The cost of some load balancing algorithms is relatively high, which may affect the efficiency of the entire system. Common load balancing strategies include round robin, weighted round robin, minimum number of connections, IP hash, etc. The polling strategy is suitable for redundant servers, and each request starts from the previous server; weighted polling allocates requests according to server weights, and servers with high weights get more requests; the minimum number of connections strategy is allocated to the one with the least number of current connections On the server; the IP hash policy performs load balancing according to the hash value of the client IP address. 2. Automatic expansion strategy Automatic expansion is a technology for dynamically allocating resources. When determining an autoscaling strategy, consider the following: - Monitoring metrics: Customer usage patterns will change over time and as demand changes. For example, resource consumption may be higher at certain times than at other times. Identifying metrics that can be monitored, such as CPU utilization, bandwidth usage, memory utilization, etc., can help you understand resource load and determine when autoscaling is required. - Threshold: When determining when to start autoscaling, a threshold must be set. Generally, choosing 90% to 95% CPU utilization or network bandwidth utilization is a safe policy. Autoscaling kicks in automatically when resource utilization exceeds a threshold. - Expansion scale: During automatic expansion, load balancing will automatically schedule new resources to the server with the least load. In summary, there are many factors to consider when choosing a load balancing and autoscaling strategy, including resource requirements, availability, cost, and user demand. Often, better advice and guidance can be obtained by talking to a cloud service provider.
