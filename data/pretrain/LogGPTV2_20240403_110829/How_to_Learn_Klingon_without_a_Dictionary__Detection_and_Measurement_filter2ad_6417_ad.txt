of yu*in*pi*PI:EMAIL means “domain sales”), there
are emails seemingly to be registered using individual email
account (e.g., the email addresses under qq.com). It turns out
the malicious domains we captured may be only a tip of the
iceberg: we queried reversewhois.domaintools.com to get the
number of all domains registered under each top email address
760
and the aggregated number is more than 2 million. Finally,
we compared the email addresses to the ones extracted from
the spider-pool domains we have captured before (2,731). The
Venn diagram of the two sets is shown in Figure 11. This time,
we identiﬁed much more underground players through KDES,
which include Faking certiﬁcate, Faking Luxury and Drug.
C. Impact on search engines
Search volume. We are interested in which keywords are
more likely to be queried by the users. To this end, we asked
Baidu and obtained a snapshot of the search volume pertaining
to each keyword aggregated from August 27th, 2016 to October
10th, 2016. We matched the black keywords against the search
volume list and were able to ﬁnd many matches. We show the

top 10 keywords in Table VII. As usual, keywords about sex
and gambling received the most queries. Most of the queries
were quite speciﬁc about the names of software (No.1 and 3) 6,
web sites (No.4 and 5) and gambling games (No.2, 5-8 and
10).
Keywords in other search engines. Most of the data (e.g.,
search results) we obtained came from Baidu. One may wonder
whether the same phenomenon exists in other search engines,
like Google and Bing. We want to learn the answer as well but
due to the deployment constraints (we have no access to the
internal APIs of Google and Bing), verifying every keyword
will be very difﬁcult. Thus, we sampled 120 keywords (20
per each categories) and queried them with Google and Bing.
We checked all returned links of the ﬁrst page. It turns out
that Google and Bing were neither exempted from the issues
related to black keywords. Due to the space limit, we only
showed 12 keywords in Table VIII.
Search ads. The revenue brought by search ads usually takes
the lion’s share in the overall revenue of a search engine
company. As described in Appendix A and Section II, strict
screening is usually performed for each search ad submitted
to the advertising platform. However, the platform is not
bullet-proof. We show one example about Baidu search ads
in Figure 12. To assess the prevalence of this problem, we
queried all 1,522 core words on Baidu and found 259 (17%)
of them lead to search ads, which should be banned at the
very beginning. Table IX shows the number of such keywords
under each category.
6While these software can play any video, they are mostly welcome for
porn video in China.
Fig. 13: Search ads submitted by tmall.com.
One case which draws our attention is shown in Figure 13,
which displays a search ad selling one type of knives prohibited
in China. The ad came from tmall.com, the leading eCommerce
platform in China. Surprisingly, the ad does not link to any
particular merchant under tmall.com. It seems that tmall.com
just blindly bids Baidu’s keywords to attract as much trafﬁc as
it can. Such keywords should be avoided by both eCommerce
sites and search engines, but the real meanings are usually
obscure to even seasoned reviewers. As a countermeasure,
these affected parties could deploy our approach to sanitize
the search ads.
D. Other channels
We examined the popularity of black keywords disseminated
through search engines. We are also interested in whether the
same set of keywords is used in other channels. To this end, we
matched the black keywords with the pages under Tieba [29]
and Zhidao [30], two very popular social network sites in China
(like Reddit and Quora) operated by Baidu. Since we have no
API access to obtain designated pages from these sites directly,
we examined the pages indexed by Baidu listed in the ﬁrst 5
result pages. In total, we identiﬁed 243,859 and 208,869 pages
of Tieba and Zhidao separately. We listed the count of URLs
under different categories in Table X and Table XI.
While our prior work has demonstrated that popular sites
can be abused to promote spam messages through site free-
