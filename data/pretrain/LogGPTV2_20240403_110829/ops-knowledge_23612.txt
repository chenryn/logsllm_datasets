User: How to configure static routing on Linux system?
Assistant: 1. View the current routing table You can use the command "route" or "ip route show" to view the routing table of the current system. 2. Add a static route Use the command "route add" or "ip route add" to add a static route. For example, to add a route to the network segment 192.168.1.0/24, the following are two commands to add a route: route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 10.0.0.1 dev eth0 ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 10.0.0.1 dev eth0 Among them, 10.0.0.1 is the next-hop gateway address, and eth0 is the egress NIC. 3. Persistent static routes Static routes will become invalid after restarting, so you need to save the added static routes so that they can be loaded automatically after restarting. On CentOS/RHEL systems, routes can be added to the "/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/route-eth0" file, where eth0 is the egress NIC. On Ubuntu/Debian systems, routes can be added to the "/etc/network/interfaces" file. After adding the routes to the file, the network service can be restarted with the command "service network restart" or "systemctl restart networking".
