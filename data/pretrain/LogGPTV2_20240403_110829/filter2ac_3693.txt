**ATT&CK ID:** T1140  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information

Adversaries may employ obfuscated files or information to conceal the artifacts of an intrusion, thereby evading detection and analysis. To utilize this obfuscated data, they often need specific mechanisms to decode or deobfuscate it, depending on their intended use. These methods can include built-in functionality within the malware itself or the use of system utilities that are already present on the target machine.
