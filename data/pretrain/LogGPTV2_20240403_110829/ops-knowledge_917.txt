**User:**
I am new to Python and have installed numerous libraries, which has made it difficult for me to keep track of which ones I have installed. Could you please help me find a way to generate a list of all the libraries I have installed? I am currently using macOS 10.9.2.

**Assistant:**
To get a list of all the libraries you have installed, you can use the following methods:

1. **Using `pip`**:
   - Run the command `pip list` in your terminal. This will display a list of all the installed Python packages along with their versions.

2. **Using `yolk`**:
   - First, install `yolk` by running `pip install yolk`.
   - Then, run `yolk -l` in your terminal to get a detailed list of installed packages.

Both methods should provide you with the information you need. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
