We can also take this to the opposite extreme. In Figure 3.04 (left), I clicked on the ’’power button” in the upper­
right. This turned the entire left edge green in color, and allowed all scripts to load on cnn.com. This includes 
the dozens of intrusive scripts that could load advertisements on the page. You can also see that small plus signs 
confirm that scripts were allowed to run while die minus signs in Figure 3.03 state the opposite. For most users, 
this allowance would seem irresponsible. However, there is a specific reason that we want die ability to allow all 
scripts. If you are collecting evidence, especially in criminal cases, you may want to archive a page exactly as it 
was meant to be seen. When we block scripts, we are technically modifying the page (evidence). By intentionally 
allowing all scripts before the collection of the screen capture, we know that we are viewing the page in an 
unmodified format. This may be overkill for many investigators, but you should know your options.

Next, we will modify the second (middle) column, which will apply settings globally. By default, all options are 
grey in color, which is desired by most users. This indicates that the default block list is applicable, and only 
invasive scripts will be blocked everywhere. For demonstration, I clicked on the right (red) portion of the top 
cell in the second column. This turned the entire column red, and indicates that all scripts across all websites 
will be blocked. After I saved my changes, evety website will only load the most basic text content. This will 
prohibit much of our research.
Using this same page, let's modify the options. In Figure 3.03 (left), 1 have clicked on die far-right portion of 
the first cell in the third column. This turned the entire third column red in color. This action activated an option 
to refresh the page (arrows) and an option to save the change (padlock). Clicking the padlock and then refreshing 
the page presented me with the example in Figure 3.03 (right). Since I blocked evety script, the page would not 
fully execute. It could not load images, design scripts, or any JavaScript. This is not useful at all, so I disabled 
my actions by clicking on the left (grey) section of the top cell in the third column, which turned the entire 
column back to grey in color. Saving these changes and refreshing the page brought me back to the example in 
Figure 3.02.
from that specific option. Two plus signs indicate that between ten and 
single minus sign (-) indicates that between one and nine scripts were L. 
minus signs tell us that ten to one hundred scripts were blocked. In Figure 3.02, 
were allowed to run from cnn.com, and at least one script was 
default behavior and provides a balance of functionality and 
should be allowed and which should be blocked.

Loading a page such as a Twitter profile resulted in no usable content. By clicking on the uBlock Origin icon 
and clicking the left (grey) sections of specific cells within the third column, 1 enabled those scripts without 
allowing everything on the page. While you cannot see the colors in Figure 3.04 (right), you can see the difference 
in shading. In this example, the entire second column is red. This indicates that all scripts are blocked globally. 
The third column is mostly red, but the options for twitter.com and twimg.com are grey. Those scripts will be 
allowed, if approved by uBlock Origin's rules, only for that domain. If I load a blog that has scripts from Twitter, 
they would still be ignored.
Hopefully, you arc practicing these settings and learning how this program functions. It is an amazing option 
that has protected me many times. If you are doing things right, you have likely completely messed-up your 
settings and are now7 blocking things you w'ant while allowing things you do not. Don't worry, we can reverse all 
of our mistakes by first making the global (second column) settings back to grey (left section of top cell). Next, 
return to the dashboard settings of die add-on, and click on the "My Rules" tab. In the second column 
(Temporary Rules), select all of the text and press the delete key on your kevboard. Click the "Save" button in 
this same column and then the "Commit" button to apply these settings everywhere. This resets our extension 
and brings us back to default usage regardless of your modifications. This is important in the event you go too 
far with settings in the future. Removing and reinstalling the extension does not ahvays wipe this data out of 
your system.
The primary benefit of uBlock Origin over odier options is the simple ability to block malicious scripts without 
customization, while having an option to allow7 or block any or all scripts at our disposal. This is a rarity in these 
types of add-ons. Another benefit is the ability to bypass website restrictions, such as a news site blocking articles 
unless the visitor has a subscription service. Consider the following example with the Los Angeles Times. 
Visiting the page allows you to view7 three articles for free, but you must have a paid subscription in order to 
continue using die site. Figure 3.05 displays the results of my blocked access. If I click on the uBlock Origin 
menu while on this page, select the right (red) option on die right (third) column under the setting for "3rd patty7 
scripts", then the padlock icon, and reload the page, I see a different result. I am now7 allowed to see the article. 
An example of this is seen in Figure 3.06. This is because this website relics on a third-party script to identify 
whether a visitor is logged in to the sendee. This modification presents unlimited view's of articles without 
registration on this and thousands of other websites.
These are extreme examples. Let's bring this back to some sanity. The following is how7 I recommend using 
uBlock Origin. Install, enable advanced options, and proceed with your work. When you arrive at a website that 
is blocking something you want to see, open the menu and click on the left (grey) section of the top cell in the 
third column. That wall allow' everything to load on that page, and that page only. When you are about to navigate 
to a questionable site that may tty' to install malicious code on your machine, click on the right (red) section of 
the top cell in the second column. That will block all scripts on all pages. Conduct your research and reverse the 
change when you are finished. Remember to click the save button (padlock) after each change and refresh the 
page.
