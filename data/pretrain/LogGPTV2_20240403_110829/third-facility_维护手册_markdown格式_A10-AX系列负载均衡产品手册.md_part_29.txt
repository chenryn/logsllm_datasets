#### Field Descriptions
- **Total run time:** Time elapsed since the health monitoring process started.
- **Number of burst:** Number of times the system detected that a health check would leave the ACOS device as a traffic burst, and remedied the situation.
- **max scan jiffie, min scan jiffie, average scan jiffie:** Internal counters used by technical support for debugging purposes.
- **Opened socket:** Number of sockets opened.
- **Open socket failed:** Number of failed attempts to open a socket.
- **Close socket:** Number of sockets closed.
- **Send packet:** Number of health check packets sent to the target of the health monitor.
- **Send packet failed:** Number of sent health check packets that failed (indicating the target server or service failed its health check).
- **Receive packet:** Number of packets received from the target in reply to health checks.
- **Receive packet failed:** Number of failed receive attempts.
- **Retry times:** Number of times a health check was resent because the target did not reply.
- **Timeout:** Number of times a response was not received before the health check timed out.
- **Unexpected error:** Number of unexpected errors that occurred.
- **Conn Immediate Success, Socket closed before l7, Socket closed without fd notify:** Internal counters used by technical support for debugging purposes.
- **Configured health-check rate:** If auto-adjust is enabled, shows "Auto configured". If auto-adjust is disabled, shows the manually configured threshold.
- **Current health-check rate:** If auto-adjust is enabled, shows the total number of health monitors divided by the global health-check timeout: `total-monitors / global-timeout`. If auto-adjust is disabled, shows the manually configured threshold.
- **External health-check max rate:** The external health-check probe rate.
- **Total number:** Total number of health checks performed.
- **Status UP:** Number of health checks that resulted in status UP.
- **Status DOWN:** Number of health checks that resulted in status DOWN.
- **Status UNKN:** Number of health checks that resulted in status UNKN.
- **Status OTHER:** Number of health checks that resulted in status OTHER.
- **IP address:** IP address of the real server.
- **Port:** Protocol port on the server.
- **Health monitor:** Name of the health monitor. If the name is "default", the default health monitor settings for the protocol port type are being used. (See “health-check” in the Command Line Interface Reference for ADC for Layer 3 health checks or “port” in the Command Line Interface Reference for ADC for Layer 4-7 health checks.)
- **Status:** Indicates whether the service passed the most recent health check.
- **Cause (Up/Down):** Up and Down show internal codes for the reasons the health check reported the server or service to be up or down. (See “Up and Down Causes for the show health stat Command” on page 375.)
- **Retry:** Number of retries.
- **PIN:** 
  - Current number of retries – Displayed to the left of the slash (/). The number of times the most recent health check was retried before a response was received or the maximum number of retries was used.
  - Current successful up-retries – Displayed to the right of the slash (/). Number of successful health check replies received for the current health check. This field is applicable if the up-retry option is configured for the health check. (See “health monitor” on page 128.)
