**How to reproduce this issue:**
Apply `transform: scale(0.8)` style on a `` element, and then resize
the screen. The webview contents take up an area smaller than the expected
size based on the CSS transform. The issue also also occurs when a script
changes the style attribute of the webview or its ancestor elements.
**Example:**
For this example I used a webview with `style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"`,
but I've experimented with webviews with different style configurations and
the issue seems to occur regardless of how the page is set up.
