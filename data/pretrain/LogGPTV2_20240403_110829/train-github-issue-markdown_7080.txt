Hi,
I successfully converted my Keras H5 model that I use in Python into a pb and
pbtxt files in order to use the same model in C++ via OpenCV.
You can find below the sample code I used simply to make sure that I can load
the model correctly:
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    #include 
    using namespace cv;
    using namespace dnn;
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
        String modelConfiguration = "wine_plant_detector.pbtxt";
        String modelWeights = "wine_plant_detector.pb";
        Mat blob;
        Net net = readNetFromTensorflow(modelWeights, modelConfiguration);
        return 0;
    }
That gives me the following error in Visual Studio 2017:
    OpenCV(4.4.0) Error: Assertion failed (const_layers.insert(std::make_pair(name, li)).second) in 
    cv::dnn::dnn4_v20200609::`anonymous-namespace'::addConstNodes, file C:\build\master_winpack-build-win64- 
    vc15\opencv\modules\dnn\src\tensorflow\tf_importer.cpp, line 672
I have attached the model files so that you can test your end.
model_files.zip
What I do not understand is that if I only use load the weight file it can
load the model so the error seems to occur while trying to read the model
configuration file. Is it necessary to use that file that make inference?
Here is my setup:
  * OpenCV => 4.4
  * Operating System / Platform => Windows 64 Bit
  * Compiler => Visual Studio 2017
Thanks in advance.
