**Abstract:**
Spam-based advertising is a lucrative business that continues to thrive despite widespread antipathy and a multi-billion dollar anti-spam industry. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the full structure of this enterprise, leading most anti-spam interventions to focus on isolated aspects of the spam value chain, such as spam filtering or URL blacklisting. In this paper, we present a holistic analysis that quantifies the resources employed in the monetization of spam email, including naming, hosting, payment, and fulfillment. Our study is based on extensive measurements of three months of diverse spam data, broad crawling of naming and hosting infrastructures, and over 100 purchases from spam-advertised sites. We relate these resources to the organizations that administer them and use this data to characterize the relative prospects for defensive interventions at each link in the spam value chain. Notably, we provide the first strong evidence of payment bottlenecks, with 95% of spam-advertised pharmaceuticals, replicas, and software products being monetized through merchant services from just a few banks.

## I. Introduction

Email spam is often viewed as a nuisance, clogging our inboxes with billions of unwanted messages daily. However, for its perpetrators, it is a powerful marketing channel that taps into latent demand for various products and services. While much attention is focused on the problem of spam delivery, the email vector is only one part of a larger, multifaceted business enterprise. Each click on a spam-advertised link initiates a complex trajectory involving a range of technical and business components necessary to monetize the customer's visit. This includes securing botnet services, registering domains, provisioning name servers, acquiring hosting or proxy services, and managing payment processing, merchant bank accounts, customer service, and fulfillment.

While individual elements of the spam value chain have been studied in isolation (e.g., botnet dynamics, DNS fast-flux networks, and website hosting), the relationships between these components are less well understood. These relationships capture the structural dependencies and potential weaknesses within the spam ecosystem's business processes. Each distinct path through the chain—registrar, name server, hosting, affiliate program, payment processing, and fulfillment—reflects an "entrepreneurial activity" by which perpetrators mobilize capital investments and business relationships to create value. Currently, we lack insight into even the most basic characteristics of this activity. How many organizations are involved in the spam ecosystem? Which points in their value chains do they share, and which operate independently? How wide are the bottlenecks at each stage of the value chain?

To address these questions empirically and guide decisions about the most effective mechanisms for addressing the spam problem, we developed a methodology to characterize the end-to-end resource dependencies ("trajectories") behind individual spam campaigns. We used three months of real-time source data, including captive botnets, raw spam feeds, and feeds of spam-advertised URLs, to drive active probing of spam infrastructure elements (name servers, redirectors, hosting proxies). From this, we identified sites advertising popular classes of goods—pharmaceuticals, replica luxury goods, and counterfeit software—and their membership in specific affiliate programs. For a subset of these sites, we performed online purchases, providing additional data about merchant bank affiliation, customer service, and fulfillment. Using this data, we characterized the resource footprint at each step in the spam value chain, the extent of sharing between spam organizations, and the relative prospects for interrupting spam monetization at different stages of the process.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a qualitative overview of the spam ecosystem and a review of related research. Section III describes the data sources, measurement techniques, and post-processing methodology used in our study. Section IV presents our analysis of spam activities between August and October 2010, and the implications of these findings for the efficacy of different anti-spam interventions. Finally, we conclude in Section V.

## II. Background and Related Work

As an advertising medium, spam shares the underlying business model of all advertising. As long as the revenue generated by spam campaigns exceeds their costs, spam remains a profitable enterprise. This simple description belies the complexity of the modern spam business. A decade ago, spammers might have handled virtually all aspects of the business, including email distribution, site design, hosting, payment processing, fulfillment, and customer service. Today, the spam business involves a range of players and service providers. In this section, we review the broad elements of the spam value chain, how these components have adapted to adversarial pressure from the anti-spam community, and the prior research on applied e-crime economics that informs our study.

### A. How Modern Spam Works

The user experience of spam primarily revolves around the received emails, but these constitute just one part of a larger value chain. We classify the spam value chain into three distinct stages: advertising, click support, and realization. Our discussion reflects the modern understanding of the degree to which specialization and affiliate programs dominate the use of spam to sell products. We draw upon and expand the narrative of the "Behind Online Pharma" project, which documents the market structure for online illegal pharmaceuticals, and Samosseiko’s recent overview of affiliate programs.

#### Advertising

Advertising encompasses all activities focused on reaching potential customers and enticing them to click on a particular URL. While we focus on the email spam vector, the same business model applies to other advertising vectors, such as blog spam, Twitter spam, search engine optimization, and sponsored advertising. The delivery of email spam has evolved significantly in response to increasingly complex defensive countermeasures. Large-scale efforts to shut down open SMTP proxies and the introduction of well-distributed IP blacklisting of spam senders have pushed spammers to use more sophisticated delivery vehicles, including botnets, Webmail spam, and IP prefix hijacking. Moreover, the market for spam services has stratified over time; for example, botnet operators now commonly rent their services to spammers on a contract basis.

The advertising side of the spam ecosystem has seen the most study, likely because it directly affects users. A broad and ongoing literature examines filtering spam email based on various content features, network characteristics of spam senders, and evaluating blacklists. Despite this attention, spam continues to be delivered, so our paper focuses on the remaining two stages of the spam monetization pipeline.

#### Click Support

Once the advertisement is delivered, a spammer depends on some fraction of recipients to respond, usually by clicking on an embedded URL and directing their browser to a website of interest. In practice, a spammer must orchestrate many moving parts and maintain them against pressure from defenders.

##### Redirection Sites

Some spammers directly advertise a URL, where the recipient's browser resolves the domain and fetches the content. However, defensive measures, such as URL and domain blacklisting and site takedowns, have led to more elaborate steps. Many spammers now advertise URLs that, when visited, redirect to additional URLs. Redirection strategies fall into two categories: those using legitimate third-party DNS name resources (e.g., free hosting, URL shorteners, or compromised websites) and those managed by the spammers themselves (e.g., a throwaway domain redirecting to a more persistent domain).

##### Domains

At some point, a click trajectory will require domain name resources managed by the spammer or their accomplices. These names are obtained through the services of a domain registrar, who arranges for the root-level registry of the associated top-level domain (TLD) to hold NS records for the registered domain. Spammers may purchase domains directly from a registrar or through a domain reseller, a "domaineer," or directly from a spam affiliate program. Interventions at this layer of the spam value chain depend significantly on the responsiveness of individual registrars and the pressure brought to bear. For example, a recent industry study documented heavy concentration of spam-advertised pharmacies with domains registered through a particular set of registrars who appear indifferent to complaints.

##### Name Servers

Any registered domain must have supporting name server infrastructure. Spammers must provision this infrastructure either by hosting DNS name servers themselves or by contracting with a third party. Since such resources are vulnerable to takedown requests, a thriving market has arisen in so-called "bulletproof" hosting services that resist such requests in exchange for a premium.

##### Web Servers

The address records provided by the spammer's name servers must specify servers that host or proxy website content. As with name servers, spam-advertised web servers can make use of bulletproof hosting to resist takedown pressure. Some recent interventions have focused on shutting down such sites by pressuring their upstream Internet service providers to deny them transit connectivity.

To further complicate takedowns and stymie blacklisting approaches, many spammers obfuscate the hosting relationship using fast-flux DNS. In this approach, domain records have short-lived associations with IP addresses, and the mapping infrastructure can spread the domain's presence over a large number of machines, frequently many thousands of compromised hosts that proxy requests back to the actual content server. Recently, innovators have begun packaging this capability to offer it to third parties on a contract basis as a highly resilient content-hosting service.

##### Stores and Affiliate Programs

Today, spammers primarily operate as advertisers, rarely handling the backend of the value chain. They often work as affiliates of an online store, earning a commission (typically 30–50%) on the sales they bring in. The affiliate program typically provides storefront templates, shopping cart management, analytics support, and even advertising materials. It also provides a centralized web service interface for affiliates to track visitor conversions and register for payouts (via online financial instruments such as WebMoney). Additionally, affiliate programs take responsibility for contracting payment and fulfillment services with outside parties. Affiliate programs have proven difficult to combat directly, although law enforcement has successfully shut down some programs when armed with sufficient legal jurisdiction.

#### Realization

Finally, having brought the customer to an advertised site and convinced them to purchase a product, the seller realizes the latent value by acquiring the customer's payment through conventional payment networks and fulfilling the product request.

##### Payment Services

To extract value from the broadest possible customer base, stores try to support standard credit card payments. A credit card transaction involves several parties in addition to the customer and merchant: money is transferred from the issuing bank (the customer's bank) to the acquiring bank (the merchant's bank) via a card association network (i.e., Visa or MasterCard). In addition to the acquiring bank, issuing bank, and card association, the merchant frequently employs the services of a payment processor to facilitate this process and act as the technical interface between the merchant and the payment system. Card associations impose contractual restrictions on their member banks and processors, including the threat of fines and de-association. However, little public documentation exists about the extent to which these pressures are applied in practice or their role in moderating the spam business. Evidence from this study suggests that any such pressure is currently insufficient to stop this activity.

##### Fulfillment

Finally, a store arranges to fulfill an order in return for the customer's payment. For physical goods such as pharmaceuticals and replica products, this involves acquiring the items and shipping them to the customer. Global business-to-business websites such as Alibaba, EC-Plaza, and ECTrade offer connections with a broad variety of vendors selling a range of such goods, including prepackaged drugs and replica luxury goods. Generally, suppliers offer direct shipping service ("drop shipping"), so affiliate programs can structure themselves around "just in time" fulfillment and avoid the overhead and risk of warehousing and shipping the product themselves. Fulfillment for virtual goods such as software, music, and videos can proceed directly via internet download.

### B. Pharmacy Express: An Example

Figure 1 illustrates the spam value chain through a concrete example from the empirical data used in this study. On October 27th, the Grum botnet delivered an email titled "VIAGRA R Official Site." The body of the message included an image of male enhancement pharmaceutical tablets and their associated prices. The image provided a URL tag, and when clicked, directed the user's browser to resolve the associated domain name, medicshopnerx.ru. This domain was registered by REGRU-REG-RIPN (a.k.a. reg.ru) on October 18th and was still active at the time of writing. The machine providing name service resided in China, while hosting resolved to a machine in Brazil. The user's browser initiated an HTTP request to the machine and received content that rendered the advertised site.
