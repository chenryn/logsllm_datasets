There are some cases where dpkg/apt can leave file like logging.yml.dpkg-dist
files in /etc/elasticsearch and LogConfigurator will pick them up by default.
This is bad because those files might contain garbage and break logging. Why
not _just_ pick up logging.yml? Is this something like the conf.d pattern?
