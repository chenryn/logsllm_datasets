Introduction
Overview of the Splunk Common Information ModelThe Common Information Model (CIM) is set of 22 pre-configured data models that you can apply to your data at search time. Each data model in the CIM consists of a set of field names and tags that define the least common denominator of a domain of interest.
Why the CIM existsWhy the CIM exists
The CIM helps you to normalize your data to match a common standard, using the same field names and event tags for equivalent events from different sources or vendors. The CIM acts as a search-time schema ("schema-on-the-fly") to allow you to define relationships in the event data while leaving the raw machine data intact.After you have normalized the data from multiple different source types, you can develop reports, correlation searches, and dashboards to present a unified view of a data domain. You can display your normalized data in the dashboards provided by other Splunk applications such as Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance. The dashboards and other reporting tools in apps that support CIM compliance display only the data that is normalized to the tags and fields defined by the Common Information Model.How to use this manual
This manual provides reference documentation for the fields and tags that make up each data model. Refer to the reference tables to determine what tags and fields are expected for each object in a data model as you work to normalize a new data source to the CIM.
This manual also provides a step-by-step guide for how to apply the CIM to your data at search time. This portion of the manual includes a walkthrough of the procedure you should follow to• normalize data to the CIM
• create reports and dashboards with CIM-compliant data

What data models are included 
The following data models are included in the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on. You can find the JSON implementations of the data models in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_SA_CIM/default/data/models.

How the Splunk CIM compares to the DMTF CIM
The Splunk Common Information Model is an independent standard, unaffiliated with the Distributed Management Task Force CIM.
The DMTF CIM is different from the Splunk CIM. The DMTF is more hierarchical, more complex, and more comprehensive than the Splunk CIM. In the DMTF CIM, all models inherit from a single parent node, with child nodes for each model, then additional branching child nodes for sub-concepts. Thus, the DMTF's individual sub-nodes can be very complex with multiple branches in order to define most possible configurations.In contrast, the Splunk CIM is relatively flat, simple, and flexible, because it defines only the least common denominator of concepts in a given domain rather than all possible concepts in the domain. The Splunk CIM defines fewer concepts than the DMTF CIM in order to give the developer maximum flexibility.
PrerequisitesPrerequisites
This manual assumes you are familiar with the full data lifecycle in the Splunk platform. If you are not yet sure how to get your data in, see the Getting Data In manual for more information on how to set up the Splunk platform to accept new data or to learn about the types of data the Splunk platform can index.
Get startedGet started
Install the Common Information Model Add-on to get started. Refer to the release notes and support and resource links if you encounter problems.
Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on
1. Download the Common Information Model add-on from Splunkbase.2. Review the default/indexes.conf. This index definition is deprecated in this version of the CIM but is included for backwards compatibility with older versions of Splunk Enterprise Security and the Splunk App for PCI Compliance. If you are already using these index definitions, proceed with your installation and adjust the summary index creation settings to match your preferences. If you are not already using these index definitions, remove this default/indexes.conf before3
installation. For more information on configuring indexes.conf, see "Create and edit indexes" and "Configure index size with volumes" in the Managing Indexers and Clusters of Indexers manual, part of the Splunk Enterprise documentation.
3. Install the Splunk Common Information Model Add-on to your search heads only. Installing this add-on to indexers results in redundant data model acceleration overhead if acceleration is enabled.Refer to "Installing add-ons" for detailed instructions describing how to install a Splunk add-on in the following deployment scenarios:
• single-instance Splunk Enterprise
• distributed Splunk Enterprise
• Splunk Cloud
• Splunk Light
4. (Optional) Visit that Splunk Common Information Model Add-on Set Up page to constrain the indexes that each datamodel searches against, to improve performance. Access the setup page by going to Apps > Manage Apps, and then clicking on Set up in the row for Splunk Common Information Model.5. (Optional) Accelerate one or more of the data models. The data models included in the CIM add-on are configured with data model acceleration turned off. For more details, see "Enable data model acceleration" in the Knowledge Manager Manual, part of the Splunk Enterprise documentation.

Data models
How to use these reference tables
Each topic in this section contains a use case for the data model, a breakdown of the required tags for the event objects or searches in that model, and a listing of all extracted and calculated fields included in the model.How to read the tags tables
The tags tables communicate which tags you must apply to your events in order to make them CIM-compliant. These tags act as constraints to identify your events as relevant to this data model, so that this data is included in Pivot reports and dashboards based on this model.There might be additional constraints outside the scope of these tables. Refer to the data model itself in Splunk Web for required fields, field=value combinations, or base searches that the model depends on.
Ensure your data is populated in the correct dashboards and Pivot reports.
1. Identify the CIM object relevant to your events.
2. Observe which tags are required for that object.3. Observe which tags are required for any parent objects.
4. Apply those tags to your events using event types.
5. Repeat for any additional relevant CIM objects.
For a detailed walkthrough of these steps, see "Use the CIM to normalize data at search time."
How to read the fields tablesHow to read the fields tables
The fields tables list the extracted and calculated fields for the event and search objects in the model and provide descriptions and expected values (if relevant) for these fields. The table presents the fields in alphabetical order, starting with the fields for the parent object in the model, then proceeding to any unique fields
77
for child objects. The table does not repeat any fields that a child object inherits from a parent object, so refer to the parent object to see the description and expected values for that field.Because the fields tables exclude inherited fields, many child objects have no fields listed in the table at all. Those child objects include only inherited fields from one or more of their parent objects, so there are no unique extracted or calculated fields to display. All data models inherit the fields _time, host, source, and sourcetype, so those fields are always available to you for use in developing Pivot reports and dashboards.Use the tables to apply the Common Information Model to your data
The tables in this section of documentation are intended to be supplemental reference for the data models themselves. Use the documentation and the data model editor in Splunk Web together.
1. In Splunk Web, go to Settings > Data Models to open the Data Model Manager.2. Click a data model to view it in the Data Model Editor. There, you can see the full object hierarchy, a complete listing of constraints for each object, and full listing of all inherited, extracted, and calculated fields for each object.
3. Compare this information with the reference tables in the documentation for descriptions and expected values of the fields in each object.
