User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Does Tor browser work with college network? I'm in a system where my modem connects to a college network (KotNet) that monitors its internet traffic.  Since I'd like some privacy I was wondering if a Tor browser would hide my identity or if it would not work since I first have to log in to the college net (with username and password) before I can have access to internet.

Assistant: The short answer is that any internet connection you access that is also tied to you personally (e.g. the login credentials on a college network) can be traced back to you. Therefore it is not suitable for full anonymity online. You enter your login credentials to access the network, the network admins can trace your connections through their network to a Tor node. Theoretically that should be all they can see because your traffic should be encrypted. But if your adversary is some No Sugar Added ice cream it might also be monitoring exit traffic of their hosted Tor nodes. This would make you risk a pairing up of your traffic with exit traffic.

If Tor will connect is a different question. This would depend on if your ISP (sometimes the college for many universities and colleges) has blacklisted any IPs. 

So, it really depends what you need the anonymity for. Investigative journalism critical of your host country? I'd say probably not a good idea. Avoiding the eyes of malicious non-state actors - You're probably okay to use it.

One other thing to consider is if your college bans Tor traffic and what policies regarding this are on your campus.
