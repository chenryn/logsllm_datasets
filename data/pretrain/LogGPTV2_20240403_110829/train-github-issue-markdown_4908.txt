    This text in the spec:
    ---
    As a special case, if the return parameters of a function or method g are equal in
    number and individually assignable to the parameters of another function or method f,
    then the call f(g(parameters_of_g)) will invoke f after binding the return values of g
    to the parameters of f in order. The call of f must contain no parameters other than the
    call of g. If f has a final ... parameter, it is assigned the return values of g that
    remain after assignment of regular parameters.
    ---
    doesn't preclude the following program:
    package main
    func f() {}
    func g() {}
    func main() {
      f(g())
    }
    though the tools reject it.
    The text should be amended to restrict the special case to functions g with more than
    one return parameter.
