There is a defect in the cron module when running on SuSE and other
distributions that add a header, three lines, to the user crontab file. Each
call to add/remove a job includes the previous header. After adding the code
to strip the header, I created a test suite outside ansible and found other
problems with the handling empty jobs and cron files. I should be able to
cleanup my changes and generate a pull request over the weekend.
