An estimator with multioutput support can be used for multilabel problems such
as `RandomForestClassifier`. Its `predict_proba` methods returns
scikit-learn/sklearn/ensemble/forest.py

|  p : array of shape = [n_samples, n_classes], or a list of n_outputs  
---|---  
|  such arrays if n_outputs > 1.  
Such estimators blends multilabel problems and multioutput problems because a
multilabel problem is a special multioutput one.
Most of the estimators don't support multilabel directly and
`OneVsRestClassifier` is required. Its `predict_proba` method returns
scikit-learn/sklearn/multiclass.py
Lines 337 to 339 in ee328fa
|  T : (sparse) array-like, shape = [n_samples, n_classes]  
---|---  
|  Returns the probability of the sample for each class in the model,  
|  where classes are ordered as they are in `self.classes_`.  
Therefore, for multilabel problems, these classes return different types of
results when calling `predict_proba`. It can introduce some issue, for
example, implementing multilabel support for `VotingClassifier`.
