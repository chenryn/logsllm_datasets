User: I'm running GAE SDK on a Windows Vista laptop. It keeps reminding me to install the SSL module. I've been having great difficulty on how to do that.
I've downloaded the SSL module.
I've done 'python setup.py install' in cmd, but it just says "python is not recognized as an internal..."
I've added C:\Python2.5.2 to my PATH.
Still the same message "python is not recognized as an internal or external command..."
What else should I do?
Assistant: Why don't you provide the complete path to python executable. That should work.
C:\"Python2.5.2"\python.exe setup.py install
