Common recommendation algorithms include: 1. Content-based recommendation: recommend similar items based on the characteristics of the item and the user's historical behavior. 2. Recommendation based on collaborative filtering: According to user behavior data, recommend items that users with similar interests like. 3. Deep learning recommendation: use the deep learning model to mine the complex relationship between users and items to improve the accuracy of recommendation. 4. Cluster recommendation: cluster users and items, and recommend according to different categories. 5. Recommendation based on matrix decomposition: Matrix decomposition is performed on the relationship between users and items, and recommendations are made through matrix reconstruction. 6. Rule-based recommendation: According to the user's historical behavior and the rules in the rule base, recommend items that meet the rules. In short, personalized recommendation needs to be realized by selecting appropriate algorithms and models according to different scenarios.
