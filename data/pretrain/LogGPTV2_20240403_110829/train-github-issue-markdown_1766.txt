I didn't notice any deviation from the behavior I expected from the component.

### component:
    export const Contract: FC = ({
      contract = demo_contract,
      hide,
      show
    }) => {
      if (!show) {
        return <>
      }
      const { user } = useAppSelector(store => store.users)
      const [loan_contract, set_loan_contract] = useState(compute_whole_contract(contract, user as User));
      useEffect(() => {
        set_loan_contract(compute_whole_contract(contract, user as User))
      }, [contract])
      return (
            Loan Contract
      )
    }
