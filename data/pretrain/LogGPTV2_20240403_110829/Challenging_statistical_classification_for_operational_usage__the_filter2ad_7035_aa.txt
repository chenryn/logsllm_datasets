## Abstract
Accurate identification of network traffic by application type is crucial for many companies, including Internet Service Providers (ISPs). For example, some companies may want to restrict peer-to-peer (P2P) traffic, while ISPs might offer additional services based on the application. To classify applications in real-time, most companies use deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions. Although DPI tools can be accurate, they require frequent updates to their signature databases. Recently, several statistical traffic classification methods have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the use of these methods for an ADSL provider managing multiple Points of Presence (PoPs). We demonstrate that statistical methods can achieve performance similar to DPI tools when the classifier is trained for a specific site. Additionally, statistical methods can complement existing DPI techniques by identifying traffic that DPI solutions fail to classify. However, we also show that a statistical model trained on one site cannot be directly applied to other locations due to the classifier learning site-specific information.

## 1. Introduction
For companies and ISPs, the ability to accurately identify the applications flowing through their networks is essential. This need arises from various motivations:
1. Enforcement of internal or national rules, such as banning P2P traffic from an intranet.
2. Better understanding of current and emerging applications.
3. Assessing the impact of these applications on peering agreements and return on investment for initiatives like P4P.
4. Offering additional services based on the application, such as protection for multimedia transfers.

The current state-of-the-art for most companies, including ISPs, involves using proprietary solutions that implement DPI techniques with signatures and heuristics to detect applications. While this approach can be accurate, it is expensive, does not scale well to high bandwidth, and requires constant updates to the signature database to detect new applications or usage patterns. Furthermore, the increasing trend of obfuscating traffic highlights the need for alternative detection methods. Recently, several machine learning-based solutions have been proposed in the literature, but these have primarily been tested on academic traces and use different traffic features and definitions of flows and application classes.

In this paper, we adopt the perspective of an ADSL provider and evaluate statistical classification as a complementary tool to DPI. Deploying DPI tools at every PoP can be costly, so a potential use case is to build a statistical classifier based on data from PoPs where DPI solutions are available and deploy it where DPI solutions are missing. Additionally, DPI tools often fail to identify a portion of traffic; in our traces, this unidentifiable traffic ranges from 8% to 24% of the bytes. A statistical classification solution could help reduce these values.

We collected several hours of traces from various ADSL PoPs of a French ISP. Our dataset is unique because the traces were captured during the same period (early 2008) and all PoPs are managed by the same ISP. Using these traces, we address the following issues:
- Can we achieve high classification accuracy for all applications of interest?
- Can statistical methods help in identifying traffic that DPI tools failed to classify?
- Is the statistical model representative of the applications, allowing us to train the classifier on one site and use it on another without specific adjustments or re-training? Can we use a statistical tool as an alternative to commercial DPI tools?

### Contributions
Our study makes two main contributions:
1. **Site-Specific Performance:**
   - Statistical classification can help reveal traffic left unknown by the ground truth establishment tool, reducing the amount of unidentifiable bytes by half.
   - Statistical classification is flexible enough to group traffic based on application rather than protocol, which is particularly important for HTTP, which supports various applications from email to video streaming.

2. **Cross-Site Performance:**
   - Average performance is good when considering all flows and applications, but results can deteriorate significantly for specific applications when the classifier is applied to a different site. This problem stems from overfitting, where the classifier learns site-specific characteristics used by local users and applications.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews related work. Sections 3 and 4 describe our data, reference point establishment method, and methodology. Section 5 presents the results of classification per site. Section 6 evaluates the classifier in cross-site experiments. Section 7 discusses how statistical classification can help in mining unknown traffic. Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Related Work
Various methods have been introduced to solve the traffic classification problem. Early approaches relied on port numbers, but the decreasing accuracy of this method led to the emergence of DPI solutions. DPI checks packet payloads against known application signatures, but the rise of encryption, obfuscation, and government regulations has challenged its effectiveness.

Newer approaches classify traffic by recognizing statistical patterns in observable attributes. Moore et al. [14] presented a statistical approach to classify traffic into different service types based on flow features. This line of inquiry has resulted in a variety of machine learning algorithms, flow features, and heuristics. A systematic survey of recent works is provided in [21].

Experience has shown that a small number of flow features can effectively differentiate services or network applications. In this work, we focus on the spatial stability of ADSL traffic classification, i.e., the ability to train a statistical classifier on one site and use it to monitor other sites. To our knowledge, only a few studies have tackled this problem similarly, but they considered either overly heterogeneous traces or academic environments with long periods between subsequent traces.

## 3. Traffic Data
In this section, we present our dataset, the method for establishing the reference point (ground truth), the definition of our traffic classes, and the traffic breakdown.

### 3.1 Dataset
Our dataset consists of four recent packet traces collected from three different ADSL PoPs in France, managed by the same ISP. All traces were captured using passive probes located behind a Broadband Access Server (BAS), which routes traffic to and from the DSLAMs and the Internet. The captures, which include full packet payloads, were performed without sampling or loss and contain over four million TCP flows. Each trace includes at least one hour of full bidirectional traffic, with a similar number of active local users ranging from 1380 to 2100. For details, see Table 1.

| Set | Date | Start | Duration | Size [GB] | Flows [M] | TCP [%] | TCP Bytes [%] | Local Users | Distant IPs |
|-----|------|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| MS-I | 2008-02-04 | 14:45 | 1h | 26 | 55 | 36 | 60 | 0.99 | 1.8 |
| R-II | 2008-01-17 | 17:05 | 1h 10m | 1.3 | 4.1 | 63 |  |

Traces have important spatial and temporal features: traces MSI and RIII were captured simultaneously at different locations, helping to assess the spatial stability of the method. Traces RII and RIII were captured at the same location with a 17-day offset.

### 3.2 Reference Point
To benchmark the performance of any classification method, a dataset with pre-labeled traffic classes is needed. We term this dataset our reference point (or ground truth). Establishing a reference point is fundamental for evaluating traffic classification mechanisms. As human-labeled datasets are impractical, we rely on DPI tools.

Signatures commonly used in recent works [12, 5] provide deceptive results with our traces, classifying more than 55% of the flows as unknown. We use an internal tool of Orange, termed the Orange DPI tool (ODT), which is under continuous development and in use at several Orange PoPs in France. ODT can detect several types of applications, including encrypted ones. We compared ODT to Tstat [20], and found ODT to be more suitable for our dataset.
