### 3.3.2 Stealthy Accounting Attack

This attack can be launched at any time and from any location. It can operate in conjunction with a spamming attack (§3.2) or any other ongoing data service, thereby forming a stealthy accounting attack. Given that IP packet delivery is connectionless, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the gateway to determine whether a zero-valued TTL is malicious (caused by an improper initial value set by attackers) or legitimate (due to delivery over too many hops).

#### 3.3.3 Experimental Validation

We confirmed the feasibility of this hit-and-no-touch attack, which also verifies the accounting loophole based on the local view at the core gateway. We varied the TTL values of the spam packets sent by the adversary and observed the volume gap between the gateway and the phone. The spamming volume was set to 5MB. Experiments were conducted for both carriers at ten different locations. Figure 11 illustrates the results at one location; the results at other locations were similar, validating its feasibility for both operators.

- **OP-I**: Feasible TTL choices are 26, 27, and 28.
- **OP-II**: Only one feasible TTL value: 18.

When the correct TTL parameter is used, the phone experiences unexpected and potentially unknown overcharging. Since consistent results were observed at all locations for each carrier, the feasible TTL values can be reused by other conspirators.

### 3.4 Root Causes

To address the root causes of MDC vulnerabilities, we re-examine the fundamental design principles of both cellular networks and the Internet. Both may share the blame for these security loopholes.

#### Cellular Network Design

Two design guidelines for MDC systems inadvertently create insecurity loopholes:

1. **Local View-Based Accounting**: MDC performs accounting operations based on the local view at the core gateway, resulting in an open-loop charging solution. Without feedback from mobile users, proper authorization for billed traffic is challenging, and accurate control of recorded traffic volume is difficult.
2. **Lack of Cross-Layer Security Binding**: While cellular networks use multi-layer security solutions, they do not enforce cross-layer security binding. This absence of runtime binding for security functions opens loopholes in authentication and authorization.

The current MDC design is largely inherited from legacy 2G cellular networks, which use circuit switching for voice calls. In contrast, 3G/4G networks use packet switching for data services. The open-loop charging design works well for 2G because virtual circuits (VCs) inherently provide closed-loop feedback. However, this feedback is absent in 3G/4G's connectionless data delivery.

#### Internet Design

Two features of network-layer IP data delivery contribute to the vulnerability:

1. **Push Delivery Model**: IP uses a push delivery model, allowing any device on the Internet to initiate packet delivery without prior consent. This facilitates unauthorized access and spamming.
2. **Source Address Spoofing**: Intermediate IP routers do not verify the authenticity of the source IP address, making IP address spoofing possible during data communications between a mobile device and an Internet host.

In summary, MDC security problems arise from using an inappropriate charging architecture (designed for circuit-switched voice transmission) for packet-switched data transmission.

### 4. Defense Solutions

We propose defense measures to protect the MDC system, ensuring compatibility with 3GPP standards for rapid deployment. Our solution framework has three main components:

1. **Authenticated and Verified ID**
2. **Coordinated Runtime Access Control**
3. **Accounting Alerts and Error Correction**

#### 4.1 ID Authentication and Verification

In MDC, two IDs, the Tunnel ID and the IP address, can serve as the charging ID. The Tunnel ID is authenticated on the control plane and verified for each packet on the data plane, while the IP address may not be verified for every packet.

**Solution:**
- **Cross-Layer Binding**: Bind the network-layer IP with the lower-layer bearer information (Tunnel ID) at the gateway. This ensures secure binding between the packet’s IP address and the UE’s authenticated IP.
- **Gateway Check**: Upon each packet arrival, the gateway checks if the source IP matches the IP stored in the UE’s EPS bearer. If not, the packet is discarded, and the UE is charged.

**Alternative Approach:**
- **MDC Based on Tunnel ID**: Use the trustworthy Tunnel ID directly for MDC. However, this restricts charging functions to cellular domain gateways and does not support existing IP-based or flow-based charging.

**Implementation:**
- **PCC Mechanism**: Use PCC rules to define pass and drop actions. Pass-type rules must specify the authenticated IP, while drop-type rules filter out unauthenticated traffic.
- **Penalties for Spoofers**: Authentic senders of discarded packets can be penalized by being billed for the discarded packets.

#### 4.2 Coordinated Runtime Access Control

Current practices suffer from authorization frauds due to insufficient information. To address this, we utilize user feedback to help the infrastructure determine whether access should be granted or denied in real-time.

**Solution:**
- **Implicit Authorization**: Data-plane access control uses implicit authorization, incurring low overhead and being more scalable.
- **Explicit De-Authorization**: On-demand explicit de-authorization is invoked on the control plane to block unwanted flows.
- **Fraud Detection**: A fraud detector at the UE identifies unauthorized flows and spam. User awareness mechanisms are introduced to prevent false positives.

**Implementation:**
- **PCC Mechanism**: Leverage dynamic PCC rules and add event triggers for implicit and explicit (de)authorization. Resource Modification Requests allow the UE to communicate with the PCC module to de-authorize specific flows.

By addressing these root causes and implementing the proposed defense measures, we aim to enhance the security and reliability of the MDC system.
