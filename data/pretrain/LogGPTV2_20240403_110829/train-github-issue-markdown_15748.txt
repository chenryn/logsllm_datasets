It seems that if you have many goroutines that do lookups, they are tied to
one routine that does the actual DNS resolve. If it succeeds, the answer is
provided to everyone and all is happy.
When it times out, rather than releasing everyone, all the goroutines must
also wait their time out too. It would make more sense to also release the
other routines with the errTimeout immediately.
