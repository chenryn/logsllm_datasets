User: It looks like there is more than one Python installed on my mac. 
Modules installed are not recognized by python interpreter (2.7.6) until I add them to PYTHONPATH. 
Could anyone show me how I can locate all the Pythons installed on my mac?
Thank you
Assistant: you can use which python command to find what python you are using. This gives the output as path to symlink, you can find the original python by reading the symlink.
