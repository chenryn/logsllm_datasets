User: I'm trying to deploy my GAE application - written with Python - on CapeDwarf  (WildFly_2.0.0.CR5).
But all the documentation talking only about Java Application.
So is CapeDwarf can deploy Python Application ?
if it is, how to do it ?
else any other application that can ?
Assistant: Yes, as Alex posted - CapeDwarf is Java only.
