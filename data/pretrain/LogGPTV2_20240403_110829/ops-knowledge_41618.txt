User: Hi I have a Django script that I need to run,
I think the commands could be called through bash.
Thing is the script causes memory leaks after a long a period of time, so I would like to create an external cron job which calls the Python script. So the script would terminate and restart while retaking the lost memory.

Can someone point me in the right direction? I know quite little on the subject, and feel a bit lost.
Assistant: The problem with a cron job is that it will start every so often regardless of whether the previous instance is finished. What I would recommend is to have your script start a new instance of itself after a certain amount of time, then exit.
