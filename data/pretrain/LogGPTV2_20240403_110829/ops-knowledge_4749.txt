User: How to alleviate the performance problems of applications under high concurrency?
Assistant: 1. Optimize database query and data structure 2. Use caching technology to reduce database query 3. Optimize code logic to reduce unnecessary repeated calculations and operations 4. Use distributed architecture to disperse applications to multiple servers 5. Important 6. Use CDN acceleration technology to improve the access speed of static resources 7. Reasonably set the thread pool size of the application to avoid excessive occupation of server resources 8. Use asynchronous programming to reduce blocking 9. Conduct performance testing and pressure Test, locate the problem and optimize it in time. 10. Use monitoring tools to monitor and analyze the performance of the application in real time.
