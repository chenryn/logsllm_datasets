User: I need to get the number of unique visitors(say, for the last 5 minutes) that are currently looking at an article, so I can display that number, and sort the articles by most popular.
ex. Similar to how most forums display 'There are n people viewing this thread'
How can I achieve this on Google App Engine? I am using Python 2.7.
Please try to explain in a simple way because I recently started learning programming and I am working on my first project. I don't have lots of experience. Thank you!
Assistant: There is no way to tell when someone stops viewing a page unless you use Javascript to inform the server when that happens. Forums etc typically assume that someone has stopped viewing a page after n minutes of inactivity, and base their figures on that.
For minimal resource use, I would suggest using memcache exclusively here. If the value gets evicted, the count will be incorrect, but the consequences of that are minimal, and other solutions will use a lot more resources.
