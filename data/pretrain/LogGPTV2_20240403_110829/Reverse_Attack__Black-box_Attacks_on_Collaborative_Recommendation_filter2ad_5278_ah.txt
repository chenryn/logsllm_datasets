injecting 5% fake users, our availability attack achieves the PRE@10

A.10 Attack on Dynamic Recommender
Systems
We further evaluate our attack performance upon the dynamic
recommender systems in terms of the PRE@10 and the HT @10
measures. am-b dataset is taken for experiments, where the first
426, 006 ratings according to the chronological timestamp order are
used as the original training dataset and the next 200, 000 ratings
are used as the test dataset. The test dataset is further divided
into 10 groups according to the chronological timestamp order. We
simulate a dynamic system resulting from adding those 10 test
data groups sequentially. NCF is employed to continuously train
the recommender system with the newly added data and make
recommendation for the next data group. We deploy availability
attack and target attack at each training phase, with the attack
ration set to 5%, to examine our attack performance. Table 16 shows
our attack results of the next data group. From the table, we can
see that the performance of our availability attack and target attack
fluctuate just slightly. That is, the PRE@10 and HT @10 values
fluctuate respectively from 49.6% to 52.2% and from 40.5% to 44.2%
only. This experiment demonstrates that our attack is effective to
dynamic recommender systems as well.
