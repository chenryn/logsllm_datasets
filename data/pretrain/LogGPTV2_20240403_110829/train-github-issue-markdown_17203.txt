We should make it possible to update some parts of sysimg (e.g. different
stdlibs) to let all Julia versions use bug fixes without the need to update
Julia.
One solution may be to use separate files for each stdlib, which Pkg can
update them.
I have seen this issue a lot in the pull requests and issues. People avoid
adding a feature to Julia because they are afraid they cannot update it later
in case some change is needed. Some examples: #36326, #36223, Pkg's artifacts
system, etc.
