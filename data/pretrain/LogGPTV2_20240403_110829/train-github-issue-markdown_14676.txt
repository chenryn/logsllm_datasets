### Context
I have a Neo4j dashboard running on port 7474, which is behind a reverse proxy configured to use HTTPS (port 443).

### Issue
When I attempt to access the dashboard via HTTPS, I am redirected to HTTP. Here are the details of the issue:

```sh
curl -ILk 'https://neo4j-redirect-issue/' -H 'Accept: text/html'
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: https://neo4j-redirect-issue/browser
Content-Type: text/html
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Server: Jetty(9.0.5.v20130815)

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://neo4j-redirect-issue/browser/
Server: Jetty(9.0.5.v20130815)

curl: (7) Failed to connect to neo4j-redirect-issue port 80: Connection refused
```

In this sequence, the scheme (HTTPS) is preserved in the first 303 redirect but is lost in the subsequent 302 redirect, where it reverts to HTTP.

### Expected Behavior
I expect the scheme to be maintained throughout all redirects. Specifically, a request to `https://neo4j-redirect-issue/` should ultimately redirect to `https://neo4j-redirect-issue/browser/`.

### Summary
- **Current Behavior**: The initial 303 redirect maintains the HTTPS scheme, but the subsequent 302 redirect changes it to HTTP.
- **Expected Behavior**: All redirects should preserve the HTTPS scheme.
