### Context
I have a neo4j dashboard (7474) behind a reverse proxy binded on https (443)
### What I get
When trying to access the dashboard from https I get redirected to http
    curl -ILk 'https://neo4j-redirect-issue/' -H 'Accept: text/html' 
    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    Location: https://neo4j-redirect-issue/browser
    Content-Type: text/html
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Server: Jetty(9.0.5.v20130815)
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: http://neo4j-redirect-issue/browser/
    Server: Jetty(9.0.5.v20130815)
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to neo4j-redirect-issue port 80: Connection refused
Here we see the scheme is kept in the first 303 redirect, but lost in the next
302 (when adding the trailing slash).
### What I expect
I expect the scheme to be kept along all redirects so a call to
`https://neo4j-redirect-issue/` end up to `https://neo4j-redirect-
issue/browser/`
