Question: A DNS server has just resolved a query for a domain and returned a set of records as part of its DNSSEC implementation. Given the following information, identify the roles that the associated DNSSEC records play in this scenario: A `DNSKEY` record is present along with an `RRSIG` record signing multiple `A` type records, and a `DS` record exists in conjunction with another `RRSIG` record for it.
"A": "The DNSKEY record contains the public key used to verify the RRSIG signature over the A type records.",
"B": "The RRSIG record attached to the A type records can be used to hash the set of records for ensuring integrity.",
"C": "The DS record serves as a secure reference to the public key of a child domain name server.",
"D": "The additional RRSIG record for the DS record provides a signature to authenticate the source of the DS record."
Answer: ACD
