**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior** :
According to the reference mapping-type index page and to the associated
reference meta-fields index page as well as the reference _meta field page,
this was supposed to run successfully on a 2.3.x cluster:
**Steps to reproduce** :
DELETE /tweet  
PUT /tweet
PUT /tweet/tweet/_mapping
    {
      "properties": {
        "tweet": {
          "type": "string",
          "analyzer": "english",
          "_meta": {
            "label": "This is a tweet body."
          }
        },
        "date": {
          "type": "date"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "user_id": {
          "type": "long"
        },
        "_meta": {
          "label": "This is a tweet object."
        }
      },
      "_meta": {
        "label": "This is a tweet database."
      }
    }
**Answer** :
    {
      "error": {
        "root_cause": [
          {
            "type": "mapper_parsing_exception",
            "reason": "Mapping definition for [tweet] has unsupported parameters:  [_meta : {label=This is a tweet body.}]"
          }
        ],
        "type": "mapper_parsing_exception",
        "reason": "Mapping definition for [tweet] has unsupported parameters:  [_meta : {label=This is a tweet body.}]"
      },
      "status": 400
    }
Issue #9649 mentioned it, and at the end it was commented that this was
implemented and available. So I'm assuming it was either removed without a doc
sync or it was broken recently. However, a quick lookup at the code searching
for "_meta" got me to no place where MapperRegistry was ever used to register
a Mapper for "_meta" attribute. I'm looking forward to being proven wrong
though.
