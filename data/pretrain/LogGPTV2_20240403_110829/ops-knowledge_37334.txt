User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: If you locate the idlelib directory in your Python install, it will have a few files with the .def extension. config-main.def has instructions on where to put the custom config files. However, looking through these I did not find any configurable paths (your install may vary). Looks like you might need to crack open the editor code to alter it.
