**Question:**
Does anyone know how to set the default path or directory for saving Python scripts before running them? On a Mac, the system defaults to saving them in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different location. Any suggestions?

**Answer:**
To set a custom default save directory for Python scripts, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locate the `idlelib` Directory:**
   - The `idlelib` directory is part of your Python installation. You can typically find it within the `lib` directory of your Python environment. For example, if you are using Python 3.9, the path might be something like:
     ```
     /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/lib/python3.9/idlelib
     ```

2. **Check for Configuration Files:**
   - Within the `idlelib` directory, look for files with the `.def` extension. One of these files, `config-main.def`, contains instructions on where to place custom configuration files.

3. **Customize Configuration:**
   - Review the `config-main.def` file and any other relevant configuration files. Unfortunately, the default configuration files do not provide an option to set a custom save directory directly. 

4. **Modify the Editor Code:**
   - If you need to change the default save directory, you may have to modify the source code of the IDLE editor. This involves:
     - Locating the relevant Python script in the `idlelib` directory that handles file saving.
     - Editing the script to set your desired default directory.
     - Rebuilding or restarting IDLE to apply the changes.

Please note that modifying the editor code requires some programming knowledge and should be done with caution to avoid breaking the functionality of IDLE.

If you prefer not to modify the code, you can also consider using a different text editor or IDE that allows you to set a custom save directory, such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.
