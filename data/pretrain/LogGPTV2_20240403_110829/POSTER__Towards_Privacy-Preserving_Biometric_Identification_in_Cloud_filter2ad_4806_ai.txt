play a crucial role in multimodal representation and the selected error-correction
algorithm should be evaluated to avoid an increase of the FRR that may render
the system more vulnerable to attacks at the levels of the matching and decision.
Even if a uniﬁed protection scheme for multimodal schemes would be valuable, its
practicality is still under evaluation. Feature fusion oﬀers adequate performance
accuracy. However, it fails to address the address the issue of availability for a
certain type of modalities. Additionally, due to its complexity, it is considered
ineﬀective for high security real-world multimodal applications. Finally, we
analyzed the security advantages of an approach based on fusion at the decision
level, combined with the cryptographic technique of biometric cryptosystems.
We discussed the importance of the security requirement for renewability and the
directions to address it in multimodal architectures. Our work has oﬀered a tool
to address open research questions and it has contributed to the development
of privacy-preserving, practical solutions for multimodal recognition systems.
3.3.3 Security and Privacy Analysis of the Basic Techniques
The number of publications on the analysis side of the cryptographic mechanisms
and the design of new protection schemes and their applications to diﬀerent
modalities has been increasing in the last years. Research presents numerous
approaches and tools to handle the vulnerabilities of biometric encryption
techniques. Moreover, empirical evaluations have led to the proposal of new
solutions. These approaches have been implemented in minimal data (minutiae
ﬁngerprints), multi-factor and multibiometric designs. In [211], we presented
a theoretical evaluation of biometric cryptosystems in secure multimodal
architectures. We described how privacy can be addressed and we discussed the
security advantages of this approach against the attacks at the level of the sensor.
Furthermore, our work in [213] discussed to what extent biometric designs can
be characterized as Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs). We analyzed and
compared the existing approaches that address security and privacy in biometric
designs. Below, we summarize our ﬁndings.
The technique of features transformation oﬀers a minimum level of security.
However, it is seen as the basis for the template protection technique of cancelable
biometrics. The mechanism can be applied in unibiometric templates and
minimal data, while for multibiometric designs that require the selection of
a fusion strategy, non-invertible can be eﬃciently applied. However, salting
approaches for multimodal schemes are not considered as an eﬃcient solution due
to the complexity and the reduction of the overall accuracy. The experimental
analysis of Nandakumar and Jain [149] concluded that complex transformations
may reduce the authentication performance. This is a common problem for
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
45
transformation approaches that is mainly caused by the information loss and
the diﬃculty in the alignment of the templates.
Cancelable biometrics present several advantages as they can be applied to
unimodal and minimal data. The main advantage of this technique is that
it provides a larger number of protected templates from the same biometric
data and it prevents the use of the same references across multiple applications.
Msgna et al. evaluated in [146] the practicality of this method. Their experiments
focused on a possible change of human characteristics due to time or injury
and they analyzed how these factors lead to intrinsic failures. According to
their ﬁndings, even if the requirements of non-invertibility, unlinkability and
cancelability are preserved, cancelable template protection approaches fail to
address the principle of renewability. This requires an non-automated re-issuance
of the biometric templates after an attack, while the applicable alignment
algorithms may aﬀect performance.
The technique of biometric cryptosystems suﬀers from security–performance
trade-oﬀ issues. However, during the last decade, fuzzy commitment schemes
have attracted much attention, Schaller et al. [189]. Nowadays, they are
considered a widely used cryptographic method, being one of the most suitable
approaches for commercial applications that demand large-scale DBs for the
storage of biometric information and high robustness against multiple attacks,
Li and Jain [122]. Hence, these hybrid privacy-aware approaches have been
broadly used in biometric unimodal and minimal data deployments with high
complexity, Riccio et al. [177]. For multimodal designs, the presented intra-class
variations and the required error-correcting codes may reduce the reliability
of the technique. Hence, it is not a mechanism that can be characterized by
high ﬂexibility due to the computational complexity. However, research into
this direction is continued where recent works evaluated the applicability of
cryptosystems in biometric recognition systems, identifying their weaknesses in
both authentication and identiﬁcation schemes, suggesting promising measures
to improve their eﬃciency, Adamovic et al. [6] and Lafkih et al. in [117].
Finally, our work in [213] focused on the technique of Pseudonymous Biometric
Identities (PIs) from biometric data. We have analyzed the challenges of privacy-
by-design biometric architectures. PIs preserve the privacy principles of ISO
standards as addressed in [92] while they also respect the GDPR [66] principles
for data protection. The mechanism involves individualized comparison
parameters to optimize the performance, oﬀering cancelability, renewability and
allowing the automated re-issuance of the templates after an attack. It also allows
the creation and communication of multiple PIs for the same user in distributed
environments, for instance cloud-based designs that demand high ﬂexibility. The
security requirements of conﬁdentiality and the privacy principle of anonymity
are also satisﬁed. Hence, it is an approach that can overcome the limitations
46
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
of the other basic mechanisms, Ngo et al. [151]. However, the integration of
multimodal data and the optimum trade-oﬀ between the performance of the
fusion methods and the overall robustness are currently studied by the research
community. The interoperability of the method between a variety of applications
and the integration of minimal data as an input (e.g., minutiae ﬁngerprints) is
still evaluated for several threat scenarios. To facilitate the reader, we map the
advantages and disadvantages of the basic cryptographic techniques in Table 3.1.

3.3.4 Alternative Approaches for Unimodal and Multibiomet-
ric Designs
Several works in the literature have proposed solutions as an alternative to
the basic cryptographic approaches. They mainly rely on the distribution of
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
47
data and functionalities over diﬀerent parties according to the requirements
of the application environment. As mentioned in Section 3.1, a biometric
recognition system consists of a number of logical subsystems such as the sensor,
the communication channels and the storage area. In some applications these
entities are physically separated from each other and there are numerous security
and privacy concerns that we need to consider in order to eﬀectively address
the exposure of private information. To this end, many protocols have been
developed that rely on particular cryptographic primitives for the protection
of biometric data, allowing user authentication (e.g., by verifying that the key
extracted from the new template of the biometric data matches the key that was
generated after the enrollment of the user). The most well known solutions use
hybrid approaches of the basic protection models combined with Homomorphic
Encryption schemes or Multi-Party Computation (MPC) techniques that can
be used in centralized and distributed biometric authentication domains.
Akdogan et al. proposed in [8] a secure key agreement protocol based on
Hamming Distance matching techniques and cancelable biometrics to enhance
the security of a ﬁngerprint biometric scheme against brute force, replay and
impersonation attacks. The work of Inamdar and Dandawate [90] introduced a
multimodal system which combines a technique for fusion at the feature level
with an Euclidean Distance matching algorithm. The data are encrypted using
the mechanism of crypto-biometrics where the keys are generated by the feature
extraction parameters and the computation primitives. Jin et al. [103] proposed
a hybrid cryptographic method focused on fuzzy commitment mechanisms in
order to address not only on the security requirements of non-invertibility,
revocability and renewability, but also the privacy principle of minimization.
Several works have presented similar approaches for unimodal and multimodal
schemes, Mai et al. [128] and Yang et al. [228], among others.
The purpose of Homomorphic Encryption is to perform computations on
encrypted data in untrusted environments, Rivest et al. [178]. The development
of Fully Homomorphic Encryption that supports arbitrary computations has
greatly extended the scope of applications that demand processing over
encrypted data homomorphically, Gentry [73]. Such schemes enable the
generation of encrypted inputs for any given functionality, producing an
encryption of the result that can be used by untrusted parties within a
computation domain (e.g., cloud computing), without exposing private data,
Armknecht et al. [14]. The work of Torres et al. [214] is not the ﬁrst that
attempts to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes
to preserve user privacy in biometric models. Although the protocols in the
literature oﬀer promising security results and manage to address the properties
of non-invertibility, cancelability and renewability, they are very computationally
intensive. Their major limitation is the trade-oﬀ between computations in the
48
METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIOMETRIC DATA
encrypted domain and the time for matching execution along with the size of the
DB and the key length that signiﬁcantly slows the computational speed. However,
literature has analyzed the ﬁeld in depth, proposing diﬀerent protocols trying
to make them more secure and privacy-preserving, improving the eﬃciency of
Homomorphic Encryption schemes and rendering them practical for several
biometric-based applications, such as cloud computing and electronic voting
schemes, Barrero et al. [77]. An important problem that arises for distributed
approaches (i.e., when the computation is outsourced to an untrusted domain)
is the correctness of the computations performed by the web-based environment
that may aﬀect the conﬁdentiality of the outsourced data, Abidin [2], Abidin
and Mitrokotsa [3]. Thus, the design of privacy-preserving models is necessary
in order to guarantee the protection of biometric data towards malicious parties
who aim to learn information on the computation parameters and to modify the
process which can lead to leakage of user data, Mandal et al. [133]. To conclude,
it is noted that the state-of-the-art is mature in the ﬁeld of Homomorphic
Encryption schemes, presenting many promising results and any further analysis
falls outside the scope of this thesis.
Blanton and Aliasgari applied MPC techniques to achieve security and privacy in
biometric schemes [25]. They designed a framework for outsourced computation
for iris matching that can be implemented in a cloud setting. Other unimodal
architectures include the model of Xiang et al. in [225] who introduced a
privacy-preserving protocol for face recognition with outsourced computation
and the cloud-based design of Zhu et al. in [232] that provides an eﬃcient model
for privacy-preserving unimodal identiﬁcation. Finally, Sarier [187] introduced
the ﬁrst protocol resistant to hill-climbing attacks for multimodal biometric
authentication in the cloud, working with Euclidean Distance for the matching
procedures on encrypted stored templates.
Our contribution. In [208], we described how MPC can be used in biometric
recognition technologies. We analyzed the privacy beneﬁts of this approach and
we studied the security concerns that may occur during the calculation phases
of recognition, from the interactions between untrusted parties. Motivated by
the outcomes of this research, we proposed in [207] a complete privacy-by-
design model for multimodal user authentication. Speciﬁcally, the veriﬁcation
setup was designed to function as an expert system, using previously stored
biometric templates that are held by distinct cloud-based identity providers.
Our protocols were based on MPC techniques in order to allow mutually
distrusting parties to jointly compute the matching score without revealing
any private information, maintaining the authenticity and conﬁdentiality of
users’ data. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art in cloud-based biometric
identity management architectures that use Homomorphic Encryption or MPC
techniques, our design provided multimodal authentication without having
CRYPTOGRAPHIC MECHANISMS FOR BIOMETRIC DESIGNS
49
to re-enroll the users, preventing any additional biometric extraction and
storage of private information. Finally, to obtain a multimodal fused result, we
utilized Hamming Distance algorithms and a user-speciﬁc weighted score level
fusion method. According to our security and privacy analysis, our decentralized
approach leverages the advantages of multimodal biometrics and the eﬃciency of
the underlying primitives, characterized by dynamic functionality and ﬂexibility
in terms of computation and communication eﬃciency.

Conclusion and Future Work
In this chapter, we present the main contributions and conclusions of this thesis
and we discuss some directions for future research.
4.1 Conclusion
In this work, we focused on the integration of multiple biometrics. In
collaboration with colleagues from the Biometric System Laboratory of the
University of Bologna we identiﬁed the types of biometrics that can be
consolidated into a fusion model. We implemented minutiae-based ﬁngerprints
and we compared diﬀerent cryptographic algorithms and mechanisms to study
the system’s behavior under realistic scenarios. Furthermore, we analyzed the
recognition performance for diﬀerent approaches and we described why the
accuracy of fusion strategies is the key asset in the design of multimodal
architectures. Motivated by our ﬁndings, we investigated the impact of the
performance metrics on the selection and the applicability of fusion approaches.
We observed how these elements can increase the complexity of cryptographic
methodologies. Our ﬁnding showed that multimodalities can increase the user’s
recognition precision and reliability. However, it is necessary to select the
appropriate cryptographic technique in order to prevent the degradation of the
scheme’s overall accuracy. Fortunately, the last few years, there has been a
steady improvement that oﬀers deeper insights into this problem.
Additionally, we studied several cryptographic techniques for the secure
transmission and storage of biometric data. We described the privacy principles,

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
the security recommendations and the properties for the implementation of
biometric designs in privacy-preserving applications. We extensively analyzed
the advantages and limitations of each strategy in the context of the existing ISO
Standards for the protection of biometric information [92] and [96]. Furthermore,
we investigated how the new security recommendations could be fulﬁlled as
addressed in the European GDPR [66] and the European Regulatory Technical
Standards for Strong Customer Authentication [183]. Our analysis showed
that each protection approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Although for
biometric developments, international standards and regulations legally specify
the formats for the secure handling of user’s data, the number of modalities, the
platform, the software interface and the functionality of the ﬁnal application
