C. Lueless
B. Rightlad
Mission: Perform a weekly vulnerability 
scan of all our public IP addresses 
C. Lueless…
Decides to use a regular vulnerability scanner…
…needs to get up very early
…manually starts his scan and waits…
…finishes the scan and goes back to sleep…
… and analyzes the report in the morning
B. Rightlad
Uses Seccubus…
… he spends the morning configuring Seccubus…
… goes home …
... Relaxes …
… the scanning happens at night …

… he can analyze the findings and remediate
Problem description
»
Nessus is a very powerful vulnerability scanner
»
‘Free’ (As in beer) TCP/IP security scanner
»
Best valued security scanner (sectools.org survey of 2000, 2003 and 2006)
»
Nessus generates a lot of output. Maybe too much?
»
Scanning takes a lot of time and is not automated
»
A lot of time is spent on analysis
»
Nessus GUI is not great for analyzing scans
»
Work risk ratio
What is Seccubus…
»
Seccubus is a wrapper around vulnerability scanners
»
GUI is geared towards analyzing and “ticking-off” findings that have been seen
»
Compares consecutive scans
»
Supports multiple scanners:
•
Nessus
•
OpenVAS
•
Nikto
•
More to follow
What does Seccubus do differently?
Scanning is started from the command line
»
This means it can be started from cron
The findings are stored in a “database”
»
Currently the database is a directory structure
Presentation via a WebGUI
»
Easy triage via filtering
»
Status allows you to “tick-off” findings
What happened under the hood?
The Nessus client was started via the command line.
Results where saved as:
»
HTML
»
XML (No longer supported as of Nessus 4.x)
»
NBE
A Seccubus scan…
Let us commence to week two

Nessus backend (.NBE) format
Simpel format
 |  |  |  |  |  | 
Findings have all fields populated, e.g.:
»
results|192.168.157|192.168.157.30|ntp (123/udp)|10884|Security Note|\nSynopsis :\n\nAn NTP 
server is listening…
For open ports, only the first four fields are populated, e.g.:
»
results|192.168.157|192.168.157.20|ssh (22/tcp)
Findings are converted to a directory structure

This tree structure can be easily used to compare consecutive scans
It’s all about status...
Assigned by Seccubus
NEW
Found for the first time
CHANGED
Output has changed
GONE
Not found anymore
Assigned by the User
OPEN
Risk
NO ISSUE
No risk
FIXED
Should not trigger again
HARD MASKED
Ignore this
Hard masked, Gone, Fixed, etc...
HARD MASKED
Will be ignored
GONE / FIXED
Keeps its status untill found again
OPEN / NO ISSUE
Keeps its status untill output changes
CHANGED
Was NO ISSUE or OPEN, but output changed
NEW
Was GONE or FIXED, but reappeared
...WHY MAKE A FUZZ?
IF IT IS OK, IT IS OK
The scanning cycle...

Assign status:
• New

Recap…
Monthly scanning with Nessus would mean:
»
Getting up a night to manually start the scans
»
Looking at non-informative findings (e.g. traceroute) every month
»
A lot of boring repetative work, high change of errors
»
A lot of work even if there are no changes to the infrastructure
So…
Monthly Seccubus runs means:
»
Scans are scheduled via crontab
»
Only the findings that need attention get it
»
Less errors due to less repetitave work.
»
The amount of effort is proportional to the amount of changes
»
Risk is proportional to the amount of changes

Why did we develop and release an open source tool?
We needed it!
We decided to give something back because we use a lot of open source tools:
»
Nagios
»
CFEngine
»
Rancid
»
MRTG
»
RRD tool 
»
Cacti
»
“LAMP”
»
CVS

Roadmap...
What is up for next versions of Seccubus?
Have a database backend
»
Better performance
»
Easier to link multiple findings to a single 
issue
»
Easier to link a single finding to multiple 
issues
Support more scanners
»
Nikto (v1.5)
»
NMAP (v2.0)
»
Metasploit/Metasploit express (v2.1)
»
Others ?
Open architecture:
»
More scanners can be added
»
Pluggable authentication?
»
Trouble ticket integration?
