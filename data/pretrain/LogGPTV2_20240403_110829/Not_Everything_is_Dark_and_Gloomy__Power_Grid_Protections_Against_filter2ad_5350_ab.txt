To increase the frequency of the power grid and prevent generators from disconnecting, as discussed previously, overcurrent protection is essential. If the current in a transmission line exceeds a certain threshold, a protection relay will be triggered after a specific time, T. This activation time is determined by an equation for current relays [10], which we will detail when describing our cascade outage analysis model.

**Figure 2: Analysis of Cascading Outages**

Most industry efforts on cascading studies focus on smaller-scale events that initiate a cascade, where transient dynamics have a minimal impact on the cascade analysis. Examples include the Transmission Reliability Evaluation of Large-Scale Systems (TRELSS) [32, 39] and the Oak Ridge-PSERC-Alaska (OPA) [18]. System operators like ERCOT [3] have also studied similar problems. Our tool, however, is designed to analyze large disruptions in power system operations, such as deliberate cyber attacks that can disable hundreds of lines in a short time. Therefore, our approach integrates both transient and steady-state analysis.

The integration of (1) system dynamics, (2) AC power flow, and (3) the timing of protection equipment provides our tool with a level of fidelity that surpasses current state-of-the-art practices [22, 27, 28, 34, 35, 40, 41, 57]. These three analysis techniques and their relationships are illustrated in Figure 2.

### 2.3 Contributions

Our contributions to the study of MadIoT attacks, compared to recent work [24, 47], include the following:

1. **Combined Transient and Steady-State Simulations:**
   - Previous work considered transient and steady-state simulations separately, leading to inconsistencies in different power systems. Consequently, the transient impacts on generators and system frequencies were not captured in the power flow simulations, resulting in different predictions of cascading outages. In contrast, our model includes the transient effects, which can prevent a system blackout through Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS).

2. **Accurate Timing of Protection Relays:**
   - We incorporate the exact timing for the activation of protection relays, reflecting the realistic behavior of power grid equipment. Previous works [28, 34] did not account for the delay characteristics of protection equipment, using models that assumed immediate removal of elements after overload. Our model, based on manufacturer curves [2, 10], captures the relationship between the overload and the trip time, providing a more accurate representation of the system's response to overloads.

3. **Large-Scale Transient Analysis:**
   - We perform the first large-scale transient analysis of MadIoT attacks on a real-world North American regional system with over 5,000 buses. Our analysis shows that powerful MadIoT attacks can partition the bulk power system into three or more isolated islands, making each island more vulnerable to future contingencies. This is a new effect that has not been considered before.

4. **New Variations of MadIoT Attacks:**
   - Since repeating the same attack conditions from previous work did not cause any blackout in our system, we introduce new variations of MadIoT attacks. For example, the attacker systematically creates demand oscillations to drive the system into a more vulnerable state before launching the second stage of the attack.

5. **Industry-Standard Simulations:**
   - All our simulations are conducted using PowerWorld [4], an industry-standard tool for transient and AC steady-state analysis. This ensures that the basic physics of the system are represented with industry-accepted fidelity.

These contributions are summarized in Table 1.

### 3. Cascading Outage Analyzer

This section summarizes our Cascading Outage Analyzer (COA) tool. The COA model considers both steady-state and transient stability analysis at different time scales, ensuring a coordinated transition between operating points. The basic model checks for conditions that trigger protective relays and assesses the timing of relay activations.

#### 3.1 Protection of Generators

If a mismatch between generation and load occurs, the system frequency deviates from the nominal value. A significant frequency deviation may trigger generator under- and over-frequency protections. Transient stability, or rotor angle stability, is the system's ability to remain synchronized during large transient disturbances [37]. We use the PowerWorld transient stability solver to calculate the system response after a fault. If the rotor angle deviation of a generator exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 100 degrees), the generator will be tripped to prevent permanent damage. The disconnection is not immediate but depends on the duration of the unsafe condition.

#### 3.2 Preventing the Tripping of Generators

When the system loses a generator or experiences a sudden load increase, the frequency decreases rapidly. To counter this, Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) is employed. UFLS, as per IEEE C37.117, sheds connected loads in case of insufficient generation or transmission capacity. We include UFLS and over/under frequency generator tripping in the COA model, contributing to the differences in results compared to previous work.

#### 3.3 Overcurrent Protection

Overcurrent protection is triggered based on the results from our steady-state analysis. The status and dispatch set points of units at the end of the PowerWorld transient analysis are used as starting points for the PowerWorld AC power flow simulator. An inverse-time overcurrent equation from the Siemens SIPRO-TEC 5 Current Relay [10] is implemented. The trip time, T, is determined by the equation:
\[ T = \left( \frac{I}{I_{th}}^{0.14} \right)^{0.02} - 1 \times T_p [s] \]
where \( I_{th} \) is the current threshold value, \( T_p \) is the setting value, and \( I \) is the current on the monitored component. Overloading the line does not immediately result in an outage; instead, the line sags. Simplified models that do not account for this behavior may produce inaccurate results.

#### 3.4 Over/Under Voltage Protection

Under or over voltage problems are common in cascading outages. When the system is stressed, bus voltages may decline. If a bus voltage falls below the lower limit, a load-shedding mechanism is triggered to return the bus voltages to acceptable levels. We implement a standard inverse time characteristic equation from the ABB RXEDK 2H time over/under voltage relay [2] to determine the timing for voltage protection activation. The trip time, T, is given by:
\[ T = \frac{k}{\left( \frac{U}{U_{th}} \right)^{-1}} [s] \]
\[ T = \frac{k}{1 - \left( \frac{U}{U_{th}} \right)} [s] \]
where \( k \) is the inverse time constant, \( U_{th} \) is the relay pick-up value, and \( U \) is the user-defined relay operating value. Over/under voltages do not immediately result in a bus outage.

### 4. Considerations for Modeling the Impact of IoT Attacks

This section demonstrates the contribution of our cascading outage analyzer in studying IoT demand attacks and compares our results with previous work. We start with a simple Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) model with 9 buses and 9 lines, as used in previous work. We will also discuss our considerations for modeling the impact of IoT attacks and provide a detailed study on a real-world North American system in the next section.

#### 4.1 The Need for Combining Transient and Steady-State Simulations

The operation of a power system after a disturbance is a continuous process. A closed-loop structure of the cascading outage analyzer better approximates the system's operation over various time scales. The results and states of the system after the transient simulation are used as the starting point for the steady-state simulations. Any cascading outages generated from the steady-state simulations are then used as initial conditions for the next transient simulation loop.

Previous work treated transient and steady-state simulations separately, leading to inconsistencies. For example, if a transmission line is removed due to overcapacity in the WSCC 9-bus system, the steady-state power flow would indicate a line outage between bus 7 and bus 8. However, the transient impacts of the sudden load increase caused by a MadIoT attack would not be captured, leading to different predictions. In reality, UFLS would activate before generators start tripping, preventing a system blackout.

**Figure 4: PowerWorld 9-bus system.**

**Figure 5: Power flow results of 15% load increase.**

However, because of the sudden load increase caused by the MadIoT attack, load and generation are not balanced, and the system frequency drops. Without considering the transient effects, the power flow solution would indicate a system blackout, while in reality, UFLS would activate and prevent it.
