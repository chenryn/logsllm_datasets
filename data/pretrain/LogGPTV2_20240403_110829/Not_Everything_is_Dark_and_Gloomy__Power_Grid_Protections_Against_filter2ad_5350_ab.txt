to increase the frequency of the power grid, and prevent
generators from being disconnected (as discussed in the
point above).
3. Overcurrent Protection: if the current in a transmis-
sion line is too high, a protection relay will be triggered
after time T . This activation time is based on an equa-
tion for current relays [10]. We will discuss in detail this
equation when we describe our cascade outage analysis
model.
Figure 2: Analysis of Cascading Outages.
Therefore most of the industry efforts on cascading stud-
ies focus on smaller-scale events that initiate a cascade, and
where the transient dynamics do not affect the cascade analy-
sis too much. These efforts include the Transmission Reliabil-
ity Evaluation of Large-Scale Systems (TRELSS) [32,39] and
the Oak Ridge-PSERC-Alaska (OPA) [18]. Similar problems
have been studied by system operators like ERCOT [3]. Our
tool on the other hand is designed for the study of the large
disruptions in the operation of a power system like a delib-
erate cyber attack which can take hundreds of lines out in a
short time, and therefore transient analysis has to be coupled
with steady-state analysis.
The integration of (1) System dynamics, (2) AC power
ﬂow, and (3) the timing of protection equipment gives our
tool a level of ﬁdelity that goes beyond the current state-of-
the-art practices [22, 27, 28, 34, 35, 35, 40, 41, 41, 57]. These
three analysis techniques and their relationship are shown in
Figure 2.
2.3 Contributions
Our contributions to the study of a MadIoT attacks compared
to recent work [24, 47] include the following:

USENIX Association
First, previous work considered transient and steady state
simulation as separate use-cases (and in different inconsistent
power systems), and as a result, the transient impacts on gen-
erators and system frequencies are not present in the power
ﬂow simulations. Therefore the predictions of cascading out-
ages can differ between the two simulations. As we explain
in Section 4.1, without the transient effect, the power ﬂow
solution will indicate a system blackout, while in reality Un-
der Frequency Load Shedding will activate before generators
start tripping and will prevent a system blackout.
Second, including the exact timing for the activation of a
protection relay captures the realistic behavior of equipment
in the power grid. Previous works on IoT attacks to the power
grid [28, 34] do not represent the delay characteristic of pro-
tection equipment, but rather use models that appear to be
based only on the immediate removal of an element after any
amount of overload. Such a model violates NERC criteria for
overload protection [1]. Our model is instead a discrete event
simulator that does not assume that all relays will trip at the
same time. In particular, we model equipment under stress,
such as current overloads of 50-100% of the line rating. This
model is based on the curves from manufacturers [2, 10] that
relate the overload of the device to the time until it trips—e.g.,
if the overload of the line increases signiﬁcantly, the trip time
would be much shorter.
Third, we also perform the ﬁrst large-scale transient anal-
ysis of MadIoT attacks on a real-world North American re-
gional system with over 5,000 buses. This large-scale analysis
shows that the most powerful MadIoT attacks can partition
the bulk power system into three or more isolated islands. The
power grid does not go into a system blackout, but each island
will be more vulnerable to future contingencies. This is a new
effect that has not been considered before.
Because by repeating the same attack conditions from pre-
vious work did not cause any blackout in our system, we
introduce new variations of the MadIoT attacks where for ex-
ample, the attacker systematically tries to create oscillations
of demand in order to drive the system into a more vulnerable
state before launching the second stage of the attack.
Finally, all our simulations are done in PowerWorld [4],
which is an industry-standard transient and AC steady-state
solver, as its basic building block, so the basic physics of the
system are represented with industry-accepted ﬁdelity.
These contributions are summarized in Table 1.
3 Cascading Outage Analyzer
This section summarizes our Cascading Outage Analyzer
(COA) tool. The COA model considers both steady-state
and transient stability analysis in different time scales but
coordinated so the transition of system stability from one
steady-state operating point to another is present. The basic
model checks for conditions that would trigger protective
relays, and assesses the time when relays will be triggered.

The framework of the COA is described in Figure 3. The
simulation has both transient and steady state parts. For each
contingency, a transient simulation is run using the Power-
World transient simulation tool. If the system reaches a stable
state, then simulation results are sent to the steady state simu-
lation as initial values, where an AC power ﬂow is run. Based
on the resulting line ﬂows and voltage magnitudes, the timing
for activating protection equipment is then computed.
If there are any new protection equipment activated from
this steady state simulation, the new outage will be mod-
eled and the next iteration of simulation will start using the
PowerWorld transient simulation tool. This multi-time scale
process continues until no outage occurs in both the transient
and steady-state parts of the simulation, or until the transient
simulation is unable to solve the problem, in which case an
“algorithmic non-convergence” is declared to have occurred
as a proxy to a system blackout.
We now describe how each of the four protection systems
we consider are modeled.
3.1 Protection of Generators
If a mismatch between generation and load occurs, there will
be a frequency deviation from the desired nominal value (if
there is more load than generation, the frequency of the sys-
tem will decrease, and if there is more generation than load,
the frequency of the system will increase). A big frequency
deviation may trigger generator under- and over frequency-
protections.
Transient stability or rotor angle stability is the ability of

3.3 Overcurrent Protection
Disconnecting transmission lines because of a thermal limit
violation is one of the most common events in cascading
outages [53]. We trigger overcurrent protections based on the
results from our steady-state results. The status and dispatch
set points of units at the end of the PowerWorld transient
analysis are used as starting points for the PowerWorld AC
power ﬂow simulator. An inverse-time overcurrent equation
described in the Siemens SIPRO-TEC 5 Current Relay [10]
is implemented in our model. The time when the over current
relay trips the element is determined by equation (1),
T =
( I
Ith
0.14
)0.02 − 1
Tp[s],
(1)
where Ith is the current threshold value of the relay, and Tp
is the setting value of the relay. Both values are set by the
relay operator. I is the current on the monitored component
such as a transmission line or a transformer. The value of T
in (1) determines when the protection will be activated. It
is important to understand that overloading the line past its
nominal rating does not immediately result in a transmission
outage. Simpliﬁed models that do not account for the detailed
behavior of protection equipment are likely to consider that a
line gets out of service when in reality it keeps operating (it
just sags). This is another of the reasons we obtain different
results from previous work.
3.4 Over/Under Voltage Protection
Another typical pattern associated with cascading outages
is an under (or over) voltage problem. When the system is
highly stressed, the voltage proﬁles of power systems may
decline. Even if the AC power ﬂow calculation converges, if
a bus voltage stays below the lower limit in our simulations,
a load-shedding protection mechanism will be triggered in
order to return the bus voltages to their limits [53].
The bus voltages are required to be on a range for the safe
operation of the connected generators. A generator may also
be disconnected if the voltage of the connected bus goes out
of limits for too long.
We implement in our simulator a standard inverse time
characteristic equation described in ABB RXEDK 2H time
over/under voltage relay [2] to ﬁnd the timing for the acti-
vation of voltage protection equipment. The time duration
until the under or over voltage relay trips is determined in
equations (2) and (3),

the power system to remain in synchronism when subjected
to large transient disturbances [37]. We choose to use time-
domain simulation because the time-domain simulation takes
into account the full system dynamic model and constantly
checks that inter-machine rotor angle deviations lie within a
speciﬁc range of values.
We use the PowerWorld transient stability solver to numer-
ically calculate the system response after a fault. If the rotor
angle deviation of a generator is bigger than a certain thresh-
old, e.g., 100 degrees, the generator will be automatically
tripped and removed from the power grid to prevent perma-
nent damages. The disconnection of the generator won’t be
immediate after crossing a threshold, but it will be dependent
on the amount of time that it remains in the unsafe region.
We will discuss the exact conﬁguration parameters for discon-
necting a generator later in the paper.
3.2 Preventing the Tripping of Generators
When the system loses a generator or when there is a sud-
den increase in the load, the frequency of the power grid
decreases rapidly. A countermeasure to prevent the activation
of (more) under-frequency generator protections is a mecha-
nism called Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS). The
predominant system condition addressed by IEEE C37.117
involves the use of protective relays for under frequency shed-
ding of connected load in the event of insufﬁcient generation
or transmission capacity within a power system. Therefore,
we include UFLS along with over/under frequency generator
tripping as frequency outage checkers in the COA model. Tak-
ing into consideration these protections embedded in power
systems is one of the reasons we obtain different results when
compared to previous work.

where k is the inverse time constant, Uth is the over/under
voltage relay pick-up value, and U is the user deﬁned relay
operating value. The values of T in equations (2) and (3) de-
termine when the protection will activate. As with the line
overload model, over/under voltages do not immediately re-
sult in a bus outage.
4 Considerations for Modeling the Impact of
IoT Attacks
This section will demonstrate the contribution of applying
our cascading outage analyzer in the study of IoT demand
attacks and in particular, this section will compare our results
with previous work in order to show why we obtain different
results. We will start our analysis with a relatively simple
but standard Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC)
model with 9 buses and 9 lines, as this is a model that has
been used in previous work. We will also discuss in more
detail some of our considerations for modeling the impact
of IoT attacks. In the next section we will provide a detailed
study on a model of a real-world North American system.
In this section we use the over/under frequency generation
protection and Under-frequency load shedding parameters
from Table 2 and Table 3. In the next section we will explain
in more detail these parameters.
4.1 The Need for Combining Transient and
Steady-State Simulations
Since the operation of a power system after a disturbance
is a continuous process over a long time frame, a closed-
loop structure of the cascading outage analyzer can better
approximate the operations of the power system over various
time scales after a disturbance. As previously discussed, the
results and states of the system after the transient simulation
are stored and set as the starting point of the steady-state
simulations. The cascading outage generated from steady
state simulations, if there is any, is then used as the initial
condition in the transient simulation for the next loop.
Previous work considered transient and steady-state sim-
ulations as separate, and as a result, the transient impacts
on generators and system frequencies are not present in the
power ﬂow simulations. Therefore the predictions of cascad-
ing outages can differ when compared to our work. Let us
look at an example to see a possible inconsistency, while em-
phasizing the importance of a combined transient/steady-state
simulation for the analysis of cascading outages caused by
IoT demand attacks.
Figure 4 shows the WSCC 9-bus system considered by
Soltan et al. [47]. Consider an IoT demand attack that in-
creases all loads by 15% in the system. Now let us see what
happens if a transmission line is removed if the power ﬂow
is over its rated capacity [20]. If the transient impacts of this

attack are not considered, the results from the steady-state
power ﬂow would indicate a line outage between bus 7 and
bus 8, as highlighted with a red circle (shows the percentage
of the rated capacity) in the top left corner in Figure 5.
Figure 5: Power ﬂow results of 15% of load increase.
However, because of the sudden load increase caused by
the MadIoT attack, load and generation are not balanced and
