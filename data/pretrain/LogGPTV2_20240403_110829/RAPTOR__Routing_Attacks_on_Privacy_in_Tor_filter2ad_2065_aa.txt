### Abstract
The Tor network is a widely used system for anonymous communication. However, it is known to be vulnerable to adversaries who can observe traffic at both ends of the communication path. In this paper, we introduce a suite of new attacks, called RAPTOR, which Autonomous Systems (ASes) can use to compromise user anonymity. 

First, AS-level adversaries can exploit the asymmetric nature of Internet routing to increase the likelihood of observing at least one direction of user traffic at both ends of the communication. Second, AS-level adversaries can leverage natural churn in Internet routing to lie on BGP paths for more users over time. Third, strategic adversaries can manipulate Internet routing via BGP hijacks and interceptions to discover and analyze specific Tor guard nodes.

We demonstrate the feasibility of RAPTOR attacks by analyzing historical BGP data and Traceroute data, and by performing real-world attacks on the live Tor network without harming real users. Additionally, we outline the design of two monitoring frameworks to counter these attacks: BGP monitoring to detect control-plane attacks and Traceroute monitoring to detect data-plane anomalies. Our work highlights the need for anonymity systems that are aware of the dynamics of Internet routing.

## 1. Introduction
Anonymity systems aim to protect user identities from untrusted destinations and third parties on the Internet. The Tor network is the most widely used among these systems, comprising 7,000 relays or proxies that carry terabytes of traffic daily. Tor serves millions of users, including political dissidents, whistleblowers, law enforcement, intelligence agencies, journalists, businesses, and ordinary citizens concerned about their online privacy.

While Tor provides low latency, it does not obfuscate packet timings or sizes. An adversary who can observe traffic on both segments of the Tor communication channel (i.e., between the server and the Tor network, and between the Tor network and the client) can correlate packet sizes and timings to deanonymize Tor clients.

Adversaries can gain visibility into Tor traffic either by compromising Tor relays or by manipulating the underlying network communications to place themselves on the forwarding path. Large Autonomous Systems (ASes), such as Internet Service Providers (ISPs), can easily eavesdrop on links and observe unencrypted information, packet headers, timing, and size. Recent revelations by Edward Snowden confirm that ASes pose a real threat, with programs like the NSA's Marina and GCHQ's Tempora storing metadata for extended periods.

In this paper, we present RAPTOR, a suite of novel traffic analysis attacks that deanonymize Tor users more effectively than previously thought possible. Unlike previous studies, RAPTOR leverages the dynamic aspects of the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).

### Table 1: RAPTOR Attacks Overview
| Attack Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Traffic Analysis | Exploits asymmetric routing to increase the chance of observing traffic at both ends. |
| BGP Churn | Leverages natural changes in BGP paths to observe additional Tor traffic over time. |
| BGP Hijack | Manipulates BGP to intercept and analyze traffic to specific Tor guard nodes. |
| BGP Interception | Actively intercepts and analyzes traffic to specific Tor guard nodes. |

## 2. RAPTOR Attacks
To communicate, Tor clients establish layered circuits through three subsequent Tor relays: an entry (or guard) relay, a middle relay, and an exit relay. Encryption ensures that each relay learns only the identity of the previous and next hop, preventing any single relay from linking the client to the destination server.

### 2.1 Asymmetric Traffic Analysis
We propose asymmetric traffic analysis, a new form of end-to-end timing analysis. If an attacker can observe traffic from the destination server to the exit relay and from the entry relay to the client (or vice versa), they can use correlation between packet timing and sizes to infer the identities of clients and servers. This works even if the communication is encrypted.

Asymmetric routing increases the number of ASes that can compromise anonymity. For example, if the path from the exit relay to the Web server is different from the path from the Web server to the exit relay, an adversary may observe TCP acknowledgment traffic on the reverse path. Our attack inspects TCP headers to retrieve sequence and acknowledgment numbers, correlating these fields over time. Experimental results show a 95% detection accuracy.

### 2.2 Natural Churn
BGP churn, or natural changes in BGP paths, can increase the number of ASes that can deanonymize Tor traffic over time. For instance, if a link fails, a new AS may be added to the path, allowing it to perform traffic analysis. Our analysis shows that the surveillance capability of an AS-level adversary can increase by up to 50% over a month.

### 2.3 BGP Hijack
Strategic AS-level adversaries can launch active attacks, such as BGP hijacks, to manipulate inter-domain routing. By advertising incorrect BGP control messages, an AS can capture a fraction of Internet traffic destined for a specific prefix. Tor guard relays, which observe a large amount of client traffic, are attractive targets for BGP hijacks.

For example, an AS-level adversary aiming to deanonymize a user connected to a sensitive Web server can first uncover the identity of the client’s guard relay using existing attacks. Then, the adversary can launch a BGP hijack against the guard relay, allowing them to see traffic destined for the guard and learn the set of all client IP addresses.

## 3. Countermeasures
We present a comprehensive taxonomy of countermeasures against RAPTOR attacks, including a monitoring framework for the Tor network. This framework aims to detect suspicious AS-level path changes towards Tor prefixes using both BGP and Traceroute monitoring.

## Conclusion
Our work demonstrates the feasibility of RAPTOR attacks and the need for robust countermeasures. We motivate the design of anonymity systems that account for the dynamics of Internet routing.
