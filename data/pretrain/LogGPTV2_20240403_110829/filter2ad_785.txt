Abstract— In this paper, we explore the eﬃcacy of curb-
side acoustic sensing to estimate road traﬃc conditions. We
formulated a set of hypotheses which attempted to correlate
traﬃc conditions with the ambient traﬃc noise. We present
the evaluation of our hypotheses under various traﬃc condi-
tions. Our threshold-based-classiﬁcation yields 70-90% ac-
curacy in distinguishing congested from free-ﬂowing traﬃc.

INTRODUCTION
Rapid urbanization and increase in number of automo-
biles (two, three and four wheelers) are characteristics of
developing countries like India. Coupled with adverse road
conditions, driving behavior and lack of lane discipline, sev-
eral cities experience severe traﬃc congestion. In such con-
ditions, a traﬃc estimation system can be a valuable tool,
both for road users and infrastructure planners. Knowledge
of current and historical/typical traﬃc conditions can help
users plan travel routes and governing bodies to better man-
age traﬃc and in planning for new infrastructure. Traﬃc
monitoring systems used in the developed world are normally
deployed on freeways and intersections, assume structured
traﬃc and explicitly count vehicles[2][4]. These systems will
most likely fail when applied to the Indian scenario, primar-
ily due to lack of lane discipline[1][3].
The problem we address is estimation of road traﬃc condi-
tion in near real-time. Our quest is challenging because we
want the estimation system to be minimally intrusive and
low-cost. We envision a system where inexpensive, wireless-
enabled, curb-side sensors are deployed widely, to collect am-
bient traﬃc-related data. A temporal-spatial collection of
these signals will be analyzed and for traﬃc-state updates,
to be sent to road users. The focus of this paper is on the
sensing and signal processing aspects.

The intuition is as follows, diﬀerent traﬃc states generate
diﬀerent kinds/levels of ambient noise/acoustic signals. The
source and magnitude of noise can vary greatly depending
on the kind of traﬃc scene, e.g., slow & congested traﬃc
will probably have high magnitude signals originating from
brakes, honks and engines. Accelerating traﬃc generates
louder noise than freely ﬂowing or static traﬃcs, owing to the
roaring engine. Empty-traﬃc will only consist of background
noise from the environment. We aim to capture these diﬀer-
ences in the acoustic signals and use them as signatures to
classify traﬃc conditions. A plausible assumption we make
is that as the density of the traﬃc increases, the average
speed of the traﬃc reduces. Speciﬁcally, we aim to classify
traﬃc into the following categories, (i) slow & congested, (ii)
static, (iii) fast and (iv) empty. By slow-moving, we mean
that there is frequent braking and bursty acceleration due
to stop-and-go motion. The hypotheses based on which we
come up with the above categorization are:
1. Accelerating or slow-moving traﬃc is the loudest. This
is due to frequent braking, honking and engine stress
due to bursty acceleration.
2. The composition of acoustic signal (power) levels over
the frequency spectrum is diﬀerent for diﬀerent traﬃc
states.
2. OUR APPROACH
3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
The central idea of our approach is to determine traﬃc
state as a whole rather than explicitly count or classify each
vehicle. The solution aims to collect traﬃc-related param-
eters and analyze them to classify traﬃc as slow-moving &
congested, or fast , or static or empty. The requirement of
such a system is the availability of a sensing component that
can give us relevant information. As a ﬁrst step, we explore
the eﬃcacy of using acoustic sensors for traﬃc estimation.

The objective of our measurement and analysis is to assess
the capabilities and limitations of our hypotheses. Figure 1
shows our in-situ sensing setup– an omni-directional external
microphone placed on the curb-side at a height of 1-2 feet
connected to a laptop (for collecting logs). We deployed,
collected acoustic signal logs, video-taped traﬃc for ground
truth and analyzed these logs, at several physical locations
(corresponding to diﬀerent traﬃc scenarios and road char-
acteristics). The setup also shows a set of magnetic sensors,
which we plan to use as part of our future work.
In a deployment on a four-laned road which often expe-
riences congestion during peak hours(Deployment #1), we
431road deployment (Deployment #2) outside the college cam-
pus. The road is two-laned on each side and often experi-
ences high-density congested traﬃc during peak hours. Note
that the x-axis is in log scale. As seen from the ﬁgure, fre-
quencies below 5000 Hz contribute 95% of the total mag-
nitude for both fast and static traﬃc, and 80% for slow-
moving traﬃc. With slow traﬃc, 95% of total amplitude is
contributed by frequencies below 15 KHz. Slow traﬃc at
this location is a result of frequent braking and bursty ac-
celeration due to stop-and-go motion. Fast and static traf-
ﬁcs, do not suﬀer from these eﬀects and appear similar in
the frequency-amplitude proﬁle. This diﬀerence in contri-
butions can classify slow-moving traﬃc from fast and static
traﬃcs. Note that this inference is diﬀerent from the one
we hinted at using Deployment #1 (using average ampli-
tude of top-k frequencies).
In that case, we were able to
distinguish congested(slow-moving and static traﬃc) from
free-ﬂowing(fast and empty) conditions. Further, here, the
average magnitude of slow-moving traﬃc was only 10 dB
higher than that of empty-traﬃc, making it diﬃcult to use
the top-k approach for traﬃc classiﬁcation. Upon testing the
95%-5kHz threshold for CDF, we achieved 74% accuracy in
classifying fast and slow traﬃcs.
We repeated the above data collection and analysis pro-
cess at diﬀerent locations experiencing both congested and
free-ﬂowing traﬃc at diﬀerent times of the day. In several
cases, the CDF approach did not yield distinguishable fea-
tures while the approach of using the average magnitude
of the top-k frequencies for classiﬁcation seemed promising.
For example, the CDF of traﬃc in Deployment #1 has con-
sistent contribution by the entire frequency spectrum for all
kinds of traﬃc.
4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
As part of this work, we assessed the eﬃcacy of using
curb-side acoustic sensing for traﬃc estimation. We formu-
lated a set of hypotheses which attempted to correlate traﬃc
conditions with the ambient traﬃc noise. We presented the
evaluation of our hypotheses under various traﬃc conditions.
Through our analysis we determined that ambient acoustic
sensing is selectively applicable for traﬃc estimation.
As part of future work, we can incorporate sophisticated
learning and classiﬁcation algorithms applied to acoustic sig-
nals[5] for traﬃc classiﬁcation. Also, we intend to incorpo-
rate multi-modal sensing into our approach in the future.
Previous studies were able to show correlation between traf-
ﬁc state/density and magnetic sensors readings, hinted at
classifying moving and static traﬃc reliably. Currently, we
are analyzing multi-modal acoustic and magnetic sensor data
towards distinguishing traﬃc state under all conditions.

recorded 1 hour of ambient traﬃc noise and manually clipped
out static, accelerating, slow-moving and fast-moving traf-
ﬁc segments. Each such clip was 4-5 seconds long. We
wanted to study if we could correctly classify traﬃc states
for such time segments. We convert each clip from the time
domain to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Trans-
form (FFT), which decomposes the signal into its frequency
components. Further, we calculate average amplitude over
a frequency width of 100 Hz and use it as the magnitude for
that bin.
For each instance of a traﬃc type, we calculated the com-
bined average amplitude of top-k frequencies (frequencies
corresponding to k highest amplitudes). The intuition is to
test whether the magnitude of acoustic signal (power) over
top-k frequency components is distinct for diﬀerent traﬃc
patterns. Figure 2 depicts this relation. As can been seen,
there is at least 20 dB diﬀerence between congested(slow-
moving, static) and freely ﬂowing(fast, empty) traﬃc pat-
terns. Further, the power level in the top-5 and top-50 fre-
quencies diﬀers by 2 dB, and implies no additional gain from
considering additional frequencies. Based on this, an initial
inference is that magnitude of top-k frequencies is indica-
tive of traﬃc pattern. In this case, a threshold which lies
between the 20 dB diﬀerence can separate congested traﬃc
from non-congested. To test our ﬁndings, we chose unseen
data from the same deployment. With a -60 dB threshold
to seperate fast from slow-moving traﬃc, we achieved 92%
accuracy.
Next, we analyzed the contribution of all the frequency
components of the signal. Based on the magnitudes asso-
ciated with each frequency, we plotted a CDF of the en-
tire frequency spectrum. The intuition is as follows, slow-
moving/heavy traﬃc predominantly generates high frequency
noise, while static-traﬃc has contributions from the lower
frequency spectrum owing to idle engine noise. A CDF can
be used to analyze whether this is indeed the case.
