User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Linux no space left on device issue We have SUSE Linux OS:

$ uname -a
Linux 3.0.13-0.27-default #1 SMP Wed Feb 15 13:33:49 UTC 2012  x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux


Only for a specific file the file creation fails with error no space left on device. We are able to create other files, what has gone wrong?
In the current scenario:


Inode usage is only 47%

$ df -i .
Filesystem               Inodes    IUsed    IFree IUse% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/appvg-dsfs 39321600 18218000 21103600   47% /dsfs

Disk usage is only 82%

$ df -h .
Filesystem              Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/mapper/appvg-dsfs  591G  457G  105G  82% /dsfs

File creation of one specific file fails in this case JDE_GL_INCR_STG_201504_181.log.load.058

$ echo "a" &gt; JDE_GL_INCR_STG_201504_181.log.load.058
-bash: JDE_GL_INCR_STG_201504_181.log.load.058: No space left on device
echo "a" &gt; testfile

$ mv JDE_GL_INCR_STG_201504_181.log.load.058 tempfile
mv: cannot stat `JDE_GL_INCR_STG_201504_181.log.load.058': No such file or directory

File creation of other files is possible

Assistant: Maybe you run out of Semaphores. Try this as root

ipcs -s


and check if there are a lot of semaphores owned by the same user.  If so run the following command

ipcs -s |grep username |awk '{print $2}'


in the above command replace the username withn the actual user.
