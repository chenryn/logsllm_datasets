capacitor.    This  typically  consists  of  the  underlying 
semiconductor serving as one plate, separated from the 
other polysilicon plate by a thin oxide film.  This fairly 
straightforward  two-dimensional  cell  capacitor  was 
used in planar DRAM cells covering the range from 16 
kb to 1 Mb  cells, and placed the  capacitor next to the 
transistor, occupying about a third of the total cell area.  
Although  some  gains  in  capacitance  (leading  to  a 
shrinking  of  cell  area)  could  be  made  by  thinning  the 
oxide  thickness  separating  the  capacitor  plates,  for 
newer cells it was necessary to move from the 2D plate

Newer  DRAM  cells  of  16  Mb  and  higher  capacity 
moved  from  a  menagerie  of  trench  capacitor  types  to 
stacked capacitor cells (STCs), which stack the storage 
capacitor  above  the transistor rather than  burying  it in 
the  silicon  underneath.    STCs  used  varying  types  of 
horizontal or vertical fins to further increase the surface 
area, and thus the capacitance.  The cell at the right of

possible  to  analyse  and  recover  data  from  these  cells 
and from semiconductor devices in general long after it 
should  (in  theory)  have  vanished.    To  see  how  this  is 
possible,  we  need 
level  of 
semiconductor device physics.  Recall the discussion of 
(theoretical)  electron/hole  flow,  in  which  electrons  or 
holes move freely through a semiconductor lattice.  In 
practice it isn’t nearly this simple, since the lattice will 
contain  impurities,  atoms  missing  from  the  lattice 
(vacancies), and extra atoms in the lattice (interstitials).  
In  addition,  the  atoms  in  the  lattice  will  be  vibrating 
slightly,  producing  phonons which  work like  electrons 
but  carry  momentum  and  can  affect  electrons  if  they 
collide with them. 
If  perchance 
to  free 
hole/electron movement don’t take effect, or because of 
other  factors  such  as  high  temperatures  or  voltages, 
electrons can build up quite a bit of momentum, which 
can  be  transferred  to  atoms  in  the  lattice  during 
collisions.   In  some  cases  this  is  enough  to  physically 
move  the  atom  to  new  locations,  a  process  known  as 
electromigration.

4.1. Electromigration 
Electromigration involves the relocation of metal atoms 
due  to  high  current  densities,  a  phenomenon in  which 
atoms  are  carried  along  by  an  “electron  wind”  in  the 
opposite  direction  to  the  conventional  current  flow, 
producing  voids  at  the  negative  electrode  and  hillocks 
and  whiskers  at  the  positive  electrode  (if  there’s  a 
passivation layer present the excess matter extrudes out 
to form a whisker, if not it distributes itself to minimise 
total surface area and forms a hillock).  Void formation 
leads  to  a  local  increase  in  current  density  and  Joule 
heating  (the  interaction  of  electrons  and  metal  ions  to 
produce 
further 
electromigration  effects.    When  the  external  stress  is 
removed, the disturbed system tends to relax back to its 
original equilibrium state, resulting in a backflow which 
heals some of the electromigration damage.  In the long 
term though this can cause device failure (the excavated 
voids lead to open circuits, the grown whiskers to short 
circuits), but in less extreme cases simply serves to alter 
a device’s operating characteristics in noticeable ways.  
For example the excavations of voids leads to increased 
wiring  resistance,  and  the  growth of whiskers leads to 
contact formation and current leakage.  An example of 
a  conductor  which  exhibits  whisker  growth  due  to 
electromigration  is  shown  in  Figure  7,  and  one  which 
exhibits  void  formation (in this  case  severe  enough  to 
have  lead  to  complete  failure)  is  shown  in  Figure  8.  
Electromigration  is  a  complex  topic,  an  excellent 
introduction  to  the  subject  is  contained  in  the  survey 
paper by Lloyd [8].

In order to reduce electromigration effects which occur 
in pure metals, interconnects are typically alloys (a few 
percent  copper  in  aluminium  interconnects,  a  few 
percent 
interconnects)  which  have 
electromigration characteristics of their own in that the 
Cu  or  Sn  solute  atoms  are  displaced  by  the  electron 
wind  until  the  source  region  becomes  depleted  and 
behaves like the original pure metal.  This initial level 
of  electromigration  effect,  which  doesn’t  affect  circuit 
operation  and  isn’t  directly  visible,  can  be  detected 
using  electron  microprobe  techniques  which  measure 
the  distribution  of  the  Cu  or  Sn  along  the  base  metal 
line [9].

electromigration 
Although  recent  trends  in  clock  speeds  and  device 
feature  size  reduction  are  resulting  in  devices  with 
characteristics such as thin, sub-1.0μm lines, short sub-
50-100μm 
lengths,  and  utilisation  of  high 
frequencies  which  have  traditionally  been  regarded  as 
line 
electromigration-resistant [10][11], they merely provide 
an  ameliorative  effect  which  is  balanced  by  other  (in 
some  cases  yet-to-be-understood)  electromigration 
phenomena  which  occur  as  device  dimensions  shrink.  
Even  the  move  to  copper  interconnects is  no  panacea, 
since  although  the  actual  copper  electromigration 
mechanisms differ somewhat from those in aluminium, 
the problem still occurs [9][12][13]. 
4.2. Hot Carriers 
High-energy  electrons  can  cause  other  problems  as 
well.    A  very  obvious  one  is  that  the  device  heats  up 
during operation because of collisions with the atoms in 
the  lattice,  at least  one  effect  of  the  heating  being  the 
generation of further high-speed electrons.  A problem 
which  is  particularly  acute  in  MOSFETs  with  very 
small  device  dimensions  is  that  of  hot  carriers  which 
are accelerated to a high energy due to the large electric 
fields  which  occur  as  device  dimensions  are  reduced 
(hot-carrier effects in newer high-density DRAMs have 
become so problematic that the devices contain internal 
voltage  converters  to  reduce  the  external  3.3  or  5V 
supply by one or two volts to help combat this problem, 
and the most recent ones use a supply voltage of 2.5V 
for  similar  reasons).    In  extreme  cases  these  hot 
electrons  can  overcome  the  Si-SiO2  potential  barrier 
and be accelerated into the gate oxide and stay there as 
excess  charge  [14].    The  detrapping  time  for  the 
resulting trapped charge can range from nanoseconds to 
days  [15],  although  if  the  charge  makes  it  into  the 
silicon  nitride  passivation  layer  it’s  effectively  there 
permanently  (one  study  estimated  a  lifetime  in  excess 
of 30 years at 150°C) [16]. 
This  excess  charge  changes  the  characteristics  of  the 
device  over  time,  reducing  the  on-state  current  in  n-
MOSFETs  and  increasing  the  off-state  current  in  p-
MOSFETs [17][18][19].  The change in characteristics 
produces  a  variety  of  measurable  effects,  for  example 
one study found a change of several hundred millivolts 
in  memory  cell  signal  voltage  over  a  period  of  a  few 
minutes [20].  This effect is most marked when a 1 bit 
is  written  after  a  0  bit  has  been  repeatedly  read  or 
written  from  the  cell,  leading  to  a  drop  in  the  cell 
threshold  voltage.    Writing  a  0  over  a  1  leads  to  an 
increase  in  the  cell  voltage.    One  way  to  detect  these 
voltage  shifts  is  to  adjust  the  settings  of  the  reference 
cell in the sense amplifier so that instead of being set to 
a  median  value  appropriate  for  determining  whether  a 
stored  value  represents  a  0  or  a  1,  it  can  be  used  to 
obtain a precise measurement of the actual voltage from 
the cell. 
Hot-carrier  stressing  of  cells  can  also  affect  other  cell 
parameters such as the cell’s access and refresh times.  
For  example  the  precharge  time  (the  time  in  which  it 
is 
takes to set the DRAM data lines to their preset values 
before  an  access) 
increased  by  hot-carrier 
degradation,  although  the  specific  case  of  precharge 
time  change  affects  only  older  NMOS  cells  and  not 
newer  CMOS  ones.    In  addition  hot  carriers  can 
produce  visible  or  near-infrared  photon  emission  in 
saturated  FETs  [21][22],  but  use  of  this  phenomenon 
would  require  that  an  attacker  be  physically  present 
while the device is being operated. 
Hot carrier effects occur in logic circuits in general and 
not  just  in  RAM  cells.    When  MOS  transistors  are 
employed  in  digital  logic,  the  logic  steady  states  are 
regions of low stress because there is either a high field 
near the drain but the gate is low and the channel is off, 
or the electric field near the drain is low, in both cases 
leading  to  no  generation  of  hot  carriers.    Hot  carriers 
are  generated  almost  exclusively  during  switching 
transitions  [23][24].    The  effects  of  the  hot-carrier 
stressing can  be  determined by measuring  a  variety of 
device  parameters, 
currents, 
voltages, and capacitances for the device [25].

4.3. Ionic Contamination 
The  most  common  ionic  contamination  present  in 
semiconductors arises from the sodium (and to a lesser 
extent potassium) ions present in materials used during 
the  semiconductor  manufacturing  and  packaging 
process,  a  typical  ion  count  being  1010/cm2.    This 
contamination  was  originally  thought  to  arise  from 
sodium  diffusion  from  the  furnace  tube  [26]  but  with 
current  manufacturing  processes  comes  about  because 
of  impurities  in  the  metallisation  layers  contaminating 
the silicon beneath.  The problem is generally addressed 
through the standard application of passivation layers to 
protect the silicon [27].  Sodium ions have a fairly high 
mobility  in  silicon  dioxide,  and  in  the  presence  of  an 
electric  field  or  elevated  temperatures  will  migrate 
towards  the  silicon/silicon  dioxide  interface  in  the 
device,  reducing  the  threshold  voltage  of  n-channel 
devices  and  increasing  it  for  p-channel  devices  [28], 
again producing  results which are detectable  using the 
techniques described for hot-carrier effect detection. 
There  has  been  almost  no  work  done  in  this  area, 
probably because it isn’t a significant enough problem 
to affect normal device  operation, although  one of the 
few works in this area indicate that it would take many 
minutes  to  hours  of  stress  at  standard  operating 
temperatures  (50-100°C)  to  produce  any  noticeable 
effect [26].  In addition it’s unlikely that the effects of 
sodium contamination in current devices will be useful 
in recovering data from them, since reliability studies of 
devices  indicate  that  contamination  occurs  only  in 
randomly-distributed  locations  where  impurities  have 
penetrated the passivation layer through microfractures 
or pinholes [29].  Finally, the combination of improved 
manufacturing and passivation processes and shrinking 
device dimensions (which reduce the effects of mobile 
ions on the device) render this an area which is unlikely 
to bear much fruit. 
Halide ions are another type of contaminant which may 
be  introduced  during  the  manufacturing  process  (in 
some  cases  deliberately  as  a  semiconductor  dopant), 
however  these  only  lead  to  general  corrosion  of  the 
device  rather  than  producing  any  effects  useful  for 
recovering  data  from  it  (yet  another  reason  why 
passivation layers are used is to provide some level of 
protection  against  this  type  of  contamination  and  its 
attendant side-effects).

4.4. Other Effects 
The  storage  capacitor  in a DRAM  cell typically needs 
to  store  250-300  fC  of  charge.    As  has  already  been 
mentioned,  earlier  planar  cells  were  scaled  down  by 
reducing  the  oxide  thickness  in  the  planar  capacitor, 
while  newer  cells  have  gone  to  3D  structures  such  as 
trench  and  stacked  capacitors.    Trench  capacitors 
typically  used  silicon  dioxide  (often  referred  to  as 
ONO)  insulators,  while  STCs  have  gone  to  using 
silicon  nitride  films  which  have  a  higher  dielectric 
constant and allow thinner films to be used (as usual, a 
variety of other exotic technologies are also in use).  In 
both cases parameters such as leakage current and time-
dependant dielectric  breakdown  (TDDB) are  relatively 
static  and  can’t  be  used  for  stored  data  recovery 
purposes. 
Radiation can also affect the operation of a RAM cell, 
for 
a 
MOSFET’s gate oxide  can alter the turn-on voltage of 
the  device,  with  the  oxide-trapped  charge  shifting  the 
required turn-on voltage at the  gate  downwards  for an 
n-channel MOSFET, effectively making it easier to turn 
on.    p-channel  MOSFETs,  because  of  their  slightly 
different  mode  of  operation,  are  more  resistant  to 
radiation,  but  when  affected  become  more  difficult  to 
turn  off.    Radiation  can  therefore  alter  memory  cell 
parameters  such  as  voltage  level  thresholds,  timings, 
and  power  supply  and  leakage  currents.    As  with 
DRAM  capacitor  effects  this  provides  little  practical
