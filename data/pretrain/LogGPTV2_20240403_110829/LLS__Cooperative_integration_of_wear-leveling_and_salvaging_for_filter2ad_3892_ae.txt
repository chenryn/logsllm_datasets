### Bit Operations for Address Translation

#### Overview
This section discusses the bit operations and masks used to facilitate address translation in Phase Change Memory (PCM) systems. The goal is to map device addresses to their corresponding salvaging groups, which include group IDs and offsets.

#### Mapping and Masks
1. **Device Address Mapping**:
   - **Figure 13(a)** illustrates the mapping from a PCM device address to its salvaging group, including the group ID and offset.
   - **A-Mask and B-Mask**: These masks are generated to assist in the logic selection process.

2. **A-Mask Generation**:
   - Given \( X = 465 \), bits 0 to 465 of A-Mask are set, indicating that the broken line rank only counts the '1's in these positions.
   - Example: 
     - A-Mask: `11111111...` (bits 0 to 465 set)
     - Broken line rank: Counts the '1's in the specified positions.

3. **B-Mask Generation**:
   - B-Mask is generated from \( R_{loc} \) to differentiate between main PCM and backup spaces.
   - Given \( R_{loc} = 492 \), the last \( 5 \times 4 = 20 \) bits of the B-Mask are set.
   - Example:
     - B-Mask: `...11111111111111111111` (last 20 bits set)

#### Address Translation Process
1. **Fetch and Filter**:
   - For an address \( x \), fetch the bit vector for its group using A-Mask.
   - Filter the result to get the relevant bits.

2. **Subgroup Division**:
   - Divide the 512 bits into 32 subgroups of 16 bits each.
   - Use a 16-bit population counter to count the number of '1's in each subgroup.

3. **Population Counting**:
   - Ramanarayanan et al. [22] proposed a 3:2 compressor structure to implement a 64-bit population counter in a single cycle on a 2.1GHz low-power CPU using 65nm technology.
   - The 32 5-bit results are summarized using a Wallace-tree structure to get the broken line rank \( Y \).

4. **Hardware Optimization**:
   - Due to space constraints, details of the 3:2 compressor and Wallace-tree logic in the second and third steps are omitted.
   - Step 2 can be skipped if the backup PCM contains fewer than 5 chunks (only one group exists).
   - The population counting logic is reused to reduce hardware cost.

#### Custom Design
- A custom design of the proposed logic was done using PTM 45nm technology, requiring 55K transistors and 13KfLmÂ² die area.
- Total latency: 2.68ns (0.98ns + 1.24ns + 0.46ns).

#### Performance and Lifetime
- **Figure 14** compares the performance of ECP, L-ECP, and LLS.
- **Figure 15** shows the lifetime comparison of different grouping choices.
- L-ECP extends the lifetime by 10-20% with minimal overhead, while LLS achieves about 8% extra lifetime beyond L-ECP.

#### Energy Consumption
- The energy overhead comes from additional accesses to the reserved memory space.
- The translation logic consumes <0.1 nJ per access.
- A cache line contains 512 bits, and the read/write access and address translation energy consumption is a modest 2% of the total energy.

#### Sensitivity Analysis
- To study the sensitivity in forming salvaging groups, different numbers of chunks were chosen.
- 128 chunks with 4 lines per chunk provide a better trade-off between lifetime and overhead.

#### Conclusion
- LLS, a line-level salvaging scheme, integrates state-of-the-art wear leveling and low-level salvaging techniques.
- It helps extend PCM lifetime with modest hardware and performance overhead.
