User: How to configure scheduled or incremental backup of the file system on the Ubuntu system.
Assistant: On Ubuntu systems, you can use the rsync tool for file system backups or incremental backups. 1. Install rsync: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install rsync 2. Create a backup folder (assumed to be /home/user/backup/): sudo mkdir /home/user/backup/ 3. Create a backup script (assumed For /home/user/backup_script.sh): #!/bin/bash rsync -av --delete /source/folder/ /home/user/backup/ 4. Add executable permissions to the backup script: sudo chmod +x / home/user/backup_script.sh 5. Configure scheduled backup: Use the crontab command to edit the scheduled task: crontab -e Add the following content to the opened file: #Backup every day at 2 am 0 2 * * * /home/user/backup_script After saving and closing the .sh file, cron will start the backup script every day at 2am. Note: If you want to perform an incremental backup, you need to add the --link-dest parameter to the backup script and specify the directory of the last backup, for example: #!/bin/bash rsync -av --delete --link-dest=/ home/user/backup/2020-05-01 /source/folder/ /home/user/backup/2020-05-02 where /home/user/backup/2020-05-01 is the last backup folder, /home/user/backup/2020-05-02 is the target folder for this backup. In this way, only newly added or modified files will be copied to the current backup target folder during backup, which greatly saves backup time and storage space.
