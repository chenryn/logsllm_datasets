Fig. 14. Detect the PPT attack by analyzing the cache set distributions of
accesses and evictions. The x-axis denotes the cache set index while the y-
axis denotes simulation time measured in LLC accesses. The height and color
of each data point denotes its value. One distribution is sampled every 16K
LLC accesses. The standardization in (c) and (d) is done using the Z-Score
method [55], [56].
the distribution of LLC accesses and evictions over all cache
sets. Both distributions seem totally random. However, if we
apply a Z-Score [55] standardization on the distributions,
we can see two clear peaks in the standardized eviction
distribution (Fig. 14d), although it is still random for the
standardized access distribution (Fig. 14c). The two peaks
appear only in the test phase of the PPT algorithm and would
not show up in normal applications. After the prune phase, all
blocks in the prime set are simultaneously cached in the LLC.
If there is any eviction in the test phase, it must occur on the
target cache set. As a result, the score of the target cache set
reaches the maximum (32 for a 1024-set LLC) while it is zero
on all other sets.
The GE algorithm presents a similar pattern as demonstrated
by Fig. 15. Scores are small and randomly distributed at the
early stage of the two simulated attacks but converge on a
single cache set when the large eviction set is ﬁnally condensed
into a minimal one.
Since PPT spends less time on testing the prime set than
GE on trimming the eviction set, PPT is harder to detect than
GE. We thus ﬁnalize our detector against PPT and it should
work on GE as well. We start from a non-centered variant of

where ei is the number of evictions on cache set i and zi is the
calculated score for cache set i. The score of the target cache
set approaches to the maximum of √S in an ideal attack.
However, reporting an attack whenever a maximum score is
detected leads to false positive errors. When the LLC miss
rate is extremely low during normal operation, there might
be only one eviction during the whole sample period, which
also results in a maximum score. To avoid such errors, we
introduce the number of evictions into Equation 4 as weight:

where wzi is the weighted score. Since an eviction set requires
at least W addresses, the weighted score of the target cache
set approaches to W · √S during the test phase of an ideal
simply set to W ·√S. She can hide her trace by spreading the
An attacker can avoid detection if the detection threshold is
test phase over multiple sample periods. In the extreme case,
the attacker can collect only one congruent address in each
round of PPT attack, which effectively caps the weighted score
to √S.8 To detect such behavior and improve the robustness
of the detector, we apply an exponential moving average
(EMA) [57], [58] on the weighted score:
azi(t) = (1 − α) · azi(t − 1) + α · wzi(t)
(6)
where α is a discount factor used to calculate azi(t), the EMA
of wzi at sample t. The use of EMA allows the detector to
examine the history of wz because az is an inﬁnite impulse
response of wz. For normal applications, wz should be a zero-
centered small number for all cache sets, but unavoidably

test phase of PPT. By using a small α, the az of the target
cache set effectively accumulates the large wz over the history,
which makes it sufﬁciently signiﬁcant for detection. We set the
discount factor α to 1
32 by a heuristic analysis.
When the az of a certain cache set reaches a threshold
(az ≥ th), the detector triggers a remap. The value of th

triggered due to the accumulation of LLC evictions.
