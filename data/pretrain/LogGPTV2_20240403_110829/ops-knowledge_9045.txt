User: New to programming and python altogether. In the book I'm learning from, the author suggested I find out the purpose of Pydoc.
I did a google search on it, and found a match (from Gnome Terminal) but it didn't make much sense to me. Anyone mind simplifying a bit?
Assistant: Pydoc is the documentation generation system for Python. Say you can document your functions using the Pydoc standard and then it can be used to generate documentation in your code.
