security label for IoT devices. Additional user tests should
explore how consumers use the label in context as well as
identify areas where wording or design can be further improved.
Finally, we plan to develop a glossary of terms for consumers
and an implementation guide for device manufacturers with
detailed deﬁnitions of each factor and its possible values. The
latest version of the label and implementation information,
as well as a tool for generating the label are available at
www.iotsecurityprivacy.org.
