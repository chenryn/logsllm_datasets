The encoding/json package marshals RawMessage properly or incorrectly as
base64 based on whether its container is marshaled by value or as a pointer,
which is extremely subtle and trivial to get wrong silently.
It also consistently fails to marshal the RawMessage value properly when used
as a map value type.
Sample code demonstrating these problems:
