The `encoding/json` package in Go handles the marshaling of `RawMessage` in a way that can be either correct or incorrect, depending on whether its container is marshaled by value or as a pointer. This behavior is extremely subtle and can easily lead to silent errors.

Additionally, the package consistently fails to marshal `RawMessage` values correctly when they are used as map value types.

Here is a sample code that demonstrates these issues:

To summarize, the `encoding/json` package's handling of `RawMessage` can be problematic due to the following reasons:
1. The marshaling behavior changes based on whether the container is marshaled by value or as a pointer.
2. `RawMessage` values are not properly marshaled when used as map value types.

These subtleties can lead to unexpected and hard-to-diagnose issues in your JSON serialization logic.
