**Title: Bridging the Caenorhabditis elegans Model Organism Database, Genome-Scale Model, and Metabolite Databases**

**Presenting Author: Michael Witting, Research Unit Analytical BioGeoChemistry, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Germany**

**Co-Authors: Jake P. N. Hattwell, Horst Joachim Schirra, Karen Yook, Keeva Cochrane, Claire O’Donovan**

Despite significant efforts, information on *Caenorhabditis elegans* metabolism, including its genes, proteins, and metabolites, remains scattered across various databases. The WormJam community, a global network of researchers, aims to address this issue by constructing and curating a high-quality consensus genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) for this important biomedical model organism. The resulting WormJam GSMN is currently one of the most comprehensive and well-curated metabolic models for *C. elegans*.

WormJam collaborates with WormBase (www.wormbase.org), the primary repository for *C. elegans* genes, proteins, phenotypes, and related information. Recently, we have begun adding metabolites to this repository. The WormJam model uses ChEBI as the primary source for metabolite structures. In collaboration with the WormJam community, we are working towards full coverage of the *C. elegans* GSMN with metabolite structures. Additionally, we are integrating RheaDB to enable comparisons of metabolic reactions between *C. elegans* and other organisms. We are also collaborating with MetaboLights to link metabolomics raw and reference data.

As an application example, we present a case study on *C. elegans* sphingolipids, analyzed using UPLC-UHR-ToF-MS. This study involved the curation of sphingolipid-related reactions in WormJam, as well as the curation of structures and the collection of reference MS and MS/MS data. Our goal is to further develop the WormJam model and connected databases into a comprehensive knowledge base for future investigations into *C. elegans* metabolism.

**Title: The Use of Mitochondrial Metabolomics in Discovering the Molecular Function of a Mitochondrial Membrane Protein**

**Presenting Author: Daqiang Pan, Centre for Biological Systems Analysis, University of Freiburg, Germany**

**Co-Authors: Caroline Lindau, Simon Lagies, Michael Rodamer, Nils Wiedemann, Bernd Kammerer**

The yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* SYM1 is an ortholog of the human MPV17 gene, mutations in which cause mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. The Sym1 protein is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and its deletion results in impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic functions and morphological features under stress conditions. However, the specific functions of both Mpv17 and Sym1 remain unclear.

Recent studies have revealed compartment-specific metabolic alterations due to mutations or inhibition of mitochondrial proteins, providing new insights into the function of Sym1. To investigate this, mitochondria and corresponding cytoplasmic fractions from wild-type and Δsym1 cells were isolated through differential centrifugation and subjected to metabolomic analysis. The results showed that TCA cycle intermediates were accumulated in Δsym1 cells, consistent with the findings of Dallabona et al., who reported severe OXPHOS defects in Δsym1 under stress conditions. Additionally, the accumulation of saccharopine and reduction in lysine suggested an interruption in lysine biosynthesis, which was confirmed by incubating yeast cells without lysine supply. Furthermore, pyrimidine biosynthesis intermediates, such as carbamoyl-aspartate and orotic acid, were reduced in Δsym1 cells. This effect was exacerbated when the growth temperature was shifted from 30°C to 37°C after eight hours of incubation, indicating that Sym1 may play a role in pyrimidine biosynthesis.

This is the first time that metabolomics has been applied to determine the molecular function of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein Sym1, offering new perspectives on its role in cellular metabolism.

**Title: Computational Modelling of Host-Microbiome Co-Metabolism**

**Presenting Author: Ines Thiele, National University of Ireland, Ireland**

Computational modeling of human and microbial metabolism has gained increasing attention for phenotypic characterization. This is achieved by assembling a high-fidelity computational representation of an organism’s metabolic network based on genomic, biochemical, and physiological data. We have developed a semi-automated pipeline for the assembly of high-fidelity microbial metabolic networks and applied this pipeline to generate a collection of more than 800 gut microbial metabolic networks. These networks can be combined, for example, based on metagenomic data, to predict the emergent metabolic capabilities of the microbial community and their potential effects on the human host.

To facilitate these predictions, we built whole-body metabolic models of a male (Harvey) and a female (Harvetta), which accurately describe the metabolism occurring in 28 organs. Importantly, these whole-body models can be expanded to include strain-resolved metabolic models of gut microbes. I will demonstrate how different microbial compositions lead to differences in host metabolism, such as the capability to produce important neurotransmitters in the brain and flux through liver enzymes, with implications for the gut-brain axis and microbiome-mediated liver toxicity. The predictions are consistent with our current understanding but also highlight that different microbiota compositions can lead to high inter-person variability. I envisage that microbiome-associated whole-body metabolic models will usher in a new era for research into causal host-microbiome relationships and greatly accelerate the development of targeted dietary and microbial intervention strategies.

The exact molecular mechanism of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is currently unknown, but it is believed that metabolic malfunctions play a crucial role in its development. Several genetic risk factors linked to bioenergetic alterations have been identified, including mutations in the PTEN-induced kinase (PINK1), a mitochondrially targeted, neuroprotective serine/threonine protein kinase. However, the link between PINK1 mutations and the metabolic deregulation leading to PD remains largely unexplored.

In this study, we explore the metabolic footprint of a PINK1 mutation by creating a PINK1-specific metabolic model based on integrated patient-derived x-omics data. To provide patient-specific constraints for the PINK1-Q456X mutation, we generated transcriptomic (RNAseq), untargeted proteomics, and quantitative exometabolomic (targeted mass spectrometry) data from in vitro cultures of patient iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons carrying this mutation. Each PINK1-Q456X neuronal line was paired with its isogenic control, in which the PINK1 gene was corrected. Additionally, cell lines derived from healthy volunteers were used for comparison.

Using this x-omics data, we generated constraint-based, genome-scale, patient-specific in silico models of dopaminergic neuronal metabolism affected by the PINK1 mutation (iPINK1). We also created patient-specific control models reflecting the metabolism of isogenic controls (iPINK1iso) and healthy volunteers (iPINK1ctrl). Our models are being used to predict targets for reducing mitochondrial dysfunction. We will check which non-trivial perturbations to reaction rates can compensate for the effect of mutations in monogenic PD patients or improve dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes.

T-helper (Th) cells play a pivotal role in cell-mediated immunity. During their development, T cells undergo metabolic remodeling, which is essential for orchestrating the action of other immune cells. To understand the global metabolism during T-cell development, we developed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) for human Th1, Th2, Th17 subsets, and T-regulatory cells (iTreg). Meta-analysis of T-cell-specific human transcriptomics datasets identified 72 novel metabolic genes, corresponding to 355 reactions spanning various metabolic pathways. Reporter metabolites and pathway overrepresentation analysis suggested that T-cell activation induces gluconeogenesis, glutaminolysis, and lipid biosynthesis.

Moreover, ganglioside (GA1, GMb) and N-acetylneuraminate (NANA) associated with sialyl-T antigen were significantly up-regulated in Th17 cells at 72 hours post-initiation, while glucosyl-, lactosyl-, and galactosyl ceramides were down-regulated. In contrast, such trends were either reversed or absent in iTregs at this time point. Our findings suggest that ceramides are involved in the metabolic regulation and functioning of T-cells. It was also found that Th subsets exhibit unique metabolic phenotypes even during early stages (72 h) of specification, playing a central role in guiding the fate of the cells.

These results are being validated by Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)-based targeted metabolomics experiments. The findings from this study provide a basis for modulating human Th subsets, which is crucial for immune responses under metabolically aberrant conditions and in immune-mediated disorders.

A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes. While the microbial residents in humans are increasingly well-characterized, the breadth of the chemical diversity contributed by the microbiome remains largely unexplored. Using untargeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics and the mass spectrometry database GNPS, we assessed the global metabolite differences between germ-free (GF) and colonized mice. Of the 7,913 molecules detected across 29 murine organs, 14.7% were unique to specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. Unique microbial compounds included bile acids conjugated with the amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine, representing a new tertiary group of bile acids produced by the microbiome that have eluded discovery in 170 years of research on bile chemistry.

Culturing human gut isolates revealed that *Clostridium bolteae* was responsible for the production of these novel conjugates. These molecules were found in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract of mice and were elevated in abundance when fed a high-fat diet. Searching GNPS showed that these novel conjugates are also present in humans and are elevated in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). These novel conjugates strongly agonize the human FXR receptor, a global regulator of bile acid metabolism. Unlike the host-produced glycine and taurine conjugates, these novel molecules could not be deconjugated by the microbiota, making their action on the FXR constitutive. FXR agonism in vivo reduced the overall production of bile, making these molecules microbial manipulators of bile acid metabolism. The discovery of these molecules opens up a new era in bile acid research, linking these novel conjugates with human disease.

**Title: Exploring the Microbiota-Host Epigenetics Axis in Female and Male Germ-Free and Conventional Mice**

Histone modifications are major regulators of the epigenetic machinery, modulating gene expression, DNA repair, and chromatin structure. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) are dynamically regulated by specific modifying enzymes whose activities require metabolites that serve as substrates, cofactors, or activators/inhibitors. The levels of these metabolites depend on host metabolism and environmental factors, including the metabolic activity of the gut microbiota.

To gain new insights into the epigenetic regulation at the interplay between host and gut microbiota metabolites, we studied liver tissue from male and female germ-free (n=20) and conventional (n=20) mice. We implemented a targeted metabolomic analysis by LC-QqQ MS covering >30 epigenetically relevant metabolites, playing a regulatory role in histone acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and N-acetylglucosamination reactions. Simultaneously, we quantified histone PTMs by LC-MS/MS in data-dependent acquisition mode.

Remarkably, we observed that S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) is altered in the absence of microbiota and highly correlates with changes in lysine methylation status of histones H3 and H4. These results were further validated in diet-induced obese mice presenting changes in the gut microbiota composition. Ongoing RNAseq experiments will reveal alterations in the liver transcriptional profile associated with the absence (germ-free) or dysbiosis of the microbiota induced by a high-fat diet.

Plasma metabolome and its inter-individual variation underlie individual susceptibility to various complex diseases. Diet, genetics, and the gut microbiome are determinants of human metabolic status. However, their relative contributions to variation in the plasma metabolome remain elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive host-microbe-diet interaction analysis on over 1,000 plasma metabolites in a population-based Lifelines-Deep cohort (n=1,440). For each individual, we had complete information on the gut microbial taxonomic and functional composition, genetic background, blood metabolites, dietary factors, medication, and clinical phenotypes.

Our study found that diet, genetics, and the gut microbiome explain 9%, 8%, and 14% of variation, respectively. Medication explained 4%, and host physiological status explained 10%. Together, these factors contributed 39% of the variation in the plasma metabolome. On an individual metabolite level, we reported 88 associations to genetics, 369 to gut microbial species, 7,884 to microbial pathways, and 261 to dietary factors at FDR<0.05. Notably, 61 metabolites were associated with all of them, indicating host-microbe-diet interactions. These metabolites are enriched for lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, bile acids, and fatty acids, which in turn can affect host health and disease. Some microbial metabolites synthesized or modulated by the gut microbiome are linked not only to human-derived metabolites but also to the host immune profile.

Taken together, this study reveals important evidence for the significant role of the gut microbiome in host metabolism and its interaction with diet and host genetics, providing clues for future applications in personalized medicine.

Plants coexist with microbes as holobionts, sharing mutually beneficial functions that can be engineered to produce ecologically and environmentally favorable outcomes. The rhizosphere microbial community, which occupies the niche developed by the gradients of root exudates, is of particular interest due to its probable direct role in providing specific factors for plant growth. However, the lack of a model rhizosphere microbial community and its metabolite exchanges with the host has limited the mechanistic understanding of plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.

To fill this gap, we have developed a novel plant holobiont gnotobiotic system with specific characteristics: (i) co-culturing of model plants, such as *Arabidopsis thaliana* or related Brassica leafy vegetables, with a highly complex microbial community of hundreds of taxa; (ii) easy real-time phenotyping of plant growth; (iii) recovery of metabolites from the root surface or root-microbiome interface; and (iv) recovery of the microbiome from the co-culture system. Live exudation from plants supports a highly complex microbiome community of several hundred taxa and the recovery of a highly complex mixture of metabolites. High-resolution and accurate mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap system led to the identification of more than 15,000 de-isotoped molecular features.

Using this system, we show a very specific plant growth effect by the enriched rhizosphere microbial community on the plants through different distinct metabolic pathways, compared to the bulk-soil microbial community. The mechanistic understanding from this research framework can be used to enhance yields in specific crops without adding carbon or water footprints to the system.

**Title: An Untargeted LC-MS Based Workflow for the Structural Characterization of Biological Polyesters**

**Presenting Author: Rebecca Dauwe, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, France**

**Co-Authors: Benjamin Thiombiano, Roland Molinié, Paulo Marcelo, Eric Gontier, François Mesnard**

We developed an LC-MS-based strategy to characterize fragments of the lignin macromolecule, a complex phenolic polyester that accumulates in flax seed integuments. The polyester was subjected to a dynamic alkaline hydrolysis process, stopped after a series of increasing reaction times, and the hydrolysates were analyzed by LC-MSn. Analysis of the final hydrolysates led to the identification of 31 monomeric subunits. For the characterization of partial hydrolysates, we show that the annotation of pairs of related LC-MS features, based on m/z differences, strongly facilitates their characterization.

Using self-organizing maps, we preselected candidate ester-containing compounds that transiently appeared during the dynamic hydrolysis process. Among all possible pairs of the preselected features, we revealed 46 overrepresented m/z differences that corresponded to the addition of identified macromolecule monomers or theoretically possible oligo-esters built of two or three monomeric units. To reveal the features that represent different fragments of the same lignan macromolecule, a candidate substrate-product pair network connecting the selected features by the annotated overrepresented m/z differences was built. The network information was then combined with the interpretation of MSn data to elucidate the structures of the saponification fragments. In total, 120 distinct oligo-esters, consisting of up to 6 lignan macromolecule monomers, could be characterized. These results allowed us to further elaborate the existing structural model of the lignan macromolecule. Our network approach shows promise for tackling the structural characterization of different types of complex plant polyesters, such as suberin and cutin.

**Title: NMR-MS Metabolomics Reveals Sulfonation in the Salicaceae**

**Presenting Author: Clarice Noleto-Dias, Rothamsted Research, United Kingdom**

**Co-Authors: Claudia Harflett, Jane L. Ward, Michael H. Beale**

The Salicaceae family is characterized by the presence of phenolics, including the glycosides of the salicinoid sub-group and different types of flavonoids. Rothamsted Research is home to the National Willow Collection, comprising 1,500 different accessions. In addition, large-scale mapping populations have been developed. A metabolomics screen of a diversity panel comprising mapping population members and their parental lines suggested that a particular population (MpF) was dominated by metabolites not observed in other *Salix* species. Fractionation via HPLC was performed to isolate all the novel compounds present in the sample. Five sulfated compounds were isolated, and their structures were elucidated by LC-HRMS-MS and 1D and 2D-NMR. Four compounds were found in leaf and stem tissues of *S. alberti x S. integra x S. suchowensis* hybrid (NWC901), a parent of MpF, and were characterized as taxifolin-7-sulfate, dihydrokaempferol-7-sulfate, eriodictyol-7-sulfate, and narigenin-7-sulfate.

Although sulfation of natural products is not rare and occurs often in mammalian metabolism, most examples from the plant world concern sulfated flavonoids from flavonol and flavone subclasses, different from the flavanonols and flavanones reported herein. An additional compound, salicin-7-sulfate, was also identified in the LC-MS datasets of stem tissue samples harvested at the dormant stage of some of the 86 pure *Salix* genotypes. Among these lines, no correlation between the amount of salicin and its sulfated form could be detected. We will present data on compounds that have not been previously described in plants and discuss the implications of their presence in willow, a plant traditionally used in herbal medicine.

**Co-Authors: Romanas Chaleckis, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Isabel Meister, Pei Zhang, Craig E. Wheelock, Masanori Arita**

Metabolite identification remains a major challenge in untargeted metabolomics. Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is essential for information-rich and reproducible analysis of the metabolome, but the acquired full-scan MS2 spectra are highly complex and pose significant challenges for annotation and identification. We have developed a new deconvolution method (CorrDec) that exploits the correlation between peak intensities of precursor and fragment ions in multi-sample studies measured with All Ion Fragmentation (AIF). Its main advantage is the discrimination of completely co-eluting, low-abundance compounds; this is the first software approach that systematically disentangles clean MS2 spectra from full-scan AIF data.

CorrDec was implemented in our MS-DIAL software (version 3.32 or later), and its performance was rigorously assessed with the original, retention-time-based MS-DIAL deconvolution (MS2Dec) using a dilution series of chemical standards and biological samples. Both methods function in complement, and the benefit of CorrDec is the extraction of cleaner, i.e., more library-matching MS2 spectra than MS2Dec when multiple samples are available. In this presentation, we report a detailed performance comparison of both deconvolution methods and our randomized assessment using biological samples to estimate the required number of measurements for CorrDec. We also introduce the interpretation of deconvoluted MS2 spectra of marginally identifiable metabolites, using co-eluting betaines as a model case.

**Title: Evaluation of Molecular Ionization Propensities in Different Ionization Modes: Providing Evidence for the Presence of Small Molecules in Synthetic Blinded Samples**

**Presenting Author: Jamie Nunez, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, United States**

**Co-Authors: Sean Colby, Thomas Metz, Justin Teeguarden, Ryan Renslow**

For non-targeted metabolomics analysis, the relative ionization propensities of molecules analyzed using different ion sources (e.g., electrospray, ESI; atmospheric pressure photoionization, APPI) are not well understood. Improved understanding of ionization propensities would offer many advantages in metabolomics, such as (i) a priori selection of ionization modes based on suspected sample composition, (ii) the ability to reduce the number of candidate structures during data analysis by removing those less likely to ionize, and (iii) a reduced false discovery rate and increased confidence in identifications.

Here, we discuss a blinded analysis of synthetic chemical mixtures, each containing up to hundreds of unique compounds, as part of the U.S. EPA’s Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). We report how different ionization modes contributed to overall identifications, as well as how certain chemical properties (e.g., pKa, LogP, molecular mass, ring-count) and chemical substructures (e.g., heterocyclic rings and carboxyl, carboxamide, and phosphino groups) influence ionization propensities. For example, several chemical properties were found to be statistically significantly different for compounds identified using ESI or APPI, and in positive or negative ionization modes. Furthermore, we clustered compounds based on their chemical properties, chemical class, and chemical substructures, and found that certain properties and substructures were highly correlated with detection in specific ionization modes, while chemical class, derived from an automated ontology (ClassyFire), did not provide strong discriminating information. While similar analyses have been performed on a small scale in the past, our fully automated approach facilitated a large-scale analysis and provides a foundation for future studies.
