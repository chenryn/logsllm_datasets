Bringing together what belongs together – Bridging the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism database, 
genome scale model and metabolite databases
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Michael Witting, Research Unit Analytical BioGeoChemistry, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Jake P. N. Hattwell, Horst Joachim Schirra, Karen Yook, Keeva Cochrane, Claire O’Donovan
Despite considerable efforts, information on Caenorhabditis elegans metabolism, its genes, proteins and metabolites is currently scattered across different 
databases The WormJam (short for Worm Jamboree) community is a world-wide community of researchers who aim to rectify this situation by constructing 
and curating a high-quality consensus genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) of this important biomedical model organism The resulting WormJam 
GSMN is currently one of the best curated metabolic models for C elegans WormJam collaborates with WormBase (wwwwormbaseorg), the premier 
repository for C elegans genes, proteins, phenotypes, and related information We have recently started to also add metabolites to this repository The 
WormJam model uses ChEBI as primary information and deposition source for metabolite structures, and together with the WormJam community we 
have started towards full coverage of the C elegans GSMN with metabolite structures In addition, we are working on the integration of RheaDB to allow 
comparison of metabolic reactions between other organisms and C elegans Furthermore, we are collaborating with MetaboLights to link metabolomics 
raw and reference data Here we present an application example using a case study on C elegans sphinoglipids and their analysis using UPLC-UHR-ToF-
MS We started from the correction and curation of sphingolipid-related reactions in WormJam as well as curation of structures, collection of reference MS 
and MS/MS We are aiming to further develop the WormJam model and connected database as a comprehensive knowledge base for future investigations 
into the metabolism of C elegans

The use of mitochondrial metabolomics in discovering the molecular function of a mitochondrial  
membrane protein

CO-AUTHORS: Caroline Lindau, Simon Lagies, Michael Rodamer, Nils Wiedemann, Bernd Kammerer
Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae SYM1 is an ortholog of the human MPV17 gene whose mutation causes mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome Sym1 
protein is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane and its deletion results in impaired mitochondrial bioenergetic functions and morphological features 
under stress conditions However, the functions of both Mpv17 and Sym1 have not been clearly characterized Recently, compartment-specific metabolic 
alterations to mutations or inhibition of mitochondrial proteins were revealed by analyzing isolated mitochondria, opening new doors for uncovering the 
function of Sym1 Therefore, mitochondria and the corresponding cytoplasmic fraction of wild type and Δsym1 cells were isolated through differential 
centrifugation and subjected to metabolomic analysis TCA cycle intermediates were accumulated overall in Δsym1 cells This correlates with the results 
of Dallabona et al, which showed severe OXPHOS defects of Δsym1 under stress conditions Meanwhile, accumulated saccharopine and reduced lysine 
suggested an interrupted lysine biosynthesis, which was proved by incubating yeast cells without the supply of lysine Interestingly, pyrimidine biosynthesis 
intermediates, carbamoyl-aspartate and orotic acid, were reduced in Δsym1 cells This situation became worse when the growth temperature was shifted, 
after incubation for eight hours, from 30 °C to 37 °C for eight hours, indicating that sym1 may play a role in pyrimidine biosynthesis This is the first time 
that metabolomics was applied to determine the molecular function of the mitochondrial inner membrane protein sym1, which gives new aspects in 
understanding its function

Computational modelling of host-microbiome co-metabolism
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ines Thiele, National University of Ireland, Ireland
Computational modelling of human and microbial metabolism has gained increasing attention for phenotypic characterization Such modelling is achieved 
by assembling in a bottom-up manner a high-fidelity computational representation of an organism’s metabolic network based on genomic, biochemical, 
and physiological data We have developed a semi-automated pipeline for the assembly of high-fidelity microbial metabolic networks and applied this 
pipeline to generate a collection of more than 800 gut microbial metabolic networks We can now combine these metabolic networks, eg, based on 
metagenomic data, to predict emergent metabolic capabilities of the microbial community and their potential effect on the human host To that end, we 
built whole-body metabolic models of a male (deemed Harvey) and a female (deemed Harvetta), which describe accurately the metabolism occurring in 
28 organs Importantly, these whole-body models can be expanded to include the strain-resolved metabolic models of gut microbes I will demonstrate 
how different microbial composition leads to differences in host metabolism, such as the capability to produce important neurotransmitters in the brain and 
flux through liver enzymes, with implications for the gut-brain axis as well as for microbiome-mediated liver toxicity The predictions were consistent with 
our current understanding but also highlighted that different microbiota composition can lead to high inter-person variability I envisage the microbiome-
associated whole-body metabolic models will usher in a new era for research into causal host-microbiome relationships and greatly accelerate the 
development of targeted dietary and microbial intervention strategies

Metabollic footprint of Parkinson’s Disease: integration of patient-derived X-omics data with a human  
genome-scale model.

The exact molecular mechanism of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is currently unknown However, it is believed that metabolic malfunctions play an essential role 
in the development of PD Several genetic risk factors linked to bioenergetic alterations were identified, including mutations in a mitochondrially targeted, 
neuroprotective serine/threonine protein kinase PTEN-induced kinase (PINK1) However, the link between PINK1 mutations and the metabolic deregulation 
that leads to the development of PD remains mostly unknown Here, we explore the metabolic footprint of a PINK1 mutation by creating a PINK1-specific 
metabolic model based on integrated patient-derived x-omics data To provide patient-specific constraints of the PINK1-Q456X mutation for the model, we 
generated transcriptomic (RNAseq), untargeted proteomics, and quantitative exometabolomic (targeted mass spectrometry) data from in vitro cultures of 
patient iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons carrying this mutation Each PINK1-Q456X neuronal line was paired with its isogenic control, in which the PINK1 
gene was corrected Additionally, cell lines derived from healthy volunteers were used for comparison With this x-omics data, we generated constraint-
based, genome-scale, patient-specific in silico models of dopaminergic neuronal metabolism affected by the PINK1 mutation (iPINK1) Furthermore, we 
created patient-specific control models reflecting the metabolism of isogenic controls (iPINK1iso) and healthy volunteers (iPINK1ctrl) Our models are being 
used to predict targets for reducing mitochondrial dysfunction We will check which non-trivial perturbations to reaction rate(s) can compensate for the 
effect of mutations in monogenic PD patients, or act to improve dysfunctional mitochondrial phenotypes

T-helper (Th) cells play a pivotal role in cell-mediated immunity During the development, T cells undergo metabolic remodeling that is essential for 
orchestrating the action of other immune cells In order to understand global metabolism during T-cell development, we developed genome-scale 
metabolic models (GEMs) for human Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets and T-regulatory cells (iTreg)1 Meta-analysis of T-cell specific human transcriptomics 
datasets have identified 72 novel metabolic genes, corresponding to 355 reactions spanning various metabolic pathways Reporter metabolites and 
pathway overrepresentation analysis suggested that T-cell activation induces gluconeogenesis, glutaminolysis, and lipid biosynthesis Moreover, 
ganglioside (GA1, GMb) and N-acetylneuraminate (NANA) associated with sialyl-T antigen were significantly up-regulated in Th17 cells at 72 hours of 
initiation, while the glucosyl-, lactosyl- and galactosyl ceramides were down-regulated On contrary, such trends were either reversed or absent in 
iTregs at this time-point Our findings suggest that, ceramides are involved in the metabolic regulations and functioning of T-cells It was also found that, 
Th subsets exhibit unique metabolic phenotype, already during early stages (72 h) of specification, thus playing a central role in guiding the fate of the 
cells These results are being validated by Liquid Chromatography and Mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based targeted metabolomics experiments The 
findings from this study, provide a basis for modulation of human Th subsets crucial for immune responses under metabolically aberrant conditions and 
in immune-mediated disorders

A mosaic of cross-phyla chemical interactions occurs between all metazoans and their microbiomes These microbial residents in humans are increasingly 
well characterized, but we have yet to elucidate the breadth of the chemical diversity the microbiome contributes We used untargeted LC-MS/MS based 
metabolomics and the mass spectrometry database GNPS to assess the global metabolite differences between germ-free (GF) and colonized mice Of the 
7,913 molecules detected across 29 murine organs, 147% were unique to SPF Unique microbial compounds included bile acids conjugated with the amino 
acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and leucine, which represent a new tertiary group of bile acids produced by the microbiome that have eluded discovery in 
the 170 years of research on bile chemistry Culturing human gut isolates revealed that Clostridium bolteae was responsible for their production These 
molecules were found in the upper GI tract of mice and elevated in abundance when fed high fat Searching GNPS showed that they are also present in 
humans and elevated in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) These novel conjugates strongly agonize the human FXR receptor, which is a 
global regulator of bile acid metabolism Unlike the host produced glycine and taurine conjugates, these novel molecules could not be deconjugated by 
the microbiota, making their action on the FXR constitutive FXR agonism in vivo reduced the overall production of bile, making these molecules microbial 
manipulators of bile acid metabolism The discovery of these molecules opens up a new era in bile acid research linking these novel conjugates with 
human disease

Histone modifications are major regulators of the epigenetic machinery, due to their ability to modulate gene expression, DNA repair and chromatin 
structure These post-translational modifications (PTMs) are dynamically regulated by specific modifying enzymes whose activities require metabolites that 
either serve as substrates, cofactors or act as activators/inhibitors The level of these metabolites depend on host metabolism and environmental factors, 
including the metabolic activity of gut microbiota Here, liver tissue from male and female germ-free (n=20) and conventional (n=20) mice has been studied 
to gain new knowledge on the epigenetic regulation at the interplay between host and gut microbiota metabolites To do this, we have implemented 
a targeted metabolomic analysis by LC-QqQ MS covering >30 epigenetically relevant metabolites playing a regulatory role in histone acetylation, 
methylation, phosphorylation, ADP-ribosylation, and N-acetylglucosamination reactions At the same time, we have quantified histone PTMs by LC-MS/MS 
in data dependent acquisition mode Remarkably, we observed that S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) is altered in the absence of microbiota and this highly 
correlates with changes in lysine methylation status of histones H3 and H4 These results were further validated in diet-induced obese mice presenting 
changes in the gut microbiota composition Furthermore, ongoing RNAseq experiments will hopefully reveal alterations in the liver transcriptional profile 
associated with the absence (germ-free) or dysbiosis of the microbiota induced by a high fat diet

Plasma metabolome and its inter-individual variation underlie individual’s susceptibility of various complex diseases Diet, genetics, and the gut microbiome 
are determinants of human metabolic status However, their relative contributions to variation in plasma metabolome remain elusive Here, we present a 
comprehensive host-microbe-diet interaction analysis on over 1000 plasma metabolites in a population-based Lifelines-Deep cohort (n=1,440), for each 
individual we had completed information on the gut microbial taxonomic and functional composition, genetic background, blood metabolites, dietary 
factors, medication and clinical phenotypes Our study found diet, genetics and gut microbiome could explain 9%, 8% and 14% of variation respectively 
Moreover, medication explained 4% and host physiological status could explain 10% These factors together contributed 39% of variation in plasma 
metabolome On individual metabolite level, we reported 88 associations to genetics, 369 to the gut microbial species, 7884 to microbial pathways and 
261 to dietary factors at FDR<005 Notable, 61 metabolites were associated to all of them, indicating host-microbe-diet interactions These metabolites 
are enriched for lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, bile acids and fatty acids, which in turns can affect host health and disease Notable, some microbial 
metabolites synthesized or modulated by the gut microbiome are linked not only to human derived metabolites but also linked to host immune profile 
Taken together, this study reveals important evidence for a significant role of the gut microbiome in host metabolism and its interaction with diet and host 
genetics, providing clues for future applications in personalized medicine

A novel plant-microbiome co-culturing system reveals key associations of specific metabolites with  
plant growth and stress tolerance
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sanjay Swarup, National University of Singapore, Singapore
CO-AUTHORS: Gourvendu Saxena, Ee Yong Lian, Pavagadhi Shruti, Miko Poh Chin Hong, Yeap Yoon Ting
Plants coexist with microbes as holobionts, sharing mutually beneficial functions, which can be engineered to produce ecologically and environmentally 
favorable outcomes The rhizosphere microbial community, which occupies the niche developed by the gradients of root exudates in the rhizosphere 
region is of particular interest due to its probable direct role in providing specific factors for plant growth However, the lack of a model rhizosphere 
microbial community and its metabolite exchanges with the host has limited the much needed mechanistic understanding of plant-microbe interactions 
in the rhizosphere To fill this gap, we have developed a novel plant holobiont gnotobiotic system with specific characteristics of (i) co-culturing of model 
plant, Arabidopsis thaliana or related Brassica leafy vegetables, with a highly complex microbial community of hundreds of taxa; (ii) easy real-time 
phenotyping of plant growth; (iii) metabolites recovery from root surface or root-microbiome interface and (iv) microbiome recovery from the co-culture 
system Live exudation from plants supports a highly complex microbiome community of several hundred taxa and recovery of highly complex metabolites 
mixture High Resolution and Accurate Mass –mass spectrometry using an Orbitrap system led to the identification of more than 15,000 de-isotoped 
molecular features Using this system, we show a very specific plant growth effect by the enriched rhizosphere microbial community on the plants 
through different distinct metabolic pathways, when compared with the bulk-soil microbial community The mechanistic understanding from this research 
framework can be used on specific crops to enhance the yields without adding carbon or water footprint to the system

An untargeted LC-MS based work-flow for the structural characterization of biological polyesters
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rebecca Dauwe, Université de Picardie Jules Verne, France
CO-AUTHORS: Benjamin Thiombiano, Roland Molinié, Paulo Marcelo, Eric Gontier, François Mesnard
We developed an LC-MS based strategy to characterize fragments of the lignin macromolecule, a complex phenolic polyester that accumulates in flax seed 
integuments The polyester was subjected to a dynamic alkaline hydrolysis process that was stopped after a series of increasing reaction times, and the 
hydrolysates were analyzed by LC-MSn Analysis of the final hydrolysates led to the identification of 31 monomeric subunits For the characterization of the 
partial hydrolysates, we show that the annotation of pairs of related LC-MS features, based on m/z differences, strongly facilitates their characterization 
Using self-organizing maps, we first preselected as candidate ester-containing compounds those features that transiently appeared during the dynamic 
hydrolysis process Among all possible pairs of the preselected features, we revealed 46 overrepresented m/z differences that corresponded to the 
addition of identified macromolecule monomers or of theoretically possible oligo-esters built of two or three monomeric units In order to reveal the 
features that represent different fragments of the same lignan macromolecule, a candidate substrate-product pair network connecting the selected 
features by the annotated overrepresented m/z differences was built The network information was then combined with the interpretation of MSn data 
to elucidate the stuctures of the saponification fragments In total, 120 distinct oligo-esters, consisting of up to 6 lignan macromolecule monomers could 
be characterized These results allowed us to further elaborate the existing structural model of the lignan macromolecule Our network approach shows 
promising to tackle the structural characterization of different types of complex plant polyesters, such as suberin and cutin

NMR-MS metabolomics reveals sulfonation in the Salicaceae
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Clarice Noleto-Dias, Rothamsted Research, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Claudia Harflett, Jane L. Ward, Michael H. Beale
The Salicaceae family is characterised by the presence of phenolics, including the glycosides of the salicinoid sub-group and different types of flavonoids 
Rothamsted Research is home to the National Willow Collection, comprising 1500 different accessions In addition, large scale mapping populations have 
been developed A metabolomics screen of a diversity panel comprising mapping population members and their parental lines suggested that a particular 
population (MpF) was dominated by metabolites not observed in other Salix species Fractionation via HPLC was performed to isolate all the novel 
compounds present in the sample Five sulfated compounds were isolated and their structures elucidated by LC-HRMS-MS and 1D and 2D-NMR Four 
compounds were found in leaf and stem tissues of S alberti x S integra x S suchowensis hybrid (NWC901), a parent of MpF, and these were characterised 
as taxifolin-7-sulfate, dihydrokaempferol-7-sulfate, eriodictyol-7-sulfate and narigenin-7-sulfate Although sulfation of natural products is not rare, and 
occurs often in mammalian metabolism, most examples from the plant world concern sulfated flavonoids from flavonol and flavone subclasses, different 
to the flavanonols and flavanones reported herein An additional compound, salicin-7-sulfate, was also identified in the LC-MS datasets of stem tissue 
samples harvested at the dormant stage of some of the 86 pure Salix genotypes Among these lines, no correlation between the amount of salicin and its 
sulfated form could be detected We will present data on compounds that have not been previously described in plants and discuss the implications of their 
presence in willow, a plant traditionally used in herbal medicine

Correlation-based deconvolution (CorrDec) method for data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ipputa Tada, Department of Genetics, SOKENDAI (Graduate University for Advanced Studies), Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Romanas Chaleckis, Hiroshi Tsugawa, Isabel Meister, Pei Zhang, Craig E. Wheelock, Masanori Arita
Metabolite identification is still a major challenge in untargeted metabolomics Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is essential 
for information-rich and reproducible analysis of metabolome, but the acquired full-scan MS2 spectra are highly complex and pose harder challenges 
for annotation and identification We have developed a new deconvolution method (CorrDec) that exploits the correlation between peak intensities of 
precursor and fragment ions in multi-sample studies measured with All Ion Fragmentation (AIF) Its main advantage is the discrimination of completely 
co-eluting, low-abundance compounds; this is the first software approach that systematically disentangles clean MS2 spectra from full-scan AIF data The 
CorrDec was implemented in our MS-DIAL software (version 332 or later) and its performance was rigorously assessed with the original, retention-time 
based MS-DIAL deconvolution (MS2Dec) using a dilution series of chemical standards and biological samples Both methods function in complement, 
and the benefit of CorrDec is extraction of cleaner, ie, more library-matching MS2 spectra than MS2Dec when multiple samples are available In this 
presentation, we report detailed performance comparison of both deconvolution methods and our randomized assessment using biological samples to 
estimate the required number of measurements for CorrDec We also introduce interpretation of deconvoluted MS2 spectra of marginally identifiable 
metabolites, using co-eluting betaines as a model case

Evaluation of molecular ionization propensities in different ionization modes: providing evidence for the 
presence of small molecules in synthetic blinded samples
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jamie Nunez, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Sean Colby, Thomas Metz, Justin Teeguarden, Ryan Renslow
For non-targeted metabolomics analysis, the relative ionization propensities of molecules analyzed using different ion sources (eg electrospray, ESI; 
atmospheric pressure photoionization, APPI) is not well understood Improved understanding of ionization propensities would offer many advantages in 
metabolomics, such as (i) a priori selection of ionization modes based on suspected sample composition, (ii) the ability to reduce the number of candidate 
structures during data analysis by removing those less likely to ionize, and (iii) a reduced false discovery rate and increased confidence in identifications 
Here, we will discuss a blinded analysis of synthetic chemical mixtures, each containing up to hundreds of unique compounds, as part of the US EPA’s 
Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) We report how different ionization modes contributed to overall identifications, as well as how certain 
chemical properties (eg, pKa, LogP, molecular mass, ring-count) and chemical substructures (eg, heterocyclic rings and carboxyl, carboxamide, and 
phosphino groups) influence ionization propensities For example, several chemical properties were found to be statistically significantly different for 
compounds identified using ESI or APPI, and in positive or negative ionization modes Furthermore, we clustered compounds based on their chemical 
properties, chemical class, and chemical substructures, and found that certain properties and substructures were highly correlated with detection in 
specific ionization modes, while chemical class, derived from an automated ontology (ClassyFire) did not provide strong discriminating information While 
similar analyses have been performed on a small scale in the past, our fully automated approach facilitated a large-scale analysis and provides a foundation
