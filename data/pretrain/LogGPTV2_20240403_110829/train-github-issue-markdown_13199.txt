##### Issue Type:
Feature Idea
##### Ansible Version:
ansible 1.5.4
##### Environment:
N/A
##### Summary:
Related to #3245 I'd like to request the ability to use vars_prompt in a role,
such as:
  * an action "include_vars_prompt" similar to "include_vars" but which functions as vars_prompt does
OR
  * have the ability to have vars_prompt function in role vars files (perhaps a ROLES/vars/prompt.yml file in addition to main.yml)
My use case:  
My deployment system uses a role to handle the actual deployment.
Specifically, hosts are grouped in inventory into application groups, each
group has a group_vars file that sets the required vars (git repos, pip files,
application name, etc..) for the role to perform the deployment with.
Our main playbook then has a play for each application, targeted at the
application group, that calls the deployment role.
What I would like to do now is easily add vars_prompt: functionality into the
deployment role so that I may prompt the user for the desired release to
deploy. For automated invocation, the release would need to be supplied as an
extra var, which is fine.
Having this feature would allow me to avoid having to duplicate via copy-n-
paste the vars_prompt bits for each application deployment play. Since I have
multiple prompts per application and would like to use Jinja templates to
define the prompt and default vars, the repetition of this code gets unwieldy
quickly. Moreso when I end up needing to split applications up into separate
playbooks.
Thanks!
