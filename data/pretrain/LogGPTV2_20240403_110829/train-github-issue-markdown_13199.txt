### Issue Type:
Feature Request

### Ansible Version:
1.5.4

### Environment:
N/A

### Summary:
In reference to issue #3245, I would like to propose the addition of a feature that allows the use of `vars_prompt` within roles. This could be implemented in one of two ways:

1. **New Action: `include_vars_prompt`**  
   Similar to `include_vars`, this new action would function as `vars_prompt` does, allowing for dynamic variable prompting within a role.

2. **Support for `vars_prompt` in Role Variables Files**  
   Introduce a new file, such as `ROLES/vars/prompt.yml`, in addition to the existing `main.yml`. This file would contain `vars_prompt` definitions, enabling role-specific prompts.

### Use Case:
Our deployment system uses a role to handle the actual deployment process. Specifically, hosts are grouped in the inventory into application groups, and each group has a `group_vars` file that sets the required variables (e.g., Git repositories, pip files, application name, etc.) for the role to perform the deployment.

The main playbook includes a play for each application, targeted at the respective application group, which calls the deployment role. I would like to add `vars_prompt` functionality to the deployment role to prompt the user for the desired release to deploy. For automated invocations, the release should be supplied as an extra variable, which is acceptable.

### Benefits:
Implementing this feature would allow us to avoid duplicating the `vars_prompt` code for each application deployment play. Since we have multiple prompts per application and use Jinja templates to define the prompts and default values, the repetition of this code becomes cumbersome, especially when applications need to be split into separate playbooks.

Thank you for considering this feature request!
