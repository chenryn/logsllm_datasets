Atom should support the shortcuts or "shell links" that Windows uses. Currently, when a file is dragged into Atom or a shortcut is selected from the tree view, the binary file is opened directly instead of following the link to its target. 

For reference, an example of a Windows shortcut icon is shown below:

To improve user experience, Atom should be able to follow these shortcuts and open the linked files instead of the shortcut files themselves.
