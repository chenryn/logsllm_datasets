### 5.4 Overall Perceptions of Security and Usability

Participants rated their perceptions of security, privacy, and ease of use on a Likert scale in response to broad statements about the account creation process. We found that the authentication mechanism, and to a lesser extent, the biometric WebAuthn notification shown, influenced these perceptions.

#### Security Perceptions
As illustrated in Figure 5b, the distribution of responses to the statement "I think account creation at ExampleTech is secure" varied significantly across conditions (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 29.4, p < .001). In each of the six biometric conditions, at least 60% of participants strongly or somewhat agreed with this statement. Specifically, 82% of Biometric-Shared and 78% of Biometric-Hacked participants strongly or somewhat agreed. In contrast, only 38% of Non-biometric participants and 57% of Password participants strongly or somewhat agreed. 

Statistical comparisons revealed:
- Agreement was significantly higher for Biometric-Shared than for Non-biometric (p < .001) and Password (p = .003).
- Agreement was significantly higher for Biometric-Hacked than for Non-biometric (p < .001) and Password (p = .009).
- Agreement was significantly higher for Biometric-Brands than for Non-biometric (p = .020), and marginally higher compared to Password (p = .080).
- Agreement for Biometric-Control was significantly higher than for Non-biometric (p = .043), and marginally higher compared to Biometric-Leaves (p = .080).

The most common justification for perceiving registration as secure among biometric groups was the general reliability of biometrics (20% of participants). For example, Participant P56 wrote, "Biometrics are usually pretty reliable."

#### Privacy Perceptions
Responses to the statement "I think account creation at ExampleTech protects the privacy of my fingerprint/PIN/..." also varied by condition (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 17.1, p = 0.025), as shown in Figure 5a. Agreement was significantly higher for Biometric-Shared than for Non-biometric (p = 0.025) and Password (p = 0.025). Specifically, 64% of Biometric-Shared participants felt their data was kept private, compared to 35% of Non-biometric and 32% of Password participants.

In free-text justifications, 33 participants indicated that their assigned mechanism protected their privacy because the biometric data remained on their phone. Of these participants, 24% were in the Biometric-Shared, 24% in the Biometric-Stored, and 30% in the Biometric-Leaves conditions.

#### Ease of Use
Across all conditions, participants generally found account creation easy. As shown in Figure 5d, 89% of participants "strongly" agreed, and 9% "somewhat" agreed with the statement "I think account creation at ExampleTech is easy." These responses did not vary significantly by condition. The primary justification for perceiving WebAuthn as easy was its speed. Several participants in the biometric groups also noted the advantage of not needing to remember passwords. For example, Participant P163 wrote, "I don’t have to remember any passwords and I don’t have to worry about losing the password."

### 5.5 Security Misconceptions

#### Storage Location
To assess participants' mental models regarding the storage location of biometric or non-biometric fallback data (e.g., PIN) when using WebAuthn, we asked a multiple-choice question: "Where do you think your chosen biometric/fallback secret (or data derived from it) is stored when you created an account at ExampleTech? Select all that apply." The options provided included "on my phone," "on ExampleTech’s computers," "on your phone manufacturer’s computers," "on the computers of a third-party that handles the login process," "on the computers of another third-party," and a fill-in-the-blank "other."

In WebAuthn, the biometric is stored only on the phone, which is crucial for users' privacy. However, only 40% of participants across the seven WebAuthn conditions correctly chose only "on my phone." While 55% of Biometric-Stored and 50% of Biometric-Leaves participants chose only "on my phone," compared to 33-39% in the other conditions, these differences were not statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(6) = 7.7, p = 0.265). 

Misconceptions included:
- 22% incorrectly believed the data is stored only on ExampleTech’s computers.
- 10% thought it is stored in both places.
- 7% incorrectly believed it is stored on the computers of a third-party handling the login process.

When asked about the storage location for unlocking a phone, 71% of participants correctly chose only "on my phone." Despite the actual storage location being identical, more participants had misconceptions about WebAuthn than phone unlocking.

#### Access to Biometric Data
We asked participants if they expected a member of our research team who maintains the ExampleTech website to have access to their biometric data. 15% incorrectly answered "probably" or "definitely yes," primarily because they thought the data was stored in ExampleTech’s database or that employee access was necessary for maintenance. Interestingly, participants in all biometric conditions except Biometric-Leaves and Biometric-Stored noted that biometric data has no value to employees or that there is no reason for them to access it.

#### Processing of Biometric Data
Participants responded to the statement: "If an attacker stole data from the ExampleTech database, do you think the attacker would have your fingerprint/PIN/...?" Responses varied across conditions (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 41.1, p < .001). 43% of Non-biometric participants incorrectly believed attackers could "probably" or "definitely" get their non-biometric mechanism. In contrast, no more than 20% of participants in any of the six biometric conditions incorrectly believed the attacker could "probably" or "definitely" get their biometric. These differences were statistically significant between Non-biometric and all six biometric conditions (all p ≤ .020), as well as between Password and all six biometric conditions (all p ≤ .005).

#### Third-Party Access
Between 23% (Biometric-Stored) and 39% (Biometric-Leaves) of participants incorrectly thought their biometrics or data derived from them were sent to a third party for processing. Between 12% and 20% of participants per biometric condition mentioned that a confirmation or vaguely defined "login token" is sent by the third-party service upon successful authentication. In contrast, 14% of Biometric-Leaves participants correctly noted that no biometric data is sent.

#### Lost Phones
We asked if someone who found a lost phone could access the participant’s account. Responses varied by condition (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 54.6, p < .001). At most, 10% of participants in any biometric condition answered "probably" or "definitely" yes, compared to 41% of Password and 15% of Non-biometric participants. Agreement was significantly higher for Password and Non-biometric compared to all six biometric conditions (all p < .001 and all p ≤ .036, respectively). Biometric participants emphasized that someone who found their phone would not have their biometric. Only 7 participants across all biometric groups correctly noted that attackers could use the device’s fallback PIN, pattern, or password.

#### Cross-Site Usage
We investigated whether participants thought an employee of a trustworthy/untrustworthy website where the participant is also registered could access their account at ExampleTech. 48% of Password participants expected an untrustworthy site could leverage their password to sign into other sites, which is the case if the user reuses passwords. In contrast, 40% of Non-biometric participants and up to 39% of participants in each biometric condition incorrectly thought they were putting themselves at risk. When asked about "companies, such as eBay, Google, and Microsoft," only 15% answered "probably yes" or "definitely yes," highlighting the need for further education that WebAuthn can be used safely even on potentially untrustworthy websites.

### 5.6 Usability Misconceptions

#### Availability
Only 38% of participants across the six biometric conditions correctly realized they could sign into their account even if the scanner failed to read their biometric; 46% incorrectly thought they would be unable to do so. Incorrect justifications often suggested that participants were unaware that biometric WebAuthn always has a non-biometric fallback. Some assumed they could use classic reset mechanisms like email recovery or calling a website’s service hotline.

#### Multiple Devices
Among participants, 34% thought they "probably" or "definitely" could log into ExampleTech via WebAuthn while using a different device (e.g., a friend’s phone), while another 17% were unsure. Most participants who thought they could log in from another device incorrectly assumed their biometric was stored by ExampleTech. A few, however, correctly realized that they could register a separate account on another device.

#### Delegating Access
Asked if a friend or family member could sign into the participant’s account with their permission, 10% or fewer of the participants in any biometric condition answered "probably" or "definitely yes." This result emphasizes that the vast majority of participants were unaware that they could share their phone and its non-biometric fallback method (e.g., the phone’s unlock PIN) to delegate access. While there were no significant differences across biometric conditions, perceptions varied across conditions (Kruskal-Wallis χ²(7) = 107.4, p < .001). Specifically, 52% of Password and 60% of Non-biometric participants realized they could delegate access, which is significantly higher than in any biometric group (all p < .001).

### 5.7 Comparison of Notifications

To understand the impact of the notifications designed based on Study 2, we asked a series of questions to all biometric participants about the five notifications other than Biometric-Control. Condition names refer only to the notification; every biometric participant saw every notification in a randomized order in a within-subjects design. An overview of the results is given in Figure 6.

#### Security Impressions
As shown in Figure 6a, responses to "how secure would you feel using your fingerprint or face to create an account at ExampleTech?" varied across notifications (Friedman χ²(4) = 196.6, p < .001). Among participants, 51% reported they would feel "extremely secure" after viewing Biometric-Leaves, and 50% reported the same after viewing Biometric-Stored. In contrast, fewer participants felt the same for Biometric-Shared (36%), Biometric-Hacked (33%), and Biometric-Brands (19%). 

Statistical comparisons revealed:
- Biometric-Leaves was rated as significantly more secure than Biometric-Shared (p = .004), Biometric-Hacked (p < .001), and Biometric-Brands (p < .001).
- Biometric-Stored was rated as significantly more secure than Biometric-Shared (p = .006), Biometric-Hacked (p < .001), and Biometric-Brands (p < .001).
- Both Biometric-Shared (p < .001) and Biometric-Hacked (p < .001) were rated as significantly more secure than Biometric-Brands.

#### Ease of Use Impressions
As shown in Figure 6b, responses to "how easy do you expect it to be to create an account at ExampleTech?" also varied across notifications (Friedman’s χ²(4) = 54.5, p < .001).
