of 95.0, which did not vary signiﬁcantly across conditions.
Participants assigned to make an ExampleTech-speciﬁc
password were less successful at authenticating than partic-
ipants who used biometric WebAuthn. In our omnibus test,
the proportion of participants who successfully authenticated
varied across conditions (FET, p < .001). Whereas only 76%
of Password participants successfully authenticated, 93% of
Non-biometric participants and 95%–100% of participants in
the six biometric conditions did so. In pairwise, post-hoc con-
trasts, we found that the difference between all six biometric
conditions and Password was either signiﬁcant or marginally
signiﬁcant (FET, .030 ≤ p ≤ .086 for all six comparisons).
The 10 Password participants who were unable to log in
reported forgetting their password.
5.4 Overall Perceptions of Security/Usability
Participants responded on a Likert scale to broad statements
about the security, privacy, and easiness of the process of creat-
ing an account. We found that the authentication mechanism,
and to a lesser extent the biometric WebAuthn notiﬁcation
shown, impacted perceptions of security and privacy.
As shown in Figure 5b, the distribution of responses to the
statement “I think account creation at ExampleTech is secure”
varied across conditions (KW χ2(7) = 29.4, p < .001). In
each of the six biometric conditions, at least 60% of partici-
pants strongly or somewhat agreed with this statement. At the
high end, 82% of Biometric-Shared and 78% of Biometric-
Hacked participants strongly or somewhat agreed. In contrast,
only 38% of Non-biometric participants strongly or some-
what agreed. For Password, this number was 57%. Agree-
ment that account creation is secure was signiﬁcantly higher
for Biometric-Shared than for Non-biometric (p < .001) and
Password (p = .003), while the difference with Biometric-
Stored was marginally signiﬁcant (p = .084). Similarly, agree-
ment was signiﬁcantly higher for Biometric-Hacked than Non-
biometric (p < .001) and Password (p = .009). It was also sig-
niﬁcantly higher for Biometric-Brands than for Non-biometric
(p = .020), and marginal compared to Password (p = .080).
Finally, agreement for Biometric-Control was signiﬁcantly
higher than for Non-biometric (p = .043), as well as marginal
for Biometric-Leaves compared to Non-biometric (p = .080).
Across biometric groups, the most common justiﬁcation for
perceiving registration as secure was the general fact that
they used biometrics (20% of participants). For example, P56
wrote, “Biometrics are usually pretty reliable.”
Responses to “I think account creation at ExampleTech
protects the privacy of my ﬁngerprint/PIN/. . . ” also varied
by condition (KW χ2(7) = 17.1, p = 0.025), as shown in
Figure 5a. Agreement was signiﬁcantly higher for Biometric-
Shared than for Non-biometric (p = 0.025) and Password
(p = 0.025). Whereas 64% of Biometric-Shared participants
felt their data was kept private, only 35% and 32% of Non-
biometric and Password participants, respectively, thought
so. No other contrasts were signiﬁcant. In free-text justiﬁ-
cations, 33 participants wrote that their assigned mechanism
protects their privacy because the biometric stays on their
phone. Of those participants, 24% saw Biometric-Shared,
24% saw Biometric-Stored, and 30% saw Biometric-Leaves.
In all conditions, participants found account creation easy.
Across conditions, 89% of participants “strongly” agreed, and
9% “somewhat” agreed with the statement “I think account
creation at ExampleTech is easy.” Figure 5d shows these re-
sponses, which did not vary signiﬁcantly by condition. The
primary justiﬁcation for perceiving WebAuthn as easy was
that it was fast. Several participants in the biometric groups
also noted that there was no need to remember passwords. For
example, P163 wrote, “I don’t have to remember any pass-

words and I don’t have to worry about losing the password.”
These results were echoed in the authentication phase.
In the second part of the study, we asked similar questions
about whether sign-in was secure and easy. As shown in
Figure 5c, perceptions of security again varied by condition
(KW χ2(7) = 34.0, p < .001). Agreement was signiﬁcantly
higher in all six biometric conditions than in Non-biometric
(all p ≤ .031). It was also signiﬁcantly higher in all six bio-
metric conditions than in Password (all p ≤ .040). Whereas
60% of Non-biometric participants and 63% of Password
participants “somewhat” or “strongly” agreed, the same was
true for 78%–93% of participants in the biometric condi-
tions. As shown in Figure 5e, perceptions that sign-in was
easy also varied by condition (KW χ2(7) = 21.8, p = 0.008).
Non-biometric participants rated sign-in as signiﬁcantly less
easy than Biometric-Control (p = .044), Biometric-Hacked
(p = .045), Biometric-Shared (p = .045), or Biometric-Stored
(p = .044). 40% of biometric participants, but only 7% of
those in Password, said sign-in was easy because it was fast.
5.5 Security Misconceptions
Storage Location: To quantify participants’ mental models
about where data about their biometric or non-biometric fall-
back (e.g., PIN) is stored when using WebAuthn, we asked a
multiple-choice question: “From the list below, where do you
think your chosen biometric/fallback secret (or data derived
from it) is stored when you created an account at Example-
Tech? Select all that apply.” Based on the misconceptions
observed in Study 1, we provided the following options: “on
my phone”; “on ExampleTech’s computers”; “on your phone
manufacturer’s computers”; “on the computers of a third-
party that handles the login process”; “on the computers of
another third-party”; and a ﬁll-in-the-blank “other.”
In WebAuthn, the biometric is stored only on the phone,
a design decision that is critical for users’ privacy. Unfortu-
nately, only 40% of participants across the 7 WebAuthn con-
ditions correctly chose only “on my phone” for where their
biometric or non-biometric fallback secret is stored. While
55% of Biometric-Stored and 50% of Biometric-Leaves par-
ticipants chose only “on my phone,” compared to between
33% and 39% in the ﬁve other conditions, these differences
were not statistically signiﬁcant (KW χ2(6) = 7.7, p = 0.265).
22% incorrectly chose that the data is stored only on Example-
Tech’s computers, 10% chose that it is stored in both of those
places, and 7% incorrectly chose that the data is stored “on
the computers of a third-party that handles the login process.”
We asked a parallel question about where data is stored
for unlocking a phone. In stark contrast, 71% of participants
across the seven WebAuthn conditions correctly chose only
“on my phone” for where their data is stored for unlocking
their phone. Even though the actual storage location is iden-
tical, far more participants had misconceptions about where
their data is stored in WebAuthn than in phone unlocking.
Other misconceptions followed from misunderstandings
about biometric storage. We asked, “Do you expect a member
of our research team who maintains the ExampleTech website
to have access to your biometric data?” 15% of participants
incorrectly answered “probably” or “deﬁnitely yes,” mostly
because they thought data is stored in ExampleTech’s database
or that employee access to the data is needed for maintenance
reasons. Interestingly, participants in all biometric conditions
except Biometric-Leaves and Biometric-Stored wrote that
biometric data does not have any value to employees or that
employees have no reason to access it.
Processing of Biometric Data: We asked participants
to respond to: “If an attacker stole data from the Example-
Tech database, do you think the attacker would have your ﬁn-
gerprint/PIN/. . . ?” Responses varied across conditions (KW
χ2(7) = 41.1, p < .001). 43% of Non-biometric partici-
pants incorrectly believed attackers could “probably” or “deﬁ-
nitely” get their non-biometric mechanism for unlocking their
phone. In contrast, no more than 20% of participants in any
of the six biometric conditions incorrectly believed the at-
tacker could “probably” or “deﬁnitely” get their biometric.
These differences were statistically signiﬁcant between Non-
biometric and all six biometric conditions (all p ≤ .020), as
well as between Password and all six biometric conditions (all
p ≤ .005). Assumptions that biometric data is stored securely
or encrypted was the primary reason participants gave as to
why an attacker would not have access. In contrast, other
participants thought hackers could gain access because they
are highly skilled. However, all of these participants missed
the key point that the website does not store biometrics at all.

and 39% (Biometric-Leaves) of participants incorrectly
thought their biometrics or data derived from them were sent
to a third party for processing. That a conﬁrmation or vaguely
deﬁned “login token” is sent by the third-party service upon
successful authentication was mentioned by between 12%
and 20% of participants per biometric condition. In contrast,
14% of Biometric-Leaves participants (far more than in any
other group) correctly noted that no biometric data is sent.
Lost Phones: Next, we asked if someone who found a lost
phone could access the participant’s account. Responses var-
ied by condition (KW χ2(7) = 54.6, p < .001). Whereas at
most 10% of participants in any biometric condition answered
“probably” or “deﬁnitely” yes, 41% of Password and 15% of
Non-biometric participants gave those answers. Agreement
was signiﬁcantly higher for Password and Non-biometric com-
pared to all six biometric conditions (all p < .001 and all
p ≤ .036, respectively). Biometric participants’ free-text jus-
tiﬁcations emphasized that someone who found their phone
would not have their biometric. Other participants mentioned
biometrics’ inherent security “features,” such as their unique-
ness or difﬁculty to fake. Only 7 participants across all bio-
metric groups correctly noted that attackers could, in fact, just
use the device’s fallback PIN, pattern, or password.
Cross-Site Usage: We also investigated whether partici-
pants thought an employee of a trustworthy/untrustworthy
website where the participant is also registered could access
their account at ExampleTech. 48% of Password participants
expected an untrustworthy site could leverage their password
to sign into other sites, which is the case if the user reuses
passwords across sites. In contrast, 40% of Non-biometric
participants and up to 39% of participants in each biometric
condition incorrectly also thought they were putting them-
selves at risk. We asked a parallel question, replacing “un-
trustworthy website” with “companies, such as eBay, Google,
and Microsoft.” Only 15% of participants answered “probably
yes” or “deﬁnitely yes,” highlighting the need for further edu-
cation that WebAuthn can be used safely even on potentially
untrustworthy websites.
5.6 Usability Misconceptions
Availability: Only 38% of participants across the six biomet-
ric conditions correctly realized they could sign into their
account even if the scanner failed to read their biometric; 46%
incorrectly thought they would be unable to do so. Most
commonly, incorrect free-text justiﬁcations suggested that
participants were unaware that biometric WebAuthn always
has a non-biometric fallback. Other participants assumed
they could use classic reset mechanisms like email recovery
or calling a website’s service hotline.
Multiple Devices: Among participants, 34% thought they
“probably” or “deﬁnitely” could log into ExampleTech via
WebAuthn while using a different device (e.g., a friend’s
phone), while another 17% were unsure. Most participants
who thought they could log in from another device incorrectly
assumed their biometric was stored by ExampleTech. A few,
however, chose this answer, (correctly) realizing that they
could register a separate account on another device.
Delegating Access: Asked if they think a friend or family
member could sign into the participant’s account with their
permission, 10% or fewer of the participants in any biometric
condition answered “probably” or “deﬁnitely yes.” This result
emphasizes that the vast majority of participants were un-
aware that they could share their phone and its non-biometric
fallback method (e.g., the phone’s unlock PIN) to delegate
access. While we found no signiﬁcant differences across
biometric conditions, perceptions did vary across conditions
(KW χ2(7) = 107.4, p < .001). Speciﬁcally, most partici-
pants in Password (52%) and Non-biometric (60%) realized
they could delegate access, which is signiﬁcantly higher than
in any biometric group (all p < .001).
5.7 Comparison of Notiﬁcations
To further understand what the notiﬁcations we designed
based on Study 2 communicated, we asked a series of ques-
tions to all biometric participants about the ﬁve notiﬁcations
other than Biometric-Control. Here, condition names refer
only to the notiﬁcation; every biometric participant saw every
notiﬁcation in a randomized order in a within-subjects design.
An overview of the results is given in Figure 6.
The notiﬁcations created varied impressions. As shown
in Figure 6a, responses to “how secure would you feel us-
ing your ﬁngerprint or face to create an account at Example-
Tech?” varied across notiﬁcations (Friedman χ2(4) = 196.6,
p < .001). Among participants, 51% reported they would
feel “extremely secure” after viewing Biometric-Leaves; 50%
reported the same after viewing Biometric-Stored. In con-
trast, fewer participants felt the same for Biometric-Shared
(36%), Biometric-Hacked (33%), and Biometric-Brands
(19%). Biometric-Leaves was rated as signiﬁcantly more
secure than Biometric-Shared (p = .004), Biometric-Hacked
(p < .001), and Biometric-Brands (p < .001). Similarly,
Biometric-Stored was rated as signiﬁcantly more secure than
Biometric-Shared (p = .006), Biometric-Hacked (p < .001),
and Biometric-Brands (p < .001). Participants also felt signif-
icantly more secure for both Biometric-Shared (p < .001) and
Biometric-Hacked (p < .001) compared to Biometric-Brands.
As shown in Figure 6b, responses to “how easy do you
expect it to be to create an account at ExampleTech?” also var-
ied across notiﬁcations (Friedman’s χ2(4) = 54.5, p < .001).
