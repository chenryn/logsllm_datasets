If the metric name/expression is the same as the SORT BY metric, the SORT BY
metric is re-added to the SELECT clause (necessary for sorting) which results
in selecting the expression twice which then introduces ambiguity resulting in
the query engine returning an error.
### Expected results
The SORT BY metric should not be re-added to the SELECT clause.
### Actual results
Depending on the engine an error may be thrown, i.e., for Presto:
    line 65:10: Column 'sum(total)' is ambiguous
#### Screenshots
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
#### How to reproduce the bug
  1. Go to explorer.
  2. Add a metric to both the `METRICS` section (chart dependent) and `SORT BY`.
  3. Select a `GROUP BY`.
  4. Click `RUN`.
  5. Possibly see the error and notice that the metric is duplicated in the SQL, i.e.,
    SELECT 
        ...
        sum("total") AS "SUM(total)",
        sum("total") AS "SUM(total)"
### Environment
(please complete the following information):
  * superset version: `master`
  * python version: `3.7`
  * node.js version: `node -v`
