User:  How do I set up remote access to carry information? Please explain the differences and features of SSH and Telnet.
Assistant: 1. How to set up remote access to carried information? During remote access, you can set the carrying information through command line parameters or configuration files when connecting. The specific setting methods are as follows: - SSH: Specify the private key file path by using the -i parameter when connecting, or specify the private key file path by setting the IdentityFile option in the client configuration file. - Telnet: The Telnet protocol itself does not support encryption, so information such as private keys cannot be set. 2. Differences and features of SSH and Telnet Both SSH and Telnet are protocols for remote access, but they differ in security and functions. The main differences are as follows: - Security: SSH uses encrypted communication and can encrypt data transmission to prevent eavesdropping and tampering, so it is relatively safe; while Telnet does not encrypt data transmission and is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. - Function: SSH supports many functions, such as authentication, remote file transfer, port forwarding, etc.; Telnet function is relatively simple and only supports basic remote terminal sessions. - Supportability: SSH has become the standard configuration of modern servers, while Telnet is gradually abandoned on modern servers, and its main purpose is to be compatible with old legacy systems. - Transmission speed: Since SSH encrypts the data, the data processing time will be relatively slow. Overall, SSH is more secure and feature-rich than Telnet.
