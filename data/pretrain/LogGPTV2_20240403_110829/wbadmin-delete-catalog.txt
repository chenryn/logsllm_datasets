### wbadmin delete catalog

**Description:**
The `wbadmin delete catalog` command removes the backup catalog stored on the local computer. This command should be used when the backup catalog is corrupted and cannot be restored using the `wbadmin restore catalog` command.

**Prerequisites:**
- You must be a member of the Backup Operators group or the Administrators group, or you must have been delegated the appropriate permissions.
- You must run `wbadmin` from an elevated command prompt. To do this, right-click on Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator."

**Syntax:**
```shell
wbadmin delete catalog [-quiet]
```

**Parameters:**
- **-quiet**: Runs the command without prompting the user for confirmation.

**Remarks:**
- Deleting the backup catalog will prevent you from accessing any backups created for that computer using the Windows Server Backup snap-in.
- If you have access to another backup location, you can restore the backup catalog by running the `wbadmin restore catalog` command from that location.
- We strongly recommend creating a new backup after deleting the backup catalog to ensure data protection.

By following these steps and considerations, you can effectively manage and recover your backup catalog in case of corruption.
