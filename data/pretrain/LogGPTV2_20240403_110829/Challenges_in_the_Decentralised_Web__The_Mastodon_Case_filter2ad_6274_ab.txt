### Data Collection and Network Construction

We collected data on all public users across each instance by paginating through their HTML follower lists. This process allowed us to construct ego networks for each user. Each user is identified by their account name on a per-instance basis, as users must create a separate account for each instance. Our analysis revealed that 87.9% of account names are unique to a single instance, 8.3% are present on two instances, and 3.8% are found on three or more. It is important to note that we cannot determine if these accounts are owned by the same individual, so we treat them as separate nodes.

Next, we constructed a directed graph \( G(V, E) \), where a directed edge from user \( V_i \) to user \( V_j \) indicates that \( V_i \) follows \( V_j \). This resulted in a network of 853,000 user accounts and 9.25 million follower links. Conceptually, this graph is similar to the Twitter follower graph, but with a key difference: Mastodon allows users to follow accounts on remote instances, necessitating federated subscriptions between instances. To capture this, we created a second graph, \( G_F(I, E) \), which represents the instance-to-instance subscriptions (referred to as the instance federation graph). In \( G_F \), a directed edge exists between instances \( I_a \) and \( I_b \) if at least one user on \( I_a \) follows a user on \( I_b \).

### Comparison with Twitter

For comparative purposes, we also gathered historical data on Twitter's outages and social network, dating back to when Twitter was approximately 1.5 years old, similar to Mastodon's current age. We used pingdom.com, a widely used website monitoring platform, to obtain uptime statistics for Twitter, which probed the site every minute from February to December 2007. The data was sourced from the Internet Archive. Additionally, we obtained the Twitter social graph from a 2011 dataset, which includes users and their respective follower networks.

### Limitations

Our analysis reveals a highly dynamic system, making our measurements akin to capturing a "moving target." The timelines of our datasets differ slightly due to the progressive deployment of our measurement infrastructure, but this does not affect our subsequent analysis. We do not have comprehensive data on all toots, as some instances prevent crawling (we have 62% of toots). Therefore, we avoid deep semantic analysis of toot content and focus on instance-level activities.

### Ethical Considerations

The instances dataset contains only public infrastructure information, while the toots dataset includes user information, which may raise privacy concerns. However, we have exclusively collected public toot data, adhered to established ethical procedures for social data, and obtained a waiver from the ethics committee at Queen Mary University of London. All data is anonymized before use, stored securely, and text content has been removed from our analysis. Our public dataset only includes infrastructure information and anonymized toot metadata.

### Exploring Instances

#### Instance Popularity

We first quantified the growth and popularity of the 4,328 instances under study and examined how this relates to instance settings.

**Instance Growth:**
Figure 1 shows the time series of the number of instances, users, and toots available per day. Mastodon experienced a period of growing popularity, with fluctuations driven by the arrival and departure of instances. Between April and June 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of instances and users. By July 2017, the number of instances plateaued, with only 6% of instances set up between July and December 2017. However, the user population continued to grow by 22% during this period. In the first half of 2018, new instances began to appear again, growing by 43%. This growth may have been influenced by campaigns like #DeleteFacebook and sporadic media attention. Closer inspection reveals fluctuations in the instance population, driven by short periods of unavailability.

**Open vs. Closed Instances:**
Mastodon instances can be categorized into open (allowing anyone to register, 47.8% of instances) and closed (requiring an explicit invitation, 52.2%). Figure 2(a) presents a CDF of the number of users and toots per instance, separated into open and closed instances. The user population distribution is highly skewed, with the top 5% of instances hosting 90.6% of all users. Similar patterns are observed in toot generation, with the top 5% of instances accumulating 94.8% of toots. Open instances have substantially more users (mean 613 vs. 87 for closed instances), but closed instances generate more toots per capita (average of 186.65 vs. 94.8 for open instances). Figure 2(c) shows the CDFs of the activity level per instance, confirming that closed instances have more engaged populations, with a median of 75% active users compared to 50% for open instances.

#### Instance Categories

To improve visibility and specialization, instances can tag themselves with categories and specify allowed activities. Overall, 697 out of 4,328 instances report a self-declared category, with 13.6% of users and 14.4% of toots associated with these categorized instances. 51.7% of these categories are labeled as "generic."

**Category Tags:**
Figure 3 plots the distribution of instances, toots, and users across each category. The majority of instances are categorized as tech (55.2%), games (37.3%), or art (30.15%). While tech covers 55.2% of instances, it only garners 20.8% of users and 24.5% of toots. Games, on the other hand, correspond to 37.3% of instances but generate 43.43% of all toots, indicating high activity. Adult instances constitute only 12.3% of instances but attract 61.03% of all users, suggesting that adult content is a highly popular topic served by a small set of instances.

**Activity Tags:**
Out of the 697 instances, 17.5% allow all types of activity, while the remaining instances specify acceptable and prohibited activities. 82% list at least one prohibited activity, and 93% specify at least one acceptable activity. The most commonly prohibited activities are spam (76%), pornography (66%), and nudity (62%). Some instances explicitly allow these activities, but they generally have fewer users. In contrast, instances allowing advertising have disproportionately large user groups (47% of instances, 61% of users, and 75% of toots).

#### Instance Hosting

Unlike centrally administered deployments, Mastodon's infrastructure follows a bottom-up approach, with administrators independently deciding where to place their instances. Figure 5 breaks down the presence of instances, toots, and users across countries and Autonomous Systems (ASes).

**Countries:**
Japan hosts the largest number of instances, users, and toots, with 25.5% of all instances, followed by the US with 21.4%. The ratio of instances to users varies across countries. For example, Japan hosts a quarter of instances but gains 41% of all users, while France hosts 16% of instances but only 9.2% of users. Figure 6 presents a Sankey diagram showing the interdependency of instances across countries, with users on one instance often following users on instances in the same country.

#### Instance Availability

We explored the availability properties of the bottom-up deployment, defining availability as the ability to access and download the homepage. We measured the historical availability of 4,300 instances over 15 months, counting outages where an instance becomes unavailable and then returns. Figure 7 plots the distribution of downtime, showing that about half of the instances have less than 5% downtime, with 4.5% of instances being up 99.5% of the time. However, 11% of instances are inaccessible more than half of the time, indicating that failures are relatively common. We also counted the number of toots and users unavailable during instance failures, finding that failures occur across the spectrum of popularity, including instances hosting over 100,000 toots.
