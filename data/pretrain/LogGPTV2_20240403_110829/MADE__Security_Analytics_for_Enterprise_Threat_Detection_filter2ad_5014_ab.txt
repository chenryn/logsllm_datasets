### Variants by Similarity with Existing Samples

Traditional methods for detecting malware often rely on identifying variants by their similarity to existing samples. However, these methods are not designed to detect new, previously unseen malware. Oprea et al. [47] apply belief propagation to detect periodic communication and malware delivery in multi-stage campaigns. Bartos et al. [11] design a system for generic malware detection that classifies legitimate and malicious web flows using lexical, URL, and inter-arrival timing features. They propose a feature representation invariant to changes in malware behavior, but this method sacrifices feature interpretability. BAYWATCH [30] uses supervised learning based on inter-arrival timing and lexical features to detect periodic Command and Control (C&C) or beaconing communication.

### MADE: A Comprehensive Malware Detection System

MADE (Malware Detection and Evaluation) is a system designed to identify HTTP malware communication in enterprise networks. It has several key characteristics:

1. **Extensive Feature Set**: MADE uses the most comprehensive set of features to date, carefully crafted based on Security Operations Center (SOC) domain expertise.
2. **Versatile Malware Identification**: Unlike systems that rely on timing or lexical features, MADE can identify various malware classes.
3. **High Precision**: MADE achieves the best precision among prioritization-based systems, even at similar false positive rates.
4. **Detection of New Malware**: MADE can identify new malware not available during training and unknown to the community at the time of detection.
5. **Interpretability**: The results from MADE are interpretable, making it useful for SOC domain experts.

### Comparison with Existing Systems

Previous systems are tailored for specific types of malware communication protocols, such as those with periodic timing [30, 47] or those similar to known malware [11, 45]. Therefore, there is no existing system with which we can meaningfully compare the results achieved by MADE. We hope the community will create benchmarks, including datasets and algorithms, to facilitate such comparisons.

### Ethical Considerations

The enterprise SOC provided us access to four months of data from their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Employees consented to their web traffic being monitored while working within the enterprise perimeter. Our dataset did not include any personally identifiable information (PII). The analysis was conducted on enterprise servers, and we only exported aggregated web traffic features (as described in Table 3).

### Training Data and Methodology

We obtained access to the enterprise SIEM for a four-month period in February-March and July-August 2015. The raw logs contain an average of 300 million events per day, resulting in about 24TB of data per month. We used one month of data (July) for training and one month (August) for testing. To augment the set of malicious domains, we extracted additional malicious connections from February and March data, which we included in the training set.

Each domain is represented by a set of numerical and categorical features extracted from different categories. We express our problem in terms of machine learning (ML) terminology. Let \( D_{\text{tr}} = \{(x_1, L_1), \ldots, (x_n, L_n)\} \) be the training set, where domain \( i \) has feature set \( x_i \) and label \( L_i \in \{M, B, U\} \). Our goal is to train an ML model \( f \in H \), where \( H \) is the hypothesis space defined as the set of all functions from domain representations \( X \) to predictions \( Y \). The model \( f \) is selected to minimize a certain loss function on the training set:
\[ \min_{f \in H} \sum_{i=1}^n \ell(f(x_i, L_i, \theta)) + \lambda \omega(\theta) \]
where \( \theta \) is the model parameter, and \( \lambda \omega(\theta) \) is a regularization term.

### Data Filtering and Labeling

For each external domain contacted by an enterprise machine, the web proxy logs include connection timestamp, IP addresses and ports of the source and destination, full URL visited, HTTP method, bytes sent and received, status code, user-agent string, web referer, and content type. The enterprise maintains the first date each fully qualified domain name (FQDN) was observed on the network. During July and August, a total of 3.8 million distinct FQDNs were included in the proxy logs. We applied several filters to restrict our attention to potential domains of interest related to malware communications:

- **Recent Domains**: We focus on recent domains appearing for the first time on the enterprise in the last two weeks. This is motivated by the short lifetime of malicious domains, the likelihood of long-lived malicious domains being included in threat intelligence services, and our interest in new malware trends.
- **Popular Domains**: We exclude popular domains contacted by more than 50 enterprise hosts per day, as most enterprise infections compromise a few hosts, and large-scale compromises can be detected by perimeter defenses and other tools.
- **CDN Domains**: We filter out domains hosted by reputable Content Delivery Network (CDN) services, as they are generally considered safe. However, recent research has shown that adversaries may use CDN domains to deliver potentially unwanted programs (PUPs).
- **Legitimate Advertisement Traffic**: We exclude reputable advertisement domains based on EasyList [4] and EasyPrivacy [5], as malicious advertisements usually originate from lower-reputation ad networks.
- **Domains with Few Connections**: We target domains with at least 5 connections over a one-month period, as most C&C domains see more traffic.

After filtering, there were a total of 471K distinct FQDNs contacted in July and August.

**Data Labeling**:
- **Benign Domains**: Domains with their second-level domain in the top 10K Alexa (6.57% of training and 7.2% of testing domains) are labeled as benign.
- **Malicious Domains**: Domains flagged by at least three anti-virus engines in VirusTotal are labeled as malicious.
- **Unknown Domains**: Domains with a score of 0 on VirusTotal that are not already labeled as benign are considered unknown.

### Feature Extraction

We used a large set of 89 features for representing FQDN domains in our dataset. These features are grouped into internal and external categories:

#### Internal Features
- **Communication Structure**: Features about the number of connections, bytes sent and received, and POST/GET requests.
- **Domain Structure**: Features such as TLD, domain levels, and sub-domains.
- **URL Features**: Features derived from URL path, folder, file name, extension, parameters, and fragment fields.

#### External Features
- **Registration and Geolocation**: Features related to domain registration age, update age, and IP geolocation.

### Conclusion

MADE is a robust and versatile system for detecting HTTP malware communication in enterprise networks. By leveraging a comprehensive set of features and advanced machine learning techniques, MADE can identify and prioritize suspicious domains, providing valuable insights for SOC domain experts. Future work includes creating benchmarks and further refining the system to address emerging threats.
