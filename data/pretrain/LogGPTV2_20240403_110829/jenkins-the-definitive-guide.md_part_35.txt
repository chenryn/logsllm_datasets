### Managing Jenkins Build History and Disk Usage

#### 1. Discarding Old Builds
Jenkins allows you to manage the build history by discarding old builds, which can help in conserving disk space. You can configure this by checking the "Discard Old Builds" checkbox at the top of the project configuration page (see Figure 13.1, “Discarding Old Builds”).

- **Build Retention Policy**: 
  - **By Number**: You can specify a maximum number of builds to keep (e.g., no more than 20 builds).
  - **By Date**: You can set a retention period (e.g., builds no older than 30 days).

- **Intelligent Retention**:
  - Jenkins ensures that at least the latest successful build is always retained, even if it exceeds the specified number or date. This prevents the loss of the most recent working build.

- **Impact on Build Metrics**:
  - Limiting the number of builds can reduce the amount of historical data available for generating graphs and metrics. For example, if you limit the builds to 20, Jenkins will only display the last 20 data points, which might be insufficient for long-term analysis.

- **Advanced Options**:
  - By clicking the "Advanced..." button, you can discard build artifacts (e.g., JAR, WAR files) while retaining the build history (XML log files). This helps in reducing disk usage without losing important build metrics.
  - For instance, you can configure Jenkins to keep artifacts for a maximum of 7 days (see Figure 13.2, “Discarding Old Builds—Advanced Options”).

- **Marking Important Builds**:
  - You can mark specific builds as "Keep this log forever" to ensure they are not automatically discarded.

#### 2. Using the Disk Usage Plugin
The Disk Usage plugin is a valuable tool for monitoring and managing disk space used by Jenkins projects.

- **Installation**:
  - Install the Disk Usage plugin from the Plugin Manager screen. After installation and a Jenkins restart, the plugin will record and report disk usage.

- **Disk Usage Overview**:
  - The plugin adds a "Disk Usage" link on the Manage Jenkins screen, displaying the overall disk usage for your projects (see Figure 13.3, “Viewing Disk Usage”).
  - The list is sorted by overall disk usage, with two values for each project: "Builds" (total space used by build history) and "Workspace" (space used to build the project).

- **Monitoring Disk Usage Over Time**:
  - Activate the plugin in the System Configuration screen to track disk usage over time (see Figure 13.4, “Displaying Disk Usage for a Project”).
  - The plugin provides a graph of disk usage over time (see Figure 13.5, “Displaying Project Disk Usage Over Time”), helping you understand the rate of disk space consumption.

#### 3. Disk Usage and Maven Projects
For Jenkins Maven build jobs, there are additional considerations:

- **Automatic Artifact Archiving**:
  - By default, Jenkins archives Maven build artifacts, which can consume significant disk space, especially for active projects with frequent builds.
  - To disable automatic artifact archiving, go to the "Build" section of the build job configuration screen and click the "Advanced" button. Check the "Disable automatic artifact archiving" option (see Figure 13.6, “Maven Build Jobs—Advanced Options”).

- **Alternative Solutions**:
  - Consider deploying Maven SNAPSHOT artifacts directly to a local repository manager like Nexus Pro or Artifactory, which can be configured to delete old snapshots.

#### 4. Monitoring Server Load
Jenkins provides built-in tools to monitor server activity and load.

- **Load Statistics**:
  - Access the Load Statistics from the Manage Jenkins screen. The graph tracks three metrics: total executors, busy executors, and queue length (see Figure 13.7, “Jenkins Load Statistics”).
  - Total executors include both master and slave nodes, while busy executors show the number of occupied executors. Queue length indicates the number of pending build jobs.

- **Monitoring Plugin**:
  - Install the Monitoring plugin for comprehensive reports on CPU, system load, response time, and memory usage (see Figure 13.8, “The Jenkins Monitoring Plugin”).
  - Access the JavaMelody graphs from the Manage Jenkins screen using the “Monitoring of Jenkins/Jenkins master” or “Jenkins/Jenkins nodes” menu entries.

#### 5. Backing Up Your Configuration
Regular backups are essential for data protection. Here are some methods to back up your Jenkins configuration:

- **Basic Backup**:
  - Periodically back up the `JENKINS_HOME` directory, which contains all build job configurations, slave node configurations, and build history.
  - Exclude unnecessary directories like `$JENKINS_HOME/war`, `$JENKINS_HOME/cache`, and `$JENKINS_HOME/tools` to save space.

- **Selective Backup**:
  - Understand the structure of the `JENKINS_HOME/jobs` directory to optimize backups. Focus on backing up the `builds` directory, which contains build history and artifacts (see Figure 13.9, “The Builds Directory”).
  - Test your backup by extracting it into a temporary directory and running Jenkins against it.

- **Backup Plugins**:
  - **Backup Manager Plugin**: Provides a user interface for configuring and running backups. You can choose to back up XML configuration files, build history, and Maven artifacts (see Figure 13.10, “The Jenkins Backup Manager Plugin” and Figure 13.11, “Configuring the Jenkins Backup Manager”).
  - **Thin Backup Plugin**: Schedules full and incremental backups of configuration files, excluding build history and artifacts. Configuration is straightforward (see Figure 13.12, “Configuring the Thin Backup Plugin” and Figure 13.13, “Restoring a Previous Configuration”).

#### 6. Archiving Build Jobs
Archiving inactive projects can help manage disk space.

- **Archiving Process**:
  - Compress the build job directory into a tarball or ZIP file.
  - Delete the original project directory and move the archive to a storage location.
  - Reload the Jenkins configuration from disk to remove the archived project from the dashboard (see Figure 13.14, “Reloading the Configuration from Disk”).

#### 7. Migrating Build Jobs
Migrating build jobs between Jenkins instances can be done by copying or moving the project directories.

- **Migration Steps**:
  - Copy or move the build job directories to the new Jenkins instance.
  - Ensure the necessary plugins are installed on the new instance.
  - Reload the configuration from disk to make the new jobs visible on the Jenkins dashboard.

- **Handling Incompatibilities**:
  - If migrating to a different Jenkins configuration, watch for warnings or exceptions in the system logs.
  - Use Jenkins’ features to manage out-of-date or invalid data (see Figure 13.15, “Jenkins Will Inform You if Your Data Is Not Compatible with the Current Version” and Figure 13.16, “Managing Out-of-Date Build Jobs Data”).

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage Jenkins' build history, disk usage, and server load, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.
