  * VSCode Version: v1.1
  * OS Version: windows 10
  * nodejs Version: v6
Steps to Reproduce:  
( a little bit complicate)
  1. mkdir try-bugs && cd try-bugs  
2.npm install -g vue-cli  
2.vue init webpack  
3.npm install  
4.set up a task in task.json, whose command is `npm`, args is `["run",
"build"]`
  2. press `contrl + shift + b` to build the project  
6.then babel of webpack does not work in the right way

Further description and guess:  
I have install a extension of vscode called new-cmd , which can enable you to
open a new terminal from current work space directory by typing command `cmd`
after pressing `f1` in vscode.  
If I open a terminal using this extension and then run `npm run build` in this
terminal, it will show me the same bug as run the build task from vscode.

However, if I open a terminal manually by right click and run the same
command, everything goes well.

I notice that there is one difference between the two terminal is that the
disk name. The disk name in former terminal is `d:\` while the later one is
`D:\`.  
In the project, from one hand, there are some code, the config of webpack
specifically, related to `path.join(__dirname, ...)`, which will generate an
absolute path to files begin with `D:\`. From the other hand, there are some
other code use relative path to locate file, which will result in path to file
begin with `d:\`.  
I wonder whether this caused my problem or not.  
By the way, if I repeat the process with node5, the bug disappear.
