Figure 1-15: Android Virtual Device Manager
24 Chapter 1
We’ll create three Android emulators based on Android 4.3, 2.2,
and 2.1, as shown in Figure 1-16. Use the values shown in the figure for
each emulator but set the value of Target to the Android version of the
emulator you would like to build (the Google API versions of Android 4.3
[Google APIs version 18], 2.2 [Google APIs version 8], and 2.1 [Google
APIs version 7]). Fill the AVD Name field with a descriptive value. Add a
small SD Card value (100MB should be more than sufficient) so you can
download files to your Android emulators. Set Device to Nexus 4 and Skin
to Skin with dynamic hardware controls. Leave the rest of the options at
their defaults.
Figure 1-16: Creating an Android emulator
Once you’ve built all three emulators, your AVD Manager should look
like Figure 1-17 (device names may be different of course).

Figure 1-17: Android emulators created in Android Virtual Device Manager
To start an emulator, highlight it and click Start. Then click Launch in
the pop-up, as shown in Figure 1-18.
Figure 1-18: Launching an Android emulator
It may take a few minutes for the emulator to boot up for the first time,
but once it does, you should have something that looks and feels much like
a real Android device. The Android 4.3 emulator is shown in Figure 1-19.

Figure 1-19: Android 4.3 emulator
note To run the Android emulators in Kali, you will likely need to increase the perfor-
mance of your virtual machine by increasing its RAM and CPU cores. I am able to
run all three emulators with 3GB RAM and two CPU cores allocated to Kali. You
can make these changes in the virtual machine settings in your VMware product. The
amount of power you can give to Kali will, of course, depend on the resources avail-
able on your host machine. As an alternative, instead of running the Android emula-
tors on Kali Linux, you can install Android and the emulators on your host system
or even another system on the local network. The exercises in Chapter 20 will work as
long as the emulators can communicate with Kali.
Smartphone Pentest Framework
Next, download and install the Smartphone Pentest Framework (SPF), which
we’ll use for mobile attacks. Use git to download the source code. Change
to the downloaded Smartphone-Pentest-Framework directory as shown here.
root@kali:~# git clone -b SPFBook https://github.com/georgiaw/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework.git
root@kali:~# cd Smartphone-Pentest-Framework
Now open the file kaliinstall in the nano text editor. The first few lines
are shown in Listing 1-5. Note the lines that refer to /root/adt-bundle-linux
-x86-20131030/sdk/tools/android. If the name of your ADT bundle folder is
different (due to the release of a subsequent version), change this value to
match the correct place where you installed the Android ADT in the previ-
ous section.

Listing 1-5: Installing Smartphone Pentest Framework
Now run the kaliinstall script, as shown here.
root@kali:~/Smartphone-Pentest-Framework# ./kaliinstall
This will set up the SPF, which we’ll use in Chapter 20.
Finally, we need to make one more change to the configuration file for
SPF. Change directories to Smartphone-Pentest-Framework/frameworkconsole
and open the file config in nano. Look for the option #LOCATION OF ANDROID
SDK. If your ADT bundle folder name has changed since the version current
at the time of this writing, change it accordingly in the line that begins with
ANDROIDSDK=.

target Virtual machines
We’ll use three custom-built target machines to simulate vulnerabilities
often found in client environments: Ubuntu 8.10, Windows XP SP3, and
Windows 7 SP1.
You’ll find a link to a torrent containing the Ubuntu virtual machine
at http://www.nostarch.com/pentesting/. The target system is compressed using
the 7-Zip archive, and 1stPentestBook?! is the password for the archive. You can
use 7-Zip programs to open the archives for all platforms. For the Windows
and Linux packages, use http://www.7-zip.org/download.html; for Mac OS, use
Ez7z at http://ez7z.en.softonic.com/mac/. The archive is ready for use as soon as
it is unzipped.
28 Chapter 1
To set up the Windows virtual machines, you’ll need to install and con-
figure Windows XP SP3 and 32-bit Windows 7 SP1. Sources for the installa-
tion media include TechNet and MSDN (the Microsoft Developer Network),
among others. (You should be able to use your Windows virtual machines
on a trial basis for 30 days without a license key.)
Creating the windows xP target
Your Windows XP target should be a base installation of Windows XP SP3
with no additional security updates. (Visit my website at http://www
.bulbsecurity.com/ for more information about finding a copy of Windows XP.)
Once you have a copy of Windows XP SP3, here’s how to install it on
Microsoft Windows or Mac OS.
VMware Player on Microsoft Windows
To install Windows XP on VMware Player for Windows:
1. Choose Create A New Virtual Machine in VMware Player and point
the New Virtual Machine Wizard to the Windows XP installation disk
or ISO image. Depending on your source disk or image, you may be
offered the option to use Easy Install (if you’re installing a version with
a license key), or you may see a yellow triangle warning, “Could not
detect which operating system is in this disc image. You will need to
specify which operating system will be installed.” In the latter case, just
press Next.
2. In the Select a Guest Operating System dialog, select Microsoft Windows
in the Guest operating system section and your version of Windows XP in
the drop-down box, as shown in Figure 1-20, and press Next.
Figure 1-20: Selecting your version of Windows XP
Setting Up Your Virtual Lab 29
3. In the next dialog, enter Bookxp XP SP3 as the name of your virtual
machine and press Next.
4. In the Specify Disk Capacity dialog, accept the recommended hard disk
size for your virtual machine of 40GB and check the box for Store vir-
tual disk as a single file, as shown in Figure 1-21, and press Next.
Figure 1-21: Specifying the disk capacity
note The Virtual Machine will not take up the entire 40GB; it will only take up space on
your hard drive as needed. This is just a maximum value.
5. In the Ready to Create Virtual Machine dialog, shown in Figure 1-22,
click Customize Hardware.
Figure 1-22: Customizing your hardware
30 Chapter 1
6. In the Hardware dialog, choose Network Adapter, and in the Network
Connection field that appears, select Bridged: Connected directly to
the physical network. Next, click Configure Adapters and select the
adapter you’re using to connect to the Internet, as shown in Figure 1-23.
Then press OK, Close, and Finish.
Figure 1-23: Configuring your network adapter as bridged
You should now be able to play your Windows XP virtual machine.
Continue to the instructions for installing and activating Windows XP
in “Installing and Activating Windows” on page 32.
VMware Fusion on Mac OS
In VMware Fusion, go to File4New4Import from disk or image
and point it to the Windows XP installation disk or image, as shown
in Figure 1-24.
Follow the prompts to create a fresh installation of Windows XP SP3.
Setting Up Your Virtual Lab 31
Figure 1-24: Creating a new virtual machine
Installing and Activating Windows
As part of the installation process, you will be prompted for a Windows
license key. If you have one, enter it here. If not, you should be able to use
the virtual machine on a trial basis for 30 days. To continue without enter-
ing a license key, click Next when prompted for the key. A pop-up will warn
you that entering a license key is recommended and ask if you would like to
enter one now, as shown in Figure 1-25. Just click No.
Figure 1-25: License key dialog
32 Chapter 1
As shown in Figure 1-26, when prompted, set Computer name to Bookxp.
Set Administrator password to password.
Figure 1-26: Setting the computer name and Administrator password
You can leave the date/time and TCP/IP settings at their defaults when
prompted. Likewise, leave the Windows XP target as part of the workgroup
WORKGROUP instead of joining it to a domain, as shown in Figure 1-27.
Figure 1-27: Workgroup settings
Setting Up Your Virtual Lab 33
Tell Windows not to automatically install security updates, as shown in
Figure 1-28. This step is important, because some of the exploits we will run
rely on missing Windows patches.
Figure 1-28: Turning off automatic security updates
You will then be prompted to activate Windows. If you entered a license
key, go ahead and activate it. Otherwise you can choose No, remind me
every few days, as shown in Figure 1-29.
Figure 1-29: Activating Windows
34 Chapter 1
Now create user accounts georgia and secret, as shown in Figure 1-30. We
will create passwords for these users after setup is finished.
Figure 1-30: Adding users
When Windows starts up, log in as the user georgia with no
password.
Installing VMware Tools
Now install VMware Tools, which will make it easier to use your virtual
machine by, for example, letting you copy/paste and drag programs onto
the virtual machine from the host system.
VMware Player on Microsoft Windows
In VMware Player, install VMware Tools from Player4Manage4Install
VMware Tools, as shown in Figure 1-31. The VMware Tools installer should
automatically run in Windows XP.

Turning Off Windows Firewall
Now open the Control Panel from the Windows Start menu. Click Security
Center4Windows Firewall to turn off the Windows Firewall, as shown in
Figure 1-33.
Figure 1-33: Turning off the Windows firewall
Setting User Passwords
Again in the Control Panel, go to User Accounts. Click the user georgia
and then select Create a password. Set georgia’s password to password, as
shown in Figure 1-34. Do the same thing for the user secret, but set secret’s
password to Password123.
Figure 1-34: Setting a user password
Setting Up Your Virtual Lab 37
Setting a Static IP Address
Next, set a static IP address so your networking information won’t change
as you work through the book. But first we need to figure out the address
of our default gateway.
Ensure that your Windows XP system is set to use bridged networking
in VMware. By default, your virtual machine will automatically pull an IP
address using DHCP.
To find the default gateway, open a Windows command prompt by
going to Start4Run, entering cmd, and clicking OK. In the command
prompt, enter ipconfig. This will show you the networking information,
including the default gateway.
C:\Documents and Settings\georgia>ipconfig
Windows IP Configuration
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:
Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : XXXXXXXX
IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.20.10
Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.20.1
C:\Documents and Settings\georgia>
In my case, the IP address is 192.168.20.10, the subnet mask is
255.255.255.0, and the default gateway is 192.168.20.1.
1. In the Control Panel, go to Network and Internet Connections and
click Network Connections at the bottom of the screen.
2. Right-click Local Area Connection and then select Properties.
3. Highlight Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and select Properties. Now
enter a static IP address and set the Subnet mask and Default gateway
to match the data you found with the ipconfig command, as shown in
Figure 1-35. Set the Preferred DNS server to your default gateway as well.
Now it’s time to see if our virtual machines can communicate. Once
you’re sure that the settings match, return to the Kali virtual machine (start
it if you had shut it down) and enter ping , as shown here.
note My IP address is 192.168.20.10. Throughout the book, you should replace this
value with the IP address of your systems.
root@kali:~# ping 192.168.20.10
PING 192.168.20.10 (192.168.20.10) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 192.168.20.10: icmp_req=1 ttl=128 time=3.06 ms
^C
38 Chapter 1
Figure 1-35: Setting a static IP address
Enter ctrl-C to stop the ping command. If you see output beginning
with 64 bytes from , as shown previously, your virtual
machines are able to communicate. Congratulations! You’ve set up a net-
work of virtual machines.
If instead you see a message including the text Destination Host
Unreachable, troubleshoot your networking: Make sure your virtual
machines are on the same bridged virtual network, check that your
default gateway is correct, and so on.
Making XP Act Like It’s a Member of a Windows Domain
Finally, we need to modify a setting in Windows XP so that it will behave as
if it were a member of a Windows domain, as many of your clients will be.
I’m not having you set up an entire Windows domain here, but during post
exploitation, a couple of exercises will simulate a domain environment.
Return to your XP virtual machine and follow these steps.
1. Select Start4Run and enter secpol.msc to open the Local Security
Settings panel.
2. Expand Local Policies on the left and double-click Security Options
on the right.
3. In the Policy list in the pane on the right, double-click Network access:
Sharing and security model for local accounts and choose Classic
- local users authenticate as themselves from the drop-down list, as
shown in Figure 1-36.
Setting Up Your Virtual Lab 39

4. Click Apply and then OK.
5. Close any open windows in your virtual machine.
Installing Vulnerable Software
In this section we’ll install some vulnerable software on our Windows XP
virtual machine. We’ll be attacking this software in later chapters. Open
your Windows XP virtual machine and, while still logged in as user georgia,
