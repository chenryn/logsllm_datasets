Exploitable Assumptions

What the hell is a Hacker?
What the hell is a Hacker?
The movie does get a few things right
Curiosity
Assumptions and Authority!
Hacker Mindset
Good at spotting flaws, inefficiencies
Must know how things work at any 
cost
Boil things to most abstract level
Are stubborn, with bloody-mindedness
Constantly testing even if inconvenient
Intuition of what is interesting to verify
Willing to take risks and fail
Доверяй, но проверяй
Trust but verify --Ronald Reagan 1987
}
Assumptions!
Why do we care about those damned 
Assumptions?
KRB4 zero-seed encrypt
everyone assumed working 
because output looked 
encrypted and worked
Buffer overruns
Assumption that you will only 
write so much data
SQL injections
Assume that variables cannot 
affect flow control
When you assume...
Assumptions Aplenty
Snake in the Peanut Brittle!
No explanation needed
Good looking websites and evil web design
Assumption of similarity to physical storefronts
Exploits assumptions of "relevant info" and "not 
relevant" through misleading graphic design 
Fighting Assumptions:
Axiomatic Design 
aka WWNSD
MIT Mechanical Engineering  & 
KAIST:  Design Methodology [Suh 2001]
Solution neutral design process
Excellent for discovering assumptions
Dr. Nam Suh says: 
"Assumptions make 
you stupid.  No good!  Y
fail!"
Axiomatic Design Process
Axiom 1: Decouple
aka. Independence Axiom
Within domain, elements MUST be independent!
Problems arise when
Customer needs assumed as functional requirements
Functional requirements assumed as design parameters
Contradictions lead to conflicts, lead to security holes
Axiom 2: Reduce complexity
aka Information Axiom
Designs with least information increase robustness
complexity opens "arbitrage" opportunities
complexity vs. user centered design
user workarounds create security holes
Beware time dependence
Some complexity is static, some is time dependent
t-dependent combinatorial complexity -> chaos
transform combinatorial into periodic
periodical, lossless "reboot"

Creating Assumption Exploits
Confusing comparisons
aka. Math is hard, let's go shopping
Jumping the Epic Level
spear phishing
generating pseudoauthority
using fantasy
Misdirection
bait and switch
Aesthetics cons
looks like a duck... must be a duck
Why do people gamble?
Odds of dying
    if you were alive 1939-1945: 1 in 221
    due to a home appliance: 1 in 1,500,000
    of terrorism in the USA: 1 in 3,500,000
    of terrorism in Canada: 1 in 3,800,000
Challenge:  Develop more approachable statistics set by 
having comparisons of things people recognize

Fantasy Hacking
Marketing people want to use fantasy/symbols to sell you stuff
Coke gives you life!
Redbull gives you wings.
Social assumptions in slogans are made evident during 
translation
Coke brings your dead ancestors back!
Ming's Market in Boston is actually "Cheap Good Grocer"
Let's look for fantasy probes and social assumptions that can 
be used to marketing-hack a particular group.
Summary
Assumptions are powerful
Lesser mind control
We need to be aware of these assumptions to avoid designing 
bad systems or exploit such systems
Axiomatic Design is a tool to identify these assumptions
Thanks for Playing!
