User: I'm trying to make a Python script run another program from its own path.
I've got the execution of the other program working using os.system, but the program will crash because it cannot find its resources (wrong path, I assume). I tried adding the folder harboring the executable to the path, but that didn't help.
Assistant: You can change the current directory of your script with os.chdir().  You can also set environment variables with os.environ
