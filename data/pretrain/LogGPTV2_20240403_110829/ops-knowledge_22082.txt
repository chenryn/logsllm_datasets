User: Is there any locking interface for Python that automatically breaks the lock when the process dies? I was under the impression that sysv ipc allows for that, but I'm still trying to figure out the details.
What I expect from the interface:

lock / release functions
working between different processes on Linux
automatic unlock when the process holding the lock dies
forced lock breaking on timeout (not necessary)
Assistant: You could apply locks to a file using fcntl.lockf or fcntl.flock. That seems to meet all your criteria. Or do you need something that doesn't require a system call every time you want to lock or unlock?
