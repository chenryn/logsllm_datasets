### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

When multiple languages are installed on a machine, users may accidentally type in the wrong language in the Run search box. For instance, if a user intends to search for "terminal" but their keyboard is set to Hebrew, they might end up typing "אקרצןמשך" (which is not a translation but rather gibberish resulting from the incorrect key mapping). 

To address this issue, we propose implementing a feature that maps the input text across different keyboard layouts and provides search suggestions based on both the original gibberish string and the intended word. This would allow the search results to include relevant matches even when the user types in the wrong language.

A similar feature is already implemented in Google Search, where searching for "אקרצןמשך" will return results for "terminal."

### Proposed Technical Implementation Details

I have been considering the implementation of this feature for some time and have explored ways to programmatically map keypress values from the keyboard into different keyboard layouts. One approach could involve creating a hard-coded map of keyboards in various layouts. However, if there is a way to achieve this automatically using low-level Windows APIs, it would significantly simplify the process.

Here’s a high-level overview of the proposed technical implementation:

1. **Keypress Mapping**:
   - Develop a mechanism to capture the keypresses and map them to different keyboard layouts.
   - Use a hard-coded map initially, and explore the possibility of using low-level Windows APIs to automate this process.

2. **Query Expansion**:
   - After mapping the input text to different language keyboard layouts, add the translated terms to the query.
   - Integrate these additional terms into the QueryBuilder, interleaving the results to provide a more comprehensive set of search suggestions.

3. **Result Interleaving**:
   - In most cases, only one term will return meaningful results, as the other terms will be gibberish.
   - Interleave the results to ensure that the most relevant and expected results are displayed prominently.

4. **User Experience**:
   - The search box will still display the original gibberish text, but the search results will "magically" include the expected results.
   - This transparent process will enhance the user experience by providing accurate and relevant search results despite the input being in the wrong language.

By implementing this feature, we aim to improve the usability of the Run search box, making it more intuitive and user-friendly for multilingual users.
