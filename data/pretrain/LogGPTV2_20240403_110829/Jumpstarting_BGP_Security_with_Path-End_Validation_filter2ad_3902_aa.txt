ABSTRACT
Extensive standardization and R&D efforts are dedicated to
establishing secure interdomain routing. These efforts fo-
cus on two mechanisms: origin authentication with RPKI,
and path validation with BGPsec. However, while RPKI is
ﬁnally gaining traction, the adoption of BGPsec seems not
even on the horizon due to inherent, possibly insurmount-
able, obstacles, including the need to replace today’s rout-
ing infrastructure and meagre beneﬁts in partial deployment.
Consequently, secure interdomain routing remains a distant
dream. We propose an easily deployable, modest extension
to RPKI, called “path-end validation”, which does not entail
replacing/upgrading today’s BGP routers. We show, through
rigorous security analyses and extensive simulations on em-
pirically derived datasets, that path-end validation yields sig-
niﬁcant beneﬁts even in very limited partial adoption. We
present an open-source, readily deployable prototype imple-
mentation of path-end validation.

INTRODUCTION
The Internet infrastructure was not designed with security
in mind, and is consequently alarmingly vulnerable. We fo-
cus on the arguably most acute problem: securing interdo-
main routing, that is, routing between the administrative do-
mains, or “Autonomous Systems” (ASes), which comprise
the Internet. As highlighted by many high-proﬁle conﬁgura-
tion errors and attacks (e.g., [1, 2, 6]), the Border Gateway
Protocol (BGP), today’s de facto interdomain routing proto-
col, is hazardously insecure [10]. However, adoption of BGP
security solutions is difﬁcult and is proceeding slowly [21].

routing, as advocated, for instance, by the IETF’s Secure
Inter-Domain Routing (SIDR) group, consists of two steps:
(1) origin authentication with the Resource Public Key In-
frastructure (RPKI) [30], followed by (2) path validation
through replacing BGP with BGPsec [11], a security-enhanced
interdomain routing protocol.
RPKI [30] certiﬁes records binding an IP-preﬁx to the
number and public key of its origin AS, i.e., the AS that
“owns” that preﬁx. RPKI certiﬁcates allow BGP routers to
perform origin authentication [36]: detect and discard pre-
ﬁx hijacks, BGP route advertisements where an IP preﬁx is
announced by an AS that is not its legitimate owner. Preﬁx
hijacks happen frequently (e.g., see [1, 2, 5, 9]), motivating
the adoption of RPKI [37].
Origin authentication (via RPKI) provides an important
ﬁrst step towards securing interdomain routing, yet it is in-
sufﬁcient to prevent path-manipulation attacks. In particu-
lar, even with RPKI fully deployed, the attacker can still
perform the next-AS attack, i.e., announce a fake link be-
tween himself and the victim AS. To address this and other
path-manipulation attacks, the IETF is standardizing BG-
Psec [11], which uses digitally-signed BGP announcements.
BGPsec prevents a BGP-speaking router from announcing a
path that is not a legitimate extension of a valid path that is
announced to it. To ensure this, BGPsec requires each AS to
sign every path advertisement that it sends to another AS, and
to validate all the signatures of previous ASes along the path.
Unlike RPKI, integration of BGPsec necessitates changes to
BGP routers [21]. Worse yet, recent work on adoption of
BGP security [33] shows that in partial deployment, BGPsec
is expected to achieve disappointingly meager security bene-
ﬁts over RPKI, while potentially even leading to less security
and other undesirable phenomena (e.g., routing instabilities).
The above serious, arguably insurmountable, obstacles fac-
ing the adoption of BGPsec, beg the question: are there alter-
native security measures that are easier to deploy than full-
ﬂedged BGPsec, share the deployability advantages of RPKI
(no need to replace routers, no online crypto, etc.), yet pro-
vide comparable security beneﬁts to BGPsec? We argue be-
low that this is indeed achievable via a modest extension to
RPKI termed path-end validation.
Path-end validation has a much more modest goal than
(full) path validation with BGPsec: it only attempts to en-
sure that the last AS hop on the advertised BGP path is valid,
i.e., that the origin AS has approved reaching it via the pre-
vious AS along the path. What level of security can a check
that merely validates that the 1-AS-hop sufﬁx of a BGP path
is valid provide? Our simulations show that even with rel-
atively few adopters, path-end validation sufﬁces to achieve
a level of security that is close to the security guarantees of
BGPsec in full deployment (before BGP is ofﬁcially depra-
cated, see [33]).
In retrospect, these surprisingly good news are easy to
comprehend. An attacker cannot fool neighboring ASes re-
garding the business relationship between him and them, and
so should intuitively advertise as short a path to the victim’s
preﬁx as it can get away with. However, the attacker is now
at a big disadvantage: he cannot pretend to own the preﬁx or
even claim to be directly connected to the victim AS with-
out being detected. Consequently, the path to the victim an-
nounced by the attacker to his neighbors must be of length
at least 2 (and this path length is increased as the announce-
ment is further propagated in the Internet). This, combined
with the fact that BGP paths are typically short (consistently
about 4-hops-long on average [35]), intuitively implies that
the vast majority of ASes will not fall victim to the attack.
Importantly, path-end validation constitutes a radical de-
parture from BGPsec’s design philosophy, which focuses on
achieving “rigorous AS path protection” [41] and does not
distinguish between paths that are partially validated and paths
that are not validated at all. Our results rely on the insight
that while partial validation of paths does not always bene-
ﬁt security, there is signiﬁcant beneﬁt in validation of path
sufﬁxes, which forces the attacker to announce longer paths.
Moreover, the shortness of interdomain routes implies that
even validating 1-hop sufﬁxes (that is, path-end validation)
provides signiﬁcant beneﬁts, as discussed above.
Our contributions:
Path-end validation (Section 2). We identify path-end val-
idation as a target security objective that is both achievable
without modifying the routing infrastructure and can signif-
icantly improve interdomain routing security even in partial
deployment.
Path-end validation is safe (Section 3). We show that path-
end validation is provably guaranteed to never destabilize the
routing system and also to never worsen security as more
ASes adopt the mechanism. While seemingly two obvious
prerequisites for the adoption of any routing security mech-
anism, these are not met by BGPsec [33]
Evaluation of security beneﬁts (Sections 4 and 5). We per-
form extensive simulations to evaluate the security impact
of adopting path-end validation, for different adoption rates.
The results are encouraging: signiﬁcant impact is obtained
even with very limited partial deployment. We also identify
the potential for regional adoption of routing security mech-
anisms, possibly government sponsored/driven. Speciﬁcally,
we analyze the impact of adoption of path-end validation in
343
geographical/national regions, and its potential to protect lo-
cal communication within these regions.
Handling other attacks (Section 6). We present and evalu-
ate feasible and easily-deployable extension of path-end val-
idation to validate more than the 1-AS-hop sufﬁx of a BGP
path. We also present a different simple extension to RPKI
can prevent certian “route leak” incidents [28, 3, 4]. We point
out that these extensions, similarly to path-end validation,
are but modest extensions to RPKI and do not involve any
changes to BGP routers.
Implementation (Section 7). We present an open-source
implementation that involves grappling with operational is-
sues such as BGP router conﬁguration complexity.
We discuss related work and conclude in Sections 8 and 9,
respectively.
2. PATH-END VALIDATION
We argue that any deployable and effective improvement
to BGP security must satisfy two constraints:
Not involve replacing today’s BGP routing infrastructure.
One of the main concerns with BGPsec and similar propos-
als is that they require replacing/upgrading BGP routers and,
consequently, the associated monetary and operational costs.
Worse yet, these proposals often require validation of (mul-
tiple) signatures when processing BGP advertisements, as
well as signing upon sending a BGP advertisement. Such
requirements make deployment very challenging [21]. We
therefore seek a security solution that, unlike BGPSec, only
entails conﬁguring today’s BGP routers (using their existing
capabilities and interfaces).
Provide signiﬁcant security beneﬁts in partial deployment.
Deployment of a new mechanism for securing interdomain
routing, which spans tens of thousands of independently ad-
ministered ASes, is expected to be a long process in which
ASes gradually adopt the new mechanism. We hence seek
solutions that provide tangible security beneﬁts in the realis-
tic partial deployment scenario, i.e., in the long interim pe-
riod of time in which the new mechanism is not ubiquitously
adopted. This should be contrasted with BGPsec, which pro-
vides meagre beneﬁts over RPKI under partial adoption [33].
We propose path-end validation as a means to achieve the
two above desiderata.
2.1 Design
Path-end records. Path-end validation extends RPKI. An
adopting AS must ﬁrst authenticate through RPKI owner-
ship of its resources: IP address blocks and AS numbers.
The AS uses its private RPKI-authorized key to sign a path-
end record which includes a list of approved adjacent ASes
through which it can be reached. These records, received
from different ASes, are stored in a database.
Path-end records can be extended to allow an AS to spec-
ify a different set of approved adjacent ASes for different IP
preﬁxes (if that AS so desires). We discuss how this can be
supported in Section 7.
Path-end ﬁltering. Path-end validation extends RPKI’s of-
ﬂine mechanism, which periodically syncs local caches at
adopting ASes to global databases, and pushes the resulting
whitelists to BGP routers [12]. Any BGP router anywhere
can thus use the path-end records registered in the system to
discard BGP path advertisements where the AS before last
does not appear in the list speciﬁed by the origin (i.e., last)
AS on the advertised path (“path-end forgery”). This ﬁlter
extends RPKI to prevent not only preﬁx-hijacking and sub-
preﬁx hijacking, but also next-AS attacks.
Example. Consider the network in Figure 1. AS 1 is the
“victim”, i.e., the AS whose trafﬁc the attacker, AS 2, at-
tempts to hijack. Suppose that AS 1, and also ASes 20, 200,
and 300, are adopters. Path-end validation protects AS 1
from falling victim to next-AS path-manipulation attacks,
where AS 2 announces the bogus route 2 − 1 to the preﬁx
1.2.0.0/16, i.e., pretends to be directly connected to AS 1.
Path-end validation does not protect against the “2-hop at-
tack”, in which AS 2 pretends to be directly connected to a
neighbor of AS 1 (say, announces the bogus route 2−40−1).
However, as shown below, such attacks turn out to be quite
ineffective as the attacker is forced to announce a 2-AS-hop
path whereas BGP paths are typically short (about 4-hops-
long on average [35]). We discuss, in Section 6, how path-
end validation can be extended to validation of longer path-
sufﬁxes.
Path-end validation vs. BGPsec. While path-end valida-
tion might seem, at ﬁrst glimpse, as a restricted variant of
BGPsec, this is not so. As discussed above, in contrast to
BGPsec, path-end validation does not rely on online cryp-
tographic signing of BGP advertisements but instead on an
ofﬂine syncing mechanism. Beyond avoiding the need for
changes to BGP routers, this has important implications from
a security perspective. Speciﬁcally, this allows validation of
BGP advertisements even when there are intermediate legacy
routers along the path. To illustrate this point, let us revisit
Figure 1. Path-end validation enables protecting all adopters,
including AS 20, from next-AS attacks against other adopters,
e.g., AS 1. Moreover, even an isolated adopter on the path,
such as AS 20, can protect the non-adopters “behind” it by
preventing malicious routes from disseminating and, in par-
ticular, a malicious advertisement will not reach AS 30. We
show in Section 4 that this valuable trait indeed leads to sig-
niﬁcant security beneﬁts even in very partial deployment,
greatly improving over the meagre beneﬁts achievable with
BGPsec [33].
