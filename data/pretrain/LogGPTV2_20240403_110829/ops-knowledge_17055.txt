Question: "Why is it important for the values R_B and R_S in a TLS handshake to be randomly generated for each connection?"
 "A": "To ensure faster handshake completion by reducing the computational overhead."
 "B": "To prevent the server from regenerating the same symmetric keys, which would allow replay attacks with old messages."
 "C": "To allow for backward compatibility with older versions of the TLS protocol."
 "D": "To enable the server to distinguish between multiple concurrent connections from the same client."
Answer: B
