I've made an electron application to execute a flash application using the
pepflashplaye plugin several platforms.
I have followed the doc https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/using-pepper-
flash-plugin
It works fine on Windows, Mac but when i execute it on linux, the electron
window is  
launched and a message appear "cannot load plug-in" . Nothing is displayed in
devTool console. (Notice the the plugin works fine with chrome browser), not
warnings, no errors ..
Is there a way to know the reason electron cannot load the plugin ?  
Can i activate some verbose logs or other messages to understand what happens
?  
Is it a known problem or bug ?
I've displayed my ppapi-flash-path before opening the window and it's the good
one ..
pluginName = '/libpepflashplayer.so';  
pluginPath = path.join(__dirname, pluginName)  
console.log ("pp = " + pluginPath)  
app.commandLine.appendSwitch('ppapi-flash-path', pluginPath)
node version is : v10.16  
electron version is : V6.0.10  
chromium : v76  
Linux CentOS 7  
lipepflashplayer.so version : Pepper Flash 32.0.0.255
