to map IP addresses. Also, some software licenses are
bound to a speciﬁc MAC address. Furthermore, even in
the presence of such techniques, user proﬁling can still
effectively track users in dense urban environments. In
our system, we use MAC addresses as temporary identi-
ﬁers for correlating information that will be used to cre-
ate user proﬁles as described below.
Live bookmarks – RSS Live bookmarking is a new
popular method for displaying web feeds as bookmarks.
Its popularity surged when it was introduced in Mozilla
Firefox 1.0 back in 2004 and can now be found in several
other popular web browsers such as Apple’s Safari and
Internet Explorer 7. Live bookmarks subscribe to user-
deﬁned RSS feeds and are periodically updated so as to
display the latest articles. The ability to customize feeds
along with the inherent periodicity of the updates make
Live Bookmarks susceptible to eavesdropper proﬁling.
In particular, as users subscribe to more RSS feeds they
inadvertently create distinct proﬁles that can be used to
track them. Given the wide range of tools available for
parsing RSS feeds, it is trivial for a tracker to parse the
feeds so as to extract user personalization in addition to
RSS subscription information. Worse, by using trafﬁc
analysis to identify such communications based on their
periodicity and creating a signature based on packet size
distributions, an attacker could possibly track users over
encrypted WLANs, however, we have not investigated
this scenario further.
Tracknet bots would collect and parse all requests to
RSS feeds. The information derived from the feed is then
associated to an individual node. The node is temporarily
identiﬁed by IP and MAC address for the current session.
Any other information that is collected from the partic-
ular node is collected in a tracking tuple that correlates
all other pertinent ﬁelds that aid in the identiﬁcation of
the node. In order to reduce the number of identiﬁcation
false positives we correlate the RSS ﬁngerprint with the
base station ESSID. Distinct ﬁngerprints that appear at
the same location (e.g. home or workplace) might point
to a distinct identify with a higher level of conﬁdence.
Location tracking Collaborating bots can use radio
signal characteristics of WLANs to determine a user’s
location with relative accuracy using triangulation tech-
niques. This information, in combination with other ex-
tracted personal information can lead to considerable pri-
vacy leaks. Speciﬁcally, bots can use this information to
infer user behavior. For example, information on enter-
tainment habits, political orientation, medical informa-
tion can be potentially derived.
Other services Beyond the mechanisms described
above, there are numerous other protocols and services
that leak signiﬁcant personal information. For example,
numerous Instant Messaging (IM) system do not employ
encryption so all user identiﬁcation information is avail-
able to eavesdroppers. Although this information might
not be signiﬁcant on its own, when it is correlated with
other sensitive information, it can be used to construct a
distinct user proﬁle. Other systems that can be used to
ﬁngerprint user behavior are the mail servers that users
connect to, information from other networking protocols
such as NETBIOS and AppleTalk and even which VPN
servers a user connects to.
The growing popularity of Google and other online
service portals, has moved a number of user services
to central aggregated locations where users can check
their RSS feeds and email. Although this conﬁgura-
tion changes the network ﬁngerprint that is emitted by
services it does not reduce the amount of information
that is leaked. For example, the Google homepage in-
cludes links to personalized RSS feeds including the
user’s email address in plain text, which often points
to a user’s real identity, e.g., john.doe@gmail.com.
This information can be readily used to create very accu-
rate user proﬁles since a tracker can intercept these un-
encrypted HTTP transfers.
Another serious vector of information leak is (to no
surprise) the use of cookies. Cookies are used exten-
sively as a mechanism for servers to identify users and
track their access. The threat of Cookies to user privacy
has received considerable attention in the literature [23].
In the context of tracknets, the exchange of Cookie in-
formation can be used to extract personalized user infor-
mation based on both the contents of the Cookies and
their transmission ﬁngerprint. For example, Google, a
company synonymous with Internet search uses cookies
that expire in 2036. The cookie uses a 16-digit identiﬁer
to track user preferences and, inevitably, track user be-
havior. Given the popularity of the search engine, it is
not unreasonable to assume that a large percentage of the
user population will emit this identiﬁer during its life-
time, adding another mechanism for user tracking.
The Dynamic Host Conﬁguration Protocol (DHCP) is
a ubiquitous protocol used for automating network con-
ﬁguration. Unfortunately, there is no privacy protection
for DHCP messages, so an eavesdropper who can mon-
itor the link between the DHCP server and requesting
client can discover the information contained in this op-
tion. For example, the following snippet illustrates the
kind of information that can be derived from a DHCP
request. Information on the types of services and more
importantly hostname information is made readily avail-
able to eavesdroppers.

We collect and correlate the information derived from
DHCP headers. In particular, we are interested in user-
identifying information such as the user’s hostname.
This information might appear innocuous but is often
linked to personal information such as the user’s name
or company information. Again, in this case we asso-
ciate DHCP-derived information with the base station’s
ESSID.
4.1 Experimental analysis
We determine how effective an attacker can be in track-
ing users using a botnet consisting of wiﬁ-enabled hosts
within a metropolitan area. For this purpose, we rely
on the same wiﬁ maps used for analyzing the worm and
spooﬁng attacks. The effectiveness of a tracknet can be
expressed in terms of coverage, that is, the fraction of
wireless LANs that are within range from a given set of
subverted nodes participating in the tracknet. The feasi-
bility of a tracknet also relates to the number of subverted
nodes that the attacker needs to obtain in order to achieve
a certain level of coverage. As the attacker may have lit-
tle control over which hosts to subvert (or buy access to)
and where they are located, in each experiment we as-
sume a random subset of hosts on the wiﬁ map. As MAC
addresses are exposed even when the network uses WEP
or 802.11i encryption, we consider all access points re-
gardless of whether they are open or protected – in other
words, a tracker can monitor any network within range.
The results for 10 metro areas are shown in Figure 6.
We observe that the fraction of subverted hosts needed
to track users is relatively modest: with hosts on just 1%
of all APs in a dense area, a tracknet can cover between
5% and 40% of all trafﬁc. As expected, full coverage is
not easy to achieve, but having trackers on around 7%
can reach between 30% and 80% coverage. As with the
worm and spooﬁng threats, the high density of Chicago
and NYC make them particularly susceptible to this at-
tack: less than 1,000 zombies are sufﬁcient to cover 40%
of the APs.
At the time of writing this paper, all MAC addresses
are exposed, but it is worth investigating whether using
disposable MAC addresses would help address this prob-
lem. As discussed previously, we are particularly con-
cerned about other high-information-leak proﬁling tech-
niques that could essentially offer uniquely identifying
information equivalent to a MAC address. We focus on
RSS feeds as one emerging source of leaks, and try to
quantify the ability of an attacker to use this information
for tracking purposes. For this purpose, we have obtained
from an online service provider the set of RSS feeds that
users are subscribed to, for around 100,000 users. The
size of the dataset is important as we seek to measure the
uniqueness of each RSS proﬁle. We therefore measure
for each user, whether any other users have the same ex-
act proﬁle, in which case we say that we have a proﬁle
collision (which could make tracking information am-
biguous and confusing to the attacker). As some users
have empty or very small proﬁles, we expect more colli-
sions there, and we therefore compute collision statistics
for those users with at least a minimum number of feeds
in their RSS set.
The results are presented in Figure 7. As expected for
a minimum RSS set of zero, that is, no constraints, the
fraction of users with colliding proﬁles is around 30% –
most of them are users with an empty proﬁle. Remov-
ing only those that have an empty proﬁle, that is, focus-
ing on a minimum set of one entry, the collision proba-
bility is 0.02 to 0.07, signiﬁcantly lower and reasonable
enough to allow a tracknet to identify a user with high
conﬁdence, especially given that this information can be
correlated with other data. For users with more substan-
tial RSS feeds, the collision probability is between 0.002
and 0.01, indicating highly unique proﬁles. The scaling
behavior of collision statistics is of particular importance
here: we see that collision probability increases with the
number of RSS proﬁles in the dataset, yet the difference
seems to be small between a database of 50K users and a
database of 100K users. If a tracknet is supposed to cover
a whole city, the number of proﬁles can be much larger
than the set we considered here, but our results suggest
that collision probability is unlikely to worsen signiﬁ-
cantly. Furthermore, when a user’s RSS ﬁngerprint is
coupled with location information such as mobility pat-
terns, this set can be reduced even further.
5 Defense strategy
The threat of wildﬁre worms and large-scale spooﬁng
can be reduced signiﬁcantly with the use of existing wire-
less security standards such as WPA/WPA2, with strong
encryption and hard-to-guess passwords. Unfortunately,
despite the wide availability of such techniques, users do
not seem to employ them. Even if this is simply because
there have been no large-scale attacks yet, the use of
passwords hinders usability and robustness. It is likely
that even if such measures are implemented, in many
cases the passwords are not going to be strong enough
to resist brute force attacks. As such, it seems worth-
while investigating alternative, reactive defenses speciﬁc
