##### System information (version)
  * OpenCV => 4.6
  * Operating System / Platform => Fedora 36
##### Detailed description
After running imshow, using cv2.waitKey(0) does not close the window even
after the user closes the pop-up window as the documentation suggests. Rather,
the pop-up window of the image closes, but the terminal running the python
file never quits. Basically, only closes pop-up, but doesn't quit the script.
(since the code is still running the waitKey(0), user cannot exit the file
using exit() either)
##### Steps to reproduce
    import cv2
    img = cv2.imread("rock.jpg")
    cv2.imshow("The Rock", img)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
