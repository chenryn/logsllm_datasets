in bursts that average 100 packets. After a period of
time an attacker sends fake signature packets which
are received at a rate of 8Mbps. For this proﬂle the
BAS implementation uses transmission groups of 1626
packets, including 20 signature packets. Each TG takes
about 2 seconds to transmit. Signature packets are
checked at the receiver with a probability of 25%. Fig-
ure 7 illustrates a few of the associated eﬁects of this
attack. Figure 7(a) shows the number of false signa-
tures checked per collection of 64 transmission groups.
Figure 7(b) shows the time required to process each
collection of 64 transmission groups. Note that this
cost rises slightly during the attack. Figure 7(c) shows
the authentication loss rate, that is, the percentage of
data packets that reached the sender but could not be

authenticated because of the loss of packets in the au-
thentication stream.
We now provide a sample of the ﬂgures we derived
from various additional experiments. Figure 8 shows
processing throughputs for independent loss rates with
no DoS attack. These experiments use the parame-
ters in Table 3. By contrast Figure 9 shows through-
puts for independent loss for a collection of diﬁerent
disproportionate attacks using the signature repetition
codes prescribed by the theory in Section 6. The ﬂrst
three pairs of experiments are for a factor 10 attack
on a 10Mbps sender at various loss rates assuming a
budget of 800 Public Key Checks (PKC) per TG. The
next three pairs are for a factor 5 attack on a 100Mbps
sender with a 400 PKC/sec budget. The last three
pairs are for a factor 5 attack on a 100Mbps sender
with a 1000 PKC/sec budget. Table 2 shows the corre-
sponding parameters for the case of 20% loss as derived
from our analysis. These ﬂgures are based on a 99%
conﬂdence for authentication.
Figure 10 shows processing throughputs for corre-
lated losses ranging from an average of 10 packets per
burst loss to 200 packets per burst loss using a two-
state Markov chain. As in Figure 8 we are assuming a
proportionate attack. Sender rates are not aﬁected by
burst rates so they remain the same as for the indepen-
dent case. Figure 11 shows authentication loss rates
plotted over burst rates. For example, if a 10Mbps
channel is used at 5% loss, then authentication losses
begin to occur at bursts of about 80.
8.3 Analysis
The scenario analyzed in Figure 7 shows that an attack
causes the receiver to check an increased number of bad
signature packets, but this number is far less than the
number actually sent since packets are checked with a
probability of 25% and signature packets for a given
TG can be ignored after a valid one is found. The time
required to prcess a TG rises during an attack, but
the added processing time is only about .02 second per
TG. This is about 1% of the processor time, which is
close to what would be predicted by Figure 7(a) and
Table 1. Figure 7(c) shows that the authentication loss
is between 2% and 3% and is not much aﬁected by the
attack.
When there is no DoS attack, receiver rates are
slightly better than sender rates. A receiver does not
need to process parity packets unless some hash packets
are lost, so the performance of a receiver is better when
there is a low loss rate. A sender needs to create more
parity packets when the channel is lossy, so higher reli-
ability leads to better performance for both the sender
and receiver. A higher rate allows more amortization
of signature costs and diﬁerent FEC characteristics, so
processing throughput rates are better for higher band-
widths. These observations address the slight decrease
in thoughputs in Figure 8 for lower bandwidths and
reliability.
When a DoS attack occurs, receiver throughputs are
signiﬂcantly degraded as a function of the factor of the
attack. Figure 9 illustrates how the choice of param-
eters can take advantage of a tradeoﬁ between band-
width overhead and throughput. For instance, the 1000
PKC/sec limit for the 100/20 proﬂle yields a lower
throughput at the receiver than the corresponding 400
PKC/sec limit but reduces the signature overhead from
8% (657 signatures per TG) to 3% (249 signatures per
TG) as shown in Table 2. The decline in throughput
is so small that it seems reasonable to use larger pro-
cessing budgets to reduce bandwidth overhead.
Our reliability parameters were based on indepen-
dent loss, but their throughput is not much aﬁected
by correlated losses, as is shown by Figure 10. When
there is a DoS attack the throughputs become lower
and more similar for diﬁerent reliability levels. Under
attack a greater percentage of processor eﬁort will be
devoted to checking false signatures so diﬁerences in
FEC costs will matter less.
As shown in Figure 11, athentication losses are
nearly absent for bursts below about 100 for all of the
proﬂles, but rise signiﬂcantly between 100 and 180. At
bursts of 200 or more authentication begins to break
down signiﬂcantly. We did not include a graph to show
this, but adding more parity packets decreases authen-
tication losses signiﬂcantly at higher burst levels.
In
particular, authentication losses are mainly due to the
loss of parity packets rather than signature packets.

Figure 11: Authentication Loss over Correlated Loss Under Proportionate DoS Signature Attack
9 Conclusion
Broadcast authentication streams provide simplicity,
e–ciency, and robust protection against denial of ser-
vice at the cost of modest additional latency and au-
thentication loss. BAS requires that the rate of the
sender is known within general bounds and upper
bounds can be placed on the loss rate and the band-
width available to an adversary. It requires only famil-
iar and well-understood FEC and cryptographic oper-
ations such as Reed-Solomon codes, SHA hashes, and
RSA signatures. BAS has bandwidth overhead and
performance as good as any previous approach to pub-
lic key authentication of broadcast streams and gives
DoS protection that is signiﬂcantly better than any pre-
vious approach. The DoS protection in BAS is based on
a new technique called selective veriﬂcation which uses
redundancy and probabilistic veriﬂcation to diminish
the adversary attack rate by large factors. We have
developed theoretical foundations for selective veriﬂca-
tion and shown its eﬁectiveness in experiments over a
broad range of communication characteristics.
