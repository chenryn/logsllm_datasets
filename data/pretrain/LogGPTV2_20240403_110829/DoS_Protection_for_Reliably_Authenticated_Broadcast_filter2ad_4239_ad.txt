### Attack Profile and Performance Analysis

**Transmission Groups (TGs) x 64:**
- **Figure 7: Scenario Attack Profile**
  - The attack involves sending bursts of packets, averaging 100 packets per burst.
  - After a certain period, an attacker sends fake signature packets at a rate of 8 Mbps.
  - For this profile, the BAS implementation uses transmission groups (TGs) consisting of 1626 packets, including 20 signature packets.
  - Each TG takes approximately 2 seconds to transmit.
  - Signature packets are checked at the receiver with a probability of 25%.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Figure 7(a):** Number of false signatures checked per collection of 64 TGs.
- **Figure 7(b):** Time required to process each collection of 64 TGs. Note that the processing time increases slightly during the attack.
- **Figure 7(c):** Authentication loss rate, which is the percentage of data packets that reached the sender but could not be authenticated due to packet loss in the authentication stream.

### Additional Experiments and Throughput Analysis

**Independent Loss Rates:**
- **Figure 8:** Processing throughputs for independent loss rates without a DoS attack, using parameters from Table 3.
- **Figure 9:** Throughputs for independent loss rates under different disproportionate attacks, using the signature repetition codes described in Section 6.
  - **Factor 10 Attack on 10 Mbps Sender:** Various loss rates with a budget of 800 PKC per TG.
  - **Factor 5 Attack on 100 Mbps Sender (400 PKC/sec Budget):** Various loss rates.
  - **Factor 5 Attack on 100 Mbps Sender (1000 PKC/sec Budget):** Various loss rates.
- **Table 2:** Parameters for 20% loss, derived from our analysis, with a 99% confidence level for authentication.

**Correlated Losses:**
- **Figure 10:** Processing throughputs for correlated losses, ranging from 10 to 200 packets per burst loss, using a two-state Markov chain.
- **Figure 11:** Authentication loss rates plotted over burst rates. For example, with a 10 Mbps channel at 5% loss, authentication losses begin at bursts of about 80 packets.

### Detailed Analysis

**Impact of Attacks:**
- **Figure 7 Analysis:**
  - An attack causes the receiver to check more bad signature packets, but the number is significantly less than the total sent due to the 25% checking probability and the ability to ignore subsequent signatures once a valid one is found.
  - The processing time per TG increases by about 0.02 seconds, which is 1% of the processor time, consistent with Figure 7(a) and Table 1.
  - The authentication loss rate remains between 2% and 3%, showing minimal impact from the attack.

**Throughput Under No Attack:**
- Receiver rates are slightly better than sender rates when there is no DoS attack.
- Receivers do not need to process parity packets unless hash packets are lost, leading to better performance at low loss rates.
- Senders must create more parity packets in lossy channels, so higher reliability improves performance for both sender and receiver.
- Higher bandwidth allows better amortization of signature costs and different FEC characteristics, resulting in better throughput rates.

**Throughput Under DoS Attack:**
- Receiver throughputs degrade significantly as a function of the attack factor.
- **Figure 9:** Trade-offs between bandwidth overhead and throughput. For example, the 1000 PKC/sec limit for the 100/20 profile yields lower throughput but reduces signature overhead from 8% to 3%.
- The decline in throughput is small, making it reasonable to use larger processing budgets to reduce bandwidth overhead.

**Correlated Losses:**
- Throughput is not significantly affected by correlated losses, as shown in Figure 10.
- Under attack, throughputs become lower and more similar across different reliability levels, with more processor effort devoted to checking false signatures.

**Authentication Losses:**
- Authentication losses are nearly absent for bursts below 100 packets but increase significantly between 100 and 180 packets.
- At bursts of 200 or more, authentication begins to break down significantly.
- Adding more parity packets can significantly decrease authentication losses at higher burst levels, with most losses due to the loss of parity packets rather than signature packets.

### Conclusion

**Broadcast Authentication Streams (BAS):**
- Provide simplicity, efficiency, and robust protection against denial of service with modest additional latency and authentication loss.
- Require the sender's rate to be known within general bounds and upper bounds on loss rate and available bandwidth for adversaries.
- Use well-understood FEC and cryptographic operations such as Reed-Solomon codes, SHA hashes, and RSA signatures.
- Offer bandwidth overhead and performance comparable to previous approaches, with significantly better DoS protection.
- Utilize selective verification, a new technique that uses redundancy and probabilistic verification to diminish adversary attack rates by large factors.
- Theoretical foundations and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BAS over a broad range of communication characteristics.
