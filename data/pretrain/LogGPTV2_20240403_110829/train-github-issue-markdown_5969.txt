# Problem description
Running the deno coverage command against the coverage report of code that
printed any unicode character will lead to a panic.
# Steps to reproduce
Create a sample file that prints any unicode character, e.g. `app.ts`:
    export function cheers() {
      console.log('🍻');
    }
    cheers();
Create a simple test that calls the given function, e.g. `app.test.ts`:
    import { cheers } from './app.ts'
    Deno.test("It should print an emoji", () => {
        cheers();
    })
Now try to create a coverage report and watch Deno panic.
# Output without backtrace
    [tmp]➡ deno run app.ts
    🍻
    [tmp]➡ deno test app.test.ts --coverage=cov
    🍻
    running 1 test from file:///tmp/app.test.ts
    test It should print an emoji ...🍻
     ok (6ms)
    test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out (64ms)
    [tmp]➡ deno coverage cov
