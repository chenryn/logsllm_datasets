Definition
Stealth Data Dispersal is an asynchronous 
covert channel

Project Goal
Reside small amounts of data on the “ether” 
(within network traffic) rather than fixed 
physical storage.

Project Benefit
Data becomes highly survivable in case of 
catastrophic failure/removal of Network Hosts

Preferred Embodiment
 Dispersal of small amounts of data ( V (w/ B’s Src Addr)
2.
V Echo Reply’s -> B, inadvertently 
echo-ing A’s data
3.
B Ack’s A directly, signaling data 
received.
4.
B repeats A’s procedure to return 
data 
Data is now bouncing between 
2 Hosts!
PS - Doubles as a good synchronous covert channel, 
as well!

1- Src = B, Dst = V

Moon-Bounce Accomplishes
1.
Possible data dispersal over 1020 hops (255 x 4) 
per co-operating Host! (as long as routes are 
chosen carefully)
2.
Double your pleasure! (double hops available 
utilizing spoofing)
3.
Delayed packet releases over mulitple routes  
ensures intermediary Hosts capable of detecting 
failure and responding!

Conclusions
1.
Stealth Data Dispersal is possible utilizing current TCP/IP 
Protocol manipulation
2.
It can be achieved very efficiently
3.
It can very stealthy and should be able to bypass most 
defenses unhindered
4.
The ICMP Moon-bounce has been rumored to be used as a 
covert channel by dark government agencies!!!
