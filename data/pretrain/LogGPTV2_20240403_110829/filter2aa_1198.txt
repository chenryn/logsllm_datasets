## Definition
Stealth Data Dispersal is an asynchronous covert channel that allows the distribution of small amounts of data within network traffic, rather than using fixed physical storage.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to store small amounts of data in the "ether" (within network traffic) instead of on fixed physical storage devices.

## Project Benefit
By dispersing data within network traffic, it becomes highly resilient and survivable in the event of catastrophic failure or removal of network hosts.

## Preferred Embodiment
### Data Bouncing Between Two Hosts
1. **Host A** sends a packet to **Host V** with **B's Source Address**.
2. **Host V** responds with an Echo Reply to **Host B**, inadvertently echoing **A's data**.
3. **Host B** acknowledges **Host A** directly, signaling that the data has been received.
4. **Host B** repeats the procedure to return the data to **Host A**.

This process creates a synchronous covert channel where data bounces between two hosts.

### Example:
- **Step 1:** Source = B, Destination = V, Data = *Key*
- **Step 2:** Source = V, Destination = B, Data = *Key*

```
A
B
1- Src = B, Dst = V
Data = *Key*
2- Src = V, Dst = B
Data = *Key*
*Key*
V
```

### Achievements
1. **Extended Reach:** Potential data dispersal over up to 1020 hops (255 x 4) per cooperating host, provided routes are carefully chosen.
2. **Enhanced Efficiency:** Doubling the number of hops through the use of IP spoofing.
3. **Robustness:** Delayed packet releases across multiple routes ensure that intermediary hosts can detect failures and respond appropriately.

## Conclusions
1. **Feasibility:** Stealth Data Dispersal is feasible using current TCP/IP protocol manipulation.
2. **Efficiency:** The method can be implemented very efficiently.
3. **Stealthiness:** It can be highly stealthy, potentially bypassing most security defenses.
4. **Rumored Use:** The ICMP Moon-bounce technique has been rumored to be used as a covert channel by certain government agencies.

### Ongoing Research
Further research is being conducted on the use of Multicast/IGMP and the development of proof-of-concept tools. For more information, visit [http://SecurityV.com/research](http://SecurityV.com/research).
