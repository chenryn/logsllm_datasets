I'm looking for implementing proper highlighting for C# code using a server
that inspects the code, and tokenizes it. The server part is already done,
however, it seems that Atom doesn't support asynchronous Grammars (or I'm just
not finding any documentation on it).
Please add an API like `highlightFile` or `highlightLines` that accept a
`Promise` (or has a callback), so that the tokenization can be asynchronous.
