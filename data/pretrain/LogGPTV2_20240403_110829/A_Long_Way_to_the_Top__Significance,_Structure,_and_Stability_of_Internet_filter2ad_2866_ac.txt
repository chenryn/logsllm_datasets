domains (cf. µBD in Table 2, reducing e.g., Umbrella to 273k base domains)

Alexa and Umbrella agree on 150k, Umbrella and Majestic on 113k,
and all three only on 99k out of 1M domains.
For the Top1k lists, the picture is more pronounced. On average
during the JOINT period, Alexa and Majestic agree on 295 domains,
Alexa and Umbrella on 56, Majestic and Umbrella on 65, and all
three only on 47 domains.
This disparity between top domains suggests a high bias in the
list creation. We note that even both web-based lists, Alexa and
Majestic, only share an average of 29% of domains.
Standing out from Figure 1a is the fact that the Alexa list has
changed its nature in January 2018, reducing the average intersec-
tion with Majestic from 285k to 240k. This change also introduced
a weekly pattern, which we discuss further in §6.2. We speculate
that Alexa might have reduced its 3-month sliding window [8],
making the list more volatile and susceptible to weekly patterns.
We contacted Alexa about this change, but received no response.
5.3 Studying Top List Discrepancies
The low intersection between Umbrella and the other lists could be
rooted in the DNS vs. web-based creation. Our hypothesis is that
the web-based creation of Alexa and Majestic lists tends to miss
domains providing embedded content as well as domains popular
on mobile applications [67, 100]. In this section, we explore the
origin of discrepancies across domain lists.
We aggregate the Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic Top 1k domains
from the last week of April 2018, and analyse the set of 3,005 disjunct
domains across these lists, i.e., those found only in a single list. 40.7%
of these domains originate from Alexa, 37.1% from Umbrella, and
22.1% from Majestic. Subsequently, we identify whether the disjunct
domains are associated with mobile traffic or third-party advertis-
ing and tracking services not actively visited by users, but included
through their DNS lookups. We opt against utilizing domain classi-
fiers such as the OpenDNS Domain Tagging service [101], as it has
been reported that categories are vague and coverage is low [100].
Instead, we use the data captured by the Lumen Privacy Mon-
itor [102] to associate domains with mobile traffic for more than
60,000 Android apps, and use popular anti-tracking blacklists such

as MalwareBytes’ hpHosts ATS file [103]. We also check if the do-
mains from a given top list can be found in the aggregated Top 1M
of the other two top lists during the same period of time. Table 3
summarises the results. As we suspected, Umbrella has significantly
more domains flagged as “mobile traffic” and third-party advertis-
ing and tracking services than the other lists. It also has the lowest
proportion of domains shared with other Top 1M lists.
This confirms that Umbrella is capable of capturing domains
from any device using OpenDNS, such as mobile and IoT devices,
and also include domains users are not aware of visiting, such
as embedded third-party trackers in websites. Alexa and Majestic
provide a web-specific picture of popular Internet domains.
6 STABILITY OF TOP LISTS
Armed with a good understanding of the structure of top lists, we
now focus on their stability over time. Research has revealed hourly,
daily and weekly patterns on ISP traffic and service load, as well as
significant regional and demographic differences in accessed con-
tent due to user habits [104–107]. We assess whether such patterns
also manifest in top lists, as a first step towards understanding the
impact of studies selecting a top list at a given time.
6.1 Daily Changes
We start our analysis by understanding the composition and evolu-
tion of top lists on a daily basis. As all top lists have the same size,
we use the raw count of daily changing domains for comparison.
Figure 1b shows the count of domains that were removed daily,
specifically the count of domains present in a list on day n but
not on day n+1. The Majestic list is very stable (6k daily change),
the Umbrella list offers significant churn (118k), and the Alexa list

used to be stable (21k), but drastically changed its characteristic in
January 2018 (483k), becoming the most unstable list.
This behaviour is further confirmed in Figure 2b. In this figure,
we compute the intersection between a fixed starting day and the
upcoming days. We compute it seven times, with each day of the
first week of the JOINT dataset as the starting day. Figure 2b shows
the daily median value between these seven intersections.
This shows several interesting aspects: (i) the long-term trend
in temporal decay per list, confirming much of what we have seen
before (high stability for Majestic, weekly patterns and high insta-
bility for Umbrella and the late Alexa list) (ii) the fact that for Alexa
and Umbrella, the decay is non-monotonic, i.e., a set of domains is
leaving and rejoining at weekly intervals.
For How Long are Domains Part of a Top List? We inves-
tigate the average number of days a domain remains in both the
Top 1M and Top 1k lists in Figure 2c. This figure displays a CDF
with the number of days from the JOINT dataset in the x-axis, and
the normalised cumulative probability that a domain is included
on the list for X or fewer days. Our analysis reveals significant
differences across lists. While about 90% of domains in the Alexa
Top 1M list are in the list for 50 or fewer days, 40% of domains
in the Majestic Top 1M list remain in the list across the full year.
With this reading, lines closer to the lower right corner are “better”
in the sense that more domains have stayed in the list for longer
periods, while lines closer to the upper left indicate that domains
get removed more rapidly. The lists show quite different behaviour,
with Majestic Top 1k being the most stable by far (only ≈ 26% of
domains present on < 100% of days), and being followed by Majes-
tic Top 1M, Umbrella Top 1k, Alexa Top 1k, Umbrella Top 1M, and
Alexa Top 1M. The Majestic Top 1M list offers stability similar to
the Alexa and Umbrella Top 1k lists.
6.2 Weekly Patterns
We now investigate the weekly7 pattern in the Alexa and Umbrella
lists as observed in Figure 1b. We generally do not include Majestic
as it does not display a weekly pattern. In this section, we resort to
various statistical methods to investigate those weekend patterns.
We will describe each one of them in their relevant subsection.
How Do Domain Ranks Change over the Weekends? The
weekly periodical patterns shown in Figure 1b show that list con-
tent depends on the day of the week. To investigate this pattern
statistically, we calculate a weekday and weekend distribution of
the rank position of a given domain and compute the distance be-
tween those two distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
7It is unclear what cut-off times list providers use, and how they offset time zones. For
our analysis, we map files to days using our download timestamp
The fluctuations in the Umbrella list, and in the Alexa list after
January 2018, are weekly patterns, which we investigate closer in
§6.2. The average daily changes are given in column µ∆ of Table 2.
Which Ranks Change? Previous studies of Internet traffic
revealed that the distribution of accessed domains and services fol-
lows a power-law distribution [68, 104–107]. Therefore, the ranking
of domains in the long tail should be based on significantly smaller
and hence less reliable numbers.
Figure 1c displays the stability of lists depending on subset size.
The y-axis shows the mean number of daily changing domains in
the top X domains, where X is depicted on the x-axis. For example,
an x-value of 1000 means that the lines at this point show the aver-
age daily change per list for the Top 1k domains. The figure shows
instability increasing with higher ranks for Alexa and Umbrella,
but not for Majestic. We plot Alexa before and after its January
2018 change, highlighting the significance of the change across all
its ranks–even its Top 1k domains have increased their instability
from 0.62% to 7.7% of daily change.
New or In-and-out Domains? Daily changes in top lists may
stem from new domains joining, or from previously contained
domains re-joining. To evaluate this, we cumulatively sum all the
unique domains ever seen in a list in Figure 2a, i.e., a list with
only permutations of the same set of domains would be a flat line.
Majestic exhibits linear growth: every day, about 2k previously not
included domains are added to it — approximately a third of the
6k total changing domains per day (i.e., 4k domains have rejoined).
Over the course of a year, the total count of domains included in
the Majestic list is 1.7M. Umbrella adds about 20k new domains
per day (out of 118k daily changing domains), resulting in 7.3M
domains after one year. Alexa grows by 5k (of 21k) and 121k (of
483k) domains per day, before and after its structural change in
January 2018. Mainly driven from the strong growth after Alexa’s
change, its cumulative number of domains after one year is 13.5M.
