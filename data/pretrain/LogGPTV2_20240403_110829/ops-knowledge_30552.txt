User: I have been looking around for UART baud rates supported by the Beaglebone Black (BB). I can't find it in the BB system reference manual or the datasheet for the sitara processor itself. I am using pyserial and the Adafruit BBIO library to communicate over UART.
Does this support any value within reason or is it more standard (9600, 115200, etc.)?
Thanks for any help.
-UPDATE-
It is related to the baud rates supported by PySerial. This gives a list of potential baud rates, but not specific ones that will or will not work with specific hardware.
Assistant: The BBB reference manual does not contain any information on Baud Rate for UART but for serial communication I usually prefer using value of BAUDRATE = 115200, which works in most of the cases without any issues.
