I was experiencing a bizarre issue where the TS language service broke down
and wouldn't underline errors in my code. After pulling my hair out for half
an hour, I figured out it was because I was doing a file import with the wrong
case e.g.
import Engine from "./Engine"
instead of
import Engine from "./engine"
The default class exported was named 'Engine' which I think might have also
had something to do with it.
Open the attached folder in VS Code, then pick the "engine.ts" file and notice
that there is an undefined symbol ("jjj_this_is_an_error") that is not red
underlined.
I would expect a better error on the erroneous import instead of the imported
file no longer having proper language services. :)
