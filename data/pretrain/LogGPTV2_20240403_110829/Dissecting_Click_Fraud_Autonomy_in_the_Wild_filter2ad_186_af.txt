### Figure 12: Number of Fraudulent Apps Grouped by Different Categories on Google Play and Huawei AppGallery

### Appendix A: Results of Fraudulent Apps and SDKs

Table 5 lists some of the apps with a large number of downloads that implement humanoid attacks. The full list will be submitted to Huawei and Google. The download numbers are from either Google Play or Huawei AppGallery. The highest number of downloads (from Huawei AppGallery) reached 3.7 billion. ClickScanner successfully locates where these click frauds occur in the code, which facilitates digital forensics of these fraudulent behaviors. Additionally, we indicate whether these humanoid attacks were caused by advertising SDKs in the sixth column.

### Appendix B: Distribution of Apps Affected by Humanoid Attacks

To quantify the damage of humanoid attacks in the real world, it is important to understand the category distribution of identified malicious apps. For each fraudulent app, we extract its category (e.g., books, education, weather) as labeled by the app markets and illustrate the statistical results in Figure 12. There is a significant difference between the categories of fraudulent apps from Google Play and Huawei AppGallery. For instance, among 25 categories, fraudulent apps from both app markets exist in only 8 categories. Since the target users in Google Play and Huawei AppGallery are different (i.e., the former mainly targets U.S. and Europe, while the latter mainly targets China), the marketing differences may be due to interest/cultural differences of users and their interests in mobile ads [21]. For example, fraudulent apps detected in Huawei AppGallery are concentrated in "Education," "Books," and "Shopping" due to China's prosperous online shopping industry and cultural emphasis on education, while in Google Play, the detected apps are concentrated in "News" and "Magazines" due to the diversity of media in society. It is also worth noting that there are apps from the "Tools" category marked by ClickScanner in both markets. This may be because it is easier to obtain system permissions to hide fraudulent activities for these types of apps. In summary, these discoveries indicate that application markets in different regions need to focus on vetting different types of applications.

### Appendix C: Distribution of Fraudulent SDKs

We also analyze the distribution of fraudulent SDKs across all 157 apps according to their categories. As shown in Figure 13, the fraudulent apps existing in nearly half of the categories (19/45) are affected by 11 SDKs in total. This shows that the use of SDKs to commit humanoid attacks is not an isolated case against a certain category of apps but a common method deserving attention. Furthermore, it is observed that the `com.mo***` SDK and `com.iB***` SDK have infected a large proportion of applications. Therefore, to effectively thwart humanoid attacks, it is vital to put efforts into vetting SDKs as well as the apps.
