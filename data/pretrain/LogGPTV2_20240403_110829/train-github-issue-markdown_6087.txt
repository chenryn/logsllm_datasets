I just did a pull from the HEAD and using mesos 0.25. To reproduce, I use a
very simple guestbook yaml:
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: guestbook
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis
      - name: guestbook
        image: google/guestbook-python-redis
        ports:
        - name: www
          containerPort: 80
Creating the pod with `kubect create -f guestbook.yaml`. After the pod is
showing as RUNNING, run `kubectl logs -c redis guestbook` will result in the
following error message:
    Error from server: the server could not find the requested resource ( Pod guestbook)
This only seems to impact k8sm setup, and k8s-standalone works as expected.
