especially in its later years, was engaging in dubious research, or even perpetuating a 
cover up of UFO evidence. Evidence suggests that not only did some UFO reports bypass 
Blue Book entirely, but that the U.S. Air Force continued collecting and studying UFO 
reports after Blue Book had been discontinued, despite official claims to the contrary. 
leading to ...  
The Condon Committee 
The Condon Committee was the informal name of the University of 
Colorado UFO Project, a study of UFOs, undertaken at the U of Colorado 
and directed by physicist Edward Condon from 1966 to 1968. The Condon 
Committee was instigated at the behest of the USAF which had studied 
UFOs since the 1940's. 
After examining many hundreds of UFO files from the Air Force’s Project 
Blue Book and from civilian UFO groups, the Committee selected 56 to 
analyze in detail for its final report; a document which, wrote Hynek, was 
intended "presumably to settle once and for all ... the vexing problem of 
UFOs with which the air force had been saddled for 20 years." (Hynek, 192) 
This final report (Formally titled Scientific Study of Unidentified Flying 
Objects but commonly called the Condon Report) was published in 1968. 
It officially concluded that no UFO reports were anomalous, all UFO reports 
had conventional explanations, and further study of the subject would not be 
worthwhile. The Report’s conclusions were generally welcomed by the 
scientific community, and have been cited as a decisive factor in the 
generally low levels of interest regarding UFOs among academics in 
subsequent years. Peter Sturrock writes that the report is "the most 
influential public document concerning the scientific status of this (UFO) 
problem. Hence, all current scientific work on the UFO problem must make 
reference to the Condon Report."  
However, critics--then and now, including some of the Committee’s 
members--have charged that the Committee’s final report was biased, 
unscientific and shaped by the Air Force’s expectations. Furthermore, critics 
have noted that Condon's summaries of UFO case studies are often sharply 
at odds with the reports they attempt to describe.  
Astrophysicist Peter Sturrock writes that "The great weight attached to this 
report by scientists, by the public and perhaps by officers of the federal 
government, is based on the presumption that the study was, in fact, 
scientific. This has been disputed by a number of individuals," perhaps most 
notably physicist James E. McDonald and astronomer Hynek. (Sturrock, 37) 
Sturrock himself offered a detailed critique of the Committee, noting what 
he argues are often glaring errors and contradictions. 
Among the most obvious discrepancies frequently noted by critics is the fact 
that while the Condon Report declared that all UFO reports had prosaic 
explanations, they simultaneously classified 30 percent of their 56 case 
studies as "unknown"; this was a higher percentage of unknowns than any 
previous Air Force UFO study. A few of the cases were judged most 
puzzling, even after detailed analysis, but Condon made no mention of these 
instances. 
Beyond the Report’s disputed conclusions, the Committee was plagued with 
infighting and controversy nearly from its inception. Of sixteen original 
Committee members, two were fired, one resigned in protest, and another 
stepped down after facing legal troubles unrelated to the Committee. Citing 
work by Dr. Swords, Sturrock notes "of the fifteen top staff members, at 
least twelve ... definitely disagreed with (Condon)" and his methods, ideas 
and conclusions. (Sturrock, 46) This infighting led to a high turnover rate 
amongst the staff. 
On August 9, 1966, Low wrote a memorandum intended to persuade the 
more reluctant faculty to accept the UFO project. This so-called "Trick 
Memo" explained how the University could perform the project without 
risking their reputation, and how the University UFO research project could 
arrive at a predetermined conclusion while appearing objective. In part, Low 
wrote: 
"Our study would be conducted almost entirely by non-believers who, 
though they couldn't possibly prove a negative result, could and probably 
would add an impressive body of thick evidence that there is no reality to the 
observations. The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that, to 
the public, it would appear a totally objective study but, to the scientific 
community, would present the image of a group of non-believers trying their 
best to be objective but having an almost zero expectation of finding a 
saucer." Low also suggested that if the study focused less on "the physical 
reality of the saucer", and more on the "psychology and sociology of person 
and groups who report seeing UFOs", then "the scientific community would 
get the message". (Clark, 594)

One reason for managing this event: “cultural intrusion” 
On December 14, 1960, The Brookings Research Institute in 
Washington released a report prepared during 1960 for NASA entitled 
"Proposed Studies on the Implications of Peaceful Space Activities for 
Human Affairs", including a section entitled "Implications of a 
Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life". (Commonly referred to as "the 
Brookings Institute report".) The report discusses effects of meeting 
extraterrestrial life: "It is possible that if the intelligence of these 
creatures were sufficiently superior to ours, they would choose to have 
little if any contact with us. . . "  
SPACE-LIFE REPORT COULD BE SHOCK, UFOI, Vol. I, 
No. II (Dec 1960 - Jan 1961 issue) 
The discovery of intelligent space beings could have a severe 
effect on the public, according to a research report released by the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The report 
warned that America should prepare to meet the psychological 
impact of such a revelation. 
The 190-page report was the result of a $96,000 one-year study 
conducted by the Brookings Institution for NASA's long-range 
study committee. 
Public realization that intelligent beings live on other planets 
could bring about profound changes, or even the collapse of our 
civilization, the research report stated. 
"Societies sure of their own place have disintegrated when 
confronted by a superior society," said the NASA report. 
"Others have survived even though changed. Clearly, the 
better we can come to understand the factors involved in 
responding to such crises the better prepared we may be." 
Even though the UFO problem was not indicated as a reason for 
the study, it undoubtedly was an important factor. Fear of public 
reaction to an admission of UFO reality was cited as the main 
reason for secrecy in the early years of the AF investigation. 
(Confirmed to NICAP's present director in 1952-3, when the AF 
was planning to release important UFO reports, also the famous 
Utah motion-pictures of a UFO formation.) 
This report gives weight to previous thinking by scholars who 
have suggested that the earth already may be under close scrutiny 
by advanced space races. In 1958, Prof. Harold D. Lasswell of the 
Yale Law School stated: 
"The implications of the UFOs may be that we are 
already viewed with suspicion by more advanced 
civilizations and that our attempts to gain a foothold 
elsewhere may be rebuffed as a threat to other systems of 
public order." (UFO Investigator, Dec. 1958.)

COMETA - 1999 - speaking for Europeans – “It is clear that the Pentagon 
has had, and probably still has, the greatest interest in concealing, as best it 
can, all of this research, which may, over time, lead the United States to hold 
a position of great supremacy over terrestrial adversaries, while giving it a 
considerable response capability against a possible threat coming form 
space.” 
[On Friday July 16, 1999 an important document was published in France 
entitled, UFOs and Defense: What must we be prepared for? ("Les Ovni Et La Defense: 
A quoi doit-on se préparer?"). This ninety-page report is the result of an in-depth study of  
UFOs, covering many aspects of the subject, especially questions of national defense. 
The study was carried out over several years by an independent group of former 
"auditors" at the Institute of Advanced Studies for National Defense, or IHEDN, and by 
qualified experts from various fields. Before its public release, it has been sent to        
French President Jacques Chirac and to Prime Minister Lionel ospin. 
           In its final recommendations, COMETA stresses again the need to: 
             1.Inform all decision-makers and persons in positions of responsibility.  
             2.Reinforce means of investigation and study at SEPRA.  
             3.Consider whether UFO detection been taken into account by agencies engaged 
                in surveillance of space.  
             4.Create a strategic committee at the highest state level.  
             5.Undertake diplomatic action with the Unites States for cooperation on this most 
                important question.  
             6.Study measures which might be necessary in case of emergencies.  
           Finally, this document is accompanied by seven interesting appendices which are 
           worth reading even by seasoned ufologists: 
             1.Radar detection in France  
             2.Observations by astronomers  
             3.Life in the Universe  
             4.Colonization of space  
             5.The Roswell case and possible disinformation  
             6.Antiquity of the UFO phenomenon and elements for a chronology.  
             7.Reflection on various psychological, sociological and political aspects of the 
                UFO phenomenon.] 
Incident at Exeter – first-hand report from a NSA analyst whose son-in-law 
was at the base and told him the USAF issued a cover story and that “we 
did not have any idea what they were.” There was no B52 exercise that 
night, as claimed, and Hynek was told by officers at the base when he 
investigated: “We just don’t know.”  
If the research IS being done  ... how would we know? 
a conversation with an intelligence professional about recruitment ... 
symptoms of crossing the threshold. 
Some concluding thoughts – what might “they” be doing? Why are 
governments like ours still reluctant to reveal what they know when the 
governments of Brazil, France, Belgium, and others have opened files and 
called for global collaboration in responding to the phenomena?  What are 
the genuine security concerns and implications? Why is it inappropriate to 
speak of the “government” as the agency that is acting in this instance?
