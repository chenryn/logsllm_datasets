I apologize if this is the wrong place to report this, but I don't know where
else to do this.
Clicking on the link labeled "var" on this page:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.statistics.html  
takes you to the page:
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.var.html#numpy.var  
However, that page says "Internal Server Error". Clearly the link is broken
and needs to be fixed.
