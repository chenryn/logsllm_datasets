I'm new with Vuejs and probably my issue is a dummy one, but I've not still
realized how to fix it.
**Situation** : I have a collection of objects which I've sorted with lodash:
    {
      computed: {
        sortedAlerts: function() {
          return _.orderBy(this.filteredAlerts, 'createdAtUtc', 'desc');
        }
      }
    }
And iterating with `v-for="alert in sortedAlerts"`.
I also display one of the object property with the usage of Vuejs component:
    components: {
        'alert-title': {
            props: ['model'],
            computed: {
                indicatorTitle: function() {
                    return this.alert.indicator.title.toLowerCase();
                },
                conditionTitle: function() {
                    return this.alert.condition.title.toLowerCase();
                }
            },
            template:'{{indicatorTitle}} is {{conditionTitle}} {{alert.amount}}',
            data: function() {
                return {
                    alert: this.model
                }
            }
        }
    }
like this ``.
Finally, when I add new objects into this array (which going to be the first
elements in ordered array), the `alert-title` component do not display newly
added object in a proper way (but continue to display the **previous one** ,
which now is actualty the second and duplicate).
Page refresh is fixing this situation, but I'm pretty sure that the code have
an issue.
I know it's not too clear but I hope someone could figure out what's wrong
with it.
Let me know if an example should also be provided.
Thank you.
