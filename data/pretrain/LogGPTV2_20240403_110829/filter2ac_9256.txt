### Title: Black Hat US-18: Demystifying PTSD in the Cybersecurity Environment

In February 2018, an article on "cybersecurity PTSD" and its impact on the security workforce sparked a significant reaction. The term and the conditions it referenced resonated with many in the industry, who have often heard colleagues describe stressful experiences as a form of workplace "PTSD." While it can be therapeutic to joke about serious issues, as someone who has experienced and survived Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), I recognize the importance of addressing this topic with both sensitivity and candor.

The number of diagnosed cases of PTSD is on the rise, whether from sexual trauma, military service, or other traumatic events. This increase means that the likelihood of encountering someone with PTSD in the workplace is also growing. As the cybersecurity industry continues to expand and mature, it is crucial that we do not ignore, avoid, or stigmatize this issue. Instead, we should embrace the opportunity to better understand and support those living with PTSD, creating a more inclusive and understanding work environment.

In this talk, I will share my personal journey with PTSD, from my military service in Afghanistan to a unique medical trauma. These experiences have profoundly shaped both my life and my career in cybersecurity. For me, the field of cybersecurity has provided a cognitive and emotional haven, and I believe I am not alone in finding solace in our profession. By sharing my story, I aim to highlight key points that our community can adopt to better understand and support individuals with PTSD.

The goal is to keep the discussion approachable while delving into how the security culture both supports and challenges PTSD survivors. Ultimately, fostering a more empathetic and emotionally aware cybersecurity community will benefit us all, and addressing PTSD is an excellent starting point for this conversation.
