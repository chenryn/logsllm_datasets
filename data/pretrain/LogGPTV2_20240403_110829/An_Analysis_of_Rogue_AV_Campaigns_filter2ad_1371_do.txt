Figure 8 shows the distributions of the six features for benign servers, tra-
ditional bots, and fast-ﬂux bots. Clearly, fast-ﬂux bots lead to much higher
magnitudes for all six features compared with the other two server categories,

Fig. 8. The cumulative distribution functions of network delays, processing delays,
and document fetch delays, and their respective standard deviations of three server
categories were measured based on 5 probes
manifesting the eﬀects of the intrinsic characteristics of fast-ﬂux bots. The mag-
nitudes of the six features of traditional bots are generally lower than those of
fast-ﬂux bots, but higher than those of benign servers except for the standard
deviation of network delays. We believe this is because benign servers usually
have more visitors than the other two categories of servers; therefore, network
links to benign servers tend to be busy and it is more likely that a slightly higher
degree of network queuing and delay variations will be observed.
5.3 Detection Performance
The graphs in Figure 8 conﬁrm that the six features we derived may vary signiﬁ-
cantly according to the type of web server a user browses. In this sub-section, we
perform supervised classiﬁcation using SVM based on the derived six features.
Although we focus on the detection of fast-ﬂux bots, we also include tradi-
tional bots in our evaluation. This is because, according to our analysis
(Section 3), traditional bots also behave diﬀerently to benign servers in terms
of most of the deﬁned delay metrics. We perform two types of binary classiﬁca-
tion using SVM, namely, benign servers vs. fast-ﬂux bots and benign servers vs.
traditional bots. Figure 9(a) shows the relationship between the classiﬁcation
accuracy and the number of samples observed (which may vary according to the
number of accessory ﬁles of webpages), where the accuracy is derived using 10-
fold cross validation. The results show that our scheme achieves more than 95%
accuracy when we try to distinguish fast-ﬂux bots from benign servers, even when
only one sample (i.e., the TCP connection) is observed. We ﬁnd that it is more
