User: How to configure remote SSH access in Linux system?
Assistant: Configuring remote SSH access in the Linux system requires the following steps: 1. Confirm that SSH has been installed: use the command `ssh â€“-version` to check the version number. If it prompts that it is not installed, you need to install SSH first. 2. Configure the SSH service: modify the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config, and add a line of AllowUsers username at the end of the file, where username is the username that needs to access the Linux system. 3. Start the SSH service: Use the command `sudo service ssh start` to start the SSH service. 4. Firewall settings: If the Linux system has a firewall enabled, you need to open the SSH port (port 22 by default), and use the command `sudo ufw allow ssh` to open the SSH port. 5. Verify remote access: Use the SSH client tool on other computers to enter the IP address and user name of the Linux system for remote SSH access. For example, use the command `ssh username@ip_address` to connect. 6. Troubleshooting: If the remote access fails, you can check the SSH configuration file, firewall configuration, network connection and other problems for troubleshooting.
