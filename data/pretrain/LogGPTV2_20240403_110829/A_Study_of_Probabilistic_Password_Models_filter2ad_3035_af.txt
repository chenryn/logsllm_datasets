#### Related Work

**Password Quality and Entropy Estimation**

One active area of research in recent years has been the study of users' password choices under various scenarios. These include different password policies [18], [17], the use of password strength meters [23], [10], forced password changes due to policy updates [22], and the inclusion of additional randomness in passwords [12]. For example, Mazurek et al. [20] collected over 25,000 real passwords from CMU and analyzed them across different user groups.

Earlier studies used standard password cracking tools like John the Ripper (JTR) [3] and ad hoc methods to estimate password entropy. NIST's recommended scheme for estimating entropy primarily relies on password length [7]. Researchers such as Florencio and Herley [11], Forget et al. [12], and Egelman et al. [10] have used the formula \( \log_2((\alpha \cdot \text{size})^{\text{len}}) \), which can overestimate password strength. Weir et al. [25] developed the PCFGW model, arguing that traditional entropy estimation methods are inaccurate. They proposed using guess numbers, which has become a standard method in recent password security research [17], [18], [15], [23], [20].

**Cracking Tools and Models**

John the Ripper [3] is a popular password cracking tool with several modes, including wordlist, incremental, and Markov chain-based approaches. Narayanan and Shmatikov [21] introduced a template-based model using Markov chains, but experimental results show that higher-order or variable-order Markov models perform better.

Castelluccia et al. [8] proposed whole-string Markov models for evaluating password strengths. Our work extends this by comparing the performance of various models in a design space. Dellâ€™Amico et al. [9] compared the effectiveness of Markov models on different datasets but did not consider normalization and smoothing, leading to underestimated search spaces.

Malone and Maher [19] investigated how well password distributions fit Zipf distributions, fitting the RockYou dataset to a Zipf distribution with \( b = 0.7878 \). Bonneau [5] also explored the relationship between password distributions and Zipf distributions.

**Critiques and Metrics**

Bonneau [6] criticized the comparability and repeatability of past password cracking results, proposing metrics based on distribution rather than actual password strings. This work is largely orthogonal to ours, as our approach uses standard Markov models to address some of the limitations identified in [6].

### Conclusions

This paper makes three key contributions:
1. Introducing probability-threshold graphs for evaluating password datasets.
2. Integrating statistical language modeling techniques into password modeling, identifying new issues like normalization, and exploring a broad design space for password models.
3. Conducting a systematic study of various password models, showing that the PCFGW model, often considered state-of-the-art, underperforms whole-string Markov models in our experiments.

We expect that the new methodology and knowledge of Markov model effectiveness will benefit future password research.
