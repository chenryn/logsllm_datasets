### Too Difficult
- **Not Considered**: The organizers did not take this dimension into account when designing the exercise.

### Appendix C: Additional Dimensions
In Table II, we present the results of our pedagogical review, which revealed limited variability among the exercises. These dimensions were not included in Table I due to space constraints.

### Appendix A: Interview Protocol
Over the past few months, we have been examining several online capture-the-flag competitions, wargames, and other security exercises with an educational focus. For each exercise, we completed several challenges, reviewing the content and the way it was presented to students. Our goal was to assess how each exercise is organized, focusing on features commonly recommended in the learning science and education literature. These include connecting to the learner's prior knowledge, organizing knowledge, providing active practice and feedback, encouraging metacognitive learning, and establishing a supportive environment.

In this interview, we will discuss each of these categories, the specific dimensions, and how they are applied in your exercise. We have a few goals for this interview:
1. To ensure we have a clear understanding of your exercise. You know it better than we do, so we want to tap into your knowledge to ensure we are not missing anything.
2. To understand more about why your exercise is organized the way it is. The dimensions we are looking at are recommendations, not requirements. We expect an exercise to incorporate some, but not all, of these dimensions. Therefore, we want to explore the reasons behind your decisions to include or exclude certain elements.

#### A. General Organizational Questions
Before we begin our review, I have a few general questions about your organization to help us better understand the context in which the exercise was developed.

1. **Motivation**: What led you to create your exercise? What was your main motivation in providing this educational platform?
2. **Target Audience**: Who is your target audience?

### Table II: Additional Dimensions of Pedagogical Analysis
Each column in Table II indicates whether an exercise fully ((cid:32)), partially ((cid:71)(cid:35)), or not at all ((cid:35)) implemented the pedagogical dimension. The final column provides the number of challenges reviewed for each exercise.
