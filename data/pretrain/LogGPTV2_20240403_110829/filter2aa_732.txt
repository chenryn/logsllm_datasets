10 Things That Are Pissing Me Off
● There's a lot more, but we're sticking to Hacker 
related ones
● This is cheaper than therapy
● Got so pissed off I'm doing something about 
some of them, others I need help
● Save discussion till afterwards, I only have 20 
minutes
#1 WPA-RADIUS Documentation
#1 WPA-RADIUS Documentation
● Been saying 'use WPA-RADIUS' for best 
security for years
● Ever tried to set it up open source?
● No two sets of documentation is the same
● Every distro a little different
● Took me weeks to get something running
● How is Joe IT guy supposed to do it if I can't?
#1 WPA-RADIUS Documentation
● Decided to write generic laymans instructions 
● Distro, vendor generic instructions for building a 
small WPA-RADIUS system
● Maybe a Wiki for others to submit their own 
changes and notes about different systems, 
scripts, ideas, etc.
● Every AP supports it, why is'nt it being used; 
Because it's confusing as hell.
#2 Ideas Dying a Horrible Death
#2 Ideas Dying a Horrible Death
● Like many, I have random ideas
● Some better than others
● Some need to be made into products for the 
greater good
● i.e. Wedding photo download station
#2 Ideas Dying a Horrible Death
● Got married in the spring, wanted as many 
photo's as possible.  Most guests had digital 
cameras
● In a moment of brilliance, setup laptop w/ 25-in-
one card reader, got everyones pics as they 
left, an extra 1000 photo's
● Some simple refinements could make a good 
product to sell to wedding planners and 
photographers. Put me down for 10% gross
● Need to talk more and not hoard ideas
#3 Lack of Tool Evolution
#3 Lack Of Tool Evolution
● So many useful wireless (and other) tools never 
develop beyond proof-of-concept
● Airpwn, Karma, Void11
● I can't code so I can't fix it
● I can bribe though!
#3 Lack of Tool Evolution
● Wireless Village project
● Posted development I think needs to be tackled 
and reward milestones, feel free to exceed 
goals
● Beer, 10 years worth of stickers, maybe cash, 
whatever I can scrape up
● All open source tools with evolution to be freely 
available
● 8000 hackers together in the same place, why 
not see what happens when you ask for a tool
#4 802.11n
#4 802.11n
● 40Mhz channels scare me
● Already have issues with interference on 
802.11b/g (channel 1,6,11 all very busy)
● Now a neighboor can setup a 802.11n station 
and stomp all over everyone (Greenfield mode)
● Any ideas what to do about this problem, other 
than make money consulting and prolonging 
the problem?
● Discussed in the wireless village, but want to 
hear from more people
#4 802.11n
#5 Protocol Discrimination
#5 Protocol Discrimination
● Santa Fe, New Mexico
● Group 'Allergic' to Wi-Fi alleges that Wi-Fi in 
public buildings is discrimination and violating 
their rights under ADA
● I'm allergic to stupid, your existence is violation 
of my rights
● How can you be allergic to a protocol, what 
about Bluetooth on patrons?  Cordless phones? 
 All the other 2.4Ghz devices?
● Has anyone put him in a faraday cage to test?
#5 Protocol Discrimination
● By their own logic, they should probobly be 
dead
● Too many sources to regulate
● I'm allergic to Police band radios, please stop 
using them
● Easy solution, money out of my own pocket to 
do it....
#5 Protocol Discrimination
#6 Airline Rate Fluctuations
#6 Airline Rate Fluctuations
● Why is it that Airplane ticket costs rise and fall 
over time?
● Edmonton to New York via Toronto is cheaper 
than Edmonton to Toronto?
● WTF!
● While I file federal complaints....
● Websites that track flight prices over time
● How is this legal!
#6 Airline Rate Fluctuations
New York to Edmonton Via Toronto
Toronto to Edmonton
Same Flight! 
Same Day!
#6 Airline Rate Fluctuations
● Not just the TSA with the rectal probe at the 
airport
● Probably happens a lot, many airlines
● Website to scrape this kind of data and flag 
discrepancies, or...
● Find connections that are cheaper and just not 
take the second leg
● Give consumers the tools to file complaints, 
fight back
● farecast.com w/o the Microsoft buyout
#7 There's Too Much Security!
#7 There's Too Much Security!
● Don't throw anything (It's not Shmoocon!)
● Pushing the envelope does wonderful things
● Is that the best use for our talents and time?
● Freezing RAM to extract crypto is cool, but...
● Botnet sizes show more is needed to be done 
on the basic, before we work on the advanced
#7 There's Too Much Security
● Uncertainty principal/Observer effect – If we 
observe problems in a protocol or product, we 
cause a change, usually increased scrutiny by 
bad guys
● Debian RNG bug was a year old, did it matter?
● How do you get Joe Public to actually do 
something about the bug you found?
● If we can find ways of stopping the source of 
problems, the unknown realm won't matter as 
much
#7 There's Too Much Security!
● Protecting against one-off, low probability 
attacks instead of making the basics easy
● See thing #1, WPA-Radius instructions
● Nessus Feed changes
● Security compass exploit-me tools
● Easy to use instructions and products to help 
those who need it
● Welcome discussion later
#8 We have No Skills
#8 We Have No Skills
● During Hackcon in Norway, Visited Norweigan 
resistance museum with handful of other 
hackers
● We suck compared to the stuff these guys 
pulled off.  They were true hackers
● We have a passion for exploration and 
exploitation but have we forgotten where we 
came from?
● How many of you can identify this:
#8 We Have No Skills
#8 We Have No Skills
● It's a Fox Hole radio
● How many could build one?
● Many of us would be clueless/useless without 
our high tech
● Proposal for next year: Hacker Survival Skills 
Class
● Old school improvised tech and skills for being 
useful if things hit the fan
#9 Unpaid Debts
#9 Unpaid Debts
● “You owe me a beer for that”
● “Thanks, I owe you a beer”
● No simple way to track the 'beer economy' at 
cons
● Need web programmer for beer-tracker.com
● Mechanism for tracking beer debt and credit
● Print out report at con time and settle debts
#9 Unpaid Debts
● Possible Beer 'currencies': 1 Guiness = 24 
PBR's?
● Cross settling of debts
● A Karma system, but with Beer
● Need a web programmer to help build it
● Start with Defcon, maybe throw it open to other 
cons and frat houses
#10 Encryption Products
#10 Encryption Products
● Recent descision means border is a no-mans 
land
● Random laptop search, don't have anything to 
hide, don't have everything to share
● Like many, I dual boot; Most if not all full drive 
crypto products won't dual boot
● Truecrypt is Open-Source, someone please fix 
this
● Goes back to #1, make it easy to use
Conclusion
● Feel free to question/challenge/berate me after 
I get off stage
● I'll be in the wireless village
● Tool evolution milestones are already posted in 
the wireless village
● Looking for volunteers for next year to teach 
oldschool hacker survival tactics
Thank You
