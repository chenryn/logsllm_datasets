## 6.3 Link Analysis
The Maltego platform allows for the creation of arbitrary data querying constructs known as transforms, which are run against entities. A sample of transforms from the Wi-Fi suite is presented in Table 5.

### Table 5 - Wi-Fi Transforms
| Input Entity   | Transform       | Output Entities       |
|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Base of Operations | fetchDrones   | Drone                 |
| Drone         | fetchLocations  | Location              |
| Drone         | fetchClients    | Client device         |
| Client device | fetchSSIDs      | SSID                  |
| SSID          | fetchObservations | Observation           |
| SSID          | fetchSSIDLocation | Address               |
| Address       | fetchClients    | Client                |
| Client        | fetchNearbySSIDs | SSID                  |
| Domain        | fetchDomains    | Domain                |
| Domain        | fetchCookies    | Cookie                |
| Facebook      | fetchFacebook   | Facebook              |
| Facebook      | fetchFriends    | Facebook              |

Furthermore, filtering can be performed by drone, location, or observation date/time. For example, it is possible to query all devices observed in Finsbury Park on March 11, 2014, between 1 PM and 1:30 PM.

### 6.3.1 Shared Location
It is possible to query the database for devices that have some value in common. For example, searching for all mobile phones that are looking for a common SSID, but ignoring generic results (such as "Starbucks"). This can quickly disclose relationships such as work colleagues (devices looking for an SSID at a determined business address) or family members (devices looking for an SSID at a known residence). **Figure 9** illustrates four devices searching for the same network RBS-1-1111, which was geolocated to a Royal Bank of Scotland Branch in Liverpool Street. This observation was made on a train into London.

### 6.3.2 Known Prior Location
It is possible to determine whether any nearby devices have visited a predetermined location either by having previously collected data at the prior location, or by having information about the prior location that can be queried. For example, it is possible to search for all known AP SSIDs from an address and query the database to see if any devices within our proximity have searched for any of those SSIDs.

**Figure 10** illustrates this by querying all AP SSIDs within a 200m radius of the SensePost office (as determined by a photograph on the SensePost website with EXIF data). Each returned SSID is then queried to see if any observed devices have ever searched for one of those SSIDs. In this real-world (but redacted) example, four SensePost devices were discovered at Black Hat 2013. Each of those discovered devices could be queried further to discover personal information about SensePost employees.

### 6.3.3 Multi-hop Analysis
**Figure 11** depicts the end of a several-step investigation. An Apple device of interest was noted to be at three locations: Starbucks, Hyde Park, and Heathrow airport. The analyst then queried the SSIDs of networks the device was looking for, which revealed numerous results; each SSID was then queried to see if any other devices had been searching for any of the same networks, which revealed a BlackBerry device also searching for the AGMC_GUEST network. This implies that both devices have visited the same location at some point in the past (not necessarily simultaneously). This SSID is geolocated to Dubai, and an address and street view photograph is retrieved.

The same process is conducted with the BlackBerry device, which reveals a third link: an HTC device searching for the common Verizon SSID. This is geolocated to San Francisco. At this point, active traffic interception was conducted against all three devices, from which Facebook profiles were acquired for two, revealing common friends. This result reinforces the original hypothesis that the owners of the HTC and BlackBerry know each other.

## 6.4 Other Scenarios
### 6.4.1 Finding the Spy
Assume that drones are running at numerous locations – from hotels to airports to rail stations. Partial intelligence is received that a person of interest will arrive during a certain week, check into one of three hotels, and depart via one of two train stations a week later. It would be possible to look for overlap of one (or a few) devices from the locations and temporal information to isolate the target.

### 6.4.2 Discovering a Celebrity
If we know a celebrity’s schedule, we can attempt to be within proximity of that person at numerous events and observe the overlap of devices observed at multiple events. This process would be repeated until only one device was observed at all events that the target celebrity attended.

### 6.4.3 Understanding Customers
Customer tracking was discussed in Section 4.1 and is currently an area of much debate regarding privacy and invasion. It would be of great interest to a retail store to have drones deployed at numerous stores to track how long customers spend in stores, how they migrate between stores, and the effects of promotions or other external factors on numbers.

### 6.4.4 Catching Criminals
Suppose an entire city is covered with drones. If a crime is committed at a location, historical records could be investigated to determine devices present near the scene of the crime. Alternatively, suppose a riot is taking place in a city. Aerial drones could be flown overhead to collect device signatures from the rioters below, and used for future prosecution or to discover the identities of the persons on the ground.

## 7. Opting Out / Defenses
If a consumer does not want to be tracked based on the discussions in this paper, they should take care to be aware of their own footprint. Take note of every electronic device carried on your person, and determine what wireless technologies are in use and how unique the signals emitted are. The Snoopy framework is a useful tool for assessing one’s own footprint before those for whom you would not want to know it capture it.

## 8. Future Work
Additional research is planned for fixed-wing aerial units due to considerably longer flight time, as well as optimizations and additional interfaces to the framework as a whole. As new wireless technologies are released, additional plugins will be added to the framework.

## 9. Conclusions
In this paper, the unique signatures that mobile devices emit were introduced. From this initial observation, a hypothesis was constructed with the intention of tracking people based on devices they carry and discovering personal information about them. Numerous wireless technologies were discussed, identifying their range and possible fingerprint. The Snoopy framework was then introduced as a distributed, tracking, profiling, data interception, and analysis tool. The framework is technology-agnostic and can be used to track any signature for which a suitable Python plugin can be written. Result data was discussed from field experiments with the framework, and additional hypothetical scenarios were discussed. Finally, advice was given on how to be aware of one’s own footprint, as well as a mention for future work.
