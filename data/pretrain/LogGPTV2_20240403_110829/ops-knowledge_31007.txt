User: Create a new user and add it to the sudoers list so that the user can perform root-level operations
Assistant: The following are the steps to create a new user and add it to the sudoers list under the Ubuntu system: 1. Log in to the system as the root user. Create a new user with the following command: ``` adduser <username> ``` where `<username>` is the username of the new user. 2. Set a password for the new user: ``` passwd <username> ``` 3. Add the new user to the sudoers list. This can be done by editing the `/etc/sudoers` file: ``` visudo ``` find the following line: ``` # User privilege specification root ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL ``` below this line Add the following: ``` <username> ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL ``` Save and close the file. Now that the new user has been added to the sudoers list, root level operations can be performed using the sudo command.
