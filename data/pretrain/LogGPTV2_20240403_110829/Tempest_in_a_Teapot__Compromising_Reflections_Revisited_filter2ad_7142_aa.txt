Abstract
Reﬂecting objects such as tea pots and glasses, but also
diffusely reﬂecting objects such as a user’s shirt, can be used
to spy on conﬁdential data displayed on a monitor. First, we
show how reﬂections in the user’s eye can be exploited for
spying on conﬁdential data. Second, we investigate to what
extent monitor images can be reconstructed from the diffuse
reﬂections on a wall or the user’s clothes, and provide
information-theoretic bounds limiting this type of attack.
Third, we evaluate the effectiveness of several countermea-
sures. This substantially improves previous work (Backes et
al., IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, 2008).
1. Introduction
Emanations leaking potential conﬁdential
information,
from computers or similar devices, have been a topic of
concern for a long time. Although the military had prior
knowledge [34], [14], techniques to use the electromagnetic
emanation of CRT monitors to reconstruct a monitor’s
content were publicly known only by 1985 [31]. This
technique was further reﬁned and applied to similar types
of emanation, e.g., to capture the monitor’s content from
the emanations of the cable connecting the monitor and the
computer [15].
Prior work [3] presented a novel method to exploit the
optical, i.e., the unavoidable emanation of every monitor, not
just CRT monitors. It showed how to exploit tiny reﬂections
in a variety of objects to spy on conﬁdential data displayed
on a computer monitor. Appropriate objects are typically
located in most ofﬁces. This approach used astronomic
telescopes and digital cameras. While the idea seems simple,
capturing images of high resolution over large distances is
not easy and is limited by physical phenomena, particularly
by diffraction.
What makes the attack based on observing reﬂections par-
ticularly interesting is that (i) it exploits emanations that are
not a side-product of computation (such as electromagnetic
emanations) but rather are part of the normal operation,
and (ii) it works with any type of monitor. In fact, this
attack is the only known attack based on emanations that
applies to today’s typical environments, where CRT monitors
have been replaced by TFT monitors and electromagnetic
radiation can be (and in highly-sensitive areas actually is)
shielded.
1.1. Our Contributions
While previous work relied on the presence of stationary
reﬂecting objects, we show that even in the absence of such
objects, privacy is not necessarily guaranteed. First, we show
that reﬂections in the user’s eye can be exploited. Second,
we show that diffuse reﬂections from a wall or a shirt can
be used to reconstruct the monitor image.
Capturing reﬂections from the human eye is particularly
interesting, as the eye is present in essentially any environ-
ment where sensitive information is displayed. This attack
thus poses a threat much more difﬁcult to mitigate. While
the possibility to spy on reﬂections in the eye was mentioned
in previous work [3], only basic shapes could be captured
(Figure 1).
We fundamentally improve previous results (Figure 2).
For the human eye, we can read 36pt font from a distance
of 10 meters, while previously only 150pt font was readable
from a distance of four meters. Furthermore, we see that
the achievable distance scales linearly in the main limiting
parameter, the telescope diameter, thus we can extrapolate
our results to larger telescope diameters.
The attack is limited by three different types of blur:
out-of-focus blur caused by incorrect focus, motion blur
caused by movement of the eye, and diffraction blur caused
by the optical phenomenon of diffraction. Capturing high-
resolution images over a large distance typically requires the
use of large focal length and large apertures. This, however,
results in a very small depth-of-ﬁeld, i.e., only objects that
are precisely in focus appear sharp, and objects that are
slightly out-of-focus are signiﬁcantly blurred. Consequently,
focusing is very sensitive, and out-of-focus blur can barely
be avoided during capture, in particular for moving objects
such as the human eye. Motion blur, on the other hand, is
caused by the rapid movement of the eye. Finally, diffrac-
tion blur is an optical phenomenon caused by the limited
aperture of the telescope. The aperture basically erases high
frequency parts of the image. This information is effectively
lost, thus it cannot be reconstructed from the blurred image.

eye from 4 meters.

(One exception occurs if there is a sufﬁcient amount of
additional information about the image, e.g., if it is known
that the image of a (point-like) star was captured, then the
exact location of the star can be determined even in the
presence of diffraction blur.)
In computer graphics, blur is described by a point spread
function (PSF) which models the redistribution of energy
from each point of the (unobservable) sharp image to each
point of the blurred image. Our task is, given a description
of the PSF and the blurred image, to reconstruct the sharp
image. This is known as (non-blind) deconvolution.
We demonstrate how to use image deconvolution algo-
rithms to improve the image quality. We show that both
motion blur and out-of-focus blur can be efﬁciently removed,
whereas diffraction blur cannot effectively be countered and
thus constitutes a fundamental limitation to the applicability
of the attack.
One central challenge is to measure the PSF. While decon-
volution algorithms exist that determine the PSF in the pro-
cess of deconvolution (blind deconvolution), their running
time and their output quality are worse than those of non-
blind deconvolution algorithms, which are given the PSF.
We identiﬁed and tested two possible practical approaches
to determine the PSF. First, we captured several PSFs that
result from different
levels of out-of-focus blur upfront
(ofﬂine) and use this information later in deconvolution.
This approach works very well if there is only out-of-focus
blur present (see Section 2.4). It cannot, however, handle
motion blur. Therefore, we explored another approach (see
Section 2.5) where we measure the PSF when we take the
picture, simultaneously measuring motion blur and out-of-
focus blur. This approach requires a small amount of extra
hardware, but works very well in practice.
Our results get close to the diffraction limit, i.e., we are
essentially able to obtain the physical optimum. This in turns
lets us eliminate the possibility of further improvements and
provides a bound on the applicability of this type of attacks.
Another type of attack we explore is based on diffuse
reﬂections. The possibility that one could spy on conﬁdential
data exploiting diffuse reﬂections, e.g., reﬂections on a white
wall, was brieﬂy mentioned in [3]. In this work we take a
systematic approach and show information-theoretic limits
of the attack. Our approach is different from the attack
presented in [13], which exploits temporal variations of the
diffuse reﬂections and thus is restricted to CRT monitors,
a technology that is rarely used nowadays. In contrast, our
approach uses spatial variations only and is applicable to
any monitor technology. (Ironically, the user’s attempt to
increase his privacy may actually lead to weaker privacy:
We found that the reconstruction works better if the user
is using a privacy ﬁlter to protect himself from somebody
spying over his shoulder: these ﬁlters direct the light coming
from the monitor, thus decreasing the size of the point-spread
function.)
We evaluated the effectiveness and applicability of several
countermeasures. In particular, we showed that deploying
polarization ﬁlters on the window to block the (polarized)
light emitted by the monitor does not offer reasonable
protection in practice. (This countermeasure was suggested
by the audience at the IEEE Symposium on Security &
Privacy 2008.) We propose a novel countermeasure based
on optical notch ﬁlters, which conceptually provides much
better protection.
Finally, for the sake of exposition, we mount the attack
in-ﬁeld on stationary reﬂecting objects, showing its practical
applicability.
While the techniques we used are considerably more
involved than what was used in previous work, neither hard-
ware nor software requirements are prohibitively expensive.
Our improvements do not only affect image quality for
pictures of the eye: Reﬂections in other objects can also
be captured with much higher quality using our improved
tools.
1.2. Further Related Work
It has been rumored that military organizations have been
investigating compromising emanations since the 1960’s; the
results of this work, however, are conﬁdential. The ﬁrst pub-
licly known attack we are aware of was published in 1985,
and used electromagnetic radiation of CRT monitors [31].
An early discussion of these results can be found in [11].

Since then, various forms of emanations have been ex-
ploited to spy on conﬁdential data. Electromagnetic emana-
tions that constitute a security threat to computer equipment
result from poorly shielded RS-232 serial lines [28], key-
boards [1], as well as the digital cable connecting modern
LCD monitors [15]. We refer to [16] for a discussion of
the security limits for electromagnetic emanation. Acoustic
emanations were shown to reveal text typed on ordinary
keyboards [2], [37], as well as information about the CPU
state and the instructions that are executed [27]. Acoustic
emanations from printers were studied in [6]. The time-
varying diffuse reﬂections of the light emitted by a CRT
monitor can be exploited to recover the original monitor
image [13]. This approach exploits the point-wise image
construction and the time-characteristics of the light-emitting
material used in CRT monitors and consequently does not
apply to monitors that do not construct
images in this
fashion, such as LCD monitors. Information leakage from
status LEDs is studied in [17]. Prior to [3], reﬂections of
images in a human eye were already mentioned by Nishino
and Nayar [19], but without security questions in mind,
in particular only for low resolutions, small distances, and
without proposing technical and algorithmic approaches to
extend the resolution.
A comprehensive description of astronomic image pro-
cessing, including various imaging systems, practical acqui-
sition and advanced post-processing techniques is provided
in [4]. The application of deconvolution to astronomic
imaging is surveyed in [29]. The Richardson-Lucy (RL)
deconvolution was described in [24], [18]. Other common
(non-blind) deconvolution algorithms include van Cittert
deconvolution [7] and the Wiener ﬁlter [33]. Furthermore,
modiﬁed camera designs, including a synthetic high-speed
shutter operated with coded temporal patterns [30] or a pat-
terned mask at the aperture plane [23], have been proposed
to counteract motion or out-of-focus blur, respectively. Yuan
et al. [35] presented a technique for combining a pair of short
and long exposure images to remove the motion blur from
the brighter image while keeping its color ﬁdelity.
1.3. Structure of the Paper
In Section 2, we consider reﬂections in the human eye. In
Section 3, we describe how to reconstruct diffuse reﬂections
and give bounds for the reconstruction. In Section 4, we
show that known countermeasures do not provide reasonable
protection and propose a new one to circumvent these prob-
lems. Section 5 describes the attack in-ﬁeld. We conclude
with Section 6.
2. Reﬂections in the Eye
The human eye produces very sharp reﬂections, as exper-
iments from a short distance show [3]. In principle, this
enables us to exploit the reﬂections in the user’s eye to
spy on the monitor. However, in practice it is very difﬁcult
to capture these reﬂections, as noise and blur substantially
reduce the image quality. First, the eye’s strong curvature
(the cornea of a typical human eye has a radius of approx-
imately 7.8 mm. [19], [12]) requires strong magniﬁcation

600 nm (green/yellow), and is larger than 50% over the
whole range of visible light [26]. Its resolution is sufﬁciently
high for our purposes, and the price is reasonable (approx.
6000 USD).
Second, we used a better telescope, a Celestron C9.25
Schmidt-Cassegrain. The Schmidt-Cassegrain construction
is very compact compared to the classical Newton-design (it
has a length of 580 mm and a focal length of 2350 mm), and
typically has better image quality (although there are high-
quality Newton telescopes as well), but are more expensive
than (simple) Newtons. Compared with the telescope used
in previous work [3], this telescope offers a slightly larger
diameter and better coating, which leads to an additional
