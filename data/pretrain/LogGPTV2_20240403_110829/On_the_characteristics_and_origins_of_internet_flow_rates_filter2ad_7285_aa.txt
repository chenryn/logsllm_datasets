ABSTRACT
This paper considers the distribution of the rates at which
ﬂows transmit data, and the causes of these rates. First,
using packet level traces from several Internet links, and
summary ﬂow statistics from an ISP backbone, we examine
Internet ﬂow rates and the relationship between the rate
and other ﬂow characteristics such as size and duration. We
ﬁnd, as have others, that while the distribution of ﬂow rates
is skewed, it is not as highly skewed as the distribution of
ﬂow sizes. We also ﬁnd that for large ﬂows the size and rate
are highly correlated. Second, we attempt to determine the
cause of the rates at which ﬂows transmit data by developing
a tool, T-RAT, to analyze packet-level TCP dynamics. In
our traces, the most frequent causes appear to be network
congestion and receiver window limits.

INTRODUCTION
Researchers have investigated many aspects of Internet
traﬃc, including characteristics of aggregate traﬃc [8, 16],
the sizes of ﬁles transferred, traﬃc of particular applications
[4] and routing stability [7, 17], to name a few. One area
that has received comparatively little attention is the rate
at which applications or ﬂows transmit data in the Inter-
net. This rate can be aﬀected by any of a number of fac-
tors, including, for example, application limits on the rate
at which data is generated, bottleneck link bandwidth, net-
work congestion, the total amount of data the application

has to transmit, whether or not the application uses conges-
tion control, and host buﬀer limitations. An Internet link
may well contain traﬃc aggregated from many ﬂows lim-
ited by diﬀerent factors elsewhere in the network. While
each of these factors is well understood in isolation, we have
very little knowledge about their prevalence and eﬀect in
the current Internet. In particular, we don’t have a good
understanding of the rates typically achieved by ﬂows, nor
are we aware of the dominant limiting factors.
A better understanding of the nature and origin of ﬂow
rates in the Internet is important for several reasons. First,
to understand the extent to which application performance
would be improved by increased transmission rates, we must
ﬁrst know what is limiting their transmission rate. Flows
limited by network congestion are in need of drastically dif-
ferent attention than ﬂows limited by host buﬀer sizes. Fur-
ther, many router algorithms to control per-ﬂow bandwidth
algorithms have been proposed, and the performance and
scalability of some of these algorithm depends on the nature
of the ﬂow rates seen at routers [9, 10, 14]. Thus, know-
ing more about these rates may inform the design of such
algorithms. Finally, knowledge about the rates and their
causes may lead to better models of Internet traﬃc. Such
models could be useful in generating simulation workloads
and studying a variety of network problems.
In this paper we use data from packet traces and sum-
mary ﬂow level statistics collected on backbone routers and
access links to study the characteristics and origins of ﬂow
rates in the Internet. Speciﬁcally, we examine the distri-
bution of ﬂow rates seen on Internet links, and investigate
the relationship between ﬂow rates and other characteris-
tics of ﬂows such as their size and duration. Given these
macroscopic statistics, we then attempt to understand the
causes behind these ﬂow rates. We have developed a tool,
called T-RAT, which analyzes traces of TCP connections
and infers which causes among several possibilities limited
the transmission rates of the ﬂows.
Among our signiﬁcant ﬁndings are the following. First,
conﬁrming what has been observed previously, the distri-
bution of ﬂow rates is skewed, but not as highly skewed
as ﬂow sizes. Second, we ﬁnd, somewhat surprisingly, that
ﬂow rates strongly correlated with ﬂow sizes. This is strong
evidence that user behavior, as evidenced by the amount
of data they transfer, is not intrinsically determined, but
rather, is a function of the speed at which ﬁles can be down-
loaded. Finally, using our analysis tool on several packet
traces, we ﬁnd that the dominant rate limiting factors ap-
pear to be congestion and receiver window limits. We then

examine the distribution of ﬂow rates among ﬂows in the
same causal class (i.e., ﬂows whose rate is limited by the
same factor).
While we believe our study is the ﬁrst of its kind to exam-
ine the causes of Internet ﬂow rates and relate these causes
to other ﬂow characteristics, it is by no means the last word
in this area. This paper raises the question, but it leaves
many issues unaddressed. However, the value in our work
is a new tool that allows for further investigation of this
problem, and an initial look at the answers it can provide.
Also, while we address ﬂow rates from a somewhat diﬀer-
ent angle, our paper is not the ﬁrst to study Internet ﬂow
rates. A preliminary look at Internet ﬂow rates in a small
number of packet traces found the distribution of rates to
be skewed, but not as highly skewed as the ﬂow size distri-
bution [14]. This result was consistent with observation in
[10] that a small number of ﬂows accounted for a signiﬁcant
number of the total bytes. In recent work, Sarvotham et al
[20] found that a single high rate ﬂow usually accounts for
the burstiness in aggregate traﬃc. In [2], the authors look at
the distribution of throughput across connections between
hosts and a web server and ﬁnd that the rates are often con-
sistent with a log-normal distribution. These papers have all
made important observations. In this paper, we aim to go
beyond this previous work, looking at ﬂow rates making up
aggregate traﬃc and attempting to understand their causes.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next
section we describe the data sets and methodology used in
this study. In Section 3 we present various statistics con-
cerning ﬂow rates and related measures. We then describe
our rate analyzing tool in Section 4, describe our eﬀorts to
validate its performance in Section 5, and present results of
applying it to packet traces in Section 6. We present some
conclusions in Section 7.
2. DATASETS AND METHODOLOGY
We used data from two sources in our study. The ﬁrst
set of data consisted of 8 packet traces collected over a 14
month period. The traces were collected at high speed ac-
cess links connecting two sites to the Internet; a peering link
between two Tier 1 providers; and two sites on a backbone
network. The latter 3 traces were sampled pseudo-randomly
(using a hash on the packet header ﬁelds) at a rate of 1/256.
Sampling was on a per-ﬂow basis, so that all packets from
a sampled ﬂow were captured. The packet monitors at the
access links saw all traﬃc going between the monitored sites
and the Internet, so both directions of connections were in-
cluded in the traces. For the other traces, because of asym-
metric routing often only one direction of a connection is
visible. The ﬁnite duration of the traces (30 minutes to 2
hours) introduces a bias against the largest and most long-
lived ﬂows. However, the eﬀect of truncation on ﬂow rates,
the statistic in which we are most interested, should not be
signiﬁcant. The characteristics of the traces are summarized
in Table 1.
We supplemented the packet level traces with summary
ﬂow level statistics from 19 backbone routers in a Tier 1
provider. Data was collected for 24 hours from the 19 routers
on each of 4 days between July, 2000 and November, 2001,
yielding 76 sets of data. Because this data was collected
concurrently from routers in the same backbone provider, a
single ﬂow can be present in more than one of the datasets.
We do not know how often this occurred. However, the
19 routers represent a relatively small fraction of the provider’s
routers, so we expect that each dataset contains a relatively
unique set of ﬂows.
Records in these datasets contain the IP addresses of the
endpoints, port numbers, higher layer protocol, the start
time and end time for the ﬂow, the total number of packets
and the total number of bytes. Since these datasets lack
packet level details, we cannot use them for the trace analy-
sis in Section 4. However, they provide a useful supplement
to our results in Section 3, greatly broadening the scope of
the data beyond the limited number of packet traces. Each
of the 4 days of summary statistics represents between 4 and
6 billion packets and between 1.5 and 2.5 terabytes of data.
Flows can be deﬁned by either their source and destina-
tion addresses, or by addresses, port numbers and protocol.
The appropriateness of a deﬁnition depends in part on what
one is studying. For instance, when studying router deﬁni-
tions that do per-ﬂow processing, the former deﬁnition may
be appropriate. When examining the characteristics of in-
dividual transport layer connections the latter is preferred.
For the results reported in this paper, we used the 5-tuple
of IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol number. We
also generated results deﬁning ﬂows by source and destina-
tion IP addresses only. Those results are not qualitatively
diﬀerent. Also, for the results presented here, we used a
60 second timeout to decide that an idle ﬂow has termi-
nated. Repeating the tests with a 15 second timeout again
did not qualitatively aﬀect the results.
In the analysis that follows we report on some basic per-
ﬂow statistics, including ﬂow size, duration and rate. Size
is merely the aggregate number of bytes transferred in the
ﬂow (including headers), and duration is the time elapsed
between the ﬁrst and last packets of a ﬂow. Flow rate is
also straightforward (size divided by duration) with the ex-
ception that determining a ﬂow rate for very short ﬂows is

problematic. In particular, rate is not well-deﬁned for single
packet ﬂows whose duration by deﬁnition is zero. Similarly,
ﬂows of very short (but non-zero) duration also present a
problem. It does not seem reasonable to say that a 2-packet
ﬂow that sends these packets back-to-back has an average
rate equal to the line rate.
In general, since we are most
interested in the rate at which applications transmit data,
when calculating rates we ignore ﬂows of duration less than
100 msec, since the timing of these ﬂows’ packets may be
determined as much by queueing delays inside the network
as by actual transmission times at the source.
3. CHARACTERISTICS
In this section we examine the characteristics of Inter-
net ﬂows. We begin by looking at the distributions of rate,
size and duration, before turning to the question of relation-
ships among them. Throughout, we start with data from the
packet traces, and then supplement this with the summary
ﬂow data.
3.1 Rate Distribution
Figure 1 plots the complementary distribution of ﬂow
rates, for ﬂows lasting longer than 100 msec, in the 8 packet
traces. The distributions show that average rates vary over
several orders of magnitude. Most ﬂows are relatively slow,
with average rates less than 10kbps. However, the fastest
ﬂows in each trace transmit at rates above 1Mbps; in some
traces the top speed is over 10Mbps. For comparison, we
also show the complementary distributions of ﬂow size and
duration in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The striking dif-
ference here is the longer tail evident in the distributions of
ﬂow sizes for the packet traces. One possible explanation
of this diﬀerence is that ﬁle sizes are potentially unbounded
while ﬂow rates are constrained by link bandwidths.
A previous study of rate distributions at a web server sug-
gested that the rate distributions were well described by a
