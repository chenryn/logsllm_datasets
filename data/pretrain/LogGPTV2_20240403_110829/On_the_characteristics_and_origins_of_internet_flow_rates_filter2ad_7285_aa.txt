## Abstract
This paper investigates the distribution of data transmission rates for internet flows and the factors that influence these rates. Using packet-level traces from various internet links and summary flow statistics from an ISP backbone, we analyze the relationship between flow rates and other characteristics such as size and duration. We find that while the distribution of flow rates is skewed, it is not as highly skewed as the distribution of flow sizes. Additionally, for large flows, the size and rate are highly correlated. To determine the causes of these flow rates, we developed a tool called T-RAT, which analyzes TCP dynamics at the packet level. Our analysis indicates that network congestion and receiver window limits are the most frequent causes of flow rates.

## 1. Introduction
Researchers have extensively studied various aspects of internet traffic, including aggregate traffic characteristics, file transfer sizes, application-specific traffic, and routing stability. However, the rate at which applications or flows transmit data in the internet has received relatively less attention. This rate can be influenced by several factors, such as application-generated data rates, bottleneck link bandwidth, network congestion, the total amount of data to be transmitted, use of congestion control, and host buffer limitations. An internet link may carry aggregated traffic from many flows, each limited by different factors. While each factor is well understood individually, their combined effects and prevalence in the current internet are not well known. Specifically, we lack a comprehensive understanding of typical flow rates and the dominant limiting factors.

Understanding the nature and origin of flow rates in the internet is crucial for several reasons:
1. **Application Performance:** To improve application performance, it is essential to identify what limits their transmission rates. Flows limited by network congestion require different solutions than those limited by host buffer sizes.
2. **Router Algorithms:** Many algorithms for controlling per-flow bandwidth have been proposed, and their performance and scalability depend on the nature of the flow rates observed at routers. Better knowledge of these rates can inform the design of such algorithms.
3. **Traffic Models:** Understanding flow rates and their causes can lead to better models of internet traffic, which are useful for generating simulation workloads and studying various network problems.

In this paper, we use data from packet traces and summary flow statistics collected on backbone routers and access links to study the characteristics and origins of flow rates in the internet. We examine the distribution of flow rates and investigate their relationship with other flow characteristics such as size and duration. We also develop a tool, T-RAT, to analyze TCP connections and infer the causes of the observed flow rates.

Our key findings include:
- The distribution of flow rates is skewed but not as highly skewed as the distribution of flow sizes.
- Flow rates are strongly correlated with flow sizes, suggesting that user behavior (as indicated by the amount of data transferred) is influenced by the speed at which files can be downloaded.
- The dominant rate-limiting factors appear to be network congestion and receiver window limits.

While our study provides new insights, it is not exhaustive. We raise important questions and provide a tool for further investigation. Previous studies have made valuable observations about flow rates, and our work aims to build on this by examining the causes of these rates in more detail.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the datasets and methodology used in our study. Section 3 presents various statistics concerning flow rates and related measures. Section 4 introduces our rate analyzing tool, T-RAT. Section 5 describes our efforts to validate its performance, and Section 6 presents the results of applying T-RAT to packet traces. Finally, Section 7 offers some conclusions.

## 2. Datasets and Methodology
We used two primary sources of data in our study:
1. **Packet Traces:** We collected 8 packet traces over a 14-month period from high-speed access links, a peering link between two Tier 1 providers, and two sites on a backbone network. The latter three traces were sampled pseudo-randomly at a rate of 1/256. Sampling was done on a per-flow basis, ensuring that all packets from a sampled flow were captured. The packet monitors at the access links captured all traffic going between the monitored sites and the internet, including both directions of connections. For the other traces, only one direction of a connection was often visible due to asymmetric routing. The characteristics of these traces are summarized in Table 1.

   | Trace       | Date         | Length    | # Packets | Sampled Bidirectional |
   |-------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
   | Access1a    | Jan. 16, 2001| 2 hours   | 22 million| Yes                   |
   | Access1b    | Dec 13, 2001 | 30 minutes| 5.5 million| Yes                   |
   | Access1c    | Jan. 3, 2002 | 1 hour    | 32 million| Yes                   |
   | Access2     | Jan. 2, 2002 | 1 day     | 10 million| 1 in 256              |
   | Peering1    | Jan. 24, 2001| 45 minutes| 34 million| No                    |
   | Regional1a  | Jan. 2, 2002 | 1 hour    | 1.2 million| 1 in 256              |
   | Regional1b  | Jan. 3, 2002 | 2 hours   | 2.3 million| 1 in 256              |
   | Regional2   | Jan. 3, 2002 | 2 hours   | 5 million  | 1 in 256              |

2. **Summary Flow Statistics:** We supplemented the packet-level traces with summary flow-level statistics from 19 backbone routers in a Tier 1 provider. Data was collected for 24 hours from the 19 routers on each of 4 days between July 2000 and November 2001, yielding 76 sets of data. Each dataset contains IP addresses, port numbers, higher-layer protocol, start and end times, total number of packets, and total number of bytes. These datasets, while lacking packet-level details, provide a broader scope of data beyond the limited number of packet traces.

Flows were defined using either source and destination addresses or a 5-tuple of IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol number. We used a 60-second timeout to determine when an idle flow had terminated. Repeating the tests with a 15-second timeout did not qualitatively affect the results.

## 3. Characteristics
In this section, we examine the characteristics of internet flows, focusing on the distributions of rate, size, and duration, and their relationships. We begin with data from the packet traces and then supplement this with summary flow data.

### 3.1 Rate Distribution
Figure 1 shows the complementary distribution of flow rates for flows lasting longer than 100 milliseconds in the 8 packet traces. The distributions indicate that average rates vary over several orders of magnitude. Most flows are relatively slow, with average rates less than 10 kbps. However, the fastest flows in each trace transmit at rates above 1 Mbps, with some reaching over 10 Mbps. For comparison, Figures 2 and 3 show the complementary distributions of flow size and duration, respectively. The flow size distributions exhibit a longer tail, likely due to the unbounded nature of file sizes compared to the constrained nature of flow rates by link bandwidths.

A previous study of rate distributions at a web server suggested that the rate distributions were well described by a log-normal distribution. Our findings support this observation and extend it to a broader range of internet flows.

[Figures 1, 2, and 3 would be included here, showing the complementary distributions of flow rates, sizes, and durations, respectively.]

## 4. T-RAT: A Tool for Analyzing TCP Dynamics
To understand the causes of the observed flow rates, we developed a tool called T-RAT. This tool analyzes packet-level TCP dynamics and infers the limiting factors among several possibilities. T-RAT uses detailed packet-level information to identify the dominant rate-limiting factors, such as network congestion and receiver window limits.

## 5. Validation of T-RAT
We validated the performance of T-RAT using a series of controlled experiments and real-world packet traces. The validation process involved comparing the tool's inferences with known ground truths and assessing its accuracy and robustness. The results showed that T-RAT accurately identifies the primary rate-limiting factors in a wide range of scenarios.

## 6. Results
Applying T-RAT to the packet traces, we found that the most frequent causes of flow rates are network congestion and receiver window limits. We also examined the distribution of flow rates among flows in the same causal class (i.e., flows whose rate is limited by the same factor). These results provide a deeper understanding of the factors influencing internet flow rates and their interplay with other flow characteristics.

## 7. Conclusions
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the characteristics and origins of internet flow rates. We found that flow rates are skewed but not as highly skewed as flow sizes, and that flow rates are strongly correlated with flow sizes. The dominant rate-limiting factors are network congestion and receiver window limits. Our tool, T-RAT, offers a powerful means to further investigate these issues and can inform the design of more effective network management and traffic control algorithms.

Future work will focus on expanding the scope of our analysis to include a wider range of internet links and traffic types, as well as developing more sophisticated models of internet traffic based on the insights gained from this study.
