 **Migrated issue, originally created by Tiemo Kieft (@tkieft)**
I have a schema that defines some Enum's, running create_all() works fine on
Postgres, but on SQLite it locks up.
The code below demonstrates the problem:
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Enum
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    Base = declarative_base()
    e = Enum('foo', 'bar', metadata=Base.metadata)
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
Remove the explicit `metadata` kwarg from the Enum constructor solves the
problem. I tried running the above code with echo=True, but it doesn't report
anything.
