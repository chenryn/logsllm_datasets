ABSTRACT
The goal of our work is to characterize the current state of
Cuba’s access to the wider Internet. This work is motivated
by recent improvements in connectivity to the island and the
growing commercial interest following the ease of restrictions
on travel and trade with the US. In this paper, we proﬁle
Cuba’s networks, their connections to the rest of the world,
and the routes of international traﬃc going to and from
the island. Despite the addition of the ALBA-1 submarine
cable, we ﬁnd that round trip times to websites hosted
oﬀ the island remain very high; pings to popular websites
frequently took over 300 ms. We also ﬁnd a high degree
of path asymmetry in traﬃc to/from Cuba. Speciﬁcally, in
our analysis we ﬁnd that traﬃc going out of Cuba typically
travels through the ALBA-1 cable, but, surprisingly, traﬃc
on the reverse path often traverses high-latency satellite
links, adding over 200 ms to round trip times. Last, we
analyze queries to public DNS servers and SSL certiﬁcate
requests to characterize the availability of network services
in Cuba.

INTRODUCTION
It may have taken 54 years, but change is coming to
Cuba. Last December, the US government announced plans
to restore relations with Cuba and ease restrictions on travel
and trade.
It took little time for American businesses
– from the obvious tourist sector to telephony and video
streaming services – to start scouting opportunities.

de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba, S.A. (ETECSA) to provide
direct international
long distance telephony between the
USA and Cuba [16]. The same month, Netﬂix announced
their plan to oﬀer their video streaming service and two
months later Airbnb brought their sharing economy to the
island [3].
Despite the promising news, the state of Cuban infrastruc-
ture, particularly in the computing and network segment,
pose no small challenges to these plans. Today, less than
5% of the population have their own ﬁxed-line Internet
connection [18] and only an estimated 25% of the population
are able to get online [9]. Those that are actually connected
experience very poor performance. Ookla’s NetIndex, for
instance, ranks Cuba among the worst ten countries in
terms of average bandwidth – 197th out of 202 – with a
measured broadband download speed of 1.67 Mbps. An even
bigger barrier to Internet access is cost with services that are
prohibitively expensive for much of the population. While
the average monthly income in Cuba is around $20 a month,
paying by the hour at an Internet cafe can cost about $5 per
hour [19]. A broadband subscription is even more expensive
with private subscription plans costing about 386% of the
gross national income per capita [6].
Recent years have brought some progress in connecting
Cubans to the rest of the Internet and the recent commercial
interest may help speed up the process. In February of 2011,
Cuba completed its ﬁrst undersea ﬁber-optic cable, ALBA-1
(640 Gbps), with landings in Jamaica and Venezuela. The
US government has also set the promotion of Internet access
in the island as one of their top priorities [17] and the US
Department of Defense stated plans to build a submarine
cable between Florida and the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base
in Cuba and to eventually extend it to the rest of Cuba [15].
Our goal is to characterize the current state of Cuba’s
access to the wider Internet. We collected and analyzed
two months of measurements (March and April of 2015)
with probes going in and out of Cuba launched from 50
RIPE Atlas [13] nodes and our 6,000 Namehelp [12] clients.
Our analysis validates some of the anecdotal evidence on
the limited connectivity of the island. Though bandwidth
capacity to the country is severely limited, we ﬁnd that
end-to-end latency is a key bottleneck in international
network traﬃc with a large number of paths traversing
high-latency satellite links despite the availability of ALBA-
1.
Interestingly, we ﬁnd that many of the high RTT
measurements are linked to high degrees of path asymmetry
in traﬃc to/from Cuba. Speciﬁcally, most traﬃc going
out of Cuba travels through the ALBA-1 submarine cable,
487The ALBA-1 cable was not actually activated until two
years later, in January 2013 [11]. Even after the addition
of ALBA-1, Cuba’s connectivity to the rest of the Internet
remains relatively poor, even compared to other Caribbean
islands. Figure 1 shows a map of the submarine cables in
the region. Despite the large number of cables in the sur-
rounding area, Cuba is one of the least connected countries
in the region, with a number of submarine cables detouring
around the island in order to reach their destination.
Aﬀordability remains a problem, with a broadband sub-
scription costing close to 4x the gross national income per
capita [6], but in March of 2015, the Cuban government
approved the ﬁrst public Wi-Fi hub in Havana [2] potentially
improving citizens’ (and visitors’) access to the Internet.
3. DATASETS
To characterize the current state of Cuba’s connections to
the rest of the Internet we collected measurements over a
two month period (March and April, 2015). Probes going in
and out of Cuba were launched from RIPE Atlas [13] nodes
and our Namehelp [12] clients. The following paragraphs
describe our datasets in more detail.
RIPE Atlas probes. The RIPE Atlas data was collected
from approximately 50 probes across North and South
America. One probe was located in Cuba (the only available
one) and approximately half of rest were located on other
islands throughout the Caribbean, including the Dominican
Republic, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Saint Barth´elemy, Saint
Kitts and Nevis, Guadeloupe, Trinidad and Tobago, Mar-
tinique, and Grenada. The rest of the probes were located in
the US, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil. Most of our analysis
in this paper focuses on the measurements collected from the
Atlas probe located in Havana, Cuba.
The RIPE Atlas API allows us to schedule ping and
traceroute measurements, issue DNS queries, and fetch SSL
certiﬁcates on each of these nodes. We measured the routes
between each vantage point by running traceroutes between
all pairs of our selected RIPE Atlas probes. Additionally,
the RIPE Atlas probe in Cuba ran traceroute measurements
to every Namehelp endhost. To test the availability of
network services in Cuba, we had the Atlas probe in Havana
fetch SSL certiﬁcates for popular websites that supported
HTTPS. We also measured DNS performance to the probes’
conﬁgured DNS server and to a number of public DNS
services. We compared the results of these tests to other
requests issued simultaneously from the other 49 Atlas
probes. These measurements are discussed in greater detail
in Sec. 6.
Namehelp clients.
In addition to the RIPE Atlas
data, we also leveraged 6,000 endhosts running Namehelp,
with presence in over 600 networks across 78 countries.
Namehelp is a tool based on the popular DNS benchmark
utility, namebench, that aims to both provide a comparative
evaluation of DNS services and act as a DNS proxy to
improve CDN mappings. 1
Namehelp is also able to conduct controlled network
measurements, such as ping, traceroute, or wget. For
this dataset, Namehelp clients ran hourly traceroute mea-
surements to preﬁxes located in Cuba. While running
these traceroutes, Namehelp did not run any other network
measurements simultaneously. By combining this data with

but on the reverse path, responses often traverse satellite
links, typically adding over 200 ms of additional end-to-
end latency. We also survey a number of popular network
services, such as public DNS and web services, checking their
availability in Cuba, ﬁnding that some services appear to be
blocking users in the island.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we
discuss the state of Internet connectivity in Cuba. Section 3
describes the datasets that we use for our analysis. We
then discuss the domestic and international connectivity of
Cuba’s networks in Sec. 4 and look at how routing through
these connections aﬀects performance in Sec. 5. In Sec. 6,
we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings on the availability of
network services in Cuba before concluding in Sec. 7.
2. BACKGROUND
Although Cubans have been able to legally acquire a
computer since 2008 [8], getting access to the Internet
has remained a challenge. Network availability has been
problematic for such a long time that several makeshift
“oﬄine Internets” have appeared, with individuals and
companies sharing or selling content downloaded from the
Internet (e.g., ﬁlms, TV shows, magazines, news articles, or
applications) via USB ﬂash drives or CDs – a popular service
known as “El paquete” [18].
if slowly.
Things have been changing,
In early 2011,
Alcatel-Lucent began work on a submarine ﬁber-optic cable,
named ALBA-1, with landing points in Ocho Rios, Jamaica;
Siboney, Cuba; and La Guaira, Venezuela [1]. Estimates
suggested that this link would increase capacity to the island
by a factor of 3,000.
Prior to this, all traﬃc was routed to and from the
island via satellite links. These satellites are located in
geosynchronous orbit, at a distance of about 36,000 km
from the equator.
Sending a single packet from the
Earth’s surface to the satellite and back to Earth takes
approximately 2 × 36, 000 km/c = 240 ms where c is the
speed of light. Traversing a satellite link on both the forward
and reverse path would add approximately 480 ms to RTT
measurements.
488traceroutes from Namehelp users to the island, we found
that of the 20 IPv4 preﬁxes in AS27725, 15 of the preﬁxes
appeared to be consistently routed over the ALBA-1 cable
on both the forward and reverse paths. Looking at the
forward paths going into Cuba, it is clear that traceroutes
to these preﬁxes did not travel through either Intelsat’s or
NewCom’s networks (satellite link). Considering that the
end-to-end RTT was always less than 200 ms, it is also clear
that the reverse path did not traverse the satellite link as
this would have added over 230 ms.
The ﬁve remaining preﬁxes were frequently routed asym-
metrically; traﬃc traveling out of the country went through
the ALBA-1 cable into either Tata’s or Telefonica’s network,
while incoming traﬃc was, in the majority of cases, routed
through one of the satellite networks.
Using a list of popular Cuban websites [7], we also
looked at where websites under the .cu TLD were hosted
geographically. Of the websites ending with .cu that we were
able to successfully resolve, about 80% were located in the
island. Cuban websites that were located outside of Cuba
were typically in the US, France, Venezuela, or Canada. Of
the listed websites that were hosted in Cuba, about 60%
were located in a single preﬁx, 190.91.112.0/20. Domains
that were hosted in other Cuban preﬁxes were typically
government websites, in the preﬁx assigned to the respective
government organization.
5. PERFORMANCE
With an understanding of the island connectivity, we now
look at how the routing of international traﬃc to and from
Cuba aﬀects end-to-end RTT performance. We start by
looking at individual cases where asymmetry is causing a
