### A Long Time Ago, in a Land Far Away…
A VoIP penetration test took place, highlighting the concept of "Islands of VoIP."

### Islands of VoIP
**Company A**  
**Company B**  
**Company C**  

- **PSTN**  
- **SIP Trunk**  
- **TDM Trunk**  
- **Carrier**

**How to Connect "Islands of VoIP"?**  
**ENUM**

**Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent.**

---

### ENUM
**How it works:**
- Uses DNS NAPTR records to map E.164 telephone numbers to a URI (SIP URI).
- When you dial a telephone number, you don't know if it's connected to the PSTN or a SIP network.
- Solves the problem of dialing between SIP networks when you only have a telephone number.

**Adoption Rate:**
- Hasn't seen widespread adoption due to political and economic reasons.

### ENUM Experiment
**www.e164.org - Public ENUM Directory**
- They have a form and validation procedure for adding your telephone number and SIP URI to their directory.
- We attempted to add ourselves using their procedure but were unsuccessful.
- Multiple emails to their contact address went unanswered.

### No More "Islands of VoIP"!
(There has to be a better way)

**The Superior Solution: SIP Peering using DNS SRV**

**Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent.**

---

### SIP Peering using DNS SRV
- **Proposal:** Use DNS for SIP Peering to interconnect all "Islands of VoIP" directly between organizations.
- **Benefits:**
  - DNS is built for high availability and load balancing.
  - Calls via SIP URI, which are easier to remember.
  - No more dial-by-number; use your email address as your SIP URI.
  - Large cost savings for direct SIP peering.
  - Diminished reliance on the PSTN.

### DNS SRV: RFC 2782
- **Special DNS resource record for service location (SRV)**
- **Fault tolerance and load balancing:**
  - Multiple priorities and weights, similar to MX records for MTAs.
  - Clients look up lower priority records first, then fallback to records of equal or higher priority.
  - If multiple records have the same priority, the weight value is used.
- **RFC 3263 specifies usage of DNS SRV for SIP.**

### DNS SRV: Record Format

---

### DNS SRV: Sample Record
- **Source: Wikipedia**
- **Automatic load balancing group created with equal priority of “10”**
  - Weight values add up to 100.
  - 60% of traffic to bigbox
  - 20% of traffic to smallbox
  - 10% to each remaining

### SIP DNS SRV Deployment
- **Internet**
- **Company A (SIP Domain: example.com)**
- **Company B (SIP Domain: foo.com)**
- **Root DNS**
- **SIP user: PI:EMAIL**
- **Initiate SIP call to: PI:EMAIL**
- **DNS SRV: foo.com**
- **SIP INVITE**
- **RTP Media: "Hello? What’s up Bro?"**

### Research Goal
- **Objective:** Measure the growth of SIP peering on the IPv4 Internet over time.
- **Metrics:**
  - Proliferation of DNS SRV records, plotted over time.
  - Proliferation of ENUM for selected E.164 blocks, plotted over time.
  - Proliferation of listening SIP services for every IPv4 address, plotted over time.

### Introducing Enumerator Tool
- **New intelligence gathering tool developed for this research:**
  - **Tool Name:** enumerator
  - **Website:** http://enumerator.sourceforge.net
  - **Language:** C
  - **Library:** libresolv
  - **Uses:** R&D purposes or VoIP pentesting in the Recon phase
  - **Optimized for:** VoIP and a large number of domains

**Avaya Proprietary - Do not reproduce or distribute without express written consent.**

---

### Enumerator Key Features
- **DNS SRV lookups for single domain or text input list**
  - Partial support for Microsoft-specific targets
- **DNS MX lookups for single domain or text input list**
- **DNS ENUM lookups for single number or input list**

### Enumerator Phase I "Scan"
- **Ran an enumerator SRV lookup "Scan"**
- **Procured all TLDs from Network Solutions, Org:**
  - .com domains: 234,638,894 (4.231 GB)
  - .net domains: 34,232,716 (578.313 MB)
  - .org domains: 23,409,623 (430.455 MB)
  - Total: 292,281,233 domains
- **Goal:** Find the number of SRV-enabled domains potentially enabled for SIP
- **Idea:** Run several scans over a year and plot how the data changes over time

### Data Input
- **Received from Network Solutions and Org:**
  - .com domains: 234,638,894 (4.231 GB)
  - .net domains: 34,232,716 (578.313 MB)
  - .org domains: 23,409,623 (430.455 MB)
  - Total: 292,281,233 domains

### 4 SRV Target Queries
- **Benchmarking:**
  - 140 domain queries per second on each server (11 servers)
  - 4 SRV queries per domain
  - Split enumerator into 800 separate processes, 800 files
  - Command: `./enum-launcher.pl –f largefile.txt –c 800`
  - 4 SRV queries:
    - _sip._udp.
    - _sip._tcp.
    - _sip._tls.
    - _sipfederationtls._tcp.

### Results from Enumerator Scan #1
- **Total domains checked:** 265,710,178
- **Without SRV:** 256,947,303 (96.70%)
- **With SRV for SIP:** 8,762,875 (3.30%)

**8 Million TLD domains enabled for SIP SRV! (3.30%)**

### Enumerator In Action
- **Example 1:** `enumerator –s –l domains.txt` (Looks up all domains in the input file)
- **Example 2:** `enumerator –m –d example.com` (MX Record lookup of a single domain)
- **Example 3:** `enumerator –e –r 12145551212` (Looks up a single E.164 telephone number)
- **Example 4:** `enumerator –e –r 12145551212-12145559999` (Looks up a range of numbers)
- **Example 5:** `enumerator –e –l numbers.txt` (Looks up all numbers in the input file)
