# Climbing Everest: An Overview of Voting in the United States

## Introduction to Voting in the US
Voting in the United States is a highly decentralized process, with the federal government setting broad standards and each state having its own laws, rules, and requirements. Elections are typically run by counties (over 3,000 in the US), and voting takes place in neighborhood precincts, which can number from tens to thousands per county.

### Complexity of the Voting System
- **Multiple Races:** A typical election includes many races, such as for president, governor, senators, representatives, and local officials.
- **Different Ballots:** Each precinct may have several different ballots, depending on the specific races and issues being voted on.

## Federal vs. State Roles
- **Federal Government:** Sets broad standards and provides guidelines.
- **State Governments:** Establish and enforce their own election laws and regulations.

### The Help America Vote Act (HAVA)
- **Key Provisions:** For states that do not use electronic equipment to assist voters in detecting errors, they must establish a voter education program and provide voters with instructions.

## Who We Are
- **ES&S Structure:** Election Systems & Software (ES&S) is one of the leading providers of voting systems in the United States.

## Types of Voting Systems
### Direct Recording Electronic (DRE)
- **Description:** Specialized voting computers, typically with touch-screen interfaces.
- **Functionality:** Records voter selections internally.

### Precinct Counted Optical Scan
- **Process:** Voters fill out a paper ballot (e.g., filling in circles).
- **Assistance:** Ballot marking devices can assist disabled voters.
- **Counting:** The voter inserts the ballot into a precinct ballot reader, which either accepts the ballot and records the vote or rejects it and returns it to the voter.

### Centrally (County) Counted Optical Scan
- **Use:** Common for absentee ballots.
- **Process:** Ballots are collected and counted at a central location.

## Security and Reliability Concerns
### Code Complexity and Market Share
- **ES&S:** Over 670,000 lines of code, with over 40% market share.
- **Premier:** Over 334,000 lines of code, with over 40% market share.
- **Other Major Players:**
  - **Hart:** Over 300,000 lines of code.
  - **Sequoia:** Over 800,000 lines of code.
- **Note:** There is no correlation between the number of lines of code and the percentage of market share.

### Security Vulnerabilities
- **Buffer Overflows:** Highlighted security concerns.
- **Scanner Key Part Number #75506:** Example of a critical component.
- **Seals:** Important for maintaining the integrity of voting machines.
- **Port Access:** Any unauthorized access can be a major security risk.

### Notable Quotes on Security
- **John Von Neumann (1951):** "Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin."
- **Donald Knuth (The Art of Computer Programming Vol 2):** "Random numbers should not be generated with a method chosen at random."
- **Anonymous:** "The best defense against logic is ignorance."

### Backdoors and Features
- **Backdoor:** Often disguised as a feature.
- **Photo Courtesy of Brickshelf.com:** Visual example of potential vulnerabilities.
- **Micahâ€™s Hands:** Demonstrates the ease of tampering with DREs.
- **Zippedy-do-dah, Penn Lion:** Slang terms for various security issues.

### Potential Exploits
- **Paper Ballots:** Can be altered.
- **Whiteout:** Used to erase votes.
- **Non-read:** Ballots that cannot be read by scanners.
- **Cast Multiple Votes, Erase Audit Logs, Disable VVPAT, Zero Totals, IOW, *Anything*:** These actions spell PRUC, meaning Viral Propagation.

## Conclusions
- **Academic Concerns:** While some may view these issues as purely academic, they have real-world implications.
- **Safety Concerns:** The current system is unsafe at any speed.
- **What Can You Do?**
  - **VOTE!**
  - **Become a Poll Worker:**
  - **Build a Better System:**

### Final Note
- **We are going to win anyway.**
