Voting 101
Voting in the US
• Highly decentralized:
– Federal government sets broad standards
– Each state has own laws, rules, requirements
– Elections run by counties (>3000 in US)
– Voting takes place in neighborhood precincts
• tens, hundreds or thousands per county
• Complex:
– Typical election has many races
– Precinct may have several different ballots

• Favorite HAVA quote:
“For States that do not use electronic 
equipment to assist voters with ‘detecting 
errors’, they must:
             Establish a voter education program
             Provide voter with instructions*
*emphasis added
Who are we?
ES&S Structure
Computerized Voting
• Direct Recording Electronic (DRE)
– specialized voting computer, typically with touch-screen interface
– records voter selections internally
• Precinct Counted Optical Scan
– voter fills out a paper ballot (fill in circles)
• ballot marking devices can assist disabled
– voter inserts ballot into precinct ballot reader, which either accepts 
ballot and records vote or rejects and returns ballot to voter
• Centrally (County) Counted Optical Scan
– absentee ballots
