ABSTRACT 
The Workshop Digital Identity Management has evolved during the 
last  decade  as  one  of  the  most  interesting  events  on  identity 
management issues. Starting from a community with a background 
mainly 
towards  an 
interdisciplinary  workshop  where  a  lively  interactive  community 
discusses  identity  topics  from  technical,  sociological,  economical, 
legal,  psychological  and  many  more  angles.  The  goal  of  this 
workshop  is  to  share  the  latest  findings,  identify  key  challenges, 
inspire  debates,  and  foster  collaboration  between  industries  and 
academia towards interoperable identity service infrastructures.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
“Identity  at  the  crossroads”  is  the  main  theme  of  DIM  2013. 
Whereas  identity  management  has  become  a  standard  method  for 
authentication in the digital world, many of its facets that are dealt 
with  in  research  and  in  practice  are  still  not  well  understood. 
Particularly interesting are discussions which solutions are optimal 
for  different  areas  of  application,  how  we  can  promote  positive 
aspects  for  individuals  and  society  while  preventing  negative 
effects,  and  how  we  can  transfer  research  results  into  practice.

 At  the  same  time,  the  environment  of  our  digital  lives  and  of 
identity management systems is rapidly changing: 
We have seen the Internet going mobile and social: In October 
2012  the  number  of  smartphones  in  use  on  this  planet  exceeded 
1 billion and is projected to double by 2015 [1]. The global social 
network  platform  Facebook  has  passed  the  1  billion  user  mark  as 
well [2]. 
We notice adoptions of identity federation systems and other 
digital identity platforms, either enabling single sign-on for multiple 
applications  such  as  in Google Accounts or reaching out to third-
party applications such as in Facebook Connect. 
Recently,  we  have  perceived  tremendous  improvements  in 
identity  management  technologies  (see  e.g.  [3,4]),  in  particular 
when it comes to the maturity of attribute-based credential systems, 
the cryptography ensuring security and privacy properties, and other 
privacy-preserving or privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). 
We observe governments all over Europe and, indeed, all over 
the  planet  to  propose  eID  solutions  that  partially  support  privacy 
mechanisms  and  frequently  allow  the  government-issued  identity 
credentials to be tied into an identity federation ecosystem. 
in 
We  witness  advances 
technology  and  operating 
environments such as social networks, mobile devices, smartphones, 
tablets  as  well  as  upcoming  smart  TVs,  wearable  computing  (e.g. 
Google  Glass,  iWatch)  that  start  to  impact  social  habits  and 
individuals’  behavior.  The  direct experience of new technology is 
flanked by news reports on incidents, mostly on privacy violations 
and  surveillance.  Both  lead  to  questions  what  impact  on  society 
these new technologies will have. 
Identity is at the crossroads. It is an open question how identity 
technology  will  affect  societies  –  societies  that  are  affected  by 
mobile computing and social network services, by data processing 
in  the  cloud  and  almost  comprehensive  monitoring,  user  tracking 
and  big  data  analysis  by  stakeholders  such  as  the  advertisement 
industry  on  the  one  side  and  national  secret  services  on  the  other 
side, or by emerging technologies such as ubiquitous computing or 
cyber-physical  systems  where  new  user  interfaces  have  to  be 
considered. Will identity technologies make the users’ lives easier 
or will they put their privacy at risk? 
We  believe  that  the  ACM  Digital  Identity  Management 
workshop  series  needs  to  address these issues in all their breadth, 
covering  foundational  technologies  such  as  cryptography  and 
integration  with  eID  systems,  over  investigating  technology  and 
architecture challenges to be resolved to exploring the social impact 
of identity management. With the year’s workshop we have covered 
these areas, constituting a program with experts from different fields 
of identity.

The DIM 2013 workshop will be a full-day event, starting with a 
keynote  by  Claudia  Díaz,  KU  Leuven,  on  privacy-enhancing 
technologies and their role in the identity management world. Four 
sessions are constituted by accepted full and short papers, covering 
a range between cryptographic foundations and socio-psychological 
findings.  In  the  afternoon,  a  panel  will  start  with  questions 
concerning  eIDs  and  their  actual  development  from  different 
perspectives. All participants are invited to join with statements on 
shaping the future of identity – be it by tackling research topics or 
by deploying solutions for better identity management.

3.  WORKSHOP CONTRIBUTIONS 
We  clustered  the  accepted  contributions  of  eight  full  papers  and 
three short papers into four groups. Right after the invited keynote 
on  privacy-enhancing  technologies,  the  session on “Cryptographic 
Methods”  will  continue  the  elaboration  of  components  that  can 
support  privacy  and  security  features  of  identity  management 
systems:  ‘Universally  Composable  Adaptive  Oblivious  Transfer 
(with  Access  Control)  from  Standard  Assumptions’,  ‘A  Secure 
Channel 
‘UbiKiMa: 
Ubiquitous  Authentication  Using  a  Smartphone,  Migrating  from 
Passwords to Strong Cryptography’. 
The  second  session  will  focus  on  “Human  Factors  and  Socio-
Economic  Aspects”.  It  consists  of  three  contributions  that  center 
around acceptance and employment of identity-related functionality 
by users: ‘A Comparison of Users’ Perceptions of and Willingness 
to  Use  Google,  Facebook,  and  Google+  Single-Sign-On 
Functionality’, ‘Taboos and Desires of the UK Public for Identity 
Management  in  the  Future;  General  Findings  from  Two  Survey 
Games’,  and  ‘Probing  Identity  Management  –  Preliminary 
Findings’. 
Switching back to more technically oriented contributions, the 
third  session  will  deal  with  “Security  Considerations”,  e.g.  by 
showing  possible  attacks  and  counter-measures  or  other 
improvements  of  existing  systems.  The  three  contributions  are: 
‘Geo-Location  Based  QR-Code  Authentication  Scheme  to  Defeat 
Active Real-Time Phishing Attack’, ‘Towards Standardizing Trusted 
Evidence  of  Identity’,  and  ‘Reachability  Analysis  for  Role-Based 
Administration of Attributes’. 
The  last  session  of  the  workshop  on  “eIDs  and  Identity 
Management”  mixes  the  disciplines  the  contributions  come  from. 
After  the  presentation  of  a  technical  approach  for  an  eID 
architecture  in  ‘Options  for  Integrating  eID  and  SAML’  the 
perspective of citizens is highlighted by the contribution ‘Federated 
Identity to Access e-Government Services – Are Citizens Ready for 
This?’  The  findings  of  both  papers  will  be  taken  up  in  the 
concluding panel on the future of eIDs and identity management.
