ABSTRACT
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a powerful and versa-
tile access control system for large-scale access control man-
agement within an organization. Most studies so far consider
RBAC models that have a single consistent access control
policy, which implicitly conﬁne an RBAC system to one or-
ganization. However, many real-world requirements of ac-
cess control span multiple organizations; thus, there is a need
to design scalable RBAC models for such use cases. We pro-
pose a trans-organizational RBAC model that enables access
control within and across organizations. A formal deﬁnition
of trans-organizational RBAC is presented. We show that
the model is scalable in a multi-organization setup, and does
not require the creation of federations. Finally, a security
issue in the model is identiﬁed and possible approaches to
address this are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) models
such as RBAC96 [6] and NIST-RBAC [2] are designed for
a single organizational domain. However, the scope of in-
formation systems has increased in recent years, leading to
growth in the number of users, organizations, roles and per-
missions managed by a particular application. Use cases for
access control in these applications are complicated, and are
often not closed to one ﬂat organization; sometimes, a role
in one organization is referred by other organizations and
is granted with a certain permission. The security manage-
ment complexity and performance degradation of traditional
RBAC mechanisms have therefore become problematic, thus
there is a need for more scalable access control systems [5].

Figure 1: Example of a trans-organizational use
case. The IdP school assigns the role student to a
user, and the user has access to the school’s services.
SPs not in a federation with the school provide stu-
dents access to some of their services as well.
One solution to this is to create a federation of organiza-
tions similar to single-sign on systems such as the Shibboleth
System [4]. In this approach, an organization shares access
control information such as user-role assignments to other
organizations in the federation while retaining its auton-
omy [1]. However, an identity-providing organization (IdP)
might consider user-role assignments as critical and private
information, and are unwilling to share this information
with a service-providing organization (SP). In such trans-
organizational use cases, roles can be issued and honored
between independent organizations outside a federation.
Figure 1 illustrates a real-world example, where SPs pro-
vide free or discounted services to students under educa-
tional licenses or student plans. The school does not prohibit
its students from utilizing their student-roles with SPs, but
it will not agree to provide their list of students to external
organizations. Support for trans-organizational use cases
without requiring federations is therefore strongly needed
for RBAC systems.
Zhang et al. [7] proposed another approach, where a fam-
ily of Role and Organization Based Access Control (ROBAC)
models take into account multiple organizational domains.
In ROBAC, users are assigned role and organization pairs.
Using this pair, access to an asset is restricted by two rela-
tions: the user’s role must have the appropriate permissions
to access the asset, and the asset must also be mapped to an
organization. However, the authors note that there may be
instances where the number of role and organization pairs
may become large as the number of organizations increase.
817As a result, management complexity issues may arise in the
long term.
We say that an RBAC model is a trans-organizational
RBAC model if a) it can provide access control within and
across organizational domains, and b) an SP can provide
services to users who have roles managed by an IdP without
requiring both to be in a federation.
In general, an IdP
assigns users with a trans-organizational role which serves
as a role in the IdP’s RBAC system.
If an SP interprets
the trans-organizational role as a valid role in their RBAC
system, it grants permissions needed to access their services.
That is, trans-organizational roles are valid roles within and
across diﬀerent RBAC systems.
Trans-organizational RBAC inherently involves a security
issue. An SP needs to verify the user assignment of a foreign
IdP, but the SP is not allowed to make any inquiries to the
IdP. Thus, there is a need for a secure mechanism which
allows an arbitrary SP to verify the user-role assignment of
an arbitrary IdP, assuming that users are dishonest and will
attempt to assert false roles to an SP.
Given the need for scalable RBAC systems which sup-
port trans-organizational use cases without the need of fed-
erations, we therefore propose a trans-organizational RBAC
model. We extend the base model RBAC0 found in RBAC96
to include multiple organizational domains. Components
of RBAC0 are likewise extended for each organization and
additional components to support trans-organizational roles
are developed. To address the security issue described above,
we examined the representation of trans-organizational roles
using of attribute certiﬁcates and identity strings.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In
Section 2, we formally deﬁne trans-organizational RBAC
and discuss its properties. Section 3 further describes the
security issue, and outlines a preliminary investigation of
secure mechanisms to represent trans-organizational roles.
Finally, Section 4 summarizes this paper and discusses fu-
ture work.
2. TRANS-ORGANIZATIONAL RBAC
In this section, we propose a model for trans-organizational
RBAC. The characteristics of the model are presented in
Figure 2. In the following discussion, the model is deﬁned
with respect to the components found in RBAC0. For the
sake of simplicity, let us assume that IdPs and SPs are dif-
ferent sets of organizations.
ing components:
Deﬁnition 1. Trans-organizational RBAC has the follow-
• U and O, the set of users (same as in RBAC0) and the
set of organizations, respectively;
• Ro, Po and So, the set of trans-organizational roles,
permissions, and sessions managed by organization o ∈
O, respectively. To simplify the following discussion,
let us deﬁne RIdP = ∪o∈ORo where o are IdPs;
• UAo ⊆ U × Ro, a many-to-many user-role assignment
relation in organization o;
• PAo ⊆ Ro × Po, a many-to-many permission-role as-
signment relation in organization o;
• TAoj ⊆ {Roj × RIdP}, a many-to-many relation of
trans-organizational role assignments for roles {roj ⊆
Roj} of SP oj ∈ O and roles {r ⊆ RIdP};
Figure 2: Trans-organizational RBAC model.
• user : S → U , a function mapping each session sk to
a single user user(sk) (same as in RBAC0);
• org : S → O, a function mapping each session sk to
a single organization org(sk) where the session is cur-
rently established;
• roles : S → 2RIdP , a function mapping each session
sk to a set of roles roles(sk) ⊆ {r | (user(sk), r) ∈
UAo, o ∈ O}. The function gives the roles asserted
by user(sk) to org(sk) during the session (note that
during a session, a user may assert any combination
of roles assigned from IdPs, hence the function range
2RIdP );
• to roles : S → 2
Roj , a function mapping session sk
to a set of roles to roles(sk) ⊆ {r | (r, roles(sk)) ∈
TAoj , oj = org(sk)} and oj is an SP. This function, in
trans-organizational use cases, gives the SP oj ’s inter-
pretation of roles(sk) into a set of roles r ∈ Roj .
Note that many components of trans-organizational RBAC
are the same as in RBAC0. Here, the set of organizations
O is introduced, while the sets R, P and relations UA, PA
of RBAC0 are modiﬁed to represent each component for
a single organization.
In general, we assume that given
two diﬀerent organizations oi and oj , Roi ∩ Roj = ∅ and
Poi ∩ Poj = ∅; that is, each role or permission is managed
exclusively by one organization.
All organizations in O share an identical set U of users.
It follows that a user in U is allowed to have roles assigned
by multiple IdPs, and acquire services from multiple SPs by
asserting those roles.
Similar to establishing a session in RBAC0, users may ac-
tivate a subset of trans-organizational roles when accessing
the RBAC system of an SP. When a user asserts a trans-
organizational role roi , the SP oj looks for valid pairs of roles
in TAoj . If there are some roles r ⊆ Roj with (r, roi) ∈ TAoj ,
818then the user is allowed to access oj ’s RBAC system using
roles in r. If there are none (i.e., if (r, roi ) /∈ TAoj ) then no
roles are granted and the user is denied access. Note that
in this process, the SP does not to inquire the IdP about its
user-role assignments.
2.1 Properties of the Model
In the discussion above, we referred to IdPs and SPs as
diﬀerent sets of organizations. This is not a requirement
in the model; SPs can also have user-role assignments and
IdPs can have permission-role assignments. Regardless, an
organization cannot view or assign trans-organizational roles
and permissions for another organization. This is in line
with the fact that these organizations are not required to
join a federation.
Trans-organizational roles, besides being used in an SP’s
RBAC system, can also be used in an IdP’s RBAC system.
These roles can be treated as regular roles of traditional
RBAC. Therefore, increasing the number of organizations in
trans-organizational RBAC does not increase management
complexity (number of roles and permissions) in the IdP.
Management complexity in SPs increases when new trans-
organizational role assignments need to be added (e.g., when
services are made available to more roles).
Finally, one drawback of this is trans-organizational RBAC
deﬁnes how diﬀerent organizations interact with one an-
other, but RBAC systems in each organization are still im-
plemented according to a traditional RBAC model. Because
of this, trans-organizational RBAC allows systems to scale
up as the number of organizations increase, but it does not
address scalability within a speciﬁc organization.
3. PRELIMINARY RESULTS
As pointed out earlier, there is an inherent security issue
in trans-organizational RBAC without the creation of fed-
erations. When a user asserts a certain role to an SP, there
is no guarantee that the role is indeed a valid role issued by
an IdP. The SP cannot inquire IdPs about user-role assign-
ments. On the contrary, this security issue does not occur
in a federation-based approach because inquiries to the IdP
can be made.
To address this issue, we have investigated secure repre-
sentations of trans-organizational roles. One possibility is
to use attribute certiﬁcates. This approach is conventional
and we skip the technical details, but we found that this ap-
proach inherits many problems caused by using the PKI in-
frastructure. For example, SPs may need to access external
repositories to verify user-role assignments. Connectivity to
these sources thus becomes a point of failure for the system.
Another possibility is to use identity strings which con-
tain unique information about the identity of the user. To
secure identity strings, we have studied the use of hierarchi-
cal identity-based encryption (HIBE) [3], a type of public-
key encryption which uses identity strings as a public key.
Although HIBE does not solve all the problems caused by
the PKI mechanism, the veriﬁcation of user-role assignments
can be completed between the user and SP only.
Furthermore, the hierarchical nature of HIBE allows IdPs
and users to extend assigned roles with sub-roles. This may
allow implementations of a number of ﬂexible access control
mechanisms such as separation of duties, temporal revoca-
tion, delegation of keys, and contextual access. One other
advantage is that identity strings can contain role and orga-
nization pairs similar to that of ROBAC. Information about
the pairing can be made available in the naming conventions
of the identity string itself. In this case, management com-
plexity of trans-organizational RBAC does not increase sig-
niﬁcantly when large number of role and organization pairs
are needed, an issue which can arise in ROBAC.
4. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a trans-organizational RBAC model
for applications that span multiple organizations without re-
quiring federations to be created. Using RBAC0 as a basis,
an extended model was proposed. Several properties show
that the model is scalable with respect to the number of
organizations in the system without increasing management
complexity. Representation of trans-organizational roles us-
ing attribute certiﬁcates and identity strings were studied,
and several approaches to address this were discussed.
Future work includes extending the model to include role
hierarchies, constraints, and a consolidated model (RBAC1,
RBAC2, and RBAC3, respectively), similar to the families
of RBAC96 and ROBAC models. Also, HIBE currently has
not been extended for key revocation, anonymous authen-
tication of identity strings and support for multiple hier-
archical roles. These issues must be studied to assess the
suitability of identity strings as trans-organizational roles.
Furthermore, a mechanism must be designed to allow IdPs
to protect roles from interpretation, or assign roles which
can only be interpreted by certain SPs. This constraint
allows trans-organizational RBAC to create federations, or
to completely protect their IDs from trans-organizational
use. The ability of the model to support single organiza-
tion, federation-based, and trans-organizational use cases is
an interesting possibility for future study.
