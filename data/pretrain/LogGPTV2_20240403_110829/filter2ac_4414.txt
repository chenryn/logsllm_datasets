**Recommendations:**

1. **Remove Unnecessary Remote Services:**
   - Identify and remove remote services that are not regularly used. If certain remote services, such as vendor remote access, are only needed occasionally, enable them only when required.

2. **Configure External Remote Access Points:**
   - Ensure that all external remote access points, including jump boxes and VPN concentrators, are configured with the minimum necessary functionality.
   - Specifically, remove any unnecessary services to minimize the attack surface and enhance security.

By following these recommendations, you can reduce the risk of unauthorized access and improve the overall security posture of your systems.
