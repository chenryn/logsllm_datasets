# Numerical Analysis of Fluid Stochastic Petri Nets (FSPNs)

## Introduction
This document presents a numerical approach for the transient analysis of fluid stochastic Petri nets (FSPNs) with large state spaces. The method uses a compact, yet exact, representation of the transition matrix and an approximate representation of the solution vector to handle very large state spaces.

### Parameters and Definitions
- \( f \)
- \( \lambda = \frac{1}{128} \)
- \( tf1(1) = mp1,1 \)
- \( tf1(j) = 1 \) for \( j = 2, 3 \)
- \( \lambda_{tf2} = \frac{1}{96} \)
- \( tf2(1) = mp1,1 \)
- \( tf2(2) = x1 + 1 \)
- \( tf2(3) = 1 \)

### Figures
- **Figure 7**: Probability of normal operation of the system.
- **Figure 8**: Process degradation.

## Discussion
The example presented has two fluid places but differs significantly from a simple running example due to flush-out arcs and state-dependent flow and firing rates. The reachable states space is a proper subset of the potential state space, requiring a hierarchical structure.

We analyze two configurations:
- \( K1 = K4 = 3 \)
- \( K1 = K4 = 5 \)

Results for the mean probability of normal operation and process degradation are shown in Figures 7 and 8. The HTD structure remains compact, allowing faster computation of vector-matrix products compared to flat or sparse matrix implementations, especially for large state spaces.

## Conclusion
The paper introduces a compositional class of FSPNs and a new numerical approach for their transient analysis. This approach is designed to handle very large state spaces by using compact representations of the transition matrix and solution vector. Future work includes extending the model to second-order fluid models and integrating unbounded fluid places.
