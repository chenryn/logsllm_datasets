React version: 18.0.0
In 18.0.0, StrictMode causes a `useEffect` with an empty deps array to execute
twice when a component mounts. This did not happen in 17.0.2.
## Steps To Reproduce
Add a `useEffect` with an empty deps array, e.g
    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("test")
    }, [])
And ensure StrictMode is enabled:
      ,
Link to code example:
React 17.0.2: https://codesandbox.io/s/youthful-smoke-z3nxmv  
React 18.0.0: https://codesandbox.io/s/nervous-tess-7qsm1r
Observe that in the 18.0.0 version, the `console.log` and `fetch` statements
are executed twice.
## The current behavior
`useEffect` with empty deps array is executed twice.
## The expected behavior
17.0.2 behaviour is preserved, the `useEffect` is only fired once.
Is this an expected change with 18.0.0? One common use case for `useEffect` is
to make a web request - these web requests are now being fired twice when in
StrictMode. In the code examples, I am making such a request and both can be
seen in the network tab in devtools.
To be clear, its not a major issue for me at the moment, but its plausible
that the duplicated `useEffect` call could result in differing behaviour for a
component in development with StrictMode vs in production, depending on what
the `useEffect` is doing.
