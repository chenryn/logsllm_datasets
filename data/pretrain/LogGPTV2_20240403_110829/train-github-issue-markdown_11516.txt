I was inquiring about whether there is already schema support available for `SimpleUrlHandlerMapping`. Before I attempted to implement it myself, I conducted a search and came across the Fisheye site at this URL:  
http://fisheye1.cenqua.com/browse/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/web/servlet/config

What I discovered was intriguing; the "extensible XML authoring" for this handler mapping type appeared to be already in place. (I thought to myself - great!)

However, I am unable to locate these files and schemas in the final 2.0 release. Could you please clarify if I am missing something, or were these components not included in the release, or will they not be released at all?

Thank you,  
Harold Neiper
