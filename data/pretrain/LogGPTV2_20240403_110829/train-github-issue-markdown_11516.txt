I was wondering if there was already schema support for
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping so started searching before I did it myself. Anyhow
came across the fisheye site at this url:  
http://fisheye1.cenqua.com/browse/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/web/servlet/config
And what I found interested me in that the "extensible xml authoring" was
already there for this handler mapping type. (Thinking to myself - sweet!)
However, I am unable to find these files and schemas in the final release of
2.0. Am I missing something or were they just not released or wont be
released?
Thanks, Harold Neiper
