User: I have a huge MILP in Matlab, which I want to re-program in Gurobi using python language, on a Windows desktop. But after that I want to run it on a super computer which has a Linux os. I know python is cross-platform. Does this mean anything I create in Gurobi on Windows will run on Linux too? If this question is dumb I'm sorry, I just want to know for sure.
Assistant: Yes, you can write Gurobi Python code on one system, then copy it and run it on another. You can go from Windows to Linux, Mac to Windows, etc.  Alternately, if you have Gurobi Compute Server, your Windows computer can be a client of your Linux server.
