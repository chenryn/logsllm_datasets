User: How to use Git for code version management and collaborative development?
Assistant: Git is a commonly used code version management tool that can be used to collaboratively develop and manage code changes. The following is the process of using Git for code version management and collaborative development: 1. Install Git: Install Git on the local computer so that you can use the Git command line tool for code version management and collaborative development. 2. Create a Git warehouse: Create a Git warehouse on the local computer to store relevant content such as code and version information locally. 3. Add files to Git repository: Add code files to Git repository and use Git command line tools for management and version control. 4. Submit code changes: After making code changes, submit the code changes to the warehouse through the Git command line tool, and record the description of the relevant changes. 5. Branch management: Create branches through the Git command line tool and manage the code of different branches, so that multiple people can develop collaboratively. 6. Git remote warehouse: Git remote warehouse can be used for code sharing and collaborative development. You can push the local Git warehouse to the remote warehouse, and pull the code of the remote warehouse for local management. 7. Merge code: In the collaborative development process, branches are merged through the Git command line tool so that different branches can collaborate with each other. All in all, using Git for code version management and collaborative development can help teams work together, improve code quality and efficiency, and more.
