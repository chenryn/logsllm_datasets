CHAPTER 6. A MODEL OF APPSTORE WORKLOADS
Figure 6.5: Comparison of di(cid:11)erent models distances from measured data.
APP-CLUSTERING model has the smallest distance from measured data. The
distance of each model from the measured data shows that APP-CLUSTERING
is able to approximate the actual downloads up to 7.2 times closer than ZIPF and
up to 6.4 times closer than ZIPF-at-most-once.
6.5 Summary
To summarize, in this chapter we present a novel model of appstore work-
loads based on fetch-at-most-once property and our suggested clustering
e(cid:11)ect. We describe our APP-CLUSTERING model and we discuss its key
parameters. Then, we validate our model through a series of simulations
attempting to approximate the actual distribution of app downloads in the
appstores of our dataset. Our (cid:12)ndings show that the combination of fetch-at-
most-once behavior with the clustering e(cid:11)ect can approximate more closely
the actual data, which implies that this combination is the reason why ag-
gregate popularity of apps deviate substantially from Zipf behavior that has
been observed in the Web [31]. Moreover, we believe that such a model will
be helpful for appstore owners to estimate the app popularity (downloads
distributions) of their hosted apps, as well as will help them to pinpoint
\problematic" applications, e.g. those that do not seem to attract the inter-
est of the users, and either help them through recommendations to have a
chance of gaining popularity (downloads) or remove them completely from
their marketplace.

In this chapter we present a detailed study of the role of pricing in smart-
phone applications. For this purpose, we are using data collected from
SlideMe marketplace (the only one of our monitored appstores that con-
tains paid apps), and we are focusing on several aspects such as: the income
of paid apps, how this income is distributed across di(cid:11)erent app categories
and across developers, which are developers’ trends: Do they target at a
limited number of app categories (user audiences)? Do They appear to care
about the quality or the quantity of their products? Furthermore, we try to
answer the question: Can free apps make higher income than paid apps? To
do so, we estimate the average income that a free app should produce from
other means such as through ads (advertisements) or in-app-billing, so that
to earn the same amount of money as the average income of a paid app.
7.1 The Developers
At (cid:12)rst, we present the total number of developers that produce apps in
SlideMe appstore and how they are distributed across paid and free apps.
In Table 7.1, we can see that there are 5,106 developers in total, which
is equal to one (cid:12)fth of the number of available apps in the marketplace.
We also observe that the majority of the developers (87,3%) produce free
apps, while a small fraction (about 25.7%) of them deal with free apps.
Notice that these percentages sum up to a higher value than 100%, as there
are developers that produce both paid and no-cost apps. These developers
account for 13% of the total number (about 664) of developers. Besides,

there is an equivalent proportion of developers (14.5%) dealing entirely with
paid applications development.
Next, we are interested in (cid:12)nding how many apps are made by each
developer. Figure 7.1 shows the CDF of the number of free and paid apps
produced by developers of SlideMe appstore. Note that cumulative fraction
of free apps has been calculated based on the set of developers that produced
free apps, and not on the entire number of developers in the marketplace.
Similarly, we computed the CDF of paid apps per developer. We can see
that most of developers have produced only a single app. Particularly, al-
most 60% of developers that focus on free apps and about 70% of developers
that focus on paid apps have only one application hosted in the marketplace.
Moreover, developers that have made from 2 to 10 apps correspond to the
second largest percentage, which is 35% for the free app developers and
about 27% for the paid app developers. The small upper fraction in the

graph, that is 4% of free app developers and 2% of paid app developers have
created a number of apps ranges from 11 to 50 and 16 to 36 respectively. Sur-
prisingly, we see that 1% of free app developers account for 592 apps, while
the same portion for paid app developers have made 1402 apps. By analysing
our data we found that these two cases correspond to two di(cid:11)erent compa-
nies. Speci(cid:12)cally, the 1402 paid apps were E-books applications that belong
to SmartEbook.com 1 company (formerly known as For-side.com). SmartE-
book.com is a Japanese mobile content provider company with operations
primarily in Asia and North America, focusing on providing E-books world-
wide. Furthermore, the 592 free apps belong to Tristit 2, an independent
global mobile applications developer company with over 12,000 app titles in
stock.
Having a vision of the number of apps per developer, it would be inter-
esting to see what is the portion of the free and paid apps made across the
whole population of app developers in SlideMe appstore. Figure 7.2 shows
the CDF of percentage of free and paid apps made by developers. Note that
the two distributions in the graph are symmetric to each other. We observe
that only 12% of developers (upper 12% in the graph) produce only paid

have made both free and paid apps. Those who have evenly spread rates
of free and paid apps constitute about 7% of all developers. This leads to
the conclusion that developers seem to have a common strategy, and clearly
prefer to o(cid:11)er either only free or only paid apps (mainly free).
To understand the strategies followed by developers in the marketplaces
we would like to see whether they focus on one or more categories. Figure 7.3
shows the CDF of unique categories of the apps made per developer. we can
see that one fourth (75%) of developers focus on one category and 90% of
them focus on one or two categories. Due to the fact that most developers
of our dataset (SlideMe data) have made only one application, it is obvious
to see most of them to focus on one category too. To get a more clear view
(a) All
(b) Free vs paid
Figure 7.3: CDF of app categories per developer in SlideMe appstore.
of developers’ preferences for app categories, we replot the CDF graph in
Figure 7.4, only for developers that made at least two apps. The results are
very similar with the previous plot. We can see that the 77% of developers
prefer to focus on one or two unique categories.This conclusion appears
stronger for the developers of the paid apps, as 75% of them have made
apps belonging to one single category and 80% of them aim only to one or
two categories.
In addition, we were curious about how the amount of developers is
distributed among di(cid:11)erent categories of applications in SlideMe appstore.
Figure 7.5 displays the total number of developers per app category, as well
as the number of developers associated with free and paid apps separately.
The relative number of these 3 sets of developers seem to be the same for
each category. We see that the top app categories in terms of number of
developers are games (at the highest position), followed by utilities and
entertainment, with an almost similar developers’ crowd, and then follow
other categories like educational, productivity, lifestyle, communications etc.
Overall, we observe that almost half of the developers focus on a single
category (games). Moreover, the majority of them (about 85%) make apps
for only 3 out of 20 categories (games, utilities and educational).

7.2 Income per Developer
In this section, we focus our interest on the income that is gained by devel-
opers in SlideMe marketplace. To compute the income for each developer we
relied on the total number of downloads (purchases) of all the paid applica-
tions during the measurements’ period, as well as on their price. Figure 7.6
depicts the total income per developer along with the average income per
developer per app. The two plots don’t seem to have signi(cid:12)cant di(cid:11)erences,
as the number of apps of each developer is relatively small, as shown in the
previous section. For this reason we will focus to the graph of Figure 7.6(a).

According to the graph, 32% of the developers have not earned any income.
In general, almost 60% of developers have gained from 0 to 12 dollars. Then
there is a portion of developers, about 25% of them (from 60% to 85% in
the graph), that have income ranges from 12 to 150 dollars, and a smaller
portion, approximately 10% of them (from 85% to 95% in the graph) earned
income between 150 and 1,500 dollars. The next 4% of developers have made
funds from 1,500 to 11,260 dollars, where 1% of the total number of devel-
opers (upper 1% in the graph), have gained up to 2,400,000 dollars! This
tremendous amount of income apparently come from creators of the most
