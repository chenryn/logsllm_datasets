User: I haven't been able to find any solid information online.
I'm curious to know if its possible (and how) to use the Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service with Tornado. 
If it isn't, whats the best alternative to using AWS as a scalable option with Tornado?
Assistant: It is possible.
For example our setup is ELB->nginx->tornado.
nginx is used for app specific proxy, cache and header magic, but can be thrown out of this chain or replaced with something else.
