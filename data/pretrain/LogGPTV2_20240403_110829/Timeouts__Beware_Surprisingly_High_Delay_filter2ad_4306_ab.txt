of an echo request to the same address are matched into a
single record and given a round-trip measurement precise to
microseconds. Should an echo response take four seconds
to arrive, a “timeout” record is recorded associated with the
probe, and an “unmatched” record is recorded associated
with the response. These two packets have timestamps pre-
cise only to seconds. The dataset also includes ICMP error
responses (e.g., “host unreachable”); we ignore all probes as-
sociated with such responses since the latency of ICMP error
responses is not relevant.
In later sections, we will complement this dataset with
results from Zmap [5] and additional experiments includ-
ing more frequent probing with Scamper [13] and Scrip-
troute [22].
3.2 Matched response latencies are capped at
the timeout
In this section, we present the latencies we would observe
when considering only those responses that were matched to

matched response from a source address that is within the
same /24 address block, but diﬀerent from the destination.
In each round of probing, this behavior repeats. Here, we
analyze these unmatched responses, ﬁnd that they are likely
caused by probing broadcast addresses, and ﬁlter them.
Network preﬁxes often include a broadcast address, where
one address within a subnet represents all devices connected
to that preﬁx [16]. The broadcast address in a network
should be an address that is unlikely to be assigned to a real
host [16], such as the address whose host-part bits are all 1s
or 0s, allowing us to characterize broadcast addresses. De-
vices that receive an echo request sent to the broadcast ad-
dress may, depending on conﬁguration, send a response [3],
and if sending a response, will use a source address that is
their own. We call these responses broadcast responses. No
device should send an echo response with the source address
that is the broadcast destination of the echo request.
We hypothesize that pings that trigger responses from dif-
ferent addresses within the same /24 address block result
when the ping destination is a broadcast address. We exam-
ine ping destinations that solicit a response from a diﬀerent
address in the same /24 address block, and check if they
appear to be broadcast addresses.
We extended the ICMP probing module in the Zmap scan-
ner [5] to embed the destination into the echo request, then
to extract the destination from the echo response. Doing so
allows us to infer the destination address to which the probe
was originally sent. Zmap collected the data and made it
available for download at scans.io.
We choose the Zmap scan conducted closest in time to the
last ISI survey we studied, on April 17 2015, to investigate
the host-part bits of destination addresses that triggered re-
sponses from a diﬀerent address from the same /24 address
block. We plot the distribution of the last octets of these
addresses in Figure 2. Last octets with the last N bits end-
ing in 1 or 0, where N is greater than 1, such as 255, 0, 127,
128 etc., have spikes. These addresses are likely broadcast
addresses. On the other hand, last octets that end in binary
’01’ or ’10’ have very few addresses.
Broadcast responses exist in the dataset
We examine if unmatched responses in the ISI dataset are
caused by pings sent to broadcast addresses. Since broadcast
responses are likely to be seen after an Echo Request sent
to a broadcast address, we ﬁnd the most recently probed
Figure 3: Number of unmatched responses that followed a
probe sent to address with last octet X. Last octets with last
N bits ending in 0s and 1s (where N > 1) observe spikes,
likely caused by broadcast responses. Not all unmatched
responses are caused by broadcast responses, however, since
there exist roughly 10M unmatched responses distributed
evenly across all last octets.
address within the same /24 preﬁx for each unmatched re-
sponse. We then extract the last octet of the most recently
probed address. Figure 3 shows the distribution of un-
matched responses across these last octets. We ﬁnd that
around 10M unmatched responses are distributed evenly
across all last octets: these are unmatched responses that
don’t seem to be broadcast responses. However, last octets
that have their last N bits as 1s and 0s ,when N is greater
than 1, observe spikes similar to those in Figure 2.
If left in the data, broadcast responses could yield sub-
stantial latency overestimates in the following, common, sce-
nario, which we illustrate in Figure 4. Assume that the echo
request sent to an address 211.4.10.254 is lost and that the
device is conﬁgured to respond to broadcast pings. The echo
request sent to 211.4.10.254 could then be matched to the
response to the request sent to 211.4.10.255, the broadcast
address of the enclosing preﬁx. This would lead to a la-
tency based on the interval between probing 211.4.10.254
and 211.4.10.255, as shown in the ﬁgure.
Filtering broadcast responses
We develop a method which uses ISI’s non-random probing
scheme to detect addresses that source broadcast responses.
We call such addresses broadcast responders, and seek to
ﬁlter all their responses. We believe that delayed responses
are likely to exhibit high variance in their response latencies,
since congestion varies over time. On the other hand, a
broadcast response is likely to have relatively stable latency.
ISI’s probing scheme sends probes to each address in a
/24 address block in a nonrandom sequence, allowing us
to develop a ﬁlter that checks if a source address responds
to a broadcast address each round. Addresses are probed
such that last octets that are oﬀ by one, such as 254 and
255, receive pings spaced 330 seconds apart (half the prob-
ing interval of 11 minutes) as shown in Figure 4. For ev-
ery unmatched response with a latency of at least 10 sec-
onds, the ﬁlter checks if the same source address had sent an
unmatched response with a similar latency in the previous
round. We take an exponentially weighted moving average
of the number of times this occurs for a given source address

gle echo request, for IP addresses that sent more than 2
responses to an echo request. The red dots indicate in-
stances where addresses responded to a single echo request
with more than 1M echo responses. We believe that these
are caused by DoS attacks.
3.3.2 Duplicate responses
Packets can be duplicated. A duplicated packet will not
aﬀect inferred latencies as long as the original response to the
original probe packet reaches the prober, since our scheme
ignores subsequent duplicate responses. However, we ﬁnd
that some IP addresses respond many times to a single
probe. In this case, the incoming packets aren’t responses
to probes, but are either caused by incorrect conﬁgurations
or malicious behavior.
Figure 5 shows the distribution of the maximum number
of echo responses observed in response to a single echo re-
quest. Since broadcast responses can also be interpreted as
duplicate responses, we look only at IP addresses that sent
more than 2 echo responses for an echo request. Of 658,841
such addresses, we ﬁnd that 4,985 (0.7%) sent at least 1,000
echo responses. The red dots in the ﬁgure show 26 addresses
that sent more than one million echo responses, with one ad-
dress sending nearly 11 million responses in 11 minutes.
Zmap authors reported that they observed retaliatory DoS
attacks in response to their Internet-wide probes [5]. We
believe that some of the responses in the ISI dataset are
also caused by DoS attacks.
We ﬁlter duplicate responses by ignoring IP addresses that
ever responded more than 4 times to a single echo request,
based on observing the distribution of duplicates shown in
Figure 5. Packets can sometimes get duplicated on the In-
ternet, and we want to be selective in our ﬁltering to remove
as little as necessary. Even if a response from the probed IP
address is duplicated and a broadcast response is also dupli-
cated, there should be only 4 echo responses in the dataset.
We believe that IP addresses observing more than 4 echo
responses to a single echo request are either misconﬁgured
or are participating in a DoS attack.
In either case, the
latencies are not trustworthy.
4. RECOMMENDED TIMEOUT VALUES
In this section, we analyze the ping latencies of all pings
obtained from ISI’s Internet survey datasets from 2015 to
ﬁnd reasonable timeout values. We demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our matching scheme for recovering delayed
Figure 4: We ﬁlter broadcast responses since they can lead
to the inference of false latencies. This ﬁgure illustrates a
potential incorrect match caused by a broadcast response.
Echo requests sent to the broadcast address 211.4.10.255
at T = 330 and T = 990 seconds solicit responses from
211.4.10.254. When a timeout occurs for a request sent di-
rectly to 211.4.10.254 at T = 660 seconds, we would falsely
connect that request to the response at T = 990 seconds.
with α = 0.01. Most broadcast responders have the maxi-
mum of this moving average > 0.9, but since probe-loss can
potentially decrease this value, we mark IP addresses with
values > 0.2 and ﬁlter all their responses.
We conﬁrm that we ﬁnd broadcast responders correctly
in the ISI surveys by comparing the ones we found in the
ISI 2015 surveys with broadcast responders from the Zmap
dataset. Zmap detected 939,559 broadcast responders in
the April 17 2015 scan, of which 7212 had been addresses
that provided Echo Responses in ISI’s IT63w (20150117)
and IT63c (20150206) datasets. The ﬁlter detected 7044
(97.7%) of these as broadcast responders. We inspected the
168 remaining addresses and found that 154 addresses have
99th percentile latencies below 2.5 seconds. Since ISI probes
a /24 preﬁx only once every 2.5 seconds, these addresses
cannot be broadcast responders. Another 5 addresses have
99th percentiles latencies below 5 seconds; these are unlikely
to be broadcast responders as well.
The remaining 9 addresses had 99th percentile latencies in
excess of 300s and seem to be broadcast responders. Upon
closer inspection, we found that these addresses only occa-
sionally sent an unmatched response: around once every 50
rounds. The α parameter of the ﬁlter can tolerate some
rounds with missing responses, but these addresses respond
in so few rounds that they pass undetected. If these 9 are
indeed broadcast responders as suggested by high 99th per-
centile latencies, this yields a false negative rate of our ﬁlter
of 0.13%.

responses from the dataset. We then group the survey-
detected responses and delayed responses together to de-
termine what timeout values would be necessary to recover
various percentiles of responses. Some IP addresses observe
very high latencies in the ISI dataset; we verify that these
are real in Section 5 and examine causes in Section 6.
4.1 Incorporating unmatched responses
ISI detected 9.64 Billion echo responses from 4 Million
IP addresses in 2015 in the IT63w (20150117) and IT63c
(20150206) datasets, as shown in the ﬁrst row of Table 1.
The next row shows the number of responses we would have
obtained if we had used a naive matching scheme where
we simply matched each unmatched response for an IP ad-
dress with the last echo request for that IP address, without
ﬁltering unexpected responses. The number of responses
increases by 1.3% to 9.77 Billion; however, this includes re-
sponses from addresses that received broadcast responses
and duplicate responses. After ﬁltering unexpected responses,
the number of IP addresses reduces to 99.23% of the original
addresses. Of 30,678 discarded IP addresses, 9,942 (32.4%)
addresses were discarded because they also received broad-
cast responses. The majority of discarded IP addresses,
20,736 (67.6%) were addresses that sent more than 4 echo
responses in response to a single echo request.
Though the number of discarded IP addresses is rela-
tively small, removing them eliminates responses that clus-
ter around 330, 165, and 495 seconds. Figure 6 shows the
distribution of percentile latency per IP address before and
after ﬁltering unexpected responses. Comparing these two
graphs shows that the “bumps” in the CDF are removed by
the ﬁltering.
After discarding addresses, our matching technique yields
23,074,173 additional responses for the remaining addresses,
giving us a total of 9.67 Billion Echo Responses from 3.98
Million IP addresses. We perform our latency analysis on
this combined dataset.
4.2 Recommended Timeout Values
We now ﬁnd retransmission thresholds which recover var-
ious percentiles of responses for the IP addresses from the
combined dataset. For each IP address, we ﬁnd the 1st,
50th, 80th, 90th, 95th, 98th and 99th percentile latencies.
We then ﬁnd the 1st, 50th, 80th, 90th, 95th, 98th and 99th
percentiles of all the 1st percentile latencies. We repeat this
for each percentile and show the results in Table 2.
The 1st percentile of an address’s latency will be close to
the ideal latency that its link can provide. We ﬁnd that
the 1st percentile latency is below 330ms for 99% of IP ad-
dresses: most addresses are capable of responding with low
latency. Further, 50% of pings from 50% of the addresses
have latencies below 190ms, showing that latencies tend to
be low in general.
