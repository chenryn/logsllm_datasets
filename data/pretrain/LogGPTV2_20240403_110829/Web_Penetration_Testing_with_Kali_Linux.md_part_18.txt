Using Kali in Forensic mode helps you achieve your number one golden rule of not
modifying the original filesystem. The internal hard drive is not touched and there
is no automount of internal disks. Swap partitions and any other memory or caching
partitions are also not used in any way.
In forensics mode, removable media will not be automounted. If a CD or a thumb
drive is inserted into the system, nothing will happen. It is possible you may want
to use removable media in forensics mode by manually mounting it. This gives
the forensics specialist complete control of the filesystem and media that is being
mounted on the system.
As previously stated, you should always work on a copy of the data source. It is
important to keep the filesystem of the copy intact so you can show you did not
modify it as well as that your steps can be recreated. Let's look at how to use tools
available in Kali to copy and hash data.
Filesystem analysis with Kali
dd is one of the most common Linux/Unix tools used to copy filesystems. The
tool can be used to make an exact copy of a filesystem, including deleted and boot
sectors. In many cases, the tool is used to create a disk image file of external media
or hard drives. When dd creates a disk image, it can be mounted and examined on
other systems. dd can save the disk image on a network share if needed or a USB
drive so forensic analysts do not touch the local filesystem. The next example will
examine how to use dd to make a copy of an internal hard drive. The first step is
selecting a target machine and boot up with the Kali Live CD in forensics mode.
We will run the command sfdisk -l to view the disk information on the system
we are performing analysis on.

The previous screenshot shows five partitions. Partitions 1, 2, and 5 seem to be
the most interesting since partition 3 and 4 are listed as empty. Remember, swap
partitions can contain information left over from user activities and cache. If we had
booted the Live CD on a Windows-based system, we would see a different partition
structure; however, the overall concept would be the same.
The next step is deciding which partition to copy. Let's select the first partition listed
in the previous image as /dev/sda1.
The basic usage of the dd command is as follows:
dd if= of=
For this example, we will type the following command to make a copy of the first
partition:
dd if=/dev/sda1 of=sda1-image.dd
This will create an image file that is an exact copy of our sda1 partition to our local
filesystem. Hopefully you see a major issue with what we did. We just broke one of
our golden rules of not modifying the original data when we wrote the file to our
local filesystem, which is considered modifying the data. Best practice is writing the
image file to another filesystem, such as a different partition, network share, or a
USB drive. The author's personal preference is using a USB drive; however, for this
example, using the local filesystem is acceptable for testing purposes only.
To use a USB drive for the storage of the copied system, you will first need to plug
a large USB drive into your system. Since you are in forensics mode on the Live
CD, Kali will not mount the USB drive. Typically, you want to leave the filesystem
unmounted and let the dd tool handle the drive specifics. To do this, run the
command shown in the following screenshot:
The USB device location was /dev/null/; however, you can chose any location.
You can also save the image directly to a NFS network share. You do so by using
the following command:
dd if=/dev/sda1 | nc my_ip_address_to_network_server optional port
In the following example, we are cloning the partition sda1 to our NFS storage
server with an IP address of 10.0.0.5:
dd if=/dev/sda1 | nc 10.0.0.5

Chapter 7
There are other tools that are available to clone a filesystem. We recommend the
dd tool for cloning specific partitions, because it is built into Kali and most other
Linux and Unix systems. The process to clone a system can be very time consuming,
depending on how large the partition is that you are trying to copy. Although dd
is a great tool, it may not always be the best the tool. If you are looking to cloning
an entire disk, there are other popular tools, such as AIMAGE or AIR Imager, that
do not come preloaded with Kali, but are very popular. It is important to confirm
tools used in a forensic investigation adhere to standard evidence admissibility
regulations if there is a possibility the research will be used in a legal matter.
dc3dd
dc3dd is the dd tool with added functionality for forensics. dc3dd can calculate a
hash between the drive you are copying and the source drive on a bit-by-bit level.
This is critical when proving the copy of data you are working is exactly like the
original. This can be accomplished by creating a hash of the original and the copy
to later verify a match.
For the next example, we will run the sfdisk -l command to see the drives and
partitions available, as shown in the following screenshot:
The dc3dd command is executed in a similar way as the dd tool. You pick a source
drive or partition as well as the destination to save the image. There is also a hash
option. In the next example, we take the partition of /dev/sda2 and copy it to an
image file named CopyofDrivedc3dd, along with calculating a hash using sha256.

This example is for demonstration purposes. A real forensic
investigation would not save the image back to the same drive.
dc3dd will give you a unique hash code for the input file of the copied drive when
it is complete.
It is important to prove the hash of the copy matches exactly with the original. We can
use the command sha256sum to calculate the hash. If we calculate the hash on our file
CopyofDrivedc3dd as well as our hard drive /dev/sda2, we will see they match. We
can even see the output from our dc3dd copy is also the same. Since the hash matches,
we have confirmed the files are exactly the same for a forensic investigation.

Other forensics tools in Kali
Kali has numerous forensics tools built in under the category labeled Forensics.
Here are some commonly used tools in Kali, as applied to web application forensics:
chkrootkit
chkrootkit can be run on Linux systems to determine if rootkits exist on the
system, based on signatures and processes. Think of it as antivirus or
antimalware for Linux systems.
To run chkrootkit, open a Terminal window and type chkrootkit. This will check
the local operating system for any installed rootkits.
Chkrootkit is a simple program that can ensure your copy of Kali has not been
infected. You can also run chkrootkit on other Linux distributions by installing
it on those systems.
Autopsy
Autopsy is an open source digital forensic tool that runs on Windows, Linux, OS X,
and other Unix systems. Autopsy can be used to analyze disk images and perform
a in-depth analysis of filesystems such as NTFS, FAT, HFS+, Ext3, UFS, and several
volume system types. The most common use of Autopsy is as a case management
tool for managing analysis of image files. Remember how we created an image file
using the dd tool? Autopsy will help us investigate the image.
To run Autopsy, navigate to Kali Linux | Forensics | Digital Forensics and select
Autopsy. This will bring up a Terminal window, which will start the application.
Leave that window open and use the tool through its web interface. To access the web
interface, open up a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:9000/autopsy.

Select New Case to create a new case. This will give you the following
example screenshot:
Autopsy will prompt a few questions before continuing. Questions include setting
the time zone, entering time offsets between your Kali system and the system you
are investigating, and descriptions, such as hostnames.
The next example will use Autopsy to examine an image file that was created in
a previous example with the dd tool, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
The first step is loading an image Autopsy such as mytestimage.dd.
You will be given the option to set a hash value for your file when using the dd tool.
You can have Autopsy calculate the hash value. The authors recommend calculating
your own md5 checksum. This can be done by using the md5sum command on a file.
[ 273 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Defensive Countermeasures
You can take the value that is calculated and put it directly into Autopsy.
Autopsy is a platform that can help collect forensics information for documentation
purposes. When a partition is ready to be examined, you can use Autopsy to look
at specific disk, file information, raw files, and their metadata. Autopsy can also
connect to the National Institute of Standards Software Reference Library to compare
hashes of known files to determine if they are good or bad programs.
Binwalk
It is often challenging to determine the purpose of binary files identified during
a forensic investigation. The reason is the source code for binary files is usually
not available. Binwalk is a firmware analysis tool designed to assist in the analysis,
extraction, and reverse engineering of firmware images and other binary software.
The focus of Binwalk is firmware binary files; however, there are updates found
for home networking and wireless equipment, as well as other consumer
electronic gadgets.
Binwalk has a few different options that can be found at: https://code.google.
com/p/binwalk/wiki/Usage. You can run the command binwalk with the filename
of the binary file you would like to examine. The next example uses binwalk on a
binary firmware for a home wireless router as shown in the following screenshot:
Binwalk will output results of the binary file:

Chapter 7
The preceding screenshot shows the administrator downloaded a binary file and
renamed it to make it appear like it was coming from a different vendor (FW_WRT54G
is a Linksys router). Binwalk was able to analyze the file and alert that the file is a
Sercom firmware file, even though the file was renamed to the Linksys format.
pdf-parser
pdf-parser is used to parse and analyze Portable Document Format (PDF)
documents, as well as extract raw information such as code, images, and other
elements from PDF documents. It is a tool used to examine and deconstruct PDF
documents that are identified as possibly having malicious code.
Foremost
Foremost is a data carving utility used to recover files based on their headers,
footers, and internal data structures. Foremost works with image files, such as those
generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, or directly on a drive. The image file headers and
footers can be specified by a configuration file or using command line to identify file
types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format, allowing
for a more reliable and faster recovery.
Pasco
Pasco is a forensic tool for reading the index.dat files that are created by Microsoft
Internet Explorer. The Internet Explorer index.dat files store the user's browser
history, which can be useful for an investigation of a host. Microsoft stores the
index.dat file in various locations on the host system's hard drive. For example,
some index.dat files are in the user's home folder used for the user profile.
Pasco only works for Internet Explorer. Other browsers like Firefox and
Chrome do not leave index.dat files.
Firefox and Chrome store browser information in SQLite databases.
The location of the database varies from operating system to operating
system, but they can be opened with any SQLite viewer. One of the
author's favorite tools for SQLite clients is a Firefox plugin named
SQLite Manager.

Scalpel
Scalpel is a file carving utility that searches a database of known file header and
footer signatures, and attempts to carve files from a disk image. This is done by
configuring the scalpel.conf file with the file type(s) you would like to locate
prior to launching it against a database.
bulk_extractor
bulk_extractor can extract a variety of things from an image, including credit card
numbers, phone numbers, URLs, and emails. bulk_extractor can also generate
wordlists from an image that could be used in dictionary attacks. bulk_extractor
can take several hours to run, but the data that is extracted is well worth the wait
for use in forensics.
Summary
It is critical that security is considered during the entire lifecycle of any resources
that are important to business operations. Our goal for writing this book beyond
supporting a Penetration Tester is educating readers on various methods; malicious
users can compromise a resource, so administrators can improve their security
defenses. Everybody is a target, and it is up to the asset owner to invest the proper
time and resources into reducing the risk of being compromised.
This chapter serves as a means to defend against attacks presented in previous
chapters. It should be assumed that tools used in previous chapters could be
leveraged to verify vulnerabilities on your own systems. Topics covered in this
chapter included how to clone a web application to avoid testing live systems,
baseline security standards, and defending against topics from previous chapters.
Those topics include passwords, man-in-the-middle attacks, SSL striping, DoS,
stealing cookies, and clickjacking. This chapter also included a dedicated section
on using Kali Linux for forensic investigations.
The next chapter will cover best practices for delivering Penetration Testing
services, including methods for developing professional customer deliverables.

Penetration Test
Executive Report
Before we get started, we want to point out this chapter touches on subjects of
writing reports, clauses, and agreements. These examples should be used as general
guidelines. In no way are we advocating having knowledge or techniques that could
be accepted in a legal manner. Despite seven of our Facebook profiles being lawyers,
and being fans of Boston Legal, we are no Denny Crane. We recommend when you
get serious about developing scopes, agreements, and reports, you seek professional
legal help.
Network engineers install networks, programmers create applications, and auditors
write. As a network Penetration Tester, you are by default an auditor. Unlike a
network engineer who will configure routing protocols, or a programmer who will
create an application, your value will be based on your writing. In other words, learn
how to write. There is a science and art associated with writing. If you are trying to
find a consistent style, the authors of this book recommend The Modern Language
Association of America Style, or better known as MLA. MLA is an easy to use
writing style, used by most high schools as a writing standard. H. Ramsey Fowler
and Jane E. Aaron reference guide, titled The Little, Brown Handbook, is an excellent
reference guide on how to properly use MLA styles when writing. As a Penetration
Tester, and ultimately as an auditor, the value you provide will be judged on how
your findings are presented. The number one reason Penetration Test reports fail
is bad grammar or spelling. The number two reason is illogical flow or styles. That
is why we highly recommend having your report reviewed with individuals not
related to your project to provide an outsider perspective. This may include having
reviewers that are not technical.

Penetration Test Executive Report
How you present results will be the most influential and determining factor
for future business. Once you get familiar with a writing style, there are more
appropriate styles and flows associated with technical audits. This includes industry
standards that come from PCI and other industry specific organizations, such as
CoBIT and ITIL. Ultimately, the theme of your report will follow the accepted
standards of corporate governance for the organization you are auditing. Also keep
in mind that a penetration report will be seen by many people, and referred to for a
much longer period of time than you probably intended.
Customers want to know how vulnerable they are, and requirements to patch gaps
so that they reduce their overall security risk from attack. Formatting and tone of
a report can cause a positive or negative reaction to data. Jobs can be terminated
over being linked to a vulnerability. On contrary, a critical gap in security could be
ignored if the language from a report doesn't properly highlight how essential a fix is
needed. The best service providers can balance business and technical competencies
when developing executive reports so the final results will positively impact
leadership and technical staff.
A good starting point is looking at what regulations, standards, and mandates are
important to your customer. Mixing customer requested requirements with industry
mandates is the first topic of this chapter. Next, we will look at the different service
models used to charge for delivery services. After that, we will focus on the different
types of document formatting for executive reports so you can leave the proper
impression post service engagement. This chapter will conclude with some example
reports and cover the remaining reporting tools available in Kali Linux.
Compliance
Customers have limited budgets and typically, security is not a top spending
objective regarding proactive purchasing. In our experience, customers will spend
money on other technology areas until something bad happens causing reactive
spending. It becomes even more challenging to offer services that evaluate existing
security such as a Penetration Test when many customers have enough trouble
maintaining existing gear as well as keeping up with the latest technology. A simple
analogy is when most people purchase a laptop, they look at what software to install
for functionality rather than defense (that is, purchasing Microsoft Word rather
than an Antivirus). When that same laptop becomes infected, users stop thinking
about functional software and prioritize obtaining security software to remove the
malicious application.
[ 278 ]

Chapter 8
One method to elevate your services to the top of the purchasing priority list is
aligning with business mandates. Customers are more prone to purchase services
meeting business obligations, making the investment conversation easier to justify.
Many industry mandates have severe repercussions for failing audits that range
from fines to job termination. Aligning your deliverables with mandated regulations
is a strong option to justify procuring your services.
Terms that are important regarding industry compliance are as follows:
• Baselines: They are used to create a minimum level of security necessary to
meet policy requirements. Baselines can be configurations, architectures, or
procedures that might or might not reflect the business process, but can be
adapted to meet those requirements. You can use baselines as an abstraction
to develop standards.
• Standards: They are mandatory requirements that support higher-level
policies. A standard may require the use of a specific technology including
brand, product, and protocol. An example is creating a standard for 802.1x
using Cisco Identity Services Engine from a baseline of having to have a form
of automated access control.
• Guidelines: They are recommendations rather than required. Consider
guidelines similar to standards; however, nothing forces people to follow
them. An example is controlling which ports to open in a firewall rather than
using the allow all traffic rule.
Industry standards
There are many important industry standards that your customers are mandated to
follow. The following list is commonly used to justify procurement of funding for
products and services:
• Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): It requires
that proper controls are put in place to ensure health care transactions
and administrative information systems protect individually identifiable
electronic health information. There is a low risk of fines associated with
HIPAA non-compliance; however, significant collateral risks, such as
civil liability and brand damage could result from not meeting HIPPA
requirements.
• Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS): They are U.S. computer
security standards developed to protect information transmitted by
government agencies and contractors.
