IV. TURNING WIFI DEVICES INTO MOTION SENSORS
Our attack is driven by a new aCSI variance model that
links human motion near any anchor to temporal dynamics
of the anchor’s multipath signal propagation seen by the
attacker sniffer. Whenever an anchor transmits WiFi signals, it
unknowingly turns into a motion sensor for our attack. These
“motion signals” are immediately seen by the attacker sniffer,
who then pinpoints the targets down to their exact room(s).
Unlike prior work on passive RF sensing [63], [17], our
new model focuses on capturing temporal dynamics of multi-
path signal propagation3 from each anchor to the sniffer, rather
than only the direct path. This lets the attacker detect any
motion around each anchor that disturbs the multipath signal
propagation, and also eliminates the need to obtain precise
anchor locations and deploy multiple sniffers [63], [17].
In the following, we describe the basic observations that
motivate us to pursue the attack, the key challenges it faces,
and the key design concepts that make the attack feasible.
A. Correlation between Signal Dynamics and User Movement
(i) User movement → aCSI variance.
In an ofﬁce/home,
human users are never completely stationary. Whether it is
playing games, walking, opening doors, sitting down, their nat-
ural movements will disturb the multipath signal propagation
of nearby WiFi transmitters (i.e. anchors), creating immediate,
temporal variations in their aCSI values seen by the sniffer.
We propose to capture such temporal variation by a new
aCSI variance metric:
σaCSI =
1
|Iq| X
i∈Iq
σaCSI (fi)
(1)
where σaCSI (fi) represents the aCSI standard deviation for
subcarrier i (at frequency fi) calculated by the sniffer over
a short time window (e.g., 5s). We also take efforts to re-
duce the impact of noise and artifacts in aCSI reports by
the ﬁrmware, ﬁrst denoising aCSI per subcarrier using the
wavelet method [75], then removing outliers by only including
subcarriers whose σaCSI (·) sequences are highly correlated.
3WiFi signals sent by an anchor, when arriving at the sniffer, will go through
rich multipath propagation, e.g., reﬂections by furniture, walls and human.
The set of subcarriers used in the above calculation (Iq) are
the top 50% of most correlated pairs.
Figure 2a plots several 30-second samples of an anchor’s
σaCSI seen by the sniffer, for scenarios of no human presence,
a nearby user sitting down and standing up, opening/closing
the door, and walking. Compared to no human presence, user
movements lead to much higher σaCSI .
We also ﬁnd that user motion differs from equipment
motion commonly seen in homes and ofﬁces, e.g. an oscillating
fan and a robot vacuum. The latter either is too weak to
produce any notable impact on σaCSI or generates periodic
signal patterns different from those of human motion (§VII).
(ii) σaCSI depends on user-anchor distance. Another key
observation is that when a target is far away from an anchor
x, its movements will produce less disturbance to the signal
propagation from x to the sniffer. This is demonstrated in
Figure 2b, which compares an anchor x’s σaCSI when a human
user (walking) is close to x, far from x (in a different room),
or completely absent.
We think this is due to the fact that a target is “bigger”
when it
is closer (Figure 2c). As a target moves in the
space between an anchor x and the sniffer, it blocks and
diffracts some signal paths from x to the sniffer. When close
to x, it affects more paths than when it is far away from x.
Thus the received signals seen by the sniffer will display a
larger temporal variation when the user is closer to x. This
phenomenon can be modeled using an abstract, ray-tracing
model on σaCSI (omitted due to space limits). Given a ﬁxed
time period, user movements near x create more path dynamics
than those far from x, leading to a larger standard deviation
in the received signal strength (per subcarrier).
We validate this observation by measuring σaCSI of multi-
ple anchors (Table III) in 11 test scenes (Table II). As a target
moves in the space between an anchor and the sniffer, we see a
general tendency of σaCSI decreasing with the anchor-to-target
distance. We experiment with different wall materials (e.g.,
glass, wood), distance of anchor and sniffer (8m–15m), and
sniffer placement (e.g., on the ﬂoor, in the bush, underneath a
plastic trash can), and observe the same trend.
(iii) σaCSI is a more robust motion indicator than aCSI.
Prior work [63] localizes targets by modeling aCSI of the
direct path. This requires an accurate propagation model and

the precise physical
location of each anchor. Instead, our
σaCSI based method targets multipath dynamics caused by
user motion, thus only requires knowing the room each anchor
resides, rather than its precise location inside the room.
B. Challenge: Sensing Ambiguity
The above discussion suggests that with a sufﬁcient number
of anchors in a room, the sniffer should be able to detect human
motion in the room from its anchors’ σaCSI . For example, if
any anchor’s σaCSI is sufﬁciently large, i.e. motion detected,
the room should be marked as occupied.
But we also ﬁnd notable ambiguity in such design, caused
by two factors. First, σaCSI depends on the target-anchor
distance and the motion pattern/strength. Yet the attacker has
no knowledge of target behaviors or previous ground truth.
Second, short physical distance to an anchor does not always
translate into being the same room.
Next, we illustrate the problem of sensing ambiguity using
real-world examples, including four basic cases with a single
user and three complex cases with multiple users.
Case 1: Target staying in a room.
Figure 3a shows the
traces of σaCSI for three anchors: A and B in the left room,
and C in the right room. The target user stays inside the left
room and moves around anchor A. In this case, anchors B
and C show no sign of targets nearby (very low σaCSI ) while
anchor A has the largest σaCSI over time.
room door at t = 24s, closes it and enters the room at t = 28s.
In this case, anchor A’s σaCSI drops as the target moves away,
followed by a short, minor increase due to the opening/closing
of the right room door. Anchor C has a short, minor increase
in its σaCSI due to the door opening/closing, followed by a
signiﬁcant increase as the target moves closer. Interestingly, as
the target transitions between the two rooms, we can observe
somewhat synchronized changes on anchor A and C (since they
are triggered by the same event). But from per-anchor σaCSI
traces, a naive design will mark both rooms as occupied.
Case 3: Sniffer blocked by external pedestrian.
Pedes-
trians who move outside of the target area near the attack
sniffer could also create aCSI variations. Yet such movements
(near the common receiver) will create synchronized aCSI
variations at all the transmitting anchors, regardless of any
human presence. Again a naive design will mark both rooms
as occupied.
Case 4: External users walking around the house. When
pedestrians move away from the sniffer, the impact on σaCSI
is small even when they are close to the anchors (Figure 3d).
This is because those movements have little impact on the
multi-path propagation between the anchors (inside the two
rooms) and the sniffer.
Case 5: Multiple users moving in neighboring rooms.
Figure 4a shows an example where two targets are moving
in two different rooms, each with an anchor device. In this
case, both anchors (A and C) display large σaCSI .
Case 2: Target moving across rooms.
Following case
1, the target walks towards the room door (already open) at
t = 12s, enters hallway at t = 18s, starts to open the right
Case 6: Multiple users moving in distant rooms. A user
walks around in room A when another user sits down near an
anchor in room C (Figure 4b). We see that room A and C’s
5
anchors are triggered, but not the one in room B.

Continuous Sensing
Case 7: Anchors on both sides of a wall. Figure 4c shows
that when the user moves near anchor A, it triggers both anchor
A and B (on the other side of wall). Here the simple design
will mark both rooms as occupied (since both anchors are
triggered), creating a false positive.
C. Design Concepts
Our analysis shows that instantaneous σaCSI observed at
each individual anchor is insufﬁcient to detect and localize
user motion. We propose to overcome sensing ambiguity by
analyzing the value and pattern of σaCSI across both time and
anchors. The end result is a robust σaCSI model that links each
human motion with signal dynamics of anchors in its actual
room. Next, we outline the signal analysis process in two steps:
1) detecting human motion and 2) mapping each motion to a
room. The detailed procedures are described later in §V-A.
Detecting human motion.
If the number of detected anchors
per room is reasonable4, any user movement should “trigger”
at least one anchor in the scene. But how do we determine
threshold σp(x) necessary to trigger an anchor x? This is not
easy, because the adversarial has no ground truth on target
presence. Also the threshold should be anchor-speciﬁc and
could also vary over time.
Leveraging a common observation where a user will not
stay and move in a single room forever, we propose to derive
σp(x) by ﬁnding “outliers.” Assuming for anchor x the sniffer
can measure σaCSI (x) over a long period of time (e.g., hours
or even days), it is reasonable to assume that x is mostly not
triggered. Thus the sniffer can apply outlier detection methods
like MAD [25], [50] to derive σp(x) and adapt it over time.
Mapping Each Motion to a Room When multiple anchors
in more than one room are triggered, the sniffer needs to decide
whether they are triggered by users in one room (one source)
or users in multiple rooms (multiple sources). This is because a
target’s movement could trigger anchors in neighboring rooms
(case 7), and the same holds when multiple users move in two
rooms (case 5 and 6). The sniffer needs to distinguish between
them and determine the set of rooms that are actually occupied.
Again we leverage a common observation: human move-
ments in different rooms are generally asynchronous, thus
anchors triggered by separate sources will display different
temporal patterns in σaCSI (case 5 and 6). But when a single
source triggers anchors in neighboring rooms (case 7), these
anchors’ σaCSI will share a similar pattern. By computing the
correlation of normalized σaCSI time series across anchors, we
