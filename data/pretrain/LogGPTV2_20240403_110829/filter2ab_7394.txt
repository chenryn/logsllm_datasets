titleblackhat:eu-22 Scammers Who Scam Scammers, Hackers Who Hack Hackers: Exploring a Hidden Sub-economy on Cybercrime Forums and Marketplaces
It's no secret that criminal forums and marketplaces are crammed with nefarious activity. But behind all the initial access brokers, stolen data, and malware, there's a hidden, thriving subcategory of crime going unnoticed: threat actors targeting other threat actors. These cannibalistic criminals (we call them 'metaparasites': a parasite whose host is also a parasite) are such a persistent and expensive problem that there are specific forum rooms - containing thousands of posts and going back years - dedicated to blacklisting them, arbitrating scam complaints between users, and reporting imitation 'ripper' sites.In this talk, we present a novel investigation into scammers who scam scammers and hackers who hack hackers, on three of the most well-established and prominent criminal marketplaces. We examine the size of this shadowy multi-million-dollar ecosystem; the motivations of metaparasites; how arbitration processes work; and what influence metaparasites have on the culture and operations of the marketplaces in which they operate. We then take a deep dive into case studies, looking at the techniques metaparasites use, from old-fashioned 'rip and run' scams and fake data leaks, to sophisticated phishing campaigns, referral cons, typosquatting, and backdoored malware. Along the way, we uncover a large-scale, coordinated, and lucrative scam involving a network of 15 fake marketplaces, and instances where the threat actors got revenge, scamming the scammers who scammed them.You might ask: who cares if criminals rip each other off? But metaparasites, inadvertently, provide an intelligence boon to analysts, allowing us to gain unprecedented insights into sales, operations, negotiations, and identifiers which would otherwise remain hidden - as well as into marketplace culture, differing levels of operational security, and susceptibilities to deception and social engineering. Our talk will also help protect analysts, and the generally curious, from inadvertently falling prey to some of these scams when investigating criminal marketplaces.
