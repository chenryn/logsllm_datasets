**User:**
I would like to install my own package in my local directory (I do not have root privileges). How can I install `python3-dev` locally? I am using Ubuntu 16.04.

**Assistant:**
To install `python3-dev` locally without root privileges, you will need to build it from source. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. **Download the Python Source Code:**
   First, download the Python source code for the version you need. For example, if you want Python 3.5, which is the default version on Ubuntu 16.04, you can download it from the official Python website or use `wget`:
   ```sh
   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/Python-3.5.2.tgz
   ```

2. **Extract the Source Code:**
   Extract the downloaded tarball:
   ```sh
   tar -xzf Python-3.5.2.tgz
   cd Python-3.5.2
   ```

3. **Configure the Build:**
   Configure the build to install Python in your local directory. Replace `/path/to/local/dir` with the actual path where you want to install Python:
   ```sh
   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/local/dir
   ```

4. **Build and Install:**
   Compile the source code and install it in the specified directory:
   ```sh
   make
   make install
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   To use the locally installed Python, you need to update your environment variables. Add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.profile` file:
   ```sh
   export PATH=/path/to/local/dir/bin:$PATH
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/local/dir/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   Then, reload the configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

6. **Verify the Installation:**
   Verify that the correct Python version is being used by running:
   ```sh
   python3 --version
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to install `python3-dev` and other necessary development files locally on your system.
