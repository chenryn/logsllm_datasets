User: I have 500 files to plot and I want to do this automatically. I have the gnuplot script
that does the plotting with the file name hard coded. I would like to have a loop that calls gnuplot every iteration with a different file name, but it does not seem that gnuplot support command line arguments. 
Is there an easy way? I also installed the gnuplot-python package in case I can do it via a python script.However, I couldn't find the api so it's a bit difficult to figure out.
Thank you!
Assistant: I create a file named test.txt containing plot [0:20] x;
I run gnuplot test.txt and I see that gnuplot has indeed read contents of my file, so it does support arguments at runtime.
