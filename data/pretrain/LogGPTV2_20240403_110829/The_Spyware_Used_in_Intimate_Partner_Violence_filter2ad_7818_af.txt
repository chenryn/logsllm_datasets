APPENDIX
A. Query snowballing, seed queries, and initial ﬁltering
We use a query snowballing technique to ﬁnd a com-
prehensive set of search terms using the recommendation
APIs provided by search engines. In Figure 8, we give the
pseudocode of our snowballing approach. The algorithm takes
as input a set of seed queries and the maximum number of
queries to return. We use different seed queries for Google
and Google Play, because of the different nature of the query
recommendation APIs. While the former suggests semantically
related queries, the latter provides only query completion. The
initial seed queries for both searches are listed in Figure 9.
Both the recommendation APIs return lots of unrelated
search terms, more so in Google than in Google Play. For
example, “cheating” is expanded to a game “cheating tom”, or
“cheating husband” is expanded to “cheating husband quotes”,
none of which is what we are looking for. As we expand
the search results repeatedly, unrelated queries will drive the
snowball away from related terms. We therefore ﬁlter the
QSnowball(Qinit, (cid:2)):
Q ← φ
while |Qinit| > 0 do
q ← pop(Qinit) ; Q ← Q ∪ {q}
If |Q| ≥ (cid:2) then return Q
Y ← recommend(q)
Y (cid:2) ← ﬁlter(Y ) \ Q
Qinit ← Qinit ∪ Y (cid:2)
return Q
Fig. 8: Query snowballing approach. Here recommend represents
a query recommendation API that takes as input a query string
and returns a set of recommended queries and ﬁlter uses regular
expression heuristics to remove unrelated search phrases. The set
Qinit is an initial set of query phrases and (cid:2) is the limit of the size
on the query snowball Q.
suggested queries that contain any of the words (regular
expressions) listed in Figure 9 (right table).
B. IPS apps in iTunes App Store
During our Google search in Section III, we found several
dual-use apps enlisted on the Apple’s app store. All the off-
store apps that we found support both Android and iOS
platforms. To seek further evidence of IPS apps, we decided
to apply our measurement pipeline to the iOS platform us-
ing our crawling pipeline from Section III with only a few
modiﬁcations, as we discuss bellow.
Interestingly, unlike Play Store API, the search API pro-
vided by iTunes App Store (ofﬁcial market place for Apple,
also called App Store) does not return any search results or
query suggestions on many IPS relevant search terms such as
“catch your spouse cheating.” However, Google’s site-speciﬁc
search (searching by adding a preﬁx: “site: itunes.apple.com”
to the search term) returned several links to apps listed in
the App Store that are not found via direct search in iTunes.5
Also, we found iTunes query completion API returns a lot of
completely unrelated queries not relevant to IPS. We therefore
chose to use the snowball of search terms obtained using
Google Play store search suggestions to search iTunes and
Google for dual-use iOS apps.
Together via the direct search on iTunes and via site-speciﬁc
search in Google, we found 2,724 apps. Manual investigation
of descriptions of a random sample of 500 apps from this list
revealed that 97 apps (20%) are capable of IPS. The fraction
of on-store IPS apps we found in Apple is less than what we
saw for Android (28%). Among the on-store dual-use apps
enlisted in Google Play we found 9 IPS relevant apps listed
in iTunes App Store too (with very similar app identiﬁers).
However, many cross-listed apps have different functionalities
in iOS due to its more restricted permission model and
stricter enforcement of developer policy. For example, the
TrackView app in iOS does not hide their app icon or use the
camera surreptitiously, while in Android it does (as discussed
in Section IV-B).
5We tried similar site-speciﬁc search to ﬁnd Play Store apps too (by adding
“site: paly.google.com”), but did not ﬁnd any new app other than those we
already found via direct search in Play Store.
