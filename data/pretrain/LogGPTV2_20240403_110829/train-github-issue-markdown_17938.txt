 **Migrated issue, originally created by Michał Szczepański (@vane)**
When I'm trying to join two tables using String values that are duplicating in
each column I get less rows then expected
The query from database returns 10 rows but filtered is set to True and after
            if filtered:
                rows = util.unique_list(rows, filter_fn)
in sqlalchemy.orm.loading.py one row is left.
I think it's a problem with hashing.
                def filter_fn(row):
                    return tuple(fn(x) for x, fn in zip(row, filter_fns))
Exist with 1.0.6 and below.
Script with full example in attachment with workaround.  
Script create tables then execute bugged query and workaround query.  
You can vary result number from bugged query by changing result_rows to number
from 1 to 10
    s = Scaffold(db, result_rows=2)
Test script deletes the database file after run so it's always fresh start.
I tried it on 1.0.6 on debian and 0.9.8 on windows same results
