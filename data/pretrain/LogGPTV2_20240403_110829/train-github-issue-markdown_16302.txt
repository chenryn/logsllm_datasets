Symfony version | 4.0.0  
Hi, sorry if the question looks silly but I am stucked for hours since the 4.0
version of Symfony.  
In my `AuthController` I am trying to redirect the user to the homepage by
using `$this->redirectToRoute('home')` but I get the following error :  
`The "router" service or alias has been removed or inlined when the container
was compiled. You should either make it public, or stop using the container
directly and use dependency injection instead.`
with these details :
    Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\ServiceNotFoundException:
    The "router" service or alias has been removed or inlined when the container was compiled. You should either make it public, or stop using the container directly and use dependency injection instead.

I installed the framework extra bundle, and of course extended my class to
`Controller`.
It worked well before I upgraded to this new version.
Any ideas please ? :(
Thank you
