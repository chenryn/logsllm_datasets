Enterprise email solutions often include monitoring mechanisms that allow for the regular auditing of inbox rules. In an Exchange environment, administrators can use the following PowerShell cmdlets to discover and remove potentially malicious inbox and transport rules:

- `Get-InboxRule` and `Remove-InboxRule` to manage inbox rules.
- `Get-TransportRule` and `Remove-TransportRule` to manage transport rules.

These cmdlets provide a systematic way to ensure that no unauthorized or malicious rules are in place, thereby enhancing the security of the email system.
