User: How do I download a remote file into several chunks using twisted? Lets say if the file is 100 bytes, I want to spawn 10 connection which will read 10 bytes each but in no particular order and then later on merge them all.
I was able to do this using threads in Python but I don't have any idea how to use twisted's reactor + manager + protocol to achieve the same. Any advice as to how should I design this?
Assistant: I don't think this really provides the direction the user requires - the question seems to be clear in how to use Twisted to achieve this - the answer implies reasonable knowledge of Twisted.
