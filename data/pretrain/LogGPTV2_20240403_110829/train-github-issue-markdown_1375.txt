#### Description

When an HTML template binds a property to its component and an error occurs during change detection for this property, the entire application stops detecting changes. Adding an error handler does not resolve the issue.

In my specific case, I have two properties: `Code` and `Name`. The `Name` property is bound to an external object named `EntityPM`. When `EntityPM` is undefined, the change detector stops working for the entire application.

I expect the code to continue detecting changes from the input, even if there is an error with the `Name` property.

#### Example

Consider the following scenario:

- **Properties**: `Code`, `Name`
- **Binding**: `Name` is bound to an external object `EntityPM`.
- **Error Condition**: `EntityPM` is undefined.

When `EntityPM` is undefined, the change detection for the entire application halts, despite the presence of an error handler.

#### Expected Behavior

The application should continue to detect changes for other properties (e.g., `Code`) even if there is an error with the `Name` property.
