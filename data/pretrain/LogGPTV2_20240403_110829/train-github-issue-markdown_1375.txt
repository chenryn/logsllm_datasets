If i have an html that binds a property on its component and an error happens
while detection changes for this property, the whole application will stop
detecting changes, even if i add an error handler it wont help.\
Below i have tow properties Code,Name the Name is binding its value from an
external object named EntityPM, now when this object is undefined the change
detector will stop for the whole application.  
I expect that the code should continue detecting the changes from the input
even that there is an error with the name.
