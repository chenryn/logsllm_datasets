**Current Behavior**
When using `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, and `Validators.required`, the "required" and "ng-reflect-required" attributes are not present on the input element. 

I have been using the following CSS selector to style valid and invalid inputs:
```css
.ng-valid[required], .ng-valid.required {
    /* styles */
}
```
However, this approach seems incorrect because it requires maintaining validators in two different places.

**Expected Behavior**
When `Validators.required` is added to the `FormControl`'s synchronous validators, the `.ng-valid[required]` or `.ng-valid.required` class should be applied to the input element.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
Please see the Plunker example: http://plnkr.co/edit/dQTANsTnaFbwXXjC35gD?p=info

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
Maintaining validators in two different places (JavaScript and CSS) is not ideal. However, having such a CSS selector is useful for styling purposes.
