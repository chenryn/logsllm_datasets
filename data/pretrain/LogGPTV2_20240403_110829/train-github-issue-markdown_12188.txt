**Current behavior**  
When using FormBuilder, FormGroup, FormControl, and Validators.required, the
"required" and "ng-reflect-required" attributes are missing from the input.
After this guide:  
I use
    .ng-valid[required], .ng-valid.required  {
        ...
    }
for signing inputs that are OK or erroneous. It sounds wrong to maintain
validators in two different places.
**Expected behavior**  
When Validators.required is added to the FormControl's synchronous validators,
the .ng-valid[required] or .ng-valid.required should fire.

**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
It sounds wrong to maintain validators in two different places, but having
such a CSS selector is nice to have.
