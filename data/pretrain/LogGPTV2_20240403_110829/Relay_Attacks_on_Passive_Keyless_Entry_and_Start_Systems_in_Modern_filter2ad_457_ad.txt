car owner passes in front of this second antenna with his
key in the pocket, the key will receive the signals from the
car and will send the open command to the car. As this mes-
sage is sent over UHF it will reach the car even if the car is
within a hundred meters 11. The car will therefore unlock.
Once that the attacker has access to the car, the signals from
within the car are relayed and the key will now believe it is
inside the car and emit the allow start message. The car can
now be started and driven. When the attacker drives away
with the car, the relay will no longer be active. The car may
detect the missing key; however, for safety reasons, the car
will not stop, but continue running. Similarly, the car might
detect a missing key for several other reasons including if
the key battery is depleted. Some car models will not notify
the user if the key is not found when the car is on course,
while some will emit a warning beep. None of the evaluated
cars stopped the engine if the key was not detected after the
engine had been started.
This attack therefore enables the attackers to gain access
(open) and to get authorization to drive (start and drive) the
car without the possession of appropriate credentials.
We tested a variant of this attack by placing a relay
antenna close to a window to activate a key left inside a
closed building (e.g., on a table). This is possible when the
antenna–key range is large such as the 6 - 8 m achieved on
some models.
In such case, if the car is parked close to
the building, the attacker is able to open and start it without
entering the building.
Stealth Attack. The described relay attack is not easily
traced. Unless the car keeps a log of recent entries and
records exchanged signals (e.g., for later analysis), it will

distance from which this attack can be mounted.
be difﬁcult for the owner to know if his car was entered and
driven. Similarly, it will be difﬁcult for the owner to prove
that he is not the one that actually opened and used the car.
This is because there will be no physical traces of car en-
try. This can have further legal implications for car owners
in case that their cars or property from their cars are stolen
due to this PKES vulnerability.
Combination with Other Attacks. Signiﬁcant security
vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in computer systems of
modern cars [27], allowing for example to control safety
systems such as brakes or lights from the car internal com-
munication bus. One of the most dangerous results of this
study is the demonstration of rootkits on car computers that
allow an attacker to take control of the entire car. Moreover,
the malicious code could erase itself leaving no traces of the
attack. The practical risks of such attacks is reported to be
reduced as the attacker needs access to the ODB-II commu-
nication port, which requires to be able to open the car. The
relay attack we present here is therefore a stepping stone
that would provide an attacker with an easy access to the
ODB-II port without leaving any traces or suspicion of his
actions. Moreover, as the car was opened with the original
key if an event log is analyzed it would show that the car
owner did open the car.
6 Countermeasures
In this section we discuss countermeasures against re-
lay attacks on PKES systems. We ﬁrst describe immediate
countermeasures that can be deployed by the car owners.
These countermeasures largely reduce the risk of the relay
attacks but also disable PKES systems. We then discuss
possible mid-term solutions and certain prevention mecha-
nisms suggested in the open literature. We ﬁnally outline
a new PKES system that prevents relay attacks. This sys-
tem also preserves the user convenience for which PKES
systems were initially introduced.
6.1
Immediate Countermeasures
6.2 Mid-term Countermeasures
Shielding the Key One obvious countermeasure against
relay attacks is to prevent the communication between the
key and the car at all times except when the owner wants to
unlock the car. The users of PKES-enabled cars can achieve
this by placing the car key (fob) within a protective metallic
shielding thus creating a Faraday cage around the key. A
small key case lined with aluminum might sufﬁce for this
purpose. While the key is in the key case, it would not re-
ceive any signals from the car (relayed or direct). When the
user approaches the car, he could take the key out of the
case and open and start the car using the PKES system. The
users who would opt for this countermeasure would loose
only little of the convenience of PKES. Similar countermea-
sures have been proposed to block the possibility of remote
reading of RFID tags embedded in e-passports. However,
an attacker might be able to increase the reading power suf-
ﬁciently to mitigate the attenuation provided by the protec-
tive shield. We note that designing a good Faraday cage is
challenging [36]. Still, this countermeasure would make the
relay attack very difﬁcult in practice.
Removing the Battery From the Key Another counter-
measure against relay attacks is to disable the active wire-
less communication abilities of the key. This can be simply
done by removing the battery that powers the radio from the
key. As a consequence, the UHF radio of the key will be de-
activated. The key will then be used in the “dead battery”
mode, which is provided by the manufacturers to enable the
users to open the car when the key battery is exhausted. In
this case, the car cannot be opened remotely but only using
a physical key (the backup physical key is typically hidden
within the wireless key fob). Given that the cars that use
PKES cannot be started using a physical key, in order to
start the car in the “dead battery” mode, the user needs to
place the key in the close proximity of some predesignated
location in the car (e.g., the car Start button). The car then
communicates with the key’s passive LF RFID tag using
short-range communication. Typically, wireless communi-
cation with the LF RFID tags is in the order of centimeters,
thus making the relay attack more difﬁcult for the attacker;
however, depending on the attacker capabilities relay from a
further distance cannot be fully excluded. This defense dis-
ables the PKES for opening the car, but is still reasonably
convenient for starting the car engine. With such a defense,
the realization of a relay attack becomes very difﬁcult in
practice.
A combination of the two countermeasures would pro-
vide the highest protection, but would also be the least con-
venient for the users. It would essentially reduce the usabil-
ity of a PKES key to the one of the physical key.
While the previous countermeasures require only simple
actions from the car owner, and without involvement of the
manufacturer, they also signiﬁcantly reduce the usability of
the key system. Here, we present some lightweight modi-
ﬁcations that provide better usability. Those modiﬁcations
would require only simple software or hardware changes to
the key system. While they are not solving the main cause
of the problem, they do provide mitigation that are appli-
cable immediately (by a software update or a key fob ex-
change or modiﬁcation).
Software Only Modiﬁcation A simple software modiﬁ-
cation to the keyless vehicle unit could be provided to allow
the user to temporally disable the PKES. When a user is
closing the car by pushing the close button on the key fob
the PKES would remain disabled. That is, the car would
open (and allow start) only after the user pushes the open
button on the key fob. This effectively allows the user to
deactivate the PKES system by simply pushing the close
button. This countermeasure would be used for example by
a car owner when parking in a unsafe place such as an un-
derground parking or a public place. On the other hand if
the car is closed by pushing the button on the door handle
or simply by walking away from the car, the PKES system
is used for closing the car and the car would therefore allow
passive keyless entry and start.
Access Control Restrictions At least one car model en-
forced some more strict policy. For example, the car would
quickly stop sending signals after the door handle was
pulled out without detecting the presence of a key. While
not preventing the relay attack it forces the attacker to be
well prepared and to be synchronized, the door handle needs
to be pulled out when the key holder passes in front of the
relaying antenna.
In several cases, on this car model, the alarm was trig-
gered and it was possible to disable it only by pushing the
open button on the key fob. This is certainly deterrent to a
thief. However, this again does not prevent the attack to be
successful.
Hardware Modiﬁcation Adding a simple switch to the
key would produce a similar countermeasure to that of re-
moving the battery from the key fob. This switch would dis-
connect the internal battery allowing the user to temporar-
ily disable the PKES functionality of the key, while keeping
convenience of PKES. Variants of this modiﬁcation would
keep the possibility to use the active open (i.e. opening the
car by pushing the button on the key fob) while deactivating
only the passive entry.
6.3 Countermeasures in the Open Literature
Several countermeasures against relay attacks were pro-
posed in the open literature [6]. We examine them here and
analyze their effectiveness and appropriateness for PKES
systems.
One of the ﬁrst countermeasures proposed against relay
attacks is to rely on the signal strength to indicate the prox-
imity between the devices. This is in fact the countermea-
sure that is used in today’s PKES systems; the car transmits
a short range LF signal such that only if the key is in its
close proximity (≤ 1 m) will it hear the signal. Similarly,
the car could measure the strength of the signal that the key
transmits in order to infer the distance to the key. This
countermeasure is very weak and can be simply defeated
since the attacker can fully mimic the car and the key by
relaying signals using expected signal levels. Other coun-
termeasure that rely on the measurements of signal prop-
erties, like those using complex modulation schemes, mea-
sure group delay times or measure intermodulation prod-
ucts suffer from similar shortcomings. Namely, an attacker
equipped with a good antenna and waveform generator can
mimic expected signal features 12 or can simply relay the
observed signals without demodulating them.
In [6] sig-
nal corruption is also reported as a possible countermea-
sure against relay attacks. However, the authors note that
this countermeasure can be overcome by an attacker using
a good ampliﬁer.
Relay attacks can also be prevented using multi-channel
communication, where typically out-of-band channels are
used to verify if the relay occurred [20]. However, these
approaches require human involvement, and as such are not
well suited for PKES systems.
6.4 Our Proposal: PKES that Relies on RF Dis-
tance Bounding
Like other car entry and start systems, the main purpose
of PKES is to allow access to the car and authorization to
drive to the user that is at the time of entry and start phys-
ically close to the car. By being close to the car, the user
indicates its intention to open the car and by being in the
car, to drive the car. The car therefore needs to be able to
securely verify if the user is close to the car to open the car
and if the user is in the car to start the car.
Given this, a natural way that can be used to realize se-
cure PKES systems is by using distance bounding. Dis-
tance bounding denotes a class of protocols in which one
entity (the veriﬁer) measures an upper-bound on its distance
to another (trusted or untrusted) entity (the prover). This
means that given that the veriﬁer and the prover are mutu-
12See [14] for an example of signal ﬁngerprint replay.
ally trusted, the attacker cannot convince them that they are
closer than they really are, just further 13.
Background on Distance Bounding Protocols
In recent
years, distance bounding protocols have been extensively
studied: a number of protocols were proposed [9, 23, 18,
32, 10, 25, 40, 29, 21, 46] and analyzed [12, 42, 19, 38].
These proposals relied on ultrasonic or RF only communi-
cation. Since ultrasonic distance bounding is vulnerable to
relay attacks [43], RF distance bounding is the only viable
option for use in PKES systems.
Regardless of the type of distance bounding protocol, a
distance bound is obtained from a rapid exchange of mes-
sages between the veriﬁer and the prover. The veriﬁer sends
a challenge to the prover, to which the prover replies after
some processing time. The veriﬁer measures the round-trip
time between sending its challenge and receiving the re-
ply from the prover, subtracts the prover’s processing time
and, based on the remaining time, computes the distance
bound between the devices. The veriﬁer’s challenges are
unpredictable to the prover and the prover’s replies are com-
puted as a function of these challenges. In most distance
bounding protocols, a prover XORs the received challenge
with a locally stored value [9], uses the received challenge
to determine which of the locally stored values it will re-
turn [23, 46], or replies with a concatenation of the received
value with the locally stored value [39]. Authentication and
the freshness of the messages prevents the attacker from
shortening the measured distance.
Recently, two RF distance bounding implementations
appeared, showing the feasibility of implementing distance
bounding protocols. One implemented XOR resulting in a
processing time at the prover of approx. 50 ns [28] and the
other implemented concatenation with the prover’s process-
ing time of less than 1 ns [39].
PKES Requirements for Distance Bounding Implemen-
tation Accurate measurement of the distance is crucial to
defending against relay attacks. The distance is directly pro-
portional to the time of ﬂight of the exchanged messages
between the key and the car. Even more important than the
actual processing time at the key is the variance of this pro-
cessing time. If the key responds in a constant time then the
actual duration of time taken by the key to respond is not
important. Here, we naturally assume that the car trusts the
key. This holds as long as neither the challenge messages
from the car, nor the response messages from the key can
be advanced, i.e., the messages are fresh and authenticated.
Assuming that the delay incurred by the relay attack is
dependent only on the relay cable length (or relay distance
13In the analysis of distance bounding protocols the attack by which an
attacker convinces the veriﬁer and the prover that they are closer than they
truly are is referred to as the Maﬁa Fraud Attack [16].
in the case of a wireless realization), the additional delay
added by the relay attack is proportional to the speed of the
wave propagation in the cable and the length of the cable.
For a standard RG 58 coaxial cable, the wave propagation
speed in that cable is equal to 2/3 of the speed of light in
vacuum (that we denote by c). Therefore assuming that the
UHF reply propagates at the speed of light in vacuum, the
relay with a 30 m long cable adds 30/c + 30/(2c/3) =
250 ns of delay to the measured round-trip time between
the car and the key.
Thus, if the round-trip time measurement in the dis-
tance bounding implementation shows a variance higher
than 250 ns then it will be impossible to detect the above
described attack. If this variance is few orders of magnitude
smaller than the delay introduced by the relay then the ver-
iﬁer will be able to deduce the response time of the key and
therefore be able to compute the distance to the key reliably.
Given that the maximum distance at which the key should
be able to open the door (without action from the user) is at
most 1 m, the maximum standard deviation of the measured
round-trip time should be less than 2/c = 6 ns.
One recent implementation of RF distance bounding [39]
showed that the processing time of the prover (key) can be
stable with a rather small variance of 62 ps. This suggest
that current and upcoming distance bounding implementa-
tions will be able to meet the PKES requirements.

tance bounding would work in the following way. When
