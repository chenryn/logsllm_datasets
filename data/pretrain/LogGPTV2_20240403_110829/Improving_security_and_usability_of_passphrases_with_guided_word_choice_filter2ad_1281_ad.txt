for group 20. This can be explained by the fact that its participants
took the second line of the array at a lower frequency. Similarly,
positional effects could partially explain why the distribution is
closer to Corpus(30) than Corpus(100).
One might expect participants to use mnemonics and create
sentence-like passphrases that used common patterns, but the only
syntactic pattern that appeared more than thrice was 8% of partic-
ipants choosing three nouns in a row. As nouns form the bigger
share of the dictionary used, even those passphrases are secure,
reducing the entropy by at most 5 bits (out of more than 96 bits of
entropy). Surprisingly, having more words to choose from did not
increase the tendency to create syntactically correct sentences but
reduced it instead.
The position bias should not be seen as a weakness of the system
but as another source of its security: as the position is truly random,
a stronger positional bias leads to a more uniform – and higher-
entropy – passphrase. This is true as long as the adversary cannot
get the initial word list, but in such a case the system is already
unsecure.
Word choice patterns held across the range of proficiencies in
English. Those results are true not just for primary English speak-
ers but also for people for whom it is a second language, with
small differences in word choice and no significant difference in
memorability.
The task where participants were supposed to guess each other’s
words had a purpose beyond distracting and impairing their mem-
ory. We were hoping to find whether a simple strategy could explain
the participants’ choices, in which case some would get very good
results. The absence of such successful participants shows that if a
general strategy to explain participants’ choices exists, it has eluded
both us and them.
7Unfortunately we did not compare multiple ways of presenting a word field. While a
linear presentation of the choice words was not tested, it would be likely be much less
user-friendly.
8 CONCLUSION
This paper shows that guiding people to choose from an array of ran-
dom words can build a high-entropy, more memorable passphrase.
Choosing from an array successfully stops people from choosing
easy-to-guess favourite words. The reduction in entropy when com-
pared with random passphrase generation is offset by the improved
usability and memorability that come with choice. Since people
can choose words they know, larger dictionaries can be used. Final
entropy by word then exceeds the levels of random passphrase
generation by 20 − 30%, reaching 95 and 98 bits of entropy.
The main predictor of word choice from the random word array
was how familiar a word was to the participant, for both primary
and non-primary speakers. However, this bias was weaker than
expected and letting people choose from an array gave between
97% and 99% of the maximal entropy achievable, depending on the
size of the array.
Bigger array size (giving more choice to the participant) was
linked to improved memorability of the passphrase. With a 100-
word array, 94% remembered at least 5 of their 6 words the first
time they were asked to recall, despite performing a distractor task.
With actual use, remembering the passphrase should be easy.
The advantage of selecting from an array of random words is
that it gives users an easy way to create secure and memorable
passphrases, with only a random generator and a dictionary. Se-
curity of the guiding array is achieved by only generating it when
needed, locally on the user’s machine. Generating a list which
would then be sent over the network is highly inadvisable as it
drastically lowers the entropy, even more so if the adversary knows
the position of the words. However, this should never be a problem
in practice as the secret array to select from can be produced on
any machine, the dictionary itself and the code needed taking less
than 300KB of memory.
the array compensate for the positional advantage?
task predict long-term memorability for passphrases?
word choice from the presented set even more uniform?
This work demonstrates that large improvements can be achieved
in passphrase usability while increasing their entropy. Below are a
few suggestions for usability/security questions left to test for the
guided passphrase scenario:
• How well does the short-term memorability with a distractor
• Can putting high-frequency words closer to the middle of
• Can other visual presentations, such as word clouds, make
• Would the high uniformity of word frequency be as or even
more successful with even larger dictionaries, for example
with the full SOWPODS and its 276663 words?
• Why is choosing from 100 words more memorable than
choosing from 20? It isn’t because people took longer, as
they didn’t. It might be as it gives users more personalized
choices or the ability to select more familiar words. It might
also be for some not yet explored reason. Does memorability
continue to increase with arrays of more than 100 words?
What is the nature of the trade-off, and must there be a
compromise between entropy and memorability?
• How does the size of the array affect reading patterns and
word choice? Does the left-wise bias in group 20 come from
different reading patterns?

• A significant portion of the errors, both in this study and
previous ones [Yang et al. 2016], come from simple errors
like typos or an added ’s’. It is possible to create an error-
tolerant passphrase authentication system, but how would
one make it compatible with the usual hash-and-compare
techniques?
• Are there even better ways to make highly-memorable high-
entropy passphrases?
Making easy-to-remember passphrases, such as presented here,
should improve security for many purposes. With these demon-
strations, we hope to inspire more work that will make secure
passphrases that are as easy to remember as the song you can’t get
out of your head.
