effectiveness and efficiency of the careflows by means of personalized dashboards built from selected
KPIs, and, in turn, provide additional change suggestions for improved performance.
State-of-the-art and challenges
The success of social networks is fostering researchers to exploit the same technologies for supporting
communities of practice. This type of communities is an important catalyst of research, economic and
social processes (de Moor, 2005) and is in fact driving the evolution of socio-technical systems (Wenger et
al., 2002). In healthcare, these communities bring together medical experts, practitioners, patients and
their families. The related work in this area is rather scarce. Nordqvist (2009) discusses how Web sites
can help chronic patients with the daily management of their disease. Arenella (2010) uses Medscape, a
commonly used online medical education provider, to disseminate palliative care education to health
professionals. Networks of integrated care and research, that combine patients and expertise by sharing
databases and disease registries on the Web, are being developed with the aim of harmonization of
procedures, international epidemiological surveillance, and pharmaco-vigilance (Nurok, 2010).
The careflow collaborative platform must be able to conjugate careflows for case management with wider
applications for social networking and social communities. Collaborative applications have traditionally
faced resistance from healthcare professionals. Inconsistent user interfaces, unclear interaction patterns,
and unintuitive designs are the major underlying causes. Therefore, there is the need to carefully consider
the daily activities, computer literacy, interaction patterns with systems, and sociometrics of healthcare
professionals. To quantify and study professionals’ relationships to develop a sound social network-based
collaborative platform needs to combine social theory and technology.
Innovation and Implications
An important innovation aspect concerns the involvement of all healthcare professionals that are joined in
the collaborative platform. They are coordinated within a “community of practice” represented using
medical social networks. This is a new approach since no social community of practice exists for the
sharing of careflows and dealing with their improvement through formal methods. Up until now, most of
these communities work in an “open-loop” modality, i.e. people can find suggestions, recommended
paths, and so on, but there is no support for final users to be an active part in the improvement process
model. The proposed framework aims at closing the loop, in such a way that caregivers and healthcare
professionals’ feedback becomes the starting point for such improvements. Members of communities
need to share common-ground knowledge in order to discuss careflows based on common terminologies
and concepts. Therefore, the platform and its tools rely on an ontology with a formal definition for
concepts.
Implication 5. Reinforced leadership of industry and strengthened multidisciplinary research excellence
in supporting innovative medical care.
Research methodology
Since the proposed framework for next generation e-health systems and services is intended to guide the
creation of artefacts to serve human purposes, it is amenable to be researched using a Design Science
approach, as discussed by (March and Smith, 1995). In this case, the concrete goal to improve careflows
drives all building and evaluation efforts of the artefacts, namely with utility in mind.
March and Smith (1995) identify and describe four research outputs (artefacts in the form of constructs or
concepts, models, methods, and instantiations) and four research activities (build, evaluate, theorize, and
justify).
The authors state that the outputs can be “instantiated in specific products, physical implementations
intended to perform certain tasks” that operationalize constructs, models, and methods to demonstrate
their feasibility and effectiveness. They add that these instantiations may precede the complete
articulation of the underlying artefacts.

Framework for next generation e-health systems and services
Regarding the research activities, Build is concerned with constructing the artefact, taking into account its
value or utility to a community of users. The key question in this activity is “does the artefact work?”. After
that, Evaluate is concerned with “how well does it work?”. Theorize follows to “explicate the
characteristics of the artefact and its interaction with the environment that result from the observed
performance”. In a nutshell, theorizing clarifies why and how the artefact works. Finally, Justify is
concerned with gathering evidence to test the theory – justifying the explanation.”
The researchers involved in the development of the proposed framework come from different areas, and
include a team that establishes bridges to healthcare institutions where it can be deployed and tested. So
far, the research activities have been centred on base artefacts. We developed concepts (such as careflow
mining, careflow compliance, careflow management, and careflow BI), and started to experiment with
methods to achieve the goals for each area. A first iteration of evaluation, theorization, and justification
lead us to a model – the proposed framework – that will guide the evolution and integration of the base
artefacts into an instantiation of a software platform in a healthcare institution.
Conclusion
Recent developments and programming paradigms have demonstrated the advantages of using process-
driven systems (e.g., Amazon SWF), service-orientation (e.g., Web API and cloud services), and data
analysis (e.g., using map-reduce) to build modern information systems. While these developments found
a quick acceptance by competitive businesses – which have embraced them – they can also bring
substantial benefits for the next generation of e-health systems. Nonetheless, this requires identifying e-
health areas they can be applied more effectively.
We have described a framework centered on the concept of care workflows that brings together five key
areas required for the development of next generation of e-health systems and services: careflow mining,
to elicit actual enacted processes; careflow compliance, to ensure their alignment with clinical guidelines,
and protocols; careflow management, to execute them in a guiding mode; careflow BI, to collect and
process KPIs; and careflow collaboration.
The main limitation of the proposed framework is that it finds a better applicability in healthcare
environments that already use process-aware IS or that have already adopted business process
management initiatives.
