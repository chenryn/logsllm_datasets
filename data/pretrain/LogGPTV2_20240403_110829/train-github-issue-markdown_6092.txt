Below, the `Collection.model` field is supposed to accept **type of`TModel`**
rather than **instance of`TModel`**:
    class Model { }
    class Collection {
        model: typeof TModel; //Error: Could not find symbold 'TModel'.
        models: TModel[];
    }
    class MyModel extends Model { }
    class MyCollection extends Collection {
        // This is what we want
        model: typeof MyModel = MyModel;
        // This is what we don't want
        //model: MyModel = new MyModel;
    }
    var coll = new MyCollection();
    var modelType = coll.model;
    var newModel = new modelType();
Use of `typeof` keyword seems to be appropriate here, but compiler doesn't
understand `typeof` of generic type. If we said `model: typeof Model;` it
would compile but that is not exactly what we want.
Some of the workarounds we found are the followings:
    class Model { }
    class Collection {
            model: { new(): TModel; };
            models: TModel[];
    }
    class MyModel extends Model { }
    class MyCollection extends Collection { }
and
    class Model { }
    class Collection {
            model: TModelConstructor;
            models: TModel[];
    }
    class MyModel extends Model { }
    class MyCollection extends Collection { }
Feature suggestion is to allow `typeof` generic type.
