Question: "A web application implements a multi-layered authentication system including a lock-out mechanism after several failed login attempts, a password strength policy, and a two-factor authentication process. You are conducting a security audit for this application. Which two of the following testing strategies would be most effective in evaluating the robustness of the application's authentication system?"
 "A": "Testing for weak password policy to ensure that the system enforces complex and strong password requirements."
 "B": "Assessing the implementation of the lock-out mechanism to verify it cannot be easily bypassed or does not lock out users prematurely."
 "C": "Evaluating the two-factor authentication process to confirm that it does not add any substantial security and can be omitted."
 "D": "Checking for session management weaknesses to ensure that authenticated sessions are securely handled and not susceptible to hijacking."
Answer: AB
