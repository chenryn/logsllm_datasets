voltage dataset has been made public 5.

In another round of data collection shown at Fig. 9d, we collected
a million CAN messages with timestamps in microseconds using a
PCAN-USB device [22] and the python-can library [48] to collect
these messages while driving the vehicles for about ten minutes.
7.2.1 Ground truth establishment. In the data collected from real-
world vehicles, frames were labelled with IDs only. Since one
ECU can send messages with different IDs, we needed to asso-
ciate these frames with ECUs as well (because SIMPLE aims to
identify ECUs, not IDs). Hence we used Viden and CIDS to as-
sociate IDs with ECUs. Fig. 13 shows these results. For the Nis-
san Sentra, messages IDs fell into the ECU clusters of {374, 375},
{644, 645, 646} , {386} , {533, 534}, and {849}, which will be referred
to as ECUs A, B, C, D, and E hereafter. For the Subaru Outback,
IDs fell into {817, 818, 819, 820}, {593, 594, 595}, {849, 850, 855}, and
{561, 562, 565}, which will be referred to as ECU F through I.
7.2.2 Hill-climbing-style attacks results. We evaluated our attacks
on both voltage-based and clock-based fingerprinting schemes,
using the real-world data. We ran our attacks on ECUs A and B’s

Rather, it is updated based on supply voltage or tempera-
ture measurements (which are assumed to be secure). Thus, even
if the attacker injects multiple malicious messages it cannot shift
the voltage profile. On the other hand, even though the EERs from
our in-vehicle experiments are not 0% in some cases, if the attacker
injects multiple messages, the intrusion will be detected with a
probability that approaches one exponentially. Finally, we note that
it is infeasible for an attacker to generate malicious frames that
exactly mimic the benign frames by replicating their features, since
that will require an Arbitrary Waveform Generator (AWG) [13].

Stability analysis. Long term data collection from Nissan
7.2.5
Sentra shows drift in the features within the period of five months.
Based on experiments in Sec. 7.1.2, the drift in the features that
were used by SIMPLE was linearly correlated with change in the
temperature. Using the average of the estimated linear coefficients
derived in Sec. 7.1.2, we find the temperature estimates for ECU-A
of Nissan Sentra plotted in Fig. 11. The temperature estimates for
the ECU-A were in the range of 45◦C to 52◦C, which is a valid range
for ECUs in a running vehicle. The reason of not having original
ECU temperature data is because the ECU locations are hard to
access, so we validate the model by predicting the ECU tempera-
ture from features and see if they fall into a reasonable range.The
average ambient temperature in Tucson, Arizona on the day of
the data collection is also illustrated in the figure, which shows
a negative correlation between the ambient temperature changes
and the drift in the features. This observation is in agreement with
temperature estimates for ECU-A. ECUs in a vehicle were prone to
drastic temperature changes and that is the reason they had a wide
range of operating temperature. This affected the features used by
any voltage-based IDS, hence cannot be overlooked.
8 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We demonstrated the vulnerability of the existing multi-frame based
automotive intrusion detection and identification systems to a Hill-
climbing-style attack, which allows a compromised ECU to im-
personate another. We also showed the feasibility of our attacks
against Viden [8] and CIDS [9]. Next, we introduced SIMPLE, a
novel intrusion detection and identification system for in-vehicle

data to demonstrate how A was able to impersonate B. The results
are plotted in Fig. 10. We can observe that B’s profile was shifted
gradually to A’s while it never crossed the decision threshold. The
dot markers indicate the moments when the number of attack
frames, m was increased by one, i.e., injection ratio r was increased.
In Fig. 10b, the injection offset δ was also increased because SB was
increased along with r. We plot the results up to only 140 steps due
to the page limit. But from the trend of r, we can see that it will
approach one.
We also calculated the average of number of steps the attack
needed to achieve dominant impersonation. We ran our attack on
every pair of ECUs whose profiles were next to each other. Since
there were multiple IDs associated with one ECU, we were able
to calculate the average numbers of steps. Results show that the
number of steps increased with the difference of voltage profiles
between two ECUs. E.g, the difference of voltage profiles of ECUs
A and B was 0.05; A impersonating B took averagely 115.5 steps.
B impersonating C required 171.75 steps because their profiles’
difference was 0.089.
SIMPLE’s identification results. After associating frames with
7.2.3
ECUs, we tested SIMPLE’s ability to identify the source of a message
when other ECUs impersonate the legit device. The results in terms
of EERs, with their corresponding thresholds, are given at Table 5.
It should be noted that the differential signal was used for feature
extraction for noise cancellation purposes.
7.2.4 Robustness against the Hill-climbing-style attack. Unlike pre-
vious CAN IDS schemes, SIMPLE makes an identification decision
for each individual frame. On average, the source of each frame is
correctly identified (and intrusion is detected) with probability of
1 − EER. We note that the hill-climbing style attack is no longer
feasible against SIMPLE, because the identification threshold is
not updated using the features or voltage profiles across multiple
