Instead of going to the "NEXT" challenge when we click the green box "Submit
and go to the next challenge", the page should go to the "NEXT UNSOLVED"
challenge.
I know this is really a cherry on the cake type of issue but in major updates
such as the last one, it is really annoying to go through each challenge even
though I've already completed it.
