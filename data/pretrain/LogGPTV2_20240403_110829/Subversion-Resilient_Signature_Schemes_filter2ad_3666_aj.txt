undetectable w.r.t. SS but it is not u-users publicly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS (for any
u ≥ 2).
(iv) (sUND (cid:57) u-sUND) Assuming that PRGs exist, there exist a signature scheme SS, a SA
class A against SS and an eﬃciently samplable distribution DA over A, such that A is
1-user secretly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS but it is not u-users secretly DA-undetectable
w.r.t. SS (for any u ≥ 2).
(v) (u-sUND (cid:57) sUND) There exist a signature scheme SS, a SA class A against SS and
an eﬃciently samplable distribution DA over A, such that A is u-users secretly DA-
undetectable w.r.t. SS but it is not 1-user secretly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS (for any
u ≥ 1).
Proof. (i) Towards contradiction, consider a user U that wins the u-users public undetectability
game described in Deﬁnition 22. We build a user U(cid:48) (using U) that wins the u-users secret
undetectability game described in Deﬁnition 22.
User U(cid:48):
1. Receive (vk (cid:96), sk (cid:96)) ←$ KGen(1κ), from the challenger, for (cid:96) ∈ [u], and forward
(vk 1, . . . , vk u) to user U.
2. User U asks polynomially many queries of the type ((cid:96), m) which are forwarded
to the challenger.
3. Output whatever U outputs.
We note that the simulation performed by user U(cid:48) is perfect, therefore U(cid:48) wins the secret
undetectability game with the same probability that user U wins the public undetectability
game.
(ii) Consider SS to be a randomized signature (with only two valid signatures for each
message m ∈ M), and let SS(cid:48) be its derandomized implementation s.t. sk(cid:48) := (sk , b), vk(cid:48) := vk ,
and σ(cid:48) := Sign(sk , m; b), for a random b ∈ {0, 1}. Let A = {(cid:101)A} be the class of SAs for SS(cid:48)
which consists of a single algorithm described next.
(cid:101)A((sk , b), m):
1. Let b(cid:48) := 1 − b (i.e., b(cid:48) is the complement bit of b).
2. Output σ := Sign(sk , m; b(cid:48)).
Let DA be the distribution over A that always returns(cid:101)A. We note that the class of SAs A is 1-
user publicly DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS(cid:48), i.e. any PPT user U has only a negligible probability
of winning at the public undetectability game described in Deﬁnition 8. On the other hand, a
user U playing the secret undetectability game (with knowledge of sk(cid:48) = (sk , b)) can easily detect
the subversion by simply comparing the output of the target oracle with that of Sign(sk , m; b(cid:48)).
(iii) and (iv) Consider SS to be a public-coin signature scheme, so that the signature of a
message m ∈ M is σ(cid:48) := σ||r := Sign(sk , m; r), where r ∈ R are the coins sampled to generate
σ. Let A = {(cid:101)A¯r,τ =0}¯r∈R to be class of SAs for SS described next.
40
(cid:101)A¯r,τ (sk , m):
1. If τ = 0 then set r := ¯r, else set r ←$ R;
2. Set τ := τ + 1;
3. Output σ||r := Sign(sk , m; r).
Let DA to be the uniform distribution over A. Clearly, the class A is 1-user publicly/secretly
DA-undetectable w.r.t. SS, because the output of the subverted signature algorithm is indis-
tinguishable from that of the real signing algorithm even for the ﬁrst query (when τ = 0).
However, the class A is clearly 2-users publicly/secretly DA-detectable w.r.t. SS, since it suf-
ﬁces to ask one query for each signing key (i.e., each signing oracle) and compare the last part
of the signatures (i.e., the random coins).
(v) Consider SS to be any signature scheme. Let A = {(cid:101)Aτ =0κ} be the class of SAs for SS
(cid:101)Aτ (sk , m):
which consists of the algorithm described next.
1. If τ (cid:54)= sk and τ (cid:54)= 0κ then σ := ⊥;
2. Else, σ ←$ Sign(sk , m);
3. τ := sk ;
4. Output σ.
Let DA be the distribution that always returns(cid:101)A0κ. A user U playing the secret undetectability
game of Deﬁnition 8 can easily win the game by making two queries with diﬀerent signing keys;
if the answer to the second query is ⊥, then U detects the subversion. On the other hand, all the
queries made by a user U(cid:48) playing the u-users secret undetectability game of Deﬁnition 22 will
only produce a real signature, since a single signing key is used for each copy of the subversion
oracle.
Comparison between undetectability and multi-user undetectability. The above the-
orem shows that the secret undetectability notion of Deﬁnition 8 is actually incomparable to the
multi-user secret undetectability notion of Deﬁnition 22. (For public undetectability, instead,
Deﬁnition 8 is equivalent to Deﬁnition 22 with u = 1.) The latter is due to the fact that in the
game of Deﬁnition 8 the challenger queries a single oracle, whereas in the game of Deﬁnition 22
the challenger queries diﬀerent copies of the same oracle (one for each signing key).
This diﬀerence creates a gap between the two notions in the case of stateful SAs. Nev-
ertheless, it is possible to slightly modify our attack from Section 4.2 in order to get secret
undetectability in the multi-user setting.23 On the other hand, for stateless SAs secret unde-
tectability as per Deﬁnition 8 does imply u-users secret undetectability as per Deﬁnition 22 (for
any u ∈ poly(κ)); in particular, the attack described in Fig. 1 is already secretly undetectable
in the multi-user setting.
7.3 Multi-User Signing Key Recovery
In this section, we extend the key recovery deﬁnition (Deﬁnition 9) for the multi-user setting.
23Brieﬂy, we generate the biased randomness via a PRF (instead of a PRG); the PRF has a ﬁxed key, hard-wired
in the subverted algorithm, and takes as input the signing key of each user and a counter that is incremented on
every call.
41
Deﬁnition 23 (Key recovery—Multi-user setting). Let SS = (KGen, Sign, Vrfy) be a signature
scheme, A be some class of SAs for SS, and DA be an eﬃciently samplable distribution over
A. We say that adversary B recovers the signing key of all u(κ)-users of SS w.r.t. message
sampler M and distribution DA if there exists a non-neglible function ε : N → [0, 1], such that
P [B wins] ≥ ε(κ) in the following game:
1. The challenger runs (vk (cid:96), sk (cid:96)) ←$ KGen(1κ) and samples (cid:101)A(cid:96) ←$ DA, for each (cid:96) ∈ [u], and
many times: Upon an empty input, the oracle samples m ←$ M, computes(cid:101)σ ←(cid:101)A(cid:96)(sk (cid:96), m),
and sends (m,(cid:101)σ) to B.
2. For each (cid:96) ∈ [u], adversary B is given access to an oracle that can be queried polynomially
gives (vk 1,··· , vk u) to B.
3. Finally, B outputs the keys (sk(cid:48)
(cid:96) = sk (cid:96) for all (cid:96) ∈ [u].
As in Deﬁnition 9, we note that M is a message sampler algorithm, that chooses the message
to be signed according to some pre-deﬁned strategy.
u); we say that B wins iﬀ sk(cid:48)
1,··· , sk(cid:48)
Both attacks from Section 4 satisfy Deﬁnition 23, meaning that they can recover the signing
keys of all users of the scheme. More precisely, for the attack of Fig. 1, the key recovery
probability of adversary B, described in Theorem 1, is ε ≥ (1−εprf−(cid:96)e−q/(cid:96)−q2τ 2·2−η−1−q·2−τ )u.
For the attack of Fig. 2, the key recovery probability of adversary B, deﬁned in Theorem 2, is
ε ≥ (1 − νext · (cid:96)/d)u.
