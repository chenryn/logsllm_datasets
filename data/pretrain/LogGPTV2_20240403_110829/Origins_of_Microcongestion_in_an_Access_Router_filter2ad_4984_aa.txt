Abstract. Using an authoritative data set from a fully instrumented
router at the edge of a core network, packet delays through an access
link are studied in detail. Three diﬀerent root causes of delay are iden-
tiﬁed and discussed, related to: unequal link bandwidth; multiplexing
across diﬀerent input links; and traﬃc burstiness. A methodology is de-
veloped and metrics are deﬁned to measure the relative impacts of these
separate, though inter-related, factors. Conclusions are given regarding
the dominant causes for our representative data set.
1 Introduction/Motivation
Recent studies have shown that backbone networks are highly over-provisioned,
and so inﬂict very little loss or delay on packets traversing them. For example,
despite core routers with output buﬀers capable of holding on the order of 1
second of data, delays rarely exceed millisecond levels [1]. When examined on ﬁne
time-scales however, during localised periods of congestion, or ‘microcongestion
episodes’, delays can still reach levels which are of concern to core network
providers bound by Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
Typically backbone networks are structured in a hierarchy, where link band-
widths decrease as one moves from the long haul links connecting diﬀerent Points
of Presence (PoPs) (currently OC-192), through those interconnecting core rou-
ters within a PoP (OC-48 to OC-192), down to access links connecting customers
to access routers (OC-3, OC-12 or gigabit Ethernet). The access links, being
closer to the edge of the network, are more interesting to study from the de-
lay perspective for two reasons. First, the list of potential causes of delays in a
network widens as we move toward the edge. Second, an access link is typically
managed by the customer. SLAs therefore do not apply and the link may be run
at higher load levels to lower costs, again increasing the potential for congestion.
The aim of this work is to examine in detail the causes of microcongestion
episodes in an access router leading away from the core, with a particular em-
phasis on delays. Although a full separation is not possible, there are nonetheless
diﬀerent generic ‘causes’ or mechanisms of congestion in general, and delay in
particular, which can be identiﬁed. Brieﬂy, these are related to: i) Reduction in

link bandwidth from core to access, ii) Multiplexing of multiple input streams,
iii) Degree and nature of burstiness of input traﬃc stream(s). To our knowledge
a taxonomy of congestion on an access link (or indeed any link) along these lines
has not been studied previously. In particular we seek to answer the question,
“What is the dominant mechanism responsible for delays?”, in such a context.
More generally, a knowledge of the relative importance of diﬀerent causes of
higher than usual delay, and their interactions, gives insight into how delays
may evolve in the future, and not only for the access router we study here. Ac-
cordingly, one of our main contributions is a methodology and a set of metrics
which can be used more generally to this end.
We ﬁrst ﬂesh out the mechanisms above in more detail in the next section.
We then give a description of our data and experimental setup in section 3. We
describe our results in section 4 and summarise in section 5.
2 Congestion Mechanisms
Fundamentally, all congestion is due to one thing – too much traﬃc. The diﬀerent
mechanisms above relate to diﬀerent ways in which traﬃc can be built up or
concentrated, resulting in a temporary shortage of resources in the router. To
explain the mechanisms precisely, we must have a model of router operation,
as it is the router which will multiplex traﬃc arriving from diﬀerent high speed
links, and deliver it (in this case) to the lower speed output link.
In recent work [2] we looked at the modelling question in ﬁne detail, using
the comprehensive data set described in the next section. More speciﬁcally, we
studied the through-router delays suﬀered by packets destined for a given output
interface in a modern store and forward router. A model was developed which
consists of two parts: a ﬁxed minimum delay ∆(L) dependent upon packet size
L which models the front end of the router and the transmission across the
switch fabric, and a FIFO queue which models the output buﬀer and serialisa-
tion. We showed that for a store and forward router where the output buﬀer is
the bottleneck, predicted through-router delays follow the measured ones very
precisely. We also showed that, as expected, the FIFO queue part of the model
dominates the delay dynamics. We will use this model below both conceptually
and to generate many of the actual results. We ignore option packets here, which
can have much larger delays but which are very rare.
In the framework of the model, microcongestion can now be precisely un-
derstood as the statistics of delays suﬀered during busy periods, which are time
intervals where the system is continuously busy, but idle to either side. Here by
‘system’ we mean a given output interface and the portion of the router, leading
from the input interfaces, related to it. Note however that packets are deemed
to arrive to the system only after they have fully arrived to one of the input
interfaces involved. For an input link, we will use ‘busy period’ in a diﬀerent
but related sense, to refer to a train of back-to-back packets (corresponding to a
busy period of the output link of the router upstream). We can now discuss the
three mechanisms.

Bandwidth Reduction. Clearly, in terms of average rate, the input link of
rate µi could potentially overwhelm the output link of rate µo  1. The size of AF is an indication of the extent
of the delay increase due to stretching. If the utilisation at the output exceeds 1
then theoretically it will grow without bound.
We present the cumulative distribution function for AF in Figure 2 for each
of the main input streams separately. Less than 5% of the busy periods are

in the ‘linear’ regime with minimal delay detected via AF = 1. The majority
are signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed by the non-linear merging of input busy periods into
larger output busy periods. If instead we had found that in most cases that AF
was close to 1, it would have been an indication that most of the input traﬃc
on that link was shaped at OC-3 rate upstream.
To get a feeling for the size of the values reported in Figure 2, note that a
realistic upper bound is given by AF = 240000, corresponding roughly to a 500ms
buﬀer being ﬁlled (in a single busy period) by 40 byte packets well separated
at the input, that would induce a maximum workload of 129 µs when served at
OC-48 rate. A meaningful value worthy of concern is AF = 1030, corresponding
to delays of 20ms built up from 375 byte packets, the average packet size in our
data.
4.2 Link Multiplexing
To examine the impact of multiplexing across diﬀerent input links, we let the
total stream ST be the full set of measured traﬃc. The rampup period, [ts, tA],
for two busy periods of ST are shown as the topmost curves in Figures 3 and
4. We select our substreams to be the traﬃc from the two OC-48 backbone
links, S1 and S2. By looking at them separately, we again succeed in isolating
multiplexing from the other two mechanisms in some sense. However, the actual
impact of multiplexing is still intimately dependent on the ‘stretch transformed’
burstiness structure on the separate links. What will occur cannot be predicted
without the aid of detailed traﬃc modelling. Instead, we will consider how to
measure what does occur, and see what we ﬁnd for our data.
Figures 3 and 4 show the delay behaviour (consisting of multiple busy peri-
ods) due to the separate substreams over the rampup period. The nonlinearity
is striking: the workload function is much larger than the simple sum of the wor-
kload functions of the two input substreams, although they comprise virtually all
of the total traﬃc. For example in Figure 3 the individual links each contribute
