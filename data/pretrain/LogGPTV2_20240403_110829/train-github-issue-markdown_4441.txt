Hi,  
I am sure this will not be for 2.x series. Somethings that I like if you are
making the 3.0 move.
I have been looking the
https://github.com/symfony/Routing/blob/48c201da53b7c3b787609b0f6702456b86939577/Matcher/RequestMatcherInterface.php#L38
and the method
         public function matchRequest(Request $request)
        {
            $this->request = $request;
            $ret = $this->match($request->getPathInfo());
            $this->request = null;
            return $ret;
        }
defined in
https://github.com/symfony/Routing/blob/48c201da53b7c3b787609b0f6702456b86939577/Matcher/RequestMatcherInterface.php#L38
for the request is made to null. And the only functionality is to get the path
and pass to the match method.
Why not remove the matchRequest itself ?
So it can be made like
    $parameters = $matcher->match($request->getPathInfo());
Also I am seeing the Request from Context can be moved out to make a bundle to
wrap the Router and Http rather than keeping inside the class.
I would like to see Symfony 3.0 as much more better standalone components. And
bundles which wraps the components so they can use
Symfony/RouterHttpFoundationBundle/Router or something like that for easy
usage. So others who make use of standalone don't need to bother too much.
Thank you for hearing.
