method (Figure 4(b)), the situation improves; fewer bit rates are
needed before we can select the optimal one with 95% accuracy. In
the per-link case (Figure 4(c)), for each SNR, it is common for one
bit rate to be the best more than 95% of the time (note that these
results do not imply that the same bit rate is best 95% of the time
for all SNRs).
Figure 5 shows the percentile results for 802.11n networks. Sim-
ilar to the results for 802.11b/g networks, we see that performance
improves as we use a more speciﬁc look-up table. However, unlike
the 802.11b/g networks, we see that, even in a link-speciﬁc setting,
the SNR does not frequently predict the optimal bit rate at least
95% of the time. This is not particularly surprising, as 802.11n has
signiﬁcantly more bit rates than 802.11b/g. Although it may not be
possible to use only SNR data for 802.11n bit rate adaptation, it is
likely that the SNR could be used to reduce the number of probes
used in probe-based bit rate adaptation; we discuss this more in
Section 4.5.
4.3 Consequences of Selecting a Suboptimal
Bit Rate
In the previous section, we discussed how frequently our bit rate
selection scheme could select the optimal bit rate. Here, we ex-
amine the penalty of selecting a suboptimal bit rate. Recall that
because the throughput depends on the loss rate as well as the bit
rate, it is possible for a low bit rate that sees little loss to have
throughput comparable to a higher bit rate that sees more loss. If it
is the case that the throughput of the optimal bit rate is comparable
to that of other bit rates, then the more coarsely-grained look-up
tables would still be effective (since selecting a suboptimal bit rate
would not affect performance signiﬁcantly).
In this section, we are concerned with quantifying the potential
loss in throughput that occurs from using our simple bit rate selec-
tion method versus using the optimal bit rate every time (i.e., using
a scheme with perfect knowledge). Because our throughput mea-
surements are upper bounds on the actual throughput, it is possible
that we would see higher losses in practice. Nonetheless, we ex-
pect these results to be indicative of the differences we would see
between each of our methods in practice.
To determine this loss, for each of our three strategies, we cre-
ate the appropriate look-up table. Then, for every probe set P, we
calculate two quantities: the throughput of the probe in P sent at
the optimal bit rate, and the throughput of the probe in P sent at
the rate that we would have selected using the look-up table. Fig-
ure 6(a) shows the CDF of these differences for 802.11b/g, for each
of the three cases. In addition to the link-, AP-, and network-based
approaches, we also show the results for a global look-up table (dis-
cussed previously) for comparison. We choose to show absolute
differences instead of relative differences as we ﬁnd these values to
be more instructive. For instance, a 100% loss in throughput could
be from 2Mbit/s to 1Mbit/s, or 40Mbit/s to 20Mbit/s; we consider
the latter case to be much worse.
The most interesting conclusion from this graph is that there is
very little difference between network-wide and global training, but
that link-speciﬁc and AP-speciﬁc training are considerably better.
These ﬁndings suggest that many individual networks may well ex-
hibit the degree of variation that one might only expect across a
range of different networks, insofar as throughput results are con-
cerned. On the other hand, it generally takes far more bit rates to
achieve the 95th-percentile using a global lookup table than it does

using a network-based lookup table (this graph was not shown in
the previous section).
Figure 6(b) shows the CDF of the corresponding throughput
differences for 802.11n. Here, the difference between network-
wide training and global training is more substantial, and both ap-
proaches are inferior to link-speciﬁc training to produce the look-up
table. The absolute throughput difference that we see is generally
much higher than in the 802.11b/g networks. There are two reasons
for this: ﬁrst, 802.11n is capable of much higher throughput than
802.11b/g, so we can see throughput differences in 802.11n that
are simply not possible in 802.11b/g. Second, as we have seen in
Figure 5, the SNR is not as good a predictor in 802.11n networks
as it is in 802.11b/g networks, and thus we are more likely to see
