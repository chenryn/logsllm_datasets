by making a set of topology changes, as indicated by the
vertical lines immediately following the dip, and recovers in
about 40 seconds.
We now consider how the RTTs to individual receivers
vary during a session. Figure 5 plots the cumulative dis-
tribution of the RTT estimates to every receiver. For each
receiver, there is usually at least one RTT estimate every
second, for the entire duration of the session. Each curve
corresponds to a particular receiver, and each point indicates
the fraction of the RTT estimates to that receiver that have
an RTT lower than a particular value. For all receivers, over
94% of the RTT estimates are less than 200 ms, while over
98% of the RTT estimates are less than 400 ms. Assuming
that one-way latency is one half of the RTT, this indicates
that end-to-end latencies are lower than 100 ms most of the
time, and less than 200 ms almost all the time.
6.2 Comparison of Schemes for Overlays
We present detailed results of our comparisons of several
schemes for constructing overlay trees on the Internet. We
begin our comparison study with the Primary Set and a
source rate of 1.2 Mbps. Internet paths between most pairs
of hosts in the Primary Set
can sustain throughputs of
1.2 Mbps. Thus, this study represents a relatively less het-
erogeneous environment where simpler schemes could poten-
tially work reasonably well. Next, we consider the Primary
Set, but at a source rate of 2.4 Mbps. This environment is
more stressful to our schemes for two reasons. First, fewer
Internet paths in the Primary Set are able to sustain this in-
creased source rate and thus, this represents an environment
with a higher degree of heterogeneity. Second, several hosts
in our test-bed are located behind 10 Mbps connections, and
a poorly constructed overlay can result in congestion near
the host. Thus, schemes that work well at 1.2 Mbps po-
tentially work less well at 2.4 Mbps. Finally, to stress our
scheme Bandwidth-Latency, we consider an extremely het-
erogeneous environment represented by the Extended Set,
and assuming a source rate of 2.4 Mbps. We believe our
choice of source rates is realistic and representative of cur-
rent and emerging high bandwidth video applications.
6.2.1 Primary Set at 1.2 Mbps Source Rate
Figure 6 plots the mean bandwidth against rank for four
diﬀerent schemes. Each curve corresponds to one scheme,
and each point in the curve corresponds to the mean band-
width that a machine of that rank receives with a particular
scheme, averaged across all runs. The error-bars show the
standard deviation. Thus they do not indicate conﬁdence in
the mean, rather they imply the degree of variability in per-
formance that a particular scheme for constructing overlays
may involve. For example, the worst-performing machine
(rank 1) with the Random scheme, receives a bandwidth of
a little lower than 600 Kbps on average. We use the same
way of presenting data in all our comparison results.1
We wish to make several observations. First, the Se-
quential Unicast
test indicates that all but one machine
get close to the source rate, as indicated by one of the top
lines with a dip at rank 1. Second, both Bandwidth-Latency
and Bandwidth-Only are comparable to Sequential Unicast.
They are able to ensure that even the worst-performing ma-

rate for the Primary Set of machines
chine in any run receives 1150 Kbps on average. Further,
these schemes can result in consistently good performance,
as indicated by the small standard deviations. Interestingly,
these schemes result in much better performance for the
worst-performing machine as compared to Sequential Uni-
cast. It turns out this is because of the existence of patholo-
gies in Internet routing. It has been observed that Internet
routing is sub-optimal and there often exists alternate paths
between end system that have better bandwidth and latency
properties than the default paths [12]. Third, the Random
scheme is sub-optimal in bandwidth. On average, the worst-
performing machine with the Random scheme (rank 1) gets
a mean bandwidth of about 600 Kbps. Further, the perfor-
mance of Random can be quite variable as indicated by the
large standard deviation. We believe that this poor perfor-
mance with Random is because of the inherent variability
in Internet path characteristics, even in relatively well con-
nected settings.
Figure 7 plots mean RTT against rank for the same set
of experiments. First, the RTT of the unicast paths from
the source to the recipients can be up to about 150 ms,
as indicated by the lowest line corresponding to Sequential
Unicast. Second, Bandwidth-Latency is good at optimizing
the overlay for delay. The worst machine in any run has
an RTT of about 160 ms on average. Third, both Random
and Bandwidth-Only perform considerably worse. While
Random results in an RTT of about 350 ms for the worst
machine on average, Bandwidth-Only results in an RTT of
about 250 ms. Both Bandwidth-Only and Random can have
poor latencies because of suboptimal overlay topologies that
may involve criss-crossing the continent. In addition, Ran-
dom is unable to avoid delays related to congestion, particu-
larly near the participating end hosts, while Bandwidth-Only
may beneﬁt due to some correlation between bandwidth and
delay.
We have also evaluated Prop-Delay-Only and Latency-
Only under this setting, and ﬁnd that they performs sim-
ilarly to Bandwidth-Latency in RTT, and slightly worse in
bandwidth. We omit the results for clarity. Further, given
the poor performance of Random, even in very simple set-
tings, we do not consider it further in our evaluation.
6.2.2 Primary Set at 2.4 Mbps Source Rate
In this section, we focus on the performance comparison
between Bandwidth-Latency and two delay-based schemes,
Prop-Delay-Only and Latency-Only. Figures 8 and 9 present
the mean bandwidth and RTT against host rank for four dif-
ferent schemes.
First, we observe that the paths from the source to most
receivers can sustain bandwidths of up to 2.4 Mbps, as indi-
cated by the Sequential-Unicast
test. Second, Bandwidth-
Latency comes very close to achieving this benchmark, and
can outperform Sequential Unicast for machines with lower
rank. Next, we observe that both Latency-Only and Prop-
Delay-Only perform poorly in bandwidth. For machines of
rank 1–5, Bandwidth-Latency can outperform Prop-Delay-
Only and Latency-Only by over 500 Kbps. While Prop-
Delay-Only and Latency-Only can provide reasonable per-
formance at source rates of 1.2 Mbps, they are unable to
provide good performance in bandwidth at 2.4 Mbps with
the same set of machines.
