provides some indication that a small “constant” optimal
oblivious ratio is possible as ISP networks scale up. Second,
we also use these simple topologies to better illustrate to the
reader our metrics and notion of a good “demand oblivious”
routing.
These two families of topologies are highly homomorphic
(“look the same” from any node). We will ﬁnd the following
lemma useful for analyzing them:
Lemma 6.1. If two nodes u and v are homomorphic un-
der some homomorphism H, then there exists an optimal
oblivious routing such that the routing from u to a node w
on an edge e is equal to the routing from v = H(u) to H(w)
on the edge H(e).
Figure 3 uses the C6 topology (Figure 3 (a)) to illustrate
the issues in selecting a good routing. Consider ﬁrst a TM
that constitutes of a positive demand on the single OD pair
0 → 1. The optimal routing for this TM (that is, the routing
that minimizes the maximum utilization) balances the load
on the two disjoint paths from 0 to 1: half the demand ﬂows
on the direct edge (0, 1) and the other half on the 5-edge
path (0, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) (this “even-split” routing is illustrated
in (b)). Observe that the shortest-path routing, which sends
the ﬂow of each OD pair on the shorter of the two available
paths (that is, for our TM it would send all ﬂow on the
direct edge (0, 1)), has performance ratio of 2 on our TM,
as the maximum link utilization obtained by this routing
is double that of the even-split routing. We next consider
another simple TM where there are unit demands on all
“consecutive” OD pairs i → (i + 1)mod 6 (for i = 0, . . . , 5),
and no demand on other pairs. We ﬁrst consider routing
the demand of each OD pair evenly on the two available
paths (using the “even-split” routing we used in part (b)).
The ﬂow routes of the routings on this TM are illustrated
in part (c) of the ﬁgure: The solid lines indicate the routes
used by the shortest-path routing. The solid and dotted
paths together are used by the even-split routing, which in-
duces a ﬂow of half from every OD pair demand on every
edge. We thus obtain that the even-split routing has link
utilization of 3. In contrast, the shortest-path routing (solid
lines in (c)) would send on each edge only the demand due
to the very same OD pair, resulting in maximum link uti-
lization of 1. Thus, the performance ratio of the even-split
routing on this TM is at least 3 (in fact, it is exactly 3 since
the direct routing is optimal). The same argumentation can
be carried over to other cycle topologies Cn; it is not hard
to see that the even-split routing would have utilization of
n/2 and performance ratio of n/2 (since the shortest-path
routing has maximum utilization of 1).
What this means is that the even-split routing is a bad
oblivious routing. The next question to ponder about is
ﬁnding a good oblivious routing. We now consider general
TMs and argue that the shortest-path routing has oblivious
ratio of 2. The shortest-path routing for all OD pairs that
utilize the edge (0, 1) is illustrated in part (d) of the ﬁgure.
Consider an arbitrary TM, and the edge with highest utiliza-
tion according to the shortest-path routing. Without loss of
generality we can assume that this edge is (0, 1). We refer to
the edge (3, 4) as the “opposite edge” from (0, 1). (In general
for even valued n, the opposite edge of (i, (i + 1)mod n) on
Cn is the edge (i + n/2, (i + 1 + n/2)mod n).) It is not hard
to verify the following property: for every OD pair that its
demand is routed by the shortest-path routing on the edge
(0, 1), the two edges (0, 1) and its opposite edge (3, 4) “dis-
connect” the pair (the two edges are “cut” edges). What
this means is that for any routing, the sum of ﬂows that
are due to demand 0 → 1 on the edge (0, 1) and its oppo-
site edge must be at least the demand between 0 and 1. It
follows that for any routing, the maximum utilization over
the two edges (0, 1) and its opposite must be at least half
of the utilization of (0, 1) under shortest-path routing. We
thus obtain that the performance ratio of the shortest-path
routing is at most 2.

We next provide a formal proof that states that the best
possible performance ratio for the cycle Cn is 2 − 2/n. We
shall see that the optimal oblivious routing will send some
ﬂow along the longer path (but most ﬂow along the shorter
path). We use the following notation: we number the nodes
of Cn as 0, . . . , n − 1, with node numbers taken modulo n,
so that the edges are (i, i + 1) and (i + 1, i). fa,b(i, j) is the
oblivious routing ﬂow for demand a → b on edge i → j.
Lemma 6.2. The optimal oblivious performance ratio for
Cn (the cycle on n vertices) is 2 − 2/n.
Proof. We ﬁrst show that the ratio is at least 2 − 2/n:
From symmetry (see Lemma 6.1) and ﬂow conservation con-
siderations, there is an optimal oblivious routing of the fol-
lowing form: for some xi ≥ 0,
∀a, k ∈ [1, n − 1], ∀i ∈ [0, k − 1] :
∀a, k ∈ [1, n − 1], ∀i ∈ [0, n − k − 1] :
fa,a+k(a + i, a + i + 1) = xk
fa,a+k(a − i, a − i − 1) = 1 − xk
for all other a, b, c, d :
fa,b(c, d) = 0
∀k ∈ [1, n − 1] :
xk = 1 − xn−k
For any a, a demand a → (a + 1) of size 2 can be routed
within unit capacities, so from the load on edge (a, a + 1),
we have that the optimal ratio is at least
2 ∗ fa,a+1(a, a + 1) = 2x1 .
On the other hand, a demand for all a → a + 1 (a = 0 . . . n−
1) of size 1 can also be routed within unit capacities, so from
the load on a particular edge (a, a+1), we have that the ratio
is at least
fa−i,a−i+1(a, a + 1) = x1 + (n − 1)(1 − x1) .
X
i=0...n−1
From the above two bounds we obtain that the optimal ratio
is at least
max{2x1, x1 + (n − 1)(1 − x1)} ≥ 2 − 2/n .
(the maximum is minimized when x1 = (n − 1)/n).
It remains to show that the optimal ratio is at most 2 −
2/n. Consider the routing obtained by setting xk = (n −
k)/n, we show that this routing has oblivious performance
ratio of at most 2−2/n. Consider, without loss of generality,
the edge (0, n − 1). A demand da,b, with 0 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1,
must either be routed using the edge (0, n− 1), or be routed
on the path (a, a + 1, . . . , b), using b − a edges. Similarly,
a demand db,a with 0 ≤ a < b ≤ n − 1 must either be
routed using the edge (n − 1, 0) or be routed on the path
(b, b − 1, . . . , a) using b − a edges. Consider now a TM that
can be routed such that each edge has at most 1 unit of ﬂow
on it.
It suﬃces to show that our routing has utilization
at most 1 − 2/n on that TM. Consider such demands and
supposed that the optimal routing for that TM is such that
none of the demands were routed on the edge (0, n−1). Then
the total edge load generated on the edges (0, 1, . . . , n − 1)
would be:
(b − a)(da,b + db,a) .
X
0≤a<b≤n−1
However, at most a total ﬂow of 1 can be routed using the
edge (n−1, 0), so the combined ﬂow on the other n−1 edges
must be at least
(b − a)(da,b + db,a)) − (n − 1)
( X
0≤a<b≤n−1
The total ﬂow on those n − 1 edges must be less than their
total capacity, so we obtain that
(b − a)(da,b + db,a)) − (n − 1) ≤ n − 1 .
( X
0≤a<b≤n−1
The utilization on edge (0, n − 1) of our oblivious routing

For the clique topology, the shortest-path routing, where
the ﬂow of each demand is routed on the direct edge, per-
forms very poorly, with performance ratio of n− 1. We shall
see that the optimal oblivious routing for the clique topology

Lemma 6.3. The optimum oblivious ratio for Kn (the com-
Proof. We ﬁrst show that the ratio is at least 2 − 2/n:
From symmetry (see Lemma 6.1) and ﬂow conservation, we
know that there is an optimal oblivious routing with the
following form: for some x ≥ 0,
for all distinct a, b: fa,b(a, b) = x
(6)
for all distinct a, b, c: fa,b(a, c) =
fa,b(c, b) = (1 − x)/(n − 2)
for all other a, b, c, d: fa,b(c, d) = 0
The minimum s-t cut between any two nodes is n − 1.
Thus, for any given OD pair a, b, a demand a → b of size
(n − 1) can be routed such that the maximum ﬂow on any
edge is 1. By considering such single OD pair demands
a → b, and the edge (a, b), we obtain that the optimal ratio
is at least
(n − 1) ∗ fa,b(a, b) = (n − 1) ∗ x .
We now consider a TM such that there is a demand of
1 for each OD pair c → d (c < d). Such TM can also be
routed within unit capacities by routing each demand c → d
on the “direct” edge (c, d). By considering the ﬂow of our
routing on the edge a → b, we have that the optimal ratio
is at least
1 ∗ fa,b(a, b) + X
c(cid:6)∈{a,b}
x + 2 ∗ (n − 2) ∗ (1 − x)/(n − 2) .
fa,c(a, b) + X
c(cid:6)∈{a,b}
fc,b(a, b) =
from the above two constraints we obtain that the optimal
ratio is at least max{x ∗ (n − 1), 2 − x} ≥ 2 − 2/n (the
maximum is minimized when x = 2/n).
It remains to show that the optimal ratio is at most 2 −
2/n. We will use a routing of the form (6) with x = 2/n, and
show that its oblivious performance ratio is at most 2− 2/n.
Consider a particular edge a → b. Since a and b have degree
n − 1, any TM which can be routed with at most one unit
of ﬂow on each edge must satisfy

7. CONCLUSION
Traﬃc demands on IP networks are hard to estimate and
are dynamic in nature. Good system engineering thus de-
sires a routing that performs well “independently” of traf-
ﬁc demands (or for a wide range of demands). The goal
of our study was to understand the viability of obtaining
such a routing, by exploring the tradeoﬀs between accuracy
of TM estimation and attainable utilization performance of
the routing. We arrive at perhaps unexpected conclusions.
First, it is possible to obtain a surprisingly good routings
with poor or no knowledge of the traﬃc demands: On cur-
rent ISP topologies, there exists a routing that guarantees
performance ratio that is less than 2 on any possible traﬃc
matrix. This “demand oblivious” routing is designed with
no knowledge of the traﬃc matrix taking only the topol-
ogy (along with link capacities) into account. With a very
limited knowledge of the TM we can do much better, often
obtaining a routing with performance ratio that is very close
to 1 even for error margins of 50%-100% in knowledge of the
traﬃc demands. Similarly, one can obtain a ﬁxed routing
that would perform well on an expected range of demands,
thus, reducing the need for routing adjustments when traﬃc
demands shift.
Second, it is unlikely that such a “robust” routing can
be obtained via standard previously-existing tools, it seems
that obtaining close to optimal performance guarantees with
respect to a range of possible demands requires the algo-
rithmic tools we developed and employed here: The OSPF
routings based on the OSPF weights derived for our test net-
works performed badly as the set of demands grows. More-
over, and surprisingly so, even a routing designed to be opti-
mal on a speciﬁc TM deteriorates quickly with the margins
within which the actual demands deviate from the presumed
ones.
