User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk is showing a series of fatal errors occurring in the kernel of a system. The errors include data store interrupts caused by dcbf and icbi, machine check, program interrupts, store operations, machine state register, and a problem state. Additionally, the log shows that the floating point instruction is enabled.
