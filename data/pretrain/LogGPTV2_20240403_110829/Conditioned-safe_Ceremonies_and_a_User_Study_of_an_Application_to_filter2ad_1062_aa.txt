## Abstract
We introduce the concept of a conditioned-safe ceremony, which is similar to a traditional protocol but explicitly includes human participants. Our formulation of a conditioned-safe ceremony draws on principles from human factors and human reliability, such as forcing functions, defense in depth, and the use of human tendencies like rule-based decision making. We propose design principles for building conditioned-safe ceremonies and apply these principles to develop a registration ceremony for machine authentication based on email. We evaluated our email registration ceremony with a user study involving 200 participants. The study was designed to be ecologically valid, employing deception and simulating real-world conditions. We found that email registration was significantly more secure than challenge question-based registration. Additionally, conditioning helped email registration users resist attacks, while it made challenge question users more vulnerable.

## 1. Introduction
In our complex environment, we, like many animals, develop automatic responses to frequently encountered situations. These responses, known as "click-whirr" responses, are triggered by key features of stimuli. Psychologist Robert Cialdini describes these as pre-recorded tapes in our heads, activated by familiar cues. As the world becomes more intricate, we increasingly rely on these automatic responses to navigate daily life. However, this reliance can be exploited by those who create situations that trigger desired click-whirr responses, even if other features differ from past experiences.

Current web authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, often ignore this psychological phenomenon. Social engineering attacks, like phishing, exploit the web's potential for mimicry, conditioning users to automatically enter their credentials on seemingly legitimate sites. To combat these threats, many institutions use machine authentication, which authenticates the user's computer in addition to the user. This requires a registration procedure to authorize multiple machines. Many financial websites use challenge questions for registration, but this method is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, which exploit similar click-whirr responses as password attacks.

### 1.1 Contributions
Given the inevitability of human click-whirr responses, we argue that authentication mechanisms should be designed to reinforce security through these responses. Our contributions include:

1. **Conditioned-Safe Ceremonies:** A ceremony is a protocol that includes human participants. We introduce the notion of a conditioned-safe ceremony, which deliberately conditions users to act in ways that protect them from attacks. Our formulation draws on principles from human factors and human reliability, such as forcing functions, defense in depth, and rule-based decision making.

2. **User Study of Email-Based Registration Ceremony:** We apply our design principles to develop an email-based registration ceremony for machine authentication. We conducted a user study with 200 participants to compare the security of email registration to challenge question-based registration. Our results show that email registration is significantly more secure, with simulated attacks succeeding against 93% of challenge question users but only 41% of email users. Conditioning helped email users resist attacks, while it made challenge question users more vulnerable.

## 2. Why Users Are Vulnerable
Phishing and other social engineering attacks have created a multi-million dollar underground economy. While it is tempting to blame user ignorance, researchers suggest that current security mechanisms, such as passwords and browser security indicators, are poorly suited for human use. Several factors contribute to this vulnerability:

- **Click-Whirr Responses and Rule-Based Decision Making:** Humans prefer rule-based decision making over analytical approaches. Adversaries can exploit this by creating situations that trigger strong-but-wrong rules, leading to insecure decisions.
- **Satisficing Behavior:** Browser security indicators condition users to skip checks and ignore warnings, as the immediate consequences of skipping these checks are rarely visible. Over time, users become conditioned to perform required actions quickly and instinctively, optimizing out optional actions.
- **Difficulty in Recognizing Attacks:** Users often struggle to recognize risky situations, leading to less vigilance. False positives are common, making actual attacks seem rare. This makes it difficult to rely on users to detect and respond appropriately to social engineering attacks.

## 3. Machine Authentication to the Rescue?
To address the rise in social engineering attacks, many institutions have implemented machine authentication, which supplements password-based authentication by authenticating the user's computer. This approach aims to reduce dependency on human detection of attacks. However, the need for a registration ceremony to authorize multiple machines reintroduces human involvement and exposes the system to new attack vectors.

### Challenge Questions
Many financial websites use challenge questions for registration. When a user logs in from an unregistered computer, they must answer these questions to set an authentication cookie. This method is vulnerable to MITM attacks, where an attacker spoofs the login page and forwards the user's credentials to the legitimate site. The attacker then receives the challenge questions, displays them to the user, and forwards the answers to obtain an authentication cookie.

Challenge question-based registration is vulnerable because it disregards human tendencies and conditions users to fall for attacks. Users must actively check browser security indicators, which many misinterpret or ignore due to satisficing behavior. This undermines the promise of machine authentication, as users vulnerable to password phishing are also likely to be vulnerable to challenge question phishing.

## Table 1: Success Rates of Simulated Attacks
| Group | Registration Method | Attack Type | Successful Attacks | Size |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|--------------------|------|
| 1     | Challenge Questions | Solicit Answers | 92.7% (38) | 41 |
| 2     | Email               | Forwarding   | 40.0% (16) | 40 |
| 3     | Email               | Cut and Paste | 30.8% (12) | 39 |
| 4     | Email               | Warnings in Email | 47.5% (19) | 40 |
| 5     | Email               | No Warnings  | 47.5% (19) | 40 |

Users in groups 2 and 4 received contextual warnings in registration emails, while users in groups 3 and 5 did not.
