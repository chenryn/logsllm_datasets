### User Ratings of Authentication Methods

The following table presents the average user ratings for various authentication methods on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates "Not secure at all" or "Very hard to use," and 5 indicates "Very secure" or "Very easy to use." Users rated only the methods they had previously used on their specific devices. Notably, no participants had used iris scanning on VR devices.

### Security and Usability Perceptions

#### Security
Ten users who believe AR/VR devices are less vulnerable to attacks note that the screen on head-mounted displays is hidden from others, making traditional shoulder-surfing attacks infeasible. For example, P020 (M, 25-34) states, "There is no risk of someone looking over your shoulder to see what you are typing." Additionally, five participants feel that using these devices primarily at home or alone enhances security. P011 (M, 25-34) explains, "Someone could theoretically track your controller position to infer your password, but I use VR in my home alone, so I am not more concerned about password entry than I would be for any other computer application."

#### Privacy Concerns
Users also express privacy concerns regarding biometric data collection. Three users are wary of iris scanning due to the collection of biometric data. Six users are concerned about sharing private account information with companies known for poor data practices. For instance, P139 (M, 25-34) says, "The lack of control over my own data is frustrating."

### Perceived Usability

#### Virtual Keyboard Challenges
Despite being the most popular authentication method, passwords receive the most negative feedback. The mean usability score for passwords is 2.6 for AR (SD = 1.42) and 2.9 for VR (SD = 1.26). Many users find the virtual keyboard challenging and physically demanding. Typing in VR typically involves using a virtual laser from controllers to select keys, which is described as "zero fun" by P057 (M, 25-34). In AR, gesture interaction further complicates the process. Moreover, three users (P001, P016, P048) note that AR and VR have minimal support for password managers, requiring frequent manual password entry.

#### Accessibility Issues
Four participants highlight accessibility challenges, particularly for users with physical disabilities. P109 (ND, 18-24) states, "Typing on a virtual keyboard is tolerable for the average user, but can be outright impossible for those with physical disabilities." P078 (M, 18-24) and P021 (M, 18-24) specifically mention difficulties with shaky hands. P021 describes his workaround: "Pointing and clicking at a keyboard without stable hands can make it difficult. I have my own workaround involving stepping back, resetting my POV, and stepping closer to the keyboard." These additional steps add to the already cumbersome process and may deter some users from using AR/VR. P139 (M, 25-34) notes, "Sometimes authentication itself feels like a barrier to entry."

#### Non-Password Methods
Iris scanning receives the highest usability scores for AR, while unlock patterns are preferred for VR. AR users favor paired devices (e.g., scanning a QR code on their phone) over unlock patterns for both usability and security. Paired accounts, such as Facebook, have low usability scores (mean = 3.7, SD = 1.25) on AR devices, often requiring password entry via the virtual keyboard. Other methods, like iris scanning, are appreciated for their ease of use, as noted by P054 (M, 35-44): "It's easy, just keeping your eyes open..." Additionally, infrequent authentication requirements are valued, as P050 (ND, 35-44) explains, "I’m already logged into those accounts, so I don’t have to type my password in again."
