As per HTML5, controls inside the legend first child of a disabled fieldset
are not disabled. This is not a random decision and addresses notably the use
case of having a radio or checkbox control in the fieldset, as part of the
legend, deciding whether that fieldset is enabled or not. Fiddle:

I headed for the source to fix that, but then I saw this comment:
    // Note: HTML5 says that controls under a fieldset > legend:first-child won't
    // be disabled if the fieldset is disabled. Due to implementation difficulty,
    // we don't honor that edge case; we style them as disabled anyway.
Is fixing this issue completely out of the question? If not, could you be more
specific about "implementation difficulty" before I foolishly jump into it?
Right now I'm overriding this with cursor: auto.
