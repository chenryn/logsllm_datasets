while connecting template component with redux. This seems like it worked in
previous version.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Template component connects to Redux successfully.
## Current Behavior
Getting error: `Could not find "store" in either the context or props of
"Connect(Base)". Either wrap the root component in a , or explicitly
pass "store" as a prop to "Connect(Base)".`
If I wrap root component with `` from 'react-redux`, it throws error
that it expects object, not a function.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
store.js
    const initStore = (initialState = {}) => {
      createStore(
        combineReducers({ someReducer, otherReducer }),
        initialState,
        composeWithDevTools(
          applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware),
        ))
    }
template.js
    class Base extends React.Component {
    ...
    render(){
        return (
            {this.props.children}
        )
      }
    }
    ...
    export default withRedux(Store, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Base)
./pages/index.js
    import Template from 'Templates/Base'
    export default class Index extends React.Component {
      render(){
        return (
            {'index'}
        )
      }
    }
## Context
I am wrapping all pages in template component which includes methods and
components that are reused among all pages.
