# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I have eight equally sized zones but if I only have three open windows it
would be better to connect to neighbouring zones and enlarge my windows.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
By pressing the Shift+CTRL key and holding the window between two zones it
should snap over both zones.
