User: In python, I use subprocess.Popen() to launch several processes, I want to debug those processes, but the windows of those processes disappeared quickly and I got no chance to see the error message. I would like to know whether there is any way I can stop the window from disappearing or write the contents in the windows to a file so that I can see the error message later.
Thanks in advance!
Assistant: In windows, the common way of keeping cmd windows opened after the end of a console process is to use cmd /k
Example : in a cmd window, typing start cmd /k echo foo

opens a new window (per start)
displays the output foo
leave the command window opened
