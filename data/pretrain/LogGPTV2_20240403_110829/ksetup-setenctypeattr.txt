Sets the encryption type attribute for the domain. A status message is displayed upon successful or failed completion.
You can view the encryption type for the Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) and the session key, by running the klist command and viewing the output. You can set the domain to connect to and use, by running the ksetup /domain  command.
ksetup /domain 
Syntax
ksetup /setenctypeattr  {DES-CBC-CRC | DES-CBC-MD5 | RC4-HMAC-MD5 | AES128-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 | AES256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96}
Parameters

Examples
To view the encryption type for the Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) and the session key, type:
klist
To set the domain to corp.contoso.com, type:
ksetup /domain corp.contoso.com
To set the encryption type attribute to AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96 for the domain corp.contoso.com, type:
