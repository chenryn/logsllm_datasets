User: I'm trying to switch to Atom Editor for my python projects. I have several of those and each is set up using virtualenv. 
How do I set up this editor, so that when I open up one project it will be using python.exe from its path and not some other? 
I don't want to add anything to the init script because, as far as I understand, this script contains global settings. Is there a way to configure the desired behavior 'per project'?
Assistant: It seems that python-autocomplete plugin is all we need in atom python coding. Just set your virtualenv from the console, then type atom . and editor (accompanied with aforementioned plugin) will pick that up. No other configuration is necessary.
