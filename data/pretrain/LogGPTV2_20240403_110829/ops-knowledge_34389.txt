User: I've been trying to kill a process but all my options give me a Windows Access Denied Error. 
I open the process(a python script) through test= subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, "testsc.py"]) and I want to kill that process.
So far, I've tried os.kill(pid, signal.SIGILL) , os.kill(pid, 9), test.Terminate() and simply test.kill(). All of these give me the error.
I am using Python 2.7.1.4 on a Windows 7 x86 machine. I would appreciate the help! Thanks!
Assistant: Funnily enough, it means that access is denied. You don't have permission to kill the process. This could be due to your account level (a "guest" sort of account or an account restricted by group policy) or it could be due to UAC (admin on your own machine but not running as adminâ€”not sure if Windows 7 allows non-elevated process killing, though I would have thought it would).
