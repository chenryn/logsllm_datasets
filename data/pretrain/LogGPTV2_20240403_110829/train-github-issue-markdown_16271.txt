After an object was removed from scene, it is still referenced by renderItems.
I clear renderItems as below. But the object may be referenced by opaque or
transparent. Once I clear opaque and transparent, nothing is rendered(only
background color)! I don't how to get it fixed. Could you please double check
if the original code is correct and if not how to fix it?
    `function WebGLRenderList() {
    	var renderItems = [];
    	var renderItemsIndex = 0;
    	var opaque = [];
    	var transparent = [];
    	function init() {
    		renderItemsIndex = 0;
    		opaque.length = 0;
    		transparent.length = 0;
    		# renderItems = [];
    	}`
