User: Does anyone know how to associate the py extension with the python interpreter on Mac OS X 10.5.7? I have gotten as far as selecting the application with which to associate it (/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python), but the python executable appears as a non-selectable grayed-out item. Any ideas?
Assistant: The default python installation (atleast on 10.6.8) includes the Python Launcher.app in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Resources/, which is aliased to the latest/current version of Python installed on the system. This application launches terminal and sets the right environment to run the script.
