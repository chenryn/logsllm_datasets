**Question:**
Does anyone know how to associate the `.py` file extension with the Python interpreter on Mac OS X 10.5.7? I have managed to select the application to associate it with (`/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python`), but the Python executable appears as a non-selectable, grayed-out item. Any suggestions?

**Answer:**
In the default Python installation (at least on macOS 10.6.8), the `Python Launcher.app` is included in the `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Resources/` directory. This application is linked to the latest/current version of Python installed on the system. The `Python Launcher.app` opens a terminal and sets up the appropriate environment to run the script.

To associate `.py` files with the `Python Launcher.app` on Mac OS X 10.5.7, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Python Launcher:**
   - Navigate to `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Resources/` and find `Python Launcher.app`.

2. **Set the Default Application:**
   - Right-click on a `.py` file and select "Get Info."
   - In the "Open with" section, click the dropdown menu and select `Python Launcher.app`.
   - Click "Change Allâ€¦" to apply this setting to all `.py` files.

3. **Verify the Association:**
   - Double-click a `.py` file to ensure it opens with the `Python Launcher.app` and runs correctly.

If the `Python Launcher.app` is not available or if you encounter issues, you may need to create a custom launcher or use an alternative method to set the association manually.
