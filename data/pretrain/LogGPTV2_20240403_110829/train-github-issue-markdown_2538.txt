I am currently using the following software versions:
- Node.js v13.12.0
- npm v6.14.1
- Windows 10 (x86), version 1909, build 18363.752

Recently, I updated Node.js on my system. After cloning the Realworld repository, I attempted to install the project dependencies but encountered an error. The detailed npm log for this issue can be found in the file `2020-04-09T04_38_30_115Z-debug.log`.
