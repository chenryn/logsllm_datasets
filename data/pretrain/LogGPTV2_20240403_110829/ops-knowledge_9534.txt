User: Please introduce the difference between the HTTPS protocol and the HTTP protocol and why use the HTTPS protocol?
Assistant: 1. The difference between HTTPS and HTTP protocol: HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure HTTP protocol, which uses SSL/TLS protocol to encrypt the transmitted data to ensure the security of data transmission. Compared with the HTTP protocol, HTTPS adds a data encryption process in the process of data transmission, so the data is protected. 2. Why use the HTTPS protocol? (1) Data transmission security: The HTTPS protocol can encrypt data, and during the transmission process, it can ensure that the data is not stolen or peeped by hackers. (2) Authentication mechanism: The HTTPS protocol can ensure the identity of both parties through the digital certificate authentication mechanism, such as website authentication, to ensure user access security. (3) Search engine optimization: Google and other search engines will give priority to recommending websites using HTTPS, because HTTPS websites can provide a more secure access experience. (4) Support HTTP/2 protocol: HTTP/2 protocol is a relatively new protocol, which is faster and more stable than HTTP/1.1. It adopts multiplexing technology and can provide faster loading speed. At the same time, HTTPS protocol also supports HTTP/ 2 Use of Agreement.
