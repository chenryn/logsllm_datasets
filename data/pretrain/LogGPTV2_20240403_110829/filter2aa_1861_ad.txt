### Slide 121
**Dr. Randall Wald**
"At this point, we engaged our colleagues at Florida Atlantic University to assist in developing some models."

### Slide 122
**Data Mining 101**
- **User ID**: Alice, Bob, Charles
- **Interacts**: N, Y, N
- **Klout Score**: 20, 56, 12
- **Friends**: 46, 1252, 1109

**Concepts Introduced:**
- **Instance**: A single row of data (e.g., the row for Alice).
- **Class**: The target variable to predict (e.g., "Interacts").
- **Features**: Attributes used to make predictions (e.g., Klout score, friend count).

**Goal:**
- Use the features to predict the class.

### Slide 123
**Experiments:**
1. **Identifying Top Features:**
   - Perform feature ranking using multiple algorithms.
   - Identify features that consistently rank highly.

2. **Building Classification Models:**
   - Select top features based on ranking.
   - Evaluate model performance with different learners, rankers, and varying numbers of features.

### Slide 124
"We used Weka, a freely available tool with both a user interface and command-line interface. The book 'Data Mining...' may also be of interest to you."

### Slide 125
**Top Features: Interacted Dataset**
- Here are the top features...

### Slide 126
**Top Features: Interacted Dataset**
- **Klout Score**
- **Friends Count**
- **Followers Count**

**Key Findings:**
- Consistently appearing in the top 3 or 4, these features align with statistically significant results.

### Slide 127
**Top Features: Replied Dataset**
- Now, looking at only the users who replied...

### Slide 128
**Top Features: Replied Dataset**
- **Klout Score**
- **% Follow Friday Tweets**

**Key Findings:**
- Follower and friend counts become less important.
- The percentage of tweets referencing Follow Friday or #FF increases in importance.

### Slide 129
**Classification Results: Interacted Dataset**
- We examined several classification models with different numbers of features...

### Slide 130
**Classification Results: Interacted Dataset**
- **AUC**: 0.68623
- **TPR (True Positive Rate)**: 0.61301
- **TNR (True Negative Rate)**: 0.70719

**Model Performance:**
- The logistic regression (LR) learner, using 40 features (ranked by ROC), achieved the highest AUC.
- The model correctly identified approximately 60% of the people who would interact (TPR) and correctly flagged 70% of users who wouldn't (TNR).

**Graphical Representation:**
- The grey area shows baseline performance.
- False positives are significantly reduced without losing too many true positives.

**Strategy for Bot Creators:**
- Create a bot.
- Test it on a sample group.
- Apply analysis and machine learning.
- Focus on users most likely to respond to the bot.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- While this approach may give ideas to less scrupulous individuals, it is likely that such individuals are already exploring similar strategies.

### Slide 132
**Classification Results: Replied Dataset**
- **More Challenging than Interacted Dataset:**
  - Different models performed well.
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine) outperformed LR.
  - 50 features were optimal instead of 40.
  - Emphasizes the importance of testing different models and parameters for each dataset.

**Performance Metrics:**
- **AUC**: 0.68623
- **TPR**: 0.61301
- **TNR**: 0.70719
- **AUC**: 0.65810
- **TPR**: 0.58588
- **TNR**: 0.73029

**Key Findings:**
- Performance changes slightly when focusing on users who reply rather than those who interact in other ways.

### Slide 133
**Classification Results: Replied Dataset**
- **Precision**: 30.6%
- **N**: 610

**Graphical Representation:**
- Performance remains close to the interacted models.

### Slide 134
**Data Mining Discussion:**
- **Datasets Differ Despite Similar Class Values:**
  - Different second-place features chosen.
  - Varying degrees of classification difficulty and optimal settings.
- **Data Mining Tools:**
  - Help create a more complete picture.
  - Indicate that bot responders are socially involved individuals.

### Slide 135
**Timing:**
- 40 minutes

### Slide 136
**Conclusions:**
- Wrapping up...

### Slide 137
**Extraverts at Greater Risk...**
- Image source: [Buzzle Article on Extrovert Personality](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/extrovert-personality.html)
- People scoring higher in extraversion seem to be more susceptible to interacting with social bots.

### Slide 138
**Models Could Help Botmasters Find Susceptible Individuals...**
- Machine learning can help bot masters target susceptible users or reduce false positives.

### Slide 139
**So What?**
- This work is based on the premise that the days of the "spray and pray" approach for engaging users with social bots are numbered.
- Social bot creators will need to be less noisy to avoid account suspension.
- We considered several use cases. Here are five brief highlights:

### Slide 140
**#1: Marketeers**
- Marketeers looking to increase their brand's Klout (or Kred) score might focus on users more likely to interact.
- Useful for early brand building, but could result in some users receiving more spam.

### Slide 141
**#2: Propagandists**
- AstroTurfers and similar entities can find users most likely to propagate their message or give credence to the bot account.

### Slide 142
**#3: Social Engineers**
- Since the most predictive features (Klout score, number of friends/followers) are easily obtained through API calls, it is straightforward to build models in Maltego.
- Example: Identifying @Alice’s Twitter friends and flagging those more likely to engage in conversation.

### Slide 143
**Privacy Implications:**
- All these scenarios have privacy implications. How might social network providers and their users respond?

### Slide 144
**#4: Usable Security**
- Social network providers can use this knowledge to design usable security controls, warning users when they might be getting "gamed."

### Slide 145
**Example Warning:**
- "It looks like you’re sending a Tweet..."
- Though not as intrusive, warnings should be designed to be effective and unobtrusive.

### Slide 146
**#5: Training:**
- This work suggests that differing human behavior and personality traits need to be considered in training material.
- Current corporate training may not be tailored to those who need it most (those higher in extraversion).
- Users can become more self-aware and check their interactions more rigorously.

### Slide 147
**Future Research Opportunities:**
- **Detailed Big 5 Factors:**
  - Using the Big Five Inventory (BFI) instead of the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI).

### Slide 148
**Future Research Opportunities:**
- **Impulsivity:**
  - Using the Cognitive Reflective Test (CRT) to measure impulsivity.
  - [CRT Link](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Cognitive_Reflection_Test.html)

### Slide 149
**Cognitive Reflective Test (CRT):**
- Example Question: A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
- [CRT Paper](http://www.sjdm.org/dmidi/Cognitive_Reflection_Test.html)

### Slide 150
**Future Research Opportunities:**
- **Target-Centric Approach:**
  - Bots need to engage targets on topics they are interested in.
  - Bots must "fit in" with the group.

### Slide 151
**Positive Uses of Intelligent Agents:**
- Example: OKCupid deployed its own bots to interact with spammers, creating a "secondary world" where bots converse with each other.

**Defending Against Bots:**
