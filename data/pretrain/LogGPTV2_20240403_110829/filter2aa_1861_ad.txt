False Positives.

Class
Features
One this slide we introduce the basic concepts 
of an Instance (e.g. the row featuring Alice), a 
Class (e.g. Interacts) and some features (Klout 
score, friend count etc). The goal is to use the 
features to predict the class. 
Slide 123 
Experiments
● Identifying top 
features
– Perform feature 
ranking with many 
algorithms
– Find features which 
are consistently at 
the top
● Building 
classification models
– Use rankers to select 
top features
– Evaluate model 
performance with 
different learners, 
rankers, and number 
of features
Two experiments were designed. One to 
identify the top features and one to build 
classification models

has both UI and CLI.  The book  Data Mining…

Slide 125 
Top Features: Interacted Dataset
Here are the top features… 
Slide 126 
Top Features: Interacted Dataset
Klout Score
Friends
Followers
Picking out those which consistently appear in 
the top 3 or 4, we see Klout score, Friend Count 
and Follower count (as with the statistically 
significant results). 
Slide 127 
Top Features: Replied Dataset
Now, looking at only the users who replied…. 
Slide 128 
Top Features: Replied Dataset
Klout Score
% Follow Friday
We see that follower/friend count becomes 
less important, by the %age of tweets 
reference to Follow Friday or #FF increases. 
Slide 129 
Classification Results: 
Interacted Dataset
We then examined a number of classification 
models with different numbers of features…. 
Slide 130 
Classification Results: 
Interacted Dataset
AUC 0.68623
TPR 0.61301
TNR 0.70719
We found that the LR learner, using 40 features 
(with a ROC ranker) obtained the highest Area 
Under the Curve (AUC) value.  The model 
correctly identified roughly 60% of the people 
who would interact (That’s the True Positive 
Rate or TPR) and correctly flagged 70% of users 
who wouldn’t (The True Negative Rate or TNR). 
Graphically, this translates to 
Slide 131 
Classification Results: 
Interacted Dataset

Precision = 31.6%
N = 610
The grey area shows what the baseline 
performance would have been.  We can see the 
false positives are greatly reduced without 
removing too many of the false positives.  We 
can reduce the false positives further, but this 
comes at the expense of further reducing the 
true positives. 
So for a bot creator, one strategy is likely to  
• create a bot,  
• launch it against a test group,  
• Apply some analysis & machine learning 
• Use the results to focus on users most likely 
to respond to your own bot. 
Some might argue that we’re giving less 
scrupulous people some ideas, but it’s almost a 
certainty that those people are already 
exploring ideas like this.  
Slide 132 
Classification Results: 
Replied Dataset
● More challenging than Interacted dataset
● Different models performed well
– SVM instead of LR
– 50 features instead of 40
● Demonstrates importance of testing 
different models/parameters on each 
dataset
AUC 0.68623
TPR 0.61301
TNR 0.70719
0.65810
0.58588
0.73029
Performance changes a little when we focus on 
users who reply (rather than reply or follow 
back)

interacted models. 
Slide 134 
Data Mining Discussion
● Datasets differ despite only having different 
class values
– Different second-place features chosen
– Different degrees of classification difficulty, and of 
optimal settings for classification
● Nonetheless, data mining tools able to help 
create more complete picture
– Bot responders are socially involved individuals

Conclusions
So, wrapping up. 
Slide 137 
Extraverts at greater risk…
Image source: http://www.buzzle.com/articles/extrovert-personality.html
People scoring higher in extraversion seem to 
be more susceptible to interacting with social 
bots

personality.html  
Slide 138 
Models could help botmasters find 
susceptible individuals…
Machine learning could help bot masters target 
susceptible users, or at least reduce False 
Positives. 
Slide 139 
So what?
So what?   
Firstly, this work is really based on the premise 
that the days are numbers for the ‘spray & 
pray’ approach to getting users to 
engage/interact with a social bot (or indeed a 
human). i.e. Social Bot creators will need to be 
less noisy to avoid account suspension. 
Assuming this, we considered a number of use 
cases. I’ll highlight (briefly) five of them. 
Slide 140 
#1
#1. Marketeers: Marketeers who are looking to 
get a higher klout (kred etc) score for their 
brand might be able to focus on users who are 
more likely to interact (or engage) with them. 
This might be a useful strategy for the early 
stages of building a brand (fake or otherwise), 
but it could also mean that some users are 
deluged with far more spam than others.  
Slide 141 
#2
Propagandists
#2. AstroTurfers and their ilk: Finding users 
who are most likely to help propagate your 
message or at the very least, give credence to 
the bot account. 
Slide 142 
#3
Social Engineers
#3. Social Engineering Assignments: Since the 
most predictive features (klout score, number 
of friends/follows) are easily obtained through 
API calls, this makes it very easy to build/model 
in Maltego.  Here we can see @Alice’s 
imaginary Twitter friends. A simple Maltego 
local-transform could be used to flag users who 
are more likely to engage in conversation, 
which might prove use for Social Engineers 
looking for weaker points in a social graph. E.g. 
You know the Twitter accounts of users in 
AcmeCorp and want to highlight the ones who 
maybe most likely to talk to you. The red icons 
are the users to focus on.   
Slide 143 
All of these have privacy 
implications, so how might 
social network providers and 
their users respond?
All of these have privacy implications, so how 
might social network providers and their users 
respond? 
Slide 144 
#4 Useable Security
#4 Social Network Providers:  Knowing more 
about how different users behave *may* help 
in the design of usable security controls on 
Social Network platforms, warning users when 
they might be getting “gamed”.   
Slide 145 
“ It looks like you’re sending a Tweet ”
Although hopefully not quite like this… 
Slide 146 
#5 Training : (as previously mentioned) this 
work suggests that differing human 
behaviour/personality traits need to be 
considered in the creation/execution of 
training material.  This isn’t to say training is 
ineffective, but it does say that it’s reasonable 
to hypothesize that current corporate training 
isn’t tailored to the people who need it the 
most (those higher in extraversion). 
It may also be possible for users to become 
more self-aware.  E.g. Am I extroverted? If I am, 
then maybe I need to check who I’m interacting 
with, with a little more rigour.

Future Research Opportunities
• Likely focus on more detailed Big 5 factors
In terms of future research opportunities… 
A greater focus on more detailed Big 5 Factors, 
perhaps using BFI (Big Five Inventory) rather 
than TIPI (Ten Item Personality Inventory).

Slide 148 
Future Research Opportunities
• Likely focus on more detailed Big 5 factors
• Impulsivity (e.g. Cognitive Reflective Test)
It may also be that Impulsivity plays a part in 
responses to social bots, so perhaps the 
Cognitive Reflective Test would reveal more.

Slide 150 
Future Research Opportunities
• Likely focus on more detailed Big 5 factors
• Cognitive Reflective Test (or other measures 
of impulsivity)
• Target-centric approach. 
And finally, perhaps focus on target-centric 
approach. i.e. bots need to engage the target 
on a topic the target is interested in. Bot needs 
to “fit in” to the group. 
Slide 151 
It’s not all bad though…Intelligent Agents can 
be used for positive actions two.  For example, 
a popular dating site, besieged with dating 
bots, deployed its own bots and now has a 
subsection of its site where bots flirt with other 
bots. 
“So how should we handle bots? OKCupid is a 
dating website that does a great job of this. For 
obvious reasons a dating website is an ideal 
place for spammers, but deleting fake accounts 
only trains them and they quickly come back 
stronger. To tackle this, OKCupid actually 
created their own bots and put them in a 
‘secondary world’. Instead of deleting other 
bots, they move them into this world where 
the bots start having conversations with each 
other – albeit rather strange ones.” 
Source: http://oursocialtimes.com/7-of-twitter-
users-are-not-human/  (Talk from Lutz Finger) 
http://lutzfinger.com/  
Then more recently in the New York Times. 
This.. 
“Dating sites provide especially fertile ground 
for social bots. Swindlers routinely seek to 
dupe lonely people into sending money to 
fictitious suitors or to lure viewers toward pay-
for-service pornography pages. Christian 
Rudder, a co-founder and general manager of 
OkCupid, said that when his dating site recently 
bought and redesigned a smaller site, they 
witnessed not just a sharp decline in bots, but 
also a sudden 15 percent drop in use of the 
new site by real people. This decrease in traffic 
occurred, he maintains, because the flirtatious 
messages and automated “likes” that bots had 
been posting to members’ pages had imbued 
the former site with a false sense of intimacy 
and activity. “Love was in the air,” Mr. Rudder 
said. “Robot love.” 
Mr. Rudder added that his programmers are 
seeking to design their own bots that will flirt 
with invader bots, courting them into a special 
room, “a purgatory of sorts,” to talk to one 
another rather than fooling the humans”

“Illustrations from the Turing Test and 
Blade Runner suggest that sufficient 
interactivity with a computer should reveal 
that it is not human.”
Temmingh & Geer’s 2009 
It’s fitting that we end with Temmingh & Geer’s 
2009 paper for the current best defenses for 
users… 
“For the foreseeable future, individual Web 
users must improve their own ability to 
evaluate threats emanating from cyberspace 
[9]. In most cases, the key is credibility. 
Illustrations from the Turing Test and Blade 
Runner suggest that sufficient interactivity with 
a computer should reveal that it is not human.”
