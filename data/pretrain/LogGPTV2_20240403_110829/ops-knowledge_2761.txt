User: I update the kernel, after that the Ubuntu doesn't work well, PS: I try to exec "meld" command, it will report that "/usr/bin/env: python: No such file or directory", 
then I exec "sudo apt-get install python" and get the result "python is already the newest version.", what should I do for it.

I'm not good at linux, can you tell me how to revert my linux to the last right status, or reinstall the python normally.
Assistant: @mchid's answer is the one you should go for it.
just FYI,
if you do this:
$ python
it will say Command 'python' not found ...
But if you do this:
$ python3, it should work.
So, just modify the shebang line
from !#/usr/bin/env python
to !#/usr/bin/env python3, you're good to go.
(which is automatically done by doing
sudo apt install python-is-python3)
