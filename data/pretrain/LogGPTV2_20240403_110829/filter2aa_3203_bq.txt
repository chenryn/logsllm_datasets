### Chapter 11 – NetBIOS over TCP/IP

**Key Information:**
- **NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)** is a standard Application Programming Interface (API) at the Session layer, allowing user applications to utilize the services of installed network protocol stacks. It also includes a session management and data transport protocol.
- A **NetBIOS name** is a 16-byte identifier for a unique or group NetBIOS application on a network.
- **NetBIOS name management** involves processes for name registration, resolution, and release.
- **NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP)** provides session, name management, and datagram services for NetBIOS applications on an IPv4 network. It is required for computers running Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2003 when using NetBIOS applications.
- **NetBT in Windows** can use various methods to resolve NetBIOS names, including the NetBIOS name cache, NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS), broadcasts, Lmhosts file, local host name, DNS client resolver cache, and DNS servers.
- **NetBT** uses either the Microsoft enhanced B-node (if no WINS servers are configured) or the H-node (if at least one WINS server is configured).
- The **Lmhosts file** is a static text file containing NetBIOS names and IPv4 addresses used by NetBT to resolve names for remote NetBIOS applications.
- The **Nbtstat tool** is the primary tool for collecting NetBT information during troubleshooting.

### Chapter Glossary
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: A hierarchical, distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses and other types of data, enabling users to specify computers and services by friendly names.
- **DNS client resolver cache**: A RAM-based table containing entries from the Hosts file and recent DNS query results.
- **DNS server**: A server that maintains a database of mappings of domain names to IP addresses and other data.
- **Host name**: The name of a computer or device on a network, which must be known by a DNS server or appear in the Hosts file for another computer to find it.
- **Host name resolution**: The process of resolving a host name to an IP address.
- **Hosts file**: A local text file mapping host names to IP addresses, stored in the `systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc` folder.
- **Lmhosts file**: A local text file mapping NetBIOS names to IP addresses for hosts on remote subnets, stored in the `systemroot\System32\Drivers\Etc` folder.
- **NBNS (NetBIOS Name Server)**: A server that stores NetBIOS name-to-IP address mappings and resolves NetBIOS names for NetBIOS-enabled hosts.
- **NetBIOS name**: A 16-byte name for an application using NetBIOS.
- **NetBIOS name cache**: A dynamically maintained table storing recently resolved NetBIOS names and their associated IPv4 addresses.
- **NetBIOS name resolution**: The process of resolving a NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address.
- **NetBIOS node type**: A designation of how NetBIOS nodes resolve NetBIOS names.
- **NetBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP)**: The implementation of the NetBIOS session protocol over TCP/IP (IPv4 only), providing name registration, session establishment, and data transfer services.
- **WINS (Windows Internet Name Service)**: The Microsoft implementation of an NBNS, providing NetBIOS name resolution in routed TCP/IP networks.

### Chapter 12 – Windows Internet Name Service Overview

**Abstract:**
This chapter covers the use of Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) in Microsoft Windows operating systems for NetBIOS name resolution on a TCP/IP network. Network administrators need to understand the role and configuration of WINS clients, WINS servers, and WINS proxies to deploy and troubleshoot NetBIOS name resolution.

**Chapter Objectives:**
- Describe the function of WINS.
- Explain how WINS clients perform name registration, renewal, refresh, and resolution.
- Configure a WINS client to use primary and secondary WINS servers.
- Install and configure a WINS server for static mappings and database replication.
- Describe the function and configuration of a WINS proxy.

**Introduction to WINS:**
- **WINS** is the Windows implementation of a NetBIOS name server (NBNS), providing a distributed database for dynamic mappings of NetBIOS names to IPv4 addresses.
- **WINS** reduces broadcast traffic and eliminates the need for Lmhosts files by allowing direct queries to the WINS server.
- **WINS** supports computer browsing across subnets and domains, enhancing network visibility.

**How WINS Works:**
- **Name Registration**: WINS clients register their NetBIOS names and IP addresses with a WINS server upon initialization.
- **Name Renewal**: WINS clients renew their registrations periodically to maintain ownership of their NetBIOS names.
- **Name Resolution**: WINS clients query the WINS server for NetBIOS name-to-IP address mappings.
- **Name Release**: WINS clients notify the WINS server when they no longer need a NetBIOS name.

**WINS Client Configuration:**
- **Automatic Configuration**: Using DHCP and DHCP options.
- **Manual Configuration**: Using the Netsh tool or Network Connections properties.
- **PPP Connections**: Automatic configuration for Point-to-Point Protocol connections.

**Determining WINS Server Assignments:**
- Use the `ipconfig /all` command.
- Use the `netsh interface ip show wins` command.
- Check the connection status in Network Connections.

**DHCP Configuration of a WINS Client:**
- Configure the WINS/NBNS Servers DHCP option (option 44) on the DHCP server.
- Manually configured WINS settings in the TCP/IPv4 component override DHCP-based settings.

**Manual Configuration of the WINS Client:**
- Obtain properties of the TCP/IPv4 or TCP/IP component for your LAN connection.
- Manually enter the IPv4 addresses of WINS servers.
