Bug
**What is the current behavior?**  
When you have an unexpected prop in a component but that prop is not meant to
be generated on the HTML DOM so that is set to {null}, React triggers this
warning:
    Warning: Unknown prop `activeClassName` on  tag. Remove this prop from the element. For details, see https://fb.me/react-unknown-prop
        in h1 (created by HelloWorldComponent)
        in HelloWorldComponent
The actual use case is to have a reusable component called `` and it'd
be either `` or ``. Here's our actual code.  
In the HTML output, there's no any activeClassName attribute for the second
case, so there shouldn't be any react warning.
**Example reproducing it**  
I've reproduced the issue in a simple example here:

**What is the expected behavior?**  
Don't warn when a prop is defined to {null} and, therefore, never generated in
the DOM.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**  
React version: 15.3.0  
OS: Ubuntu and Mac OS X. Chromium and Google Chrome.
