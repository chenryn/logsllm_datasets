User: I am implementing a filesystem using Python Fuse.  A directory contains only symlinks and as such I return S_IFLNK | 0777 on the getattr method.
Now, when I do an ls on the directory, I notice that Linux calls readlink method 6 times in a row for each entry in the directory.
Is it a bug on my side or a normal behavior?
Assistant: Did you set st_size properly in getattr?  ls will first try with a buffer size of the returned st_size and double it until the the readlink buffer fits.
