User:  We need to upgrade an application running with Docker containers. Please provide the upgrade steps and precautions.
Assistant: Upgrade steps: 1. Backup data, including Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml and data in the data volume. 2. Modify the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files as needed, such as updating the base image, replacing the package, etc. 3. Rebuild the Docker image. 4. Stop the current Docker container. 5. Restart the Docker container according to docker-compose.yml. 6. Check if the app is working properly. Notes: 1. It is very important to back up the application and data before upgrading. Avoid accidental data loss during the upgrade process. 2. When modifying the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files, be careful to ensure correctness and consistency. 3. When rebuilding the Docker image, the image cache needs to be handled carefully to avoid unexpected errors. 4. When stopping the current Docker container, it is necessary to ensure that all requests and processing have been completed to avoid unprocessed requests. 5. When restarting Docker containers, you need to ensure that they are started in the correct order to avoid dependency issues. 6. When checking whether the application program is working properly, it is necessary to check carefully to ensure that there is no problem with the program.
