User:  company has multiple applications deployed on different servers and needs to implement communication between the applications. Please provide a reasonable application communication scheme.
Assistant: reasonable application communication scheme is to use message queues for communication. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Build a message queue server, such as using RabbitMQ or Kafka. 2. Introduce the corresponding message queue client library in each application, such as using RabbitMQ's Java client or Kafka's Python client, etc. 3. Encapsulate the data that needs to be communicated into a message, and send it to the corresponding queue through the message queue. 4. Other applications can receive messages by subscribing to the corresponding message queue to complete the communication process. Advantages: 1. The message queue-based communication method is loosely coupled, does not require direct API calls, and avoids the coupling relationship of direct calls. 2. It can effectively support asynchronous communication, and when a certain application needs to process slowly, it will not affect the normal operation of other applications. 3. The message queue provides high-reliability mechanisms such as message persistence to ensure that messages are not lost and the reliability of communication is guaranteed.
