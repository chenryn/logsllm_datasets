# Route Flap Damping Analysis and Recommendations

## Introduction
Route Flap Damping (RFD) is a mechanism designed to reduce the churn in BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) updates. This analysis aims to evaluate the effectiveness of RFD at different suppress threshold values and provide recommendations for network operators.

## Churn Reduction with Varying Suppress Thresholds
Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the impact of varying the suppress threshold on BGP churn. 

- **Figure 7** shows that a suppress threshold of 4,000 (and above) already damps many fewer prefixes.
- **Figure 8** indicates that a threshold of 6,000 enables an average churn reduction of 19%.

Increasing the suppress threshold value above the current default will increase the BGP churn rate, but it will still result in less churn compared to a router with RFD turned off. The x-axis in Figure 8 represents the candidate value of the suppress threshold, while the y-axis shows the update rate on a per-minute average in 60-minute bins. A 100% churn rate corresponds to the scenario where RFD is disabled.

### Estimating Churn Changes
To estimate how churn could change with different RFD thresholds, we faced two main challenges:
1. **Timestamp Accuracy**: We recorded incoming updates via `tcpdump` with sub-second accuracy, but the router provided less frequent snapshots of penalty values, leading to an estimation of the penalty.
2. **Single Router Analysis**: Our study focused on a single router, not considering complex topologies and interactions.

Despite these limitations, we tagged all updates that crossed our 2K, 3K, ..., thresholds within a certain time window. We observed a 47% reduction in the average update rate with a penalty of 2,000, compared to a situation without RFD. Thresholds of 4,000, 5,000, and 6,000 corresponded to an average update rate reduction between 26% and 19%. Thus, changing the default suppress threshold value is beneficial.

## Heavy Hitters Analysis
For thresholds above 12K, the churn reduction was similar. Specifically:
- Damping thresholds of 12K, 15K, and 18K suppressed an average of 11.26%, 9.51%, and 8.12% of the updates, respectively.
- Among the 64 prefixes with a damped duration of six hours or longer, 53 (83%) passed the high point of 18K, nine (14%) stayed in the 12K-15K range, and only two (3%) went over 15K but not up to 18K.

This suggests that heavy hitters, which constantly flap, will be caught by almost any threshold setting from 12K to 18K. For more conservative operators, we recommend a suppress threshold of 12K and above.

## Additional Feeds and Topology Considerations
To determine if our observations and recommendations hold for other locations in the Internet topology, we replayed additional varied BGP traces from Route Views into the router. The results, shown in Figure 9, indicate that the distributions of penalty values are similar across different feeds, suggesting that our damping suppression threshold recommendation remains valid for BGP feeds from varying points in the Internet topology.

## Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that adjusting RFD parameters can achieve moderate churn reduction without adversely impacting normally converging prefixes. We recommend dampening a route when it reaches a penalty above 12,000, with the suppress threshold set between 12,000 and 18,000. For operators extremely concerned about churn, a suppress threshold of 4,000 to 6,000 is a better compromise than the current default parameters. We do not recommend changing the maximum suppress time but strongly suggest raising the maximum suppress threshold limit.
