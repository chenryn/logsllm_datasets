### Ensuring Adversary Compliance with Ratio Metric Deviations

To ensure that the deviation in the ratio metric never exceeds a threshold \(\epsilon\) in any time window, an adversary must possess four key pieces of information:
1. **Closed-Form Expressions for Harmonic Means (HM):** The exact closed-form expressions for harmonic means do not exist and remain an open problem in real analysis.
2. **Exact (Non-Attacked) Harmonic and Arithmetic Means (AM) on Each Time Slot:** This knowledge is crucial but challenging to obtain at runtime unless the adversary compromises 100% of the meters.
3. **\(\epsilon\) Value:** Different microgrids have different \(\epsilon\) values, and the attacker needs to know the specific \(\epsilon\) for each microgrid. This value can be obtained by compromising a utility insider or accessing a database storing all \(\epsilon\) values, both of which increase the attack cost.
4. **Skewness of Data Distribution:** The skewness is publicly known (right-skewed) and does not add to the attack cost.

### Challenges in Obtaining Required Knowledge

- **Harmonic Mean (HM) and Arithmetic Mean (AM):** These means do not follow a stable historical trend or time series, making it difficult for the adversary to predict them reliably. Without this exact knowledge, the adversary cannot ensure that the resultant \(Q_{r_{av}}(F)\) from the attack will have a ratio deviation less than \(\epsilon\).
- **Approximations of HM:** While several approximations exist, they do not guarantee success every time. The defender only needs to detect the anomaly once to raise an alarm.
- **Visual Evidence of Attacks:** Even if the adversary somehow knows everything, the signatures of attacks are visually evident for \(\delta_{av}\) values as low as 50W (see Appendix C).

### Sensitivity and Detection Rates

- **Sensitivity to Compromised Meters:** The sensitivity to successfully identifying compromised meters differs from detecting the presence of orchestrated attacks. For our model, if the attackerâ€™s \(\delta_{av} < 300W\), the missed detection rate increases to 52%, as such \(\delta_{av}\) is much lower than the standard deviation, leading to higher rating levels.
- **Undetected Compromised Meters:** To keep at least 50% of compromised meters undetected, the highest possible \(\delta_{av} = 300W\) when \(\rho_{mal} = 40%\). However, at such low \(\delta_{av}\), the impact per unit time is minimal (see Appendix D).

### Experimental Results

#### Data Sets and Microgrid Sizes
- **Data Sources:** Data sets from 200, 700, and 5000 houses were obtained from the PecanStreet Project and the Irish Social Science Data Archives, containing hourly power consumption data from Texas, Austin, and Dublin, Ireland, respectively.
- **Microgrid Sizes:** Different microgrid sizes mimic decentralized and centralized deployments of defense frameworks.

#### Anomaly Detection and Trust Model
- **Anomaly Detection:** We studied the results of anomaly detection and trust models for various types of data falsification. A period of no attacks was followed by a period of attacks.
- **Deductive Attack Results:** Deductive attacks have lower \(\delta_{av}\) values because realistic power consumption values are lower-bounded by zero.
- **Visualization:** Anomaly detection results are shown using cumulative moving averages over a 7-day time frame. Compromised meters are assigned lower meter IDs for clarity.

#### Performance Over \(\rho_{mal}\) and \(\delta_{av}\)
- **Comparison with Existing Work:** We show performance over all values of \(\rho_{mal}\) and \(\delta_{av}\) and compare with existing work.

### Choice of \(\epsilon\) for Consensus Correction

- **Impact of \(\epsilon\):** The choice of \(\epsilon\) determines whether the anomaly detection raises an alarm and whether consensus correction is invoked, affecting classification error rates.
- **Optimal \(\epsilon\):** Smaller \(\rho_{mal}\) and \(\delta_{av}\) pairs cause smaller drops/changes in ratios, requiring a smaller \(\epsilon\) to capture them. However, very low \(\epsilon\) values can lead to unwarranted consensus corrections, increasing classification errors. Conversely, a too large \(\epsilon\) will fail to raise alarms for many \(\rho_{mal}\) and \(\delta_{av}\) pairs, leading to biased consensus and increased error rates.
- **Recommended \(\epsilon\):** From computational studies, we observed that the optimal \(\epsilon\) is between \(1.5\sigma_{r_{at_{io}}}\) and \(2\sigma_{r_{at_{io}}}\) of the ratio sample distribution, depending on \(\rho_{mal}\). We used \(\epsilon = 2\sigma_{r_{at_{io}}}\) for all performance results.

### Inferring Presence and Type of Falsification

- **Directional Changes:** Figure 12(a) shows directional changes in HM and AM and ratio drops to distinguish between legitimate changes and malicious attacks. Legitimate changes in consumption maintain a symmetric growth/decay in HM and AM, while additive attacks cause a slower increase in HM compared to AM, leading to a ratio drop.
- **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:** Figures 12(b) and 13(a) show real-time anomaly detection for deductive and camouflage attacks, respectively.

### Robustness of Anomaly Detection

- **Detection Robustness:** \(Q_{r_{av}}(F)\)-based detection is robust across larger fractions of compromised meters. The drop in \(Q_{r_{av}}(F)\) is larger than the chosen \(\epsilon\) for \(\rho_{mal} < 85%\), ensuring successful anomaly detection even at high fractions of compromised meters.
- **Minimum Ratio:** The minimum ratio is achieved when \(\rho_{mal} \sim 50\%\) for additive and deductive attacks. For camouflage attacks, the ratio always decreases with increasing \(\rho_{mal}\) due to the deductive portion affecting only the HM.
