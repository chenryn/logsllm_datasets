### Installation and Configuration of Reddit Search Applications

To install the required Reddit search applications (Bulk Downloader For Reddit, Reddit Finder, and Downloader For Reddit), follow these steps:

1. **Install Python 3.9 and Required Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo -H python3.9 -m pip install bdfr -I
   sudo -H pip install redditsfinder -I
   ```

2. **Clone and Install DownloaderForReddit:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/Programs
   git clone https://github.com/MalloyDelacroix/DownloaderForReddit.git
   cd DownloaderForReddit
   sudo -H pip install .
   ```

3. **Download Data from Reddit:**
   ```bash
   python3.9 -m bdfr download ~/Documents/Reddit/osint --subreddit osint
   python3.9 -m bdfr download ~/Documents/Reddit/inteltechniques --user inteltechniques --subreddit osint
   ```

   These commands query the Pushshift API to retrieve current and deleted post metadata for the specified user and subreddit. The data is saved in the `~/Documents/Reddit` directory.

### Explanation of Commands

- **Python 3.9 Requirement:**
  The Bulk Downloader For Reddit (BDFR) specifically requires Python 3.9, which is not available in Ubuntu 20.04. Therefore, you need to install Python 3.9 manually. Once Ubuntu 22.04 is released, this requirement will be updated.

- **Data Retrieval:**
  - The first command retrieves up to 1000 posts from the "osint" subreddit and saves them to a text file in the `~/Documents/Reddit` directory.
  - The second command retrieves all posts by the user "inteltechniques" within the "osint" subreddit and saves the data.

### Using Downloader For Reddit

1. **Navigate to the Program Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads/Programs/DownloaderForReddit/
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script:**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. **Add User and Subreddit:**

   - Double-click each entry and change the "Post Limit" to "Max".
