This queries the Pushshift API, which is explained in a later chapter. It presents current and deleted post 
metadata attached to the target username within the Terminal screen. This is good, but we can do better. The 
following command requests even’ post I have made, regardless of deletion, along with any images I uploaded 
with a documentation text file, and saves the data to a folder tided "inteltechniques" within a folder tided "users" 
inside the Documents directory of my VM.
This program specifically requires Python version 3.9, which is not available within Ubuntu 20.04 (but will be 
within the 22.04 released in April 2024). Because of this, you were asked to install Python 3.9 earlier. Once 22.04 
is released, I will modify the scripts to ignore this version of Python. The following two commands download 
data from Reddit. The first retrieves up to 1000 posts within the Subreddit "osint", and saves them to a text file 
within the Documents folder. The second retrieves all posts by the user "inteltechniques" within the Subreddit 
"osint" and saves the data.
I have found Reddit to become a common source for online evidence within my investigations. I will later 
discuss manual and semi-automated ways of locating and documenting data available on Reddit. However, 
automated tools take our efforts to another level and produce impressive results. Let's start with installing the 
required three Reddit search applications (Bulk Downloader For Reddit, Reddit Finder, and Downloader 
For Reddit) with the following steps.

Within the application, the first step is to display your location of interest This can be accomplished by typing 
the address or GPS coordinates in the upper left search field. When you see your target location an ax e sc 
the zoom to an appropriate level, you are ready to start adding layers. By default, you will on y see e sa e 
imagery’ of the location.
Google Maps is an online website that is discussed later. Google Earth Pro is a standalone application that takes 
the Google Maps data to another level. With this application, we have access to many’ mapping tools. These 
tools can import data from spreadsheets and help yrou visualize the content. In order to maintain the scope of 
open source intelligence, I will focus on only’ a few specific tools. First, we need to enter the following commands 
within Terminal to install the software.
Click the "Add User" button in the lower left to add target Reddit user accounts. Click the "Add Subreddit" 
button to add target Subreddits. Double-click each and change the "Post Limit" to "Max". You can now right­
click any entry’ to download the data. Click "Database" and "Database View" to see y’our results. You can export 
any data from this view. This is a very’ robust program which should be explored before using it for an 
investigation.
The menu on the left possesses options for adding new content to this view. The last box in this menu is tided 
"Layers". Inside this menu are several data sets that can be enabled and disabled by’ the checkbox next to each. 
I recommend disabling all layers and then enabling one at a time to analy'ze the data that is added to your map 
view. The following details will explain the layers of interest.
The included script, tided "reddit.sh", automates the processes for all of these applications. Launch "Reddit 
Tool" from your Dock or Applications menu. It provides the following options.

Another Google Earth feature available that is often overlooked is the Historical Imagery option. This can be 
activated by selecting the "clock" icon in die upper menu bar of the application. This will open a slider menu 
dirccdy below the icon. This slider can be moved and die result will be various satellite images of the target 
location taken at different times. Figure 4.15 displays a target area with the Historical Imager}7 option enabled. 
The view has been changed to the satellite image obtained on 05/30/2008. Usually, the quality of the images 
will decline as you navigate further back in time, as seen in Figure 4.16, through a satellite image obtained in 
2000. This can be useful in identifying changes in the target location such as building modifications, additional 
vehicles, and land changes. Drug enforcement agents often use this tool to monitor suspected drug growth at a 
target location.

While the Google Earth program is not updated often, the imagery content within is pulled dirccdy from the 
Google archives. It is vital within our arsenal of tools and 1 find it more pleasant

historic satellite imagery which was unavailable from any other online source.
Screen Capture
Kazam
82 Chapter 4
You now possess a high-resolution video of your entire session. This can be very beneficial in many scenarios. 
I have used this to document a specific portion of my investigation when a simple still capture would not suffice.
You are a detective investigating a homicide. You find evidence online implicating your suspect. You are on a 
Windows computer, but all of your investigation was conducted within a Linux VM. You launch recording 
software on the Windows computer and record a video of your work. This video was submitted to the defense. 
For a brief moment, the video captured a file on your Windows desktop titled Accounts.xlsx. It is a spreadsheet 
containing all of your covert online accounts, has no connection to the investigation, and was not intended to 
be exposed. The defense makes a motion to analyze this file, as they believe it could be associated with the 
investigation. The judge approves, and you must share all of your covert accounts with the other side. Does this 
sound far-fetched? It happened to a colleague of mine in 2014.
If you are using an external Mac keyboard, the Fl 3 key replicates "PrtSc". Some Windows keyboards may have 
a key labeled Print Scrn, Pmt Scrn, Prt Scrn, Prt Sen, Prt Scr, Prt Sc or Pr Sc. If you simply want a screenshot 
of your Desktop, such as evidence of your output within a Linux application, this is your best option. If you 
need video of your activities, we will need to install a third-party application.
I previously mentioned multiple unique methods of capturing website evidence within your browser. However, 
you may need a more robust solution for capturing your entire screen. This can be approached from two specific 
avenues. First, you could record either a still or video capture of your entire computer from your host. In other 
words, you could use the default capturing software within your Windows or Mac machine to record video or 
save a screenshot of your Linux VM. I do not recommend this. Recording from your host displays evidence of 
your other operating system. While it would likely never be an issue, it exposes you unnecessarily. Consider the 
following.
• 
PrtSc: Save a screenshot of the entire screen to the "Pictures" directory.
• 
Shift + PrtSc: Select and save a screenshot of a specific region to the "Pictures" directory.
• 
Alt + PrtSc: Save a screenshot of the active window to the "Pictures" directory.
• 
Ctrl + PrtSc: Copy the screenshot of the entire screen to the clipboard.
• 
Shift + Ctrl + PrtSc: Select and copy the screenshot of a specific region to the clipboard.
• 
Ctrl + Alt + PrtSc: Copy the screenshot of the current window to the clipboard.
I have become more paranoid of digital mistakes than necessary, but I believe we should never take chances. 
Therefore, I recommend that all of your screen captures be executed within your VM. Fortunately, Linux has 
many options. First, let's consider the default Ubuntu screenshot utilities. The following keyboard keys and key 
combinations create high-resolution exact screenshots of your VM.
Kazam is a minimal tool for screen recording. It also includes screenshot support, but I find the native Ubuntu 
option easier and faster. Kazam is most suitable for getting the task done quickly without providing many 
options. The following steps will install and execute a Kazam capture.
• 
In Terminal, enter sudo apt install -y kazam and strike enter.
• 
Launch Kazam from the Applications menu (make a shortcut if desired).
• 
Click "Capture" within the application.
• 
After the countdown, your entire screen is being captured.
• 
When finished, click the icon in the upper right and choose "Finish Recording".
• 
Choose "Save for later" and click "Continue".
• 
Choose the location for your recording, and click "Save" in the upper right.

We have only scratched the surface of the possibilities within a Linux virtual machine. New OSINT programs 
and scripts emerge weekly. Hopefully, this chapter has given you the foundation required to understand the 
installation and configuration of any future applications. The methods here can be replicated to create your own 
custom Linux build which works best for your investigative needs.
This creates a shortcut in the Applications menu and this software behaves identical to the examples previously 
provided. This is only required if you want to take advantage of the browser plugin for automated entry of 
credentials into websites.
Throughout this chapter, I have explained ways to copy my digital files into your own VM. If you have done 
that, you are likely in good shape. If you are missing any, you will experience problems. If any scripts are not 
present or seem damaged, my advice is to download a fresh copy by repeating the steps previously presented. 
You will then have all of the custom files within the appropriate folders. We will quickly replicate our entire VM 
in the next chapter. As a reminder, all of the commands required to install and configure all applications from 
this chapter are online at https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9/linux.txL This allows for easier copy and 
paste directly into your own VM. This also presents a way for me to provide updates as needed. 1 wall announce 
any changes to the Linux steps on this book's landing page at https://inteltechniques.com/osintbook9. If you 
find an issue which needs updated, please contact us at errors@inteltechniques.com.
The custom tools, scripts, tutorials, and files downloaded from my website are released to you for free. You may 
modify and use the content any way you desire, including unlimited personal and government use, as long as 
you respect the following restrictions.
I previously mentioned KeePassXC in earlier chapters. It is a solid offline password manager which possesses 
an optional browser plugin. If you choose to use this within your VM, you will need to install the software with 
the following command in Terminal.
• 
NonCommercial: You may not use the material for commercial purposes, including training programs.
• 
NonDistribution: You may not distribute the material, including digital, internet, and physical 
distribution.
It could also be used to explain a search technique through video, which can be easily replicated by the person 
receiving a copy. I appreciate the simplicity of this application, and the lack of any branding or logos within the
All of these programs and scripts can be launched from within the Applications menu (nine dots), but I prefer 
to place them within my Dock. I provide more vital customizations in the next chapter, including a single 
command which automatically populates your Dock with every OSINT application explained throughout this 
entire book.

We are not done adding new Linux applications, but I believe we have covered all the basics. Later in the book, 
I present an advanced Linux applications chapter which will dive deeper into automated OS1NT options.
I do not expect everything presented here to work flawlessly for every' reader. 1 wish it were that simple. A ou

have helped members of my online video training.

If you downloaded my scripts and copied them to your VM, they should launch without any further steps. 
However, if you typed your own, they likely do not possess the authority' to execute. If you have ”.sh" scripts in 
your "scripts" folder, the following commands in Terminal will apply the appropriate execution rights to each.
• 
When typing in Terminal, you can hit the tab key and it will suggest all the possib e options t a 
with the string you have typed so far. It will also autocomplete your command if only' one option 
For example, if you are trying to navigate to your Dow'nloads/Programs folder, you cani just: typ 
~/Dow [tab], then "Pro" [tab] to complete the command. Typing cd ~/D [tab] [tab] would bst a o 
starting with D.

"Ctrl" + "C" kills any running process, and typing "Is” displays the directory' contents.,

You can copy and paste to/from Terminal, but only with right-click (not Ctrl + V ).
• 
Keyboard arrow's will move y’ou through a Terminal command, but mouse clicks do not.
• 
You can modify' the size of your Dock icons in Settings > Dock.
After your initial installation of a Linux program, it may not function. This is usually due to a change within the 
online service which is queried. Updating the program will usually resolve any issues, and this is explained in the 
next chapter titled VM Maintenance & Preservation. However, I like to force an update of all Pip programs and 
dependencies after initial installation. This forces each software program to update to the most current version. 
This may' upset some Linux purists. My reason for this is that programs are more likely' to function with current 
versions of dependencies rather than outdated versions. The following command w'ill update everything. Expect 
to see many warnings during this process which can be ignored. These simply' declare that some 
applications prefer older versions of dependencies, but we will force them all to use the latest revisions.

When you insert a USB drive into your host computer, it is immediately read by your primary operating system. 
Your running VM does not see the device. Within the VirtualBox menu, you can choose "Devices", then "USB", 
and try to click on the USB drive, if found. The issue you may face is that your host has the drive locked and 
will not allow the VM to take over. You can usually resolve this by ejecting the USB drive within your host. On 
both Windows and Mac, you should see an eject icon next to the drive or by right-clicking the device. After 
ejecting, attempt to load the USB device again through the VirtualBox menu. This may present another issue. If 
your USB device is formatted specifically for Mac or Windows, it may not be readable by Linux. I suggest 
specifying a USB device solely for use within this VM and formatting it in a way so that it can be read universally 
by any operating system.
This will create a USB drive on which files can be read and written within any file system. You cannot possess 
files larger than 4GB in size, but I have never had an issue with that during investigations. When you insert the 
USB device into your computer, you can choose to allow your primary OS see it, or load it into your VM. I have 
found this method to be much more reliable than transferring large files through the shared folder. You should 
practice both techniques and pursue the most appropriate option for your investigations.
