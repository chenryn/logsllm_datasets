#### Figure 2: Example CI Question Matrix with Information Flows to a Fixed Recipient and Varying Transmission Principles

We calculated the acceptability scores of information flows, grouped by CI parameters or respondent demographics. For instance, we averaged the acceptability scores of all information flows where the recipient was "its manufacturer" and the transmission principle was "if the information is deleted" to quantify the pairwise effects of these two parameters on privacy norms. These pairwise average acceptability scores were then visualized as heatmaps (Figures 3 & 4) to illustrate how individual CI parameters or respondent demographic factors influence the overall alignment of information flows with privacy norms.

To statistically compare the effects of different COPPA provisions (Sections 4.1–4.4), we averaged the acceptability scores of all information flows grouped by transmission principles. One group included the average score given by each of the 195 respondents to information flows with non-null transmission principles, while another group included the average score given by each respondent to information flows with the null transmission principle. We applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to determine the likelihood that these two groups of scores come from the same distribution. We conducted three such tests with different transmission principle groups and set the significance threshold to p = 0.05/3 = 0.016 to account for the Bonferroni multiple-testing correction.

Similarly, we compared the effects of smart device awareness, COPPA familiarity, and demographic factors (Sections 4.5–4.8) by averaging the acceptability scores of all information flows grouped by the respondent category of interest. For example, one group contained the average score given by each respondent who owned a smart device across all answered CI questions, while the second group contained the average score given by each respondent who did not own a smart device. We again used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to find the likelihood that these two groups of scores come from the same distribution. We performed five such tests with groupings based on COPPA familiarity, age, smart device ownership, education, and income, and set the significance threshold to p = 0.05/5 = 0.01 to account for the Bonferroni multiple-testing correction.

#### 4. Results

Overall, surveyed parents view information flows meeting COPPA data collection guidelines as acceptable, while viewing equivalent information flows without COPPA criteria as unacceptable (Figures 3 & 4). This supports the conclusion that COPPA-mandated information handling practices generally align with parents' privacy norms. In this section, we elaborate on this finding and explore additional trends in our survey responses to further compare COPPA to parents' privacy norms regarding children's smart toys.

#### 4.1 COPPA Data Collection Requirements Align with Parents' Privacy Norms

COPPA requirements were incorporated into the survey as information flow transmission principles derived from the FTC’s Six-Step Compliance Plan for COPPA [10] (Section 3.1). The average acceptability scores of information flows explicitly obeying these requirements are mostly non-negative (Figures 3 & 4), indicating that most surveyed parents consider these flows as "completely acceptable" or "somewhat acceptable."

In contrast, the average acceptability scores of information flows with the control null transmission principle are mostly negative (Figures 3 & 4), indicating that most surveyed parents consider these flows without COPPA criteria as "completely unacceptable" or "somewhat unacceptable."

This difference between information flows with no explicit conditions versus flows with COPPA requirements holds regardless of information sender, recipient, attribute, or parents' demographics (apart from a few specific exceptions discussed below). On average, information flows with COPPA-derived transmission principles are 0.73 Likert-scale points more acceptable than their null transmission principle counterparts (p < 0.001).

Our research provides the first quantitative evidence that COPPA guidelines generally match parents' privacy norms for Internet-connected toys. This indicates that regulation can mandate meaningful transmission principles for information flows and supports further creation and fine-tuning of regulation to keep Internet data collection within the bounds of consumer privacy preferences.

#### 4.2 Parents View Data Collection for Contextual Advertising as Unacceptable

Information flows with the transmission principle "if the information is used to serve contextual ads" have negative average acceptability scores across almost all senders, recipients, and attributes (Figure 3). Unlike other information flows with non-null transmission principles, these flows are prohibited by COPPA. The "contextual ads" transmission principle is a "limited exception to COPPA’s verifiable parental consent requirement" as listed in the COPPA Compliance Plan [10]. This exception only applies to the collection of persistent identifiers (such as cookies, usernames, or user IDs) and not to any of the attributes included in our survey. Our respondents generally agree that collecting the attributes on our survey for contextual (targeted) advertising would be unacceptable, providing further support for COPPA's alignment with parents' norms.

This result indicates that the CI survey technique can detect regulatory provisions that reduce alignment with privacy norms, essential for future applications of the method (Section 6.2). It also provides evidence that the mere presence of a transmission principle doesn't necessarily improve the acceptability of information flows.

This result relates to existing work about opinions of data collection for advertising. Zheng et al. [58] interviewed owners of non-toy Internet-connected home devices and found mixed opinions of targeted advertising with data from these devices depending on the perceived benefit to the user. Combined with our results, this suggests that parents do not believe that relaxing COPPA to allow contextual advertising from more types of children’s toy data would have enough benefit to outweigh privacy concerns.

#### 4.3 Parents View Children’s Birthdays as Especially Private

Information flows including the subject and attribute "its owner’s child’s birthday" are an exception to the trend described in Section 4.1. The average acceptability scores of information flows with this attribute and 10 of the 15 COPPA-derived transmission principles are negative (Figure 3). This discrepancy could be attributed to the relatively small number of parents (11 parents or 5.6% of total respondents) who were asked to score flows with this attribute. Parents may also view their children’s birthdays as more personal than the other surveyed attributes or as less necessary for some of the surveyed transmission principles (such as "to maintain or analyze the function of the device"). Follow-up qualitative studies could focus on specific attributes, such as children’s birthdays, to understand parents’ rationales behind corresponding privacy norms.

#### 4.4 Notification & Consent Versus Confidentiality & Security

Our results also provide insights into the relative importance of different sections within COPPA to parents' privacy norms. This could help regulators prioritize certain forms of non-compliant information collection for legal action.

Our COPPA-derived transmission principles can be divided into categories based on their topic and the section of the COPPA Compliance Plan [10] from which they were drawn (Section 3.1). One category consists of transmission principles from the Compliance Plan steps 2–5 regarding notification and consent (Table 1). These transmission principles involve device privacy policies, the collection of verified consent, and the ability to revoke consent or review collected information. Another category consists of transmission principles from the Compliance Plan step 6 regarding information confidentiality and security (Table 1). These transmission principles involve reasonable data protection, confidential and secure storage, and limited information lifetime.

Across all senders, attributes, and recipients, information flows with transmission principles in the notification/consent category have significantly higher acceptability scores than flows with transmission principles in the confidentiality/security category by an average of 0.43 Likert scale points (p < 0.001) (Figure 3). One notable exception to this trend is the transmission principle "if its privacy policy permits it." The acceptability scores for this transmission principle are an average of 0.53 Likert points lower than for others in the notification/consent category (p < 0.001). We suspect this reflects the general distrust of privacy policies evidenced in previous research [50]. Privacy policies are typically dense, lengthy, and difficult to interpret even for experts [42]. It therefore makes sense that parents would not view the disclosure of information collection in privacy policies as acceptable as other notification methods.

The greater acceptability of information flows with notification or consent criteria versus flows with confidentiality or security criteria corroborates previous research using the CI survey method to discover privacy norms of non-toy consumer IoT devices [3]. This provides longitudinal data indicating that users of Internet-connected products continue to prioritize consent over built-in security when reasoning about the appropriateness of information collection practices. This motivates continued work to improve the state of notification and consent mechanisms for Internet data collection. The most prevalent mechanisms, privacy policies and mobile application permissions, are widely understood to be ineffective for informing users or providing meaningful privacy control options [47]. As policies change to nuance the definitions of informed consent to include ideas of intelligibility, transparency, and active opt-in, among others, it is important to continue to study and evaluate consumer’s privacy expectations regarding consent.

#### 4.5 COPPA Compliance and Familiarity Increase Data Collection Acceptability

Information flows with the transmission principle "if it complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule" received a positive average acceptability score of 0.49 across all senders, recipients, and attributes. As expected, flows with this transmission principle were rated as more acceptable by the 67% of respondents familiar with COPPA than by the 33% of respondents unfamiliar with the rule.

Furthermore, respondents who indicated that they were familiar with COPPA rated all information flows 0.75 Likert points more acceptable on average than respondents who were not familiar with the rule (p < 0.001) (Figure 4).

In both cases, stated compliance and/or familiarity with COPPA may increase parents' acceptance of smart toy data collection by reassuring them that their children’s privacy is protected by regulation. However, this may be a false sense of security, as COPPA guidelines are relatively broad and COPPA violations are likely widespread in practice (Section 6.1) [6, 43].

#### 4.6 Younger Parents are More Accepting of Smart Toy Data Collection

Parents younger than 45 gave an average acceptability score of 0.48 to all rated flows, following the trend discussed in Section 4.1 (Figure 4). In comparison, parents 45 years and older gave an average acceptability score of -0.17 to all rated flows. This difference in the acceptability scores of these two groups is significant (p < 0.01). Nevertheless, context still matters, as information flows specifically "to protect a child’s safety" are viewed as generally acceptable to all surveyed parents regardless of age.

Previous work indicates that young American adults are more aware of online privacy risks and more likely to take steps to protect their privacy online than older adults [40]. Future studies could investigate why this awareness of online privacy risks makes younger parents more accepting of smart toy data collection.

#### 4.7 Parents Who Own Smart Devices are More Accepting of Data Collection

Parents who own generic smart devices or children’s smart devices were more accepting of information flows than respondents who do not own these devices on average, but the difference in scores (0.34 Likert scale points) between these two groups is not significant (p = 0.12).

Nevertheless, this difference corroborates previous work using the CI survey method, in which owners of non-toy consumer IoT devices were found to be more accepting of information flows from these devices than non-owners [3]. This difference likely reflects a self-selection bias, in which those more uncomfortable with Internet data collection are less likely to purchase Internet-connected toys or other devices. However, the small effect size in both this study and the previous work may be due to parents purchasing smart toys unaware of their data collection potential [26] or willing to trade-off privacy concerns for other benefits provided by the products [58].

#### 4.8 Education & Income Have Little Effect on Parents’ Smart Toy Privacy Norms

Parents’ education and income did not have significant effects on acceptability scores. Parents earning more than $100,000 per year gave an average acceptability score of 0.46 to all rated flows, not significantly different from the average score of 0.37 from parents earning less (p = 0.77). Similarly, parents with at least some college education gave an average acceptability score of 0.37, not significantly different from the 0.33 average score of parents with a high school diploma or less (p = 0.58). This is perhaps unexpected given previous work indicating that parents with more resources are more likely to engage with children on privacy issues [41] and is a topic for follow-up research.

### 5. Limitations

Our results must be considered in the context of the following limitations.

#### 5.1 Privacy Attitudes Versus Behaviors

Individuals often self-report greater privacy awareness and concerns than reflected in actual privacy-related behaviors [1, 22]. This "privacy paradox" is well-documented and poses a challenge for researchers. The CI survey method is vulnerable to privacy paradox effects. However, there is a reasonable argument that privacy regulation should prioritize the expressed norms of users (measured by the survey instrument) over norms evidenced through behaviors, which are influenced by external factors (such as confusing user interfaces) that could be affected by the regulation. For example, it is often difficult for consumers to determine the data collection practices of IoT devices, including Internet-connected children’s toys, due to poor company disclosure practices [42] and limited auditing by third parties. Just because many parents purchase smart toys does not mean that they approve of the toys’ data collection practices and wouldn’t support new regulation to improve privacy.

#### 5.2 Respondent Representativeness

The self-reported demographics of our respondents (Appendix B) indicate that the sample, while diverse, is non-representative in ways that may influence measured privacy norms. Females and high-income individuals are notably overrepresented in our sample compared to the United States population. The literature on gender differences in online privacy concerns suggests that women may generally perceive more privacy risks online than men [4, 14, 56], but some studies contradict this conclusion, reporting no significant gender effect [55]. The effect of income on online privacy concerns is similarly unsettled, with some reporting that high-income individuals are more concerned about privacy [52, 53], while others find no significant effect [54].
