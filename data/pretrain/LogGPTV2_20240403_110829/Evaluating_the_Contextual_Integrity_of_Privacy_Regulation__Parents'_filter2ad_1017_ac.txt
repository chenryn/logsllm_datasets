ability scores of ﬂows grouped by CI parameters or respon-
dent demographics. For example, we averaged the accept-
ability scores of all information ﬂows with the recipient “its
manufacturer” and the transmission principle “if the infor-
mation is deleted” in order to quantify the pairwise effects
of these two parameters on privacy norms. We then plotted
these pairwise average acceptability scores as heatmaps to
visualize how individual CI parameters or respondent demo-
graphic factors affect the overall alignment of information
ﬂows with privacy norms (Figures 3 & 4).
We statistically compared the effects of different COPPA
provisions (Sections 4.1–4.4) by averaging the acceptabil-
ity scores of all information ﬂows grouped by transmission
principles. For example, one group contained the average
score given by each of the 195 respondents to information
ﬂows with non-null transmission principles, while a second
group contained the average score given by each respondent
to information ﬂows with the null transmission principle. We
then applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to ﬁnd the like-
lihood that these two groups of scores come from the same
distribution. We performed three such tests with different
transmission principle groups and set the threshold for sig-
niﬁcance to p = 0.05/3 = 0.016 to account for the Bonfer-
roni multiple-testing correction.
We statistically compared the effects of smart device
awareness, COPPA familiarity, and demographic factors
(Sections 4.5–4.8) by averaging the acceptability scores of
all information ﬂows grouped by respondent category of in-
terest. For example, one group contained the average score
given by each respondent who owned a smart device across
all answered CI questions, while the second set contained the
average score given by each respondent who did not own a
smart device. We then applied the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
to ﬁnd the likelihood that these two groups of scores come
from the same distribution. We performed ﬁve such tests
with groupings based on COPPA familiarity, age, smart de-
vice ownership, education, and income and set the threshold
for signiﬁcance to p = 0.05/5 = 0.01 to account for the Bon-
ferroni multiple-testing correction.

Overall, surveyed parents view information ﬂows meeting
COPPA data collection guidelines as acceptable while view-
ing equivalent information ﬂows without COPPA criteria as
unacceptable (Figures 3 & 4). This supports the conclusion
that COPPA-mandated information handling practices gen-
erally align with parents’ privacy norms. In this section, we
elaborate on this ﬁnding and explore additional trends in our
survey responses to further compare COPPA to parents’ pri-
vacy norms regarding children’s smart toys.
4.1 COPPA Data Collection Requirements
Align with Parents’ Privacy Norms
COPPA requirements were incorporated in the survey as
information ﬂow transmission principles derived from the
FTC’s Six-Step Compliance Plan for COPPA [10] (Sec-
tion 3.1). The average acceptability scores of information
ﬂows explicitly obeying these requirements are mostly non-
negative (Figures 3 & 4). This indicates that most surveyed
parents consider these ﬂows as “completely acceptable” or
“somewhat acceptable.”
In comparison, the average ac-
ceptability scores of information ﬂows with the control null
transmission principle are mostly negative (Figures 3 & 4),
indicating that most surveyed parents consider these ﬂows
without COPPA criteria as “completely unacceptable” or
“somewhat unacceptable.”
This difference between information ﬂows with no explicit
conditions versus ﬂows with COPPA requirements holds re-
gardless of information sender, recipient, attribute, or par-
ents’ demographics (apart from a few speciﬁc exceptions
which we discuss below). On average, information ﬂows
with COPPA-derived transmission principles are 0.73 Likert-
scale points more acceptable than their null transmission
principle counterparts (p < 0.001).
Our research provides the ﬁrst quantitative evidence that
COPPA guidelines generally match parents’ privacy norms
for Internet-connected toys. This indicates that regulation
can mandate meaningful transmission principles for infor-
mation ﬂows and supports further creation and ﬁne-tuning of
regulation to keep Internet data collection within the bounds
of consumer privacy preferences.
4.2 Parents View Data Collection for
Contextual Advertising as Unacceptable
Information ﬂows with the transmission principle “if the
information is used to serve contextual ads” have negative
average acceptability scores across almost all senders, recip-
ients, and attributes (Figure 3). Unlike all other informa-
tion ﬂows on our survey with non-null transmission prin-
ciples, these ﬂows are actually prohibited by COPPA. The
“contextual ads” transmission principle is a “limited excep-
tion to COPPA’s veriﬁable parental consent requirement” as
listed in the COPPA Compliance Plan [10]. This exception
only applies to the collection of persistent identiﬁers (such
as cookies, usernames, or user IDs) and not to any of the at-
tributes included on our survey. Our respondents generally
agree that collecting the attributes on our survey for contex-
tual (targeted) advertising would be unacceptable, providing
further support for COPPA’s alignment with parents’ norms.
This result indicates that the CI survey technique can de-
tect regulatory provisions that reduce alignment with privacy
norms, essential for future applications of the method (Sec-
tion 6.2). It also provides evidence that the mere presence
of a transmission principle doesn’t necessarily improve the
acceptability of information ﬂows.
This result relates to existing work about opinions of data
collection for advertising. Zheng et al. [58] interviewed own-
ers of non-toy Internet-connected home devices and found
mixed opinions of targeted advertising with data from these
devices depending on the perceived beneﬁt to the user. Com-
bined with our results, this suggests that parents do not be-
lieve that relaxing COPPA to allow contextual advertising
from more types of children’s toy data would have enough
beneﬁt to outweigh privacy concerns.
4.3 Parents View Children’s Birthdays as
Especially Private
Information ﬂows including the subject and attribute “its
owner’s child’s birthday” are an exception to the trend de-
scribed in Section 4.1. The average acceptability scores
of information ﬂows with this attribute and 10 of the 15
COPPA-derived transmission principles are negative (Fig-
ure 3). This discrepancy could be attributed to the relatively
small number of parents (11 parents or 5.6% of total respon-
dents) who were asked to score ﬂows with this attribute. Par-
ents may also view their children’s birthdays as more per-
sonal than the other surveyed attributes or as less necessary
for some of the surveyed transmission principles (such as “to
maintain or analyze the function of the device”). Follow-up
qualitative studies could focus on speciﬁc attributes, such as
children’s birthdays, to understand parents’ rationales behind
corresponding privacy norms.
4.4 Notiﬁcation & Consent Versus
Conﬁdentiality & Security
Our results also provide insights into the relative impor-
tance of different sections within COPPA to parents’ privacy
norms. This could help regulators prioritize certain forms of
non-compliant information collection for legal action.
Our COPPA-derived transmission principles can be di-
vided into categories based on their topic and the section
of the COPPA Compliance Plan [10] from which they were
drawn (Section 3.1). One category consists of transmission
principles from the Compliance Plan steps 2–5 regarding no-
tiﬁcation and consent (Table 1). These transmission princi-
132    28th USENIX Security Symposium
USENIX Association
ples involve device privacy policies, the collection of veriﬁed
consent, and the ability to revoke consent or review collected
information. Another category consists of transmission prin-
ciples from the Compliance Plan step 6 regarding informa-
tion conﬁdentiality and security (Table 1). These transmis-
sion principles involve reasonable data protection, conﬁden-
tial and secure storage, and limited information lifetime.
Across all senders, attributes, and recipients, informa-
tion ﬂows with transmission principles in the notiﬁca-
tion/consent category have signiﬁcantly higher acceptability
scores than ﬂows with transmission principles in the con-
ﬁdentiality/security category by an average of 0.43 Likert
scale points (p < 0.001) (Figure 3). One notable exception
to this trend is the transmission principle “if its privacy pol-
icy permits it.” The acceptability scores for this transmission
principle are an average of 0.53 Likert points lower than for
others in the notiﬁcation/consent category (p < 0.001). We
suspect this reﬂects the general distrust of privacy policies
evidenced in previous research [50]. Privacy policies are
typically dense, lengthy, and difﬁcult to interpret even for
experts [42]. It therefore makes sense that parents would not
view the disclosure of information collection in privacy poli-
cies as acceptable as other notiﬁcation methods.
The greater acceptability of information ﬂows with noti-
ﬁcation or consent criteria versus ﬂows with conﬁdential-
ity or security criteria corroborates previous research using
the CI survey method to discover privacy norms of non-
toy consumer IoT devices [3]. This provides longitudinal
data indicating that users of Internet-connected products con-
tinue to prioritize consent over built-in security when reason-
ing about the appropriateness of information collection prac-
tices. This motivates continued work to improve the state of
notiﬁcation and consent mechanisms for Internet data collec-
tion. The most prevalent mechanisms, privacy policies and
mobile application permissions, are widely understood to be
ineffective for informing users or providing meaningful pri-
vacy control options [47]. As policies change to nuance the
deﬁnitions of informed consent to include ideas of intelligi-
bility, transparency and active opt-in, among others, it is im-
portant to continue to study and evaluate consumer’s privacy
expectations regarding consent.
4.5 COPPA Compliance and Familiarity
Increase Data Collection Acceptability
Information ﬂows with the transmission principle “if it
complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection
Rule” received a positive average acceptability score of 0.49
across all senders, recipients, and attributes. As expected,
ﬂows with this transmission principle were rated as more ac-
ceptable by the 67% of respondents familiar with COPPA
than by the 33% of respondents unfamiliar with the rule.
Furthermore, respondents who indicated that they were
familiar with COPPA rated all information ﬂows 0.75 Lik-
ert points more acceptable on average than respondents who
were not familiar with the rule (p < 0.001) (Figure 4).
In both cases, stated compliance and/or familiarity with
COPPA may increase parents’ acceptance of smart toy data
collection by reassuring them that their children’s privacy is
protected by regulation. However, this may be a false sense
of security, as COPPA guidelines are relatively broad and
COPPA violations are likely widespread in practice (Sec-
tion 6.1) [6, 43].
4.6 Younger Parents are More Accepting of
Smart Toy Data Collection
Parents younger than 45 gave an average acceptability
score of 0.48 to all rated ﬂows, following the trend discussed
in Section 4.1 (Figure 4). In comparison, parents 45 years
and older gave an average acceptability score of −0.17 to
all rated ﬂows. This difference in the acceptability scores of
these two groups is signiﬁcant (p < 0.01). Nevertheless, con-
text still matters, as information ﬂows speciﬁcally “to protect
a child’s safety” are viewed as generally acceptable to all sur-
veyed parents regardless of age.
Previous work indicates that young American adults are
more aware of online privacy risks and more likely to take
steps to protect their privacy online than older adults [40].
Future studies could investigate why this awareness of online
privacy risks makes younger parents more accepting of smart
toy data collection.
4.7 Parents Who Own Smart Devices are
More Accepting of Data Collection
Parents who own generic smart devices or children’s smart
devices were more accepting of information ﬂows than re-
spondents who do not own these devices on average, but the
difference in scores (0.34 Likert scale points) between these
two groups is not signiﬁcant (p = 0.12).
Nevertheless, this difference corroborates previous work
using the CI survey method, in which owners of non-toy
consumer IoT devices were found to be more accepting of
information ﬂows from these devices than non-owners [3].
This difference likely reﬂects a self-selection bias, in which
those more uncomfortable with Internet data collection are
less likely to purchase Internet-connected toys or other de-
vices. However, the small effect size in both this study and
the previous work may be due to parents purchasing smart
toys unaware of their data collection potential [26] or will-
ing to trade-off privacy concerns for other beneﬁts provided
by the products [58].
4.8 Education & Income have Little Effect on
Parents’ Smart Toy Privacy Norms
Parents’ education and income did not have signiﬁcant
effects on acceptability scores. Parents earning more than
USENIX Association
28th USENIX Security Symposium    133
$100,000 per year gave an average acceptability score of
0.46 to all rated ﬂows, not signiﬁcantly different from the
average score of 0.37 from parents earning less (p = 0.77).
Similarly, parents with at least some college education gave
an average acceptability score of 0.37, not signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from the 0.33 average score of parents with a high
school diploma or less (p = 0.58). This is perhaps unex-
pected given previous work indicating that parents with more
resources are more likely to engage with children on privacy
issues [41] and is a topic for follow-up research.
5 Limitations
Our results must be considered in the context of the follow-
ing limitations.
5.1 Privacy Attitudes Versus Behaviors
Individuals often self-report greater privacy awareness
and concerns than reﬂected in actual privacy-related behav-
iors [1, 22]. This “privacy paradox” is well-documented and
poses a challenge for researchers. The CI survey method
is vulnerable to privacy paradox effects. However, there is
a reasonable argument that privacy regulation should prior-
itize the expressed norms of users (measured by the survey
instrument) over norms evidenced through behaviors, which
are inﬂuenced by external factors (such as confusing user
interfaces) that could be affected by the regulation. For ex-
ample, it is often difﬁcult for consumers to determine the
data collection practices of IoT devices, including Internet-
connected children’s toys, due to poor company disclosure
practices [42] and limited auditing by third parties.
Just
because many parents purchase smart toys does not mean
that they approve of the toys’ data collection practices and
wouldn’t support new regulation to improve privacy.
5.2 Respondent Representativeness
The self-reported demographics of our respondents (Ap-
pendix B) indicate that the sample, while diverse, is non-
representative in ways that may inﬂuence measured privacy
norms.
Females and high-income individuals are notably overrep-
resented in our sample compared to the United States popu-
lation. The literature on gender differences in online privacy
concerns suggests that women may generally perceive more
privacy risks online than men [4, 14, 56], but some studies
contradict this conclusion, reporting no signiﬁcant gender ef-
fect [55]. The effect of income on online privacy concerns
is similarly unsettled, with some reporting that high-income
