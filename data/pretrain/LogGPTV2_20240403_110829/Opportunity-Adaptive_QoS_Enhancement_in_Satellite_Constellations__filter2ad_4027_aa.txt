Abstract
Systems that are formed by massively distributed mo-
bile resources, such as satellite constellations, often pro-
vide mission-critical functions. However, many existing
quality-of-service (QoS) management concepts cannot be
applied to those systems in a traditional way, due to the
continuously changing readiness-to-serve of their mobile
resources.
In this paper, we describe a case study that
investigates a method called “opportunity-adaptive QoS
enhancement (OAQ).” Driven by an application-oriented
QoS objective, the method focuses on a solution that per-
mits a structurally degraded constellation to deliver signal-
position-determination (geolocation) results with the best
possible quality. More speciﬁcally, the OAQ algorithm en-
ables iterative geolocation accuracy improvement by let-
ting neighboring satellites coordinate, and by progressively
expanding the scale of this coordination in the window of
a dynamically determined opportunity. For effectiveness
demonstration, we deﬁne a QoS measure and solve it an-
alytically. The results show that the OAQ approach signif-
icantly enhances a constellation’s ability to deliver service
with the quality at the high end of a QoS spectrum, even in
presence of structural degradation.

Introduction
As micro-electro-mechanical systems and wireless net-
working technologies advance, it is anticipated that many
critical applications will rely on a class of systems that
are composed of massively distributed mobile resources.
Examples of such systems include micro-UAV (unmanned
aerial vehicle) swarms that perform coordinated actions in
hazardous environments for damage control or monitor-
ing, and micro-satellite constellations in which hundreds
of nodes coordinate for formation ﬂying, surveillance, and
communication. While their quality of service (QoS) is usu-
ally mission-critical, they are often vulnerable to failures
caused by adverse space-environment conditions, physical
or other types of inadvertent faults, and malicious attacks.
In addition, due to their mobile nature, the readiness-to-
serve [1] of individual computing resources in those sys-
tems changes dynamically and continuously, making tradi-
tional redundancy-based fault tolerance schemes and QoS
management concepts difﬁcult to apply.
In spite of their importance, fault tolerance and QoS
management for systems built on massively distributed mo-
bile resources have not yet received enough attention. To
the best of our knowledge, aside from the efforts concern-
ing reliable inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite commu-
nications (see [2, 3], for example), no signiﬁcant work
has been devoted to method development for mitigating
the effects on application-oriented QoS of satellite-failure-
caused, constellation-structure degradation.
With the above motivation, we carry out a case study
to investigate a framework that allows us to exploit mo-
bile resource redundancy to mitigate the effects of a con-
stellation’s structural degradation on geolocation accuracy
(i.e., the accuracy of locating a signal-emitter on the earth).
Accordingly, our QoS objective is to guarantee the timely
delivery of geolocation results with the best possible accu-
racy. As this QoS objective necessitates a cohesive formu-
lation of fault-tolerant satellite constellation operation, our
method derivation is based on the integration of concepts
and techniques across the areas of satellite constellation and
fault-tolerant computing. Speciﬁcally, it has been shown
in the satellite research literature that sensor measurements
accumulated by neighboring satellites that successively ﬂy
over a signal emitter can support an iterative weighted least-
square algorithm and thereby enable a mechanism called
sequential localization to reduce errors in signal-position
determination [4, 5]. Although the original purpose of
this mechanism was to circumvent the difﬁculties caused
by satellite capacity inadequacy (e.g., an insufﬁcient num-
ber of onboard sensors) or noisy space environments, the
synergy between the theoretical basis of sequential local-
ization and the concepts of data diversity [6] and environ-
ment diversity [7] associated with fault-tolerant computing
suggests that sequential localization can be judiciously ex-
ploited for tolerating the effects of failure-caused loss of
satellites on geolocation quality. We thereby develop an al-
gorithm which lets two or more surviving satellites that con-

secutively revisit a signal location coordinate for iterative
geolocation-accuracy enhancement, in a situation in which
satellite failures reduce a constellation’s “density” and make
it no longer possible to let multiple satellites simultaneously
“co-visit” the location to ensure result accuracy.
Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of satellite con-
stellations leads us to introduce to the algorithm a concept
called opportunity-adaptive QoS enhancement (OAQ). Ac-
cordingly, the algorithm permits the coordinated, iterative
geolocation-accuracy enhancement to be carried out in an
aggressive fashion, by continuously expanding the scale of
the coordination among peer satellites within a “window of
opportunity.” From temporal perspective, the window of
opportunity is dynamically determined by the alert-message
delivery deadline and signal duration. From spatial per-
spective, the opportunity is characterized by the number of
mobile resources that are able to join the coordinated it-
erative geolocation computation. More speciﬁcally, those
resources include 1) the satellites that happen to be in the
range that allows their footprints1 to cover the signal loca-
tion at the initial detection, and 2) those satellites whose
routine traveling patterns bring their footprints to the target
location subsequent to the initial detection and within the
window of opportunity.
The central purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the OAQ framework. Hence, in addition to
describing the algorithm, we conduct a model-based quan-
titative evaluation to analyze the QoS gain from the use of
the OAQ algorithm. The model is constructed based on
a reference satellite constellation that is designed for de-
tection and position localization of radio-frequency (signal)
emitters [8]. Through analyzing the evaluation results, we
show that the OAQ framework signiﬁcantly enhances the
system’s ability to deliver service with the quality at the
high end of an application-oriented QoS spectrum, even af-
ter a signiﬁcant number of satellites are lost due to faults.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion 2 provides background information. Section 3 de-
scribes the OAQ framework in detail, followed by Section
4 which presents an analytic model and discusses the eval-
uation results. Concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
2 Degradable QoS in Satellite Constellations
Since our objective is to investigate fault tolerance and
QoS issues in the systems that are formed by massively dis-
tributed mobile resources, the types of satellite constella-
tions we are concerned with are LEO (low earth orbit) con-
stellations that comprise a large number of small satellites.
Moreover, we focus on tactical and strategic applications.
Hence, we view accuracy of signal-position determination
as a crucial QoS property of a satellite constellation.
1The area on the earth that is covered by a satellite is referred to as the
footprint of that satellite.
For clarity of illustration, we use the constellation shown
in Figure 1 as the reference constellation. However, the
OAQ framework will also be applicable for other systems
of similar types, and is anticipated to be more effective for
systems built on very large populations of nodes, such as
pico-satellite constellations. As mentioned in Section 1, this
reference constellation is designed for geolocation of radio-
frequency (RF) emitters for surveillance applications.
The constellation is formed by seven orbital planes. (In-
formally speaking, an orbital plane is a ring-shaped trajec-
tory along which satellites travel around the globe.) Each of
the planes consists of 14 micro-satellites that are intended to
be active in service, and two in-orbit spares that can be de-
ployed to replace any failed satellites in the same orbital
plane. Therefore, the constellation consists of 98 active
satellites and 14 in-orbit spares (for a total of 112 satellites).
Figure 1: The Reference RF Geolocation Constellation
Figure 1 shows that when the constellation has 98 opera-
tional satellites, it offers a full earth coverage. Furthermore,
every earth location will be covered by at least one satellite
and a large portion of the globe (especially in the areas of
high latitude) is covered by overlapped footprints. However,
the geometry of the constellation will change if satellites are
lost due to physical failures or malicious attacks. Speciﬁ-
cally, when an orbital plane loses satellites after exhausting
its spares, the surviving satellites will undergo a phasing ad-
justment so that they can be evenly distributed in the plane
again. As a result, the overlapped portion of the footprints
of adjacent satellites will shrink, which makes it less likely
that a target will be captured simultaneously by multiple
satellites. When more satellites fail, the footprints of sur-
viving satellites will eventually become detached (we use
the term “underlapping” to refer to this case in the remain-
der of this paper). Figures 2(a) and 2(b) illustrate the types
of geometric orientation a plane may exhibit. In the ﬁgures

solid dots represent the satellites traveling in that plane; the
shaded ovals are the satellites’ footprints and the cellular
phones emitting RF signals are the assumed targets.

Figure 2: Node-Failure-Caused Structural Degradation
As illustrated in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), we deﬁne revisit
time, Tr[k], as the time interval from the instant the cen-
ter of a satellite’s footprint passes a location on the earth
to the instant the center of the footprint of the next satel-
lite (in the same plane) passes the same location, given that
the plane has k active operational satellites. (Tr[k] can also
be viewed as the distance, measured in time units, between
the two satellites.) Note that K, the number of operational
satellites that are actively in service in an orbital plane, is a
random variable, since satellites in the plane fail over time.
Further, we use the term “coverage time,” denoted by Tc, to
refer to the maximum amount of time that a location on the
earth can be covered by the footprint of a single satellite.
Note that the length of Tc can be “visualized” as the diam-
eter of a footprint, as shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). From
the deﬁnitions of Tr[k] and Tc, it follows that the geomet-
ric orientation of the footprint trajectory of an orbital plane
can be determined by the relations between Tr[k] and Tc.
More precisely, Tr[k] < Tc and Tr[k] ≥ Tc imply footprint
overlapping and underlapping, respectively.
The geometric orientation changes will affect the QoS
of geolocation computation. In particular, when footprints
overlap, it is possible that a target will be covered simul-
taneously by the footprints of adjacent satellites, which we
call simultaneous multiple coverage. When two or more
satellites observe a target at the same time, a measurement
collection that is signiﬁcantly more extensive than that from
a single satellite can be obtained. With the added measure-
ments, the ambiguity problem will practically disappear, re-
sulting in a dramatic improvement of positioning accuracy
[4]. Nonetheless, even when all satellites in the constella-
tion are functioning, it is still possible that a target is cov-
ered by only a single satellite, as the earth is not completely
covered by overlapped footprints.
When a constellation successively experiences structural
degradation due to loss of satellites, footprints will eventu-
ally become underlapping, as shown in Figure 2(b). If that
happens, a target will be covered by a single footprint at a
time at best, thus preventing geolocation results from hav-
ing high accuracy. In the worst case, a target could escape
from surveillance, if 1) the signal starts when its location is
not covered by any footprints, and 2) the signal stops before
the nearest footprint moves to that location.
The above discussion implies that a constellation’s struc-
tural degradation will lead to its QoS degradation. Further-
more, since the readiness-to-serve of each surviving satellite
varies over locations and time, and since signal occurrence
and duration are unpredictable, the extent to which we can
pursue QoS enhancement in a structurally degraded con-
stellation cannot be determined even if the geometric orien-
tation of the constellation is known. In turn, those factors
collectively suggest that an effective solution for QoS opti-
mization should be opportunity-adaptive. Accordingly, we
develop a framework as described in the next section.
3 OAQ Framework
3.1 Overview
It has been shown in the research literature that infor-
mation from diverse sources can help resolve ambiguity in
signal position determination. Those information includes
earlier measurements and previously calculated position co-
ordinates. Further, delayed position determination (termed
as sequential localization) may help reduce errors in cal-
culation because another satellite may appear in the range
in time to cover the target, and additional measurements
can thus be accumulated to support an iterative weighted
least-square algorithm [4, 5]. Although the original pur-
pose of sequential localization was to circumvent the dif-
ﬁculties associated with satellites that are not adequately
equipped (with respect to quantity and capability of sensors)
or to tolerate noisy space environments, the mechanism can
be judiciously exploited for mitigating the effects of a con-
stellation’s structural degradation on geolocation accuracy.
Speciﬁcally, we can let two surviving satellites that con-
secutively revisit the target coordinate for iterative position
determination, in the circumstance where satellite failures
reduce a constellation’s “density” so that footprints become
underlapping.
We can take a similar approach to QoS enhancement in
the situation where the constellation has enough operational
satellites such that an appreciable portion of its earth cover-
age is made up by overlapped footprints. Speciﬁcally, if a
signal is initially detected by a single satellite, we can with-
hold the preliminary result and wait to see whether over-
lapped footprints will arrive at that location before reaching
the deadline for alert-message delivery2. If so, simultaneous
multiple coverage will ensure a high-accuracy geolocation
