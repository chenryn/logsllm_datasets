title:blackhat:eu-19 Unleashing the Power of My 20+ Years Old Car
When I came to Japan about a year and half ago, the first thing I did was buy a car. Coming from a ~70hp family car, I chose to go for something more powerful and bought a 90's sports car. I've been dailying it and tracking it since then (> 50 000km so far) and it has been a great car. However, regulations in Japan require manufacturers to add a speed limiter to their cars, preventing you from going over 180km/h (approximatively). In this talk, I will give a brief introduction on how I managed to bypass that limiter, how I could have done it, how I ended up doing it, and what I discovered along the way.Automotive engine computer management will be introduced, as well as a bit of hardware, software reverse engineering, and video demonstrations.This work was done for educational purposes. Testing has been done legally on racetracks and closed roads only.
