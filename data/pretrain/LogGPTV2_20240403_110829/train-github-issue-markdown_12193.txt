It appears that `react-select` has a few type definition issues. Specifically, the `OptionRendererHandler` and `ValueRendererHandler` types incorrectly specify `option: Option` when they should be using `option: TValue`. Upon debugging the callback, it becomes evident that the raw or original object is passed to these handlers, rather than an object wrapped in an `Option`.

To clarify:
- **Current Issue**: The type definitions for `OptionRendererHandler` and `ValueRendererHandler` use `option: Option`.
- **Expected Behavior**: These handlers should receive `option: TValue`, which represents the raw or original object.

This discrepancy can lead to type mismatches and potential runtime errors. It would be beneficial to update the type definitions to reflect the correct behavior.
