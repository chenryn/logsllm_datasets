  thinking…	
What	
  if	
  this	
  showed	
  up?	
Or	
  if	
  this	
  showed	
  up?	
Now	
  there	
  are	
  LOTS	
  of	
  regulaAons	
governing	
  the	
  ﬂying	
  of	
  Unmanned	
  AircraR	
  Systems.	
Most	
  laws	
  restrict:	
1.  Government/law	
  enforcement’s	
  use	
2.  Commercial	
  use	
  (FAA	
  needs	
  to	
  authorize.)	
Non-­‐commercial,	
  private	
  (hobbyist)	
  use	
largely	
  not	
  regulated	
  YET.	
Some	
  current	
  regulaAons	
  on	
  UAS:	
1.  No	
  ﬂy	
  zones:	
1.  Around	
  Washington,	
  DC	
  (15	
  mi	
  radius)	
2.  Around	
  airports	
  (5	
  mi	
  radius)	
3.  On	
  military	
  bases	
2.  Cannot	
  launch,	
  land,	
  or	
  crash	
  in	
  a	
  naAonal	
  park.	
Technically,	
  air	
  space	
  is	
  not	
  NaAonal	
  Park	
  Service’s	
(NPS)	
  to	
  regulate;	
  however,	
  NPS	
  can	
  get	
  you	
  for	
safety	
  (reckless	
  endangerment)	
  and	
  noise	
  issues.	
3.  Temporary	
  Flight	
  RestricAons	
  within	
  the	
  area	
  of	
  a	
disaster,	
  wildﬁre,	
  stadium/sporAng	
  event,	
  or	
PresidenAal	
  visit.	
4.  Cannot	
  mount	
  a	
  gun	
  on	
  a	
  UAS	
  –	
  it	
  becomes	
  a	
weapon	
  system.

6.  Line

That’s	
  nice	
  and	
  all,	
  but…	
My	
  neighbor’s	
  kid	
  is	
  STILL	
  annoying,	
and	
  I	
  want	
  to	
  know…	
Is	
  there	
  a	
  way	
  to	
  force	
a	
  drone/quadcopter	
  to	
  land?	
Maybe	
  something	
  more	
  subtle?	
Let’s
