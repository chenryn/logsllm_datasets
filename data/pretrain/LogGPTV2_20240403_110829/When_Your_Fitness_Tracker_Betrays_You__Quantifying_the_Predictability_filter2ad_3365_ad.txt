Overall, it is evident that the lower-end phone is a less useful
source of biometric information. This is mainly due to less
precise sensors (i.e., lower sampling rate and resolution),
which particularly affects acceleration features (low touch-
screen sampling rate) and area covered (low resolution).
Conversely, this shows that high-quality sensors can improve
the security of an authentication device.
Mouse movements. Figure 5d reports on average low un-
predictability results for most mouse movements features.
Curvature-based features in particular seem highly pre-
dictable, while not carrying signiﬁcant distinctiveness (they
might be dropped in a security-critical scenario). However,
the plot shows a high mean and standard deviation for
click duration. This is due to the the trackpad API returning
a coarse-grained click information, less sensitive than that
returned by the mouse. Conversely, if source and target were
switched, this feature would be very easy to predict as the
set of valid target values would be small. This example
highlights that more accurate sensors with higher resolution
can thwart attacks coming from lower-quality data sources.

6.4. Population Size Analysis
References
Collecting a large number of (pairs of) biometric sam-
ples to train the cross-context mapping is a considerable
effort. While it is possible to use publicly available datasets
(see Section 3), this data may not always be available for the
victim’s target context (e.g., when the victim uses an unusual
device). As such, it is important to know how large (in terms
of number of users) the population has to be to produce
acceptable results. Figure 6 shows the relationship between
the number of users in the population and the average score
of the resulting cross-context mapping. All biometrics show
an initial sharp drop in the score and exhibit diminishing
returns beyond a population of size of 10. These results
show that most of the cross-context mapping’s predictive
power can be achieved with a relatively small population. In
addition, Figure 6 suggests that the sample size of our study
(30 participants) is large enough to demonstrate differences
between individual features, contexts and biometrics.
7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented an analytical framework
that allows us to measure the unpredictability of biometric
features across different contexts. We deﬁne the notion of
an unpredictability score, which can be calculated both for
individual features and complete biometrics. The score pro-
vides ﬁne-grained information about the resilience of bio-
metric systems against cross-context attacks and can be used
to: (i) compare biometric systems, (ii) identify vulnerable
target contexts and for (iii) the selection and engineering of
features. The framework is based on computing a mapping
between a source and target context, where the mapping is
derived from population data.
Our results demonstrate that the ﬁve biometrics evalu-
ated in this paper show different degrees of resilience to
cross-context attacks. In particular, we showed that ECG
and gait are up to twice as unpredictable across contexts
compared to touch dynamics, mouse and eye movements.
Our analysis highlights particularly predictable features and
suggests that some of can be reasonably dropped from the
feature-set to achieve greater security against this attack.
Furthermore, our data suggests that improving the quality
of the biometric sensor improves the resilience of the au-
thentication system. The fact that some contexts are more
useful than others for the prediction shows that the sources
of biometric information potentially available to an attacker
need to be an integral part of any biometric threat model.

Complete Feature Analysis
In Table 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we report the results of the
computation of the unpredictability scores (Equation 5) for
individual features, for ECG, gait, touch dynamics, mouse
movements and eye movements, respectively. The tables
also report the complete list of features used in the paper
and their RMI (with the exception for gait that only shows
the results for the 25 most relevant features, for brevity).
We used the methodology described in Section 5.3 and the
target contexts explained in Section 6.1.

Optimization Problem
ξ ∈ R|Ffθ(X
u )(ξ) − FX
(s)
Let Dfθ =
be the
set in which the integrand of Equation 3 is non zero. In
general this depends upon the speciﬁc choice of the mapping
function fθ. Let lb(t) be the minimum observed value for
the target featureand ub(t) be the maximum, then, we deﬁne
a region around the observed target feature space as:
(t)
u
(cid:10)
(cid:9)
(ξ) (cid:6)= 0
(cid:11)
(t) − qΔ
lb
(t)
(t)
, ub
+ qΔ
(t)
D =
where Δ(t) = ub(t) − lb(t) and q > 0 is a relaxing factor.
Given a parametrized family of mapping functions {fθ}θ∈Θ,
we then deﬁne Θ to be:
Θ = {θ ∈ Rm|Dfθ
⊆ D} .
(7)
This constrains the range of the transformed source fea-
ture in a way that it is similar to the range of the tar-
get feature. Additionally, for every ξ ∈ R we have that
u )(ξ) − FX
0 ≤ (Ffθ(X
(ξ))2 ≤ 1, thus for every θ ∈ Θ,
(cid:6)
(cid:2)
(s)
we have that:
0 ≤
dξ ≤ m(D)
(cid:3)2
u )(ξ) − FX
Ffθ(X
(t)
u
(ξ)
(t)
u
(s)
D
where m(D) is the measure of D. Thus, by setting w =
1/m(D), we have that
the distance function deﬁned in
Equation 3 is normalized in [0, 1].
Finally, notice that the set of constraints 7 is linear if
fθ is linear with respect to the parameter vector θ (e.g. fθ
is a generic polynomial function) and hence can be solved
exactly (and efﬁciently) by an optimization algorithm. In
fact, in this case we have that fθ(x) = θT · h(x), for a
speciﬁc vector valued function h. Hence constraint 7 is
equivalent to checking for each feature value x observed
in the users population:
(t) − qΔ
lb
(t) ≤ θT · h(x) ≤ ub
which is linear in the parameter vector θ.

Degree Analysis
We list in Table 10 biometric unpredictability scores for
cross-context mappings of degrees from 1 to 4, using source
and target context pairs discussed in Section 6.1. Figure 7
shows how unpredictability scores are affected by different
polynomials fθ in the case of ECG biometric. Figure 7 and
Table 10 show that the relative ranking in terms of average
unpredictability scores for the biometrics is not affected by
the degree of fθ. For the 41 different source context pairs
that we have discussed a linear fθ provides an estimation
of the unpredictability score similar to that of polynomials
fθ.
The score of mouse movement biometrics is the only
one that slightly decreases as the degree of fθ increases,
