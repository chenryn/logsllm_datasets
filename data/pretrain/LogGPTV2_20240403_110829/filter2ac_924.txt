**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Browser Information Discovery

Adversaries may gather information about web browsers to gain a deeper understanding of the compromised environment. Browsers often store various types of data, including bookmarks, user accounts, and browsing history. This information can reveal personal details about users, such as their banking sites, relationships, interests, and social media activities. Additionally, it can provide insights into internal network resources, such as servers, tools, dashboards, and other related infrastructure. By enumerating this browser-stored data, adversaries can obtain valuable intelligence that may be used for further exploitation or to tailor their attacks more effectively.
