User: Your team leader asks you to design an automated deployment solution to quickly push the application to production after a code update. Please provide a preliminary design and consider how to test and roll back.
Assistant: Preliminary design: 1. Use Git to manage code, set up a main branch and a stable branch. 2. Use Jenkins for automated build and deployment. 3. Create a build project in Jenkins, set Git as source code management, and automatically build and package a deployable WAR package after detecting code updates. 4. Create a deployment project in Jenkins, upload the WAR package to the target server and deploy it, and perform a health check to ensure that the application starts successfully and can provide services. 5. Using this automation solution, the updated code can be quickly pushed to the production environment, which simplifies the deployment process and reduces human errors. Testing and rollback: 1. Before the code is updated, comprehensive testing is required, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, etc., to ensure that the new code does not introduce new problems or break existing functions. 2. Before switching to a new version, back up all the resources of the application, so that if a rollback is required, you can quickly roll back to the backup version. 3. After deploying the new version, conduct health checks and stress tests to ensure that the application can run normally and handle business requests. 4. If any problem is found, immediately roll back to the backup version, and conduct a detailed analysis and process of repairing the problem. At the same time, record all the problems and solutions that arise so that when you encounter similar problems in the future, you can solve them more quickly.
