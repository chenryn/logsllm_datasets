User: Please describe what agile development is, and its main practices and values.
Assistant: Agile development is a software development methodology aimed at delivering high-value software products faster and more efficiently. It is often faster, more adaptive, collaborative and flexible in response to product development and requirements changes, while maintaining software quality and meeting customer needs. The main practices of agile development are as follows: 1. User stories: By defining simple but detailed user requirements, it helps the team establish a clear understanding and specification of the software being built. 2. Iterative development: The software development process is decomposed into multiple short-cycle iterations, each iteration includes development, testing, and delivery function sets to quickly respond to changes in requirements. 3. Continuous integration: use automated testing and continuous integration techniques to continuously build, test, and analyze in order to achieve iteration goals within a certain quality and time. 4. The Kanban approach: Make each iteration visible and collaborative to the entire team through a Kanban or iteration planning board. The core values of agile development include: 1. Individuals and teams are more important than processes and tools, emphasizing the cooperation and communication of people in the development process to achieve the most efficient productivity. 2. Working software is more valuable than detailed documentation, emphasizing results first. 3. Responding to changes is more important than following a plan, emphasizing forward-looking planning and continuous adjustment and improvement in the iterative process. 4. Customer cooperation is more important than contract negotiation, emphasizing active communication and jointly promoting project development.
