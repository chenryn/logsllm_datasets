**Current behavior**
The following template describes using a structural directive with 2 options:
    Hello
But writing such a template results in the error: `Error: Template parse
errors: TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined`.
**Expected behavior**
    Hello
should de-sugarize to:
        Hello
This is what the microsyntax documentation describes.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
http://plnkr.co/edit/sMFv2iGJoOdCRlWpIs40?p=preview  
The plunker crashes with the described error.  
Using the manually de-sugarized
makes it work fine.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
When writing reusable components and directives, offering the asterisk syntax
is an important part of making the API easy to learn and understand. It
follows the `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` lead people are used to.
