**Current Behavior**
The following template uses a structural directive with two options:
```html
<ng-container *myDirective="option1; option2">
  Hello
</ng-container>
```
However, this results in the following error: `Error: Template parse errors: TypeError: Cannot read property 'toUpperCase' of undefined`.

**Expected Behavior**
The template should be de-sugared to:
```html
<ng-template [myDirective]="{option1: option1, option2: option2}">
  <ng-container *ngTemplateOutlet="myDirective.templateRef"></ng-container>
</ng-template>
```
This is in line with the microsyntax documentation.

**Minimal Reproduction of the Problem with Instructions**
- **Plunker Link**: [http://plnkr.co/edit/sMFv2iGJoOdCRlWpIs40?p=preview](http://plnkr.co/edit/sMFv2iGJoOdCRlWpIs40?p=preview)
- The Plunker example crashes with the described error.
- Manually de-sugaring the template as shown above resolves the issue and makes it work correctly.

**Motivation / Use Case for Changing the Behavior**
When developing reusable components and directives, providing the asterisk (`*`) syntax is crucial for making the API easy to learn and understand. This follows the established patterns set by `*ngIf` and `*ngFor`, which developers are already familiar with.

**Environment**
- **Angular Version**: 2.4.x
- **Browsers**: All
- **Languages**: All
