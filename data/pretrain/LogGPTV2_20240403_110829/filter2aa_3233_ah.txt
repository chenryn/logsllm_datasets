Appendix B—Identified Gaps in the Current State-of-the-Art in ZTA 
The current maturity of zero trust components and solutions was surveyed during the research 
conducted in the development of this document. This survey concluded that the current state of 
the ZTA ecosystem is not mature enough for widespread adoption. While it is possible to use 
ZTA strategies to plan and deploy an enterprise environment, there is no single solution that 
provides all the necessary components. Also, few ZTA components available today can be used 
for all of the various workflows present in an enterprise.  
The following is a summary of identified gaps in the ZTA ecosystem and areas that need further 
investigation. Some of these areas have some foundation of work, but how ZTA tenets change 
these areas is not well-known as there is not enough experience with diverse ZTA-focused 
enterprise environments. 
B.1 
Technology Survey 
Multiple vendors were invited to present their products and views on zero trust. The goal of this 
survey was to identify missing pieces that prevent agencies from moving to a zero trust based 
enterprise infrastructure now or maintaining an existing ZTA implementation. These gaps can be 
categorized into immediate deployment (immediate or short term), systemic gaps that affect 
maintenance or operations (short or midterm), and missing knowledge (areas for future research). 
They are summarized in Table B-1.

B.2 
Gaps that Prevent an Immediate Move to ZTA 
These are the issues that are slowing adoption of a ZTA at present. These were classified as 
immediate issues, and no thought of future maintenance or migration was considered for this 
category. A forward-thinking enterprise may also consider the maintenance category to be of 
immediate concern in preventing the initial deployment of ZTA components, but these issues are 
considered a separate category for this analysis. 
B.2.1 
Lack of Common Terms for ZTA Design, Planning, and Procurement 
Zero trust as a strategy for the design and deployment of enterprise infrastructure is still a 
forming concept. Industry has not yet coalesced around a single set of terms or concepts to 
describe ZTA components and operations. This makes it difficult for organizations (e.g., federal 
agencies) to develop coherent requirements and policies for designing zero trust enterprise 
infrastructure and procuring components. 
The driver for Sections 2.1 and 3.1 is an initial attempt to form a neutral base of terms and 
concepts to describe ZTA. The abstract ZTA components and deployment models were 
developed to serve as basic terms and ways to think about ZTA. The goal is to provide a 
common way to view, model, and discuss ZTA solutions when developing enterprise 
requirements and performing market surveys. The above sections may prove to be incomplete as 
more experience is gained with ZTA in federal agencies, but they currently serve as a base for a 
common conceptual framework. 
B.2.2 
Perception that ZTA Conflicts with Existing Federal Cybersecurity Policies 
There is a misconception that ZTA is a single framework with a set of solutions that are 
incompatible with the existing view of cybersecurity. Zero trust should instead be viewed as an 
evolution of current cybersecurity strategies as many of the concepts and ideas have been 
circulating for a long time. Federal agencies have been encouraged to take a more zero trust 
approach to cybersecurity through existing guidance (see Section 6). If an agency has a mature 
ID management system and robust CDM capabilities in place, it is on the road to a ZTA (see 
Section 7.3). This gap is based on a misconception of ZTA and how it has evolved from previous 
cybersecurity paradigms. 
B.3 
Systemic Gaps that Impact ZTA 
These are the gaps that affect initial implementation and deployment of ZTA and continued 
operation/maturity. These gaps could slow the adoption of ZTA in agencies or result in 
fragmentation of the ZTA component industry. Systemic gaps are areas where open standards 
(produced either by a standards development organization [SDO] or industry consortium) can 
help. 
B.3.3 
Standardization of Interfaces Between Components 
During the technology survey, it became apparent that no one vendor offers a single solution that 
will provide zero trust. Furthermore, it might not be desirable to use a single-vendor solution to 
NIST SP 800-207

achieve zero trust and thereby risk vendor lock-in. This leads to interoperability within 
components not only at the time of purchase but also over time.  
The spectrum of components within the wider enterprise is vast, with many products focusing on 
a single niche within zero trust and relying on other products to provide either data or some 
service to another component (e.g., integration of MFA for resource access). Vendors too often 
rely on proprietary APIs provided by partner companies rather than standardized, vendor-
independent APIs to achieve this integration. The problem with this approach is that these APIs 
are proprietary and single-vendor controlled. The controlling vendor can change the API 
behavior, and integrators are required to update their products in response. This requires close 
partnerships between communities of vendors to ensure early notification of modifications 
within APIs, which may affect compatibility between products. This adds an additional burden 
on vendors and consumers: vendors need to expend resources to change their products, and 
consumers need to apply updates to multiple products when one vendor makes a change to its 
proprietary API. Additionally, vendors are required to implement and maintain wrappers for each 
partner component to allow maximum compatibility and interoperability. For example, many 
MFA product vendors are required to create a different wrapper for each cloud provider or 
identity management system to be usable in different kinds of client combinations.   
On the customer side, this generates additional problems when developing requirements for 
purchasing products. There are no standards that purchasers can rely on to identify compatibility 
between products. Hence, it is very difficult to create a multiyear road map for moving into ZTA 
because it is impossible to identify a minimum set of compatibility requirements for components. 
B.3.4 
Emerging Standards that Address Overreliance on Proprietary APIs 
As there is no single solution to developing a ZTA, there is no single set of tools or services for a 
zero trust enterprise. Thus, it is impossible to have a single protocol or framework that enables an 
enterprise to move to a ZTA. Currently, there is a wide variety of models and solutions seeking 
to become the leading authority of ZTA. 
This indicates that there is an opportunity for a set of open, standardized protocols or frameworks 
to be developed to aid organizations in migrating to a ZTA. SDOs like the Internet Engineering 
Task Force (IETF) have specified protocols that may be useful in exchanging threat information 
(called XMPP-Grid [1]). The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has produced a framework for 
Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) [2] that may also be useful in ZTA. Efforts should be directed 
toward surveying the current state of ZTA-related frameworks or the protocols necessary for a 
useful ZTA and toward identifying places where work is needed to produce or improve these 
specifications. 
B.4 
Knowledge Gaps in ZTA and Future Areas of Research 
The gaps listed here do not hinder an organization from adopting a ZTA for its enterprise. These 
are gray areas in knowledge about operational ZTA environments, and most arise from a lack of 
time and experience with mature zero trust deployments. These are areas of future work for 
researchers.

B.4.5 
Attacker Response to ZTA 
A properly implemented ZTA for an enterprise will improve the enterprise’s cybersecurity 
posture over traditional network perimeter-based security. The tenets of ZTA aim to reduce the 
exposure of resources to attackers and minimize or prevent lateral movement within an 
enterprise should a host asset be compromised. 
However, determined attackers will not sit idle but will instead change behavior in the face of 
ZTA. The open issue is how the attacks will change. One possibility is that attacks aimed at 
stealing credentials will be expanded to target MFA (e.g., phishing, social engineering). Another 
possibility is that in a hybrid ZTA/perimeter-based enterprise, attackers will focus on the 
business processes that have not had ZTA tenets applied (i.e., follow traditional network 
perimeter-based security)—in effect, targeting the low-hanging fruit in an attempt to gain some 
foothold in the ZTA business process.  
As ZTA matures, more deployments are seen, and experience is gained, the effectiveness of ZTA 
in shrinking the attack surface of resources may become apparent. The metrics of success of 
ZTA over older cybersecurity strategies will also need to be developed. 
B.4.6 
User Experience in a ZTA Environment 
There has not been a rigorous examination of how end users act in an enterprise that is using a 
ZTA. This is mainly due to the lack of large ZTA use cases available for analysis. There have, 
however, been studies on how users react to MFA and other security operations that are part of a 
ZTA enterprise, and this work could form the basis of predicting end user experience and 
behavior when using ZTA workflows in an enterprise. 
One set of studies that can predict how ZTA affects end user experience is the work done on the 
use of MFA in enterprises and security fatigue. Security fatigue [3] is the phenomenon wherein 
end users are confronted with so many security policies and challenges that it begins to impact 
their productivity in a negative way. Other studies show that MFA may alter user behavior, but 
the overall change is mixed [4] [5]. Some users readily accept MFA if the process is streamlined 
and involves devices they are used to using or having with them (e.g., applications on a 
smartphone). However, some users resent having to use personally-owned devices for business 
processes or feel that they are being constantly monitored for possible violations of IT policies. 
B.4.7 
Resilience of ZTA to Enterprise and Network Disruption 
The survey of the ZTA vendor ecosystem displayed the wide range of infrastructure that an 
enterprise deploying a ZTA would need to consider. As previously noted, there is no single 
provider of a full zero trust solution at this time. As a result, enterprises will purchase several 
different services and products, which can lead to a web of dependencies for components. If one 
vital component is disrupted or unreachable, there could be a cascade of failures that impact one 
or multiple business processes. 
Most products and services surveyed relied on a cloud presence to provide robustness, but even 
cloud services have been known to become unreachable through either an attack or simple error. 
When this happens, key components used to make access decisions may be unreachable or may

not be able to communicate with other components. For example, PE and PA components 
located in a cloud may be reachable during a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack but may 
not be able to reach all PEPs located with resources. Research is needed on discovering the 
possible choke points of ZTA deployment models and the impact on network operations when a 
ZTA component is unreachable or has limited reachability. 
The continuity of operations (COOP) plans for an enterprise will likely need revision when 
adopting a ZTA. A ZTA makes many COOP factors easier as remote workers may have the 
same access to resources that they had on-premises. However, policies like MFA may also have 
a negative impact if users are not properly trained or lack experience. Users may forget or not 
have access to tokens and enterprise devices during an emergency, and that will impact the speed 
and effectiveness of enterprise business processes.
