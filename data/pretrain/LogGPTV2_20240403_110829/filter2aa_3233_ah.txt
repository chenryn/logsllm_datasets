### Appendix B—Identified Gaps in the Current State-of-the-Art in ZTA

During the research for this document, the current maturity of zero trust components and solutions was surveyed. The findings indicated that the ZTA ecosystem is not yet mature enough for widespread adoption. While it is feasible to plan and deploy an enterprise environment using ZTA strategies, no single solution currently provides all the necessary components. Additionally, few ZTA components available today can be used across the various workflows in an enterprise.

The following sections summarize the identified gaps in the ZTA ecosystem and areas that require further investigation. Some of these areas have some foundational work, but the impact of ZTA tenets on these areas is not well understood due to limited experience with diverse ZTA-focused enterprise environments.

#### B.1 Technology Survey

Multiple vendors were invited to present their products and views on zero trust. The goal was to identify missing pieces that prevent agencies from moving to a zero trust-based enterprise infrastructure or maintaining an existing ZTA implementation. These gaps are categorized into immediate deployment, systemic gaps affecting maintenance or operations, and areas needing more research. They are summarized in Table B-1.

#### B.2 Gaps that Prevent an Immediate Move to ZTA

These issues are currently slowing the adoption of ZTA. They are classified as immediate issues, with no consideration for future maintenance or migration.

##### B.2.1 Lack of Common Terms for ZTA Design, Planning, and Procurement

Zero trust as a strategy for enterprise infrastructure design and deployment is still evolving. The industry has not yet agreed on a single set of terms or concepts to describe ZTA components and operations. This makes it difficult for organizations, such as federal agencies, to develop coherent requirements and policies for designing zero trust enterprise infrastructure and procuring components.

Sections 2.1 and 3.1 aim to form a neutral base of terms and concepts to describe ZTA. The abstract ZTA components and deployment models were developed to serve as basic terms and ways to think about ZTA. The goal is to provide a common way to view, model, and discuss ZTA solutions when developing enterprise requirements and performing market surveys. These sections may be incomplete but currently serve as a foundation for a common conceptual framework.

##### B.2.2 Perception that ZTA Conflicts with Existing Federal Cybersecurity Policies

There is a misconception that ZTA is a single, incompatible framework with existing cybersecurity views. Instead, zero trust should be seen as an evolution of current cybersecurity strategies. Many of the concepts and ideas have been circulating for a long time, and federal agencies have been encouraged to take a more zero trust approach through existing guidance (see Section 6). If an agency has a mature ID management system and robust CDM capabilities, it is on the road to a ZTA (see Section 7.3). This gap is based on a misconception of ZTA and its evolution from previous cybersecurity paradigms.

#### B.3 Systemic Gaps that Impact ZTA

These gaps affect the initial implementation and continued operation/maturity of ZTA. They could slow adoption or result in fragmentation of the ZTA component industry. Open standards produced by SDOs or industry consortia can help address these gaps.

##### B.3.3 Standardization of Interfaces Between Components

No single vendor offers a complete zero trust solution, and relying on a single-vendor solution can lead to vendor lock-in. This highlights the need for interoperability within components, not only at the time of purchase but also over time. The spectrum of components within the enterprise is vast, with many products focusing on specific niches and relying on other products for data or services. Vendors often use proprietary APIs, which can change, requiring updates and close partnerships between vendors. This adds a burden on both vendors and consumers, who must apply updates to multiple products.

On the customer side, the lack of standards for identifying compatibility between products makes it difficult to create a multiyear roadmap for moving to ZTA. It is impossible to identify a minimum set of compatibility requirements for components.

##### B.3.4 Emerging Standards that Address Overreliance on Proprietary APIs

There is no single solution or set of tools for a zero trust enterprise, making it impossible to have a single protocol or framework. Various models and solutions are seeking to become the leading authority on ZTA, indicating an opportunity for open, standardized protocols or frameworks. Efforts should be directed toward surveying the current state of ZTA-related frameworks and protocols and identifying areas where work is needed to produce or improve these specifications.

#### B.4 Knowledge Gaps in ZTA and Future Areas of Research

These gaps do not hinder the adoption of ZTA but represent gray areas in knowledge about operational ZTA environments, arising from a lack of time and experience with mature zero trust deployments.

##### B.4.5 Attacker Response to ZTA

A properly implemented ZTA improves an enterprise's cybersecurity posture over traditional network perimeter-based security. However, determined attackers will adapt. One possibility is that attacks aimed at stealing credentials will target MFA (e.g., phishing, social engineering). In a hybrid ZTA/perimeter-based enterprise, attackers may focus on business processes that have not adopted ZTA tenets. As ZTA matures, the effectiveness in shrinking the attack surface will become apparent, and metrics for success over older cybersecurity strategies will need to be developed.

##### B.4.6 User Experience in a ZTA Environment

There has not been a rigorous examination of how end users act in a ZTA environment, mainly due to the lack of large ZTA use cases. Studies on MFA and security fatigue can predict end user experience and behavior in a ZTA enterprise. Security fatigue occurs when users are confronted with too many security policies and challenges, impacting productivity. MFA acceptance varies; some users readily accept it if the process is streamlined, while others resent using personal devices for business processes.

##### B.4.7 Resilience of ZTA to Enterprise and Network Disruption

The ZTA vendor ecosystem survey revealed the wide range of infrastructure an enterprise needs to consider. There is no single provider of a full zero trust solution, leading to a web of dependencies. If a vital component is disrupted, there could be a cascade of failures. Most products and services rely on cloud presence, but even cloud services can become unreachable. Research is needed to discover possible choke points and the impact on network operations when a ZTA component is unreachable or has limited reachability.

Continuity of operations (COOP) plans will likely need revision when adopting a ZTA. Remote workers may have the same access to resources, but MFA policies may have a negative impact if users are not properly trained or lack experience.
