User: I am planning on writing a small program that interacts with a debian based repository - namely doing a partial mirror**. I am planning to write it in python.
What are some tips for working with the repository including already constructed 'wheels' (to save the invention of yet another one)?
Some issues I have identified

As it is going to be a partial mirror, I will need to regenerate the package lists (Release,Contents*, Packages.{bz2,gz}). (Maybe debian-installer can do it for me??)
How to get changes to package list (I already know that packages do not change, but that the lists only link to the latest file)?

** Already looked into apt-mirror and debmirror. Debmirror is the closest to what I want, however lacking in some features. If apt can deal with multiple releases and architectures then I will consider apt.
Assistant: debian-installer doesn't generate repository metadata. For that, you want a tool like reprepro or mini-dinstall. They'll also handle the second point you raised.
