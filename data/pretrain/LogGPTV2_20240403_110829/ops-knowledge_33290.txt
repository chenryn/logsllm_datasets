I am planning to write a small program in Python that interacts with a Debian-based repository, specifically to create a partial mirror. I would appreciate any tips on working with the repository, especially when utilizing pre-existing 'wheels' to avoid reinventing the wheel.

### Identified Issues and Questions

1. **Regenerating Package Lists:**
   - Since this will be a partial mirror, I need to regenerate the package lists (e.g., `Release`, `Contents*`, `Packages.{bz2,gz}`). Is there a tool or method within the Debian ecosystem, such as `debian-installer`, that can help me with this task?

2. **Updating Package Lists:**
   - How can I update the package lists to reflect changes? I understand that the packages themselves do not change, but the lists should link to the latest files. What is the best way to handle this?

### Research and Considerations

- I have already looked into tools like `apt-mirror` and `debmirror`. `debmirror` is the closest to what I need, but it lacks some features.
- If `apt` can handle multiple releases and architectures, I will consider using it.

### Additional Information

- For generating repository metadata, tools like `reprepro` or `mini-dinstall` are more appropriate than `debian-installer`. These tools can also manage the updates to the package lists.

Any further advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.
