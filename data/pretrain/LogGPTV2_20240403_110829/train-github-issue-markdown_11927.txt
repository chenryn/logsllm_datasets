hey, i am deploying my nextjs app on nginx where django is running on nginx. i
want my nextjs app to run on **mydomain/something** but its not working giving
404 page not found error whereas when i run it on mydomain/ it work fine.  
please suggest something how i can run it. i followed your wiki link but its
not working.do i need to change my server.js file which is like this.
`const next = require('next')  
const routes = require('./routes')  
const app = next()  
const handler = routes.getRequestHandler(app)
// Without express.js  
const {createServer} = require('http')  
app.prepare().then(() => {  
createServer(handler).listen(4000, err => {  
if (err) throw err  
console.log('> Ready on http://192.168.90.12:4000')  
})  
})`
