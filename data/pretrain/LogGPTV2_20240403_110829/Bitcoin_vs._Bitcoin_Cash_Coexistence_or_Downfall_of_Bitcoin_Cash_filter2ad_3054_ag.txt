merged mining because of following reasons: It is complex to
implement merged mining, and miners should do additional
work [53].
The another way is to increase the price of coinB through
price manipulation. However, as far as we know, the problem
of maintaining the increased coin price through price manip-
ulation is not well-studied. Moreover, we can consider a way
to increase the relative incentive of coinB mining to coinA
mining, where it can be achieved by increasing the block
reward or decreasing the average time of block generation.
Even though this method may help prevent the rivalry coin

from stealing loyal miners, it would cause other side effects
such as inﬂation or the increase in fork rate [25], [18].
Lastly, coinB can change its consensus protocol, the PoW
mechanism, to another protocol. However, this process would
not be supported by existing miners in coinB. For example,
Ethereum is planning to switch from a proof-of-work mech-
anism to a proof-of-stake mechanism for several years. How-
ever, note that if the consensus protocol is just changed through
a hard fork, the existing miners may leave because they can
lose their own merits (e.g., powerful hardware capability) for
mining coinB.
B. Environmental factors
In practice, miners’ behavior can deviate from our model
because of the following environmental factors.
Not all miners are rational. First, miners are not always
rational or wise. Even if ﬁckle mining or coinA mining is more
proﬁtable than coinB mining, some miners may be reluctant
to engage in ﬁckle mining or coinA mining because they may
not recognize the proﬁtability in doing so. However, our data
analysis conﬁrms that most miners are rational. In addition, if
miners use the automatic mining function, they would always
follow the most proﬁtable strategy.
Some miners consider the long-term price of coins. Because
price prediction is signiﬁcantly difﬁcult [54], we believe that
most miners behave depending on the short-term price of
a coin rather than the long-term price. For example, who
could have predicted the hash war between ABC and BSV
in advance? Therefore, as can be seen from the history of
the Bitcoin system, most miners behave depending on short-
term proﬁts. To model more realistic and general situations,
our model considered both rational miners who are interested
in short-term proﬁts and coinB factions (Ωstick) which are
interested in long-term proﬁts.
Some miners prefer the stable coexistence of coins. Some
miners may want the stable coexistence of coins for coin
market stability, and they may try to reach the equilibrium
representing the coexistence of coins regardless of their proﬁts.
If the fraction of such miners is large, a state would move
to the equilibrium (0, k
k+1 ) regardless of its zones. Based on
historical observations of the Bitcoin system, however, the
fraction of these miners seems unlikely to be high in the real-
world.
Other selﬁsh mining. In this study, we considered only ﬁckle
mining, which is a type of rational mining. However, miners
engaging in various form of selﬁsh mining [15], [22], [23],
[24] might cause a deviation from our analysis.
X. CONCLUSION
In this study, we modeled and analyzed the game between
two coins for ﬁckle mining, and our results imply that ﬁckle
mining can lead to a lack of loyal miners in the less valued coin
system. We conﬁrm that this lack of loyal miners can weaken
the overall health of coin systems by analyzing real-world
history. In addition, our analysis is extended to the analysis
of automatic mining, which shows a potentially severe risk
of automatic mining. As of Dec. 2018, BCH’s loyal miners
would leave if more than about 5% of the total mining power
in BTC and BCH is involved in automatic mining. Moreover,
we explained how one coin can steal the loyal miners from
other less valued rivalry coins in the highly competitive coin
market by generalizing our game model. We believe that this
is one of the serious threats for a cryptocurrency system using
a PoW mechanism.
