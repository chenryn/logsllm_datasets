inferred from partial data, such as scraped from the shop’s
public front end. Another interesting question is how metrics
could be derived for high-level consumer advice, e.g. for
customers to compare banks by their aggregate fraud risk.
11 Conclusion
We have presented the ﬁrst inside analysis of an underground
marketplace for stolen credit and debit cards. We found that
most of the supply (97%) and revenue (95%) originated from
stolen magnetic stripe data. The shop’s supply and proﬁts
continued to increase even three years after the U.S. shifted
liability for fraud using counterfeit cards to merchants who
failed to read the chip of EMV-enabled cards.
The shop accumulated an inventory of 19 M stolen mag-
netic stripe accounts, but the majority (60%) of them did not
sell. Buyers had clear preferences for accounts issued by
certain banks, and for cards that did not support EMV, likely
because buyers perceived them as more vulnerable to fraud.
While we do not know whether these perceptions were ac-
curate, the reality for affected account holders was that their

stolen accounts incurred a disproportionate amount of fraud
attempts compared to accounts stolen from issuers perceived
as more secure. Our hope is that by further studying and
understanding these marketplaces, we can inform new and
more effective directions for mitigating this threat.

A Appendix
In this appendix, we present additional statistics computed
from the carder shop’s database.
Sellers. The largest seller of magnetic stripe accounts had
a commission 25 percentage points higher than the aver-
age of all other magnetic stripe sellers. The largest releases
contained 2.5 M magnetic stripe, and 8,611 CNP accounts.
The smallest release for magnetic stripe was only 1 account,
whereas for CNP it was 14.
Buyers. Magnetic stripe buyers tended to spend more than
CNP buyers, as shown in Figure 6. The median net spend of
magnetic stripe-only buyers was $89.35 for 7 non-refunded
purchases, as opposed to $34.25 for 3 non-refunded purchases
in the case of CNP-only buyers. Buyers active in both do-
mains exhibited the highest median net spend of $333.67 on
28 non-refunded purchases. Among them was the overall
highest spending buyer, who, over the course of 3 years and
76 days, bought 16.2 k magnetic stripe and CNP accounts
(plus 752 that were refunded) for a net total of $495 k after
refunds.
Pricing. The shop database contained 1.3 k accounts (0.02%
of sales) with a purchase price higher than the initial listing
price.
Supply and Demand. When the shop opened in the ﬁrst
half of 2015, sellers added between 9,255 and 41,005 unique
accounts to the shop’s inventory each week, as shown in Fig-
ure 4. Nearly all supply was in U.S. magnetic stripe accounts.
Supply increased drastically from November 2015 to Febru-
ary 2016, staying above 70,000 unique accounts per week for
ﬁfteen weeks and reaching a maximum of 123,929, before
returning to the prior rhythm for another seven months. Over-
all, there was an average of 38,800 accounts added per week
in 2015. Weekly supply increased each year, with 48,400
accounts added weekly in 2016, 64,600 in 2017, and 93,600
in 2018 and 2019.
Refunds. For refundable magnetic stripe and CNP accounts,
customers checked 57.8% and 100% of their purchases, re-
spectively. Actual refunds of refundable magnetic stripe pur-
chases increased slightly from 31% in 2015 to 38% in 2018.
The overall refund rates were 25% and 13% of sold accounts,
for magnetic stripe and CNP accounts, respectively. The
lower rate for CNP might partially be due to a higher fraction
of non-refundable sales. On a per-buyer basis, the median
refund rates were 32% of magnetic stripe accounts, and 0%
of CNP (averages: 31% and 11%). High refund rates had
negative consequences for buyers, as they gradually reduced
the time window during which purchases were eligible for
refund. Customers with over 40% refunds lost eligibility for
refunds.
Figure 12: Weekly median price of purchased accounts. The
shaded area represents the range between the 25th and 75th
percentiles. Median purchase prices for CNP were initially
lower than for magnetic stripe accounts but increased over
time, whereas magnetic stripe prices decreased.
Figure 13: Box plot of time remaining until the expiration
date when U.S. magnetic stripe accounts were added to the
shop. From 2016 to 2018, the median remaining lifetime of
non-EMV accounts increased by 110 days, suggesting that
new non-EMV accounts were issued after the liability shift.
