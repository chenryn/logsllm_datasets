### 3.3 Applications and Backscatter in IPv6

To better understand the prevalence of monitoring in IPv6 and its impact on DNS backscatter, we conducted scans on specific application ports. Our approach involves two main steps: establishing a baseline response rate and comparing the resulting DNS backscatter from scans on different ports.

#### Experimental Setup

For both experiments, we scanned targets from our largest list, the rDNS hitlist. We evaluated the frequency of expected replies (e.g., ICMP echo reply in response to an echo request), unexpected replies (e.g., ICMP destination unreachable), and the absence of replies.

#### Direct Scans

Table 2 summarizes the results of direct scans on five different application ports. As expected, the response rates vary by application, with the highest response rate from ICMP (62.9%) and the lowest from NTP (4.7%). These findings are consistent with previous application scans, though our target lists show slightly higher response rates compared to random scanning. Additionally, our IPv4 response rates are comparable to those in IPv6.

| Application | Expected Reply | Other Reply | No Reply |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| ICMP6 (ping) | 62.9%          | 13.9%       | 23.2%    |
| TCP22 (SSH)  | 27.8%          | 13.9%       | 58.3%    |
| TCP80 (Web)  | 30.0%          | -           | 70.0%    |
| UDP53 (DNS)  | 4.7%           | 45.5%       | 49.4%    |
| UDP123 (NTP) | 4.7%           | 45.5%       | 49.4%    |

#### DNS Backscatter Analysis

Having established that our target list is representative, we next examine the DNS backscatter triggered by these scans. Our goal is to understand what DNS backscatter reveals about our scans, which can help us evaluate what it shows for other scanners.

Table 3 provides an overview of DNS backscatter detections and their yield, indicating the number of replies relative to different types of responses (expected, other, or no reply). The yield is small, ranging from 0.12% for ICMP echo (ICMP6) to 0.04% for DNS (UDP53), consistent with limited monitoring in IPv6 compared to IPv4 (0.2-0.3%).

| Application | Expected Reply Yield | Other Reply Yield | No Reply Yield |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| ICMP6 (ping) | 0.09%                | 0.002%            | 0.03%          |
| TCP22 (SSH)  | 0.03%                | 0.006%            | 0.02%          |
| TCP80 (Web)  | 0.04%                | 0.006%            | 0.02%          |
| UDP53 (DNS)  | 0.01%                | 0.02%             | 0.02%          |
| UDP123 (NTP) | 0.01%                | 0.01%             | 0.03%          |

The relationship between DNS backscatter and applications is not straightforward, as DNS backscatter typically results from logging, and the decision to log depends on the perceived sensitivity of the protocol. For common protocols like ICMP6 and web, more DNS backscatter is observed from IP addresses that return the expected reply. For less common protocols like DNS and NTP, DNS backscatter is more frequent for hosts that do not respond, suggesting that organizations may be logging traffic to closed ports.

### 4. Finding Scanning Activity in IPv6 Using DNS Backscatter

Having established the presence of DNS backscatter in IPv6, we now examine the extent of scanning activity observed over six months of data from B-Root DNS.

#### Datasets

- **DNS Backscatter**: We extracted all reverse DNS records for IPv6 from July to December 2017 at B-Root. The dataset includes 31 million unique querier-originator pairs, 435,000 unique queriers, and 29 million unique IPv6 originators.
- **Backbone Traffic**: We used MAWI traffic traces captured at a transit link of AS2500 (WIDE) from June 2017 to March 2018. The data sample is taken for 15 minutes at 2 PM JST each day, yielding approximately 7 million IPv6 packets per day.
- **Darknet Traffic**: We operated a /37 IPv6 darknet from June 2017 to March 2018, capturing 15,000 packets from 106 source IPs.

#### Heuristic Classifier

We defined a network scanner as a source IPv6 address that:
1. Has five or more destination IPs.
2. All go to a common destination port.
3. Sends, on average, fewer than ten packets per destination IP.
4. Has packet length entropy smaller than 0.1.

These criteria help distinguish network scans from DNS resolvers, which query a wide variety of QNAMEs.

#### Backscatter Detection

Table 4 shows the mean number of each group detected per week over six months. DNS backscatter detects a variety of services, including large service and cloud providers (Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) and CDNs. Well-known services account for about 12% of DNS backscatter, with reverse name checks being part of validation for services such as NTP and SMTP.

| Category | Count (mean/week) | % of Total |
|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Services | 4722              | 70.24%     |
| Routers  | 3653              | 54.34%     |
| Potential Abuse | 216              | 3.21%      |
| Total    | 6724              | 100%       |

We also observed a significant number of routers and tunnel interfaces, likely due to traceroutes from topology studies. Finally, the smallest but most critical category is potential abuse, with 17 spammers, 16 scanners, and 95 events consistent with scanning, on average per week.

#### Confirming Scanners

We identified seven scanners in the backbone and darknet data. DNS backscatter provides a global view but only captures large events. Backbone and darknet data, while narrowly focused, see only events that traverse specific networks.

In conclusion, DNS backscatter is a valuable tool for detecting scanning activity in IPv6, providing insights into the behavior of various services, routers, and potential abuse.
