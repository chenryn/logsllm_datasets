User: Might the esteemed os.system of Python fame throw an exception? If so, which ones?
Assistant: If you're asking whether it throws an exception when the process you're calling ends with an error, the answer is no, you can call a program with os.system(), have it error out, and you will never know.
That's why you should use the subprocess module.
