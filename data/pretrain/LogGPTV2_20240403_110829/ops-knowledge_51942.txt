User:  In a system based on a cloud computing platform, how to protect the security of user data?
Assistant: The methods to protect the security of system user data based on cloud computing platform are as follows: 1. Encryption: encrypt during data transmission, and store encrypted data to prevent hackers from stealing or tampering. 2. Access control: Only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive data in the system, and other users have no permission to read, modify or delete. 3. Security verification: Use security verification measures such as two-factor verification to ensure that system login can only be performed by authorized personnel. 4. Data Backup: Back up data and store it on a separate server to prevent data loss or accidental damage. 5. Security monitoring: Monitor user activities, report abnormal behaviors in time and take corresponding measures. 6. Security vulnerability and risk assessment: regularly conduct security vulnerability and risk assessment, discover and repair system loopholes or weaknesses in time, and ensure system security.
