User: Please provide a description of database transactions and describe what the ACID properties mean in a transaction.
Assistant: database transaction is a series of related operations performed in a database that are considered a single logical unit of work and must be committed when all operations succeed, or rolled back. ACID refers to the four properties that transactions must meet: 1. Atomicity: Transactions are regarded as an indivisible unit, and all operations must succeed or fail. If any part of the operation fails, the entire transaction must be rolled back to the state before the operation. 2. Consistency: The database must be in a consistent state before the transaction is executed, and it must also be in a consistent state after the transaction is executed. Consistency guarantees that the modifications made by each transaction during execution must comply with the integrity constraints of the database. 3. Isolation: The execution of transactions must be isolated from each other and cannot affect each other. An executing transaction is isolated from modifications made by other concurrently executing transactions, and other transactions cannot see the changes until the transaction is committed. 4. Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its changes must be permanently saved in the database and cannot be lost. Even if the system fails or some reasons cause the system to restart, it must be guaranteed that the changes of the transaction will not be lost.
