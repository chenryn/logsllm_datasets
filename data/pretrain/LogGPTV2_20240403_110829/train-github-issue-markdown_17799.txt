### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Enable `preprocessor.get_feature_names_out()` where `preprocessor` is a
ColumnTransformer with SimpleImputer.
### Describe your proposed solution
If you do this on sklearn v1.0, you get the error:
    AttributeError: Transformer simpleimputer-1 (type SimpleImputer) does not provide get_feature_names_out.
The solution is to add `get_feature_names_out()` to `SimpleImputer`. This
should be fairly straightforward, since there's a one-to-one mapping between
input and output features in this transformer. Additionally, it's high impact
since `SimpleImputer` is a common use case when preprocessing data.
