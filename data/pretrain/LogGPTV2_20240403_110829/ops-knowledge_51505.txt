Assistant: This log chunk shows the execution of tasks in stages 1 and 2. In stage 1, tasks 3.0 and 2.0 were completed and their results were sent to the driver. In stage 2, tasks 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 were assigned and started running. Additionally, broadcast variable 11 was read and stored in memory. Finally, blocks rdd_2_4, rdd_2_3, rdd_2_2, and rdd_2_0 were found locally.
