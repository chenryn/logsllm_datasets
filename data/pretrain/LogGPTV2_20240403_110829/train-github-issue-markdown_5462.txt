### Issue Description

I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

#### Expected Behavior
The `children` prop type should not be required for the `Typography` component. Users can set the content using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute. Additionally, this prop was not marked as required in the previous `flow-types` implementation.

#### Current Behavior
A warning is logged in the console if the `Typography` component is used as an empty tag (i.e., without any children).

#### Environment
- **Material-UI:** 1.0.0-beta.25
- **React:** 16.2.0
