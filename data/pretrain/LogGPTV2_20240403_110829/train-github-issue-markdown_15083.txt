 **Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
bug
**What is the current behavior?**
Error event fired twice when in development mode.
In the example you can see that '>>>>>>error' is logged twice while I only
expect to see it once.
Note: this issue doesn't happen with the production version of react
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

          function onClick (e) {
            e.stopPropagation()
            e.preventDefault()
            throw new Error('-------------');

          ReactDOM.render(
            button,
            document.getElementById('root')
          );
