User: So I installed pydiction into vim for autocompleting my python code in windows. No problemo. Worked like a charm. 
Tried the same thing with my Ubuntu setup, creating the .vim/after/ftplugin directory in my home folder and updating the vimrc with the correct path of the pydiction dictionary but I fail every time. Why is that ? I follow the readme.txt closely , I even found a webpage that describes the process on ubuntu again repeating the same things , nothing. 
Each time I tab after i type "raw" while it worked in windows in ubuntu it reports "Dictionary Completion (^K^N^P) Pattern not Found". Tried other keyword , same problem. Anyone has an idea why this happens ?
Assistant: That's the way my same problem i solve:
before i get this problem - i was set the path only to directory and that's was wrong
After i set the path Including the filename it starts work!
