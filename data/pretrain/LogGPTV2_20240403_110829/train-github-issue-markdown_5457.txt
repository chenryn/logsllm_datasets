In the `fluent-ffmpeg` documentation it is said:
> The second kind of preset is preset functions. To use those, pass a function
> which takes an FfmpegCommand as a parameter.
And a code example:
    function myPreset(command) {
      command.format('avi').size('720x?');
    }
    ffmpeg('/path/to/file.avi').preset(myPreset);
According to the example code, the preset function should return `void`.
We have the following type  
DefinitelyTyped/types/fluent-ffmpeg/index.d.ts
Line 42 in e7e4e74
|  type GetPreset = (command: FfmpegCommand) => string;  
---|---  
which does not match the expected signature of the preset function. I believe
it should be
    type GetPreset = (command: FfmpegCommand) => void;
Also, in this case the type name itself is not very much suitable, it should
be something like `PresetFunction`.
Besides that, I guess there are two typos here (pr **o** set and p **n**
reset):  
DefinitelyTyped/types/fluent-ffmpeg/index.d.ts
Lines 362 to 363 in e7e4e74
|  usingPreset(proset: string | GetPreset): FfmpegCommand;  
---|---  
|  pnreset(proset: string | GetPreset): FfmpegCommand;  
There is another method spelled properly which seems to be a duplicate of the
misspelled one mentioned above:  
DefinitelyTyped/types/fluent-ffmpeg/index.d.ts
Line 323 in e7e4e74
|  preset(format: string): FfmpegCommand;  
---|---
