When building a native addon for Electron on Windows, node-gyp downloads the
`.lib` files for linking from `https://atom.io/download/electron//win-x86/node.lib`. This link is now accessible for version numbers
4.0.0 and above, and 404 for lower version numbers. I assume that is
unintentional because I have not seen any announcement about those versions no
longer being supported.
