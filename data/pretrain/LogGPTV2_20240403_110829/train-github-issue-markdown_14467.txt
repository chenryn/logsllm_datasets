Code:
    // Setup
    var testObj = {
      12: "Namath",
      16: "Montana",
      19: "Unitas"
    };
    // Only change code below this line;
    var playerNumber;       // Change this Line
    var player = testObj;   // Change this Line
If you use this code:
    var playerNumber = 16;// Change this Line
    testObj[playerNumber]
    var player;   // Change this Line
The challenge will pass.

However, the correct response is:
    var playerNumber = 16;// Change this Line
    var player = testObj[playerNumber];   // Change this Line
