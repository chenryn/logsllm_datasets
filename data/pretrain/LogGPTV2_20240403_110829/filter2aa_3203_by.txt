encryption) is known as L2TP/IPsec, as RFC 3193 describes. For more information about ESP, see 
Chapter 13, "Internet Protocol Security and Packet Filtering." 
Figure 14-5 shows the result after ESP is applied to an IPv4 packet that contains an L2TP frame.

Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP) 
PPTP and L2TP/IPsec traffic can have problems traversing firewalls, network address translators 
(NATs), and Web proxies. SSTP in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista Service Pack 1 solves 
these VPN connectivity problems by using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) over secure sockets 
layer (SSL). SSL is also known as Transport Layer Security (TLS). HTTP over SSL on TCP port 443 is 
the protocol that is used on the Web for collecting credit card numbers and other private data. 
Whenever you connect to a Web address that begins with https:, you are using HTTP over SSL. Using 
HTTP over SSL solves many VPN protocol connectivity problems because typical firewalls, NATs, and 
Web proxies allow this type of traffic. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking

SSTP uses an HTTP-over-SSL session between VPN clients and servers to exchange encapsulated 
IPv4 or IPv6 packets. Note that an HTTP-over-SSL-based remote access VPN connection is different 
from the connection made by an application that uses HTTP over SSL. For example, Outlook® Web 
Access (OWA) lets you access your Microsoft Exchange e-mail at your enterprise over the Internet. 
OWA uses an HTTP over SSL-encrypted session, but this is not the same as a remote access 
connection. Although you can view your e-mail with OWA, you can’t reach the location of an intranet 
URL that is embedded within an Exchange e-mail message. 
Unlike the PPTP and L2TP/IPsec protocols, SSTP does not support site-to-site VPN connections. 
Figure 14-6 shows the structure of IPv4 or IPv6 packets that are sent over an SSTP-based VPN 
connection. 
Figure 14-6  Structure of SSTP packets 
An IPv4 or IPv6 packet is first encapsulated with a PPP header and an SSTP header. The combination 
of the IPv4 or IPv6 packet, the PPP header, and the SSTP header is encrypted by the SSL session. A 
TCP header and an IPv4 header (for SSTP connections across the IPv4 Internet) or an IPv6 header (for 
SSTP connections across the IPv6 Internet) are added to complete the packet.

Remote Access VPN Connections 
Both Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP include a remote access VPN client and a remote access 
VPN server. 
VPN Client Support 
Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 include a built-in VPN 
client that supports PPTP and L2TP/IPsec. The VPN client in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and 
Windows Server 2008 also supports SSTP. You can configure a remote access VPN connection by 
using either the Network Connections folder or Connection Manager. 
Network Connections Folder 
If you have a small number of VPN clients, you can manually configure a VPN connection for each 
client. For clients running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, click the Set up a connection or 
network task in the Network and Sharing Center. In the Set up a connection or network dialog box, 
double-click Connect to a workplace and follow the Connect to a workplace wizard to create a VPN 
connection. 
For clients running Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, use the New Connection Wizard in the 
Network Connections folder to create the VPN connection. Within the New Connection Wizard, click 
Connect to the network at my workplace on the Network Connection Type page and click Virtual 
Private Network connection on the Network Connection page. 
Connection Manager 
If you try to manually configure remote access VPN connections for thousands of clients in an 
enterprise organization, you will probably experience one or more of the following problems: 
The exact procedure to configure a VPN connection varies depending on the version of Windows 
running on the client computer, so training end users to configure these connections will require 
multiple sets of training materials. 
To prevent configuration errors, the information technology (IT) staff should manually configure the VPN 
connection rather than end users, placing a large administrative burden on the IT staff.  
A VPN connection may need a double-dial configuration, in which a user must connect to the Internet 
before connecting to the organization intranet. This requirement makes training end users even more 
complicated. 
To configure VPN connections for an enterprise organization, you can use the following components: 
Connection Manager 
Connection Manager Administration Kit 
Connection Point Services 
Connection Manager is a client dialer with advanced features that offer a superset of basic dial-up and 
VPN networking. Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003 includes a set of tools that you can 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 413 
use deliver pre-configured connections to network users. These tools are the Connection Manager 
Administration Kit (CMAK) and Connection Point Services (CPS).  
You can use CMAK to tailor the appearance and behavior of a connection made with Connection 
Manager. With CMAK, you can develop client dialer and connection software that allows users to 
connect to the network by using only the connection features that you define for them. Connection 
Manager supports a variety of features that both simplify and enhance the deployment of connection 
support for you and your users, and you can incorporate most of those features using the Connection 
Manager Administration Kit Wizard. By using CMAK, you can create custom profiles that reflect the 
identity, online help, and support infrastructure of your organization. 
By using Connection Point Services (CPS), you can automatically create, distribute, and update custom 
phone books. These phone books contain one or more Point of Presence (POP) entries, with each 
POP entry storing a telephone number that provides dial-up access to a local ISP. Phone books give 
users complete POP information so that, when they travel, they can connect to different Internet access 
points rather than being restricted to a single POP. 
Without the ability to update phone books (a task CPS handles automatically), users would have to 
contact their organization's technical support staff for changes in POP information and to reconfigure 
their client dialer software. 
CPS has two components:  
1. Phone Book Administrator 
A tool used to create and maintain the phone book database and to publish new phone book 
information to Phone Book Service.  
2. Phone Book Service 
An Internet Information Services (IIS) extension that automatically checks subscribers' or corporate 
employees' current phone books and, if necessary, downloads a phone book update.  
VPN Server Support 
Using Routing and Remote Access in Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2003, you can 
configure a VPN server that supports PPTP, L2TP/IPsec, and, for Windows Server 2008, SSTP.  
To configure a computer running Windows Server 2008 to act as a VPN server, do the following: 
1. Configure your server with a static IPv4 address on each of its intranet interfaces. 
2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Server Manager. 
3. In the console tree, right-click Roles, click Add Roles, and then click Next. 
4. On the Select Server Roles page, select the Network Policy and Access Services check box, and 
then click Next. 
5. Follow the pages of the Add Roles wizard. 
6. From the console tree of the Routing and Remote Access snap-in, right click the server name and 
click Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access. 
7. Follow the pages of the Routing and Remote Access wizard to configure the server as a VPN server. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 414 
To configure a computer running Windows Server 2003 to act as a VPN server, do the following: 
1. Configure your server with a static IPv4 address on each of its intranet interfaces. 
2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Routing And Remote 
Access. 
3. Right-click your server name, and then click Configure and enable Routing And Remote Access. 
Click Next. 
4. On the Configuration page, click Remote Access (dial-up or VPN), and then click Next. 
5. On the Remote Access page, click VPN, and then click Next. 
6. On the VPN Connection page, click the connection that corresponds to the interface connected to 
the Internet or your perimeter network, and then click Next. 
7. On the IP Address Assignment page, click Automatically if the VPN server should use DHCP to 
obtain IPv4 addresses for remote access VPN clients. Or, click From a specified range of 
addresses to use one or more static ranges of addresses. When IP address assignment is complete, 
click Next. 
8. On the Managing Multiple Remote Access Servers page, if you are using RADIUS for 
authentication and authorization, click Yes, set up this server to work with a RADIUS server, and 
then click Next. 
On the RADIUS Server Selection page, configure the primary (mandatory) and alternate (optional) 
RADIUS servers and the shared secret, and then click Next. 
9. Click Finish. 
10. When you are prompted to configure the DHCP Relay Agent, click OK. 
11. In the tree of Routing and Remote Access, open IP Routing. 
12. Right-click DHCP Relay Agent, and click Properties. 
13. On the General tab of the DHCP Relay Agent Properties dialog box, add the IPv4 addresses that 
correspond to your intranet DHCP servers, and click OK. 
By default, Routing and Remote Access creates 128 PPTP and 128 L2TP/IPsec logical ports. If you 
need more ports, configure the WAN Miniport (PPTP) or WAN Miniport (L2TP) devices from the 
properties of the Ports object in the tree of Routing and Remote Access.  
By default, the Routing and Remote Access Server Setup Wizard enables the MS-CHAP (for Windows 
Server 2003 only), MS-CHAP v2, and EAP authentication protocols. 
VPN Server Support in Windows Vista 
To configure a computer running Windows XP as a remote access VPN server, press the ALT key to 
display the menu bar, click File, and then click New Incoming Connection. Use the pages of the Allow 
Connections to this Computer wizard to configure incoming connections. 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 415 
VPN Server Support in Windows XP 
You can configure a computer running Windows XP as a remote access VPN server by running the 
Create a New Connection Wizard in the Network Connections folder. On the Network Connection 
Type page of the wizard, click Set up an advanced connection. On the Advanced Connection 
Options page, click Accept incoming connections. These options will cause the computer running 
Windows XP to act as a VPN server. However, the server will support only a single remote access 
connection (dial-up, PPTP, or L2TP/IPsec-based). 
IP Address Assignment and Routing and Remote Access 
The VPN server obtains the IPv4 addresses that it assigns to VPN clients from either a DHCP server or 
a static pool of IPv4 addresses. The type of address that Routing and Remote Access can assign to a 
VPN client can be either an on-subnet address or an off-subnet address. The type of address that you 
use can affect reachability, unless you make additional changes to the routing infrastructure. 
The IPv4 addresses assigned to VPN clients can be from an: 
On-subnet address range 
An address range of an intranet subnet to which the VPN server is attached. The VPN server is 
using an on-subnet address range when it obtains IPv4 addresses for VPN clients from a DHCP 
server or when the manually configured static pool contains IPv4 addresses that are within the 
range of addresses of an attached subnet. 
The advantage to using on-subnet addresses is that they require no changes to routing 
infrastructure. 
Off-subnet address range 
An address range that represents a different subnet that is logically attached to the VPN server. 
The VPN server is using an off-subnet address range when the static pool contains IPv4 addresses 
that are located on a separate subnet. 
The advantage to using off-subnet addresses is that the IPv4 addresses of remote access clients 
are more easily identified when they are connecting and communicating with resources on the 
intranet. However, you must change the routing infrastructure so that the clients are reachable from 
the intranet. 
Obtaining IPv4 Addresses via DHCP 
When configured to obtain IPv4 addresses from a DHCP server, Routing and Remote Access obtains 
10 IPv4 addresses at a time. Routing and Remote Access attempts to obtain the first set of addresses 
when the first remote access client connects, rather than when the Routing and Remote Access service 
starts. Routing and Remote Access uses the first IPv4 address and allocates subsequent addresses to 
clients as they connect. When clients disconnect, Routing and Remote Access can reassign their IPv4 
addresses to other clients. When all 10 of the initial set of addresses are being concurrently used and 
another remote access client attempts a connection, Routing and Remote Access obtains 10 more 
addresses. 
If the DHCP Client service cannot contact a DHCP server, the service returns addresses from the 
Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) range of 169.254.0.0/16 (from 169.254.0.1 through 
169.254.255.254). APIPA addresses are off-subnet addresses that, by default, have no corresponding 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 416 
route in the intranet routing infrastructure. Remote access clients that are assigned an APIPA address 
cannot communicate beyond the remote access server. 
Routing and Remote Access attempts to obtain DHCP-allocated addresses using the interface that you 
specify by opening the properties of the server running Routing and Remote Access, clicking the IPv4 
or IP tab, and clicking the name of the interface in Adapter, as Figure 14-7 shows.   
Figure 14-7  The IPv4 tab for the properties of the server running Routing and Remote Access 
You can also specify this adapter on the Network Selection page of the Routing and Remote Access 
Server Setup Wizard (if you have more than one intranet interface). If you specify the wrong adapter, 
attempts to contact the DHCP server using that adapter could fail and return APIPA addresses. If you 
specify Allow RAS to select adapter in Adapter, Routing and Remote Access randomly picks a LAN 
interface to use at startup, which could also result in the use of the wrong adapter. 
When the Routing and Remote Access service is stopped, it sends DHCPRelease messages to release 
all of the IPv4 addresses obtained through DHCP. 
Obtaining IPv4 Addresses from a Static Address Pool 
A static address pool comprises one or more ranges of manually configured IPv4 addresses. When you 
configure a static IPv4 address pool, the VPN server uses the first address in the first range. The server 
allocates subsequent addresses to TCP/IP-based remote access clients as they connect. When the 
clients disconnect, the server can reassign those addresses to other clients. 
An address range in the static IPv4 address pool can be an on-subnet range, an off-subnet range, or a 
mixture of on-subnet and off-subnet addresses.  
If any of the addresses in any of the address ranges are off-subnet, you must add the route or routes 
that summarize those addresses to the intranet routing infrastructure. This step helps ensure that traffic 
destined to remote access clients is forwarded to the VPN server, which forwards the traffic to the 
appropriate client. To provide the best summarization of address ranges for routes, you should choose 
address ranges that you can express using a single address prefix. For example, the address range 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 417 
192.168.2.1 through 192.168.2.254 can be expressed as 192.168.2.0 with the subnet mask 
255.255.255.0 (192.168.2.0/24). 
The Process for Setting Up a Remote Access VPN Connection 
The creation of a remote access VPN connection occurs in the following three steps: 
1. Logical link setup 
Creates the point-to-point link between the client and the server for the purposes of sending PPP 
frames. The logical link used for VPN connections is the VPN tunnel that represents a logical point-
to-point link. If the client is running Windows, the message that appears during the logical link setup 
is "Connecting." 
2. PPP connection setup 
Uses PPP protocols to negotiate the parameters of the PPP link, authenticate the credentials of the 
remote access user, and negotiate the use of and the parameters for the protocols that will operate 
over the PPP link. If the client is running Windows, the message that appears during the PPP 
connection setup is "Verifying user name and password." 
3. Remote access VPN client registration 
The client obtains additional configuration parameters and registers itself in the Domain Name 
System (DNS) and the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) for name resolution. If the client is 
running Windows, the message that appears during the remote access client registration is 
"Registering your computer on the network." 
Step 1: Logical Link Setup 
The process for the logical link setup depends on whether the VPN connection is using PPTP or 
L2TP/IPsec. 
PPTP-based connections are established in the following two phases: 
Phase 1 
The client initiates a TCP connection from a dynamically allocated TCP port to TCP port 1723 on 
the remote access VPN server. 
Phase 2 
The remote access VPN client and the server exchange a series of PPTP messages to negotiate 
the use of a PPTP tunnel and a specific call identifier (ID) for the connection, which is used in the 
PPTP GRE header. 
When the PPTP connection setup begins, the client must already be connected to the Internet. If the 
client is not connected, the user can create a dial-up connection to an ISP before initiating the PPTP 
connection. 
L2TP/IPsec-based connections are established in the following two phases: 
Phase 1 
The IPsec security associations (SAs) needed to protect IPsec-based communications and data are 
negotiated and created. IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol to negotiate the IKE 
Chapter 14 – Virtual Private Networking 
TCP/IP Fundamentals for Microsoft Windows  
Page: 418 
main mode and quick mode SAs. The main mode SA protects IPsec negotiations. The quick mode 
SAs—one for inbound packets and one for outbound packets—protect L2TP data using UDP port 
1701. The main mode SA is authenticated using either certificates or a preshared key.  
For certificate authentication, the VPN server sends the VPN client a list of acceptable root 
certification authorities (CAs) from which the server will accept a certificate for authentication. The 
VPN client responds with a certificate chain (ending at a root CA certificate for a root CA from the 
list that the server sent) and its own list of acceptable root CAs. The server verifies the certificate 
chain of the client and then sends its own certificate chain (ending at a root CA certificate for a root 
CA from the list that the client sent) to the client. The client verifies the certificate chain that the 
server sent.  
For preshared key authentication, both the client and the server send a hash value that 
incorporates the value of the preshared key. The server verifies the hash value that the client sent, 
and the client verifies the hash value that the server sent. 
For more information about main mode and quick mode negotiations, see Chapter 13, "Internet 
Protocol Security and Packet Filtering." 
Phase 2 
The client and the server exchange a series of L2TP messages to negotiate the use of an L2TP 
tunnel and a specific call ID to identify a connection within the L2TP tunnel. 
When the L2TP/IPsec connection setup begins, the client must already be connected to the Internet. If
