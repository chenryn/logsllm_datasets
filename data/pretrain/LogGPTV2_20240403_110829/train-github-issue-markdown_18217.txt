For per-1.0 version, linear progress component has a consistent API with
circle progress component, where the range of the progress can be set with
'max' and 'min' props. These APIs have been removed in 1.0, but it wasn't
explicitly stated, and it was only implied in the examples that the value
props linear progress now takes should be between 0 and 100. This causes a
little confusing and unnecessary digging for those who migrated from pre 1.0
or new users who try to use both progress components.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Linear Progress and Circle Progress to have a consistent API implementation
(with or without 'max/min' props')
## Current Behavior
Linear Progress only takes value prop, while Circle Progress accepts max/min.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
Use a simple component like this one below.
` `
If I start with a total seconds > 100, I would not see the linear progress bar
moving until the last two minutes.
## Context
I am trying to give user different views that use different progress bars.
