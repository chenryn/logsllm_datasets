### Campaigns, Domains, and Affiliate Programs

The relationship between campaigns and the domains they use can be intricate. A single domain may be utilized in multiple campaigns, and a campaign may cycle through several domains over time. Beyond this, there is an additional layer of structure: affiliate programs. Today, spammers primarily operate as advertisers, collaborating with affiliate programs and earning commissions (typically 30-50%). These affiliate programs handle website design, payment processing, customer service, and fulfillment [33].

The prior Click Trajectories measurement effort [18] identified 45 leading affiliate programs specializing in pharmaceutical sales, replica luxury goods, and "OEM" software. This classification includes all major players in each category that advertise via spam. We use the results from this project to define the tagged domains (Section 4.1). Here, we explore the tags themselves, specifically the affiliate programs associated with these domains. We consider the coverage of each feed with respect to affiliate programs.

Figure 4 illustrates the proportion of programs covered by each feed, relative to other feeds and all feeds combined. The representation is similar to Figure 2, where each cell indicates the number of programs represented by the two feeds given.

### Proportionality in Anti-Spam Systems

An effective anti-spam system aims to identify as many spam messages as possible. In this context, volume is a natural measure of a domain's importance. A blacklist that identifies the top 100 spammed domains by volume will catch more spam than a list of the same size consisting of infrequent domains. Similarly, domain takedowns should prioritize high-volume domains. To make these judgments, a spam domain feed must include not only the domains but also their observed volume.

Some of our feeds provide volume information, listing each domain with the number of times it was seen in spam, allowing for the estimation of relative domain volume and rank. This section focuses on feeds with volume information; the Hyb, Hu, dbl, and uribl feeds are excluded as they lack volume data.

### Empirical Domain Distribution and Rank

The volumes associated with each domain define an empirical distribution. If a domain \( i \) has a reported volume \( c_i \) in a feed, the empirical domain probability distribution is \( \frac{c_i}{m} \), where \( m \) is the total volume of the feed (i.e., \( m = \sum_i c_i \)).

### Variation Distance

Variation distance, also known as statistical difference, is a straightforward metric used to compare distributions. Formally, given two probability distributions (feeds) \( P \) and \( Q \), let \( p_i \) be the empirical probability of domain \( i \) in \( P \), and \( q_i \) the probability of the same domain in \( Q \). If a domain does not occur in a feed, its empirical probability is 0. The variation distance is given by:

\[
\delta = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i |p_i - q_i|
\]

Variation distance ranges from 0 to 1, where \( \delta = 0 \) if and only if \( P = Q \) (domains have the same probability in both), and \( \delta = 1 \) if \( P \) and \( Q \) are disjoint (no domains in common). Figure 7 shows pairwise measures of variation distance of tagged domains.

### Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient

Variation distance places more weight on frequently occurring domains. In some cases, only the relative ranks of domains are of interest, not the magnitudes of the empirical probabilities. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient (Kendallâ€™s tau-b) allows us to compare the relative ranking of domains between two distributions. For distinct probabilities,

\[
\tau = \frac{1}{n(n - 1)} \sum_{i \neq j} \text{sgn}((p_i - p_j)(q_i - q_j))
\]

where \( \text{sgn}(x) \) is the signum function. The sum is over all domains common to both feeds, and \( n \) is the number of such domains. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 0 indicating no correlation, 1 indicating perfect positive correlation, and -1 indicating perfect negative correlation. If there are ties, the denominator \( n(n - 1) \) must be adjusted to maintain the range between -1 and 1.

Figure 8 shows the pairwise tagged domain Kendall rank correlation coefficient between all feed pairs.

### Pairwise Comparison

Figures 7 and 8 show how well each pair of feeds agree in domain volume and rank. Qualitatively, both variation distance and Kendall rank correlation coefficient show similar results. The MX honeypot feeds and the Ac1 honey account feeds exhibit similar domain distributions, with many domains in common as seen in Figure 2.

The Bot feed brings a small number of significant domains, many of which also occur in the MX honeypot feeds and the Ac1 feed. In terms of domain proportions, the mx3 feed is more like the Bot feed than any other feed, including the remaining MX honeypots.

### Comparison to Real Mail

In Section 4.2.2, we reported on the fraction of incoming spam, as seen by a major web mail provider, covered by each feed. Here, we use the same incoming mail oracle to determine the real-world relative volumes of spam domains and compare those numbers to the relative domain volumes reported by each feed. We use only tagged domains appearing in at least one spam feed in the comparison, setting \( p_i = 0 \) for any domain not appearing in the union of all spam feeds.

The Mail column in Figures 7 and 8 shows these results. The mx2 feed comes closest to approximating the domain volume distribution of live mail, with Ac1 close behind. The Ac2 feed stands out as being most unlike the rest.

### Timing

For both spammers and blacklist maintainers, timing is critical. Spammers aim to maximize message delivery before a domain is blacklisted, while blacklist maintainers strive to identify and blacklist spam domains quickly.

We consider how well each spam feed captures the timing of spam campaigns, identifying how quickly each feed lists spam domains and, for feeds driven by live mail, how accurately they identify the end of a spam campaign. We restrict our analysis to tagged domains due to their reliable provenance.

Ideally, we would compare the time a domain first appears in spam with the time it first appears in a spam feed. Lacking this perfect knowledge, we take the earliest appearance time of a domain across all feeds as the campaign start time and the last appearance time of a domain in live mail-based feeds as the campaign end time. The Bot feed is excluded due to its limited overlap with other feeds.

### First Appearance Time

Figure 9 shows the distribution of relative first appearance times of domains in each feed. Both Hu and dbl are excellent early warnings of spam campaigns, seeing most domains soon after they appear. The Hu feed sees over 75% of the domains within a day after they appear in any feed, and 95% within three days; dbl is even faster, with over 95% appearing on the blacklist within a day. In contrast, the other feeds have much later first appearance times, not seeing roughly half of the domains until two days have passed, 75% until after four days, and 95% after ten days.

### Last Appearance Time

Figure 11 shows the distribution of differences between the domain lifetime estimated using each feed and the domain campaign duration computed from an aggregate of those same five feeds. The solid lines are medians, and the boxes range from the 25th to the 75th percentile.

### Duration

Figure 12 shows the differences in time durations of domains advertised in spam as observed by each feed relative to the estimated campaign duration. The duration estimates across feeds are similar, differing from the baseline by less than a day for half of the domains and roughly a day for 75% of the domains. The distribution tails are longer, with outliers underestimating durations by multiple weeks.

### Conclusion

Most measurement studies aim to infer new facts about the world. However, occasionally, the goal is to evaluate the quality and consistency of different data sources. This study provides insights into the coverage, volume, and timing of spam domains across various feeds, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each.
