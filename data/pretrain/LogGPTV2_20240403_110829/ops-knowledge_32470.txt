Assistant: The remote access and operation of the server can be realized by using remote login protocols (such as SSH, Telnet, etc.). Among them, SSH is a more secure remote login protocol than Telnet, which can provide encryption, authentication and data integrity guarantee. a little better. For example: log in to the cloud server, manage and operate the cloud server, etc.
