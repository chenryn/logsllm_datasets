FingerBank - open DHCP fingerprints
database
no it's not about a bank of fingers...
Presentation Plan

Device fingerprinting reminder
Identifies software or hardware components
Various types
Operating Systems
Devices
Browsers
Web Server
Web Applications
Two approaches of gathering
fingerprints
Active
Pros: On demand
Cons: Detectable, sometimes intrusive
Passive
Pros: Stealth
Cons: not on demand
Passive fingerprinting reminder
Networks are really noisy
Some protocols use broadcast
Just wait for the goods to come to you
LAN fingerprinting
mDNS, TCP, ARP, DHCP, ...
WAN fingerprinting
honeypots
DHCP Fingerprinting reminder
The pervasiveness and broadcast nature of DHCP makes it compelling
IP Helpers (UDP Helper Address) makes it very easy to collect centrally
Rarely spoofed
DHCP Fingerprinting reminder
(contd.)
DHCP Elements to fingerprint
DHCP retransmission timing (actual vs in packet)
IP TTL on DHCP packets
DHCP Options (55: requested parameters, 60: vendor id, ...)
Number and order of option 55 is particularly precise and interesting
Defensive Use Cases
Easy Operating System Inventory
Even more powerful if IP-Helpers use DHCP Option 82
NAC integration to blacklist end-of-life OS
ex: Win 2000 and earlier
NAC integration to automatically allow dumb devices (shh!)
Offensive Use Cases
Stealth LAN Recon!
...
Any other ideas?
Why FingerBank?
There are User-Agent databases out there
There are snort signature databases out there
What about DHCP Fingerprints?
Consolidate information hidden in silos
Regroup communities that would benefit from sharing this information
Raise awareness about this easy to use technique
What is FingerBank?
A website dedicated to sharing DHCP fingerprint and tools.
Two extensive DHCP fingerprint databases (PacketFence, Satori)
DHCP fingerprinting tools
Mailing list
Who's backing FingerBank?
Eric Kollman - Satori
David LaPorte - PacketFence founder
Olivier Bilodeau - PacketFence lead developer
FingerBank's future
Based on community participation
Improve fingerprint sharing tools
Consolidate data formats
Room for new tools
a pentester oriented one
Support and share about new passive fingerprint types?
That's it
I hope you enjoyed! See you in the debriefing room.
