# FingerBank: An Open DHCP Fingerprint Database

## Introduction
FingerBank is an open database for DHCP fingerprints, not to be confused with a literal "bank of fingers." This presentation will cover the concept of device fingerprinting, particularly focusing on DHCP fingerprinting, and explore both defensive and offensive use cases. We will also introduce FingerBank, its future, and who I am.

## Device Fingerprinting Overview
Device fingerprinting is a technique used to identify software or hardware components. It can be applied to various types of devices and systems, including:

- Operating Systems
- Devices
- Browsers
- Web Servers
- Web Applications

### Approaches to Gathering Fingerprints
There are two primary methods for gathering fingerprints:

1. **Active Fingerprinting**
   - **Pros**: On-demand, provides detailed information.
   - **Cons**: Detectable and potentially intrusive.

2. **Passive Fingerprinting**
   - **Pros**: Stealthy, non-intrusive.
   - **Cons**: Not on-demand, relies on available data.

### Passive Fingerprinting
Networks are inherently noisy, and some protocols use broadcast mechanisms. By passively listening to network traffic, we can gather valuable information without being detected. Examples of passive fingerprinting include:

- **LAN Fingerprinting**: mDNS, TCP, ARP, DHCP, etc.
- **WAN Fingerprinting**: Honeypots

### DHCP Fingerprinting
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is pervasive and uses broadcast, making it an ideal candidate for fingerprinting. Key elements to consider in DHCP fingerprinting include:

- **DHCP Retransmission Timing**: Actual vs. in-packet timing.
- **IP TTL on DHCP Packets**.
- **DHCP Options**:
  - Option 55: Requested parameters.
  - Option 60: Vendor ID.
  - The number and order of option 55 are particularly precise and interesting.

## Defensive Use Cases
1. **Easy Operating System Inventory**: Helps in maintaining an up-to-date inventory of operating systems.
2. **NAC Integration**:
   - **Blacklist End-of-Life OS**: Automatically block outdated systems like Windows 2000 and earlier.
   - **Automatically Allow Dumb Devices**: Simplify network access for IoT and other simple devices.

## Offensive Use Cases
1. **Stealth LAN Recon**: Gather information about network devices without detection.
2. **Other Ideas**: [Open for discussion]

## Why FingerBank?
While there are existing databases for User-Agent strings and Snort signatures, there is a need for a dedicated DHCP fingerprint database. FingerBank aims to:

- Consolidate information currently hidden in silos.
- Regroup communities that would benefit from sharing this information.
- Raise awareness about this easy-to-use technique.

## What is FingerBank?
FingerBank is a website dedicated to sharing DHCP fingerprints and tools. It includes:

- Two extensive DHCP fingerprint databases (PacketFence, Satori).
- DHCP fingerprinting tools.
- A mailing list for community discussions.

## Who's Backing FingerBank?
- **Eric Kollman**: Satori.
- **David LaPorte**: PacketFence founder.
- **Olivier Bilodeau**: PacketFence lead developer.

## FingerBank's Future
The future of FingerBank is based on community participation. Our goals include:

- Improving fingerprint sharing tools.
- Consolidating data formats.
- Developing new tools, especially those oriented towards pentesters.
- Supporting and sharing information about new passive fingerprint types.

## About Me
- **Olivier Bilodeau**: System architect at Inverse Inc., PacketFence lead developer since 2009, and InfoSec instructor at a Montreal university.
- Personal Interests: New father, Open Source enthusiast, CTF participant, Android developer, and home brewer.
