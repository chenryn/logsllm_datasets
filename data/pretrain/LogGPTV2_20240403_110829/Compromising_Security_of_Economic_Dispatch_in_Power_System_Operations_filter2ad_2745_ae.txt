TTRLine). Only three nodes are shown. If our objective
is to look for line rating 0x3FC00000, its corresponding
pattern predicate will encode the offset to get the node’s initial
member value 0x05E50000 that points to the next node
shown (summarized) on the top of the ﬁgure. The second
element of each node (0x04F50000 in the top node) points to
the previous node. A relatively more complex second-degree
predicate would be “*(*(*(*(candidate addr - 0x1033C0))
+ 0x04)+ 0x04) == candidate addr - 0x1033C0”,
i.e.,
A Ñ next Ñ next Ñ previous Ñ previous ““ A,
where A represents the data structure that stores the line rating
0x3FC00000.
The attack payload checks for patterns on the identiﬁed
candidates before corrupting their values. The code searches
for the speciﬁc value in memory, and modiﬁes the identiﬁed
candidate. Table III shows how many hits our implementation
ﬁnds for individual target power system parameter values on
PowerWorld memory space. The number empirically proves
the infeasibility of memory corruption attacks without the use
of signature predicates. The next column shows how well
the signatures dismiss the irrelevant candidates and identify
the true target values. Table IV shows the forensics analysis
accuracy for ﬁve different EMS software packages. Through
the use of the code pointer signatures and its extracted knowl-
edge about the class hierarchies, our implementation was able
to correctly recognize the class types of all object instances
within the EMS memory. The payload initializes the OPF al-
gorithm in its corresponding thread. Once it changes the iden-
tiﬁed memory addresses, it restarts the control loop through
the call to CreateThread function within kernel32.dll
that is loaded by almost all windows processes.
B. Case-study Demonstration
As a concrete example, we show how the state of underlying
power system (the same model used in Section IV) gets
affected once the memory corruption is completed (Figure 84).
Before the corruption (Figure 8a), the EMS GUI visualizes the
safe state of power system operation, where the transmission
lines are mostly fully utilized; however, no line rating (ca-
pacity constraints) are violated. The optimal attack generation
algorithm computes the adversary-optimal values for the line
ratings, and chooses to i) modify the B1 ´ B3 transmission
line to 120M W from 150M W ; and ii) modify the line rating
for the B2´ B3 transmission line to 240M W from 150M W .
While implementing the optimal attacker strategies that we
obtain from the maximin solution, we need to translate the
line rating values to higher values using basic power ﬂow
4The pie charts on the transmission lines represent the used percentages of
the line power ﬂow capacities in that particular state.

attack on Powertools [1] package. In this scenario, the attacker
changed the line rating for two of the branches as shown
in Figure 8c. Similar to the PowerWorld case, the exploit
locates the sensitive parameters (line ratings) and modiﬁes
them during the program execution. As the result, the memory
corruption impacted the power ﬂow iterations of DC-OPF
performed by the Powertools software that consumed the
modiﬁed memory regions, and made it converge to a different
wrong value. In terms of the attack implementation approach,
the attacks against PowerWorld and powertools were identical.
VII. DISCUSSIONS AND POTENTIAL MITIGATION
Our attack and similar domain-speciﬁc memory data cor-
ruption attacks can be mitigated through several potential
solutions: i) Protection of sensitive data: ﬁne-grained data
isolation mechanisms such as hardware supported Intel SGX
can be leveraged to store and process sensitive data such as
power system parameters within protection enclave regions.
This protects sensitive data against access requests by other
irrelevant instructions in the same memory space. A more
ﬁne-grained version of such memory-based data protection can
distinguish between data that are often ﬁxed during the opera-
tion (e.g., power system topological information) vs. regularly
updated data regions (e.g., sensor measurements) to facilitate
lower-overhead protection such as read-only memory pages
for the ﬁxed data once they are loaded on memory initially.
ii) Control command veriﬁcation: controller output veriﬁcation
mechanisms such as an extended version of TSV [19] can be
used to ensure the safety of the (maliciously) issued control
commands by an infected control system software before they
are allowed to reach the actuators. Monitoring of the control
channel, however, does not ensure the correct functionality
of the control system software. Instead it
just ensures its
outputs (even though corrupted) are within the safety margins
of the physical plant. iii) Intrusion-tolerant replication: a more
traditional approach is to use redundancy such as N-version
programming by maintaining a redundant controller software
that is different from the main one used. The replica controller
can monitor the dynamic behavior of the physical plant (e.g.,
power system) as well as the main controller’s output
to
the actuators. The replica can rerun the control algorithm to
calculate and compare its calculated control outputs with those
of the main controller. Hence, the main controller infection
(misbehavior) can be identiﬁed if a mismatch is detected;
iv) Algorithmic redundancy: Carefully designed algorithmic
tools (e.g., attack-aware optimal dispatch) can provide safe
operating regimes to limit the impact of successful attacks.
Indeed, this is a topic of future research.
VIII. RELATED WORK
We review the most related recent work on control system
security. The existing solutions to protect the control networks’
trusted computing base (TCB) are insufﬁcient as software
patches are often applied only months after release [22], and
new vulnerabilities are discovered on a regular basis [21], [28].
The traditional perimeter-security tries to keep adversaries out
of the protected control system entirely. Attempts include
regulatory compliance approaches such as the NERC CIP

calculations. For example, for the implementation of optimal
attack, we usepu13 “ 120 M V A andpu23 “ 240 M V A. These
values are higher than the values pu13 “ 100 and pu23 “ 200
calculated by the bilevel optimization.
This increase in optimal line rating manipulations is neces-
sary to account for the fact that the AC OPF implementation
is constrained by the line rating bounds on apparent power
ﬂows (with both real and reactive power components) while
the optimal attack generation procedure calculates manipulated
line rating assuming that only real power ﬂows are subject to
line ratings. As the consequence, the power system enters an
unsafe state after the OPF control algorithm uses the corrupted
line ratings and hence produces wrong control outputs to the
power generators; see Figure 8b. Optimal and physics-aware
corruption of the sensitive values through a controller attack
allows the intruders to maximize the physical impact on the
power system operations without having to compromise a
large number of sensors as required in false data injection
attacks. We also performed the same memory data corruption

[34] A. J. Wood and B. F. Wollenberg. Power generation, operation, and
requirements [31] and access control [11]. Despite the promise
of information-security approaches, thirty years of precedence
have shown the near impossibility of keeping adversaries out
of critical systems [13] and less than promising results for
the prospect of addressing the security problem from the
perimeter [14], [15], [20]. Embedded controller software from
most major vendors [14], [32] and popular human machine
interfaces [20] have been shown to have fundamental security
ﬂaws. Ofﬂine control veriﬁcation solutions [19] implement
formal methods using symbolic execution of the controller
program to verify the safety of the code before it is let execute
on the controller device. Not surprisingly, those methods face
scalability problem, caused by state-space explosion.
One speciﬁc related line of research is proposed false
data injection (FDI) attacks [17], [30], [33] that have been
explored over the past few years. FDI assumes compromised
set of sensors and make them send corrupted measurements to
electricity grid control centers to mislead the state estimation
procedures. The authors propose a system observability [17]
analysis to determine the required minimal subset of com-
promised sensors to evade the electricity grid’s bad data
detection algorithms [18]. The power system stability has also
been studied under corrupted real-time pricing signals [29].
As a fundamental domain-speciﬁc monitoring tool for cyber-
physical platforms, state estimation is to ﬁt sensor data to a
system model and determine the current state [2], [3]. Existing
real-world solutions to analyze power system stability [12]
run every few minutes [25]. These solution do not consider
the cyber-side controllers and/or adversarial settings [4], [34];
hence they may miss malicious incidents such as the con-
troller code execution attacks. Risk assessment techniques,
e.g., contingency what-if analyses [27] investigate potential
power system failures speculatively. However, enumeration of
all possible incidents is a combinatorial problem and does not
scale up efﬁciently in practical settings [7].
