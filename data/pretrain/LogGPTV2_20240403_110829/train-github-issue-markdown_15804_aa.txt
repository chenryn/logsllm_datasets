## Questions and Help

Hello,

I am new to PyTorch and I am trying to install PyTorch with ROCm. I followed the steps outlined in the documentation [here](https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Deep_learning/Deep-learning.html#building-pytorch-for-rocm).

When I run the command `PYTORCH_TEST_WITH_ROCM=1 python test/run_test.py --verbose`, I expect all tests to pass, but I encountered some errors. Below is a snippet of the output:

```plaintext
Test executor: ['/usr/bin/python']
Excluding cpp_extensions on ROCm
Excluding distributed on ROCm
Excluding multiprocessing on ROCm
Excluding multiprocessing_spawn on ROCm
Selected tests: autograd, c10d, c10d_spawn, cuda, cuda_primary_ctx, dataloader, distributions, docs_coverage, expecttest, fake_quant, indexing, jit, logging, mkldnn, nccl, nn, numba_integration, optim, qat, quantization, quantized, quantized_tensor, quantized_nn_mods, quantizer, sparse, torch, type_info, type_hints, utils, namedtuple_return_api, jit_fuser, tensorboard, namedtensor, type_promotion, jit_disabled, function_schema
Running test_autograd ... [2019-10-28 03:37:35.924929]
test___getitem__ (__main__.TestAutograd) ... ok
...
(test results continue)
...
test_diagonal_2d_2 (__main__.TestAutograd) ... ok
```

The tests that were excluded or skipped include:
- `cpp_extensions`
- `distributed`
- `multiprocessing`
- `multiprocessing_spawn`

Additionally, I received a warning during the test execution:
```plaintext
/root/pytorch/torch/csrc/autograd/python_function.cpp:622: UserWarning: Legacy autograd function with non-static forward method is deprecated and will be removed in 1.3. Please use new-style autograd function with static forward method. (Example: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/autograd.html#torch.autograd.Function)
```

Can you please help me understand why these tests are being excluded and how to resolve the warning? Thank you.

Best regards,
