#### Presenter: Brad (theNURSE) Smith, RN, Informatics Specialist in Private Practice

#### Introduction to Psychoacoustics
**What is Psychoacoustics?**
- **Definition:** Psychoacoustics is the study of how sound affects the brain and human perception.
- **Key Concepts:** Unlike Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), psychoacoustics focuses on the use of specific sounds to influence brain states.

#### Historical Context
- **Heinrich Wilhelm Dove:** A 19th-century German physicist who discovered binaural beats, a foundational concept in psychoacoustics.
- **Climatologist's Role:** While not directly related to psychoacoustics, climatologists have contributed to the understanding of environmental soundscapes.

#### Types of Psychoacoustic Sounds
- **Binaural Beats:** Created by playing two slightly different frequencies in each ear, leading to a perceived third tone.
- **Monaural Beats:** Similar to binaural beats but created with a single audio source.
- **Isochronic Tones:** Pulsed tones that can be heard through speakers or headphones.

#### Physiological Effects of Psychoacoustic Sounds
- **Music and Premature Babies:** A Canadian research team found that music can reduce pain and improve oral feeding in premature infants. [Source: BBC News](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/8068749.stm)

#### Frequency and Brainwave States
- **Gamma (40 Hz):** Associated with insight and "Aha" moments.
- **Beta (13-40 Hz):** Characterized by active, busy, or anxious thinking and concentration.
- **Alpha (8-13 Hz):** Linked to relaxation while awake.
- **Theta (4-7 Hz):** Related to dreams, deep meditation, and hypnosis.
- **Delta (<4 Hz):** Associated with deep, dreamless sleep.

#### Software and Tools for Psychoacoustics
- **Gnaural:** Open-source software for generating binaural beats.
- **BrainStimPro Binaural Brainwave Generator:** A tool for creating and customizing binaural beats.
- **Audacity / Lame:** Free, open-source audio editing software.
- **Binaural:** Another software option for generating binaural beats.

#### Key Points
- **Tones Affect Your Brain:** Different frequencies can induce various mental states.
- **Lower Tones Synchronize with Moods:** Lower frequency tones often align with deeper, more relaxed states.
- **Duration Matters:** Longer exposure to these sounds can enhance their effects.
- **Samples on DVD:** Provided for further exploration.

#### Future Work and Research
- **Current Songs and Psychoacoustics:** Investigate whether modern music incorporates these techniques.
- **Vegas Hypothesis:** Explore the use of psychoacoustic techniques in Las Vegas casinos.
- **Phone Vomit:** Study the effects of unpleasant sounds on phone calls.
- **Suggestions:** Open to feedback and new ideas.
