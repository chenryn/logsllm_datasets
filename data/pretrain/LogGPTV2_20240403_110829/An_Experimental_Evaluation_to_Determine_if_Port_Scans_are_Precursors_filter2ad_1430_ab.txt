### Nessus Vulnerability Scanner and Traffic Analysis

Nessus, developed by Tenable Network Security, was configured with over 4,000 plugins, including those labeled as "dangerous" (i.e., capable of causing DoS attacks). The scanner was deployed on the same isolated network as described in Section 5.1. All network traffic was captured using Ethereal version 0.10.7 [20]. The captured packets from grouped connections were exported to a database and correlated by the number of packets per connection.

#### Packet Analysis
Figures 3a and 3b present the results of the number of packets per connection and the number of connections associated with a given number of packets, both with and without the port scan module enabled. Notably, no connections were observed with specific numbers of packets (e.g., 5, 14, 15).

- **Without the Port Scan Module:**
  - 0.053% of vulnerability scans consisted of four or fewer packets per connection.
  - 98.641% of the connections had six packets, which were identified as half-reversed port scans repeated three times.

- **With the Port Scan Module:**
  - 0.0485% of vulnerability scans consisted of four or fewer packets per connection.
  - 98.815% of the connections had six packets, also identified as half-reversed port scans repeated three times.

These results suggest that a threshold of five or fewer packets is effective for differentiating port scans from vulnerability scans. However, the observation of 4,024 connections consisting of six packets requires a reassessment of the five-packet threshold. A script was developed to identify these port scans and count them as special half-reversed port scans with two-packet connections.

#### Data Filtering and Analysis
Data collection spanned forty-eight days on a test bed at the University of Marylandâ€™s Institute for Systems Research. The test bed included two target computers running Windows 2000 with identical services and vulnerabilities. Twenty-five vulnerabilities from 2000 to 2004 were selected to cover various services and criticality levels.

**Traffic Filtering:**
- **Data Collection Level:** 
  - A machine in bridge mode with two network interfaces was used, one connected to the firewall and the other to the target computers' network.
  - Only external data from the Internet directed to the target computers was routed over this bridge.
  - A third management interface was used to separate management traffic from attack traffic.

- **Data Parsing:**
  - Collected data was parsed into a MySQL-compatible format.
  - Management traffic (e.g., STP, DNS, NTP) and non-targeted traffic were filtered out.

**Collected Traffic Summary:**
- Total Packets Captured: 908,963
- Distinct TCP and ICMP Connections: 59,468
- TCP Connections to Target Computer 1: 5,776
- ICMP Connections to Target Computer 1: 7,203
- TCP Connections to Target Computer 2: 7,274
- ICMP Connections to Target Computer 2: 2,457

**Data Analysis:**
- Scripts were developed to categorize the 22,710 collected connections into ICMP scans, port scans, vulnerability scans, and attacks.
- **Classification Criteria:**
  - Less than five packets: Port scan
  - Between five and twelve packets: Vulnerability scan (with six-packet connections as special half-reversed port scans)
  - More than twelve packets: Attack

The goal was to analyze the correlation between scans and attacks. Unique scans and attacks from each source IP address were recorded, regardless of the actual number of occurrences.

**Traffic Flows:**
- Figure 5 illustrates the flows of traffic on the test bed.
- Figure 7 shows the distribution of malicious activity into unique ICMP scans, port scans, vulnerability scans, and attacks.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the network traffic patterns and helps in distinguishing between different types of malicious activities.
