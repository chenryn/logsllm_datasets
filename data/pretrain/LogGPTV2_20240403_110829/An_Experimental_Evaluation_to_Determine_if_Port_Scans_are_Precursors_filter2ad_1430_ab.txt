with more than 4,000 plug-ins enabled in addition to the 
plug-ins  characterized  as  “dangerous”  (i.e.,  leading  to
DoS attacks) on the same isolated network as in Section 
5.1 and recorded all packets going through the network
using Ethereal version 0.10.7 [20]. Ethereal captured the
packets
from  grouped 
connections. The files were exported into a database and
correlated  by  number  of  packets  per  connection.  Figure
3a  and  3b  provide  the  results of the number of packets
per connection and the number of connections associated
with  a  given  number  of  packets when running NeWT
without and with the port scan module. Note that we did
not  observe  any  connection  with  some specific number
of  packets  (e.g.,  5,  14,  15).  From  Figure  3a  and  3b,
0.053%  (without  the  port  scan  module) and 0.0485%
(with the  port  scan  module) of  the  vulnerability  scans 
consist of four or less packets per connection. This result
shows  that  the  threshold  of  five  or  less packets is
relevant to  differentiate  port  scans  from  vulnerability
scans.  However,  note  that 4,024 connections consisting

of  six  packets  are  port  scans.  This observation requires
reassessing the use of five packets as a threshold for port
scans. When analyzing these six packet connections, we 
observed that they consisted of half reversed port scans
performed three times. We developed a script to identify
these port scans and counted them as special half reverse 
port scans with a connection of two packets.

Figure 3b. Nessus: Analysis of the Number of Packets 
per Connection With the Port Scans Module 
From Figure 3a  and  3b,  99.91%  (without  the  port
scan module) and 99.92% (with the port scan module) of 
the  vulnerability  scans  consist  of  connections having
between  six  and  twelve  packets.  And  only 0.03% (with
and without the port  scan  module)  of  the  vulnerability 
scans  consist  of  connections  having  more than twelve
packets.  Based  on  these  experimental  results  and  since
an  individual  characterization  of the vulnerability plug-
ins  would  be  fastidious,  we  decided to characterize
vulnerability  scans  as  connections  having  between  five 
and  twelve  packets  (besides  six  packet  connections
recognized  as  half  reverse  port  scans  repeated three
times that are counted as special half reverse port scans).
Connections with less than five packets are characterized
as  port  scans.  Connections  with  more  than  twelve
packets are characterized as attacks.
6. Data Filtering and Data Analysis 
We collected data during  forty-eight  days  on  a  test
bed  consisting  of  two  target  computers deployed at the
University of Maryland’s Institute for Systems Research.
The selected subnet is  an  unmonitored  subnet  in  which
IP  addresses  are  dynamically  assigned  to users. Both
target  computers  ran  Windows  2000  and  had  the same
services  (i.e.,  IIS,  FTP,  Telnet,  NetTime  [26])  and  the
same vulnerabilities  maintained  during  the  whole  data
collection.  Twenty-five  vulnerabilities  from  2000  to
2004, shown in Figure 4, were selected to cover various
services and different levels of criticality. Note that most
UDP traffic is filtered at the gateway level on the chosen
subnet by the campus  security  administrators  (which  is
the  reason  why  the  experiment  focuses  on ICMP and
TCP  traffic).  The  number  of  outbound traffic was
limited: 10  TCP  connections  per  hour,  15  ICMP
connections per hour and 15 other connections per hour. 
Moreover,  the  target  computers  were  re-imaged twice
during the experiment.
6.1  Data Filtering
As mentioned in Section 4, the traffic data collected
was  filtered  at  multiple  stages  before  being  analyzed.
Figure 5 indicates the different flows of traffic. Filtering
is  completed  at  the  data  collection  level  by the way we
setup  the  data  collection  engine.  We use a machine
acting in a bridge mode using two network interfaces in 
which one  interface  is  connected  to  the  firewall  and 
other interface to the network of target computers. Only 
external  data  coming  from  the  Internet  and  having as
destination  the  target  computers  are  routed  over  this
bridge  (i.e.,  attack  traffic).  We  use  a  third management
interface
to  our 
management network so  that  all  the  communication  to
and from  the  management  network  is  routed  over  this
third  management 
subsequently
separated from the attack traffic. Data is collected using 
Ethereal [20] packet sniffer. The collected data consisted
of  908,963  packets  of  malicious  and  management

traffic  generated  by  the  bridge,  DNS  resolutions  and 
NTP queries. The data is parsed into a format that can be 
stored in a MySQL database. The data is then parsed on 
a protocol basis to filter out the rest of the management
traffic. Moreover,  traffic  not  directed  to  either  target 
computers is filtered out of the dataset. The statistics on

6.2  Data Analysis
To analyze the 22,710 collected connections going to
the  two  target  computers  (i.e.,  attack  traffic),  we
developed scripts to split the data into ICMP scans, port
scans, vulnerability scans and attacks. ICMP scans were 
easily identified  based  on  the  protocol  type.  Port  scans, 
vulnerability  scans  and  attacks  were  split  using the
conclusions of Section 5:
(cid:120)(cid:3) Less than five packets in a connection is defined
as a port scan, 
(cid:120)(cid:3) Between five and twelve packets in a connections
is defined as  a  vulnerability  scan  (besides
connections of six  packets  recognized  as  three
half  reverse  port  scans  are  defined  as  a  special
case of half reverse port scan) and 
(cid:120)(cid:3) More  than  twelve  packets  in  a  connection  is 
defined as an attack. 
The goal of  this  experiment  was  to  analyze  the 
correlation between  scans  and  attacks.  Therefore,  we 
only  kept  unique  scans  and  attacks. For example,
if
multiple port scans were  launched  from  one  specific
source  IP  address  towards  one  of  the  target computers,
we  only  recorded  that  this  source  IP address had
launched  at  least  one  port  scan  without recording the
actual number of port scans. Similarly, if one source IP
address launched several attacks (of the same type or of 
different  types)  against  one  of  the target computers, we
only recorded that at least one attack had been launched
from that source IP address against the target computer.
In Figure 7 the link  between  the  22,710  connections  of 
malicious activity into  unique  ICMP  scans,  port  scans,
vulnerability scans and attacks is shown.
