Machine Learning + Splunk
Machine Learning is Not Magic
 ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a process.
The process starts with a question:
‚Äì How many requests do I expect in the next hour?
‚Äì How likely is this hard drive to fail in the near future?‚Äì Am I being hacked?√™ Is it unexpected for Joe to login to the bastion host at 2am?

7. Save the learned model.
Serialize model settings, coefficients, etc. into a Splunk lookup table.
‚Ä¢ Replicated amongst members of Search Head Cluster.‚Ä¢ Automatically distributed to Indexers with search bundle.

fit: Properties
 Each event is an ‚Äúexample‚Äù for the learning algorithm.Resilient to missing values.   (but be careful!) 
Automatically handles categorical (e.g. non-numeric) fields.
SAVES ITS WORK:
‚Äì Learned model can be applied to new, unseen data
with the apply command.
27
fit: Scalability
 Some algorithms are inherently not scalable.
‚Äì	e.g. Kernel-based Support Vector Machines is ùëÇ ùëÅ1
Input is sampled using reservoir sampling.
‚Äì	Per-algorithm sample reservoir size, typically 100,000 events‚Äì	Configurable in mlspl.conf.
Some algorithms support incremental fitting, e.g.:
SGDRegressor, SGDClassifier, NaiveBayes
‚Äì	Use ‚Äúpartial_fit=t‚Äù option with fit command.
‚Äì	No sampling, no event limit!
For the most part, you don‚Äôt need to care.
