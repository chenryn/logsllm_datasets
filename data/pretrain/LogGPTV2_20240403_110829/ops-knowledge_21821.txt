Question: "As an Android application developer, you are tasked with ensuring the security of your application's cryptographic features. Considering the evolution of Android Cryptographic APIs, which of the following actions should you take while targeting devices running different API levels?"
 "A": "For devices running Android 7.0 (API level 24) and above, ensure that you are using a patched security provider and avoid specifying a security provider unless required for the Android Keystore system."
 "B": "For devices running Android 8.1 (API level 27) and above, continue using the `IvParameterSpec.class` for GCM mode of operation due to its stable implementation over the years."
 "C": "For devices running Android 10 (API level 29), you can ignore network security changes as they do not significantly impact the cryptographic operations of the application."
 "D": "For devices running Android 9 (API level 28) and above, ignore warnings related to specifying a security provider using the `getInstance` method, as they are merely suggestions, not requirements."
Answer: A
