If you do `make install` with previous installed versions, multiple copies of
all the libraries get left in (for me) `/usr/local/lib/rustc/x86_64-apple-
darwin/lib`. Then the next time you try building something with the installed
rustc, it'll promptly fail with `error: multiple matching crates for core`
