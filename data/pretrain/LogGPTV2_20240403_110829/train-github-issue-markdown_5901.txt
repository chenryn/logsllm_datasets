**Jack Woods** opened **SPR-7895** and provided the following comments:

The custom message converters registered with `AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` are not being utilized. Instead, only the default ones registered with `AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` are in use. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the `setMessageConverters()` method of the `AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter` class is invoked twice: once for the default converters and again for the bean defined in the Spring XML configuration file. However, the converter specified in the Spring XML file is never used during the actual marshalling and unmarshalling processes.

For example, the JiBX message converter defined as follows is not being applied:
```java
// Example of a JiBX message converter that is not being used
```

In my opinion, the JiBX support in Spring OXM is somewhat lacking. To use JiBX with Spring, we must define a separate converter for each target class. This is in contrast to using Jersey with JiBX, where we only need two `@Provider` classes that implement `MessageBodyReader` and `MessageBodyWriter`. For your reference, I have attached the `JIBXBodyReader` and `JIBXBodyWriter` classes.
