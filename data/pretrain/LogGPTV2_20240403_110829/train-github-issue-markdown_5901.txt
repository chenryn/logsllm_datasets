Custom message converters registered with AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter are
not used, only the default ones registered with  are
used. I found that the setMessageConverters() method of
AnnotationMethodHandlerAdapter class is called two times, one for the default
and another one for the bean defined in the spring xml file. The one defined
in the spring xml file is never used when doing actual marshalling and
unmarshalling.
For example the following jibx message converter is not used:
In my opinion the jibx support in Spring OXM is rather poor. We need to define
a separate converter for each target-class. We don't need to do that kind of
thing when using Jersey with Jibx. We just need two `@Provider` classes that
implement MessageBodyReader and MessageBodyWriter. I have attached
JIBXBodyReader and JIBXBodyWriter for your reference.
