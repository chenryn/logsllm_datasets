Support for react-native-web _worked in Next.js 4_ , but now throws an error
when upgrading to Next.js 5. From my research, this would appear to be related
to an issue that has been closed in necolas/react-native-web#364.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The Next.js server should successfully compile and load the application
without errors.
## Current Behavior
The Next.js server throws an error and failed to compile.
    ERROR  Failed to compile with 1 errors
    This dependency was not found:
    * react-dom/unstable-native-dependencies in ./node_modules/react-native-web/dist/modules/injectResponderEventPlugin/index.js
    To install it, you can run: npm install --save react-dom/unstable-native-dependencies
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Spin up Next.js 5 project
  2. `yarn add react-native-web`
  3. `yarn add -D babel-plugin-react-native-web`
  4. Add `.babelrc` configured for the plugin installed in previous step
  5. Setup Next.js with `react-native-web` (see slightly different example below to match latest version of `react-native-web`)
  6. `yarn start`
## Context
The Next.js application is unable to compile.

## Custom Document
    import Document, { Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';
    import React from 'react';
    import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native-web';
    import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server';
    export default class MyDocument extends Document {
      static async getInitialProps({ renderPage }) {
        AppRegistry.registerComponent('Main', () => Main);
        const { getStyleElement } = AppRegistry.getApplication('Main');
        const page = renderPage();
        const styles = [getStyleElement()];
        return { ...page, styles };
      }
      render() {
        return (
        );
      }
    }
