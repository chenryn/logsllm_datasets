authentication servers in each one-hour interval during the week.
There are two main observations evident from Fig. 2. First, prior to the
pandemic (September 2019), authentication traﬃc tended to have two peaks
per day on weekdays, with one peak in the morning, and one in the evening.
This pattern reﬂects users logging in from home (e.g., checking email, accessing
course Web pages) as part of their daily routine both before and after their
time on campus3 for the workday. Second, there is a substantial increase in
authentication traﬃc in September 2020, as a new cohort of students joins the
campus community, and many people are working and learning from home. There
is a single peak to the traﬃc each day, with most authentications happening in
the morning, and some sessions lasting several hours4, if not all day, since there
was no need to logout and commute to/from campus anymore. Weekend traﬃc
is substantially lower than weekday traﬃc, as expected. The weekend peaks
are also time-shifted to slightly later in the morning. The main insight is that
working from home shifts the usage patterns and leads to prolonged sessions with
campus servers.
Figure 3 demonstrates the changes to the number of connections to the
authentication servers, comparing data from September 2019 to September 2020.
Each bubble represents a country and shows the absolute amount of change in the
authentication connection counts. The size of the bubbles is relative to the max-
imum change observed (i.e., increase in connections from Canada). Figure 3(a)
shows the countries whose number of authentication connections increased, while
3 Recall that any additional authentication sessions initiated while on campus would
not be observable from our monitor.
4 The mid-July conﬁguration change to the monitor restart interval (now 6 h) con-
tributes to the observed increase in connections as well.

Fig. 3(b) shows the countries with a decrease in their counts. These maps show
that connection count increases were most prominent from locations in Canada,
followed by the Netherlands, UK, and the US. For connection count decreases,
Hong Kong had the largest change, with Japan, Ukraine, and Indonesia next.
4.4 Learning Management System (LMS)
Figure 4 shows hourly connection counts to our LMS during a week in Septem-
ber 2020 and the corresponding week in September 2019. UCalgary uses D2L
(Desire2Learn) for LMS, and it is hosted in Quebec, Canada. Despite being in
the cloud (AWS), users are redirected to the campus authentication servers at
both the start and the end of LMS sessions, enabling counting of this traﬃc.
Figure 4 shows signiﬁcant changes in LMS traﬃc patterns, similar to those
observed for the authentication traﬃc. In September 2019 (before the pandemic),
students were regularly on campus, so their LMS authentication traﬃc was not
always visible from our monitor. A peak in the evening when most people were
back home is most evident on the green line. When working from home, however,
this traﬃc is more observable throughout the day, as reﬂected in the higher
activity levels in September 2020, with signiﬁcant changes in its pattern. Diurnal
patterns are still evident, with a decline on weekends.
4.5 Remote Access
This subsection discusses the usage of three popular remote access protocols,
namely SSH, VPN, and RDP.
Figure 5(a) illustrates the daily connection counts for these protocols for the
entire calendar year of 2020, while Fig. 5(b) shows the daily byte traﬃc volume
associated with these connections. Note that the vertical axes are logscale (base
10) for better visibility of the entire data. Overall, these results show the domi-
nance of SSH (purple line) in terms of the number of connections (some of which
may be generated by scripts or automated processes), while VPN connections
(orange line) account for the most data bytes. RDP (gold line) has the lowest

activity for both connections and data volumes since it is only applicable for
Windows users, and requires a registered system on campus in order to establish
an RDP connection. Therefore, lower usage for RDP is unsurprising.
Our further investigation revealed that the increase in the number of SSH
connections right before the lockdown is attributable to the increase in inbound
scanning activity. Interestingly, the SSH connection count remains pretty steady
throughout the year and does not exhibit the typical human-driven weekly pat-
terns evident in the VPN traﬃc. However, the SSH data volume did increase
2–5x compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in February, reﬂecting changes to
the monitor’s visibility of this traﬃc after the July conﬁguration change. The 6-h
restart interval improves visibility into long-duration TCP connections (refer to
Appendix). This is important for applications like VPN and SSH, which often
last several hours, if not all day, and it explains the larger proportionate increase
in byte traﬃc volume than in connection count. On our network, SSH usage
seems more research-driven rather than education-driven.
Daily VPN connections and data volume both increased after the lockdown
by a factor of about 10x. This increase occurred almost immediately following
the work-at-home mandate in mid-March 2020. A later increase is also evident in
mid-July 2020, when the change in the monitor conﬁguration enhanced observ-
ability of longer-duration connections. Although there are fewer VPN connec-

tions than SSH, VPN connections tend to have longer durations and transfer
more data bytes than SSH connections. Figure 6 illustrates these eﬀects.
The growth in VPN traﬃc is consistent with observations made by others [5].
For our campus network, the VPN has a broader set of users than the other
remote access protocols, since it is available to the entire community. The VPN
has greater ﬂexibility as well, since traﬃc from multiple network applications
can be transferred via its connection. Therefore, such an increase in VPN usage
is not surprising. In fact, after the lockdown, the primary option to access the
campus network was to use the VPN. Many students returned to their home
cities or countries, and a lot of newly admitted international students had to
commence their programs from abroad. Using the VPN has been the primary
means to facilitate this access.
A separate analysis (not shown here) of the origin cities of VPN connec-
tions conﬁrms that the increased connection count comes from a larger set of
external IPs accessing the network from all over the world. The main insight is
that VPN usage increased dramatically, in terms of connections, data volumes,
session duration, IP addresses, and geographical distribution. Our further inves-
tigations did not ﬁnd any evidence of VPN-related performance degradation on
the campus network or repercussions for the nearby clients.
5 Zoom Measurement Results
This section provides an in-depth look at Zoom network traﬃc, motivated by the
growth and volume of this traﬃc as identiﬁed in the previous section. We begin
with a look at videoconferencing applications to provide a comparison point for
the Zoom traﬃc.
5.1 Videoconferencing Apps
This subsection discusses the network traﬃc measurement results for three online
meeting applications (i.e., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet). Google

Meet is a relatively new video conferencing app launched by Google in 2017.
Prior work indicates that Meet usage increased during the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially after Google relaxed its meeting size constraints for unpaid users [14].
We identify Zoom traﬃc based on the ports and IP ranges5 provided in their
Web site documentation. Similar principles apply to our identiﬁcation of traﬃc
for Teams and Meet. We show graphs of daily connection counts and traﬃc
volume for each of these applications and compare them accordingly.
Figure 7(a) illustrates the daily connection counts for the three applications,
while Fig. 7(b) shows the corresponding daily byte traﬃc volumes for each. Both
plots show the entirety of calendar year 2020, illustrating the traﬃc generated
by on-campus users when accessing these externally-supported applications. The
gaps in the plots are due to the monitor outages mentioned earlier.
Figure 7 shows the emergence of Zoom in our post-secondary learning envi-
ronment in 2020. Prior to the work-at-home order in March 2020, Google Meet
(red line) was the most popular conferencing app, with almost 100K connec-
tions per day. At this time, Zoom (blue line) had only 1K connections per day.
By September 2020, however, Zoom had reached a level of connection activity
comparable to Meet, while far exceeding Meet in data traﬃc volume. Similarly,

Fig. 8. Hourly connections and byte traﬃc volume for Zoom on three selected weeks
in February, July, and September, 2020.
Microsoft Teams traﬃc (green line) grew signiﬁcantly for remote work and learn-
ing after March 2020, and has usage patterns very similar to Zoom.
The number of connections to Google Meet has actually decreased after the
lockdown. One reason is fewer people on campus, and another is that Teams and
Zoom were adopted as the oﬃcial online meeting and conferencing app for our
university. In particular, the total number of Meet connections from July onwards
has decreased by 60–70% with respect to that number in February. However,
the byte traﬃc volume for Google Meet did not decline much at all, suggesting
more prolonged usage. These observations also suggest that a signiﬁcant portion
of connections to Meet are system-generated probes by the Meet app on the
phones or when users access Gmail.
The daily connections to Teams, and its data traﬃc volume, increased ten-
fold right after the lockdown. This surge reﬂects the shift of administrative meet-
ings (for faculty and staﬀ still present on campus) to the remote format. On the
other hand, daily Zoom connections and traﬃc declined after March 2020 since
few students remained on-campus. It was not until the Summer 2020 semester
that Zoom usage grew, since more classes were oﬀered then.
In mid-July 2020, we made a conﬁguration change in the monitor (as
described earlier), which enabled better tracking of long-duration connections.
Consequently, there are increases observed in connections and data volumes for
both Zoom and Teams since then. With this change, we have a more complete
view to compare with the baseline before the lockdown. For example, compar-
ing the measurements in July, August, and September with February (baseline)
shows that the total number of connections to Zoom in July is about 9.5x that in
February, and this ratio for August and September is 11x and 20x, respectively.
The corresponding ratios for the aggregated byte traﬃc volume are 27x, 36x,
and 48x. These numbers illustrate the pronounced eﬀects of Zoom following the
lockdown.
The growth in traﬃc for Teams is even more dramatic. The total number
of connections in July, August, and September are (respectively) 9x, 11x, and

14x that for February, while total byte traﬃc volumes are 424x, 447x, and 448x
that in February. This increase in Teams traﬃc after the lockdown shows the
prevalence of the application among staﬀ and faculty who are still on campus
after the lockdown. In February, Zoom traﬃc volume was 27x larger than the
Teams traﬃc. However, this dominance decreases to 1.6x, 2x, and 2.6x in July,
August, and September, respectively. These trends may reﬂect diﬀerent bit rate,
video resolution, or compression settings in the two applications [21]. Even with
fewer people on campus, there has been a signiﬁcant increase in Zoom and Teams
traﬃc on our campus network.
Figure 7 shows a strong weekly usage pattern for Zoom and Teams, both
in the connection counts and the data traﬃc volume. Every hump represents
ﬁve consecutive working days of network activity, while the valleys show the
weekends where those activities are reduced. However, this weekly pattern is
less prominent in the Google Meet traﬃc, especially for connection counts, which
implies the system-generated nature of many of these connections.
Figure 8 takes a closer look at diurnal usage patterns in Zoom traﬃc at a
ﬁner-grain time scale. Figure 8(a) illustrates the hourly counts for Zoom connec-
tions in three separate weeks from February, July, and September. Figure 8(b)
shows the hourly byte traﬃc volume (in GB) for the same weeks, with inbound
and outbound traﬃc combined. In both plots, there is a clear diurnal pattern,
with increases in connections and byte traﬃc volume during normal working
hours, and a decline overnight. Recall that the week in February was pre-
pandemic, and the Zoom traﬃc was negligible. Nonetheless, the connections
were established during working hours. The week in July represents the lock-
down period. Although many restrictions were lifted by that time, it was after
the monitor’s conﬁguration change, and the data is more complete. The week
in September is after Fall 2020 classes began, and we see increased traﬃc, as
expected.
Figure 8 shows two notable peaks per weekday in the selected weeks from
July and September. The ﬁrst one is in the morning and the second is in the
afternoon, both during working hours. On some days, there is a third peak in

the late evening, especially in the traﬃc volume graph. All these peaks in the
network traﬃc represent diurnal patterns from human-driven behavior.
Figure 9(a) illustrates the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the
connection durations for each of the three meeting applications under study
during ﬁve working days of September 2020. For Zoom, 80% of the connections
are less than 50 min. For Teams, 90% of the connections last less than one hour.
For Google Meet, the vast majority of connections have very short durations,
often less than a minute, once again suggesting the machine-generated6 nature
of them rather than human-generated. However, the tail of the distribution for
all three applications extends well to the right, with some connections lasting
up to 5.5 h, as can be seen in Fig. 9(b). The main takeaway from Fig. 9 is that
Zoom connections tend to have longer durations than Teams and Meet, reﬂecting
usage of Zoom for classes and workshops with prolonged durations.
We next analyze connection durations for Zoom traﬃc in particular. At UCal-
gary, most courses are oﬀered on either the Monday/Wednesday/Friday (MWF)
schedule with 50-min lectures, or the Tuesday/Thursday (TuTh) schedule with
75-min lectures. Since most classes were delivered via Zoom after the lockdown,
we expect to see some evidence of that in the distribution of Zoom connection
durations.
Figure 10 shows the empirical distribution of Zoom connection durations for
ﬁve consecutive working days from Fall 2020. Figure 10(a) for MWF conﬁrms
the expected peak around 50 min. Figure 10(b) for TuTh shows a small peak
near 75 min duration, with a wide range of other values observed. Note that for
courses with labs or tutorials, the timings may be diﬀerent. For example, tutorial
slots are usually 50 min, regardless of which day of the week they occur. These
observations are congruent with our expectations, and conﬁrm the widespread
usage of Zoom for class delivery at UCalgary.

Utilities for NAT) protocol traﬃc on UDP port 19302.

5.2 Detailed Traﬃc Analysis
Via active measurement experiments, we have gained further insights [8] into the
structure of Zoom sessions. Note that there are several diﬀerent ways to set up
Zoom, depending on the client application, server deployment, or cloud solution
in use. Our university uses the default approach with remote Zoom servers, and
no Zoom Meeting Zones located inside the campus.
The connection process to initiate or join a meeting depends on the client’s
application (e.g., desktop app, mobile app, or Web browser). When using Zoom
