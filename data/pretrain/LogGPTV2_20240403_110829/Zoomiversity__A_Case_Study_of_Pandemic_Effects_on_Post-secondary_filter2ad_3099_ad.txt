### Authentication Server Traffic Analysis

**Overview:**
The authentication server traffic is analyzed in one-hour intervals throughout the week, revealing distinct patterns before and during the pandemic.

**Pre-Pandemic (September 2019):**
- **Daily Pattern:** Two daily peaks in authentication traffic were observed on weekdays.
  - **Morning Peak:** Reflects users logging in from home to check emails and access course web pages before arriving on campus.
  - **Evening Peak:** Indicates users accessing these resources after returning home from campus.
- **Weekend Traffic:** Significantly lower than weekday traffic, with peaks shifted slightly later in the morning.

**During Pandemic (September 2020):**
- **Single Daily Peak:** A single peak in the morning, with sessions often lasting several hours or all day due to the lack of need to log out and commute.
- **Increased Traffic:** Substantial increase in authentication traffic as new students joined the campus community and more people worked and learned from home.
- **Weekend Traffic:** Lower than weekday traffic, as expected, with peaks shifted slightly later in the morning.

**Insight:**
- **Usage Patterns Shift:** Working from home led to prolonged sessions and a shift in usage patterns.

### Changes in Connection Counts (Figure 3)

**Comparison:**
- **Data Source:** September 2019 vs. September 2020.
- **Visualization:** Bubbles represent countries, with size proportional to the change in connection counts.
  - **Increase in Connections:** Most prominent in Canada, followed by the Netherlands, UK, and the US.
  - **Decrease in Connections:** Largest decrease in Hong Kong, followed by Japan, Ukraine, and Indonesia.

### Learning Management System (LMS) Traffic

**Overview:**
- **Platform:** UCalgary uses D2L (Desire2Learn) hosted in Quebec, Canada.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Users are redirected to campus authentication servers at the start and end of LMS sessions, allowing for traffic counting.

**Pre-Pandemic (September 2019):**
- **Daily Pattern:** Evening peak when most people returned home, with less visible traffic during the day due to on-campus activity.

**During Pandemic (September 2020):**
- **Daily Pattern:** Higher and more consistent activity throughout the day, with significant changes in the pattern.
- **Diurnal Patterns:** Still evident, with a decline on weekends.

### Remote Access Protocols (SSH, VPN, RDP)

**Overview:**
- **Protocols Analyzed:** SSH, VPN, and RDP.
- **Data Visualization:** Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show daily connection counts and byte traffic volume, respectively, for the entire year 2020.

**SSH:**
- **Connection Count:** Dominated by scripts and automated processes.
- **Traffic Volume:** Increased 2â€“5x compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, partly due to the July configuration change that improved visibility into long-duration connections.

**VPN:**
- **Connection Count and Data Volume:** Increased by a factor of about 10x after the lockdown.
- **Usage Patterns:** Longer durations and higher data transfer compared to SSH.
- **Geographical Distribution:** Increased connection count from a larger set of external IPs worldwide.

**RDP:**
- **Activity Level:** Lowest for both connections and data volumes, limited to Windows users and requiring a registered system on campus.

### Zoom Network Traffic Analysis

**Overview:**
- **Motivation:** Growth and volume of Zoom traffic during the pandemic.
- **Comparison Apps:** Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.

**Pre-Pandemic (February 2020):**
- **Popular App:** Google Meet, with almost 100K connections per day.
- **Zoom Usage:** Only 1K connections per day.

**During Pandemic (March 2020 Onwards):**
- **Zoom and Teams:** Significant growth, with Zoom reaching comparable connection activity to Meet by September 2020.
- **Google Meet:** Decreased in connections but maintained similar data traffic volume, suggesting prolonged usage and system-generated probes.

**Weekly and Diurnal Patterns:**
- **Weekly Pattern:** Strong weekly usage pattern for Zoom and Teams, with reduced activity on weekends.
- **Diurnal Pattern:** Clear diurnal pattern with peaks during working hours and a decline overnight.

**Connection Durations:**
- **Zoom:** 80% of connections last less than 50 minutes, reflecting class and workshop durations.
- **Teams:** 90% of connections last less than one hour.
- **Google Meet:** Majority of connections have very short durations, often less than a minute.

**Detailed Traffic Analysis:**
- **Active Measurement Experiments:** Further insights into the structure of Zoom sessions, including different client applications and server deployments.

This structured and detailed analysis provides a comprehensive view of the changes in network traffic patterns and remote access usage during the pandemic.
