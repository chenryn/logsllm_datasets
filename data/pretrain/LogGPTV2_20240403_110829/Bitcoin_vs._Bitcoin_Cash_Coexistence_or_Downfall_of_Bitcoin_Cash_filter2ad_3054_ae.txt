at the start and end of these periods, respectively. As a result,
in Figure 7a, we can ﬁnd out the value of rF + rB for the gray
colored periods and the value of rB for non-colored periods.
Here, we can see that the mining power of BCH has ﬂuctuated
considerably when the ratio of the BCH mining difﬁculty to
the BTC mining difﬁculty ( DB
) changes to a value less than
DA
k. Moreover, when the coin mining difﬁculties do not change
while BCH mining is more proﬁtable than BTC mining, large
peaks (i.e., a sudden increase) do not appear. This fact is
conﬁrmed, referring to the purple line in non-colored zones
(e.g., part (3) in Figure 7c). As a result, we can consider that
those ﬂuctuations occur due to ﬁckle miners between BTC and
BCH.
If a miner switches the coin to mine without changes in the
coin mining difﬁculty, this implies that the miner’s strategy

changes (e.g., from A to B). From the method described above,
we can determine the mining power rF used for ﬁckle mining
and the mining power rB used for BCH-only mining. The
points and directions are marked roughly in Figure 8. The red
arrow represents movement in agreement with our analysis,
whereas the black arrow represents movement deviating from
our analysis.
Next, we explain Figure 8 by matching it with each part of
Figure 7.
The beginning of the game. In Figure 7-(1), the status point
is initially in Zone1, and then it moves to Zone2 as shown
in Figure 8a, as the BCH mining power decreases.
Towards the lack of BCH loyal miners.
In Figure 7a-(2),
two peaks occur when the BCH mining difﬁculty decreases
to values less than k, and these peaks appear in the gray
colored periods. Therefore, we can know that these peaks
occur due to ﬁckle miners. The ﬁrst peak indicates that more
and more miners started ﬁckle mining (i.e., increase in rF ).
This is because the upﬂow of the ﬁrst peak is less steep than
that for other peaks, and the downﬂow of the ﬁrst peak is
steeper than the upﬂow of the ﬁrst peak, indicating that rF
increases from near 0 up to near 0.4. Furthermore, one can see
that rB increased at the beginning of Figure 7a-(2). Remark
that Figure 7a shows the value of rB in a non-colored zone.
In addition, the BCH mining power in the valley between
two peaks of Figure 7a-(2) is greater than the mining power
at the end of Figure 7a-(1). This fact shows again that rB
increased at the beginning of Figure 7a-(2). After that, because
the end of Figure 7a-(2) is less than the valley between the
two peaks of Figure 7a-(2), we can know that rB decreased
while rF increased in Figure 7a-(2). Figure 8b represents these
movements described above.
In the beginning of Figure 7a-(3), rB slightly increases,
and it does not correspond with our model; we regard this
as a momentary phenomenon because of a decrease in the
BCH mining difﬁculty. Figure 7b shows that the BCH mining
difﬁculty decreased at the beginning of the part (3). However,
even though the BCH mining difﬁculty decreased, peaks due to
ﬁckle mining do not appear because the relative BCH mining
difﬁculty did not decrease to a value less than k as shown in
Figure 7d. As a result, as can be seen in Figure 8c, the point
moves alternatively between Zone1 and Zone3. One can see
that rF decreased compared with the mining power in the
peaks of Figure 7a-(4) and the peaks in Figure 7a-(2); this
might be because the moving direction in Zone1 is (−,−).
Next, the peaks in the period P presented in Figure 7a-
(4) appeared due to ﬁckle miners because the BTC mining
difﬁculty increased. We can check that DB
in the period P
DA
decreased to a value less than k through Figure 7d. Note that
the fact that the BTC mining difﬁculty increased makes the
value of DB
decrease. Indeed, the two peaks of the period
DA
P show that rF decreases and then increases because rF +
rB is represented in the period P of Figure 7a. This may be
explained according to our model as follows: the state was near
to the boundary between Zone1 and Zone3 at the beginning of
changes to a value close to k.
Figure 7-(4), and then the state entered Zone3 while moving
in the direction (−,−) (the moving direction in Zone1) as in
Figure 8d. Then, the state in Zone3 moved in the direction
(+,−) in agreement with our game, and one can see that the
third peak (i.e., the beginning of the second gray colored zone
in Figure 7a-(4)) is higher than the second peak. After that,
rF decreases (see the second gray colored zone in Figure 7a-
(4)), showing a deviation from our model, which is indicated
by the black arrow in Figure 8d. Indeed, considering this case
as well as Figure 7-(3), we observe such noises in the case
where DB
DA
Next, as shown in Figure 8e, the point in Zone3 moves
in the direction (+,−) again because peaks in Figure 7a-(5)
are higher than that for Figure 7a-(4). Moreover, in Figure 7c-
(4)∼(6), k is roughly decreasing and even drops to about 0.055
in a few cases. In the meantime, the point passes boundary1,3.
Because the state entered Zone1, rF starts to decrease,
moving in the direction (−,−) (as shown in Figure 8f).
Therefore, the ﬁrst peak in Figure 7a-(6) is smaller than the
last peak in Figure 7a-(5). Then, because the second peak is
higher than the ﬁrst peak in Figure 7a-(6), one can see that the
point moved in the direction (+,−) in Zone3 in agreement
with our model, which is, in turn, depicted in Figure 8f.
As can be seen in Figure 8g, rB ﬁrst increases in Figure 7a-
(7), and the point enters Zone1; this is a deviation from our
analysis, which may be explained because the BCH mining
is momentarily more proﬁtable than the BTC mining at the
time. Here, we can see again the noise in the case where the
value of DB
is close to k. However, rB decreases again in
DA
agreement with our model. In addition, one can see that rF
decreases in the meantime because the starting height of the
peak in Figure 7a-(8), which is marked by a red point, is less
than that of the ﬁnal peak in Figure 7a-(6). Therefore, the point
in Zone1 moved in the direction (−,−) and entered Zone3,
conforming with our analysis.
Then, in the second week of Nov. 2017, the price of BCH
was suddenly pumped (k ≈ 0.4 in some cases). Therefore,
Zone2 widens in Figure 8h. Also, the point in Zone3 contin-
uously moves in the direction (+,−), and rF even increases to
over 0.5. It can be seen that the peak in Figure 7-(8) has a right-
angle trapezoid with a positive slope, which indicates that rF
continuously increases even though it was already high. From
the history, we observe that the Bitcoin system often reaches
the lack of BCH loyal miners. However, a breakthrough exists
even in this bad situation. If k continuously increases, Zone2
widens, and it makes the state enter Zone2 and reach close
to the coexistence equilibrium. As a result, considering the
state of Bitcoin as of Nov. 13, 2017, k had to increase to a
minimum of 0.5 in order for the mining power engaging in
ﬁckle mining to decrease.
Close to coexistence. However, at the end of Figure 7-(8),
another hard fork occurred in BCH for updating the difﬁculty
adjustment algorithm, and this inﬂuenced the status as an
external factor. Consequently, the point jumped into Zone2
due to this hard fork as shown in Figure 8h. After the hard
fork, the point moves in the direction (−, +), reaching close to

coexistence. This is shown by this fact that ﬂuctuations became
stable more and more in the beginning of Figure 7a-(9). Note
that peaks occur in a short time after the hard fork because
the BCH mining difﬁculty is quickly adjusted. Even though
the state has been close to coexistence, ﬁckle mining is still
possible and observed as described in Section II. In addition,
as the price continuously changes, the point sometimes enters
Zone3 where ﬁckle mining increases, alternating up and down
in the red semicircle in Figure 8i. In other words, ﬁckle
mining will not completely cease. Therefore, if the Bitcoin
state largely deviates from the equilibrium of coexistence due
to external factors such as a sudden change in prices, then it
is still possible to reach the lack of BCH loyal miners.
Inﬂuence of the lack of BCH loyal miners. We observe that
the Bitcoin system suffered from the lack of BCH loyal miners
before Nov. 13, 2017. Consequently,
the BCH transaction
process speed periodically became low, and it even took about
four hours to generate one block in some cases. Moreover,
we can see that BCH was signiﬁcantly centralized during
the period in which the BCH mining difﬁculty is high. For
example, when considering blocks generated from Oct. 2 to
Oct. 4, only two accounts generated about 70 % of blocks and
there were only ﬁve miners who conducted BCH mining. We
note that, in blockchain systems using a PoW mechanism,
high mining power is an essential factor for high security
blockchain systems. In practice, BCH before Nov. 13, 2017
was susceptible to double spending attacks with only 1∼2%
of the total computational power in the Bitcoin system. There
is also selﬁsh mining [15], which makes the attacker unfairly
earn the extra reward while others suffer a loss. Because of a
decrease in rB, these attacks can be executed with relatively
small mining power. As a result, ﬁckle mining, which heavily
occurred before Nov. 13, 2017, weakened the performance,
decentralization level, and security of the BCH system.
Inﬂuence of the hard fork of BCH. Next, we discuss why
Bitcoin moved toward different equilibria before and after
Nov. 13, 2017. First, in the Bitcoin system before Nov. 13,
2017, rF considerably increased as can be seen in Figure 7a-
(2). Meanwhile, after Nov. 13, 2017, rF did not considerably
increase even though the point passed Zone3. This can be
attributed to the different difﬁculty adjustment algorithms
before and after Nov. 13, 2017; the mining difﬁculty of BCH
is currently adjusted faster than that before Nov. 13, 2017.
Therefore, currently, to conduct ﬁckle mining, miners must
switch between BTC and BCH relatively fast; this would make
the current ﬁckle mining in the Bitcoin system annoying. Then,
can we regard the current state of BCH to be safe if the system
avoids external factors such as a sudden change in prices? We
delay the answer until Section VIII.
B. The ”hash war” between Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV
According to our model, we also describe the “hash war”
that recently occurred between Bitcoin ABC (ABC) and
Bitcoin SV (BSV), which are derived from the original BCH
on Nov. 15, 2018. In this paper, we call ‘Bitcoin ABC’ ABC
rather than BCH to avoid confusion with the original BCH
even though Bitcoin ABC is currently regarded as BCH [35].
This war was caused by the conﬂict over a BCH update
that adds a new opcode, where the BCH factions split into
a reformist group and an opposing group. As a result, this
conﬂict caused the two factions to make their own chain,
where the reformist group is the ABC faction led by Roger
Ver (the owner of Bitcoin.com [36]) and Jihan Wu (the
cofounder of Bitmain and also the owner of BTC.com [9] and
Antpool [37]) and the opposing group is the BSV faction led
by Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre (the CEO of Coingeek [38]).
This split of the original BCH was achieved by a hard fork on
Nov. 15, 2018, and each faction wanted its own chain to be
the longest chain in order to unify the divided BCH. This fact
makes both factions desperately conduct mining of their coins
with vast computational power; thus the hash war occurred
from Nov. 15, 2018 to Nov. 24, 2018. Such behavior of ABC
and BSV factions would inﬂuence on a general miner who
choose its coin among BTC, ABC, and BSV, and we analyze
this situation by dividing into two games: 1) a game between
BTC and ABC and 2) another game between BTC and BSV.
In both games, cstick became signiﬁcantly high during the
hash war period, and we can consider this situation as Case 4
(cstick > k
k+1).
