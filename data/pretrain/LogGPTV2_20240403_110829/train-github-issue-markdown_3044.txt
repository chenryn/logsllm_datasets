## Video Conference: allow setting hotkeys for "on" and "off" (rather than
toggle) for mic mute and camera mute
My young kids are using Teams at school. They have to stay muted until asked
to speak by the teacher. They are easily confused/distracted by having to look
for mute/unmute in the Teams UX, esp. when a teacher asks them a difficult
question.
I use an external device that emulates keyboards to provide a physical button
to mute/unmute. This helps but leaves the challenge of kids not knowing if
they are in a muted or unmuted state. A more intuitive option would be to have
separate "mute" and "unmute" buttons.
**PowerToys can enable this by allowing to define distinct "mute" and "unmute"
hotkey combinations for mic and camera.**
