### Title: Black Hat US-20: EtherOops - Exploring Practical Methods to Exploit Ethernet Packet-in-Packet Attacks

#### Abstract:
The concept of a packet being re-evaluated in transit, leading to a packet-in-packet (PiP) attack, has been demonstrated in various protocols. However, applying this logic to the Ethernet protocol was previously considered only a theoretical possibility. In this talk, we will explore practical and powerful methods to exploit Ethernet PiP attacks. We will demonstrate how an attacker can bypass firewall and NAT solutions, even when targeting networks directly from the Internet. By combining this attack with specific use-cases discovered in IPv6 implementations on Windows and Linux, we will show how an attacker can establish a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) position on an organization's Internet traffic, enabling eavesdropping on corporate communications or launching additional attacks.

#### Key Points:

1. **Practicality and Power of Ethernet PiP Attacks:**
   - We will demonstrate that the conditions under which an Ethernet PiP attack can occur are more common than previously thought.
   - We will detail the physical parameters of Ethernet cables where the likelihood of bit-flips is high, allowing for the attack to be executed within minutes.

2. **Inducing Interference:**
   - We will explore various methods to induce interference in a wide range of Ethernet cable types using specific radio attacks, leading to a remote Ethernet PiP attack that can be executed in minutes.

3. **Triggering the Attack:**
   - We will present techniques for triggering the attack from the Internet, including both 1-click attacks (requiring a user inside the network to click on a specific link) and 0-click attacks (that work without any user interaction).

4. **Exploitation and Consequences:**
   - Once the PiP attack is successful, the attacker can take over devices using known vulnerabilities or establish a MiTM position on the organization's Internet traffic.
   - This enables the attacker to eavesdrop on corporate communications or carry out additional attacks.

#### Conclusion:
Our talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the practical methods to exploit Ethernet PiP attacks, highlighting the broader set of circumstances in which these attacks can occur. We will also discuss the potential impact and mitigation strategies to protect against such threats.
