User: How to write a web crawler program in Python language to obtain data from websites or APIs?
Assistant: To write a web crawler program, the following steps can be followed: 1. Determine the data source to be obtained. It could be a website or an API. 2. Determine the data information to be obtained. For example, information such as article title, author, date, etc. in the website, or specific fields in the API. 3. Plan how to acquire the data. You can use the Requests library in Python to send HTTP requests to websites to get page content. For an API, it is common to use HTTP requests to send specific parameters to get data. 4. Extract data, use BeautifulSoup library, regular expressions or other tools to extract useful information from the acquired data. 5. Store the data. Store the extracted data to a local file, database or other suitable place. Data manipulation and analysis can be done using the Pandas library in Python. 6. Run the program regularly to ensure the latest data. You can use the scheduled task module Cron or APScheduler in Python. Sample code: Get website data: ```python import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = 'https://www.baidu.com' response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser ') # Extract the title of the webpage title = soup.title.string print(title) ``` Get API data: ```python import requests url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather' params = {'q': 'tokyo', 'appid': 'your_app_id'} response = requests.get(url, params=params) data = response.json() # Extract weather information weather_description = data['weather'][ 0]['description'] print(weather_description) ``` Store data: ```python import pandas as pd # Assume that some data list has been extracted from the website or API data = [{'name': 'Tom', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Lucy', 'age': 30}] # Store the data in a local CSV file df = pd.DataFrame(data) df.to_csv('data.csv', index =False) ``` The above examples can be modified and extended according to actual needs. It should be noted that the behavior of web crawlers may violate the use agreement of the website, and should be used with caution and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
