**Description:**
The `fsutil usn` command is used to manage the Update Sequence Number (USN) change journal, which provides a persistent log of all changes made to files on a volume. As files, directories, and other NTFS objects are added, deleted, or modified, NTFS records these changes in the USN change journal. Each record indicates the type of change and the object that was changed. New records are appended to the end of the journal.

**Syntax:**
```shell
fsutil usn [createjournal] m= a= 
fsutil usn [deletejournal] {/d | /n} 
fsutil usn [enablerangetracking] [options]
fsutil usn [enumdata]    
fsutil usn [queryjournal] 
fsutil usn [readdata] 
fsutil usn [readjournal] [c= s=]
```

**Parameters:**

- **createjournal**
  - Creates a USN change journal.
  - `m=`: Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, that NTFS allocates for the change journal.
  - `a=`: Specifies the size, in bytes, of memory allocation that is added to the end and removed from the beginning of the change journal.
  - `<drive>`: Specifies the drive letter (followed by a colon).

- **deletejournal**
  - Deletes or disables an active USN change journal.
  - `/d`: Disables an active USN change journal and returns I/O control while the change journal is being disabled.
  - `/n`: Disables an active USN change journal and returns I/O control only after the change journal is disabled.
  - **CAUTION**: Deleting the change journal impacts the File Replication Service (FRS) and the Indexing Service, as it requires these services to perform a complete (and time-consuming) scan of the volume. This negatively affects FRS SYSVOL replication and DFS link alternates while the volume is being rescanned.

- **enablerangetracking**
  - Enables USN write range tracking for a volume.
  - `c=`: Specifies the chunk size to track on a volume.
  - `s=`: Specifies the file size threshold for range tracking.

- **enumdata**
  - Enumerates and lists the change journal entries between two specified boundaries.
  - `<start_usn>`: Specifies the lower boundary of the range of USN values used to filter the records.
  - `<end_usn>`: Specifies the upper boundary of the range of USN values used to filter the records.
  - `<file_reference_number>`: Specifies the ordinal position within the files on the volume at which the enumeration is to begin.

- **queryjournal**
  - Queries a volume's USN data to gather information about the current change journal, its records, and its capacity.

- **readdata**
  - Reads the USN data for a file.
  - `<file_path>`: Specifies the full path to the file, including the file name and extension. For example: `C:\documents\filename.txt`.

- **readjournal**
  - Reads the USN records in the USN journal.
  - `minver=`: Minimum Major Version of USN_RECORD to return. Default = 2.
  - `maxver=`: Maximum Major Version of USN_RECORD to return. Default = 4.
  - `startusn=`: USN to start reading the USN journal from. Default = 0.

**Remarks:**
- Programs can consult the USN change journal to determine all the modifications made to a set of files. The USN change journal is more efficient than checking timestamps or registering for file notifications.
- The USN change journal is enabled and used by the Indexing Service, File Replication Service (FRS), Remote Installation Services (RIS), and Remote Storage.
- If a change journal already exists on a volume, the `createjournal` parameter updates the change journal's `maxsize` and `allocationdelta` parameters, allowing you to expand the number of records without disabling the journal.
- The change journal can grow larger than the target value but will be truncated at the next NTFS checkpoint to less than this value. NTFS examines the change journal and trims it when its size exceeds the value of `maxsize` plus the value of `allocationdelta`.
- Deleting or disabling an active change journal is very time-consuming, as the system must access all the records in the master file table (MFT) and set the last USN attribute to 0. This process can take several minutes and may continue after a system restart if necessary. During this process, the change journal is not considered active, nor is it disabled. While the system is disabling the journal, it cannot be accessed, and all journal operations return errors. Use extreme care when disabling an active journal, as it adversely affects other applications using the journal.

**Examples:**

- To create a USN change journal on drive C:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn createjournal m=1000 a=100 c:
  ```

- To delete an active USN change journal on drive C:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn deletejournal /d c:
  ```

- To enable range tracking with a specified chunk-size and file-size-threshold:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn enablerangetracking c=16384 s=67108864 C:
  ```

- To enumerate and list the change journal entries between two specified boundaries on drive C:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn enumdata 1 0 1 c:
  ```

- To query USN data for a volume on drive C:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn queryjournal c:
  ```

- To read the USN data for a file in the \Temp folder on drive C:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn readdata c:\temp\sample.txt
  ```

- To read the USN journal with a specific start USN:
  ```shell
  fsutil usn readjournal startusn=0xF00
  ```
