# top-nested operator
The `top-nested` operator performs hierarchical aggregation and value selection.
Imagine you have a table with sales information like regions, salespeople, and amounts sold. The `top-nested` operator can help you answer complex questions, such as "What are the top five regions by sales, and who are the top three salespeople in each of those regions?"
The source data is partitioned based on the criteria set in the first `top-nested` clause, such as region. Next, the operator picks the top records in each partition using an aggregation, such as adding sales amounts. Each subsequent `top-nested` clause refines the partitions created by the previous clause, creating a hierarchy of more precise groups.
The result is a table with two columns per clause. One column holds the partitioning values, such as region, while the other column holds the outcomes of the aggregation calculation, like the sum of sales.
## Syntax
*T* `|` `top-nested` [ *N* ] `of` *Expr* [`with` `others` `=` *ConstExpr*] `by` *Aggregation* [`asc` | `desc`] [`,`  
&emsp;&emsp;`top-nested` ... ]
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Parameters
|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|--|--|--|--|
|*T*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|The input tabular expression.|
|*N*| `int` ||The number of top values to be returned for this hierarchy level. If omitted, all distinct values are returned.|
|*Expr*| `string` | :heavy_check_mark:|An expression over the input record indicating which value to return for this hierarchy level. Typically, it refers to a column from *T* or involves a calculation like [bin()](bin-function.md) on a column. Optionally, set an output column name as *Name* `=` *Expr*.|
|*ConstExpr*| `string` ||If specified, for each hierarchy level, one record is added with the value that is the aggregation over all records that didn't make it to the top.|
|*Aggregation*| `string` ||The aggregation function applied to records with the same *Expr* value. The result determines the top records. See [Supported aggregation functions](#supported-aggregation-functions). Optionally, set an output column name as *Name* `=` *Aggregation*.|
### Supported aggregation functions
The following aggregation functions are supported:
* [sum()](sum-aggregation-function.md)
* [count()](count-aggregation-function.md)
* [max()](max-aggregation-function.md)
* [min()](min-aggregation-function.md)
* [dcount()](dcountif-aggregation-function.md)
* [avg()](avg-aggfunction.md)
* [percentile()](percentiles-aggregation-function.md)
* [percentilew()](percentilesw-aggregation-function.md)
> [!NOTE]
> Any algebraic combination of the aggregations is also supported.
## Returns
A table with two columns for each clause. One column contains unique values computed using *Expr*, and the other column shows the results obtained from the *Aggregation* calculation.
### Include data from other columns
Only columns specified as a `top-nested` clause *Expr* are displayed in the output table.
To include all values of a column at a specific level:
1. Don't specify the value of *N*.
1. Use the column name as the value of *Expr*.
1. Use `Ignore=max(1)` as the value of *Aggregation*.
1. Remove the unnecessary `Ignore` column with [project-away](project-away-operator.md).
For an example, see [Get the most recent events per state with additional data from other columns](#get-the-most-recent-events-per-state-with-additional-data-from-other-columns).
## Performance considerations
The number of records may grow exponentially with the number of `top-nested` clauses, and record growth is even faster if no *N* limit is specified. This operator may consume a considerable amount of resources.
If the distribution of the aggregation is considerably non-uniform, limit the number of distinct values to return by specifying *N*. Then, use the `with` `others` `=` *ConstExpr* specification to get an indication for the weight of all other cases.
## Examples
### Get started with the `top-nested` operator
The following query partitions the `StormEvents` table by the `State` column and calculates the total latitude for each state. The query selects the top two states with the highest latitude sum. Within these top two states, the query groups the data by `Source` and selects the top three sources with the highest latitude sum. For each of the top three sources in the top two states, the query groups the data by `EndLocation` and selects the `EndLocation` with the highest latitude sum.

```kusto
StormEvents                                        // Data source.
| top-nested 2 of State       by sum(BeginLat),    // Top 2 States by total latitude.
  top-nested 3 of Source      by sum(BeginLat),    // Top 3 Sources by total latitude in each State.
  top-nested 1 of EndLocation by sum(BeginLat)     // Top 1 EndLocation by total latitude in each Source and State.
```
**Output**
|State|aggregated_State|Source|aggregated_Source|EndLocation|aggregated_EndLocation|

### Enhance top-nested results with data from another column
The following query builds upon the previous example by introducing an extra `top-nested` clause. In this new clause, the absence of a numeric specification results in the extraction of all distinct values of `EventType` across the partitions. The `max(1)` aggregation function is merely a placeholder, rendering its outcome irrelevant, so the [project-away](project-away-operator.md) operator removes the `Ignore` column. The result shows all event types associated with the previously aggregated data.

  top-nested   of EventType   by Ignore = max(1)

### Use `with` `others` to explore excluded data
When incorporated within a `top-nested` clause, the `with` `others` specification introduces an extra record that aggregates data excluded from the top results. In the following query, an extra record is created in the `State` and `aggregated_State` columns, representing the collective latitude of all states except Kansas and Texas. Moreover, the `EndLocation` and `aggregated_EndLocation` column have an extra nine records. These records show the combined latitude of end locations not qualifying as the top location within each state and source.
