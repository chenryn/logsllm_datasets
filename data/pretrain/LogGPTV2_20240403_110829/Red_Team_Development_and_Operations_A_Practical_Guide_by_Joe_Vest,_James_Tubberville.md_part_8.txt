### Visitor and Data Handling Policies

- All visitors to the Red Team space must be escorted.
- Target data should only be accessed by Red Team personnel with a need-to-know basis.
- At the conclusion of the engagement, all target information will be returned to the customer or destroyed according to defined procedures.

### Software Controls

To ensure the confidentiality, anonymity, and safety of information, the following software controls should be implemented:

1. **Encryption**:
   - Encrypt each host and guest operating system.
   - Use an effective password policy and a multifactor-protected password database to store unique passwords for each engagement.
   - Protect each host and guest operating system with a strong password.
   - Employ a host-based firewall specific to the engagement.

2. **Communication Security**:
   - Encrypt communications whenever possible.
   - Avoid using unsecured file systems or communication protocols (e.g., FTP, Telnet, HTTP, VNC, WEP).
   - Use secure mechanisms for communications (e.g., HTTPS, WebDAV, SSH, RDP).

3. **Data Storage and Transfer**:
   - Store data and tools in an encrypted container, moving them to the working directory only when needed.
   - Ensure all systems, storage, data, and tools are encrypted at all times (data in transit and at rest).
   - Use well-known and community-tested high-strength encryption algorithms.
   - Hash all data and tools transferred to or from target systems using MD5, SHA1, or SHA256, and add them to the OPLOG as discussed in the Data Collection section.

4. **Tool and Data Management**:
   - Add all access, movement, and use of data and tools to the OPLOG.
   - Remove tools that are no longer needed for a task from the target environment.
   - Remove all Red Team tools and software from the target environment at the end of the engagement. If cleanup is not possible, notify the TA and ECG and provide the necessary details.

### Two-Person Integrity (TPI)

Two-person integrity (TPI) is a key factor in data collection and execution. TPI should be maintained at all times to verify activities performed during the engagement. A team member should review, understand, and provide a "sanity check" for each action/command performed. This helps protect both the Red Team and the target/customer against the potential release of sensitive information, violation of legal requirements/laws, and violation of the Rules of Engagement (ROE). TPI also prevents simple errors and mistakes in operation.

### Key Chapter Takeaways

Effective Engagement Planning is crucial for managing potential engagement risks, achieving desired goals, and providing the information required to improve organizational and defensive capabilities. Pay special attention to the following planning elements:

- Roles and Responsibilities
- Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- Threat Planning
- Operational Impacts
- Deconfliction
- Data Handling
- Funding

### Homework

1. Create a red team operations charter and methodology guide.
2. Develop a roles and responsibilities document.
3. Create a threat profile template.
4. Develop a standard ROE template.
5. Develop a deconfliction template.
6. Develop a data handling guideline.
7. Continue adding definitions to the red team lexicon.

### Engagement Execution

Engagement execution begins when event information and planning documentation are finalized, and preparatory actions for conducting the engagement start. The execution phase involves the practical application of the "why" and "how" from planning, including infrastructure buildout and engagement activities.

### Data Repository

All data collected during an engagement must be logged, filed according to data type, and stored in an engagement-specific repository. This repository should be located on an encrypted volume within a centralized server, NAS, or file share, accessible only after authentication.

If at an offsite location, designate a laptop and create an authenticated directory for storing engagement data. Ensure this directory is copied to another laptop daily. The file system should be stored in accordance with policy, physical, and software controls.

As operations begin, the Red Team Lead should mount the engagement-specific volume within the repository (an encrypted volume requiring authentication). Each Red Team Operator will then mount the directory locally for engagement use (requires user authentication). At the end of the day, each operator must unmount the directory, and the Red Team Lead should unmount the repository volume.

A proven method for secure collaborative access to a common repository is mounting a remote file system over SSH. This method requires authentication for access and leverages an encrypted transport mechanism.

### File Hierarchy

The following file hierarchy is recommended for efficient data storage and management during an engagement:

- **//repository/engagement_name/0-admin**: Administrative event information (approved IP lists, ROE, briefings, etc.).
- **//repository/engagement_name/1-osint**: Pre-event collected OSINT information.
- **//repository/engagement_name/2-recon**: Reconnaissance information (DNS lookups, NMAP scans, eyewitness information, etc.).
- **//repository/engagement_name/3-targets**: Per-target specific information (local users, file trees, command output, etc.).
  - **//repository/engagement_name/3-targets/ip_hostname/exfil**: Per-target exfiltrated data (password files, user data, diagrams, etc.). Each target must have a separate folder.
- **//repository/engagement_name/4-screenshots**: Screenshots formatted as YYYYMMDD_HHMM_IP_Description.jpg/png.
- **//repository/engagement_name/5-payloads**: ALL payloads (EXEs, scripts, phishing emails) must be stored under the appropriate subdirectory and entered into the OPLOG.
- **//repository/engagement_name/6-logs**: Stores all exported logs in the appropriate directory, including the final OPLOG.

### Data Collection

Data collection drives the value of the engagement. It should be complete, enable the replication of activities and results, and identify items of significant interest to the operators. Final data sets should include pre-event data, execution data, and post-event data.

### Activity Logs

All activities related to the Red Team operation should be logged from the start of the engagement until all activity is completed. Examples of events to be logged include scanning activities, exploit events, and system events.

### Operator Logs

All activities should be logged accurately and concisely. Each log entry must include the following information:

- Start and End Timestamp (UTC Recommended)
- Source and Destination IP/Hostname
- Tool/Application
- Action and Command
- Output and Description
- Result and System Modification
- Comments and Screenshot (File name)
- Operator Name

### Automated Data Collection

Leverage tools and scripts to capture and consolidate engagement data. While automated data collection alone is not sufficient for a well-written final report, it can be useful for capturing raw data to validate activities, reproduce results, and support recommendations.

### Terminal Logs

Automate the collection of raw terminal/console data. Each command should be prefixed with the operator's IP address and UTC timestamp. Save these tagged logs to a location such as /root/logs/terminal/.

### Commercial and Custom Tools

Commercial tools used for penetration testing or Red Teaming should have logging capabilities. Custom tools should also create logs during execution, capturing all required data points in the YYYYMMDD_HHMM_IP_Description format.

### Consolidation

Transfer logs to the engagement repository daily. Use a backup or rollup script to copy each set of logs to the repository at the end of the day.

### Screenshots

Screenshots provide visual proof of Red Team actions. During physical assessments, pictures or video of buildings, offices, desks, server rooms, restricted areas, etc., are generally required for proof of entry. Use stickers with the Red Team logo in areas of interest and place them within the frame when capturing images.

### Tradecraft

Tradecraft, borrowed from the intelligence community, refers to the techniques and procedures of espionage. In Red Teaming, it encompasses the how and why of Red Team actions. Threat portrayal requirements directly impact the choice of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). A Red Team may choose custom, highly advanced tools to support an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) or use simple, "script kiddie" techniques to emulate an ordinary hacker.
