Abstract
Viruses that infect smartphones are emerging as a new
front in the ﬁght against computer viruses. In this paper,
we model the propagation of mobile phone viruses in or-
der to study their impact on the dependability of mobile
phones. We propose response mechanisms and use the mod-
els to obtain insight on the effectiveness of these virus mit-
igation techniques. In particular, we consider the effects of
multimedia messaging system (MMS) viruses that spread by
sending infected messages to other phones. The virus model
is implemented using the M¨obius software tool and is highly
parameterized, enabling representation of a wide range of
potential MMS virus behavior. Using the model, we present
the results of four illustrative MMS virus scenarios simu-
lated with and without response mechanisms. By measur-
ing the propagation rate and the extent of virus penetration
in the simulation phone population, we quantitatively com-
pare the effectiveness of mobile phone virus response mech-
anisms.
1. Introduction
The
enhanced computational
and communication
smartphones are beginning to attract
capabilities of
viruses targeted at these increasingly sophisticated mobile
phones [12]. The problem is expected to worsen as smart-
phones become more prevalent and as virus writers become
more proﬁcient in working with mobile phones [11].
Attacks from mobile phone viruses can compromise
personal information, delete data, drain the battery [9],
and steal phone services by using expensive features [3].
The impact of mobile phone viruses on phone service
providers includes increased customer complaints concern-
ing infected phones and extra network congestion due to
the virus-related trafﬁc [12]. It is imperative that the mobile
phone industry anticipate and act now against these looming
threats to dependable and secure mobile phone services.
Because mobile phones are communications devices
with many connectivity options, there exist many possi-
ble infection vectors [11]. Mobile phones can become in-
fected by downloading infected ﬁles using the phone Inter-
net browser, by transferring ﬁles between phones using the
Bluetooth interface, by synchronizing with an infected com-
puter, by accessing an infected physical memory card, or by
opening infected ﬁles attached to multimedia message ser-
vice (MMS) messages. MMS messages are similar to text
messages between mobile phones, but MMS messages are
capable of including attached ﬁles, much like email with
attached ﬁles.
The most threatening propagation vectors permit rapid
and widespread virus penetration throughout a network of
phones. Based on this criterion, one of the most sig-
niﬁcant threats is propagation by MMS message attach-
ments [11], [12], [7]. Thus, we choose to focus on mobile
phone viruses spreading via MMS messages.
Mobile phone security measures can leverage existing
antivirus efforts against traditional computer viruses, but
the effectiveness of these measures must be evaluated in the
context of the mobile phone network environment. Mobile
phone viruses are expected to follow an evolution similar to
that of computer viruses, only at an accelerated pace [12].
Our model of mobile phone virus propagation leverages
related work in computer virus modeling. Kephart and
White introduced epidemiological models to the study of
computer viruses [6]. More recent work utilizes Markov
models to incorporate the probability distributions of model
behavior [1]. Some other related work on models of email
viruses has inﬂuenced our work on models of mobile phone
viruses. In much the same way that models of email virus
propagation incorporate user behavior [14], our model of
mobile phone viruses considers factors such as how quickly
a phone user reads a new MMS message and how likely a
phone user is to open an infected attachment. In addition,
our development of mobile phone response mechanisms is
related to research on defenses against computer network
worms [8]. Some researchers have proposed mobile phone
defense measures [5], but they perform no quantitative eval-
uation on their proposed measures.
In this paper we present research quantifying the impact
of virus propagation on the dependability of mobile phone
systems. We also quantify the effectiveness of a range of po-
tential virus mitigation techniques. Section 2 describes the
general attack process of a mobile phone virus, and Section
3 describes the six response mechanisms to be evaluated. In
Section 4, we discuss the implementation of the model used
to generate the results presented in Section 5. Four test case
virus scenarios are deﬁned. We analyze the simulation re-
sults by comparing the virus propagation with and without
response mechanisms.
2. Mobile Phone Virus Attack Process
For the mobile phone virus propagation that we model,
the infection starts with a single infected phone. The virus
on this phone sends MMS messages with an infected at-
tachment ﬁle to other phones. These targeted phones are
either selected from the contact list of the infected phone or
selected by dialing a random phone number.
Each infected MMS message is delivered to its target
phone. After the user of the target phone notices this new
MMS message, the user must choose whether to accept the
accompanying attachment. If the unsuspecting user accepts
the infected attachment ﬁle using a phone susceptible to the
virus, then the virus is installed, the target phone becomes
infected, and the target phone begins to function as an at-
tacker phone.
3. Mobile Phone Virus Response Mechanisms
In response to the mobile phone viruses spreading via
MMS messages, we present mechanisms intended to slow
or stop the infection dissemination. In contrast to the situ-
ation with email viruses, where the antivirus vendor is typ-
ically separate from the Internet service provider, mobile
phone service providers have expressed an interest in devel-
oping and deploying antivirus measures. As a consequence,
these response mechanisms can incorporate the network in-
frastructure hardware owned by the mobile phone service
provider, as well as the information already collected by the
phone service provider for billing purposes.
In this section, we propose six response mechanisms for
mobile phone viruses. We categorize the response mecha-
nisms as actions taken at one of three response points during
the virus propagation process: the point of reception by tar-
get phones, the point of infection on target phones, and the
point of dissemination from infected phones.
3.1. Virus Response Mechanisms at the
Point of Reception
The ﬁrst two response mechanisms focus on prevent-
ing infected MMS messages from reaching their intended
targets. These response mechanisms use the infrastructure
owned by the mobile phone service provider.
Virus scan of all MMS attachments in an MMS gateway.
During the normal delivery process for an MMS message,
the mobile phone service provider routes the MMS mes-
sage through its MMS gateway hardware. As each MMS
message passes through a gateway, this virus scan response
mechanism examines the MMS attachment for known virus
signatures. Attachments identiﬁed as infected are prevented
from reaching their intended recipients. Admittedly, when
a new virus appears, there is lag time between the initial ap-
pearance and when the new virus signature can be added to
the list of known viruses. Our experimental results illustrate
how the length of that delay affects the relative effectiveness
of this response mechanism.
Virus detection algorithm in an MMS gateway. While
the virus scan response mechanism identiﬁes speciﬁc
known virus signatures, the virus detection algorithm ap-
proach is more universal and can detect previously uniden-
tiﬁed viruses. The algorithm identiﬁes infected MMS mes-
sages by looking for suspicious traits characteristic of a
virus. When a virus is ﬁrst detected, the virus detection
algorithm in the MMS gateway analyzes the infected mes-
sages to determine the best way to recognize the presence of
this virus in subsequent MMS messages. After the analysis
period is complete, the MMS gateway detection algorithm
successfully recognizes and stops each subsequent virus-
infected MMS with some probability. We study how high
this probability must be in order for the detection algorithm
to be effective.
Both the virus scan and the virus detection algorithm op-
erate within the MMS gateway infrastructure of the phone
service provider. These response mechanisms at the point
of reception stop the infected message in transit before the
message reaches the target phone. The next line of defense
involves stopping the virus at the point of infection.
3.2. Virus Response Mechanisms at the
Point of Infection
The next two response mechanisms focus on the infected
MMS messages that have already passed through the MMS
gateways and have arrived in the inboxes of target phones.
The goal here is to stop the virus from actually infecting
the target phone. This can be accomplished by stopping
the user from accepting the infected MMS attachment or by
immunizing the phone against the virus attack.
Phone user education. Educating phone users about the
risks associated with accepting and installing unsolicited
MMS message attachments can help reduce the probabil-
ity that users will choose to accept infected messages [3].
Since the user acceptance of the virus is a vital link in the
virus propagation, reducing the probability of acceptance
has a direct impact on the ability of a virus to spread. Many
people are still unaware of the existence of mobile phone
viruses, and educating those phone users would encourage
them to be more cautious concerning suspicious MMS mes-
sages. Phone user education can also include warning mes-
sages when the user attempts to perform actions that would
potentially compromise the security of the phone. For ex-
ample, the installation of digitally unsigned executable ﬁles
could trigger a warning message to the user.
Our experimental results illustrate how decreasing the
probability that a phone user will accept a virus to only one-
half or one-fourth of the baseline acceptance rate can limit
the virus spread.
Immunization using software patches. Although the
phone user education response mechanism strives to dis-
suade the user from accepting infected messages, other re-
sponse mechanisms, such as immunization, can prevent in-
fection even if the user accepts the MMS message attach-
ment. The immunization response mechanism operates us-
ing software placed directly on each mobile phone.
After the service provider detects a virus that exploits a
vulnerability, the service provider begins developing a patch
to ﬁx that vulnerability. Once the patch is developed, the
immunization software resident on each mobile phone auto-
matically installs any immunization patches available. Due
to bandwidth constraints, all the phones cannot receive the
patch simultaneously, so the patch is rolled out to the en-
tire phone population uniformly over a period of time. The
more servers that are dedicated to distributing these patches,
the faster the deployment to all susceptible phones in the
network. After the deployed patch arrives at a particular
phone, that phone becomes immunized from the virus if not
already infected, or the patch stops further propagation at-
tempts from the phone if the phone is already infected.
Our experimental results show how both the time to de-
velop the patch and the time to distribute the patch to the
entire population of susceptible phones can inﬂuence the ef-
fectiveness of this response mechanism. Varying the patch
distribution time is equivalent to varying the number of
servers dedicated to deploying the patch.
Immunization and phone user education are both de-
fensive response mechanisms to protect uninfected phones
from becoming infected. However, after a phone has al-
ready been compromised, the response mechanism must act
offensively to stop further dissemination of the virus.
3.3. Virus Response Mechanisms at the
Point of Dissemination
The ﬁnal two response mechanisms focus on containing
the virus spread by preventing infected phones from dis-
seminating more infected messages. Virus spread can be
contained if propagation efforts by infected phones are de-
tected and suppressed.
Monitoring for anomalous behavior. Some anomaly de-
tection algorithms for mobile phones already exist [10], [2].
Before the monitoring response mechanism can detect
anomalous virus behavior, the monitoring mechanism must
ﬁrst be trained to recognize normal user behavior. Our mon-
itoring mechanism is a count of the number of MMS mes-
sages sent from a particular phone during a period of time.
When the monitor detects an excessive number of outgo-
ing MMS messages (above a threshold based on normal ex-
pected usage), the behavior is ﬂagged as suspicious.
When a phone is suspected of being infected, there are
several possible responses, including simply alerting the
phone user, completely blocking subsequent outgoing mes-
sages from the phone, or adding a forced waiting time be-
tween outgoing messages. For the monitoring response
mechanism in our experiments, the forced delay between
outgoing messages is imposed on phones that exceed the
speciﬁed threshold. Our studies compare the effectiveness
of the monitoring response mechanism while varying the
length of the enforced minimum time between outgoing
messages.
Blacklist phones suspected of infection.
In contrast to
the monitoring response mechanism that counts all outgo-
ing MMS messages (infected or not), the blacklisting re-
sponse mechanism counts only messages suspected of be-
ing infected. Then, when the number of suspected infected
messages for a phone reaches some threshold value, the
service provider places that phone on a blacklist and com-
pletely stops MMS service for that phone (until the phone is
proven to be uninfected). Our experiments determine how
low the threshold must be for blacklisting to be effective
against different types of viruses.
In summary, the six proposed response mechanisms are
categorized based on the three response points in the propa-
gation process: the point of reception by target phones, the
point of infection on target phones, and the point of dissem-
ination from infected phones. The effectiveness of these six
response mechanisms is evaluated using a model of virus
propagation in a mobile phone system.
4. Model Implementation
To quantify mobile phone virus spread and evaluate the
effectiveness of the response mechanisms, we perform sim-
ulations using a parameterized stochastic model of a net-
work of mobile phones. Some parameters control virus be-
havior and are varied to produce different virus scenarios.
Other parameters control speciﬁc characteristics of the re-
sponse mechanisms.
The scope of the model includes only mobile phone
