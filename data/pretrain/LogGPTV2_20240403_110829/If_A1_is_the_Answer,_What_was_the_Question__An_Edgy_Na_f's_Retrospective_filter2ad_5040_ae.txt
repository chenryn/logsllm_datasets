### The Anderson Panel and Research Funding

The activities of the Anderson Panel were significantly influenced by the decline in research funding following the Vietnam War and related endeavors. The primary sources of funding for both research and development were the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and its affiliated agencies.

### Private Sector Developments

The private sector also contributed to the field, developing several security-oriented commercial products and prototypes. Notable examples include:

- **IBM's Resource Access Control Facility (RACF)**: An add-on to the MVS and Virtual Machine Facility/370 (VM/370) operating systems.
- **Tymshare’s Gnosis**: A capability-based operating system.

### DoD-Sponsored Systems and Prototypes

The U.S. DoD sponsored the development of several prototypes and operational systems, including:

- **Multilevel AFDSC Multics**
- **MITRE UNIX 11/45 prototype**
- **Stanford Research Institute’s Provably Secure Operating System (PSOS) design**
- **Multilevel secure versions of UNIX** (Ford Aerospace’s KSOS-11 and Honeywell’s KSOS-6)
- **SDC’s Kernelized VM/370 (KVM/370)**
- **Ford Aerospace’s AUTODIN II**
- **ITT/IBM’s SACDIN**
- **SDC’s BLACKER project**

Additionally, two significant projects focused on multilevel database management:

- **Hinke-Schaefer Multilevel DBMS**: Sponsored by the Rome Air Development Center (RADC), this project aimed to develop a multilevel relational database management system that could run under an unmodified AFDSC Multics. It used Petri nets to synchronize database queries and updates.
- **IP Sharp Associates’ Multilevel DBMS Model**: Developed for the Air Force Electronic Systems Division, this model was designed to be implemented within Rings 1 and 2 of Multics and identified various security primitives for multilevel database management.

### Toward System Security Evaluation Criteria

By 1978, researchers and developers began to claim they knew how to implement secure or "secure enough" systems. However, few fully operational and well-tuned secure systems were available. While multilevel AFDSC Multics and ADEPT-50 had been deployed and accredited, their performance was not optimal, and they were far from being user-friendly. AUTODIN, although accredited for full multilevel use, would likely fail a recertification and accreditation analysis based on contemporary technical knowledge of vulnerability analysis.

### Covert Channel Analysis

The research community had made progress in understanding covert channel analysis (CCA). Many claimed that with the new secure systems, unauthorized direct access to files, spooling files, printer queues, and other processes' address spaces would be impossible. Communication between cooperating Trojan horses would only be possible through timed modulation of system artifacts, violating the system's security policy interpretation of confinement or the Bell-LaPadula *-property. Various technologies and formal analysis tools were developed to identify, measure, and use covert channels.

### Security Kernels vs. Trusted Computing Bases (TCBs)

Many in the security research and development community opposed the reference monitor concept and its implementation as a security kernel, citing inefficiencies in central mediation and context switching. The Bell-LaPadula models addressed some of these issues by using descriptors or tokens for rapid access validation. However, the problem of immediate revocation of access rights remained, especially in non-Multics architectures where such features were deemed too costly.

### Global Processes and Information Flow Confinement

Global processes, which allocate or modulate system resources, could be exploited to violate information flow requirements, even when implemented correctly. This issue was evident in systems like KVM/370, KSOS, and SCOMP. The Bell-LaPadula models provided for trusted subjects, but global processes posed additional challenges. Isolating these processes in less privileged domains led to inefficiencies, leading to the conclusion that systems should be called "trusted" rather than "secure." The term "security kernel" was replaced with "Trusted Computing Base (TCB)," a more flexible but vaguely defined concept.

### Distributed Mediation and Capabilities

The movement against centralized security kernels led to the development of systems with distributed mediation. The Provably Secure Operating System (PSOS) project, for example, introduced a methodology for designing, implementing, and proving properties of large computing systems. PSOS used capabilities, unforgeable and immutable tokens, to grant specific access rights. Despite open questions about initial configuration and capability distribution, it was asserted that PSOS could implement a secure multilevel operating system.

### GNOSIS and KeyKOS

Norm Hardy, Charlie Landau, and Bill Frantz at Tymshare, Inc., designed the Great New Operating System In the Sky (GNOSIS), a commercially developed, capability-based time-sharing environment. Similar to PSOS, GNOSIS raised questions about capability distribution and security state determination, which were also relevant to its successor, KeyKOS.

### Lee Panel, NBS 1978

The National Bureau of Standards (NBS) organized an invitational workshop on standards for computer security and audit. One of its panels, chaired by Ted Lee, focused on standardizing the assessment of security controls in processors, operating systems, and nearby peripherals.
