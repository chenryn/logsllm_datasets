User: I installed Anaconda via command line. The bash file.
If Im in bash, I can open and use anaconda, like notebooks, ipython, etc.
If I change my shell to ZSH, all the anaconda commands appear like "not found".
How I can make it work in zsh? 
I use a Mac with OSx Sierra.
Thanks in advance,
Assistant: I had a similar issue after I installed anaconda3 in ubuntu.
This is how I solved it:
1) I changed to bash and anaconda can work
2) I changed to zsh, and anaconda works. I don't know why, but I think you can try.
