Hi guys,  
I'm trying to test the performance of my app by using react perf tools. The
problem is its not working.  
I call
    Perf.start()
    Perf.stop()
    Perf.printWasted()
in the console, which works (no console errors or warnings), but
`printWasted()` always returns empty Array and a message
> Total time: 0.00 ms
This also happens for other functions like `printInclusive()` and
`printExclusive()`  
What can be the problem?  
P.S I'm using react-router, how is react perf performing with that? Maybe
that's causing some issues?  
Also, `process.env.NODE_ENV` is not set to production, and I'm using `React
0.13.3`
