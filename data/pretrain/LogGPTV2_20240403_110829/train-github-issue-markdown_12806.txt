The instructions state: "Let's delete the 'tails' property from myDog." However, the test being run is: "Delete the property 'bark' from myDog." The test should actually verify whether the key-value pair for the 'tails' property has been removed. 

To clarify, the test should be updated to ensure it checks for the deletion of the 'tails' property, not the 'bark' property.
