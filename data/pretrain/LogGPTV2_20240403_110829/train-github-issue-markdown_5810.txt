Greetings,
continuation from this problem #12134  
thanks brendan, after the update, nodes were restarted and all containers
started without problems, but there is one thing I am really afraid of my
`mongodb` instances.
I'm using this yaml file, just cut the container list.
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: mongodb-shard1-controller
    spec:
      replicas: 2
      selector:
        name: mongodb-shard1-controller
        version: v0
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            name: mongodb-shard1-controller
            version: v0
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: mongodb-node1
            image: gcr.io/app/mongodb3.0.4
            ports:
            - containerPort: 27017
              hostPort: 27031
            env:
              - name: REPL_SET
                value: kube_shard1
            volumeMounts:
              - mountPath: /data/db
                name: db-path
          volumes:
            - name: db-path
              source:
                emptyDir: {}
it may not be the best, but I am using it in production. after the nodes
restarted, all replica sets of mongodb instances, could not connect on to each
other, and other than that, databases are gone. and I could not get it back up
w/databases. i don't know where is `/data/db` gone?
I'm using `GCP`, what is the best practice for database storages?
