Question: A security consultant suggests that to mitigate XSS through IMG tags, the application should set all session cookies to be HttpOnly and always use consistent output encoding like UTF-8. Which of the following statements provide valid counterarguments to the consultant's suggestions?
"A": "Setting HttpOnly on session cookies would not prevent XSS where the script does not target the session cookie.",
"B": "Using consistent output encoding like UTF-8 does not mitigate XSS if the encoding is not properly specified to the browser.",
"C": "HttpOnly cookies require the browser to support JavaScript, which may not be available in all user environments.",
"D": "Specifying UTF-8 encoding can increase the risk of SQL Injection attacks if the database does not support this encoding."
Answer: AB
