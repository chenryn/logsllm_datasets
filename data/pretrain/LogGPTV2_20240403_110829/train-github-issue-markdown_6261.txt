I want to request a feature
**What is the current behavior?**
Using `Symbols` as element keys throws a type error.
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and
if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster
if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or
CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**
When using `key={Symbol('myKeySymbol')}` we get the following `TypeError:
Cannot convert a Symbol value to a string at
Object.ReactElement.createElement`

**What is the expected behavior?**  
Using `Symbols` as keys should work seamlessly, in my opinion element keys are
a perfect use-case for `Symbols`.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
Using React `16.0.0` and the browsers affected are Safari, Chrome and Firefox
on OSX, but I'm pretty sure this is not browser dependent but a matter of
implementation.
    Thanks.
