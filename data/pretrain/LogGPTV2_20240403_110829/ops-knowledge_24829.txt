User: I have installed Python 2.7.2 (Win7 32-bit) and Google App Engine SDK 1.6.1 for Win7 on a 64-bit system running Win7 Home Premium.  Default folder locations for both Python and GAE.  When I try to run the helloworld project as described in the Google Python Getting Started doc, the Launcher's "browse" button never becomes active.  The GAE SDK is supposed to do fine with Python 2.7.
Is there a complete listing anywhere of environment variables needed for this setup to work?  So far, all posts I have seen are from users who have gotten well past this absolutely basic step.
Assistant: I did two changes together -
1. added the line at the top of app.yaml file "application:helloworld"
2. changed the last line in app.yaml "script: helloworld.app" to "script: helloworld.py"
my GAE started working. However to islolate the issue I 'undid' both changes, it turns out that the the 2nd change - changing helloworld.app to helloworld.py did the magic
