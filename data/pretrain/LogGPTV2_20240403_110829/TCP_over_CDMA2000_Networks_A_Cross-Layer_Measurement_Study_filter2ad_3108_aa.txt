Abstract. Modern cellular channels in 3G networks incorporate sophisticated
power control and dynamic rate adaptation which can have a signiﬁcant impact
on adaptive transport layer protocols, such as TCP. Though there exists studies
that have evaluated the performance of TCP over such networks, they are based
solely on observations at the transport layer and hence have no visibility into the
impact of lower layer dynamics, which are a key characteristic of these networks.
In this work, we present a detailed characterization of TCP behavior based on
cross-layer measurement of transport, as well as RF and MAC layer parameters.
In particular, through a series of active TCP/UDP experiments and measurement
of the relevant variables at all three layers, we characterize both, the wireless
scheduler in a commercial CDMA2000 network and its impact on TCP dynamics.
Somewhat surprisingly, our ﬁndings indicate that the wireless scheduler is mostly
insensitive to channel quality and sector load over short timescales and is mainly
affected by the transport layer data rate. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate
the impact of the wireless scheduler on various TCP parameters such as the round
trip time, throughput and packet loss rate.
1 Introduction
With advances in error-correction coding, processing power and cellular technology,
the wireless channel need no longer be viewed as an error-prone channel with low
bandwidth. Instead, modern 3G cellular networks (e.g CDMA2000 1xRTT, EV-DO,
HSDPA/UMTS) deploy ARQ mechanisms for fast error recovery, as well as sophisti-
cated wireless schedulers that can perform “on-the-ﬂy” rate adaptation. The latter fea-
ture allows the network to adapt to diverse conditions such as channel quality, sector
load and more importantly, as we show in this work, data backlog.
The dynamic rate adaptation of modern cellular channels implies that a source will
typically experience variable bandwidth and delay, which may be caused by the sched-
uler’s dependency on buffer backlog. Since TCP, the dominant transport protocol in the
Internet, utilizes feedback from the channel to control its transmission rate (indirectly
the buffer backlog), this creates a situation where two controllers, the wireless scheduler
and TCP, share a single control variable.
There are several interesting studies that have considered the performance of TCP
over cellular networks [2,5,9]. However, they mostly rely on measurement of TCP dy-
namics at the transport layer and have no visibility into the underlying MAC nor the

dynamics of the radio channel. In this work, we measure relevant information at all
three layers in a commercial CDMA2000 network to identify the dominant factors that
affect TCP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that looks at cross-layer
measurements in a wireless network. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
1. We conducted extensive active measurements in a commercial CDMA2000 cellular
network to characterize the behavior of the wireless scheduler, and evaluate TCP’s
performance. One of our objectives was to identify the impact of various network
factors on both the wireless scheduler and TCP. Towards this end, we develop a
simple Information Theoretic framework that allows us to quantify how factors
such as channel quality, sector load, etc., affect the wireless scheduler, and how the
scheduler in turn affects TCP.
2. In terms of the wireless scheduler, we exposed the different mechanisms that gov-
ern its operation and identiﬁed the characteristics that inﬂuence its performance. We
concluded that over short timescales (1 second), the wireless scheduler: a) is highly
dependent on buffer backlog, b) is surprisingly insensitive to variations in channel
quality or sector load, and c) has a rate limiting mechanism to maintain fairness
by throttling connections that are being persistently greedy. Over long timescales
(20 minutes), however, the scheduler reduces allocated rate in response to persis-
tently bad channel conditions or high sector load, and is unable to maintain fairness
among concurrent TCP sessions.
3. In terms of TCP, we concluded that: a) there is a tight coupling between the TCP
sending rate and the scheduler. This implies that rate variations, seen by TCP, on
the CDMA channel are not random, b) most of the packet losses seen by TCP
are congestion related, and c) the high variability in channel rate causes frequent
spurious re-transmissions which can be overcome by using the time-stamp option.
4. Finally, as a general observation, we found high variability in TCP throughput
based on the time and day of the experiment. We hypothesize this to be due to
rapid cell dimensioning by network operators.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines the architecture
of a CDMA2000 network and highlights the relevant features. Section 3 presents a
description of the various experiments that we conducted. Section 4 characterizes the
wireless scheduler and quantiﬁes the relative impact of various factors on it. Section 5
presents an evaluation of TCP’s performance. Section 6 presents our conclusions.
Due to lack of space, some characterization details were omitted from this paper.

2 The CDMA2000 1xRTT System
Figure 1(a) depicts the architecture of a typical cellular data network in order to illus-
trate its salient features. The network consists of two main components: a) the data
network which is responsible for operations like managing PPP sessions, IP mobility
and billing, and b) the radio network which manages radio resources. The focus of this
work is on the latter.

The main element of the radio network is the Base Station Controller (BSC), which is
responsible for maintaining the radio session with the mobile device. The BSC controls
hundreds of Base Transceiver Stations (BTS), which are essentially the air interfaces
to the mobile devices, through a low-latency back-haul network. The importance of
the BSC arises from the fact that it hosts two critical components which can directly
affect higher layer performance: a) the wireless scheduler that dynamically controls the
wireless channel rate assigned to the mobile device, and b) the Radio Link Protocol
(RLP) that is responsible for fast MAC layer error recovery through the re-transmission
of radio frames to recover from losses either over the low-latency back-haul connecting
the BSC to the BTS or the wireless channel.
The function of the wireless scheduler is to assign a wireless channel rate (from up
to six discrete rates) to a mobile device on-the-ﬂy. This objective is primarily achieved
by controlling the CDMA code length and channel power. Since higher rates require
more power and resource reservation, the decision on when to allocate higher rates and
to which user, must be made judiciously. In practice, the scheduler’s decision could be
inﬂuenced by three factors, which we investigate in detail in Section 4:
1. The queue length at the BSC (each user is assigned a separate buffer)
2. The channel conditions experienced by the mobile device, which is deﬁned as the
ratio between the received pilot signal strength Ec and the ambient noise and inter-
ference I0, i.e., Ec/I0
3. The number of active users in the same sector (or sector load)
3 Experiments and Data Sets
Our primary focus is on the downlink. We performed end-to-end experiments which
involved data transfer via either UDP or TCP SACK from a RedHat Linux server on
the Internet to one or more laptops running Windows XP that were connected to the
cellular data network via CDMA2000 1xRTT air-cards. A typical experimental setup is
shown in Fig. 1(b) to illustrate the data path1, as well as measurement points.
1 The end-to-end path on average had a: a) propagation delay of 450-550ms, b) 25-35KB bot-
tleneck buffer at BSC, c) 70KB-120KB wireless channel rate, and d) packet loss rate of 0.9%.

The experiments can be categorized into two classes. The ﬁrst class consisted of
sending UDP trafﬁc to characterize the wireless scheduler. UDP was chosen to remove
any transport layer feedback so that the wireless scheduler could be characterized in
isolation. The second class comprised of downloading ﬁles via TCP in order to char-
acterize long term TCP behavior, as well as its dependency on RF factors. These ex-
periments were conducted under different TCP-speciﬁc and wireless conﬁgurations to
evaluate their relative impact and obtain a better understanding of the system.
Each experiment, under every conﬁguration, was run 10 times at various times during
the day to obtain a reasonably large set of samples for statistical characterization. All
plots include error bars denoting the 90% conﬁdence interval around the mean. For TCP
downloads, we used a single ﬁle size of 5MB since we are interested in long-term TCP
behavior. The typical duration of both TCP and UDP ﬂows was 15-20 minutes.
For each experiment, we collected data from the higher layer protocols through stan-
dard UDP/TCP logs at the client (windump) and server (tcpdump), as well as RF layer
information. The RF statistics were collected from two observation points. Messages re-
lated to instantaneous channel quality, frame errors, re-transmissions and the assigned
wireless channel rate were collected at the laptops using an air-interface analysis tool
called CAIT [8]. These messages were aggregated to generate a time-series tracking the
value of the above RF variables at a time-granularity of 1 second. The second source
of measurement was the Per Call Measurement Data (PCMD) obtained from the BSC.
PCMD contains details for all voice and data calls2, such as source/destination phone
numbers, cell/sector ID’s, call duration, number of transmitted bytes, and call suc-
cess/failure information. We used the PCMD logs to infer the number of active sessions
in a sector (i.e., sector load).
4 Wireless Scheduler Characterization
In this section we present an empirical evaluation of the factors that affect the behavior
of the wireless scheduler. The exact implementation details of a commercial 1xRTT
wireless scheduler is proprietary and hence we have to infer its behavior indirectly.
As mentioned in Section 2, channel rates assigned by the wireless scheduler can
be inﬂuenced by the user’s queue length, channel conditions and sector load. To un-
derstand the extent to which each of these factors affects the scheduler’s decisions, we
performed numerous UDP experiments with constant bit-rate (CBR) and ‘on-off’ trafﬁc
sources.
We begin by examining the impact of the application data rate on the wireless sched-
uler. Figure 2 plots the average throughput of a connection as a function of the data send-
ing rate of a UDP CBR trafﬁc source. The ﬁgure indicates that the achieved throughput
tracks the sending rate up to a rate of 50 kbps after which it decreases sharply.
We next study how the assigned channel rate tracks the source’s data rate and empiri-
cally show that the wireless scheduler assigns channel rates by tracking the user’s buffer
backlog over short timescales. Figure 4 plots the source’s data rate and the assigned
channel rate time-series (measured by CAIT) when the source utilizes an ‘on-off’ trafﬁc
pattern. The two ﬁgures show the data sending rate for two different on-rates (38.4kbps

and 76.8kbps) and the same duty cycle (on for 1-second and off for 5-seconds). For the
wireless scheduler to assign the correct channel rates for every 1-second burst of data
transmitted by the sender, it must inspect the buffer backlog (or some function of it) at
least once every second. This implies that the scheduler’s decisions are very sensitive
to the data sending rate determined by the transport and application layers.

Fig. 3. Factors affecting channel rate
Even though Fig. 4 indicates the presence of a strong correlation between the sched-
uler and the buffer backlog, visual identiﬁcation is not always reliable or more impor-
tantly quantiﬁable, which is necessary for comparison. Consequently, we have developed
an Information-Theoretic methodology based on a metric that we refer to as the Normal-
ized Mutual Information to quantify the correlation between two time-series. We explain
the main idea brieﬂy. The Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) measures the amount
of information [4] a time-series X can provide about another time-series Y (taking into
consideration time-shifts between the two sequences). NMI lies between 0 and 1 and the
larger the peak value, the more the two sequences are dependent on each other. NMI is
basically a time-shifted correlation measure that can capture both linear and non-linear
dependencies between time-series. For completeness, NMI is deﬁned as:
IN (X; Y ; d) = (H(X) + H(Y ) − H(X, Yd))/H(X)
(1)
where H(X) denotes the entropy of X, and H(X, Yd) denotes the joint entropy of X
and a version of sequence Y that is time delayed by d time units3.
Armed with this tool, we evaluated the impact of both the channel conditions and the
sector load on the rate decisions made by the wireless scheduler, over short timescales,
when sending UDP CBR trafﬁc. We also computed the NMI between the buffer back-
log and the channel assigned rate time-series for the ‘on-off’ trafﬁc source. Figure 3
presents the peak NMI values indicating the relative impact that all three factors (aver-
aged across all experiments) have on the channel assigned rates.
Quite surprisingly, as evident from the table, we found that the short-term channel
quality and sector load have a very limited impact on the scheduler. We believe this

can be attributed to two reasons: a) fast power control4 deployed in CDMA networks
combats short-term channel ﬂuctuations thus eliminating its impact on rate assignment,
and b) the sector load varies too slowly to have a signiﬁcant short-term impact on the
scheduler’s behavior. In Section 5 we show that these two factors affect long-term av-
erage scheduler behavior. The table also supports our initial observation that the buffer
backlog is the most dominant factor inﬂuencing the scheduler’s decisions.
5 TCP in CDMA2000 Networks
This section is devoted to results related to TCP behavior in experiments that were
conducted under four different conﬁgurations on a commercial CDMA2000 network,
where the following parameters were varied, namely: a) TCP’s advertised receiver win-
dow size (ARWND), b) TCP’s time-stamp option, c) number of active users in the
sector, and d) user mobility (i.e., speed) and location (i.e., channel quality). The ﬁrst
two conﬁgurations are speciﬁc to TCP, while the latter two are more characteristic of
wireless users. Clearly, there are several other variations (e.g. the TCP congestion mech-
anism) that are possible, however, we believe that the conﬁgurations we focused on are
the most fundamental ones. Speciﬁcally, almost all operating systems have support for
modifying TCP’s ARWND and time-stamp options. Similarly, mobility and user loca-
tion are the main characteristics of any wireless network.
Before discussing the experimental results, it is worthwhile making a general obser-
vation regarding our results. In almost all conﬁgurations, we found that the amount
of variation in attained throughput is at least 10% and at times higher than 100%,
even across consecutive runs of the same experiment, depending on location and
time. Our measurements indicate that these variations in capacity were not caused by
the channel quality or sector load. Instead, we believe they may be due to dynamic
cell-dimensioning5 performed by the network operator which is the focus of our future
work.

5.1 TCP Window Size and Time-Stamp Option
The ﬁrst two conﬁgurations we study involve TCP’s behavior as a function of ARWND,
both when the time-stamp option [10] was disabled/enabled. The window size was
varied from 8 KB to 128 KB to control the number of packets in-ﬂight in the network
and hence the bottleneck queue size (equivalently queuing delay). This allowed us to sub-
ject the wireless scheduler to different queuing loads. Also, setting small advertised re-
ceiver windows (particularly ones that are smaller than the bottleneck buffer at the BSC)
allowed us to emulate environments where wireless losses are more prevalent (i.e., no
congestion losses, due to buffer overﬂow, could ever occur). The time-stamp option, on
the other hand, primarily allows the TCP sender to obtain more accurate RTT/RTO esti-
mates which aid in detecting and avoiding spurious re-transmissions. Enabling/disabling
this option allowed us to evaluate its impact on a connection’s performance.
We begin by evaluating the impact of RF factors on a particular aspect of TCP,
the round trip time (RTT). The NMI metric is used to quantify the relative impact of
the RLP re-transmission rate, wireless channel rate, as well as the buffer occupancy
(approximated by the number of un-acknowledged packets in-ﬂight). Table 1 presents
the peak NMI values between the RTT time-series and each of the three factors for a
few different ARWND values. The table clearly indicates that for small and medium
window sizes (8 KB and 16 KB) the wireless channel rate has the strongest inﬂuence
on RTT, while at large window sizes (64 KB), buffer occupancy is high, and hence
queuing delay becomes the dominant component in RTT.
These observations have several implications: a) RLP re-transmissions do not add
signiﬁcant latency, and b) in the absence of queuing, the channel rate determines RTT.
Since RTT directly impacts throughput, we can expect TCP’s throughput to be highly
dependent on the assigned channel rates. This is indeed true as shown in Table 2
which presents the amount of information (NMI) that the channel rate and RLP re-
transmission rate have about TCP’s throughput. We showed previously in Section 4
that the channel rate is inﬂuenced by the transport data rate which implies that there
is a strong coupling between the wireless scheduler and TCP. More importantly, it in-
dicates that the rate variations in the wireless channel are not completely random, as
is commonly assumed in models [1,3]. Instead, the channel’s rate is highly correlated
with TCP’s state and must be taken into consideration in future models, and c) since the
two controllers (TCP and wireless scheduler) take each other as input, this can lead to
oscillations resulting in highly variable RTT, causing spurious re-transmissions.
