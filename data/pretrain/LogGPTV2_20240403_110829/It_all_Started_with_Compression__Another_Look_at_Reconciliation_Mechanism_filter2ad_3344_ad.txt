infrastructure – even though accessible only to whites – in that country and laid the 
foundation for a solid economy as well. In studying the experiences of post conflict 
reconciliation in Sierra Leone, or for that matter other post conflict societies, several 
important questions must, therefore, be asked and answers provided, in order to 
fully appreciate the limitations of the TRC processes in that country. In doing so, 
it is important to note that even in the best of times, Sierra Leone, a mini state, was 
highly porous and depended overwhelmingly on the good will of the donor com-
munity for its survival. Again, it is important to stress that even in geographical 
terms, Sierra Leone is the sixth smallest country in Africa, a fact that has sombre 
implications for its capacity to “go it alone” in many spheres of state activity even in 
peace time. The devastating effects of the fratricidal war accentuated the country’s 
external dependence and called into serious question its ability to fully implement a 
TRC process successfully, a fact that has been overlooked in the main literature.2

7. The sierra Leone Trc: Matters arising
What  have  been  the  experiences  of  Sierra  Leone  in  post  conflict  reconciliation? 
What institutions and processes, if any, were put in place to heal the sore wounds 
of long years of “uncivil” war, trauma and impunity, and how successful have they 
been?  Can  there  be  effective  reconciliation  in  Sierra  Leone  without  punishment 
for perpetrators? Indeed can telling the truth lead alone to national reconciliation 
in  post  conflict  Sierra  Leone?  Is  reconciliation  between  perpetrators  and  victims 
a  straight  road  or  a  “spaghetti”  junction  that  is  full  of  dangerous  challenges  for 
perpetrators, victims and government? Is reconciliation “a once and for all” act or 
along a continuum?1 Who is to be reconciled with whom: is it the perpetrators with 
individual victims or vice versa, perpetrators and their communities and neighbour-
hoods? Where the victims are children is reconciliation possible between them and 
perpetrators or, is it between the perpetrators and third parties, i.e. parents, extended 
family members, etc? If the latter, can we really speak of “reconciliation” as such in 
the “absence” of the victims, and what are the consequences for the success of such 
a methodology for victims, their families and long-term national peace and stabil-
ity? How do we reconcile perpetrators and victims within the same family; women 
with men, men with men, children with parents, etc? What has been the role of civil 
society, government and the international community in the reconciliation proc-
ess? What are the perceptions of the reconciliation processes by various segments of 
society in Sierra Leone? The last question is important because ultimately, it is the 
public, the ordinary man and woman, youth and child in the country that bore the 
brunt of the war and it is they, more than any other person, or group, who should 
also know “where the shoe pinches most”. It is arguable that whether national recon-
ciliation and healing in the country succeeds or not would depend on how the Sierra 
Leonean “public” feels about the entire process; especially as the “public” harbours 
both perpetrators and victims, the communities and families which are so critical 
to the success of post conflict peace and stability in the country. What are the chal-
lenges faced by Sierra Leone, a country that is still under “international receiver-
ship” and “reconstruction” and what are the implications of such challenges for the 
reconciliation processes? These are pertinent questions that must be answered in 
any discussion on the post conflict reconciliation efforts in Sierra Leone, or for that 
matter, other countries emerging from protracted conflicts. 
Before we turn our attention to these vital queries, it is pertinent to note that 
the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission was in many ways a child 
of circumstance, being born at a very difficult time in the civil war and against the 
backdrop of a frantic search by the international community and local stakehold-

ers for an immediate end to hostilities. Created under the Lome Peace Agreement 
of July 7 19991, and months later, in February 2000, by an Act of the Sierra Leone 
Parliament, the TRC was a bold attempt to placate both the victims and perpetra-
tors. It was in fact advertised to Sierra Leoneans as a veritable mechanism capable 
of “healing” the deep wounds of the war. Article XXVI (1) of the Lome Agreement 
states that a:
…Truth and Reconciliation Commission shall be established to address impunity, 
break the cycle of violence, provide a forum for both the victims and perpetrators of 
human rights violations to tell their story, get a clear picture of the past in order to 
facilitate genuine healing and reconciliation.
According to Part III, section 6(1) of the TRC Act: 
The object for which the Commission is established is to create an impartial histori-
cal record of violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian 
law related to the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from the beginning of the conflict 
in 11 to the signing of the Lome Peace Agreement; to address impunity, to respond 
to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation and to prevent a 
repetition of the violations and abuses suffered. 
In addition, the Commission was also to 
…investigate and report on the causes, nature and extent of the violations and abus-
es…to work to restore the human dignity of victims and promote reconciliation by 
providing an opportunity for victims to give an account of the violations and abuses 
suffered and for the perpetrators to relate their experiences, and creating a climate 
which  fosters  constructive  interchange  between  victims  and  perpetrators,  giving 
special attention to the subject of sexual abuses and to the experiences of children 
within the armed conflict…
Finally, the report of the Commission was to contain 
Recommendation concerning the reforms and other measures, whether legal, po-
litical, administrative or otherwise needed to achieve the object of the commission, 
namely the object of providing impartial historical record, preventing the repeti-
tion of the violations or abuses suffered, addressing the impunity, responding to the 
needs of the victims and promoting healing and reconciliation. 
In the next section, some of the problematic assumptions that informed the choice 
of the TRC as an instrument of post conflict reconciliation in Sierra Leone will be 
unmasked.

8. challenging assumptions of Trcs and post conflict reconciliation in  
     sierra Leone
One of the most important assumptions that informed the setting up of the TRC 
in Sierra Leone, like elsewhere in Africa, is that truth would lead to national rec-
onciliation by enabling victims to confront the perpetrators, after which they were 
expected to forgive them and move on with their lives. This assumption is reminis-
cent of the biblical injunction about forgiving trespasses –in the same way God for-
gives our sins we should forgive those of others. From such a perspective, the TRC 
certainly struck a familiar chord that is in line with the forgiveness that individuals 
seek from God for their transgressions, no matter how grievous they may be, and the 
expectation that God in His infinite mercy will forgive sinners who genuinely and 
openly admit their transgressions. In Christianity and other faiths, it is also believed 
that complete forgiveness of sins is possible and that absolution paves the way for the 
erstwhile sinner to gain the kingdom of God in the hereafter. 
While this study does not pretend to question the capacity of God to totally 
forgive sins and other earthly trespasses, it is not clear if human beings are capable 
of such full forgiveness especially over matters concerning war crimes. For instance, 
is  it  possible  for  an  individual  that  has  lost  both  hands  to  crude  amputation  in 
Sierra Leone to forgive the perpetrators? Even if it were possible to do so, under 
what circumstances would it be sustained? Clearly, the theoretical and philosophical 
underpinnings of the TRC tend to expect, and indeed extract, too much from the 
individual, especially the victim, without cast-iron guarantees of appropriate mate-
rial and non-material rewards. This explains why coming to terms with the past 
and coping with future challenges would largely depend on individuals’ wartime 
experiences on the one hand, and the post conflict circumstances they face, on the 
other, i.e. a victim’s physical, material, health/mental state and needs etc. How then, 
can victims (individuals or groups) be encouraged to forgive and forget, and come to 
terms with their present state and the future? Finally, since reconciliation takes place 
at several levels in post conflict societies, it is necessary to understand these multiple 
layers and their intricate linkages to post conflict reconciliation processes. 
What is incontrovertible, though, is that the requirements of reconciliation in 
the spiritual kingdom are significantly different from those in the political, mate-
rial, and social realms. In the spiritual kingdom, reconciliation is perceived as tran-
scending the materialism of this transient world and assures transgressors or sinners 
eternal bliss, a world of abundance and self-contentment. Unfortunately, that is by 
no means the case in the hard reality of the political and material world in which 
we live. Beyond the spiritual realm, then, reconciliation requires taking cognizance 
of the materialism of this ephemeral world, if it is to succeed. In the material and 
physical dominion, the expectations of victims are governed by hard political and 
economic  calculations,  opportunity  costs  and  sometimes,  even  double  speak,  by 
2

prominent political office holders that often do not reflect the reality of street condi-
tions. This point was recognized by the then Interim President of Liberia, Gyude 
Bryant when he noted publicly, that “…it is difficult to talk about grace when you 
have no food and you are hungry and cannot feed your children and everything you 
have has been looted”.1 Accordingly, coming to terms with the past and accepting 
future challenges should be much easier when the diverse physical and social needs 
of  victims  and  perpetrators  are  effectively  catered  for.  Put  differently,  it  is  much 
easier to “heal” the wounds of victims of violence in coping with their situations 
if listening to the “truth” and accepting an apology based on the “truth” are also 
backed by “material justice’. Unfortunately, Truth Commissions and indeed, most 
post conflict governments, do not always make such cast-iron guarantees to victims. 
Besides,  if  TRCs  are  perceived  as  providing  significant  signposts  as  well  as  “first 
aid kits” on the tortuous road to national reconciliation after violent conflicts, then 
there must be ways of measuring their overall success. Regrettably, experience has 
shown that that has not always been easy to do, for success or failure may be subject 
to several personal considerations and extraneous factors. Even in South Africa, the 
overall achievements of the trail blazer, the South African TRC, are still controver-
sial.2 
Even if the Sierra Leone State were inclined towards providing material and 
other forms of compensation to victims, in theory, it would be difficult to do so in 
practice since the state/country is itself a “work in progress”, depending overwhelm-
ing on input from and control by the international community. In such a state of 
affairs, the government or the state is hardly in a position to determine the pace or 
priorities of the “construction project” in a way that would ensure long-term peace, 
security and stability.  Finally, it is possible that the TRC and even the Special Court 
might have been used as part of an elaborate “exit strategy” for the guarantors of the 
peace processes that led to the end of hostilities in 2000. If this suspicion is correct, 
it  raises  serious  questions  on  both  its  appropriateness  and  capacity  to  contribute 
positively to important ancillary processes that could stimulate national reconcilia-
tion in the country. 
Apart  from  the  above  difficulties,  other  important  questions  have  also  been 
raised to challenge the very theoretical foundations of TRCs. Rosalind Shaw, for 
instance, notes that it cannot be assumed that “Truth telling is healing on a personal 
level:  truth  Commissions  do  not  constitute  therapy”.3  Shaw  even  questioned  the 
whole essence of telling the truth as a national healing process:

The idea of healing a nation that is wounded or traumatized is primarily a nation-
building rhetoric…[it] derives from nineteenth century models of society as akin to 
an organism that can be healthy or sick. Such biological models for society have, 
however, long been discredited. While violence certainly disrupts and transforms 
social institutions and practices, it is not valid to conceptualize these changes in 
terms of a damaged collective national psyche that can be healed through a cathartic 
process of truth telling (Shaw 2005).
In a similar vein, Michael Ignatieff also queried the logic of Bishop Tutu’s assump-
tion “…that a nation has a psyche, not many, that truth is one, not many, that truth 
is certain, not contestable; and that when it is known by all, it has capacity to heal 
and reconcile…” (Hartwell 2000). This point is worth emphasizing further because 
according to Brandon Hamber: 
…it is a mistake to assume that story telling and giving testimony, either in public or 
private spaces, equates with healing. Truth alone will not lead to reconciliation nor 
will it guarantee that a human rights culture will permeate the society and that those 
who suffered in the past will be able to deal with their traumas (Hartwell 2000).
No doubt, the civil war in Sierra Leone, or for those matter that in Liberia and other 
African countries since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, impacted differently 
on individuals, groups and communities. Accordingly, dealing with the past suc-
cessfully, and coming to terms with the challenges of the future also vary. Whatever 
the case may be, it is our contention that coming to terms to terms with the past and 
accepting future challenges would be much easier if the material, psychological and 
other special needs of victims and even perpetrators are also catered for in the post 
conflict dispensation both in the short and long-term.
Not only that, even the timing of the reconciliation processes and institutions 
may be critical to their success or failure. For instance, at what point should a TRC 
be put in place, even if there is widespread agreement that it is desirable? Is it before 
or  after  economic  and  political  reconstruction  has  been  effected  in  the  war-torn 
country? In this respect, what would happen to the reconciliation processes in states 
that are heavily dependent on external goodwill to function? If external funding 
were to suddenly stop in such a state, what would be the fate of the TRC processes 
and future of the state itself?  Unfortunately, the highlights of typical TRC docu-
ments are usually not very helpful in finding answers to these vital questions, since 
they tend to present a rather simplistic understanding of very complicated phenom-
ena. Under such conditions, experience is perhaps the best teacher and guide. For as 
Beth Dougherty has convincingly posited, even if the TRC in Sierra Leone or any 
other country were to produce an excellent report and recommendations, “there is 
no guarantee that the political will, financial resources, or administrative capacity 
2
A m a d u   S e s a y
will be available to implement them”.1 Even the incurable cynic would therefore be 
forgiven for asking the question: then why bother at all?
The next section focuses attention on the perceptions of the public in Sierra 
Leone’s capital, Freetown, of the usefulness of the Truth Commission in promoting 
national reconciliation and long-term peace and stability in the country. By doing 
so, it is hoped that our earlier discussion on the country’s past and contemporary 
experience, will shed more light on the utility as well as the limitations of TRCs as 
a “first aid” tool in the post-conflict peace building continuum, whether in Sierra 
Leone or elsewhere in Africa in the future. Thus, what are the broad and specific 
perceptions of the TRC across the spectrum of stakeholders in Sierra Leone: the 
elites,  political,  traditional  and  religious  leaders;  members  of  the  general  public, 
women, youth, victims and perpetrators? What in their views are the major fault-
lines in the task of promoting reconciliation in the country, or even the limitations 
of the Commission in the judgment of the public? What are the victims’ perceptions 
of the reconciliation processes? Would the public have preferred local mechanisms 
for reconciling perpetrators and victims? What is the perception of stakeholders of 
the ability of the state in Sierra Leone to meet the material and other commitments 
consequent upon the TRC processes? What are the indispensable strategic ingredi-
ents for the success of the TRC from the perspective of members of the public in 
Sierra Leone? 
9. Perceptions of Trc processes in sierra Leone
This section is based on data obtained during the field work in Freetown early in 
2006, with a view to finding out what the general perceptions of the TRC processes 
were.  Respondents  were  divided  into  four  broad  categories  of  Sierra  Leoneans  as 
follows:
i) the elites/political leaders, ii) members of the general public, iii) traditional 
leaders and iv) religious leaders. In terms of the socio-demographic characteristics of 
respondents, 71.8% of the elites were males, and 58.1% of members of the public, 
were males. Taken as a whole, 63.4% of all respondents were males while 36.6% of 
the total sample was female (Figure 1).
The majority of the respondents among the elites, 69.2%, were married while 
61.3% of members of the public were single. In the total sample, there were more 
single, 49.5%, than married, 46.5%, respondents (Figure 2).
