### Infrastructure and Economic Foundations in Post-Conflict Societies

Despite being accessible only to whites, the infrastructure in that country laid the foundation for a robust economy. When examining post-conflict reconciliation in Sierra Leone, or in other post-conflict societies, several critical questions must be addressed to fully understand the limitations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) processes. It is essential to note that even during its best times, Sierra Leone, a small state, was highly porous and heavily dependent on the goodwill of the donor community for its survival. Geographically, Sierra Leone is the sixth smallest country in Africa, which has significant implications for its capacity to operate independently in many areas, even in peacetime. The fratricidal war's devastating effects further exacerbated the country's external dependence, raising serious questions about its ability to successfully implement the TRC process, a fact often overlooked in the main literature.1

### Post-Conflict Reconciliation in Sierra Leone: Matters Arising

What have been the experiences of Sierra Leone in post-conflict reconciliation? What institutions and processes, if any, were established to heal the deep wounds of years of "uncivil" war, trauma, and impunity, and how effective have they been? Can there be effective reconciliation in Sierra Leone without punishing perpetrators? Can truth-telling alone lead to national reconciliation in post-conflict Sierra Leone? Is reconciliation between perpetrators and victims a straightforward process or a complex one fraught with challenges for all parties involved? Is reconciliation a one-time event or a continuous process? Who should be reconciled with whom: individual victims with perpetrators, or perpetrators with their communities and neighborhoods? If the victims are children, is reconciliation possible between them and the perpetrators, or should it involve third parties such as parents and extended family members? If the latter, can we truly speak of "reconciliation" in the absence of the victims, and what are the consequences for the success of such a methodology for victims, their families, and long-term national peace and stability? How do we reconcile perpetrators and victims within the same family, women with men, men with men, and children with parents? What role have civil society, the government, and the international community played in the reconciliation process? How do various segments of Sierra Leonean society perceive the reconciliation processes?

The last question is crucial because ultimately, it is the public—ordinary men, women, youth, and children—who bore the brunt of the war and who should also know "where the shoe pinches most." Whether national reconciliation and healing succeed or fail will depend on how the Sierra Leonean public feels about the entire process, especially since the public includes both perpetrators and victims, and the communities and families critical to post-conflict peace and stability. What are the challenges faced by Sierra Leone, a country still under "international receivership" and "reconstruction," and what are the implications of these challenges for the reconciliation processes? These are pertinent questions that must be addressed in any discussion on post-conflict reconciliation efforts in Sierra Leone or other countries emerging from protracted conflicts.

### The Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission: A Child of Circumstance

Before delving into these vital queries, it is important to note that the Sierra Leone Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was, in many ways, a product of its circumstances, born at a very difficult time during the civil war and amid a frantic search by the international community and local stakeholders for an immediate end to hostilities. Created under the Lomé Peace Agreement of July 7, 1999, and later, in February 2000, by an Act of the Sierra Leone Parliament, the TRC was a bold attempt to placate both victims and perpetrators. It was advertised to Sierra Leoneans as a mechanism capable of "healing" the deep wounds of the war. Article XXVI (1) of the Lomé Agreement states:

"A Truth and Reconciliation Commission shall be established to address impunity, break the cycle of violence, provide a forum for both the victims and perpetrators of human rights violations to tell their story, get a clear picture of the past in order to facilitate genuine healing and reconciliation."

According to Part III, section 6(1) of the TRC Act:

"The object for which the Commission is established is to create an impartial historical record of violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law related to the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from the beginning of the conflict in 1991 to the signing of the Lomé Peace Agreement; to address impunity, to respond to the needs of the victims, to promote healing and reconciliation and to prevent a repetition of the violations and abuses suffered."

Additionally, the Commission was to:

"Investigate and report on the causes, nature, and extent of the violations and abuses... to work to restore the human dignity of victims and promote reconciliation by providing an opportunity for victims to give an account of the violations and abuses suffered and for the perpetrators to relate their experiences, and creating a climate which fosters constructive interchange between victims and perpetrators, giving special attention to the subject of sexual abuses and to the experiences of children within the armed conflict..."

Finally, the report of the Commission was to contain:

"Recommendations concerning the reforms and other measures, whether legal, political, administrative, or otherwise needed to achieve the object of the commission, namely the object of providing an impartial historical record, preventing the repetition of the violations or abuses suffered, addressing the impunity, responding to the needs of the victims, and promoting healing and reconciliation."

In the next section, some of the problematic assumptions that informed the choice of the TRC as an instrument of post-conflict reconciliation in Sierra Leone will be examined.

### Challenging Assumptions of TRCs and Post-Conflict Reconciliation in Sierra Leone

One of the most significant assumptions underlying the establishment of the TRC in Sierra Leone, as in other African countries, is that truth would lead to national reconciliation by enabling victims to confront perpetrators, after which they were expected to forgive them and move on with their lives. This assumption echoes the biblical injunction about forgiving trespasses—in the same way God forgives our sins, we should forgive those of others. From this perspective, the TRC struck a familiar chord, aligning with the forgiveness individuals seek from God for their transgressions, no matter how grievous, and the expectation that God, in His infinite mercy, will forgive sinners who genuinely and openly admit their transgressions. In Christianity and other faiths, it is believed that complete forgiveness of sins is possible and that absolution paves the way for the sinner to gain the kingdom of God in the hereafter.

While this study does not question the capacity of God to forgive sins and other earthly trespasses, it is unclear whether humans are capable of such full forgiveness, especially regarding war crimes. For example, is it possible for an individual who has lost both hands due to crude amputation in Sierra Leone to forgive the perpetrators? Even if it were possible, under what circumstances could such forgiveness be sustained? The theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of the TRC tend to expect, and indeed extract, too much from the individual, especially the victim, without cast-iron guarantees of appropriate material and non-material rewards. This explains why coming to terms with the past and coping with future challenges largely depends on individuals' wartime experiences and the post-conflict circumstances they face, such as their physical, material, health, and mental state and needs. How, then, can victims (individuals or groups) be encouraged to forgive and forget, and come to terms with their present state and the future? Finally, since reconciliation occurs at multiple levels in post-conflict societies, it is necessary to understand these layers and their intricate linkages to post-conflict reconciliation processes.

What is incontrovertible, though, is that the requirements of reconciliation in the spiritual kingdom are significantly different from those in the political, material, and social realms. In the spiritual realm, reconciliation transcends the materialism of this transient world and assures transgressors or sinners eternal bliss, a world of abundance, and self-contentment. Unfortunately, that is not the case in the hard reality of the political and material world in which we live. Beyond the spiritual realm, reconciliation requires taking cognizance of the materialism of this ephemeral world to succeed. In the material and physical dominion, the expectations of victims are governed by hard political and economic calculations, opportunity costs, and sometimes, even double-speak by prominent political office holders that often do not reflect the reality of street conditions. This point was recognized by the then Interim President of Liberia, Gyude Bryant, when he noted publicly, "It is difficult to talk about grace when you have no food and you are hungry and cannot feed your children and everything you have has been looted."1 Accordingly, coming to terms with the past and accepting future challenges should be much easier when the diverse physical and social needs of victims and perpetrators are effectively catered for. Put differently, it is much easier to "heal" the wounds of victims of violence in coping with their situations if listening to the "truth" and accepting an apology based on the "truth" are also backed by "material justice." Unfortunately, Truth Commissions and most post-conflict governments do not always make such cast-iron guarantees to victims. Besides, if TRCs are perceived as providing significant signposts and "first aid kits" on the tortuous road to national reconciliation after violent conflicts, then there must be ways of measuring their overall success. Regrettably, experience has shown that this is not always easy, as success or failure may be subject to several personal considerations and extraneous factors. Even in South Africa, the overall achievements of the trailblazer, the South African TRC, remain controversial.2

Even if the Sierra Leone State were inclined towards providing material and other forms of compensation to victims, in theory, it would be difficult to do so in practice, as the state/country is itself a "work in progress," depending overwhelmingly on input from and control by the international community. In such a state of affairs, the government or the state is hardly in a position to determine the pace or priorities of the "construction project" in a way that would ensure long-term peace, security, and stability. Finally, it is possible that the TRC and even the Special Court might have been used as part of an elaborate "exit strategy" for the guarantors of the peace processes that led to the end of hostilities in 2000. If this suspicion is correct, it raises serious questions about both its appropriateness and capacity to contribute positively to important ancillary processes that could stimulate national reconciliation in the country.

Apart from the above difficulties, other important questions have also been raised to challenge the very theoretical foundations of TRCs. Rosalind Shaw, for instance, notes that it cannot be assumed that "Truth-telling is healing on a personal level: Truth Commissions do not constitute therapy."3 Shaw even questioned the whole essence of telling the truth as a national healing process:

"The idea of healing a nation that is wounded or traumatized is primarily a nation-building rhetoric... [it] derives from nineteenth-century models of society as akin to an organism that can be healthy or sick. Such biological models for society have, however, long been discredited. While violence certainly disrupts and transforms social institutions and practices, it is not valid to conceptualize these changes in terms of a damaged collective national psyche that can be healed through a cathartic process of truth-telling (Shaw 2005)."

In a similar vein, Michael Ignatieff also queried the logic of Bishop Tutu's assumption "...that a nation has a psyche, not many, that truth is one, not many, that truth is certain, not contestable; and that when it is known by all, it has the capacity to heal and reconcile..." (Hartwell 2000). This point is worth emphasizing further because, according to Brandon Hamber:

"...it is a mistake to assume that storytelling and giving testimony, either in public or private spaces, equates with healing. Truth alone will not lead to reconciliation nor will it guarantee that a human rights culture will permeate the society and that those who suffered in the past will be able to deal with their traumas (Hartwell 2000)."

No doubt, the civil war in Sierra Leone, or in Liberia and other African countries since the end of the Cold War in the 1990s, impacted individuals, groups, and communities differently. Accordingly, dealing with the past successfully and coming to terms with the challenges of the future also vary. Whatever the case may be, it is our contention that coming to terms with the past and accepting future challenges would be much easier if the material, psychological, and other special needs of victims and even perpetrators are also catered for in the post-conflict dispensation, both in the short and long term.

Not only that, but the timing of the reconciliation processes and institutions may be critical to their success or failure. For instance, at what point should a TRC be put in place, even if there is widespread agreement that it is desirable? Is it before or after economic and political reconstruction has been effected in the war-torn country? In this respect, what would happen to the reconciliation processes in states that are heavily dependent on external goodwill to function? If external funding were to suddenly stop in such a state, what would be the fate of the TRC processes and the future of the state itself? Unfortunately, the highlights of typical TRC documents are usually not very helpful in finding answers to these vital questions, as they tend to present a rather simplistic understanding of very complicated phenomena. Under such conditions, experience is perhaps the best teacher and guide. As Beth Dougherty has convincingly posited, even if the TRC in Sierra Leone or any other country were to produce an excellent report and recommendations, "there is no guarantee that the political will, financial resources, or administrative capacity will be available to implement them."1 Even the incurable cynic would therefore be forgiven for asking the question: then why bother at all?

The next section focuses on the perceptions of the public in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, of the usefulness of the Truth Commission in promoting national reconciliation and long-term peace and stability in the country. By doing so, it is hoped that our earlier discussion on the country's past and contemporary experience will shed more light on the utility and limitations of TRCs as a "first aid" tool in the post-conflict peacebuilding continuum, whether in Sierra Leone or elsewhere in Africa in the future. Thus, what are the broad and specific perceptions of the TRC across the spectrum of stakeholders in Sierra Leone: the elites, political, traditional, and religious leaders; members of the general public, women, youth, victims, and perpetrators? What, in their views, are the major fault lines in the task of promoting reconciliation in the country, or even the limitations of the Commission in the judgment of the public? What are the victims' perceptions of the reconciliation processes? Would the public have preferred local mechanisms for reconciling perpetrators and victims? What is the perception of stakeholders of the ability of the state in Sierra Leone to meet the material and other commitments consequent upon the TRC processes? What are the indispensable strategic ingredients for the success of the TRC from the perspective of members of the public in Sierra Leone?

### Perceptions of TRC Processes in Sierra Leone

This section is based on data obtained during fieldwork in Freetown early in 2006, with the aim of determining the general perceptions of the TRC processes. Respondents were divided into four broad categories of Sierra Leoneans: i) elites/political leaders, ii) members of the general public, iii) traditional leaders, and iv) religious leaders. In terms of socio-demographic characteristics, 71.8% of the elites were males, and 58.1% of members of the public were males. Overall, 63.4% of all respondents were males, while 36.6% were females (Figure 1).

The majority of the respondents among the elites, 69.2%, were married, while 61.3% of members of the public were single. In the total sample, there were more single, 49.5%, than married, 46.5%, respondents (Figure 2).
