# count_distinctif() (aggregation function) - (preview)
Conditionally counts unique values specified by the scalar expression per summary group, or the total number of unique values if the summary group is omitted. Only records for which *predicate* evaluates to `true` are counted.
[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note](../../includes/data-explorer-agg-function-summarize-note.md)]
If you only need an estimation of unique values count, we recommend using the less resource-consuming [dcountif](dcountif-aggregation-function.md) aggregation function.
> [!NOTE]
>
> * This function is limited to 100M unique values. An attempt to apply the function on an expression returning too many values will produce a runtime error (HRESULT: 0x80DA0012).
> * Function performance can be degraded when operating on multiple data sources from different clusters.
## Syntax
`count_distinctif` `(`*expr*`,` *predicate*`)`
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Parameters
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|--|--|--|--|
| *expr*| scalar |  :heavy_check_mark: | The expression whose unique values are to be counted. |
| *predicate* | `string` |  :heavy_check_mark: | The expression used to filter records to be aggregated. |
## Returns
Integer value indicating the number of unique values of *expr* per summary group, for all records for which the *predicate* evaluates to `true`.
## Example
This example shows how many types of death-causing storm events happened in each state. Only storm events with a nonzero count of deaths will be counted.
> [!div class="nextstepaction"]
> Run the query
```kusto
StormEvents
| summarize UniqueFatalEvents=count_distinctif(EventType,(DeathsDirect + DeathsIndirect)>0) by State
| where UniqueFatalEvents > 0
| top 5 by UniqueFatalEvents
```
**Output**
| State           | UniqueFatalEvents |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| TEXAS           | 12                |
| CALIFORNIA      | 12                |
| OKLAHOMA        | 10                |
| NEW YORK        | 9                 |
| KANSAS          | 9                 |
