User: I need to check how much time passed since last user input occurence (preffered way - in python) on Linux (lucid - 10.4)
I know that this is easy in normal way (just using XScreenSaverQueryInfo), but the tricky part is that I don't have x11/extensions/scrnsaver.h header and I HAVE to do that some other way (even if I install needed package I cannot install packeges on 100 other computers on which it will work - I don't have permission to do that).
Assistant: In deps of internet I found something like this, and it looks like working - but still not perfect solution because it returns much more info than I need and also the number near which is proper value is not constant (it differs in other system):
 ls -l /dev/pts | fgrep username
