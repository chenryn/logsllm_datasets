Hello,
I have generated a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/coderslay/fyDkD/6/show/
In this i see that when we drag and drop the pegman anywhere on the google map
then we get the streetview. The street view is not proper only in Firefox
browser. Also i have seen that if the difference between width and height is
considerably large then we can see the issue very easily. The img of street
view is not showing properly. This happens only if we use bootstrap along with
google maps. Else it workd fine. Can you provide a fix or a solution for this.
