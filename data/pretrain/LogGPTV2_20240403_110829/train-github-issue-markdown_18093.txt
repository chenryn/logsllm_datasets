I can't explain the difference between the two arrays built via the
comprehension syntax.
    julia> [a for a in ntuple(3, i -> i)]
    3-element Array{Any,1}:
     1
     2
     3
    julia> xdump(ntuple(3, i -> i))
    (Int64,Int64,Int64) (1,2,3)
    julia> ntuple(3, i -> i) === (1, 2, 3)
    julia> [a for a in (1, 2, 3)]
    3-element Array{Int64,1}:
     1
     2
     3
