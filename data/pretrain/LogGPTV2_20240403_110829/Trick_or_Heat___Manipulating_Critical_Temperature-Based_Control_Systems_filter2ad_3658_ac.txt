control systems blindly trust temperature sensor readings to make
automated decisions, which allows adversaries to exploit and abuse
them for causing unintended consequences.
Many of the systems we test have external temperature sensor
probes that need to be deployed to measure the temperature of a
specific environment. Usually, the wiring and interfaces of systems
with external sensors could make the system more susceptible to
our attacks. Devices with internal temperature sensors might be
less susceptible but can still be affected. For instance, the UVP HB-
500 hybridization oven is covered by metal panels and most part
of the internal sensor wire is protected by additional aluminum
foil, but we notice that small gaps between the metal panels could
allow EMI signals to pass through and be picked up by internal
cables or PCB traces. In addition, control panels of many devices can
allow EMI signals to enter the system. The control panels consist
of various user interface components such as screens, buttons and
lights; EMI signals could pass through the spaces between these
components. Moreover, the cables connected to components in the
control panel or peripheral devices could also pick up EMI signals
and might conduct the signals into possible injection points of the
victim temperature sensing circuitry.
Experimental Settings. The maximum transmitting power of our
equipment is 36 dBm, which is equivalent to 4 W. We use a ZHL-
4240 amplifier that has an average gain of about 44 dB in the range
of 10 MHz to 2 GHz [17]. The signal source is an Agilent N5172B
vector signal generator. We use a directional antenna [19] that has
a length of 0.5 m to emit sinusoidal EMI signals with frequencies
above 300 MHz, and an extendable dipole antenna for frequencies
below 300 MHz. For most of the devices, we sweep through 300
MHz to 1 GHz with an interval of 10 MHz and observe the temper-
ature measurement of the device to find the attack frequencies. We
then adjust the frequency with a step of 1 MHz to find the optimal

attack frequency. If we could not find the attack frequencies for a
device in this range, we would sweep through the frequency ranges
of 10 to 300 MHz and 1 to 2 GHz. In Table 1, we record the maximum
increase or decrease that can be induced in the temperature meas-
urement of the target system and corresponding EMI frequencies
with an attack distance of 0.1 m. For the Inkbird ITC-100VH and
ITC-100RH controllers, the manipulated temperature can exceed
the maximum temperature range of the device at an attack distance
of 0.1 m. We also record the maximum horizontal distance between
the antenna and the target device that a change of 0.5 ◦C can be
induced in the temperature measurement. For several devices, the
maximum attack distance is out of the dimension of our room setup,
so we estimate the maximum distance based on our indoor meas-
urements and the relationship between the induced temperature
change and the attack distance (From Equations 2 and 3, we have

5.1 Medical Applications
Infant Incubator. Newborn infants regulate body temper-

ature much less efficiently than adults [1]. Infant incubators are
critical medical devices widely used in neonatal care units. These
incubators help maintain the thermal stability of infants - especially
preterm or sick newborns [6, 28, 65]. The temperature inside the
cabin of incubators is measured and adjusted, via a closed-loop
temperature control system, to reside within an ideal preset tem-
perature range, minimizing the risks of morbidity and mortality
[8, 59, 78].
To maintain the infant in a Neutral Thermal Environment (NTE
[25]), the closed-loop temperature control system in incubators can
operate in skin servocontrol mode (skin-mode) or air temperature
control mode (air-mode). The skin-mode is designed to maintain
the neonate’s abdominal skin temperature constant, whereas the
air-mode is based on the control of the circulating incubator air
temperature [34]. The simplest way to achieve a thermoneutral
environment is to maintain a constant abdominal skin temperature
between 36.0◦C and 36.5◦C, in the skin-mode. This range minimizes
the number of calories needed to maintain normal body temperature
and reduces the risks of cold stress or overheating [30]. Usually,
NTC thermistors are used in infant incubators to measure the skin

or air temperature and provide real-time feedback to the closed-loop
temperature control system.
To find out whether the temperature control system of an infant
incubator can be maliciously controlled and abused by adversaries
to cause safety issues, we investigate our attacks on an Air-Shields
Isolette C100 infant incubator [13]. We observe that the chassis of
the incubator is shielded with aluminum panels. However, the large
control panel, sensor interfaces, and air circulation holes on the
chassis could still allow EMI signals to enter and affect the internal
system components. In our experiments, we aim the antenna to
the front control panel of the infant incubator. However, attacks
from other directions are also possible (e.g., targeting the back of
the chassis from an adjacent room).
Using a transmitting power of 4 W, our attack can maliciously
control the skin temperature sensor measurement of the infant
incubator with certain attack distances. As shown in Fig. 10, an
adversary can increase the skin temperature measurement by 8.5◦C
or decrease it by 4.3◦C from 1 m away with attack frequencies of 515
MHz and 910 MHz respectively. Additionally, the air temperature
sensor measurement of the incubator could also be affected by the
attack, but the amount of the induced change is less significant
(about 1.5◦C at an attack distance of 0.2 m). To understand possible
attack distances that can cause safety threats in the incubator with a
certain transmitting power, we measure the maximum increase and
decrease that can be achieved with different attack distances using
a transmitting power of 4 W (Fig. 11). We observe that when we
change the distance, the optimal attack frequency deviates slightly

would try to compensate for the induced temperature change to
maintain the “preset temperature" by actuating the heaters.
To avoid being detected by the preset temperature alarm, ad-
versaries can increase the transmitting power slowly and maintain
the difference between the measured and preset temperature less
than 1◦C. Adversaries can manipulate the system to reach and keep
the maximum temperature of 38.5◦C without triggering the high
temperature alarm. This excessive temperature can result in hy-
perthermia in newborns with consequent dehydration, lethargy,
seizures, apnea, increased risks of neurologic injury, etc. [8, 49].
Cooling Attacks. There is no automatic alarm to be triggered
in the incubator if the cabin temperature drops below a specific
minimum threshold. As a result, with an attack distance of 1 m, an
adversary that uses a transmitting power of 4 W can manipulate the
incubator to decrease the actual temperature from the preset 36◦C to
29◦C, which is close to the room temperature during our experiment.
Adversaries trick the infant incubator to actuate the cooling system
by increasing the skin temperature measurement maliciously. For
instance, with an attack distance of 2 m, an adversary can increase
the skin temperature measurement by 4.2◦C (Fig. 11). Using the
same setup as the heating attack, an adversary in the adjacent room
can increase the skin temperature measurement by 3.4◦C.
Moderate hypothermia occurs when the auxiliary temperature
of an infant drops below 34.9◦C and severe hypothermia can be
caused when it drops below 32◦C [8]. As we demonstrate, the attack
can manipulate the infant incubator to decrease the actual temper-
ature to the room temperature such as 29◦C without triggering
any alarm in the incubator system. The compromised incubator
system would put the newborn at risks of serious and potentially
life-threatening complications such as hypoxia, acidosis, cardiores-
piratory and neurological complications, etc. [8, 59].
In our experiments, the time necessary to manipulate the incub-
ator to raise the actual air temperature of the cabin to 38.5◦C is less
than 10 minutes; and it takes about 30 minutes to drop the actual
temperature to below 32◦C. Nurses usually check and record the
axillary temperature of newborns at a specific interval. Four hourly
is the general recommended interval [25, 44]. When instability oc-
curs, the interval can be every 30 to 60 minutes [25, 44]. Adversaries
could exploit these intervals to pursue the attack.
5.1.2 Traceable Thermometers with Alarms. Traceable thermomet-
ers that provide highly-accurate temperature measurements are
often used to monitor the quality of temperature-sensitive med-
ication such as vaccines, or biological substances [24, 45]. They
provide reliable temperature data records to assess the quality of
substances being monitored and can raise an alarm when the stor-
age temperature is out of a predefined range. We investigate our
attacks on a Thomas traceable thermometer and a Fisherbrand
traceable thermometer. Our experiments show that the integrity
of the temperature data recorded by these thermometers can be
compromised by attacks. For instance, with an attack distance of 0.5
m and a transmitting power of 4 W, an adversary can increase the
temperature measurement of the Fisherbrand thermometer from
26◦C to 49◦C or decrease it to 20◦C. Malicious manipulations of
the measurements can result in a recorded temperature data profile
inconsistent with the actual quality of the biologic substances being

ature measurement that can be achieved with different at-
tack distances using a transmitting power of 4 W (left). The

within a range of several tens of MHz. This could be caused by
environmental changes when we change the distance. For instance,
transmitting paths of reflected signals in the experimental area
might have changed; and conductivity of objects nearby might
affect the radiation pattern and impedance of the antenna. We also
measure the relationship between the amount of induced changes
in the measured skin temperature and transmitting power (Fig. 11).
The relationship is consistent with the results of our experiments
on temperature sensor circuitry in Section 4.
Temperature Alarms. During the experiments, the incubator is
functioning in the skin-mode. We notice that when the manipulated
skin temperature measurement significantly deviates from the pre-
set skin temperature, an alarm would be triggered. The incubator
system continuously compares the skin temperature measurement
with the preset temperature value and raise the preset temperature
alarm when a difference larger than 1◦C is detected [13].
Additionally, a high temperature alarm would be triggered if the
air temperature is over 38.5◦C. The alarm system of the incubator
continuously monitors the measurement of an extra internal high
air temperature sensor and raises the high temperature alarm when
the temperature exceeds the maximum temperature limit. The high
temperature limit is 38.5◦C in the Air-Shields C100 incubator [13],
and could be higher in other systems [2]. Finally, there is also a
probe alarm function that detects shorted, open or disconnected
conditions in air, skin, or high temperature sensors. However, the
temperature alarm systems in incubators may not perform safety
precautions reliably if the security of the system is compromised
with physical-level attacks on temperature sensors. As a result,
adversaries can manipulate the infant incubator system to cause
safety issues without triggering any of these alarms.
Heating Attacks. An adversary can decrease the skin temperature
measurement maliciously and trick the internal control loop of the
incubator to actuate the heating system. With an attack distance of 2
m, an adversary that uses a transmitting power of 4 W can decrease
the measured skin temperature by 1.8◦C (Fig. 11). Adversaries can
also launch the attack from an adjacent room. In our experiments,
the infant incubator is placed 0.1 m away from a wall that has a
thickness of 0.15 m and we target the back of the chassis from
an adjacent room. With the wall between the adversary and the
incubator, attacks with the same transmitting power can decrease

monitored, which could lead to the waste of effective substances or
the misuse of ineffective ones that should be discarded. Also, it is
possible for adversaries to manipulate the measured temperature
to suppress the alarm while the actual temperature is out of the
