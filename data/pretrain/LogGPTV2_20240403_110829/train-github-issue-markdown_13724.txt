I was unable to find a duplicate issue related to the `script` module similar
to this issue.
##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
script
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.5.0
##### CONFIGURATION
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS
##### SUMMARY
Script module returns different results for same shell script depending if it
is run locally or if it is run via ssh. Most particularly data printed by the
script on stderr gets reported on stdin when executed over ssh but is
correctly tagged when executed locally.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
A script `foo` containing the following:
    #!/bin/bash
    echo this is stout
    echo this is stderr >&2
is executed via ansible locally as follows:
    ansible localhost -m script -a foo
It generates the output below:
     [WARNING]: provided hosts list is empty, only localhost is available. Note
    that the implicit localhost does not match 'all'
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": true, 
        "rc": 0, 
        "stderr": "this is stderr\n", 
        "stdout": "this is stout\n", 
        "stdout_lines": [
            "this is stout"
        ]
    }
When executed via ssh as follows:
    ansible -i inventory localhost -m script -a foo
it generates the following output:
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": true, 
        "rc": 0, 
        "stderr": "Shared connection to localhost closed.\r\n", 
        "stdout": "this is stout\r\nthis is stderr\r\n", 
        "stdout_lines": [
            "this is stout", 
            "this is stderr"
        ]
    }

##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I expected to see stderr output from the script "foo" to be in the stderr
attribute:
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": true, 
        "rc": 0, 
        "stderr": "this is stderr\n", 
        "stdout": "this is stout\n", 
        "stdout_lines": [
            "this is stout"
        ]
    }
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Remote results did not identify scripts's stderr output.
    localhost | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": true, 
        "rc": 0, 
        "stderr": "Shared connection to localhost closed.\r\n", 
        "stdout": "this is stout\r\nthis is stderr\r\n", 
        "stdout_lines": [
            "this is stout", 
            "this is stderr"
        ]
    }
