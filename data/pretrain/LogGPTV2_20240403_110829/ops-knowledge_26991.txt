User: Please describe the method of using SSH to execute remote commands, and explain its applicable scenarios.
Assistant: The method of using SSH to execute remote commands is as follows: 1. In the local terminal, enter the SSH command to connect to the remote server: ssh username@remote_host Where, username is the username for logging in to the remote server, and remote_host is the host name or IP address of the remote server. 2. Enter the password to log in to the remote server. 3. To execute the command on the remote server, you can directly enter the command in the terminal connected by SSH, for example: ls mkdir test The above command will be executed on the remote server, output the file list and create the test directory. 4. After executing the command, exit the remote server and enter the exit command. This method is suitable for scenarios where some commands need to be executed on a remote server. For example, an administrator needs to install and configure software on a remote server, or check the running status of the server. Using SSH to execute remote commands can save the step of logging in to the remote server, which is convenient and quick. At the same time, SSH executes remote commands to transmit data in an encrypted manner to ensure data security.
