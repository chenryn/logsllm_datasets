User: How to configure an enterprise router for VPN connection between WAN and LAN?
Assistant: Configuring an enterprise-level router to implement a VPN connection between WAN and LAN can be divided into the following steps: 1. Configure WAN interface Configure the WAN interface in the router and set the external IP address, external network gateway, DNS server, etc. 2. Configure VPN service The router needs to support VPN service, and there are usually multiple protocols such as IPSec, PPTP, and L2TP to choose from. Choose a protocol that suits you and configure it in the router. 3. Configure the VPN tunnel Configure the VPN tunnel and set the encryption method, authentication mode and other parameters, and configure the corresponding pre-shared key and certificate at the same time. 4. Configure security policies between WAN and LAN Configure corresponding security policies, such as firewall rules, access control lists, etc., to restrict and control data flow. 5. Configure the VPN client At this point, the router has configured the VPN service and tunnel, and then you need to configure the corresponding VPN connection on the client, specifying the IP address of the VPN service, tunnel name, pre-shared key and other parameters. It should be noted that the VPN connection of enterprise-level routers requires the support of professional knowledge and skills to ensure the security and stability of the connection.
