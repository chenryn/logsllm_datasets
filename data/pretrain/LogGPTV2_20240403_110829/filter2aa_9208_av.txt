\&   %d   a signed integer, in decimal
\&   %u   an unsigned integer, in decimal
\&   %o   an unsigned integer, in octal
\&   %x   an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal
\&   %e   a floating-point number, in scientific notation
\&   %f   a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
\&   %g   a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation
.Ve
.Sp
In addition, Perl permits the following widely-supported conversions:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&   %X   like %x, but using upper-case letters
\&   %E   like %e, but using an upper-case "E"
\&   %G   like %g, but with an upper-case "E" (if applicable)
\&   %b   an unsigned integer, in binary
\&   %p   a pointer (outputs the Perl value's address in hexadecimal)
\&   %n   special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
\&        into the next variable in the parameter list
.Ve
.Sp
Finally, for backward (and we do mean \*(L"backward\*(R") compatibility, Perl
permits these unnecessary but widely-supported conversions:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&   %i   a synonym for %d
\&   %D   a synonym for %ld
\&   %U   a synonym for %lu
\&   %O   a synonym for %lo
\&   %F   a synonym for %f
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the number of exponent digits in the scientific notation produced
by \f(CW%e\fR, \f(CW%E\fR, \f(CW%g\fR and \f(CW%G\fR for numbers with the modulus of the
exponent less than 100 is system\-dependent: it may be three or less
(zero\-padded as necessary).  In other words, 1.23 times ten to the
99th may be either \*(L"1.23e99\*(R" or \*(L"1.23e099\*(R".
.Sp
Between the \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR and the format letter, you may specify a number of
additional attributes controlling the interpretation of the format.
In order, these are:
.RS 8
.IP "format parameter index" 4
.IX Item "format parameter index"
An explicit format parameter index, such as \f(CW\*(C`2$\*(C'\fR. By default sprintf
will format the next unused argument in the list, but this allows you
to take the arguments out of order. Eg:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf '%2$d %1$d', 12, 34;      # prints "34 12"
\&  printf '%3$d %d %1$d', 1, 2, 3;  # prints "3 1 1"
.Ve
.IP "flags" 4
.IX Item "flags"
one or more of:
   space   prefix positive number with a space
   +       prefix positive number with a plus sign
   \-       left-justify within the field
   0       use zeros, not spaces, to right-justify
   #       prefix non-zero octal with \*(L"0\*(R", non-zero hex with \*(L"0x\*(R",
           non-zero binary with \*(L"0b\*(R"
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  printf '', 12;   # prints ""
\&  printf '', 12;   # prints ""
\&  printf '', 12;   # prints ""
\&  printf '', 12;  # prints ""
\&  printf '', 12;  # prints ""
\&  printf '', 12;   # prints ""
.Ve
.IP "vector flag" 4
.IX Item "vector flag"
The vector flag \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR, optionally specifying the join string to use.
This flag tells perl to interpret the supplied string as a vector
of integers, one for each character in the string, separated by
a given string (a dot \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR by default). This can be useful for
displaying ordinal values of characters in arbitrary strings:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  printf "version is v%vd\en", $^V;     # Perl's version
.Ve
.Sp
Put an asterisk \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR before the \f(CW\*(C`v\*(C'\fR to override the string to
use to separate the numbers:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf "address is %*vX\en", ":", $addr;   # IPv6 address
\&  printf "bits are %0*v8b\en", " ", $bits;   # random bitstring
.Ve
.Sp
You can also explicitly specify the argument number to use for
the join string using eg \f(CW\*(C`*2$v\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  printf '%*4$vX %*4$vX %*4$vX', @addr[1..3], ":";   # 3 IPv6 addresses
.Ve
.IP "(minimum) width" 4
.IX Item "(minimum) width"
Arguments are usually formatted to be only as wide as required to
display the given value. You can override the width by putting
a number here, or get the width from the next argument (with \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR)
or from a specified argument (with eg \f(CW\*(C`*2$\*(C'\fR):
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&  printf '', "a";       # prints ""
\&  printf '', "a";      # prints ""
\&  printf '', 6, "a";   # prints ""
\&  printf '', "a", 6; # prints ""
\&  printf '', "long";   # prints "" (does not truncate)
.Ve
.Sp
If a field width obtained through \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR is negative, it has the same
effect as the \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR flag: left\-justification.
.IP "precision, or maximum width" 4
.IX Item "precision, or maximum width"
You can specify a precision (for numeric conversions) or a maximum
width (for string conversions) by specifying a \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR followed by a number.
For floating point formats, with the exception of 'g' and 'G', this specifies
the number of decimal places to show (the default being 6), eg:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  # these examples are subject to system-specific variation
\&  printf '', 1;    # prints ""
\&  printf '', 1;  # prints ""
\&  printf '', 1;  # prints ""
\&  printf '', 10;   # prints ""
\&  printf '', 10; # prints ""
.Ve
.Sp
For 'g' and 'G', this specifies the maximum number of digits to show,
including prior to the decimal point as well as after it, eg:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&  # these examples are subject to system-specific variation
\&  printf '', 1;        # prints ""
\&  printf '', 1;     # prints ""
\&  printf '', 100;      # prints ""
\&  printf '', 100;    # prints ""
\&  printf '', 100.01; # prints ""
\&  printf '', 100.01; # prints ""
\&  printf '', 100.01; # prints ""
.Ve
.Sp
For integer conversions, specifying a precision implies that the
output of the number itself should be zero-padded to this width:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&  printf '', 1;      # prints ""
\&  printf '', 1;     # prints ""
\&  printf '', 1;   # prints ""
.Ve
.Sp
For string conversions, specifying a precision truncates the string
to fit in the specified width:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf '', "truncated";   # prints ""
\&  printf '', "truncated"; # prints ""
.Ve
.Sp
You can also get the precision from the next argument using \f(CW\*(C`.*\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  printf '', 1;       # prints ""
\&  printf '', 6, 1;    # prints ""
.Ve
.Sp
You cannot currently get the precision from a specified number,
but it is intended that this will be possible in the future using
eg \f(CW\*(C`.*2$\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  printf '', 1, 6;   # INVALID, but in future will print ""
.Ve
.IP "size" 4
.IX Item "size"
For numeric conversions, you can specify the size to interpret the
number as using \f(CW\*(C`l\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`h\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`V\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`L\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`ll\*(C'\fR. For integer
conversions (\f(CW\*(C`d u o x X b i D U O\*(C'\fR), numbers are usually assumed to be
whatever the default integer size is on your platform (usually 32 or 64
bits), but you can override this to use instead one of the standard C types,
as supported by the compiler used to build Perl:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&   l           interpret integer as C type "long" or "unsigned long"
\&   h           interpret integer as C type "short" or "unsigned short"
\&   q, L or ll  interpret integer as C type "long long", "unsigned long long".
\&               or "quads" (typically 64-bit integers)
.Ve
.Sp
The last will produce errors if Perl does not understand \*(L"quads\*(R" in your
installation. (This requires that either the platform natively supports quads
or Perl was specifically compiled to support quads.) You can find out
whether your Perl supports quads via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        use Config;
\&        ($Config{use64bitint} eq 'define' || $Config{longsize} >= 8) &&
\&                print "quads\en";
.Ve
.Sp
For floating point conversions (\f(CW\*(C`e f g E F G\*(C'\fR), numbers are usually assumed
to be the default floating point size on your platform (double or long double),
but you can force 'long double' with \f(CW\*(C`q\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`L\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`ll\*(C'\fR if your
platform supports them. You can find out whether your Perl supports long
doubles via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        use Config;
\&        $Config{d_longdbl} eq 'define' && print "long doubles\en";
.Ve
.Sp
You can find out whether Perl considers 'long double' to be the default
floating point size to use on your platform via Config:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        use Config;
\&        ($Config{uselongdouble} eq 'define') &&
\&                print "long doubles by default\en";
.Ve
.Sp
It can also be the case that long doubles and doubles are the same thing:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        use Config;
\&        ($Config{doublesize} == $Config{longdblsize}) &&
\&                print "doubles are long doubles\en";
.Ve
.Sp
The size specifier \f(CW\*(C`V\*(C'\fR has no effect for Perl code, but it is supported
for compatibility with \s-1XS\s0 code; it means 'use the standard size for
a Perl integer (or floating-point number)', which is already the
default for Perl code.
.IP "order of arguments" 4
.IX Item "order of arguments"
Normally, sprintf takes the next unused argument as the value to
format for each format specification. If the format specification
uses \f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR to require additional arguments, these are consumed from
the argument list in the order in which they appear in the format
specification \fIbefore\fR the value to format. Where an argument is
specified using an explicit index, this does not affect the normal
order for the arguments (even when the explicitly specified index
would have been the next argument in any case).
.Sp
So:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  printf '', $a, $b, $c;
.Ve
.Sp
would use \f(CW$a\fR for the width, \f(CW$b\fR for the precision and \f(CW$c\fR
as the value to format, while:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  print '', $a, $b;
.Ve
.Sp
would use \f(CW$a\fR for the width and the precision, and \f(CW$b\fR as the
value to format.
.Sp
Here are some more examples \- beware that when using an explicit
index, the \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR may need to be escaped:
.Sp
.Vb 4
