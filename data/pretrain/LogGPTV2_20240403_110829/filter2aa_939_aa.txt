### Part 1: Layer-7 DoS Vulnerability Analysis and Discovery

#### Research and Findings
- **Test Methodology:**
  - Common Layer-7 DoS techniques:
    - HTTP GET and POST methods
    - HTTP Pipelining
    - Malformed HTTP request
    - Manipulation of TCP and HTTP vulnerabilities

#### Techniques Overview: Pre-Attack
- Identify allowed HTTP methods
- Check if the site accepts POST method even if it only supports GET in web forms
- Identify resource-intensive functions like searching and database retrieval
- Check for large payload responses
- Check for links with large attachments (e.g., .doc, .pdf, media files)
- Verify if HTTP responses are cached
- Check if chunked data in HTTP response packets is allowed

#### Techniques Overview: Attack Techniques
- **Attack Combo #1:**
  - Exploit TCP and HTTP characteristics and vulnerabilities
  - Find URLs that accept POST, change Content Length to 9999 bytes, and check if the connection remains alive

#### Techniques Overview: Post-Attack Techniques
- **Attack Combo #1:**
  - Analyze TCP state timeouts
  - Monitor for FIN/ACK, RST/ACK, and RST initiated by different devices

- **Goals:**
  - Calculate resources to bring down the target
  - Trace detection mechanisms (e.g., Rate Limit)
  - Guess DDoS mitigations
  - Submit incomplete HTTP POST packet attacks

- **Attack Combo #2:**
  - Exploit poor server hardening
  - Simple HTTP requests without proper checks
  - HTTP pipelining
  - Small HTTP requests with multiple PSH/ACK
  - Large data payloads without caching
  - Force new sessions and connections without cache

- **Combined Attack:**
  - Use simple GET, HTTP pipelining, and force no-cache
  - Example:
    ```http
    GET /download/doc.pdf?121234234fgsefasdfl11 HTTP/1.1\r\n
    Host: www.xxxxyyyyzzzz.com\r\n
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n
    ```

- **Test Targets:**
  - United States (39)
  - Europe (20)
  - Asia Pacific (20)

- **Test Summary:**
  - Simple GET accepted: 26/39
  - Simple POST without Content Length: 4/39
  - Method not allowed: 5/39
  - Simple POST with Content Length: 17/39
  - Accept HTTP pipelining: 34/39

- **Summary:**
  - Simple GET should be banned
  - Validate content length
  - Ensure pages do not accept unsupported methods
  - Conduct basic security assessments

- **Further Analysis:**
  - Examples of targets accepting invalid Content Length: Amazon, American Airlines, CNN, Mastercard, McDonald's
  - Deep Analysis: Mastercard.us
  - Defense perspective: Load balancer/proxy handling incomplete HTTP requests

### Part 2: Core Attack Concept and Empowering an Attack Server (with Demos)

- **Demo Setup:**
  - Attack Server: Backtrack 5, 512MB RAM, 2 CPUs (VM)
  - Web Server (Victim): Windows Server 2008 R2, IIS 7.5, 2GB RAM, hardware PC

- **Demos:**
  1. **TCP State CLOSE_WAIT**
     - High CPU usage, unstable server
     - Fix: Harden TCP parameters, set timeouts on security devices
  2. **TCP State FIN_WAIT1**
     - Unavailability of service in a minute
  3. **TCP State ESTABLISHED**
     - Instant unavailability of service

- **Attack Goals:**
  - Demo 1: Cause server instability
  - Demo 2: Cause service unavailability in a minute
  - Demo 3: Cause instant service unavailability

- **Theoretical Background:**
  - Focus on TCP state manipulation
  - Use HTTP to control TCP states
  - Reserve resources for different TCP states
  - Differentiate Layer 7 flood impacts based on TCP states
  - Key: Server's response (e.g., Fin-Ack, RST, RST-Ack, HTTP 200, HTTP 302)

- **Logical Diagram:**
  - Super combo period = TCP state
  - Health = Server resource points
  - Hits = TCP connections
  - Kyo = Attack server
  - Super combo = HTTP request
  - Power = High CPU
  - Andy in fire = Web server

- **Fixes:**
  - Harden server TCP parameters
  - Set timeouts on network security devices
