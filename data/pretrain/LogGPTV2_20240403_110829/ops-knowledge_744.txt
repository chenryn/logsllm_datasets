Assistant: Following are the steps to set up automated testing for a web application: 1. Decide on a testing tool. Choose an automated testing tool suitable for your application, such as Selenium, Katalon Studio, Appium, etc. 2. Write test cases. Write test cases to test the functionality and flow of the application, such as logging in, adding and removing information, submitting forms, etc. 3. Create a test script. Write test scripts using the testing tool of choice, build test scripts on the basis of test cases to simulate user actions and check the reaction of the application. 4. Configure the test environment. Configure the test environment to simulate the real user environment, including loading test data, setting test data and test environment. 5. Run the test script. Run test scripts to test various aspects of the application and check that it performs as expected. 6. Analyze test results. Analyze test results to identify possible problems or errors and ensure that the corresponding problems are fixed. 7. Repeat the test. Continuously repeat testing to ensure application reliability and quality, and make necessary optimizations and improvements. In summary, automated testing can improve the efficiency and quality of web applications, reduce the workload of testing teams, and help ensure application stability and reliability.
