User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题AIX: how to change a password as root without setting the ADMCHG flag? I'd like to change the password of another user, as root, but don't want the user to be prompted to change their password when the log in.  As far as I can tell, any mechanism to change the password as root set the ADMCHG flag in /etc/security/passwd
