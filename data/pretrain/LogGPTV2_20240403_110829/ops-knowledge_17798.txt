**Question:**
How can I change a user's password as the root user on AIX without setting the `ADMCHG` flag? I want to change another user's password, but I do not want the user to be prompted to change their password upon logging in. From what I understand, any method to change a password as root sets the `ADMCHG` flag in `/etc/security/passwd`.

**Answer:**
To change a user's password as the root user without setting the `ADMCHG` flag, you can use the `pwdadm` command with the `-c` option. This will allow you to set the password directly without triggering the `ADMCHG` flag.

Here is the command you can use:
```sh
pwdadm -c username new_password
```

Replace `username` with the target user's name and `new_password` with the new password you wish to set.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the `pwdadm` man page:
```sh
man pwdadm
```

This approach ensures that the user will not be prompted to change their password at the next login.
