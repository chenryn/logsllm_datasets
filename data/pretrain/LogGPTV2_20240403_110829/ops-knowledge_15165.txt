User: Im using python tornado as web server and I have a backend server and a frontend server. I want to create browser-frontend-backend  connection. Can anyone help me how to do this? I know how to create websocket connection between frontend and browser but I have no idea how to connect my frontend server to backend server to stream realtime data parsed by my backend server.
Assistant: WebSocket was designed for low-latency bidirectional browser<->service communication. It's placed on top of TCP/IP and brings along some overhead. It was designed to solve all the problems that you simply do not have when it's about front-end<->back-end communication, because there we're talking about a defined environment which is under your control. Hence, I would recommend going back to the basics and do simple TCP/IP communication between your front-end and back-end.
