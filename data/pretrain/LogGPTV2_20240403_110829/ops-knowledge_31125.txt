User: I need to run a specific manage.py commands on an EC2 instance every X minutes. For example: python manage.py some_command.
I have looked up django-chronograph. Following the instructions, I've added chronograph to my settings.py but on runserver it keeps telling me No module named chronograph.
Is there something I'm missing to get this running? And after running how do I get manage.py commands to run using chronograph?
Edit: It's installed in the EC2 instance's virtualenv.
Assistant: I would suggest you to configure cron to run your command at specific times/intervals.
