### Operations and Observations

The operations revealed a somewhat different scenario. Among the unlabeled drives, as well as those with keys and/or return address labels, a file labeled as the owner’s résumé was found. This would be a logical place to find the owner's contact information. However, as shown in Table II, nearly half of the users first opened one of the winter break photos, which wouldn't reasonably help locate the owner. We suspect that participants who pick up the drive do so with altruistic intentions, but their curiosity often surpasses their altruism.

#### Consent and File Openings
In two cases, consent was recorded, but no files were opened. We suspect that users either opened the HTML files in a text editor or opened the files on a machine without Internet access.

#### Drive Drop Analysis
Significantly fewer drives dropped on Tuesday were opened. However, all drives with return labels were dropped on that day. When these are removed from the dataset, the difference is no longer significant.

### Flash Drive Open Data
Table I shows the number of flash drives whose files were opened, categorized by various factors that could affect the attack's effectiveness. We found that we could not significantly improve our success rate and could only decrease it by including drives with return labels.

| Category | Drives Opened | p-value |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Drive Type | 29/58 (50%) | 0.72 |
| Conﬁdential Exams | 30/60 (50%) | 0.71 |
| Keys | 32/60 (53%) | 0.47 |
| Return Label | 17/59 (29%) | 0.10 |
| None | 27/60 (45%) | - |
| Location Type | 25/58 (43%) | 0.35 |
| Academic Room | 26/60 (43%) | 0.36 |
| Common Room | 24/59 (41%) | 0.23 |
| Hallway | 28/60 (47%) | 0.58 |
| Outside | 32/60 (53%) | - |
| Parking Lot | 49/100 (49%) | 0.26 |
| Location Geography | 46/97 (47%) | 0.36 |
| North | 40/100 (40%) | - |
| South | 71/149 (48%) | 0.52 |
| Main | 64/148 (43%) | - |
| Time of Day | 58/147 (39%) | 0.05 |
| Morning | 41/88 (47%) | 0.57 |
| Afternoon | 77/150 (51%) | - |
| Day of Week | 49/100 (49%) | 0.26 |
| Tuesday | 46/97 (47%) | 0.36 |
| Tuesday (no Return Label) | 40/100 (40%) | - |
| Monday | 71/149 (48%) | 0.52 |

### Lag Time
We measured the time differences between when the flash drive was dropped, when it was found missing, and when a file was opened on the drive. We found that 87.5% of drives were picked up before the next drop round, and all drives were taken by the 8th round of checks. Drives were plugged into a computer with a median lag time of 6.9 hours (average, 38.5 hours). Drives dropped in the afternoon were connected significantly faster (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.017). Despite this, the attack remained effective, and users picked up the drives quickly.

### Browser and Operating System
We found no significant difference between the web browsers used by the users who picked up the drives and the general population statistics published by W3Counter [47] (Table IV). However, we observed a higher proportion of Mac users (p = 0.0022) and a lower proportion of Windows users (p = 0.026), as shown in Table III.

### Comparison to Previous Studies
The file open fraction observed in this study (45%–98%) is less than the open fraction found in three prior anecdotes [6]–[8] (75%, 59%, 68% and p = 0.020, 0.085, 0.005, respectively). It does not significantly differ from Jacobs [18] (37%, p = 0.268), but is significantly greater than CompTIA (17%, p = 9.8 × 10−11). Demographic differences may partially explain this discrepancy.

### Summary
The attack was both effective, with 45%–98% of drives being plugged into participants' computers, and timely, with a median connection time of 6.9 hours. It is unclear whether users are acting purely altruistically: while users are less likely to plug in drives with a return label, they frequently open vacation pictures before the résumé, which would more likely contain contact information. We suspect that users initially act altruistically, but their curiosity eventually eclipses their altruism as they try to find contact information.

### Survey Results
When users opened a file on the flash drive, we offered $10 in compensation for answering a short survey. We received 62 valid responses, which we compared to the 31 valid responses collected through an email survey sent to random members of our university community (our baseline).

#### Motivation
We asked users why they picked up and connected the flash drive and whether the drive's appearance affected their decision. As shown in Table V, the majority of respondents answered that they wanted to return the drive (68%) or expressed curiosity (18%).

| Code | Respondents | Percentage |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Return drive | 42 | 68% |
| Curious | 11 | 18% |
| Listed location as response | 5 | 8% |
| Keep drive | 2 | 3% |
| Given drive by someone else | 2 | 3% |

#### Precautions
We also asked if users took any precautions before opening the file on the flash drive. Most respondents did not take formal protection measures, although some employed a variety of methods (Table VI).

| Code | Respondents | Percentage |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Specific Precautions | 10 | 16% |
| Scanned files with anti-virus | 5 | 8% |
| Mentioned OS security features | 5 | 8% |
| Sacrificed a computer | 4 | 6% |
| Opened a file in a text editor | 3 | 5% |
| Sandboxed a file | 2 | 3% |
| Contacted/Web searched researcher | 2 | 3% |
| No | 42 | 68% |
| Yes | 8 | 13% |

### Conclusion
Our findings indicate that the attack is both effective and timely. While users may initially act out of altruism, their curiosity often takes over. Further exploration of reported motivations and precautions will provide deeper insights into user behavior.
