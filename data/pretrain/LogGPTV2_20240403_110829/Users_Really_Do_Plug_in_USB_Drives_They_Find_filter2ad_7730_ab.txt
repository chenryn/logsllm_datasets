operations paints a slightly different picture. The unlabeled
drives, as well as the drives with keys and/or return address
label contained a ﬁle labeled as the owner’s résumé, which
4In two cases, consent was recorded, but no ﬁles were opened. We suspect
that users opened the HTML ﬁles in a text editor or opened the ﬁles on a
machine without Internet access.
aSigniﬁcantly fewer drives that were dropped on Tuesday were opened, but
all return label drives were dropped on that day and when they are removed
from the data set, the difference is no longer signiﬁcant.

attack’s effectiveness. We are unable to signiﬁcantly improve
our success rate, and can only decrease it by including drives

would be a logical place to ﬁnd the owner’s contact information.
However, as shown in Table II, nearly half of the users
ﬁrst opened one of the winter break photos, which wouldn’t
reasonably help locate the owner. We suspect that participants
who pick up the drive do so with altruistic intentions, but their
curiosity surpasses their altruism.
C. Lag Time
We measured the time differences between when the ﬂash
drive was dropped, when it was found missing, and when a
ﬁle was opened on the drive. We ﬁnd that 87.5% of drives
were picked up before the next drop round and all of the drives
were taken were missing by the 8th round of checks.5
Drives were plugged into a computer in a median 6.9 hours
(average, 38.5 hours), as depicted in Fig. 3.6 The drives that
we dropped in the afternoon were connected signiﬁcantly faster
(two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.017). However,
in both cases, the attack is effective and users pick up the
drives quickly.
5This excludes one drive we found moved, four drives we found unchanged,
one drive that was given a status of “other”, and one drive whose status was
not updated.
6During this analysis, we noticed two inconsistencies. In the ﬁrst, one drive
was connected before it was recorded as being dropped. In the second, the
drive was marked missing signiﬁcantly after a ﬁle had been opened on it. Both
of these were due to recording error and we do not believe they signiﬁcantly
affect our analysis.

Measured lag (hours)
Fig. 3: Empirical CDF of Measured Lag—We show the em-
pirical cumulative distribution function for the time difference
between when a drive was dropped and when a ﬁle was opened
on that drive. Afternoon drives were picked up more quickly
than morning ones, but both were generally picked up quickly.
D. Browser and Operating System
We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant difference between the web browsers
used by the users that picked up drives and the statistics
published by W3Counter [47] for the general population
(Table IV).7 We do however ﬁnd a higher proportion of
Mac (p = 0.0022) and lower proportion of Windows users
(p = 0.026), as shown in Table III.
E. Comparison to Previous Studies
The ﬁle open fraction we observe in this study is less than
the open fraction found in three prior anecdotes [6]–[8] (75%,
59%, 68% and p = 0.020, 0.085, 0.005, respectively). It does
not signiﬁcantly differ from Jacobs [18] (37%, p = 0.268),
but is signiﬁcantly greater than CompTIA (17%, p = 9.8 ×
10−11). We suspect that demographic differences are partially
responsible for this discrepancy.
F. Summary
We ﬁnd the attack is both effective with 45%–98% of drives
plugged into participants’ computers and timely with a median
6.9 hours for a drive to be connected. It is not clear whether
users are acting altruistically: while users are less likely to plug
in drives with a return label, users frequently open vacation
pictures prior to the résumé on the drive, which would more
likely contain contact information. We suspect that users are
initially acting altruistically, but their curiosity eclipses their
altruism as they try to ﬁnd contact information. We further
explore reported motivations in the next section.
V. SURVEY RESULTS
When users opened a ﬁle on the ﬂash drive, we offered $10
in compensation for answering a short survey. We received

each type of USB drive. However, each ﬁle is an HTML with
an embedded image that allows us to track when users open
ﬁles. We ﬁnd that participants displayed evidence consistent
with both altruistic motivations (resume.pdf.html) and
self-interest (winter break pictures).

31 valid responses9 collected through our email survey sent to
random members of our university community (our baseline).
A. Motivation
We asked users why they picked up and connected the ﬂash
drive, as well as whether the drive’s appearance affected their
decision. We analyzed the responses by developing a code book
for each question and having two researchers independently
analyze the responses.10 As shown in Fig. V, the majority
of respondents answered that they wanted to return the drive
(68%) or expressed curiosity (18%).
