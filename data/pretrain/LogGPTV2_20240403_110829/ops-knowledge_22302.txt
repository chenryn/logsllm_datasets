To enable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for remote access on a Windows Server, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to the Windows Server** with an account that has administrative privileges.
2. **Open Server Manager** by right-clicking the Start menu and selecting "Server Manager" or by searching for it in the Start menu.
3. In the left-hand pane of Server Manager, click on **"Remote Desktop Services"** and then select **"Remote Desktop Services Role"**.
4. In the main window, click on **"Add Role Services"**.
5. In the **Role Services Wizard**, check the boxes next to **"Remote Desktop Services"** and **"Remote Desktop Session Host"**. Click **"Next"** and proceed through the wizard until the installation is complete.
6. Return to **"Server Manager"** and navigate back to **"Remote Desktop Services Role"** in the list.
7. In the **Overview** window, click on the **"Remote Desktop Access"** tab.
8. Select the **"Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (recommended)"** option. Then, specify the user groups that should be granted remote access.
9. Click **"Apply"** and then **"OK"** to save your changes.
10. **Restart the server** if prompted, to ensure all settings take effect.

You can now connect to the Windows Server using the Remote Desktop Client from any authorized device.

**Important Security Considerations:**
- Only allow remote access to authorized users.
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
- Regularly update and patch the server to protect against vulnerabilities.

By following these steps and adhering to best security practices, you can securely enable RDP on your Windows Server.
