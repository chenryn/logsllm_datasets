Hello,
I follow the installation steps to use stocks examples which is in
examples/stocks folder.
There, I executed pub get command and it was ok. Then, I tried to launch the
sky_tool like said in the steps by steps instructions.
On examples/stocks folder :
`C:\Users\sylsau\MyDocuments\Android\dart\sky_sdk\examples\stocks>.\packages\sky\sky_tool
start --install '.\packages\sky\sky_tool' n'est pas reconnu en tant que
commande interne ou externe, un programme ex√©cutable ou un fichier de
commandes.`
Sorry, message is in french but problem is that sky_tool is not known as an
executable. Is it normal ? sky_tool is not supported on Windows 8 ?
Thanks for your help.
Sylvain
