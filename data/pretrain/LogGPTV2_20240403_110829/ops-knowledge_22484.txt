User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题VMware VM run on insecure OS I run VMware with Linux through my Windows OS. I want to use the Linux VM for online transactions. Is it possible for a virus, spy or worm to attack my Linux VM from the Windows host? Is my Linux environment the same secure clean Linux installation?

Assistant: Is it possible for a virus/worm to attack on your host to attack the guest OS?  Yes.  Is it likely?  No.

Malware can do anything you can do, including writing to the virtual disk.  The easiest route would be to simply mount the virtual machine drive, and write new malware to it. This is unlikely because it would take specially crafted code to exploit this.  It's unlikely that malware writers would care about this rare corner case.  Malware is about volume, not targeting individuals.  Unless someone is specifically after you, it's not a serious concern.

What is very easy is running a keylogger on the host OS.  A keylogger on the host OS would still be able to log keystrokes on the guest, since all keystrokes still go through the host OS and the guest OS is just another application running on the host.

So a virtual machine can't protect you in any way from keyloggers.
