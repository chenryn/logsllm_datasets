User: I cannot use python in GVIM. When I type:
:python print 1 it just closes GVIM without any message. I triend to run it with -V90logfile but I couldn't find any information about the crash.
GVIM is compiled with python (:version shows +python/dyn +python3/dyn).
GVIM version: 7.3.46 (32 bit with OLE).
Python version: 2.7.3
Initially GVIM couldn't find python27.dll so I edited $MYVIMRC and added:
let $Path = "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Python27;".$Path
Both GVIM and Python have been installed using corporate standards - not manually via installers. Asking here as IT were not able to help me and redirected to external support.
I could reproduce the error on my personal computer, where I copied both GVIM & PYTHON without installing them. Any further suggestions?
Assistant: Finally solved the problem.
It turned out that Python uses PYTHONPATH variable to resolve the PYTHON folder (used to load python libraries and so on). Here is the default value for Python 2.7:
C:\Python27\Lib;C:\Python27\DLLs;C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk
The variable can be set using one of the following:
1. Windows registry
Set the default value of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\2.7\PythonPath key
2. Environment variable
Create environment variable PYTHONPATH and set the value (same as you edit global PATH)
3. _vimrc file
This is the most portable way. Edit your _vimrc (i.e. open vim and enter :e $MYVIMRC command) and set the variable:
let $PYTHONPATH = "C:\\Python27\\Lib;C:\\Python27\\DLLs;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\lib-tk"
