User: I have a requirement to run a local python script which takes arguements and will run on local windows computer from python code hosted on aws.
Assistant: Well, you simply need to find a way for the two of them to communicate without opening huge security holes.  
My suggestion would be a message queue (rabbit MQ, amazon SQS).  The aws application writes jobs to the message queue and a local script runs the worker which is waiting for messages to be written to the queue for it to pick up.
