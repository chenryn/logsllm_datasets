User: Let's say I had a cloud cluster with Python or C or something and I want to execute my function (as a client) in the cloud.  How could I possibly pass the function I wrote locally up to the server?
I've seen this elsewhere and I not only don't know how to do it but I want to see if there are many ideas for it.
Thanks,
Anthony Hurst
Assistant: One of the most popular systems for processing large amounts of data in a cluster is Hadoop (http://hadoop.apache.org/)
You can write functions in python using the MapReduce programming pattern (google it), upload your program to the cluster, and it will process your data.
Take a look and read up. It's a huge topic - too much for one question. If you have some specific use cases please edit your question with more info.
