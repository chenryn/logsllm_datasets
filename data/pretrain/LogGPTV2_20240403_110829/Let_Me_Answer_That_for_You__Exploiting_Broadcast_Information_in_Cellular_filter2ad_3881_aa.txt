**Abstract:**
Mobile telecommunication has become an integral part of our daily lives. However, industry standards such as GSM often overlook scenarios involving active attackers, assuming that all participating devices are trusted and non-malicious. By implementing our own baseband firmware based on OsmocomBB, we challenge this assumption and evaluate the impact of a rogue device on the usage of broadcast information. Our analysis reveals two new attacks based on the paging procedure used in cellular networks. We demonstrate that, for at least GSM, it is feasible to hijack the transmission of mobile-terminated services such as calls, perform targeted denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against individual subscribers, and cause large-scale DoS conditions in metropolitan areas.

## 1. Introduction
Previous research on Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) primarily focused on theoretical aspects [17, 18]. Recently, however, a new research direction has emerged, challenging the fundamental security assumptions of GSM in light of the practical availability of open-source GSM equipment. These assumptions have been made on both sides of the radio link in the cellular network: the Base Station System (BSS), which includes the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station Controller (BSC), and the modem or baseband of a cellular phone. Traditionally, these components have been kept out of reach from malicious activities.

However, the market for used telecommunication equipment, the advent of low-cost software-defined radios, the leakage of hardware specifications, and the contributions of a well-trained open-source community have disrupted this closed environment. This community effort culminated in three open-source projects: OpenBSC, OpenBTS, and OsmocomBB [20, 25, 45]. These projects provide publicly available counterparts to the previously closed radio stacks, although they are currently limited to 2G network handling. Recent research also offers open-source software to tamper with certain 3G base stations [24], opening up new avenues for security investigations in cellular communication [28, 30, 34].

Despite the rollout of 4G networks, GSM remains the dominant cellular standard in many countries. Most new LTE devices are backward-compatible with GSM, ensuring its continued use in areas with pure GSM coverage. Additionally, telecommunications providers are reusing their existing GSM infrastructure for non-voice applications that require slower data communication, such as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Given the pervasive use of GSM, it is crucial to evaluate the security of a standard that is over 20 years old and based on assumptions that may no longer hold true.

This paper continues to challenge the assumption that certain active attacks can be safely excluded from the threat model. We present novel attacks against mobile-terminated services, demonstrating their impact in commercially deployed GSM networks. While the root causes of these vulnerabilities also exist in newer standards like UMTS and LTE, the limitations of current hardware and software make it difficult to test these attacks in those networks. Prior to publishing this research, we responsibly notified the relevant standard organizations through a carrier of our findings.

In summary, our main contributions are:
- **Paging Response Attack:** A novel and practical attack against mobile-terminated services.
- **Implementation and Feasibility:** We show the feasibility and implementation of a mobile phone firmware capable of stealing short messages over-the-air and performing DoS attacks against mobile-terminated services in GSM networks. We evaluated these attacks in major European operator networks.
- **Large-Scale Attack Assessment:** We assess the boundary conditions for a large-scale paging response attack to cause DoS conditions within a large geographical area of a major city.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
- **Section 2:** Provides an overview of the 3GPP GSM network infrastructure, logical channels, and paging protocol procedures.
- **Section 3:** Details our novel attack that exploits the paging procedure in GSM.
- **Section 4:** Describes the characteristics of location areas in a large metropolitan area and the requirements for a large-scale DoS attack.
- **Section 5:** Discusses countermeasures to address the attacks.
- **Section 6:** Provides an overview of related research.
- **Section 7:** Concludes our research.

## 2. Background and Overview
### 2.1 GSM Infrastructure
Despite the complexity of a complete GSM mobile network architecture [3], only a few entities are relevant to this work. The key components are:
- **BTS (Base Transceiver Station):** The access point for a mobile device to the network, relaying radio traffic and providing over-the-air access.
- **MS (Mobile Station):** The mobile device interacting with the network, comprising the necessary hardware and software for mobile communication.
- **MSC (Mobile Switching Center):** A core network entity responsible for routing services, establishing connections, and connecting the cellular network to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
- **VLR (Visitor Location Register):** Maintains location and management data for mobile subscribers in a specific geographical area, acting as a local database cache for subscriber information obtained from the Home Location Register (HLR).

### 2.2 GSM Logical Channels
GSM frequencies are shared among multiple carriers using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). Each BTS serves one or more carrier frequencies identified by the Absolute Radio-Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN). Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) divides physical channels into time slots, forming TDMA frames and multiframes, which are further partitioned into logical channels.

There are two categories of logical channels in GSM:
- **Control Channels:** Used for signaling between the network and the MS. Key control channels include:
  - **BCH (Broadcast Channels):** Provide point-to-multipoint, unidirectional communication from the BTS to mobile stations.
  - **CCCH (Common Control Channels):** Used for signaling between the BTS and MS, including the Paging Channel (PCH) and Random Access Channel (RACH).
  - **DCCH (Dedicated Control Channels):** Carry signaling messages for handover and connection establishment, including the Access Grant Channel (AGCH) and Standalone Dedicated Control Channel (SDCCH).

### 2.3 Mobile-Terminated Service Procedures
GSM distinguishes between Mobile-Originated (MO) and Mobile-Terminated (MT) traffic. To deliver a service to a mobile phone, the MSC must determine the subscriber's location. This involves:
1. **Location Determination:** The core network determines the responsible MSC/VLR and sends a paging message to all BSCs in the subscriber’s location area.
2. **Paging Request:** The BSC sends a paging command message to all base stations within the location area, which transmit the paging request on the PCH.
3. **Identity Comparison:** Each MS compares the Mobile Identity (MI) in the request with its own. If there is a match, the MS acquires radio resources by sending a channel request on the RACH.
4. **Channel Assignment:** The network allocates a dedicated channel and sends an immediate assignment message on the AGCH.
5. **Signaling Link Establishment:** The MS tunes to the dedicated channel and establishes a signaling link, typically over the SDCCH, by sending a paging response message.
6. **Authentication and Service Setup:** The MS and BTS undergo authentication, ciphering, and service setup procedures.

## 3. Attack Description
### 3.1 Theoretical Background
We introduce two threat models:
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** An active attacker aims to disrupt mobile-terminated services within a specific geographical area, preventing calls from reaching the victim.
- **Service Hijacking:** The attacker hijacks the transmission of mobile-terminated services, such as calls and SMS, to gain unauthorized access to the communication.

### 3.2 Experimental Setup and Feasibility
Our experimental setup involves implementing a custom baseband firmware based on OsmocomBB. We demonstrate the feasibility of the attacks by evaluating them in real-world GSM networks. Our results show that 98% of observed paging requests are type 1, which target a single subscriber. Therefore, we focus on type 1 paging requests in our study.

### 3.3 Large-Scale Attack Assessment
To cause DoS conditions in a large geographical area, the attacker must cover multiple location areas. We assess the boundary conditions and resource requirements for such an attack, highlighting the potential impact on a major city.

## 4. Countermeasures
### 4.1 Enhanced Authentication
Implementing enhanced authentication mechanisms can help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and service hijacking.

### 4.2 Network Monitoring and Detection
Deploying advanced network monitoring and detection systems can identify and respond to suspicious activities, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.

## 5. Related Research
Recent studies have explored various aspects of GSM security, including theoretical vulnerabilities and practical attacks. Our work builds on this foundation by providing a detailed analysis of the paging procedure and demonstrating the feasibility of new attacks.

## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, our research highlights the vulnerabilities in the GSM paging procedure and demonstrates the feasibility of novel attacks against mobile-terminated services. By challenging the assumptions underlying GSM security, we aim to improve the overall security of mobile communication networks. Future work will focus on developing and deploying robust countermeasures to protect against these threats.
