Abstract
Mobile telecommunication has become an important part
of our daily lives. Yet, industry standards such as GSM
often exclude scenarios with active attackers. Devices
participating in communication are seen as trusted and
non-malicious. By implementing our own baseband
ﬁrmware based on OsmocomBB, we violate this trust
and are able to evaluate the impact of a rogue device with
regard to the usage of broadcast information. Through
our analysis we show two new attacks based on the pag-
ing procedure used in cellular networks. We demonstrate
that for at least GSM, it is feasible to hijack the trans-
mission of mobile terminated services such as calls, per-
form targeted denial of service attacks against single sub-
scribers and as well against large geographical regions
within a metropolitan area.
1 Introduction
While past research on Global System for Mobile Com-
munications (GSM) mainly focused on theoretical re-
search [17, 18], a very recent research direction chal-
lenged the fundamental GSM security assumptions with
respect to the practical availability of open GSM equip-
ment. The assumptions have been made on both sides of
the radio part of the cellular network. One side of the
radio link is the Base Station System (BSS) consisting of
the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and the Base Station
Controller (BSC), while the other side of the radio part is
the modem or the so-called baseband of a cellular phone.
Traditionally, both radio stacks have been carefully kept
out of reach for any kind of malicious activities.
But a booming market for used telecommunication
equipment, cheap software deﬁned radios, leakage of
some hardware speciﬁcations, and a well-trained open
source community ﬁnally broke up this closed cellular
world. The overall community work culminated in three
open source projects: OpenBSC, OpenBTS, and Osmo-
comBB [20, 25, 45]. These open source projects consti-
tute the long sought and yet publicly available counter-
parts of the previously closed radio stacks. Although all
of them are still constrained to 2G network handling, re-
cent research provides open source software to tamper
with certain 3G base stations [24]. Needless to say that
those projects initiated a whole new class of so far uncon-
sidered and practical security investigations within the
cellular communication research, [28, 30, 34].
Despite the recent roll-out of 4G networks, GSM re-
mains the dominant cellular standard in many countries.
Moreover, as most new LTE devices are backwards com-
patible to GSM, this older standard will not vanish soon
at all, but rather complement 3G and LTE connectivity
in areas with pure GSM coverage. Several other rea-
sons such as worse indoor coverage and the lower num-
ber of deployed UMTS and LTE base stations contribute
to this. Additionally, telecommunication providers have
already begun to reuse their existing GSM infrastructure
within non-voice scenarios which require a much slower
data communication than modern network technologies
are capable of. This is especially the case for Machine
to Machine (M2M) or so-called Internet of Things (IoT)
communications over GSM. Corresponding applications
will soon become parts of our daily life and will make us
more dependent than ever on GSM, cf. [19, 35]. Given
this pervasive GSM usage, it is very important to evalu-
ate the security offered by a standard which is more than
20 years old and is based on assumptions, many of which
no longer hold true.
This paper continues the challenge of the mobile
security assumption that certain active attacks can be
safely excluded from the threat model. Towards this
goal we show novel attacks against mobile terminated
services. While the root cause also exists in newer
standards such as UMTS or LTE, we demonstrate the
impact of it in commercially deployed GSM networks.
To the best of our knowledge, the limitations of currently
available hard- and software would make it very difﬁcult

to test these attacks in UMTS and LTE networks. Prior
to publishing this research, we responsibly notiﬁed the
respective standard organisations via a carrier of our
research results.
In summary, we make the following main contributions:
• We present the paging response attack, a novel and
practical attack against mobile terminated services.
• We show the feasibility and the implementation of
a mobile phone ﬁrmware which is capable to steal a
short message over-the-air and to perform denial of
service attacks against mobile terminated services
in GSM networks. Furthermore, we evaluated these
attacks to be present in major European operator
networks.
• We eventually assess the boundary conditions for a
large-scale paging response attack in order to cause
denial of service conditions within a large geo-
graphical area of a major city.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 provides an overview of the 3GPP GSM net-
work infrastructure, as well as details about logical chan-
nels and paging protocol procedures required to under-
stand our attacks; Section 3 details our novel attack that
exploits the paging procedure as used in GSM; Sec-
tion 4 describes characteristics of location areas in a
large metropolitan area and the respective requirements
to perform a large-scale denial of service attack against
these regions; Section 5 discusses two different counter-
measures to address the attacks; Section 6 provides an
overview of related research; Section 7 concludes our re-
search.
2.1 GSM Infrastructure
Despite the complexity of a complete GSM mobile net-
work architecture [3], only a few entities are relevant to
this work. In the following paragraph, we provide the
necessary background on the infrastructure components
of relevance to this research. Figure 1 illustrates the ar-
chitecture and connections between these components:
• BTS: The Base Transceiver Station is a phone’s ac-
cess point to the network. It relays radio trafﬁc to
and from the mobile network and provides access
to the network over-the-air. A set of BTSs is con-
trolled by a Base Station Controller (BSC) and is
part of a Base Station System (BSS).
• MS: The Mobile Station is the mobile device inter-
acting with the mobile operator network. It com-
prises hardware and software required for mobile
communication (baseband processor, SIM card, and
a GSM stack implementation). The MS interacts
with the BTS over a radio link, also known as the
Um interface. In this paper, the mobile phone of a
victim is often referred to as MS. We will also use
the term MS, user, subscriber, phone, and mobile
device interchangeably.
• MSC: The Mobile Switching Center [6] is a core
network entity responsible for routing services,
such as calls and short messages, through the net-
work. It utilizes components from BSSs to establish
connections to mobile devices, organizes hand-over
procedures and connects the cellular network to the
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
• VLR: The Visitor Location Register maintains loca-
tion and management data for mobile subscribers
roaming in a speciﬁc geographical area handled by
an MSC. It acts as a local database cache for vari-
ous subscriber information obtained from the cen-
tral Home Location Register (HLR), e.g., the mo-
bile identity. A subscriber can only be present in
one VLR at a time. Each of the areas served has
an associated unique identiﬁer, the Location Area
Code (LAC) [3, 8]. As soon as a phone leaves a cer-
tain geographical area called Location Area (LA), it
has to perform the Location Update procedure [4]
to notify the network of this event.
2 Background and Overview
This section brieﬂy describes the GSM cellular network
infrastructure. We continue to explain the important
types and functions of logical channels. Furthermore,
we depict the protocol details required to understand the
basis of our attack.
2.2 GSM Logical Channels
The available GSM frequencies are shared among a num-
ber of mobile carriers. Each of the GSM frequency bands
is divided into multiple carrier frequencies by means of
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA). A BTS

serves at least one associated carrier frequencies identi-
ﬁed by the Absolute Radio-Frequency Channel Number
(ARFCN). The ARFCN provides a dedicated pair of up-
link and downlink frequencies for receiving and trans-
mitting data over the Um interface [10]. Because the ra-
dio frequency is shared among a number of subscribers,
GSM uses Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) as
channel access method and divides physical channels
provided by the ARFCN into 8 time slots. A sequence of
8 consecutive time slots is called a TDMA frame. Mul-
tiple TDMA frames form a multiframe. It consists either
of 51 or 21 TDMA frames (respectively control frames
or trafﬁc frames). Multiframes are further partitioned to
provide logical channels.
The two categories of logical channels in GSM are
control channels and trafﬁc channels [5]. Control chan-
nels provide means for signaling between the network
and the MS. Because our attack is solely based on signal-
ing, we focus on the details of control channels. There
are three categories of control channels:
• BCH: Broadcast Channels provide a point-to-
multipoint, unidirectional channel from the BTS to
mobile stations (transmitted on the downlink fre-
quency). Among other functionalities,
they act
as beacon channels and include logical channels
for frequency correction (FCCH), synchronization
(SCH), and information about the cell conﬁguration
and identity (BCCH) [5, 7].
• CCCH: Common Control Channels are used for
signaling between the BTS and MS, both on the up-
link and downlink. They are used by the MS to re-
quest radio resources and to access the mobile net-
work.
• DCCH: Dedicated Control Channels carry signal-
ing messages related to handover procedures or con-
nection establishment, e.g., during call setups.
For our attack, we are mainly interested in logical chan-
nels that are part of the CCCH and DCCH categories.
These categories consist of several logical channels. The
logical channels of interest are as follows:
• PCH: The Paging Channel is used by the BTS to in-
form an MS about an incoming service (via paging
request messages on the downlink channel). The
PCH, which is part of the CCCH, will be monitored
by any MS in idle mode unless it is currently using
a dedicated channel.
• RACH: The Random Access Channel provides a
shared uplink channel utilized by the MS to request
a dedicated channel from the BTS. Placing a phone
call or receiving an incoming service always re-
quires a phone to setup a dedicated signaling chan-
nel beforehand.
• AGCH: The Access Grant Channel provides a
downlink channel used by the BTS to transmit as-
signment messages that notify mobile stations of
assigned channel details. A successful channel re-
quest on the RACH will result in an Immediate As-
signment message on the AGCH. These assignment
messages contain the required conﬁguration param-
eters that enable the MS to tune to the requested
channel.
• SDCCH: The Standalone Dedicated Control Chan-
nel is used on both uplink and downlink. It is em-
ployed for call setup and signaling between BTS
and MS. Furthermore, it can be utilized to transmit
short messages to the MS.
It is important to note that both the BCH and CCCH
channel types are point-to-multipoint channels. This im-
plies that information on the logical downlink channels is
broadcasted to all subscribers served by a speciﬁc BTS.
Throughout this work we will see how this can be abused
to model new attacks.
2.3 Mobile Terminated Service Procedures
The GSM speciﬁcations differ between trafﬁc originat-
ing or terminating at a mobile phone. This is referred
to as Mobile Originated (MO) and Mobile Terminated
(MT) trafﬁc. As outlined previously, we aim to attack
MT services, such as phone calls or SMS. Thus, in the
following we concentrate on the underlying protocol pro-
cedures associated with MT services [4].
In order to deliver a service to a phone, the MSC
needs to determine the location of the respective sub-
scriber. This has to be done for two reasons. First, mo-
bile phones will be idle most of the time to save battery
power and so will not be in constant contact with the net-
work. Thus, the operator does not always know the spe-
ciﬁc BTS that provides the best reception level to the MS.
Therefore, it must broadcast this signal of an incoming
service through at least the entire location area. Second,
broadcasting this information through the whole opera-
tor network would impose a huge performance overhead
and possibly overload the paging channel [42].
In a ﬁrst step,
the core network determines the
responsible MSC/VLR for the target subscriber with the
help of the HLR. Next, the MSC obtains the location
information for the destination subscriber from the
VLR and sends a paging message to all BSCs in the
subscriber’s location area. This message includes a
list of cell identiﬁers/base stations serving the speciﬁc

mobile identity of the subscriber, which is usually either
a International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or
a Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (TMSI). We
illustrate the remaining protocol logic using a successful
MT phone call as depicted in Figure 2.
1. The BSC sends a paging command message which
includes the subscriber identity to all base stations
within the location area. All base stations re-
encapsulate the mobile identity and transmit it as
part of a paging request message on the downlink
PCH.
2. When receiving a paging request on the PCH, each
MS compares the Mobile Identity (MI) included in
the request with its own. The result determines
whether the message is addressed to itself or a dif-
ferent subscriber.
3. In case of an identity match, the MS needs to ac-
quire access to Radio Resources (RR) in order to
receive the MT service. To do so, it sends a channel
request including a random reference number on the
uplink RACH.
4. Upon receipt of the channel request, the network
allocates radio resources and a dedicated channel.
Next, it acknowledges the request and sends details
of the allocated channel to the MS in an immediate
assignment message on the AGCH downlink. To al-
low the MS to identify its assignment, the message
contains the random reference of the requester.
5. The AGCH is a shared downlink channel. There-
fore, an MS receiving an assignment message com-
pares the included reference with the one sent in the
request. If the reference matches, the MS tunes to
the dedicated signaling channel included in the as-
signment.
6. After this step succeeded, the Mobile Station estab-
lishes a signaling link, usually over the SDCCH, by
sending a GSM Layer 2 SABM frame containing a
Layer 3 paging response message.
7. Following this, the MS and BTS undergo an authen-
tication, ciphering and service setup procedure. De-
tails of this procedure are not relevant for our attack.
We skip these details here.
The GSM standard speciﬁes [4] three types of paging
requests – type 1, 2, and 3. The type stipulates the num-
ber of subscribers that can be addressed with the pag-
ing request. Type 1 can page one or two subscribers,

type 2 two or three subscribers, and type 3 paging re-
quests are directed towards four subscribers at once. A
recent study [30] suggests that in real operator networks
the vast majority of paging requests is of type 1. During
our experiments, we veriﬁed that 98% of all paging re-
quests that we observed are type 1 requests. Therefore,
we ignore type 2 and type 3 paging requests in our study.
3 Attack Description
In this section, we will provide the theoretical back-
ground of our attack, introduce our experimental setup
and elaborate on the feasibility of such an attack.
3.1 The Two Threat Models
Denial of Service Attacks. The ﬁrst threat comprises
an active attacker, interested in signiﬁcantly disturbing
mobile terminated services within a speciﬁc geograph-
ical area, e.g., a district or a part of a city.
In certain
situations it
is desirable to ensure that a person or
a device is not reachable via mobile telephony. For
example a third-party may want to prevent a speciﬁc call
from reaching the victim. The effect would be similar
to the ability of selectively jamming incoming services
for a set of subscribers. This includes individuals and
groups of individuals. Such an attack would also have
