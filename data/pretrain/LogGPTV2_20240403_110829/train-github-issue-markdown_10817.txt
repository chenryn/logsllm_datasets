Hello,

I'm encountering an issue with the visibility of methods generated by my macro. Here is the source code of the macro:

```rust
// [Insert your macro source code here]
```

When I try to use the macro with the `pub` keyword, like this:
```rust
pub impl_GObjectFunctions!(t1, t2);
```

The generated methods are not public. Am I doing something incorrectly, or is this a compiler bug?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
