logical_and : Compute the truth value of x1 AND x2 element-wise.  
logical_or : Compute the truth value of x1 OR x2 `element-wise.
So far, good, however, both show this in the Returns section
y : ndarray or bool  
Boolean result of the logical OR operation applied to the elements of x1 and
x2; the shape is determined by broadcasting. This is a scalar if both x1 and
x2 are scalars.
I am thinking that AND should be with logical_and and OR should be with
logical_or
