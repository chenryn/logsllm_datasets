Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

---

### `logical_and`:
Computes the element-wise logical AND operation between `x1` and `x2`.

### `logical_or`:
Computes the element-wise logical OR operation between `x1` and `x2`.

### Returns:
- **y**: `ndarray` or `bool`
  - The boolean result of the logical operation (AND for `logical_and`, OR for `logical_or`) applied to the elements of `x1` and `x2`.
  - The shape of the output is determined by broadcasting. If both `x1` and `x2` are scalars, the result is a scalar.

### Example Usage:
```python
import numpy as np
import sys

# Check the versions
print(np.__version__)  # '1.17.2'
print(sys.version)     # '3.6.9 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Jul 30 2019, 14:00:49) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)]'
```

This version clearly distinguishes between the two functions, provides a clear and concise description of the return value, and includes an example of how to check the versions of `numpy` and `sys`.
