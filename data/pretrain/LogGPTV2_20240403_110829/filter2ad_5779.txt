Humble Beginnings, Uncertain End: 
Getting the Internet to Provide Performance Guarantees

Keynote Talk 
Abstract 
One of the pioneering efforts to obtain guaranteed performance from the Internet was born out of sheer 
curiosity.  The  question  “Can  it  be  done,  and,  if  so,  how?”  came  unexpectedly  to  the  mind  of  a 
researcher  who  had  never  been  active  in  the  field  of  networking,  and  kept  tormenting  him  until  it 
became  a  personal  challenge.  Also  due  to  many  other  researchers  (with  a  lot  more  networking 
credentials),  the  topic  was  for  several  years  quite  a  popular  one  in  the  community,  and  various 
protocols were designed, some even implemented, to incarnate some of the results of research. Will 
any of those protocols ever be deployed on the Internet?  Only the future will tell. 
Bio 
Domenico Ferrari earned a Dr. Ing. degree in Electronics Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, 
Italy, in 1963. He became an Assistant Professor at the Politecnico in 1967. In 1970, he joined the 
faculty of the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California, 
Berkeley, where he is now Professor Emeritus of Computer Science. From 1983 to 1987, he served as 
Chairman of the Computer Science Division and Associate Chairman of the Department. Starting in 
1983, he was also the faculty sponsor of Berkeley's BSD Unix Project. 
Domenico  was  one  of  the  founders  and,  from  its  inception  in  April  1988  until  June  1990,  Deputy 
Director, as well as until 1995 Vice President, of the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) in 
Berkeley. During the 1988-95 period, he also led ICSI's Networks Group. 
Since October 1995, he is the Director of the Center for Research on the Applications of Telematics to 
Organizations and Society (CRATOS) at the Università Cattolica, Piacenza, Italy, where, in December 
2000, he was appointed for “chiara fama” (outstanding reputation) to the Chair of General Informatics 
in the College of Economics.  
Over  the  years  of  his  career,  Domenico’s  research  has  been  concerned  with  switching  theory,  fast 
computer arithmetic, computer-aided design, performance  analysis of computer systems, distributed 
systems, and networking. In 1989, he founded the Tenet Group, a group of top-notch graduate students 
and post-docs, which designed and built two real-time protocol suites, and experimented with them on 
several networking testbeds.  
Now, he is coordinating a large regional project in the field of ICT applications to logistics, and is 
involved in efforts regarding the establishment of e-government and e-democracy in Italy. He is also 
deeply engaged in the struggle to preserve the natural, historical and artistic heritage of his country of 
origin, and especially of his hometwon, Piacenza. 
He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Fellow of the ACM, and received the 1987 A. A. Michelson Award of 
the Computer Measurement Group.
