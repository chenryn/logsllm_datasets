User: AppEngine 1.7.6 has promoted Django 1.4.2 to GA.
I wonder how and if people this are using The reason for my question is that Django-nonrel seems to be stuck on Django 1.3 and there are no signs of an updated realease.
What I would like to use from Djano are controllers, views and especially form validations.
Assistant: The django library built into GAE is straight up normal django that has an SQL ORM.  So you can use this with Cloud SQL but not the HRD.
django-nonrel is up to 1.4.5 according to the messages on the newsgroup.  The documentation, unfortunately, is sorely behind.
