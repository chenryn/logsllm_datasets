User: I have Apache running on OSX Lion and MacPorts Python and some packages installed with MacPorts. 
There are some Python cgi scripts that I'd like to run. It looks like Apache uses the Python that is installed with Lion. How can I configure Apache so that the cgi scripts are run with the MacPorts Python and sites-packages (PYTHONPATH I guess)?
Assistant: Edit the shebang line in the CGI scripts to point to the other executable.
