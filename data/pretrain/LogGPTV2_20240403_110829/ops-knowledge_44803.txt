User: I am using the Python IDE Wing and just cannot seem to find the auto-complete option. Is there even such option in this program?
Assistant: You are probably using Wing 101, which is a very scaled back version that does not have auto-completion.  It was designed for teaching beginning programmers and the professors we worked with in creating it felt auto-completion should be left off.
Wing IDE Personal and Wing IDE Pro both have auto-completion and much more; Wing 101 really is severely scaled back to make it simple for beginners.
