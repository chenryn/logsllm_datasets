Hi, I am the maintainer of the multi_image_picker plugin. A developer has
reported an issue, where when you return from an Activity, a TextField no
longer can open the keyboard if you focus the text field.
When you invoke the image picker, then the user is taken to an image selection
(another activity is spawned) and after he returns back to the flutter app
after selecting the images, focusing the text field no longer brings the
keyboard up.
The developer also discovered that invoking
    FocusScope.of(context).requestFocus(new FocusNode());
just before invoking the Activity to pick the images, solves the problem. So I
guess the Flutter app does not correctly regain focus after returning from the
other Activity.
## Steps to Reproduce
The POC can be observed in the original issue here
