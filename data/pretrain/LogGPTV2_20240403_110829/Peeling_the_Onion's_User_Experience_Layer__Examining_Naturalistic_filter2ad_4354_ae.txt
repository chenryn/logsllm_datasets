B INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
Please keep in mind that there are no incorrect answers to
these questions. Any answers you provide will remain strictly
confidential with access limited only to the research team
unless otherwise required by law. Additionally, you may refuse
to answer any question. All questions are optional.
This interview will be recorded to aid in the analysis per-
formed by the researchers. After the interview is transcribed,
the audio data will be deleted. Anonymous transcribed data
will be retained indefinitely. If you wish, you can request that
the recording device be disabled at any time.
Do you consent to the audio recording of this interview?
Do you consent to the indefinite retention of the anonymous
transcribed interview data?
(1) Please describe your experience using the Tor Browser.
(2) Please tell us about some of the issues you encountered
using the Tor Browser as your default browser.
(a) Could you elaborate on the issue?
(b) Did you encounter this issue more times than you
reported it in the online questionnaires?
(c) On which categories of Web sites did this issue occur?
(d) Would this issue hinder you from using the Tor
Browser in the future?
(3) Will you continue using the Tor Browser after this
study? Why or why not?
(4) In your opinion, which of the issues you encountered
while using the Tor Browser caused the most confusion
and/or frustration?
(5) One issue many Tor Browser users face is long wait-
ing times (high latency). However, this latency can be
an artifact of how Tor protects your identity. Indeed,
in some instances latency and anonymity are trans-
actional: higher latency can lead to better protection.
Knowing this, are there certain tasks for which you
would be willing to tolerate latency to gain anonymity?
(6) Are there any other issues that you encountered while
using the Tor Browser that you wish to report?
(7) Is there anything else I should have asked?
C WRITE-UP PROMPT
Write an essay of about 2-3 single-spaced pages about your
experience of using the Tor Browser as your default and
primary browser for the duration of one week. Your essay
should describe your positive and negative experiences with
the user interface and user experience of the Tor Browser.
Please provide specific examples along with respective rele-
vant contextual details. Please include a discussion of what
you learned specifically about the Tor Browser and Tor as well
as generally about Web technology, anonymity, surveillance,
etc. Feel free to propose creative solutions or improvements
that could have helped you utilize the Tor Browser more
effectively. Please also indicate whether your browsing be-
havior during the study period was typical of your browsing
behavior at other times. If your browsing practices during
the study period differed from your typical practices, please
explain how and why. You may also comment on your study
participation experience, such as the questionnaires prompted
by the script throughout the week.
