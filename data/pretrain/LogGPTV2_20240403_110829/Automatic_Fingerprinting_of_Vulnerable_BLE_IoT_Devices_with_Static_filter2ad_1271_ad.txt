which are identified as BLE devices. The rest of them are likely
Bluetooth classic. Surprisingly, among the 5, 822 BLE devices, 5, 509
(94.6%) can be fingerprinted with UUIDs, which means that our
fingerprinting approach is quite effective to identify real IoT de-
vices. To have a high level understanding of the popular IoT device
manufactures, we extract those standard UUIDs and search their
company name from the Bluetooth SIG [3]. Table 9 shows the com-
pany distribution of the UUIDs from our field test. According to
the table, Google’s IoT devices are the most prevalent ones in our
scanned region (which contains a number of apartment complex),
far more popular than those from Tile, Logitech, Nest Labs, etc.
Device fingerprinting result. With these 5, 509 fingerprintable
devices, we further looked into top 10 specific fingerprinted devices.
This result is presented in Table 10, along with the company name of
the standard UUIDs from the Bluetooth SIG, and the fingerprinted
apps as well as the number of their installation.
According to Table 10, 6 UUIDs are perfectly mapped to only one
app, while the remaining 5 UUIDs are mapped to multiple apps. We
