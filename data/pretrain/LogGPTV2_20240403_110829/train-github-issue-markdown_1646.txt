During package updates the "Updating" status of many (not all) packages
doesn't seem to change to "Updated" even after the updates have been
successfully installed. I can see the updates were successfully installed by
clicking "Check for Updates" again after which the "Updating" message
disappears and I get the message "All of your installed packages are up to
date!".
The issue only appeared after the 1.0.0 release and mostly with some of the
larger packages. I realise that larger packages take longer to install but
I've tested by waiting more than 10 min and then checking for updates again.
This is not a major issue â€“ in the past I usually waited for conformation that
all packages were installed before I continued working where now I have to
allow enough time to ensure the process has successfully run.

Thx!  
(PS. I've tried pretty much all available editors and Atom is by far the
best.)
