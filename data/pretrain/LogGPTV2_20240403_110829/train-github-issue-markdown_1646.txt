Subject: Issue with Package Update Status in Atom 1.0.0

Dear Support Team,

I am writing to report an issue I have encountered with the package update status in Atom, which has only appeared after the 1.0.0 release.

**Issue Description:**
During the package update process, the "Updating" status for many (but not all) packages does not change to "Updated," even though the updates have been successfully installed. To confirm that the updates were indeed installed, I clicked on "Check for Updates" again. At this point, the "Updating" message disappeared, and I received a confirmation that "All of your installed packages are up to date!"

This issue seems to primarily affect some of the larger packages. While I understand that larger packages take longer to install, I have tested by waiting more than 10 minutes before checking for updates again, and the problem persists.

**Impact:**
In the past, I would wait for confirmation that all packages were installed before continuing my work. Now, I have to allow additional time to ensure the update process has completed successfully. Although this is not a major issue, it does affect my workflow.

**System Specifications:**
- MacBook Pro 17" (2011)
- Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10.4)
- Atom Version 1.0.0

**Additional Note:**
I have tried various editors, and Atom is by far the best. Thank you for your continued support and for developing such a great tool.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
