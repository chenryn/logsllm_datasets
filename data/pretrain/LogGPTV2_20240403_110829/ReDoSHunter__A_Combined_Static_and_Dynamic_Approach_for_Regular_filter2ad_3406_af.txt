### Summary of ReDoSHunter's Performance in Identifying ReDoS Vulnerabilities

**Comparison with Existing Methods:**
- Among all methods, only ReDoSHunter (RHR) can identify all 35 known ReDoS vulnerabilities. The best existing method, SAX, can only identify approximately half of them (21 out of 35, or 60.00%).
- The identification rates of other methods range from 14.3% (5 out of 35) to 34.4% (12 out of 35).
- Notably, there are 7 unique CVEs (CVE #12, #18, #19, #22, #28, #29, and #35) that can only be identified by ReDoSHunter, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the effectiveness of ReDoSHunter.

**Pattern Analysis:**
- To gain further insights, we analyzed the presence of patterns in all 35 ReDoS-related CVEs, as shown in Figure 9. Each CVE involves at least one pattern, indicating the effectiveness of our five patterns and the high recall rate of ReDoSHunter.

**Case Study: CVE-2015-8854 (Figure 10):**
- ReDoSHunter successfully detected two vulnerabilities in the regex, generating attack strings ('_' + '__' × 100 + '!' and '*' + '**' × 100 + '!') and diagnosing the corresponding EOD patterns ((?:__|[\s\S])+ and (?:\*\*|[\s\S])+).
- In comparison, all seven other detectors failed to detect any vulnerability. Additionally, the vulnerability discloser and project maintainers only found and fixed one vulnerability, respectively.
- This case study demonstrates ReDoSHunter's capability to find real-world vulnerabilities that other methods miss.

**Summary for RQ2:**
- ReDoSHunter can identify all 35 ReDoS-related CVEs, while the best existing method identifies only over 60.00%.
- There are 20.00% of CVEs (7 out of 35) that can only be identified by ReDoSHunter, indicating the effectiveness of our concluded patterns.
- Therefore, ReDoSHunter significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods in finding real-world known ReDoS vulnerabilities.

### Evaluation on Unknown ReDoS Vulnerabilities

**Methodology:**
- We applied ReDoSHunter to 26 popular projects on GitHub, npm, and PyPI to identify potential ReDoS-vulnerable regexes.
- Upon detection, we reported the findings to the maintainers and submitted them to CVE for confirmation.
- We collaborated with Snyk, a security research team, to verify the reproducibility and severity of the vulnerabilities, contact the maintainers, and assign CVE IDs once confirmed.

**Results:**
- ReDoSHunter detected 28 ReDoS-vulnerable regexes in these 26 projects, with 26 assigned CVE IDs and 2 fixed by the maintainers.
- Other methods were also applied, but their results were unsatisfactory, detecting at most 35.71% of the vulnerabilities (an average of 25.51%), leaving about 64% of the vulnerabilities unrevealed.
- These results align with previous findings in §4.2 and §4.3, demonstrating ReDoSHunter's effectiveness in uncovering previously unknown vulnerabilities.

**Summary for RQ3:**
- ReDoSHunter is capable of exploring unknown ReDoS vulnerabilities in the wild. Among the 28 identified vulnerabilities, 26 were assigned CVE IDs, and 2 were fixed by the maintainers.
- This highlights ReDoSHunter's ability to discover and report new, previously unknown ReDoS vulnerabilities, making it a valuable tool for enhancing software security.
