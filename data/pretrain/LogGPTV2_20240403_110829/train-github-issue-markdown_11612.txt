In other IDEs I used to simple copy a line break and paste it to the find text
box. Then I could replace it with some other string.
I tried to do it with regex find using "\n" or "\r" and I had no luck either.
This is very helpful when creating db queries or csv files on the fly by
replacing line breaks with strings like: '");' or whenever you detect some
char (like >) you can replace it with a breakline.
Thanks a lot!
