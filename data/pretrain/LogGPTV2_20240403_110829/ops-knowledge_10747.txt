Question: "Consider a secure system that employs HMAC for message authentication. Given the security properties of HMAC and its construction, select all statements that are true:"
 "A": "HMAC can only be used with hash functions that produce a fixed output size of 256 bits."
 "B": "If a single bit in the message or key is altered, the output tag of HMAC will be unpredictable and substantially different."
 "C": "HMAC requires two unrelated keys for its operation, which must be provided separately and remain distinct throughout its usage."
 "D": "HMAC is efficient because its inner hash function call only hashes the message plus a constant number of additional bits."
