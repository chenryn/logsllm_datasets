Part of what made node.js take off so much wasn't the http server, but rather,
the runtime's ability to allow developers to use JS to write a server, mobile
app, and even hardware.
In that same spirit, wouldn't it be advantageous to add direct support for
serial, usb, ble, etc?
Also if the goal is to make it more "web like" or webby, adding support for
modern web API's like #5954 mentions could be really help this.
There are also other API's beyond Serial API and the Native File System API,
that could definitely help bring native-like app and hardware development to
deno such as:
Browser Debugging:
  * Dev Tool Protocol
  * Would adding out of the box support for this drastically aid debugging between the server and client communication?
  * What about browserfy-like opening, refreshing, or even cross-browser visual testing?
  * Chrome, chromium-edge and firefox all use it (if I'm not mistaken).
Native / Mobile App API's
  * I2C
  * USB
  * web serial
  * sensor APIs
  * Web Bluetooth API 
  * Geolocation
Light weight Database Stuff also addresses #5605
  * IndexDB
  * WebSQL
