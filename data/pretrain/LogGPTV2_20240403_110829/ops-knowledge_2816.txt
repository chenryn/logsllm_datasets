User: Please refer to the following Nginx configuration to explain the function of its related parameters and give optimization suggestions worker_processes 1;\nevents {\n worker_connections 1024;\n}\nhttp {\n include mime.types;\n default_type application/octet-stream; \n sendfile on;\n #keepalive_timeout 0;\n keepalive_timeout 65;\n \n server {\n listen 80;\n server_name localhost;\n \n location / {\n root html;\n index index.html index.htm;\n }\n \n error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html;\n location = /50x.html {\n root html;\n }\n }\n}\nAssistant: worker_processes 1; # Set the number of worker processes to 1 events { worker_connections 1024; # Each worker process can handle up to 1024 connections} http { include mime.types; # Contains mime type configuration files default_type application/octet-stream; # unknown type File type sendfile on; # open sendfile #keepalive_timeout 0; # close keep-alive keepalive_timeout 65; # keep-alive timeout is 65 seconds server { listen 80; # listening port is 80 server_name localhost; # domain name location / { root html; #Static resource root directory index index.html index.htm; #Static page displayed by default} error_page 500 502 503 504 /50x.html; #Server error jump page location = /50x.html { root html; } } } Optimization Suggestions: 1. It is recommended to set the number of worker processes as a multiple of the number of CPU cores to fully utilize the multi-core feature of the CPU. 2. It is recommended to adjust the keep-alive_timeout to within 15 - 30 seconds to reduce resource consumption. 3. It is recommended to increase worker_connections to the maximum number of connections to increase concurrency. 4. It is recommended to enable gzip compression to compress static files to reduce file size and improve access speed. 5. It is recommended to use CDN services to speed up access to static resources and reduce server pressure.
