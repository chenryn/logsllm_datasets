User: I wrote a python script but accidentally put an infinite while loop in my script.
How do I kill the process? I've tried ctrl+c but with no success. 
Are there any other option to try? 
I'm on Mac Os X 10.7.2 with python 2.7
Assistant: Open Activity monitor, go to the Processes tab, and highlight python.exe and quit it by clicking Quit.
