As mentioned, there is an issue with determining which tests belong to which file or module. Currently, the `std` library addresses this by prefixing every test name. While this approach works, a more effective solution could be implemented. Specifically, `deno test` should log the file paths to differentiate the tests, providing a clearer overview. For example:

```
std/datetime/test.ts
  - test parse ... ok
  - test format ... ok
  ...

std/bytes/test.ts
  - test findIndex1 ... ok
  - test findIndex2 ... ok
  ...
```

This format would make it easier to identify which tests are associated with which files, thereby improving the overall organization and readability of the test results.
