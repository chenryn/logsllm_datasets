As mentioned here:  
There is a problem what tests belong to which file/module. `std` solves that
currently with prefixing every test name. Though that works, I think there
would be a better solution. `deno test` should log file paths to differentiate
the tests like so for a better overview:
    std/datetime/test.ts
      test parse ... ok
      test format ... ok
      …
    std/bytes/test.ts
      test findIndex1 ... ok
      test findIndex2 ... ok
      …
