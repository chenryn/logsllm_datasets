tion can be used to locate the attacker.
10. CONCLUSION
In this work, we thoroughly investigated a multi-receiver-
based GPS spooﬁng detection technique and performed its
ﬁrst practical implementation. We started by revising the
underlying assumptions of previous theoretical work, in par-
ticular the error models, and proposed that there is a cor-
relation between errors at co-located receiver positions. We
experimentally validated that the predicted error correlation
is present in authentic signal scenarios, as well as under a
spooﬁng attack. By leveraging the correlated noise of co-
located receivers, we were able to lower the false acceptance
rate of the countermeasure, while preserving the sensitivity
to attacks.
As result, a formation covering an area of 26 m2 is suf-
ﬁcient (for a detection rate of 99 % and a false detection
rate of approx. 10−5), in contrast to the previously proposed
200 m2 [27] or even larger area in [5]. We realized the ﬁrst
multi-receiver-based GPS spooﬁng detection system based
on low-cost COTS devices. Using that implementation, we
were able to validate our theoretical ﬁndings through a range
of experiments using single-antenna and multi-antenna at-
tackers. For an experiment over the course of roughly 3 h,
we observed no false positive or false negatives.
For future work, promising avenues based on our exper-
imental measurements include further reductions of the re-
quired distance between receivers (e. g., in scenarios with
rather stable signals due to direct line-of-sight) or due to re-
ceiver dynamics. Additionally, the detection threshold could
be subject to dynamic adaptation.

APPENDIX
A. SELECTION OF FUNCTION F
We consider four diﬀerent functions, which represent a
minimal, maximal, majority, and normalized approach. The
minimal and the maximal functions only consider the mini-
mal, respectively the maximal, measured distance from the
set of all distances. The majority approach performs a type
of voting mechanism which decides for spooﬁng when the
majority of distances, i. e., four out of six, fall below the
decision threshold. The normalized approach makes some
distances more signiﬁcant than others, e. g., the diagonal in
a square is √2 times longer than the edges and then per-
forms a majority voting.
For m = 4 receivers there are six distances in total. We
evaluate the detection performance of diﬀerent instantia-
tions of the function f , which operate on the distances. Ex-
emplary, we present results considering the error model with
the same error distributions for spooﬁng and non-spooﬁng
conditions (Case 3). We are able to identify the best choice

for the function f for this speciﬁc model and give hints to-
wards the impact of changing error models.
Figure 13 compares performance values for the chosen
types of the function f , i. e., minimal, maximal, majority,
and normalized. As one can see, the choice of a minimal
function oﬀers the worst performance from the analyzed set.
The other three types, namely maximal, majority, and nor-
malized, all perform pretty similar.
In order to quantitatively compare the performances, we
compute the relative diﬀerence in EER over all radii and
average it by means of normalizing the results. Results are
given in Table 6. We can state that the normalized approach
performs approx. 2 % better than the (non-normalized) ma-
jority voting and approx. 17 % better than the maximal func-
tion. The majority function has an approx. 15 % better aver-
age performance than the maximal function. In conclusion,
the normalized approach is the best choice for the selected
error model.
We also conducted simulations for the other error mod-
els with similar results. For the scenarios with more stable
and more correlated signals, we notice that the diﬀerences of
maximal, majority, and normalized functions is decreasing
and eventually the maximal distance performs as good as the
others within negligible margins. The usage of the maximal
distance can be beneﬁcial for setups with restricted compu-
tational resources since this function requires less compar-
isons. Nevertheless, the (normalized) majority voting ap-
proach is the optimal choice for all considered error models.
B. FURTHER MEASUREMENTS
We conducted further measurements between August 2015
and May 2016 to conﬁrm our error modeling approach in

diﬀerent environments. For instance, receivers were placed
close to metallic walls or near other noise sources. Over
diﬀerent time periods (up to three days non-stop) measure-
ments were collected to assess the eﬀects of signal reﬂections
and changing meteorological conditions. For the sake of clar-
ity, we only present resulting parameters for the standard
deviation and the correlation here.
Authentic. For receivers with clear line-of-sight, but un-
der multipath eﬀects, we experienced typical position noise
in the range of σ ≈ 0.746 to σ ≈ 3.063, where the latter was
measured close to a reﬂecting metallic wall. Similar degra-
dations can be observed for the correlation between position
changes. Additional noise sources can decrease the correla-
tion to ρ ≈ 0.265 for direct wall reﬂections. However, corre-
lations of ρ ≈ 0.820 were still measured for receivers aﬀected
by multipath signal components but with clear line-of-sight.
Spoofed. For our spooﬁng experiments we also varied the
antenna inclination due to the diﬀerent angle-of-arrival of
spooﬁng signals due to a ground level satellite simulator.
We tried establish similar power levels at the receiver to im-
itate conditions under normal operation. In all our experi-
ments, the spoofer was in close vicinity to the receivers. We
obtained the following typical results for the standard de-
viation and the correlation. For unfavorable environments,
the individual receiver’s position inaccuracy can increase to
σ ≈ 0.882 under spooﬁng. The correlation coeﬃcients across
several measurements maintained a comparably high level of
ρ ≈ 0.981 to ρ ≈ 0.463 in a worst case scenario.
3-day Experiment. This experiment was run over the
course of three days with m = 4 receivers and changing
weather conditions. Over 1,000,000 data points for each re-
ceiver were recorded. Figure 14 shows a histogram of all
relative distances. We note that the real distances between
the receivers were relatively small to shelter the devices from
rain. Outliers are still visible and could be caused by chang-
ing temperature and weather conditions.
