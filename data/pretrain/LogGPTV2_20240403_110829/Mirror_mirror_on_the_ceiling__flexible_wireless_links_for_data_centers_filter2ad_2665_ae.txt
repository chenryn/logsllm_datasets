the traﬃc is delegated to the wireless network, more racks
carry moderate traﬃc that leaves some number of radios
free for assignment.
In this case, optimizing radio assign-
ment provides some moderate beneﬁt, which is ultimately
bounded by the overhead of antenna rotation delay, shown
in Figure 8(b).
We also compare the amount of rotations performed by
each rotator using the two schedulers. Results in Table 1
show that depending on the traﬃc load given to the wireless
network, intelligent radio assignment can reduce the rotator
usage by up to 27%.

boring racks can only address a very limited (∼ 3%) por-
tion of traﬃc hotspots, compared to 100% for single hop 3D
beamforming links. Second, we ﬁnd that for many scenar-
ios involving bursty traﬃc hotspots, using 3D beamforming
links in conjunction with the existing wired network can gen-
erally reduce completion time by half or more. Finally, we

ﬁnd that when sizable payloads are involved, e.g. 128MB,
antenna rotation delays only contribute a small portion of
the overall completion time, and much of that can be recov-
ered using simple heuristics such as choosing radios that are
closer to the desired transmission angle.
6. DEPLOYMENT CHALLENGES
In this section, we brieﬂy discuss some key challenges of
deploying 3D beamforming in data centers.
Physical Rack/Reﬂector Placement.
3D beamform-
ing performs the best when there are no obstacles between
the top of rack/container and the ceiling. When physically
arranging racks/containers as well as ceiling reﬂectors, data
center managers should avoid obstacles such as cables and
cooling pipes. This is not an issue for container-based data
centers [10]. For other types of data centers, raised ﬂoors
can be used to house cables and pipes in the ground. Any
suspended cable trays can be concealed within aluminum-
plated ducts, essentially lowering the reﬂection point from
the ceiling. When unavoidable, one can also plan multi-
hop transmissions or reﬂect oﬀ walls to route around obsta-
cles. An open question is whether physical rack and reﬂector
placement can be jointly optimized with network communi-
cation patterns.
Reﬂector Curvature. We observe in our experiments
that the performance of 3D beamforming is sensitive to the
curvature of the reﬂector. Reﬂected by a ﬂat surface, the
beam propagates following the free-space model. When the
surface becomes slightly concave, we observe a visible in-
crease in the measured RSS value. Similarly, we observe
a drop when the surface becomes convex. This could be
the result of reﬂection creating multipath signals to the re-
ceiver, which could degrade the link performance. Ideally,
the reﬂector should be kept as ﬂat as possible. Yet an open
question is whether one can manipulate reﬂector curvature
to further improve 3D beamforming performance.
Rotator Reliability.
To communicate with diﬀerent
racks, each transceiver must adjust its beam direction in
both azimuth and elevation. For radios with horn antennas,
this requires a mechanical rotator to rotate the antenna,
leading to extra rotation delay and the issue of rotator re-
liability. Today’s oﬀ-the-shelf pan-tilt rotators can provide
roughly 3-5 million cycle durability [4] or 15,000-hour life-
time [9]. Clearly, the failure rates of these components must
be weighed against their performance when choosing be-
tween horn antennas and antenna arrays.
Antenna Arrays. The above concerns with rotator delay
and reliability can be addressed by replacing horn antennas
with switched beam smart antennas or antenna arrays. An-
tenna arrays use electronic beam rotation, with delay as low
as 50ns in existing 16-element arrays [40]. However, antenna
arrays still do not eliminate issues of link blockage or inter-
ference and produce more signal leakage than horn antennas,
leading to weaker link signal strength and stronger interfer-
ence to neighboring ﬂows [46]. One potential solution is
to conﬁgure beam patterns to steer away from neighboring
links or to nullify interference [33]. We leave exploration of
these issues for future study.
7. RELATED WORK
Data Center Networks.
Most prior work addresses
traﬃc congestion through network architecture design and
traﬃc scheduling [11, 13, 14, 18, 21, 22], or modeling net-
work traﬃc characteristics [15, 16, 25, 17]. 60 GHz wireless
was ﬁrst proposed to data center networking in [35] as a so-
lution to reduce the cabling complexity. Recent proposals
use wireless links to augment [23, 26] or replace [38] wired
links. In this work, we identify two practical issues of exist-
ing approaches, and propose a new beamforming paradigm
to eﬀectively address these issues.
While prior work has applied the principle of radio signal
reﬂection to connect non line-of-sight links [35] or to reduce
WiFi interference [31], we generalize it to 60GHz links. Our
key contribution is to use ceiling reﬂection in the data center
to extend connectivity and suppress interference. We also
used detailed hardware experiments to validate our design.
Optical circuit switching [20, 39, 42] is an alternative for
adding burst bandwidth to data centers. Optical circuit
switching promises tremendous bandwidth but the technol-
ogy incurs relatively substantial cost and does not oﬀer some
of the beneﬁts of wireless augmentation of data center band-
width, namely reduced cost and deployment complexity.
60GHz Wireless Technology.
Prior work mainly fo-
cuses on radio and antenna design issues [8, 40], and signal
propagation and reﬂection modeling [37, 45, 12, 30, 36]. To-
day, there is a wide selection of commercial 60GHz radio
products [5]. One recent eﬀort [40] developed a 16-element
on-chip antenna array, allowing each radio to switch a beam
to any of the 32 predeﬁned directions within 50ns. Our work
leverages readily available hardware, and focuses on design-
ing new wireless interconnects explicitly for data centers.
8. CONCLUSION
Traﬃc in today’s data centers is unpredictable, often pro-
ducing traﬃc hotspots that result in congestion and delay.
Instead of overprovisioning the wired network for bursts by
453rewiring a data center network at scale, we advocate the
use of 60 GHz wireless beamforming links to alleviate traﬃc
hotspots as they occur.
Our work addresses limitations of 60 GHz beamforming
that arise from signal blockage and interference caused by
signal leakage. Our insight is that by aiming 60 GHz beam-
forming links at a reﬂective ceiling, we can achieve indirect
line-of-sight between most or all rack pairs in a data cen-
ter, while minimizing interference. The net eﬀect is that
3D beamforming greatly expands the reach and capacity of
60 GHz links, making them feasible as ﬂexible and reconﬁg-
urable alternatives to wired cabling. Our testbed measure-
ments conﬁrm that 3D beamforming links suﬀer zero energy
loss from reﬂection, and eﬀectively avoid blocking obstacle
and reduce interference footprint.
While wired networks will continue to serve high-end data
center needs, we believe that eﬀorts such as 3D beamforming
can provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts to a broad range of data cen-
ter deployments, by potentially reducing deployment com-
plexity and reducing cost compared to a fully provisioned
wired network.
