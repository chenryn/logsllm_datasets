It seems this is mainly the cause of invalid nesting of tags, ``, ``, etc. I know there are some issues/PRs
regarding this already but AFAIK they're trying to solve/detect it, it seems
reasonable to just improve this (very non-informative) error message in the
meantime.
PS. I've probably seen 2-3 people get bitten by it myself now that I think
about it.
