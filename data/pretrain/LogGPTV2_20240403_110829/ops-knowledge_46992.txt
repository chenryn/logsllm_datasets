Question: "In designing a secure system that frequently passes objects to various methods, what are the primary considerations when choosing between cloning mutable objects versus using immutable objects as arguments?"
 "A": "Cloning preserves original object state but may incur performance overhead, while immutable objects ensure security without performance impact but may limit functionality."
 "B": "Cloning creates unnecessary redundancy in the codebase, while immutable objects can be altered without affecting the original object state."
 "C": "Cloning can lead to security vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly, while immutable objects prevent any form of object state modification."
 "D": "Cloning requires additional storage space, while immutable objects require complex refactoring of existing code to support immutability."
Answer: A
