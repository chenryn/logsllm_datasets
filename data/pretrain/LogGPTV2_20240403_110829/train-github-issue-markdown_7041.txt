I just downloaded VS2015 RTM and opened a project that I've been working on in
VS2013.
When I save a file, all I see is an error:
    Failed to save file 'compiled.js'.
where `compiled.js` is the `--out` argument, as indicated in the project
setting ("Combine JavaScript output into file").
There is no error or warning shown in the Error List window.
This seems to be similar to #3939, except that no redirect option is
specified.
