I recently installed Visual Studio 2015 RTM and opened a project that I had been working on in Visual Studio 2013. When I attempt to save a file, I encounter the following error message:

```
Failed to save file 'compiled.js'.
```

In this context, `compiled.js` is the output file specified by the `--out` argument, as configured in the project settings under "Combine JavaScript output into file."

Notably, no errors or warnings are displayed in the Error List window. This issue appears to be similar to the one described in #3939, with the exception that no redirect option is specified.

Could you please provide any guidance or suggestions on how to resolve this problem?
