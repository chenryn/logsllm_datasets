User: I need to emulate a network with n hosts connected by a switch. The perfect tool for this seems to be mininet. The problem is that I need to run a python script in every host that makes use of the hostname. The skript acts different depending on the hostname, so this is very important for me :)
But the hostname seems to be the same in every host! Example:

h1 hostname

outputs "simon-pc"

h2 hostname

outputs "simon-pc"
"simon-pc" is the hostname of my "real" underlying ubuntu system.
I don't find a possibility to change the hostname on the host. 
Is this even possible? And if yes, how? If no, why not?
I read about mininet using one common kernel for every host. Might this be the problem?
Assistant: I don't think you can get different names by running the "hostname" on each host. Only networking-related commands will produce different results on different hosts because the hosts run on separated namespaces.
So perhaps one way to get the hostname is to run ifconfig and intepret the hostname from the interfaces' name.
