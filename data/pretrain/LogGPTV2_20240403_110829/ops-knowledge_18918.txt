User: From a security point of view, how to protect an application from hackers? Please propose at least two security precautions and explain how they were implemented and their effects.
Assistant: 1. Conventional security measures: use firewalls, install anti-virus software, strengthen password security, etc. Firewalls can provide protection for the security of applications and limit intruders' access to applications; installing anti-virus software can detect possible security vulnerabilities and viruses in time ; Adopting a strong password policy can prevent hackers from using weak passwords to attack the system. 2. Write safe code: adopt safe coding standards, strengthen the processing of input data, etc. Adopt standard programming specifications to avoid potential security risks in the code, such as preventing buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS attacks, etc.; strengthen the protection of input data processing to prevent hackers from using malicious data to attack applications. The implementation methods of these two security measures are simple and easy, which can greatly reduce the threat of hacker attacks to the application program and improve the security of the application program.
