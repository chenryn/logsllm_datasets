Say I have a Controller with the following request mapping:
`@RequestMapping`(value = "/{group}/{identifier}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
**Current behavior:**
If one of the PathVariable components (e.g. "identifier" in the above example)
contains a URL encoded slash (%2F), the handler is NOT invoked for that
request, e.g.  
http://myhost/myservlet/group/a%2Fb
**Expected behavior:**
If one of the PathVariable comonents (e.g. "identifier" in the above example)
contains a URL encoded slash (%2F), the handler is invoked for that request
and the URL decoded value is assigned to the path variable, e.g.  
http://myhost/myservlet/group/a%2Fb
calls the handler method above with group="group" and identifier="a/b"
This is supported by the RFC which assigns special meaning to the slash
character and states a slash and a URL encoded slash are NOT the same
character:
RFC 3986 says (section 2.2) :  
The purpose of reserved characters is to provide a set of delimiting  
characters that are distinguishable from other data within a URI.  
URIs that differ in the replacement of a reserved character with its  
corresponding percent-encoded octet are not equivalent. Percent-  
encoding a reserved character, or decoding a percent-encoded octet  
that corresponds to a reserved character, will change how the URI is  
interpreted by most applications. Thus, characters in the reserved  
set are protected from normalization and are therefore safe to be  
used by scheme-specific and producer-specific algorithms for  
delimiting data subcomponents within a URI.
The actual URL decoding happens in UrlPathHelper.getLookupPathForRequest which
eventually calls getRequestUri which calls decodeAndCleanUriString. This is
basically too early. First the handler should be chosen and the PathVariables
assigned. Then URL decoding should happen on each of the path variables'
values.
If desired I can write a unit test or include a sample Controller to reproduce
the above.
**Note:** Tomcat MUST be started with the
-Dorg.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH=true option or the
request will never even land at the Spring DispatcherServlet.
