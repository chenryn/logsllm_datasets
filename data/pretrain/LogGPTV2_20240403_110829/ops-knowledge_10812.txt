User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题svscan error when installing qmail I'm quite new to Linux and I'm running into an issue. Searched everywhere, without finding a solution.

I tried to install qmail following these instructions. Before finishing and starting the service, you can perform a final check.

This is the output:  

'! svscan /service' doesn't seem to be running
! /var/log/qmail has wrong mode, should be 750
...try: chmod 750 /var/log/qmail
! /var/log/qmail/qmail-smtpd has wrong mode, should be 750
...try: chmod 750 /var/log/qmail/qmail-smtpd
! /var/log/qmail/qmail-pop3d has wrong mode, should be 750
...try: chmod 750 /var/log/qmail/qmail-pop3d

I guess my first problem would be to get svscan running, but everything I try seems to fail.

My Centos version: Linux version 2.6.32-279.14.1.el6.x86_64 (mockbuild@c6b8.bsys.dev.centos.org) (gcc version 4.4.6 20120305 (Red Hat 4.4.6-4) (GCC) ) #1 SMP Tue Nov 6 23:43:09 UTC 2012

If you need any more information, please let me know. Any help would be very much appreciated.

Assistant: svscan is run under /etc/init.d so you should start looking there to see if it was started.
Also try 

ps -ef|grep readproctitle


does the above return any errors ? 

further more : 
You have wrong permissions in your /var/log/qmail directories. 

Do chmod -R 750 /var/log/qmail to fix that.

Also you need to create the tcp.smtp file 

echo '127.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""' &gt;&gt; /etc/tcp.smtp


and then qmailctl cdb

Also you seem to not haven't set the proper aliases 

echo root@mail.com &gt; /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-root
echo postmaster@mail.com &gt; /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-postmaster
echo daemon@mail.com &gt; /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-mailer-daemon
ln -s /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-root /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-anonymous 
chmod 644 /var/qmail/alias/.qmail*


Lastly to be frank QMailRocks (which it seems the site you follow pretty much copies) has not been maintained in ages and ages as a guide to setup Qmail. Try and visit qmail.jms1.net for a bit updated info
