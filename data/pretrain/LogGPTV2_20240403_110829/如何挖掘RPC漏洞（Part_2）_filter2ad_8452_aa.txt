## 一、前言
在之前的一篇[文章](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/the-case-studies-of-microsoft-windows-remote-procedure-call-serv.html)中（[译文](https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/167427)），FortiGuard实验室与大家分享了如何使用RPCView来寻找RPC服务器中的逻辑漏洞，最终我们在Microsoft
Universal Telemetry服务中发现了一个潜在问题。
大家可能还记得，在上篇文章中我们讨论了如何通过RPCView寻找输入参数为字符串的RPC
API。然而，使用RPCView时有一些限制条件，比如RPCView不会显示Windows没有在默认情况下自动启动的RPC服务（如Data Sharing
Service）。之前我们无法识别这个服务，现在我们可以使用另一种方法来识别该服务（下文会介绍）。经过分析后我们发现，这个服务同样存在一些权限提升问题，而使用我们增强版的方法可以发现这些问题。
Google安全研究员James
Forshaw最终反馈了4个安全漏洞，MSRC已于去年12月份修复这些漏洞。此外，虽然RPCView非常有用，但使用起来也比较耗时，我们需要逐项审核接收字符串参数的所有API。因此，我们希望能找到节省时间的其他办法。
我们首先分析了之前发现的一些bug，这些bug非常相似，都有一个共同点：这些服务都会调用`SetNamedSecurityInfo`这个Windows
API，该API允许应用程序通过对象名称，在指定对象的安全描述符中设置指定的安全信息。例如，如果操作目标为文件对象，那么应用程序就可以指定文件名。
这里我们想强调一点，这个Windows
API并没有存在任何安全问题，然而当我们使用自己开发的静态分析工具来搜索RPC服务时，可以将该API当成过滤器来使用。了解到这一点后，我们创建了一个简单工具，可以静态解析所有的RPC服务程序，寻找感兴趣的Windows
API，进一步缩小需要深入研究的RPC服务范围。
经过分析后，我们发现了一些比较有趣的RPC服务。比如Storage
Service（也称为StorSvc），该服务中存在之前尚未发现的多个权限提升问题；还有AppX Deployment
Server，该服务可能存在竞争条件问题，最终导致权限提升。FortiGuard实验室随后向微软安全响应中心（MSRC）反馈了这些漏洞，微软及时修复了这些漏洞，对应的编号为[CVE-2019-0569](https://fortiguard.com/zeroday/FG-VD-18-145)以及[CVE-2019-0766](https://fortiguard.com/zeroday/FG-VD-18-151)。
接下来我们将与大家分享我们发现这些漏洞的具体过程。
