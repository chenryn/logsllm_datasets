Subject: Critical Bug Report - Urgent Fix Requested

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to report a significant issue that is currently impacting the functionality of my application. This bug, which mirrors the behavior described in issue #3775, is causing a considerable delay in our development process. I kindly request your urgent attention to this matter, as resolving it would greatly assist in moving our project forward.

**Issue Description:**
The problem occurs when using dynamic imports with the `dynamic` function from `next/dynamic`. The loading component does not display correctly, and the application hangs indefinitely. Below is an example of the code that reproduces the issue:

```javascript
const LoadProfile = dynamic(() => import('../components/Profile/LoadProfile'), {
  loading: () => <div>Loading Profile...</div>
});

const Profile = ({ username }) => (
  <LoadProfile username={username} />
);
```

**Impact:**
This bug is preventing us from proceeding with our development, as we rely heavily on dynamic imports to optimize the performance of our application. Without a fix, we will be forced to use static imports, which would significantly degrade the overall performance.

**Request:**
Could you please provide an update on when this issue might be addressed? Any assistance or guidance you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Best regards,
