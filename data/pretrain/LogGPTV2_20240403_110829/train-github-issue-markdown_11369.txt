Wanted to create another issue for this, as this is a very import bug that is
occurring; which hopefully can be fixed soon :(
Same issue/behavior as #3775.
Example code:
    const LoadProfile = dynamic(import('../components/Profile/LoadProfile'), {
      loading: () => Loading Profile...
    })
    const Profile = ({ username }) => (
          Profile ({username})
    )
Any updates on when this can be fixed? I'm kinda in a standstill rn and
without using dynamic imports it will severely hurt the performance of my
application.
Thanks for any support/help!
