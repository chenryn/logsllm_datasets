User: You need to configure a group of Nginx servers to balance traffic while ensuring security. Please provide a scheme of Nginx load balancer and explain how to configure it.
Assistant: Solution: Use Nginx to build 3 servers, the first of which acts as a load balancer and is responsible for distributing requests to the other two servers. The second and third servers are web servers, and they are used to provide services. Nginx's load balancing module can distribute requests in the following ways: 1. Round robin mode (default): distribute requests to each server in order of their weight (if set). 2. IP hash mode: By hashing the client IP address, the request is directed to a specific server. 3. Least number of connections mode: Distribute requests to the server with the least number of current connections to achieve load balancing. To realize the load balancing function of Nginx, Nginx needs to be configured as follows: 1. Install Nginx on the load balancer server and create a file named "nginx.conf". 2. In the nginx.conf file, add the upstream section to the IP address and port number of the server: upstream backend { server 192.168.10.11:80 weight=5; server 192.168.10.12:80 weight=5; } 3. On server section to enable load balancing: location / { proxy_pass http://backend; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; } where "proxy_pass" indicates that the request will be forwarded to the upstream server, "X-Forwarded-For" and "Host" get information from request headers. 4. Install Nginx on the web server and configure it to listen on the local IP address and port number, and configure the service. The above is a simple Nginx load balancer solution. In practical applications, more complex configurations can be performed on load balancing according to specific requirements.
