In addition to process activities, there are many useful acquisition security-enhancing tools and 
techniques available, including obscuring the system end use or system component, using blind 
or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. 
The results of a supply chain cybersecurity risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, 
tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools, techniques, and practices may 
provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, 
insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the 
system development life cycle.   
To ensure the effective and continued management of cybersecurity risks across the supply chain 
and throughout the acquisition life cycle, contractual agreements and contract management 
should include: 
• 
The satisfaction of applicable security requirements in contracts and mechanisms as a 
qualifying condition for award; 
• 
Flow-down control requirements to subcontractors, if and when applicable, including C-
SCRM performance objectives linked to the method of inspection in a Quality Assurance 
Surveillance Plan or equivalent method for monitoring performance; 
• 
The periodic revalidation of supplier adherence to security requirements to ensure continual 
compliance; 
• 
Processes and protocols for communication and the reporting of information about 
vulnerabilities, incidents, and other business disruptions, including acceptable deviations if 
the business disruption is deemed serious and baseline criteria to determine whether a 
disruption qualifies as serious; and 
• 
Terms and conditions that address the government, supplier, and other applicable third-
party roles, responsibilities, and actions for responding to identified supply chain risks or 
risk incidents in order to mitigate risk exposure, minimize harm, and support timely 
corrective action or recovery from an incident. 
There are a variety of acceptable validation and revalidation methods, such as requisite 
certifications, site visits, third-party assessments, or self-attestation. The type and rigor of the 
required methods should be commensurate with the criticality of the service or product being 
acquired and the corresponding assurance requirements. 
 Additional guidance for integrating C-SCRM into the acquisition process is provided in 
Appendix C, which demonstrates the enhanced overlay of C-SCRM into the [NIST SP 800-39] 
Risk Management Process. In addition, enterprises should refer to and follow the acquisition and 
procurement policies, regulations, and best practices that are specific to their domain (e.g., 
critical infrastructure sector, state government, etc.).

3.2. 
Supply Chain Information Sharing 
Enterprises are continuously exposed to risk originating from their supply chains. An effective 
information-sharing process helps to ensure that enterprises can gain access to information that is 
critical to understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain and also 
share relevant information with others that may benefit from or require awareness of these risks.  
To aid in identifying, assessing, monitoring, and responding to cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain, enterprises should build information-sharing processes and activities into their C-
SCRM programs. This may include establishing information-sharing agreements with peer 
enterprises, business partners, and suppliers. By exchanging Supply Chain Risk Information 
(SCRI) within a sharing community, enterprises can leverage the collective knowledge, 
experience, and capabilities of that sharing community to gain a more complete understanding of 
the threats that the enterprise may face. Additionally, the sharing of SCRI allows enterprises to 
better detect campaigns that target specific industry sectors and institutions. However, the 
enterprise should be sure that information sharing occurs through formal sharing structures, such 
as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). Informal or unmanaged information 
sharing can expose enterprises to potential legal risks.   
Federal enterprises should establish processes to effectively engage with the FASC’s 
information-sharing agency, which is responsible for facilitating information sharing among 
government agencies and acting as a central, government-wide facilitator for C-SCRM 
information-sharing activities.  
NIST SP 800-150 describes key practices for establishing and participating in SCRI-sharing 
relationships, including: 
• Establish information-sharing goals and objectives that support business processes and 
security policies 
• Identify existing internal sources of SCRI 
• Specify the scope of information-sharing activities27 
• Establish information-sharing rules 
• Join and participate in information-sharing efforts 
• Actively seek to enrich indicators by providing additional context, corrections, or 
suggested improvements 
• Use secure, automated workflows to publish, consume, analyze, and act upon SCRI 
• Proactively establish SCRI-sharing agreements 
• Protect the security and privacy of sensitive information 
27 The scope of information sharing activities should include the data classification level that was approved at the most recent risk assessment for 
a supplier and the data types that were approved for that supplier. For example, if an assessment was performed for data at a certain classification 
level (e.g., Business Confidential) and the scope of the engagement changes to include data at a new classification level (e.g., restricted), the risk 
assessment needs to be refreshed.

• Provide ongoing support for information-sharing activities 
As shown in Table 3-2, below, SCRI describes or identifies the cybersecurity supply chain 
relevant characteristics and risk factors associated with a product, service, or source of supply. It 
may exist in various forms (e.g., raw data, a supply chain network map, risk assessment report, 
etc.) and should be accompanied by the metadata that will facilitate an assessment of a level of 
confidence in and credibility of the information. Enterprises should follow established processes 
and procedures that describe whether and when the sharing or reporting of certain information is 
mandated or voluntary and if there are any necessary requirements to adhere to regarding 
information handling, protection, and classification.

C-SCRM Training and Awareness 
Numerous individuals within the enterprise contribute to the success of C-SCRM. These may 
include information security, procurement, risk management, engineering, software 
development, IT, legal, HR, and program managers. Examples of these groups’ contributions 
include: 
• System Owners are responsible for multiple facets of C-SCRM at the operational level as 
part of their responsibility for the development, procurement, integration, modification, 
operation, maintenance, and/or final disposition of an information system. 
• Human Resources defines and implements background checks and training policies, 
which help ensure that individuals are trained in appropriate C-SCRM processes and 
procedures. 
• Legal helps draft or review C-SCRM-specific contractual language that is included by 
procurement in contracts with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.  
• Acquisition/procurement defines the process for implementing supplier assurance 
practices embedded in the acquisition process.  
• Engineering designs products and must understand existing requirements for the use of 
open source components.  
• Software developers ensure that software weaknesses and vulnerabilities are identified 
and addressed as early as possible, including testing and fixing code.  
• Shipping and receiving ensures that boxes containing critical components have not been 
tampered with en route or at the warehouse. 
• Project managers ensure that project plans are developed and include C-SCRM 
considerations as part of the project plan and execution.  
Everyone within an enterprise, including the end users of information systems, has a role in 
managing cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. The enterprise should foster an 
overall culture of security that includes C-SCRM as an integral part. The enterprise can use a 
variety of communication methods to foster the culture, of which traditional awareness and role-
based training are only one component.

Every individual within an enterprise should receive appropriate training to enable them to 
understand the importance of C-SCRM to their enterprise, their specific roles and 
responsibilities, and as it relates to processes and procedures for reporting incidents. This 
training can be integrated into the overall cybersecurity awareness training. Enterprises should 
define baseline training requirements at a broad scope within Level 1, and those requirements 
should be tailored and refined based on the specific context within Level 2 and Level 3.  
Those individuals who have more significant roles in managing cybersecurity risks throughout 
the supply chain should receive tailored C-SCRM training that helps them understand the scope 
of their responsibilities, the specific processes and procedure implementations for which they are 
responsible, and the actions to take in the event of an incident, disruption, or another C-SCRM-
related event. The enterprises should establish specific role-based training criteria and develop 
role-specific C-SCRM training to address C-SCRM roles and responsibilities. The enterprise 
may also consider adding C-SCRM content into preexisting role-based training for some specific 
roles. Refer to the Awareness and Training controls in Section 4.5 for more detail. 
Enterprises are encouraged to utilize the NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education 
(NICE) Framework30 as a means of forming a common lexicon for C-SCRM workforce topics. 
This will aid enterprises in developing training linked to role-specific C-SCRM responsibilities 
and communicating cybersecurity workforce-related topics. The NICE Framework outlines 
Categories; Specialty Areas; Work Roles; Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs); and Tasks 
that describe cybersecurity work. 
3.4. 
C-SCRM Key Practices31 
Cybersecurity supply chain risk management builds on existing standardized practices in 
multiple disciplines and an ever-evolving set of C-SCRM capabilities. C-SCRM Key Practices 
are meant to specifically emphasize and draw attention to a subset of the C-SCRM practices 
described throughout this publication. Enterprises should prioritize achieving a base-level of 
maturity in these key practices prior to advancing on to additional C-SCRM capabilities. 
Enterprises should tailor their implementation of these practices to what is applicable and 
appropriate given their unique context (e.g., based on available resources and risk profile). C-
SCRM Key Practices are described in NIST standards and guidelines, such as [NISTIR 8276], 
and other applicable national and international standards. C-SCRM Practices include integrating 
C-SCRM across the enterprise; establishing a formal program; knowing and managing critical 
products, services, and suppliers; understanding an enterprise’s supply chain; closely 
collaborating with critical suppliers; including critical suppliers in resilience and improvement 
activities; assessing and monitoring throughout the supplier relationship; and planning for the 
full life cycle. 
30 See NIST SP 800-181, National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.  
31 Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity.

3.4.1. Foundational Practices 
Having foundational practices in place is critical to successfully and productively interacting 
with system integrators. Suppliers may be at varying levels with regard to having the 
standardized practices in place. The following are specific examples of the recommended 
multidisciplinary foundational practices that can be incrementally implemented to improve an 
enterprise’s ability to develop and execute more advanced C-SCRM practices: 
• Establish a core, dedicated, multidisciplinary C-SCRM Program Management Office 
and/or C-SCRM team.  
• Obtain senior leadership support for establishing and/or enhancing C-SCRM.  
• Implement a risk management hierarchy and risk management process (in accordance 
with NIST SP 800-39, Managing Information Security Risk [NIST SP 800-39]), 
including an enterprise-wide risk assessment process (in accordance with NIST SP 800-
30, Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments [NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1]).  
• Establish an enterprise governance structure that integrates C-SCRM requirements and 
incorporates these requirements into the enterprise policies.  
• Develop a process for identifying and measuring the criticality of the enterprise’s 
suppliers, products, and services.  
• Raise awareness and foster understanding of what C-SCRM is and why it is critically 
important.  
• Develop and/or integrate C-SCRM into acquisition/procurement policies and procedures 
(including Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act [FITARA] 
processes, applicable to federal agencies) and purchase card processes. Supervisors and 
managers should also ensure that their staff aims to build C-SCRM competencies. 
• Establish consistent, well-documented, repeatable processes for determining Federal 
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 199 impact levels. 
• Establish and begin using supplier risk-assessment processes on a prioritized basis 
(inclusive of criticality analysis, threat analysis, and vulnerability analysis) after the 
[FIPS 199] impact level has been defined. 
• Implement a quality and reliability program that includes quality assurance and quality 
control process and practices. 
• Establish explicit collaborative and discipline-specific roles, accountabilities, structures, 
and processes for supply chain, cybersecurity, product security, physical security, and 
other relevant processes (e.g., Legal, Risk Executive, HR, Finance, Enterprise IT, 
Program Management/System Engineering, Information Security, 
Acquisition/Procurement, Supply Chain Logistics, etc.). 
• Ensure that adequate resources are dedicated and allocated to information security and C-
SCRM to ensure proper implementation of policy, guidance, and controls. 
• Ensure sufficient cleared personnel with key C-SCRM roles and responsibilities to access 
and share C-SCRM-related classified information. 
• Implement an appropriate and tailored set of baseline information security controls found 
in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems 
and Enterprises [NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 5].

• Establish internal checks and balances to ensure compliance with security and quality 
requirements.  
• Establish a supplier management program that includes, for example, guidelines for 
purchasing from qualified original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)32 or their 
authorized distributors and resellers. 
• Implement a robust incident management program to successfully identify, respond to, 
and mitigate security incidents. This program should be capable of identifying the root 
cause of security incidents, including those that originate from the cybersecurity supply 
chain. 
• Establish internal processes to validate that suppliers and service providers actively 
identify and disclose vulnerabilities in their products.  
• Establish a governance capability for managing and monitoring components of embedded 
software to manage risk across the enterprise (e.g., SBOMs paired with criticality, 
vulnerability, threat, and exploitability to make this more automated). 
3.4.2. Sustaining Practices 
Sustaining practices should be used to enhance the efficacy of cybersecurity supply chain risk 
management. These practices are inclusive of and build upon foundational practices. Enterprises 
that have broadly standardized and implemented the foundational practices should consider these 
as the next steps in advancing their cybersecurity supply chain risk management capabilities: 
• Establish and collaborate with a threat-informed security program. 
• Use confidence-building mechanisms, such as third-party assessment surveys, on-site 
visits, and formal certifications (e.g., ISO 27001) to assess critical supplier security 
capabilities and practices. 
• Establish formal processes and intervals for continuous monitoring and reassessment of 
suppliers, supplied products and services, and the supply chain itself for potential changes 
to the risk profile. 
• Use the enterprise’s understanding of its C-SCRM risk profile (or risk profiles specific to 
mission and business areas) to define a risk appetite and risk tolerances to empower 
leaders with delegated authority across the enterprise to make C-SCRM decisions in 
alignment with the enterprise’s mission imperatives and strategic goals and objectives. 
• Use a formalized information-sharing function to engage with ISACs, the FASC, and 
other government agencies to enhance the enterprise’s supply chain cybersecurity threat 
and risk insights and help ensure a coordinated and holistic approach to addressing 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain that may affect a broader set of agencies, 
the private sector, or national security.  
• Coordinate with the enterprise’s cybersecurity program leadership to elevate top C-
SCRM Risk Profile risks to the most senior enterprise risk committee.  
• Embed C-SCRM-specific training into the training curriculums of applicable roles across 
the enterprise processes involved with C-SCRM, including information security, 
procurement, risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, and HR. 
32 For purposes of this publication, the term original equipment manufacturers is inclusive of original component manufacturers.

• Integrate C-SCRM considerations into every aspect of the system and product life cycle, 
and implement consistent, well-documented, repeatable processes for systems 
engineering, cybersecurity practices, and acquisition.  
• Integrate the enterprise’s defined C-SCRM requirements into the contractual language 
found in agreements with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system 
service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. 
• Include critical suppliers in contingency planning, incident response, and disaster 
recovery planning and testing. 
• Engage with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, 
and other ICT/OT-related service providers to improve their cybersecurity practices.  
• Define, collect, and report C-SCRM metrics to ensure risk-aware leadership, enable 
active management of the completeness of C-SCRM implementations, and drive the 
efficacy of the enterprise’s C-SCRM processes and practices.
