### Continuous Risk Monitoring

In addition to process activities, several acquisition security-enhancing tools and techniques are available. These include obscuring the system's end use or components, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, and employing trusted or controlled distribution. The results of a supply chain cybersecurity risk assessment can guide and inform the most applicable strategies, tools, and methods for the situation. These measures can protect against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, malicious software, backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle.

### Contractual Agreements and Contract Management

To ensure effective and continuous management of cybersecurity risks across the supply chain and throughout the acquisition life cycle, contractual agreements and contract management should include:

- **Security Requirements Compliance:** Satisfying applicable security requirements in contracts and mechanisms as a qualifying condition for award.
- **Flow-Down Control Requirements:** Flowing down control requirements to subcontractors, if applicable, including C-SCRM performance objectives linked to the method of inspection in a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan or equivalent monitoring method.
- **Periodic Revalidation:** Periodically revalidating supplier adherence to security requirements to ensure continual compliance.
- **Communication and Reporting Protocols:** Establishing processes and protocols for communication and reporting of information about vulnerabilities, incidents, and other business disruptions, including acceptable deviations for serious disruptions and baseline criteria to determine their severity.
- **Terms and Conditions for Incident Response:** Addressing the roles, responsibilities, and actions of the government, suppliers, and other third parties in responding to identified supply chain risks or risk incidents to mitigate risk exposure, minimize harm, and support timely corrective action or recovery from an incident.

### Validation and Revalidation Methods

Various validation and revalidation methods are acceptable, such as requisite certifications, site visits, third-party assessments, or self-attestation. The type and rigor of these methods should be commensurate with the criticality of the service or product being acquired and the corresponding assurance requirements.

### Integration of C-SCRM into the Acquisition Process

Additional guidance for integrating C-SCRM into the acquisition process is provided in Appendix C, which demonstrates the enhanced overlay of C-SCRM into the [NIST SP 800-39] Risk Management Process. Enterprises should also refer to and follow the acquisition and procurement policies, regulations, and best practices specific to their domain (e.g., critical infrastructure sector, state government, etc.).

### Supply Chain Information Sharing

Enterprises are continuously exposed to risks originating from their supply chains. An effective information-sharing process ensures that enterprises can access critical information for understanding and mitigating cybersecurity risks. To aid in identifying, assessing, monitoring, and responding to these risks, enterprises should build information-sharing processes and activities into their C-SCRM programs. This may include establishing information-sharing agreements with peer enterprises, business partners, and suppliers.

By exchanging Supply Chain Risk Information (SCRI) within a sharing community, enterprises can leverage collective knowledge, experience, and capabilities to gain a more complete understanding of potential threats. Additionally, SCRI sharing helps detect campaigns targeting specific industry sectors and institutions. However, information sharing should occur through formal structures, such as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs), to avoid potential legal risks.

Federal enterprises should establish processes to engage with the FASCâ€™s information-sharing agency, which facilitates information sharing among government agencies and acts as a central, government-wide facilitator for C-SCRM information-sharing activities.

### Key Practices for SCRI Sharing

NIST SP 800-150 describes key practices for establishing and participating in SCRI-sharing relationships, including:

- Establishing information-sharing goals and objectives.
- Identifying existing internal sources of SCRI.
- Specifying the scope of information-sharing activities.
- Establishing information-sharing rules.
- Joining and participating in information-sharing efforts.
- Enriching indicators by providing additional context, corrections, or suggested improvements.
- Using secure, automated workflows to publish, consume, analyze, and act upon SCRI.
- Proactively establishing SCRI-sharing agreements.
- Protecting the security and privacy of sensitive information.
- Providing ongoing support for information-sharing activities.

### C-SCRM Training and Awareness

Numerous individuals within the enterprise contribute to the success of C-SCRM, including information security, procurement, risk management, engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR, and program managers. Each group has specific responsibilities, such as:

- **System Owners:** Responsible for multiple facets of C-SCRM at the operational level.
- **Human Resources:** Defines and implements background checks and training policies.
- **Legal:** Drafts or reviews C-SCRM-specific contractual language.
- **Acquisition/Procurement:** Defines the process for implementing supplier assurance practices.
- **Engineering:** Designs products and understands open source component requirements.
- **Software Developers:** Ensures software weaknesses and vulnerabilities are identified and addressed.
- **Shipping and Receiving:** Ensures boxes containing critical components have not been tampered with.
- **Project Managers:** Develops project plans that include C-SCRM considerations.

Everyone within the enterprise, including end users of information systems, has a role in managing cybersecurity risks. The enterprise should foster a culture of security that includes C-SCRM as an integral part. Communication methods, including traditional awareness and role-based training, should be used to promote this culture.

### C-SCRM Key Practices

C-SCRM builds on existing standardized practices in multiple disciplines and an evolving set of C-SCRM capabilities. Key practices include:

- **Foundational Practices:**
  - Establishing a core, dedicated, multidisciplinary C-SCRM Program Management Office.
  - Obtaining senior leadership support.
  - Implementing a risk management hierarchy and process.
  - Establishing an enterprise governance structure.
  - Developing a process for identifying and measuring the criticality of suppliers, products, and services.
  - Raising awareness and fostering understanding of C-SCRM.
  - Integrating C-SCRM into acquisition/procurement policies.
  - Establishing consistent, well-documented, repeatable processes for determining FIPS 199 impact levels.
  - Implementing a quality and reliability program.
  - Establishing explicit collaborative and discipline-specific roles.
  - Allocating adequate resources to information security and C-SCRM.
  - Implementing baseline information security controls.
  - Establishing internal checks and balances.
  - Implementing a supplier management program.
  - Implementing a robust incident management program.
  - Validating that suppliers and service providers identify and disclose vulnerabilities.
  - Establishing a governance capability for managing embedded software components.

- **Sustaining Practices:**
  - Establishing and collaborating with a threat-informed security program.
  - Using confidence-building mechanisms to assess critical supplier security capabilities.
  - Establishing formal processes for continuous monitoring and reassessment.
  - Defining a risk appetite and risk tolerances.
  - Engaging with ISACs, the FASC, and other government agencies.
  - Elevating top C-SCRM risks to the senior enterprise risk committee.
  - Embedding C-SCRM-specific training into applicable roles.
  - Integrating C-SCRM considerations into every aspect of the system and product life cycle.
  - Integrating C-SCRM requirements into contractual language.
  - Including critical suppliers in contingency planning and disaster recovery.
  - Engaging with suppliers to improve their cybersecurity practices.
  - Defining, collecting, and reporting C-SCRM metrics.
