User: I've installed Miniconda and have added the environment variable export PATH="/home/username/miniconda3/bin:$PATH" to my .bashrc and .bash_profile but still can't run any conda commands in my terminal.
Am I missing another step in my setup? I'm using zsh by the way.
Assistant: I have encountered this problem lately and I have found a solution that worked for me. It is possible that your current user might not have permissions to anaconda directory, so check if you can read/write there, and if not, then change the files owner by using chown.
