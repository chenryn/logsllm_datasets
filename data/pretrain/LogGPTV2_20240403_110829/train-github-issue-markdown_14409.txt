### Description
When running the Scrapy shell with the following command:
```sh
scrapy shell https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/344192245
```
the following error is displayed:
```
MemoryError: Cannot allocate write+execute memory for ffi.callback(). You might be running on a system that prevents this. For more information, see https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#callbacks
```

This error indicates that the system is unable to allocate memory with both write and execute permissions, which is required by the `ffi.callback()` function from the `cffi` library. This issue can occur on systems with security measures that restrict such memory allocations.

For more details and potential solutions, please refer to the [cffi documentation](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#callbacks).
