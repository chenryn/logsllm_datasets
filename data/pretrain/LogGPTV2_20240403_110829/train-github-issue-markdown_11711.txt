Will be great if we can duplicate/divide terminal screen like tmux or cmdr
using some key shortcuts like Ctrl + Alt + H for horizontal division or Ctrl +
Alt + V for vertical, and the new terminal need open in the same path of the
previous terminal if we are in c:\Users the new terminal need open in the same
place, if we are in Linux using /home/ the new need do the same thing and open
in same /home directory.
