User:  Is this log an error log? nova-compute.log.1.2017-05-16_13:55:31 2017-05-16 00:00:04.693 2931 INFO nova.compute.manager [req-3ea4052c-895d-4b64-9e2d-04d64c4d94ab - - - - -] [instance: b9000564-fe1a-409b-b8cc-1e88b294cd1d] During sync_power_state the instance has a pending task (spawning). Skip.
Assistant: Whether there is an exception: no exception Description: This log records that when the nova compute manager performs the sync_power_state operation, it finds that the virtual machine is in the spawning state, so the synchronization is skipped. The pending task is a normal operation in the spawning state. The only function of processing this log record is to record the event in the log file for future performance optimization or failure analysis.
