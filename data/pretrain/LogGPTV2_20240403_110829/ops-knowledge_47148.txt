User: I wrote a TCP server using Python Twisted to send/receive binary data from clients. 
When a client close their application or calls the abortConnection method, I get the connectionLost event normally but when the client disconnects unexpectedly, I don't get the disconnect event, therefore, I can't remove the disconnected client from the queue.
By unexpected disconnect I mean disabling the network adapter or lost the network connection somehow.
My question is, how can I handle this sort of unexpected connection losts?
Assistant: The only way to support a cross-platform unexpected disconnection (unplug) is to implement a application-level ping message to ping clients in a specific interval.
