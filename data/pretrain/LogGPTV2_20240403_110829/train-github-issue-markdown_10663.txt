I believe that `@types/node-schedule` should not list `@types/node` as a direct dependency. Instead, it should be included in the `peerDependencies`. This change is necessary to avoid potential version conflicts with other installed versions of `@types/node`, which may exist at a higher level in the project.

Additionally, I am unsure where the `package.json` file for this package can be contributed to, as I do not see one in the following repository:
https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/types-2.0/node-schedule

Could you please provide guidance on this matter?
