I believe `@types/node-schedule` should not depend on `@types/node` (currently
it is in `dependencies`), it should be added in `peerDependencies`, because
otherwise it may result in conflicts, with other installed version (maybe on
the upper level of the project).
I don't get where the `package.json can` be contributed to? I see no
`package.json` here:

schedule
