I've modified the DatePicker component to meet a need for a project and wanted
to contribute the changes back to the core project (:
The modification - an additional prop viewYearFirst={true} which opens the
datepicker directly to the year display.
I just wanted to check in to see if the prop name was appropriate and whether
or not any core developers could spot any gotchas before I roll this up into a
PR.
Thanks!
