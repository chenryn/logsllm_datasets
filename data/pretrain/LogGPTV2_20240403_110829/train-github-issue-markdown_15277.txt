I have made modifications to the `DatePicker` component for a specific project requirement and would like to contribute these changes back to the core project.

The modification introduces an additional prop, `viewYearFirst={true}`, which allows the date picker to open directly to the year selection view. 

Before I proceed with creating a pull request, I wanted to confirm if the prop name is appropriate and if any core developers could identify potential issues or improvements. 

Thank you!
