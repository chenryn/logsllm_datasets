User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Where are MySQL users and passwords stored? When I delete 'mysql'.'user' table I'm still able to log in as any user I've created before.

How is this possible?

Assistant: User/permission information is cached in memory. Use 'FLUSH PRIVILEGES' after editing the user table directly, to reload it. Although you might not want to do that in this case, depending on what you are trying to achieve.
