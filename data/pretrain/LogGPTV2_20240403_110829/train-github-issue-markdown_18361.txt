The Git history for this repository is invalid. You'll run into this if you
enable verification of the history in your configuration (which should really
be the default):
    [transfer]
        fsckobjects = true
    [fetch]
        fsckobjects = true
    [receive]
        fsckobjects = true
    % git clone https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests.git
    Cloning into 'requests'...
    remote: Counting objects: 16580, done.
    error: object 5e6ecdad9f69b1ff789a17733b8edc6fd7091bd8: badTimezone: invalid author/committer line - bad time zone
    fatal: Error in object
If you look at the commit with verification disabled, you can see the problem:
    commit 5e6ecdad9f69b1ff789a17733b8edc6fd7091bd8

        Typo in documentation
        The kwarg is named `headers`, not `header`. Also, its a dict, not a set.
I don't have a suggestion on how to approach this. It's quite unfortunate. The
history would probably have to be rewritten, and that would be awful. I do
think it's worth noting though... verification by default may become the
default on various distributions or even upstream.
