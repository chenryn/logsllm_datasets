#### Code Sample
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    S = pd.Series([np.nan,1.5,np.nan,2,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,1,1,2,2,2,3])
    print S; print; print set(S)
#### Problem description
The NaNs show up multiple times in set(S), which is not a problem if
    S = [np.nan,1.5,np.nan,2,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,1,1,2,2,2,3]
is used instead. The multiple NaNs in set(S) also become very slow to run if
    S = pd.Series([np.nan,1.5,np.nan,2,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan,1,1,2,2,2,3] + [np.nan] * 100000)
is used. Without pd.Series it's a flash of a second.
