User: How to realize real-time monitoring and visual display of network performance through the monitoring system? Please provide a feasible plan and a technical realization plan.
Assistant: Feasible solution: 1. Choose a professional network monitoring software, such as the famous Nagios Network Monitor, Zabbix, Cacti, etc., which can monitor the Internet, LAN, wireless network, etc. 2. Use network testing tools, such as Ping or Traceroute, to perform network delay testing and bandwidth testing to obtain basic information about the network. 3. Realize the monitoring and management of routers, switches, firewalls, servers and other devices through the device monitor. 4. Use log analysis tools to monitor network data transmission, performance data of network devices, and identify abnormal traffic behaviors. Technical implementation plan: Taking Zabbix as an example, the main steps of its implementation are as follows: 1. Install Zabbix Server and Agent Install Zabbix Server on the monitoring host, set up the database and Web server, and install Zabbix Agent on the remote host that needs to be monitored ( If you need to monitor the performance of the system, you need to install Zabbix Agent). 2. Configure hosts and monitoring items Add hosts to be monitored in Zabbix and configure monitoring items and triggers to be monitored. For example, if the monitoring item of CPU usage is set, an alarm message will be triggered when the CPU usage exceeds 80%. 3. Set the alarm and notification method. When an abnormal situation is monitored, it is necessary to issue an alarm in time and notify the relevant personnel. Zabbix supports a variety of alarm and notification methods, such as SMS, email, WeChat, etc. 4. Setting graphs and reports Through Zabbix's graph report function, the monitoring data can be displayed and analyzed in various forms such as line graphs and histograms. To sum up, through the monitoring system, real-time monitoring and visual display of network performance can be realized. There are many implementation schemes, and the appropriate scheme can be selected according to the specific situation.
