### Bitsadmin: Clearing the Peer List

**Applies to: Windows Server (All supported versions)**

The `bitsadmin /peers /clear` command is used to clear the list of peer computers that are used for file transfers in the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS).

#### Syntax
```plaintext
bitsadmin /peers /clear
```

#### Example
To clear the peer list, use the following command:
```plaintext
bitsadmin /peers /clear
```

This command will remove all entries from the peer list, ensuring that BITS will no longer use those peers for future file transfers.
