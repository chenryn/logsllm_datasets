User: How to use GitLab to host code, and perform version control and collaborative development?
Assistant: To host code on GitLab and perform version control and collaborative development, you need to complete the following steps: 1. Create a project on GitLab: Log in to your GitLab account, click the "New Project" button, and follow the instructions to create a new project. 2. Clone the project: Open a terminal window, enter the folder where you want to store the code, and run the clone project command, for example: git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git. 3. Add, modify, and commit code: After changing the code locally, use git add . to add files, and use the git commit -m "commit message" command to commit the changes to the local branch. 4. Push the code: Use the git push origin master command to push the changes to the GitLab server. 5. Create a branch: When multiple people collaborate on development, it is a wise choice to create a branch for each developer to prevent code conflicts. Use the git branch branchname command to create a branch, then use git checkout branchname to work in the new branch. 6. Merge the branch: Use the git merge branchname command to merge the changes in the branch into the trunk branch. 7. Resolving conflicts: When multiple people collaborate on development, code conflicts may occur. Use the git fetch command to download remote code, and use git merge or rebase to resolve conflicts. 8. Merge request: When you have completed a piece of code and are ready to merge into the main branch, you can open a merge request on GitLab, wait for review and merge into the main branch. These steps will help you host your code on GitLab and enable version control and collaborative development.
