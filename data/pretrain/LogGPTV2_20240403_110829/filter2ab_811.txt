**ATT&CK ID:** T1649  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates

Adversaries may steal or forge authentication certificates to gain unauthorized access to remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are commonly used for signing and encrypting messages and files, as well as for authentication purposes. For instance, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates are linked to specific identities and can serve as credentials for domain accounts. By compromising these certificates, attackers can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security controls.
