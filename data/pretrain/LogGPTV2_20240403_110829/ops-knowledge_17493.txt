Question: Consider a scenario where a Mac with Apple silicon is being secured through various policies and constraints. Which of the following statements accurately reflect the roles and properties of the LocalPolicy and RemotePolicy in ensuring the integrity of the secure boot process and policy management?
"A": "The LocalPolicy restricts the boot environment of recoveryOS to only behave as if it's booting with Full Security, leveraging the RemotePolicy constraints.",
"B": "The RemotePolicy Nonce Hash (rpnh) is subject to change only when actions such as software updates or user-initiated security settings changes occur.",
"C": "LocalPolicy for system recoveryOS includes a recoveryOS Nonce Hash (ronh), which allows for the booting of the system recoveryOS even when operating systems are disabled via Find My.",
"D": "LocalPolicy and RemotePolicy utilize the same nonce hash for all policies, ensuring uniformity and simplification of the secure boot process."
