### Clustering Complexity and Scalability

The clustering component of the Fingerprint Extractor has a computational complexity of \(O(n^2 \cdot \log^2(n))\). To enhance scalability for large-scale classification, several improvements can be made:

- **Parallel Computation of Pairwise PCE Correlations:** The construction of the PCE correlation matrix can be accelerated by computing pairwise PCE correlations in parallel.
- **Parallel Pipeline Execution:** As the number of images \(n\) approaches infinity, the entire pipeline can be executed in parallel on subsets of the \(n\) images. A final instance of the Fingerprint Extractor can then be used to agglomerate the clusters obtained from these parallelized processes.
- **Leveraging Distributed/Parallel Hierarchical Clustering:** Prior work on distributed and parallel hierarchical clustering [56, 62, 66] can be utilized to further improve efficiency.

### Experimental Setup

#### 4.1 Real and Fake Image Datasets

For each dataset, we detail the GAN used to generate the fake images in the test set and the collection method for real images in both the test and reference sets. Each dataset contains 2,500 fake images, and 2,000 random real images are selected to build the reference set. Table 1 summarizes the 11 datasets, covering 4 GAN models, used in our evaluation. Image samples from all datasets are provided in Figures 8-18 in Appendix A.

#### 4.2 Configuration of NoiseScope

- **Noise Residual Extractor:** We use a Wavelet Denoising filter to prepare residual images, implemented using Goljan et al.'s method.
- **Fingerprint Extractor:**
  - **Parameters:**
    - \(T_{\text{merge}}\): PCE correlation threshold for merging two clusters.
    - \(T_{\text{size}}\): Early stopping threshold for the clustering process, set to 150.
  - **Estimating \(T_{\text{merge}}\):** We compute 'pseudo-fingerprints' over random subsets of 20 images and set \(T_{\text{merge}}\) to the 99.5th percentile of the PCE correlation distribution between these pseudo-fingerprints.
- **Fingerprint Classifier:**
  - **Configuration:**
    - LOF anomaly detection scheme trained using 200 pseudo-fingerprints computed from random subsets of 50 real images.
    - Parameters: contamination = \(10^{-4}\), number of neighbors = 30.
- **Fake Image Detector:**
  - Flags an image as fake if the PCE correlation between a model fingerprint and the residual image exceeds a threshold, calibrated such that 99.5% of the reference set images are not flagged as fake.

#### 4.3 Evaluation Metrics and Baseline Method

- **Metrics:** Average F1 score, calculated as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall of the fake class, over 5 random trials.
- **Baseline Method:** CSD-SVM [45], which uses features from HSV and YCbCr color spaces to train a one-class SVM for anomaly detection. We use a Gaussian kernel and grid search for parameter estimation, with ν values of 0.10 and 0.05.

### Evaluation of Proposed Scheme

#### 5.1 Analysis of Model Fingerprints

- **Performance of Fingerprint Classifier:**
  - For the three face datasets (StyleGAN-Face1, StyleGAN-Face2, PGGAN-Face), the classifier achieves an average F1 score of 99.2% over 5 trials.
  - When camera identifiers are not available, we use the strategy described in Section 4.2, which works well in practice.

- **Understanding Model Fingerprints:**
  - GAN fingerprints often show checkerboard patterns due to deconvolution layers in GAN generators [65].
  - An experiment with CycleGAN shows that varying the kernel size in transpose convolutional layers can alter the intensity and locality of the checkerboard pattern in the resulting fingerprint.

#### 5.2 Detection Performance

- **Balanced Test Sets:**
  - NoiseScope is applied to balanced test sets with 500 real and 500 fake images.
  - Table 2 presents the detection performance (average F1 score) for both NoiseScope and CSD-SVM (ν=0.1).
  - NoiseScope outperforms CSD-SVM across all 11 datasets, achieving an F1 score of over 90.1% for all datasets.

**Table 2: Detection performance (average F1 score) for NoiseScope and CSD-SVM.**

| Datasets            | NoiseScope F1 Score | CSD-SVM F1 Score (ν=0.1) |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| StyleGAN-Face1      | 90.1%               | 75.0%                    |
| StyleGAN-Face2      | 92.0%               | 70.0%                    |
| StyleGAN-Bed        | 91.5%               | 72.0%                    |
| BigGAN-DogLV        | 93.0%               | 73.0%                    |
| ...                 | ...                 | ...                      |

Given NoiseScope's high detection performance, it is noteworthy that images generated by StyleGAN, PGGAN, and BigGAN are vividly photorealistic and challenging for humans to identify.
