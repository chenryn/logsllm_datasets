  * Operating system: Windows 8.1
I am working on a project to test some code in a sandboxed iframe that gives
limited access to the parent. The implementation is pretty straight forward.
The problem is it works in modern web browsers but not in Electron. It is even
verified working in Chrome. And both the jQuery and vanilla JS versions
produce the same results.
The iframe is created with:
    $('', {
        src: 'about:blank',
        id:  'ptg-sandbox',
        frameborder: 0,
        scrolling: 'no',
        style: 'width: 0px; height: 0px; display: none;'
    }).appendTo('body');
And then the eval works much like:
    $('#ptg-sandbox')[0].contentWindow.eval('alert("test");');
Code is in place to ensure the iframe exists in the DOM before firing the
code. So I ruled that out. The expected result should be an alert that says
"test". But unfortunately I can't get it and no error is returned. If it helps
to know I am also have nodeIntegration set to false for this BrowserWindow.
