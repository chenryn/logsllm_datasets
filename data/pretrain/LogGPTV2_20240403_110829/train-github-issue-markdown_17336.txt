 **I'm submitting a bug report**
**Webpack version:**  
2.1.0-beta.23
**Please tell us about your environment:**  
OSX
**Current behavior:**
    Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
     - configuration.entry['something'] should be one of these:
       string | [string]
       The entry point for one output file
**Expected/desired behavior:**  
Should work since I am actually passing an array of strings as entry point(s)
