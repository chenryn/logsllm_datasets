### Bug Report

**Webpack Version:**
2.1.0-beta.23

**Environment:**
- Operating System: macOS (OSX)

**Current Behavior:**
When initializing Webpack, I encounter the following error:
```
Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialized using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
- configuration.entry['something'] should be one of these:
  - string
  - [string]
  The entry point for one output file
```

**Expected/Desired Behavior:**
The configuration should work as expected, since I am passing an array of strings as the entry point(s).
