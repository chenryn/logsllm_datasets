the ﬁrst server failure and when the server recovers, for all servers
that failed and recovered during our two-week period (again, ignor-
ing the 5% with the highest values). We observe that the majority
of failures last less than 5 hours. Considering that we are ignoring
failures that we could not determine lasted more than 20 minutes,
that fraction is likely to be larger. Less than 7% of the observed
failures last longer than 1 day. Hence, recovery times are likely
to be on the order of hours, and very unlikely to last more than 2
days. Again, ADNS servers have slightly shorter recovery times
than LDNS servers.
Figure 13: LDNS Arrival Rate: This ﬁgure shows the number
of unique LDNS IPs that accessed a portion of Akamai (upper
curve), and the estimated number of unique non-dynamic IPs
that accessed Akamai (lower curve) during a one-week period
on a subset of Akamai nodes (using ldns-all). The overlaid
dashed lines approximates the arrival rate of new IPs after 1.5
days.
4.4 Dynamic IP LDNS Arrival Rate
We now revisit the LDNS servers that we believe may be behind
dynamic IP addresses. In particular, based on reverse DNS lookups
and by cross-checking IPs with a spam RBL database, we noticed
that a fair number of LDNS servers appear to be on DSL or di-
alup links. Due to the transient nature of machines behind dynamic
IP addresses, we cannot derive much about them from our active
probes. Instead we attempt to infer their attributes by characteriz-
ing their time of appearance at Akamai.
Figure 13 shows the arrival rate of new unique IP addresses to the
subset of Akamai regions for which we collected logs. After 1.5 or
2 days, it appears that the rate of new arrivals becomes roughly
linear. Measurements of LDNS servers accessing the root name-
servers have also exhibited this pattern [8]. It is highly unlikely that
a large number of new LDNS servers are continually being added
to the DNS system, so we suspect the majority of these arrivals are
from DNS servers that change their IP addresses. We also plot the
arrival rate of LDNS servers that we conservatively classify as non-
dynamic (using the ﬁrst two heuristics described in Section 3.3).
We used linear regression to ﬁt lines to the new arrivals after 1.5
days, which is shown as the dashed and dotted lines in the ﬁgure.
The the total arrival rate line has a slope of 51,666, while the slope
of non-dynamic arrival rate line has a slope of 6,572 (a factor of
8 smaller!), suggesting that the arrival rate of new dynamic IPs to
this subset of Akamai regions is roughly 31 per minute. Since this
subset is composed of roughly one eighth of Akamai’s regions, the
global arrival rate of LDNS servers on dynamic IPs may be much
higher.
This arrival rate is an overestimate, since our non-dynamic clas-
siﬁcation heuristics are conservative (observe that if most servers
that appear during the ﬁrst 1.5 days are using non-dynamic IPs,
then our estimate may be off by a factor of 4). However, arrival
rates differ by a factor of 8, so we can still conclude that the the
actual arrival rate of new dynamic IPs is still very high (though
eventually the dynamic IP pools will be exhausted). Unless explic-
itly guarded against, future federated services may have to manage
these “servers” in addition to the aliasing effects of dynamic IPs.
The LDNS deployment model allows anyone to establish their own
local nameserver, and it appears that “anyone” will, whether inten-
tionally or not.
4.5 Deployment Styles
We conclude our measurement results by providing a prelimi-
nary examination of how particular organizations deploy and con-
ﬁgure their various DNS servers to respond to local queries – i.e.,
how many DNS servers do they deploy and how the load distributed
across these servers. We refer to this as the LDNS deployment style.
For example, some organizations may just deploy a single local
DNS server to answer all local queries. Other organizations could
deploy a collection of local DNS servers each serving a fraction
of the request volume. For this analysis, we used a trace of DNS
requests made to 80% of active Akamai servers during one day in
December 2003, similar to that used to derive ldns-load (the
larger coverage of Akamai sites in this trace allows us to obtain a
more complete view of organizations that access Akamai).

Relative load
Figure 15: Deployment examples: A CDF of the relative load
on LDNS servers (i.e., number of requests made by the server)
for three different organizations. The x-axis is in log-scale. The
number of LDNS servers in A1.edu, B1.net and C1.com are 84,
1710 and 27, respectively.
Figure 14 shows a CDF of the number of LDNS servers we ob-
served in all organizations. Although most organizations appear to
have only a single LDNS server deployed, .edu organizations are
clearly more likely to have multiple servers. However, .net organi-
zations, which are typically ISPs, are the most likely to have a very
large number of LDNS servers (more than 50). Note that we can
not distinguish multiple LDNS servers behind a ﬁrewall or NAT de-
vice; this limitation may contribute to the smaller number of LDNS
servers observed in .com organizations, since presumably they are
more likely to employ such devices.
Figure 15 shows the relative load distributions across LDNS
servers (including dynamic ones) in three different organizations,
a .com, a .net, and a .edu. We use the domain name of an LDNS
to identify the organization that it “belongs to”. For a .edu (uni-
versities) or .com (enterprises) site, this approach will only iden-
tify LDNS servers that are deployed and maintained by the site.
However, this does not hold true for .net organizations, which
are typically ISPs and backbone carriers. For example, an LDNS
server dynip-1-2-3-4.B1.net will be classiﬁed as “belong-
ing” to B1.net, while it probably belongs to a small customer of
B1.net. In the case of .net organizations, therefore, our approach
identiﬁes nameservers whose trafﬁc is carried by the ISP and which
are still dependent on the ISP for connectivity and persistent avail-
ability.
As Figure 15 shows, a large number of LDNS servers in B1.net
generate very few requests (80% of servers generate less than 100
requests to Akamai during the course of the day). Also, a very small
fraction of LDNSs generate a large number of requests (2% of
LDNSs each generate 100,000 requests to Akamai during the day).
At the other extreme, a much smaller fraction of LDNS servers in
C1.com are lightly loaded (only about 15% of LDNS servers gen-
erate less than 100 requests to Akamai each). Also, there exist a
few servers that generate intermediate and very high request vol-
umes. Finally, the curve for servers in A1.edu is in between these
two extremes with a much wider variety of relative loads across the
servers.
In Figure 16, we show other examples of relative LDNS loads for
well known .edu (Figure 16(a)), .net (Figure 16(b)) and .com (Fig-
ure 16(c)) sites. Notice that, with the exception of A2.edu, all
.edu sites in Figure 16(a) roughly follow the same trend as A1.edu
in Figure 15. A2.edu likely shows different behavior because it
shares DNS servers with a local ISP. The trend among the differ-
ent .net sites (Figure 16(b)) is again similar to that of B1.net in
Figure 15. However we do not observe as clear a common pat-
tern among the different .com sites (Figure 16(c)). For example,
while C2.com and C1.com have similar characteristics, C3.com
is more similar to the style we observe for .edu sites.
In general, the load distribution among an organization’s de-
ployed LDNS servers seems to belong to one of three broad va-
rieties as we show in Figure 15. In the future, we plan to further
investigate the underlying trade-offs that lead to these classes of
deployment.
4.6 Summary of Measurements
What conclusions can we draw from our observations about DNS
server characteristics? First, we conclude that the majority of users
are likely to be using only a small number of the LDNS servers
deployed. The majority of DNS requests sent over the wide area are
for a small number of ADNS servers. These results imply that the
distribution of user populations behind particular servers in DNS is
highly skewed.
Second, we observe from our results that the majority of both
LDNS and ADNS servers are highly available: most were always
available during our two week observation. For those that had un-
availability periods, time to failure typically lasted days, weeks, or
longer, and recovery times typically lasted less than a few hours.
A non-trivial fraction had “one 9” or less of availability, but with
replication at independent points in the network, we believe DNS
service is almost always available. Moreover, servers that are used

Figure 16: DNS server deployment styles: The ﬁgures show the CDF of the relative load on LDNS servers (i.e., number of requests
made by the server) for three different types of organizations: .edu sites (universities, (a)), .net sites (Internet service providers and
backbone carriers, (b)) and .com sites (commercial enterprises, (c)).
more frequently are more likely to be available for a larger fraction
of time. Although the correlation between frequency of use and
availability is probably not large enough to make predictive esti-
mates, it does bode well considering the signiﬁcant skew in usage
across nameservers.
Third, we ﬁnd that there is signiﬁcant diversity in deployment
styles within different organizations. Some organizations, such
as ISPs, are comprised of both very highly used and very lightly
used nameservers, while others, such as commercial enterprises,
only have several medium and highly used servers. The deploy-
ment style may reﬂect the departmentalization within organiza-
tional boundaries or load balancing among multiple servers.
Finally, we make the observation that LDNS servers have much
more diversity in their attributes than ADNS servers. For example,
we found that about 2% of the LDNS servers that had less than per-
fect availability exhibited diurnal patterns of availability and that a
