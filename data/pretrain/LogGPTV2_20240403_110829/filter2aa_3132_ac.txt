Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
• CMB radiation is the leftover heat from the hot early universe,
which last scattered about 400,000 years after the Big Bang.
• CMB permeates the entire universe at a temperature of 2.725
± 0.001K.
• CMB was predicted in the 1940’s by Ralph Alpher, George
Gamow and Robert Herman.
• Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally discovered CMB
while working for Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1965.
• The intensity is measured in Mega Jansky (Jy) per steradian.
1Jy = 10−26W/m2/Hz
Close examination of slight CMB intensity
variations in diﬀerent parts of the sky help
cosmologists study the formation of galaxies.

The Electromagnetic Radiation Spectrum
How to read this chart
• This chart is organized in octaves (frequency doubling/halving) starting at 1Hz and
going higher (2,4,8, etc) and lower (1/2, 1/4, etc). The octave is a natural way to
represent frequency.
• Frequency increases on the vertical scale in the upward direction.
• The horizontal bars wrap around from far right to far left as the frequency increases
upwards.
• There is no limit to either end of this chart, however, due to limited space, only the
“known” items have been shown here. A frequency of 0Hz is the lowest possible
frequency but the method of depicting octaves used here does not allow for ever
reaching 0Hz, only approaching it. Also, by the deﬁnition of frequency (Cycles per
second), there is no such thing as negative frequency.
• Values on the chart have been labelled with the following colours: Frequency meas-
ured in Hertz, Wavelength measured in meters, Energy measured in electronVolts.
Ultraviolet Light
• Ultraviolet light is beyond the range of human vision.
• Physicists have divided ultraviolet light ranges into Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV), Ex-
treme Ultraviolet (EUV), Far Ultraviolet (FUV), Medium Ultraviolet (MUV), and
Near Ultraviolet (NUV).
• UV-A, UV-B and UV-C were introduced in the 1930’s by the Commission Interna-
tionale de l’´Eclairage (CIE, International Commission on Illumination) for photobio-
logical spectral bands.
• Short-term UV-A exposure causes sun-tanning which helps to protect against sun-
burn. Exposure to UV-B is beneﬁcial to humans by helping the skin produce vitamin
D. Excessive UV exposure causes skin damage. UV-C is harmful to humans but is
used as a germicide.
• The CIE originally divided UVA and UVB at 315nm, later some photo-dermatologists
divided it at 320nm.
• UVA is subdivided into UVA1 and UVA2 for DNA altering eﬀects at 340nm.
• The sun produces a wide range of frequencies including all the ultraviolet light,
however, UVB is partially ﬁltered by the ozone layer and UVC is totally ﬁltered out
by the earth’s atmosphere.
• A bumblebee can see light in the UVA range which helps them identify certain
ﬂowers.
Emission and Absorption
• As EMR passes through elements, certain wavelength bands get absorbed and some
new ones get emitted. This absorption and emission produces characteristic spectral
lines for each element which are useful in determining the makeup of distant stars.
These lines are used to prove the red-shift amount of distant stars.
• When a photon hits an atom it may be absorbed if the energy is just right. The
energy level of the electron is raised – essentially holding the radiation. A new photon
of speciﬁc wavelength is created when the energy is released. The jump in energy is
a discrete step and many possible levels of energy exist in an atom.
• Johann Balmer created this formula deﬁning the photon emission wavelength (λ);
where m is the initial electron energy level and n is the ﬁnal electron energy level:
λ = 364.56nm
m2
m2 − n2
• Much of the interstellar matter is made of the simplest atom hydrogen. The hydrogen

Television
• Television is transmitted in the VHF and UHF ranges (30MHz - 3GHz).
• TV channels transmitted over the air are shown as TV .
• TV channels transmitted through cable (CATV) are shown as TV . CATV channels
starting with “T-” are channels fed back to the cable TV station (like news feeds).
• Air and cable TV stations are broadcast with the separate video, colour, and audio
frequency carriers grouped together in a channel band as follows:

• Satellite channels broadcast in the C-Band are depicted as TV . These stations are
broadcast in alternating polarities (Ex. Ch 1 is vertical and 2 is horizontal and vice
versa on neighbouring satellites).
• The 15.7 kHz horizontal sweep signal produced by a TV can be heard by some young
people. This common contaminant signal to VLF spectra listening is depicted as
.
Radio Bands
• The radio spectrum (ELF to EHF) is populated by many more items than can be
shown on this chart, only a small sampling of bands used around the world have
been shown.
• Communication using EMR is done using either:
– Amplitude Modulation (AM)
OR
– Frequency Modulation (FM)
• Each country has its own rules and regulations for allotting bands in this region.
For more information, look up the radio communications authority in your area (Ex.
FCC in the US, DOC in Canada).
• Not all references agree on the ULF band range, the HAARP range is used here.
• RAdio Detecting And Ranging (RADAR) uses EMR in the microwave range to detect
the distance and speed of objects.
• Citizens Band Radio (CB) contains 40 stations between 26.965-27.405MHz.
• Schumann resonance is produced in the cavity between the Earth and the ionosphere.
The resonant peaks are depicted as S
• Hydrogen gas emits radio band EMR at 21cm H

Sound
• Although sound, ocean waves, and heartbeats are not electromag-
netic, they are included on this chart as a frequency reference. Other
properties of electromagnetic waves are diﬀerent from sound waves.
• Sound waves are caused by an oscillating compression of molecules.
Sound cannot travel in a vacuum such as outer space.
• The speed of sound in air at sea level is 1240kph (770mph).
• Humans can only hear sound between ≈20Hz to ≈20kHz.
• Infrasound (below 20Hz) can be sensed by internal organs and touch.
Frequencies in the 0.2Hz range are often the cause of motion sickness.
• Bats can hear sound up to ≈50kHz.
• The 88 piano keys of the Equal Temperament scale are accurately
located on the frequency chart.
• Over the ages people have striven to divide the continuous audio fre-
quency spectrum into individual musical notes that have harmonious
relationships. Microtonal musicians study various scales. One recent
count lists 4700 diﬀerent musical scales.
• The musical note A is depicted on the chart as

Gravity Waves
• Gravity is the mysterious force that holds large objects together and
binds our planets, stars, and galaxies together. Many people have
unsuccessfully theorized about the details of gravity and its relation-
ship to other forces. There have been no links between gravity waves
and electromagnetic radiation.
• Gravity is theorized to warp space and time. In fact, gravity is re-
sponsible for bending light as observed by the gravity-lens example of
distant galaxies.
• “Gravity waves” would appear as ripples in space-time formed by large
objects moving through space that might possibly be detected in the
future by very sensitive instruments.
• The speed that gravity propagates through space has been theorized
to be the same as the speed of light.
Brain Waves
• By connecting electrodes from the human head to an electroen-
cephalograph (EEG), it is possible to measure very small cyclic elec-
trical signals.
• There has been much study on this topic, but like all eﬀects on
humans, the ﬁndings are not as sound as the science of materials.
• Generally, lower brain wave frequencies relate to sleep, and the higher
frequencies relate to alertness.
• Devices have been made for measuring and stimulating brain waves
to achieve a desired state.
Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)
• EMR is emitted in discrete units called photons but has properties
of waves as seen by the images below. EMR can be created by the
oscillation or acceleration of electrical charge or magnetic ﬁeld. EMR
travels through space at the speed of light (2.997 924 58 ×108 m/s).
EMR consists of an oscillating electrical and magnetic ﬁeld which are
at right angles to each other and spaced at a particular wavelength.
There is some controversy about the phase relationship between the
electrical and magnetic ﬁelds of EMR, one of the theoretical repre-
sentations is shown here:

Particle Nature
• The particle nature of EMR is exhibited when a solar cell emits indi-
vidual electrons when struck with very dim light.
• The wave nature of EMR is demonstrated by the famous double slit
experiment that shows cancelling and addition of waves.
• Much of the EMR properties are based on theories since we can only
see the eﬀects of EMR and not the actual photon or wave itself.
• Albert Einstein theorized that the speed of light is the fastest that
anything can travel. So far he has not been proven wrong.
• EMR can have its wavelength changed if the source is receding or
approaching as in the red-shift example of distant galaxies and stars
that are moving away from us at very high speeds.
The emitted
spectral light from these receding bodies appears more red than it
would be if the object was not moving away from us.
• We only have full electronic control over frequencies in the microwave
range and lower. Higher frequencies must be created by waiting for
the energy to be released from elements as photons. We can either
pump energy into the elements (ex. heating a rock with visible EMR
and letting it release infrared EMR) or let it naturally escape (ex.
uranium decay).
• We can only see the visible spectrum. All other bands of the spectrum
are depicted as hatched colours

Gamma Rays
• Gamma radiation is the highest energy radiation (up to ≈ 1020 eV)
that has been measured. At this energy, the radiation could be from
gamma-rays, protons, electrons, or something else.
• Alpha, beta, and delta radiation are not electromagnetic but are ac-
tually parts of the atom being released from a radioactive element.
In some cases this can cause gamma radiation. These are not to be
confused with brain waves of similar names.
Visible Spectrum
• The range of EMR visible to humans is called “Light”. The visible
spectrum also closely resembles the range of EMR that ﬁlters through
our atmosphere from the sun.
• Other creatures see diﬀerent ranges of visible light; for example
bumble-bees can see ultraviolet light and dogs have a diﬀerent re-
sponse to colours than do humans.
• The sky is blue because our atmosphere scatters light and the shorter
wavelength blue gets scattered the most. It appears that the entire
sky is illuminated by a blue light but in fact that light is scattered from
the sun. The longer wavelengths like red and orange move straight
through the atmosphere which makes the sun look like a bright white
ball containing all the colours of the visible spectrum.
• Interestingly, the visible spectrum covers approximately one octave.
• Astronomers use ﬁlters to capture speciﬁc wavelengths and reject
unwanted wavelengths. The major astronomical (visual) ﬁlter bands
are depicted as
X
Infrared Radiation
• Infrared radiation (IR) is sensed by humans as heat and is below the
range of human vision. Humans (and anything at room temperature)
are emitters of IR.
• IR remote control signals are invisible to the human eye but can be
detected by most camcorders.
• Night vision scopes/goggles use a special camera that senses IR and
converts the image to visible light. Some IR cameras employ an IR
lamp to help illuminate the view.
• IR LASERs are used for burning objects.
• A demonstration of IR is to hold a metal bowl in front of your face.
The IR emitted by your body will be reﬂected back using the parabolic
shape of the bowl and you will feel the heat.
• Fiber-optic based infrared communication signals are sometimes am-
pliﬁed with Erbium-Doped Fiber Ampliﬁers EDFA
LASER
• LASER is an acronym for Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission
of Radiation.
• A LASER is a device that produces monochromatic EMR of high
intensity.
• With proper equipment, any EMR can be made to operate like a
LASER. For example, microwaves are used to create a MASER.
Polarization
• As a photon (light particle) travels through space, its axis of electrical
and magnetic ﬂuctuations does not rotate. Therefore, each photon
has a ﬁxed linear polarity of somewhere between 0◦ to 360◦. Light
can also be circularly and elliptically polarized.
• Some crystals can cause the photon to rotate its polarization.
• Receivers that expect polarized photons will not accept photons that
are in other polarities. (ex. satellite dish receivers have horizontal and
vertical polarity positions).
• A polarized ﬁlter (like PolaroidTM sunglasses) can be used to demon-
strate polarized light. One ﬁlter will only let photons that have one
polarity through. Two overlapping ﬁlters at right angles will almost
completely block the light that exits; however, a third ﬁlter inserted
between the ﬁrst two at a 45◦ angle will rotate the polarized light
and allow some light to come out the end of all three ﬁlters.
• Light that reﬂects oﬀ an electrical insulator becomes polarized. Con-
ductive reﬂectors do not polarize light.
• Perhaps the most reliably polarized light is a rainbow.
• Moonlight is also slightly polarized. You can test this by viewing the
moonlight through a PolaroidTMsunglass lens, then rotate that lens,
the moonlight will dim and brighten slightly.
Refraction
• Refraction of EMR is dependent on wavelength as can be seen by the
prism example below.
By using a glass prism, white light
can be spread by refraction into a
spectrum of its composite colours.
All wavelengths of EMR can be re-
fracted by using the proper ma-
terials.
Not all glass prisms be-
have alike; a right-angle prism will
act as a mirror instead of a light
refractor. The critical angle of a
true light-refracting prism is 42◦.

Reﬂection
• Reﬂection of EMR is dependent on wavelength as demonstrated when
visible light and radio waves bounce oﬀ objects that X-Rays would
pass through. Microwaves, which have a large wavelength compared
to visible light, will bounce oﬀ metal mesh in a microwave oven
whereas visible light will pass through.

Reﬂector
EMR of any wavelength can be re-
ﬂected, however, the reﬂectivity of
a material depends on many fac-
tors including the wavelength of
the incident beam.
The angle of incidence (θi) and
angle of reﬂection (θr) are the
same.
