User: I need to set my process to run under 'nobody', I've found os.setuid(), but how do I find uid if I have login?
I've found out that uids are in /etc/passwd, but maybe there is a more pythonic way than scanning /etc/passwd. Anybody?
Assistant: Never directly scan /etc/passwd.
For instance, on a Linux system I administer, the user accounts are not on /etc/passwd, but on a LDAP server.
The correct way is to use getpwent/getgrent and related C functions (as in @TFKyle's answer), which will get the information on the correct way for each system (on Linux glibc, it reads /etc/nsswitch.conf to know which NSS dynamic libraries to load to get the information).
