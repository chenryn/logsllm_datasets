title:blackhat:us-21 Can You Roll Your Own SIEM?
At Two Sigma, we had sunk over $1 million in licensing for a popular third-party SIEM product and were paying an additional $200,000 in annual maintenance. We were limited on what data sources we could leverage as our license was restricted to a low daily ingestion rate. As our company began to explore cloud transformation broadly, we in Security began investigating competitive options for our event collection and analysis platform. We wanted to know if we could roll our own cloud-native SIEM more efficiently while providing greater access to our data, and be as effective as the vendor's solution.To figure that out, we asked:1. Does the vendor SIEM product cover enough of our threat landscape to make it worth the cost? 2. If not, has our organization made strategic investments in alternate platforms which could be leveraged instead? 3. If yes, does our team have the skills required to implement and mold these platforms to our needs?The answers led us to roll our own SIEM. In our presentation, we'll dig into these questions and decisions in-depth, as well as describe our architecture and several use cases. At the end of the day, we've been running our GCP SIEM for over a year and have moved off the vendor platform. To get started, we wrote less than 6,000 lines of code across a handful of simple tools. We ingest 5TB of data per day and have over 2PB of historical data stored and instantly searchable. In the end, we spent ~$500,000 to build our own SIEM that would have cost us $4 million if we used our third-party vendor. We're also saving an estimated $600,000 year over year in maintenance and subscription fees, plus reducing hardware capital expenditure.
