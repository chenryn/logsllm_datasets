User: I have been trying to use Eclipse 3.6 as a Python editor. 
I install the latest version of PyDev, and then try to set the Interpreter - Python field of the preferences, on my mac.
My python version is 2.6 and the path is "/usr/bin/python". When I enter this, and I select the items to add to the system PYTHONPATH I get the following error message:

Error: Python stdlib not found
It seems that the Python /Lib folder (which contains the standard
  library) was not found /selected during the instal process.
This folder (which contains files such as threading.py and
  traceback.py) is required for PyDev to function properly (and it must
  contain the actual source files, not only .pyc files)  ...

So I can't tell eclipse the interpreter path! 
Any help would be great! 
(I tried reinstalling PyDev already, no luck)
Thanks!
Following Praveen's answer, My python library is in /library/python/2.6/site-packages. When I enter /usr/bin/python into the interpreter field, eclipse asks me which paths I would like to add to my System PYTHONPATH. One of the checkbox items is exactly that path. So I check it, along with the other boxes. Click ok, and I get the same error.
Assistant: I found the solution of not touching macs deliverd python version, but downloading ad installing a new one (currently 3.something) 
when setting up the interpreter, point to /usr/local/bin/pyhton3
(to find out the exact path open terminal and type: sudo -s !hittenter> your password  !hittenter>   cd /usr/local/bin  !hittenter>  ls  !hittenter>)
-> what this does is, showing you the content of the folder you went to. you should find the python interpreter in there.
WARNING!!!!
Do not touch or change any other python files/folders delivered with your mac.
