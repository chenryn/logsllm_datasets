User: When I type python into the command line, the command prompt says python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file. What should I do?
Note: I have Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed on my computer.
Assistant: I am probably the most novice user here, I have spent six hours just to run python in the command line in Windows 8. Once I installed the 64-bit version, then I uninstalled it and replaced it with 32-bit version. Then, I tried most suggestions here, especially by defining path in the system variables, but still it didn't work. 
Then I realised when I typed in the command line:
echo %path%
The path still was not directed to C:\python27. So I simply restarted the computer, and now it works.
