User: Explain the SMTP and POP3 protocols in the e-mail system and explain their respective roles.
Assistant: SMTP refers to "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol", Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. The SMTP protocol is a protocol for sending emails in an email system. The SMTP client program is responsible for transmitting the email to the server, and the server transmits the email to the specified email box. POP3 refers to "Post Office Protocol version 3", which is the third version of the Post Office Protocol. The POP3 protocol is a protocol for receiving emails in the email system. When an email arrives at the server, the server stores the email and waits for the user to read it. When a user logs in to the server through a POP3 client program, the server transmits the corresponding e-mail to the user's computer and marks it as read. The user can then choose to keep or delete the message. Therefore, the SMTP and POP3 protocols are standard protocols for sending and receiving emails. SMTP delivers the mail you send to the correct server and sends it to the recipient, while the POP3 protocol is responsible for pulling the received mail from the server and waiting for the user to read it.
