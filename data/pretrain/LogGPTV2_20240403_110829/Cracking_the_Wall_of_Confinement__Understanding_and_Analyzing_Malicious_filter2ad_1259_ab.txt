### Identifying and Analyzing Taken-Down Domains

It is challenging to identify taken-down domains, which can introduce noise into our domain list. For example, Microsoft is well-known for its takedown operations targeting botnets that exploit vulnerabilities in their products. Microsoft has successfully taken down five botnets: Dorkbot [9], Ramnit [28], Shylock [33], Citadel [3], and ZeroAccess [35]. In these operations, Microsoft obtained domain and IP seizure orders by suing unnamed defendants (John Does) for violations of federal and state laws, including operating a botnet that harmed Microsoft customers and infringing on trademarks. The court, after examining the provided evidence, issued seizure notices for hundreds of domain names and IP addresses. These notices detailed the specific approach for domain seizure, which involved sinkholing the seized domains by setting their NS records to point to Microsoft’s sinkhole, *.microsoftinternetsafety.net. In these takedown operations, Microsoft acts as both the takedown requester and the sinkhole operator, while the takedown executors are various registries and registrars, based on the TLDs and registration records of the listed domains.

### Threat Model

In our research, we consider an adversary capable of exploiting loopholes in the domain takedown process to regain control of previously taken-down domains. This not only undermines the effectiveness of the takedown process but also opens the door to new attack vectors, such as the exploitation of outdated sinkhole configuration settings.

### Finding Taken-Down Domains

In this section, we detail the design and implementation of the techniques used to identify domains that have been taken down through either sinkholing or delisting. We conducted a measurement study on seized domains using the methodology pipeline shown in Figure 3. We analyzed approximately 1 million malicious domains to identify seized domains and their takedown durations. 

#### Data Collection

Our malicious domain list, denoted as \( DM \), is collected from two sources: possible sinkholed domains (\( DS \)), retrieved using identified sinkhole operators, and blacklisted domains (\( DB \)). To identify taken-down domains (either by sinkholing or delisting) and analyze their lifecycle, we also collected passive DNS (PDNS) and historical WHOIS data for each malicious domain in our list.

**Identifying Sinkhole Operators:**

Our goal was to compile a list of confirmed nameservers/IPs used as sinkholes. We then used this list to collect all domains that historically pointed to them. This list of sinkholes is also utilized in Section III-B.

To gather nameservers and IPs used for sinkholing, we searched the Internet for three types of sinkhole feeds: takedown notices and reports, domain removal lists, and existing sinkhole lists. We manually reviewed published takedown court orders [3, 9, 28, 33, 35] and security reports describing takedown incidents, such as [14, 31, 38], to find sinkhole IPs, sinkhole nameservers, and the malicious domains to be sinkholed. We used PDNS data to check changes in the NS and A records for these sinkholed domains during the report time to identify the responsible nameservers/IPs. Additionally, we used the ZeuS domain removal list, which includes domains no longer posing harm because they have been cleaned or seized [37]. We checked the nameservers/IPs of these sinkholed domains and utilized other sinkhole lists, such as the Emerging Threat rules [11] and other online lists [6, 22].

Before including any sinkholes in our verified list, the following criteria had to be met:
1. The sinkhole must be operated by an identifiable party.
2. The nameserver must be exclusively used for sinkholing.
3. The ownership of the domain used in the nameserver sinkhole did not change due to expiration.

To find undocumented sinkhole nameservers, we performed a reverse WHOIS lookup using a sinkhole operator’s email address. For example, we used a commercial tool [8] to perform a reverse WHOIS lookup on an FBI email (cyd-dns@ic.fbi.gov). This email address was obtained from a WHOIS record of a taken-down domain (444pay.org). The reverse WHOIS lookup returned a list of around 1,700 domains, most of which were seized domains rather than domains hosting sinkholes. To identify domains used as sinkhole nameservers, we used PDNS to retrieve all domains that used one of these possible sinkholes as a nameserver and considered only sinkholes that returned more than 1,000 domains. We randomly sampled the returned domains and checked their names for signs of previous malicious use. This allowed us to confidently determine that the nameserver resolving these domains is a sinkhole. We inferred previous malicious use from the domain name semantics (e.g., containing keywords such as “pills,” “drugs,” etc.) or their affiliation with blacklists. Using this method, we discovered that the FBI uses kratosdns.net as a nameserver to sinkhole malicious domains.

**Total # of Unique Identified Sinkholed Domains: 608,557**

**Collecting Blacklisted Domains:**

We complemented our list of malicious domains with a set of blacklisted domains. Table II contains the eight public blacklists we used, along with their corresponding number of unique domains.

**Table II: Blacklists Used in Our Study**

| Blacklist | # of Unique Domains |
|-----------|---------------------|
| hpHosts | 17 |
| PhishTank | 26 |
| Malware Domain Blocklist | 20 |
| ZeuS Tracker | 36 |
| Malc0de | 19 |
| Conficker | 29 |
| Ransomware Tracker | 2 |
| WayBack Machine | 18 |

For PhishTank, we excluded any domains labeled as ad/tracking (ATS), misleading marketing (MMT), or to be verified label (TBV), as we are only interested in malicious domains. Some blacklists do not provide historical data, so we used the WayBack Machine [18] to crawl any available snapshots of the domains on these lists. The unique apex domains extracted from the blacklists are denoted as \( DB \), with a total of 465,942 domains.

### Combining Data

We combined the list of possible sinkholed domains (\( DS \)) and the blacklisted domains (\( DB \)) to form the final list of malicious domains (\( DM \)). This list served as the basis for identifying and analyzing taken-down domains using PDNS and historical WHOIS data, as discussed in Sections III-B and III-C. As a result, we found 625,692 seized domains and profiled their takedown durations.
