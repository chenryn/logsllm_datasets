and it is not clear how to identify taken-down domains from
them, and thus will introduce noise to our list of domains.
Example. Microsoft
is renowned for its take-down opera-
tions of botnets exploiting vulnerabilities in their products.
Microsoft has taken down ﬁve botnets, Dorkbot [9], Ram-
nit [28], Shylock [33], Citadel [3], and ZeroAccess [35],
where they obtained domain and IP seizure orders by suing
an unnamed defendant, John Does, for violations of federal
and state laws operating a botnet causing harm to Microsoft
customers, and for trademark infringement. Upon examination
of the provided evidence of the cited violations, the court
issued seizure notices for hundreds of domain names and IP
addresses. These notices detailed the speciﬁcs of the domain
seizure approach, which was to sinkhole the seized domains
by setting their NS records to point
to Microsoft’s sink-
hole, *.microsoftinternetsafety.net. Incidentally,
in these take-down operations, Microsoft is the take-down
requester and the sinkhole operator, while the take-down
executors are a number of registries and registrars, according
to the listed domains’ TLDs and registration records.
B. Threat Model
In our research, we consider an adversary who is capable
of exploiting loopholes in the domain take-down process to
regain control of previously taken-down domains. This not
only renders the domain take-down process less effective
but also opens the door for new attack vectors such as the
exploitation of outdated sinkhole conﬁguration settings.
III. FINDING TAKEN-DOWN DOMAINS
In this section, we elaborate on the design and imple-
mentation of the techniques we use to identify domains that
have been taken down either by sinkholing, or delisting. We
conducted a measurement study on seized domains using the
methodology pipeline as shown in Figure 3. We analyzed
around 1M malicious domains to identify seized domains and
their take-down durations. For this purpose, we ﬁrst collected
a set of malicious domains,
including blacklisted domains
and domains hosted on sinkhole servers. To collect the latter,
we ﬁrst
identiﬁed a set of sinkhole nameservers/IPs from
different sources and then deﬁned a set of criteria to validate
these sinkholes. In addition, we utilized some techniques to
discover new sinkholes, as presented in Section III-A. Then,
3

denotes the union of DB and DS.
we collected domains resolved by these sinkholes to ﬁnd
606,880 domains, which are combined with 465,942 domains
from eight blacklists. Finally, we used passive DNS (PDNS)
and historical WHOIS to identify taken-down domains, as
discussed in Sections III-B and III-C. As a result, we found
625,692 seized domains and proﬁled their take-down durations.
A. Data Collection
Our malicious domain list DM is collected from two
sources: possible sinkholed domains (i.e., DS), which is
retrieved using identiﬁed sinkhole operators, and blacklisted
domains (i.e., DB). To identify taken-down domains (either
by sinkholing or delisting) and to analyze their lifecycle, we
also collected PDNS and historical WHOIS for each malicious
domain in our list.
Identifying sinkhole operators. Our goal here was to compile
a list of conﬁrmed nameservers/IP used as sinkholes. We then
used this list of sinkholes to collect all domains that historically
pointed to them. This list of sinkholes is also utilized in
Section III-B.
To get a list of nameservers and IPs used for sinkholing,
we searched the Internet to collect three types of sinkhole
feeds: take-down notices and reports, domain removal lists, and
existing sinkhole lists. We manually reviewed the published
take-down court orders [3, 9, 28, 33, 35] and security reports
that described take-down incidents, such as [14, 31, 38], to
ﬁnd sinkhole IPs, sinkhole nameservers, and the malicious
domains to be sinkholed. We then used the PDNS data to
check the changes in the NS and A records for these sinkholed
domains during the report time to ﬁnd the nameservers/IPs
responsible for sinkholing them. In addition, we used the ZeuS
domain removal list, which includes a list of domains that
no longer pose harm either because they have been cleaned
or seized [37]. We checked the nameservers/IPs of these
sinkholed domains. We also utilized some sinkhole lists, such
as the Emerging Threat rules [11] and other online lists [6, 22].
Before including any of the sinkholes to our veriﬁed list,
the following criteria had to be satisﬁed: 1) the sinkhole must
be operated by an identiﬁable party, 2) the nameserver is
exclusively used for sinkholing, and 3) the ownership of the
domain used in the nameserver sinkhole did not change due
to expiration.
To ﬁnd undocumented sinkhole nameservers, we also used
a sinkhole operator’s email address to retrieve all domains
related to it (i.e., performing reverse lookup via email). For
example, we used a commercial tool [8] to perform a reverse
WHOIS lookup on an FBI email cyd-dns@ic.fbi.gov.
4
This email address was obtained from a WHOIS record of
a taken-down domain 444pay.org. As a result, the reverse
WHOIS lookup returned a list of around 1,700 domains. Most
were seized domains and not domains that hosted sinkholes.
To identify domains used as sinkhole nameservers, we used
PDNS to retrieve all domains that used one of these possible
sinkholes as a nameserver and considered only sinkholes that
returned more than 1K domains. Next, we randomly sampled
those returned domains and checked their names for signs
of previous malicious use. In this way, we could conﬁdently
determine that the nameserver that resolved this domain is a
sinkhole. We inferred previous malicious use from the domain
name semantics (e.g., containing keywords such as “pills”,
“drugs”, etc.) or their afﬁliations with blacklists. In this way,
we discovered a domain named kratosdns.net, which the FBI
uses as a nameserver to sinkhole malicious domains.
Table I shows the sinkhole operators and their correspond-
ing nameservers/IPs we compiled. These sinkholes belong to
19 sinkhole operators, including a law enforcement agency (the
FBI) or their contractors, technology cooperates (Microsoft),
security companies and working groups, and registrars. We
further utilized the list of veriﬁed sinkholes to collect possible
sinkholed domains. That is, we collected all domains/sub-
domains that happened to point to one of these sinkholes
(i.e., performed reveres lookup). More speciﬁcally, we queried
PDNS to return all domains/subdomains that pointed to any
nameserver/IP used as a sinkhole, denoted as DS. This list
served as the possible sinkholed domains list, which had
606,880 apex domains (i.e., domain name without the host/-
subdomain part).
Collecting blacklisted domains. We complemented our list of
malicious domains with a set of blacklisted domains. Table II
contains the eight public blacklists we used, along with their
corresponding number of unique domains. The blacklists that
provide historical data are: hpHosts [17], PhishTank [26],
and Malware Domain Blocklist [20]. For PhishTank, we ex-
cluded any domains labeled as ad/tracking (ATS), misleading
marketing (MMT), or to be veriﬁed label (TBV), as we are
only interested in malicious domains. Some blacklists do not
provide historical data. These are: ZeuS Tracker [36] and
Malc0de [19]. In order to complement them, we used WayBack
Machine [18] to crawl any available snapshots of the domains
on these lists. We also considered malware blacklists such as
Conﬁcker
[29]. The unique
apex domains extracted from the blacklists is denoted as DB,
with a total of 465,942 domains.
