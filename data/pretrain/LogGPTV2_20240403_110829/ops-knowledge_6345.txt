Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Log Entry:
- Timestamp: June 15, 02:04:59
- Component: sshd (pam_unix)
- Process ID (PID): 20882
- Severity: Authentication Failure
- Details:
  - Logname: [Not Set]
  - User ID (UID): 0
  - Effective User ID (EUID): 0
  - TTY: NODEV (No TTY associated with this session)
  - Remote User: [Not Set]
  - Remote Host: 220.135.151.1.hinet-ip.hinet.net

This format makes the information more readable and organized, making it easier to understand the details of the authentication failure.
