Sometimes it is necessary to strictly update the cache without retrieving the
value first, for example when pre-loading a cache. I've created a patch that
adds a boolean updateOnly flag to the `@Cacheable` annotation that is false by
default. If set to true, the underlying cache is not consulted, but rather the
return value is placed directly in the cache.
