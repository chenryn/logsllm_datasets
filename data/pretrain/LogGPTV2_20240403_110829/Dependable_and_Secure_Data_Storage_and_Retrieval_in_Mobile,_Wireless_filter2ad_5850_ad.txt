# Distributed Data Storage for Mobile, Wireless Networks

## Introduction
This paper introduces a distributed data storage system for mobile, wireless networks based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm. The system supports the creation and sharing of files under a read-only model, ensuring both data confidentiality and dependability through the use of Redundant Residue Number Systems (RRNS).

## Case Studies

### Case 3: Two Corrupted Values
In this scenario, user \( u_j \) receives two corrupted values, \( x_{1,2} = 1 \) and \( x_{1,3} = 7 \), instead of the correct residues \( x_{1,2} = 2 \) and \( x_{1,3} = 14 \). Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to decode the residues \( (x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}, x_{1,4}, x_{1,5}, x_{1,6}) \) yields the illegitimate number 9242941, indicating that an error has been detected.

As shown in Table 3, decoding any possible 5-tuple of the received residues results in an illegitimate number, confirming that the error multiplicity exceeds the error-correcting capability of the given RRNS, and the record cannot be reconstructed. However, decoding the 4-tuples \( (x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}, x_{1,4}) \) and \( (x_{1,1}, x_{1,2}, x_{1,4}, x_{1,5}, x_{1,6}) \) yields 18061 and 16997, respectively, which are both legitimate. Thus, \( u_j \) cannot discriminate between these two values.

### Case 4: Single Erasure and One Corrupted Value
In this case, \( u_j \) fails to receive \( x_{1,1} \) and receives the corrupted residue digit \( x_{1,3} = 13 \) instead of the correct residue \( x_{1,3} = 14 \). According to theorems 1 and 2, the RRNS can detect but not correct a single error combined with one erasure. Decoding \( (x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}, x_{1,4}, x_{1,5}, x_{1,6}) \) yields 3058517, an illegitimate number, confirming the error detection.

Decoding the 4-tuples \( (x_{1,2}, x_{1,3}, x_{1,4}, x_{1,5}, x_{1,6}) \) and \( (x_{1,2}, x_{1,4}, x_{1,5}, x_{1,6}) \) yields 16997 and 42343, respectively, both of which are legitimate. Therefore, \( u_j \) cannot distinguish between these two values, and the error cannot be corrected.

## Discussion and Conclusions
We have introduced a distributed data storage system for mobile, wireless networks based on a P2P paradigm. This system supports the creation and sharing of files under a read-only model, ensuring data confidentiality and dependability by encoding files using an RRNS. Specifically, files are partitioned into records, and each record is encoded separately as \((h+r)\)-tuples of data residues using \( h+r \) moduli. The residues are then distributed among the mobiles in the network.

Dependability is ensured as data can be reconstructed in the presence of up to \( s \leq r \) residue erasures, combined with up to \( \left\lfloor \frac{r-s}{2} \right\rfloor \) corrupted residues. Data confidentiality is maintained because recovering the original information requires knowledge of the entire set of moduli.

The achievable degrees of dependability and security are determined by the choice of the RRNS (i.e., the set of moduli). The set of moduli also determines the storage overhead. For files partitioned into records of \( b \) bits, and with moduli \( m_1, \ldots, m_{h+r} \), each record is encoded into \( h+r \) residue digits, accounting for \( \sum_{p=1}^{h+r} \lceil \log_2 m_p \rceil \) bits. Given \( M = m_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot m_h > 2^b \) and \( m_p > m_{p-1} \) for each \( p \in [2, h+r] \), storage efficiency is improved if the moduli (which must be pairwise prime) are as close to each other as possible, which is easier to achieve with large moduli.

Several optimizations may be possible in specific circumstances. If the set of mobiles hosting the residue digits is the same for every record, the identification of mobiles need not be replicated in every record descriptor. If the error model excludes data corruption and only erasures are expected, the number of redundant residues should be no less than the expected number of disconnected or failed mobiles. If data confidentiality is not a concern, the set of moduli (both redundant and non-redundant) may be predefined and publicly disclosed. The mobiles creating new files need only to select an appropriate subset of redundant moduli to achieve the required degree of dependability.

In principle, a record could be reconstructed by a mobile that has guessed at least \( k \) residue digits, where \( k < h \). The correspondence of residue digits with the moduli is unknown to the malicious mobile, which must consider all possible \( k \)-tuples of residues in association with all permutations of the available moduli. Assuming the correct association of a \( k \)-tuple of residues with the \( k \) moduli is somehow guessed, the decoding procedure only yields an integer congruent to the record, which can be recovered by adding some (unknown) multiple of the product of some of the additional moduli.

Decoding the residues in this way leads to many legitimate numbers, making it very difficult to determine the correct one. If the records are plain ASCII, a clue may be provided by the fact that most legitimate numbers do not correspond to valid ASCII encoding. Data confidentiality can still be enforced by encrypting the record before encoding with RRNS.

Similarly to other techniques used in internet applications, the proposed data storage could also be used to speed up file access. This issue is the subject of ongoing studies. Future research will focus on an extended model allowing distribution of write privileges, accurate evaluation of performance and storage overhead, and analysis of the resilience of the encoding scheme based on RRNS in case of unauthorized access to the files.
