**ATT&CK ID:** T1563  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Remote Service Session Hijacking

Adversaries may hijack preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally within a network. This technique involves taking control of an established session, where a user has already authenticated using valid credentials to log into a service designed for remote access, such as Telnet, SSH, or RDP.

When a user logs into one of these services, a session is created, allowing them to maintain continuous interaction with the remote system. By hijacking this session, adversaries can gain unauthorized access and perform actions as if they were the legitimate user, thus facilitating lateral movement and further compromise of the environment.
