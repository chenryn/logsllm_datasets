breach the MDC system. Moreover, large-scale attacks are feasi-
ble, e.g., by exploiting Botnets or using multiple malicious servers.
They can be launched from the Internet, which is beyond control of
cellular operators.
3.1 On Authentication
3.1.1 Current Solution
To ensure authentication,
the current 3G/4G networks have
adopted mechanisms at multiple layers of the protocol stack.
It
adopts user authentication (Step 1) and IP address authentication
(Step 2), which are performed during the initial attach procedure.
Figure 2(a) depicts the attach procedure. The baseline user au-
thentication (Step 1) is ensured through the Authentication and
Key Agreement (AKA) procedure [7]. Each user obtains a unique
and permanent ID, called international mobile subscriber identity
(IMSI). The conﬁdential IMSI and its related key for user authen-
tication are securely stored in both the SIM/USIM card at the user
side and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS, akin to a database)
at the operator side. When the phone initially attaches to cellular
networks, AKA uses challenge-response based mechanisms to ver-
ify whether its local IMSI matches with the record stored in the
database. A temporary identity derived from IMSI is then used
to set up a secure connection against eavesdropping. Once com-
pleted, IP address authentication (Step 2) is performed through this
secure connection during the bearer activation process. A bearer is
for subsequent data transfer. Speciﬁcally, the Evolved Packet Sys-
tem (EPS) bearer is established to enable the connection-oriented
transmission in the 4G network. It is further carried by an underly-
ing GTP-U (GPRS Tunneling Protocol-User Plane) tunnel. During
this process, an IP address is allocated by the gateway, to the UE
through this secure connection. Consequently, the IP address is
authenticated with the UE.
Such IP address authentication is mandatory in cellular net-
works. This is a key difference from the Internet, where such au-
thentication is rarely required. From the charging standpoint, MDC
is thus able to map the charging (via the packet header, e.g., IP ad-
dress) into the authentic user.
3.1.2 Vulnerability Analysis
We discover a loophole that allows for bypassing the above au-
thentication scheme. The root cause lies in neither secure cross-
layer binding nor coordination between control and data planes.
As described above, cellular networks indeed perform control-
plane authentication when assigning an IP address. However, for
packet delivery on the data plane, enforcement of the assigned,
authentic IP address may be missing. The prior authentication is
circumvented when a forged IP address is embedded in the data
packet. MDC further associates its charging only based on the
packet header. Moreover, the current solution lacks secure cross-
layer binding. In cellular networks, data communication spans mul-
tiple layers of the protocol stack. A transport-layer ﬂow uses IP
packet delivery (Layer 3, L3), which is further carried by GTP-U
tunnels (Layer 2, L2). In Step 2, a tunnel ID (that identiﬁes the
GTP-U tunnel) is created by the core gateway and made known
to other gateways. Although data delivery to/from the UE is only
allowed over authenticated L2 tunnel, the L3 IP address carried
by the GTP-U payload is not required for veriﬁcation. This no-
binding operation results in an authentication-bypass loophole for
the charging process which is based on the IP address. For exam-
ple, as shown in Figure 2(b), when an adversary X forges U’s IP
address in his data transfer, MDC might charge U but not X.
Note that authentication is critical to both upstream and down-
stream packets. However, authentication bypass vulnerability may
not take effects on downstream packets unless the phone does not

intend to receive the real data. The forwarding path for downstream
is determined by the gateway based on the IP address and the pre-
deﬁned mapping. If authentication goes wrong, downstream pack-
ets arrive at the wrong destination. We thus focus on upstream only.
3.1.3 Exploit: Free Uplink Attack
The above loophole can be readily exploited for free uplink ac-
cess. Figure 3 illustrates the main attack idea. It uses IP spooﬁng
and shifts one’s uplink trafﬁc cost to other users. To facilitate bi-
directional data delivery, we deploy a proxy outside cellular net-
works, which helps to forward downlink trafﬁc to the true sender
when needed. The attack works as follows. First, the UE probes
several forged IP addresses and ﬁnds the spoofable ones. We ﬁnd
that not every IP spooﬁng works in the following validation. Sec-
ond, the UE registers its genuine IP address with the proxy if it
wants to receive the downlink trafﬁc. This is used to traverse NATs
and ﬁrewalls; the UE must send a packet ﬁrst to the proxy to allow
the downlink trafﬁc in. Finally, the UE uses the forged IP address
to deliver its uplink data transfer through the tunnel to the destina-
tion via the proxy. For UDP, the proxy only needs to modify the IP
address and the checksum in the packets. For TCP, the proxy uses
the Split-TCP scheme [12] to split an end-to-end TCP connection
into two separate ones. Everything else runs as usual, except uplink
packets are delivered with a forged IP address. This attack is ap-
pealing to those applications with heavy outbound trafﬁc, such as
phone backup, ﬁle upload (e.g., photo and video), and video instant
messaging (e.g., Skype, FaceTime). Although not all applications
carry heavy outbound trafﬁc, free of uplink charges still stimulates
such an exploit. More importantly, such a simple attack illustrates
the vulnerabilities in operational MDC systems.
IP spooﬁng is a well-known, yet unsolved security threat to the
wired Internet [14]. However, different from the Internet, cellular
MDC is still vulnerable even with user authentication! IP spooﬁng
was observed in some cellular carriers [38], but its impact on MDC
has not been examined. In fact, our in-depth study shows that not
each IP spooﬁng turns into real charging threats or even succeeds.
3.1.4 Experimental Validation
We carry out experiments to validate its vulnerability in two US
operational networks and assess the damage of the sketched attack.
Our empirical study conﬁrms that (i) authentication loophole in-
deed exists in operational networks. The carrier charges the wrong
user who does not perform data delivery. We ﬁnd out that, IP ad-
dress can be spoofed in both carriers and charging based on the IP
address is used in OP-I. In the tested attack, we conﬁrm that (ii)
the malicious phone gains free uplink access. There is no sign of
free volume limit. We further uncover that (iii) not each IP spoof-
ing succeeds.
It is constrained by geographic locations, cellular
technologies (e.g., 4G and 3G), and policy enforcement.
Loophole veriﬁcation. We address two issues using experi-
ments: (1) Is IP spooﬁng feasible in operational networks? (2)
How does it affect user charging? Though IP spooﬁng is observed
in [38], details are not given and Issue (2) is unaddressed. We thus
conduct two experiments. We explore the feasibility by sending
data packets from our phone to our server deployed outside the cel-
lular carrier, using various fabricated source IP addresses via Raw
Socket programming. To answer the second question, we run the
following two-phone experiment. Phone X uploads 1MB UDP traf-
ﬁc to our server using the IP address of phone U. During the test,
all other data services and background trafﬁc are cleaned up. We
compare the volume sent by X, and the itemized billing records for
X and U from the operator. Once U is charged, billing must be based
on the source IP address. Otherwise, if X is charged, spooﬁng does
not threaten data billing.
Table 2 summarizes our results in both carriers. We also plot
the spooﬁng results in both carriers and those in OP-I only us-
ing 2.5G/3G/4G technologies in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. We
make three observations. First, both carriers allow IP spooﬁng, and
the spoofable most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) is large. OP-I allows up
to /24 in spooﬁng (covering all the Class-A private address block
(10.x.x.x)), whereas OP-II allows up to /32. Second, not all IP
addresses are forgeable, and spoofable ratios ﬂuctuate in both car-
riers. In OP-I, the median spooﬁng ratio is around 10–16% when
the spoofable MSB is smaller than 16 (m ≤ 16). It shrinks sharply
(16. In contrast, OP-II has much larger spoofa-
ble ratio. In most cases, even the entire /21 block is spoofable. It
becomes low when m is large (m≥21). Third, spoofable ratios are
correlated with the used technologies (2.5G/3G/4G). In OP-I, its
3G network is the easiest to be spoofed. Full spoofability when
m ≤ 16 is observed in 3G; this occurs when certain external gate-
ways are used. We gauge that all these are caused by the different
policies on IP address allocation and ﬁltering.
To infer the charging constraints, we conduct the two-phone ex-
periments in various scenarios via OP-I. We ﬁnd that both phones
