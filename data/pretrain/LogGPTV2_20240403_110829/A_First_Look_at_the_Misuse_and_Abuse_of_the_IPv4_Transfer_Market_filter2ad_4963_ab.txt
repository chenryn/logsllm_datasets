mapped to an ASN, we compare the organization names using the string compar-
ison algorithm introduced by Myers [36]. The algorithm returns a value between
0 and 1, where 1 indicates identical strings. For values above 0.8 we consider
the organizations as siblings. To improve the accuracy of string comparison, we
ﬁlter-out from the organization names stop words, and the 100 most common
words across all names (e.g. Ltd, corporation, limited). Based on the above pro-
cess we infer 841 (29.6%) of the unlabeled transfers to be between sibling ASes
(Fig. 3).
Correlation of Transfers to BGP
Activity. We use daily routing tables
from all the Routeviews [62] and RIPE
RIS [46] collectors, to investigate how
the transferred IP address space is
advertised across time. For each trans-
fer for which we mapped the organiza-
tions to ASNs, we check whether the
transferred IP blocks are routed within
one year before and one year after their
reported transferred date. As shown in
Fig. 2, 97.05% of the IPs and 64% of
the preﬁxes are advertised consistently
across the entire period. ≈10% of the preﬁxes are only advertised after the trans-
fer, while about ≈5% are advertised only before the transfer, a practice that may
indicate speculative “hoarding” of IP addresses to resell at a higher price, which
has been a concern with removing needs-based address allocation [5]. However,
the reported transfer date does not correlate with a change in preﬁx origin for
65% of the transferred preﬁxes. In 15% of the cases the buyer advertises the
preﬁx one year before the transfer, while in 22% of the cases the seller contin-
ues to advertise the preﬁx one year after the transfer. These disparities can be
explained if the buyer organization uses the seller AS as its single-homed transit

provider and does not use its ASN to advertise the preﬁx. Additionally, it is
possible that a transfer may unoﬃcially occur before it is reported to the RIR.
We utilize BGP dynamics to expand the mapping of organization names in
reported transfers to ASNs. For each transferred preﬁx for which we did not
manage to map both buyer and seller to an ASN through WHOIS, we check
whether the preﬁx was originated by two diﬀerent ASNs before and after the
transfer date. We map the seller to the origin ASN before the switch, and the
seller to the origin ASN after the switch if the following three conditions are true:
(i) the time diﬀerence between the switch in the BGP origin and the transfer
date is less than two months, (ii) the preﬁx advertisements are visible by at least
10% of the BGP collector peers, and (iii) the origin ASNs advertise the preﬁx
consecutively for at least one month. We require condition (i) to ensure that the
routing shifts correlate with the transfer, and conditions (ii) and (iii) to ﬁlter-
out transient misconﬁgurations or hijacking incidents. Through this process we
are able to map the buyer and seller ASNs for an additional 23% of the transfers
(70% of the transfers in total).
Measuring the Deployed Transferred IP Space. The behavior of BGP
paths will help us interpret more accurately the observed malicious activities,
nonetheless routed address space is not necessarily deployed and used in prac-
tice [16,45]. To study the malicious behavior of the deployed transferred address
space we collect Internet-wide IP scans every 3 months between 2012-01-02 and
2019-09-01. We ﬁrst collect the ICMP ECHO REQUEST scans from the USC/ISC
project LANDER [18], which sweeps the IANA allocated IP ranges, and records
all the IPs that respond with an ICMP ECHO REPLY message. We complement
these data with Internet-wide UDP and TCP scans collected by RAPID7’s
project Sonar [41,42], which records the IPs that respond to ZMAP probes
against popular UDP and TCP services.
3.2 Detection of Malicious IPs and ASes
After we compile and process the IP transfers, we construct an extensive dataset
of cyber-attack sources to analyze the hygiene of the transferred address blocks
and the players within the IPv4 market.
Real-time BlackLists (RBLs) provide one of the most popular techniques to
detect networks responsible for attacks. Unfortunately, most blacklist providers
do not oﬀer historical snapshots, but typically they only publish the blacklist
at a certain web location that is refreshed periodically – daily or even hourly –
so that ﬁrewalls can automatically update their rules. However, we were able
to ﬁnd two large-scale historical blacklist datasets compiled and archived by
third-parties.
FinalBlacklist. Zhao et al. [64] compiled the FinalBlacklist dataset that
contains over 51 million blacklisting reports for 662K IPs between January 2007
A First Look at the Misuse and Abuse of the IPv4 Transfer Market
95
and June 2017, as part of a decade-long analysis of malicious Internet activ-
ity. To construct the FinalBlacklist, the authors collected historical black-
list snapshots through the Wayback Machine [24], which they extended using
VirusTotal [63], an API that aggregates periodic data from more than 70 Anti-
Virus and blacklist data feeds. 7.6 million (15%) of the blacklisting reports is
labeled by the original source with the type of the malicious activity, which the
authors abstract into six classes: Exploits, Malware, Fraudulent Services (FS),
Spammers, Phishing, and Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP). Based on the
labeled subset they employed a random forest classiﬁer to predict the class of the
remaining 44M blacklisted activities with 92.4% accuracy. 90.9% of the black-
listed IPs correspond to malware, while only (0.01%) correspond to Spammers.
RIPE Stat Abuse API. To augment the FinalBlacklist dataset with IPs
involved in the distribution of Spamming, we rely on data published by RIPE
NCC who is archiving daily snapshots since 2009-06-22 of the UCE-Protect
Network [61] blacklist1 [57], one of the most prominent anti-spamming blacklists.
RIPE NCC provides public access to these data through the RIPE Stat REST
API [53], which allows querying the blacklisting reports for a speciﬁc IP preﬁx
(no bulk querying). If an IP range within the queried preﬁx is blacklisted, the
API returns the blacklisting period (start and end date), allowing us to collect
historical blacklisting reports.
The UCE-Protect blacklist uses three diﬀerent levels of blacklisting poli-
cies, according to the severity and persistence of the observed malicious activity.
Level-1 blacklists only single IP addresses detected to deliver e-mails to spam
traps, conduct port scans or attack the UCE-Protect servers. Level-1 records
expire automatically after 7 days if there are no further attacks. Level-2 aims
to stop escalating attacks by blacklisting IP preﬁxes with multiple IPs that
emanate spam repeatedly for a week, implying lack of appropriate security mea-
sures or intentional misbehaviour. Level-3 blacklists all IPs within an ASN if
more than 100 IPs, but also a minimum of 0.2% of all IPs allocated to this ASN,
are Level-1 blacklisted within 7 days. This aggressive policy assumes that legit-
imate networks are unlikely to have a sustained high volume of blacklisted IPs.
Additionally, a preﬁx/ASN can get Level-2/3 blacklisted if a network employs
evasion techniques against blacklists, such as rotating the IPs of abusers within
a preﬁx, or blocking IP addresses of blacklist providers.
Detection of Persistent C&C Hosters. The activity of botnets is typically
coordinated by Command and Control (C&C) servers. C&C servers may only
orchestrate and not participate in attacks themselves, therefore their detection
is primarily based on honeypots. Shutting down of C&C servers is critical in
defending against botnets, an eﬀort that may even involve security agencies such
as the FBI [33], therefore legitimate network operators tend to respond quickly in
1 RIPE Stat also provides access to Spamhaus DROP snapshots which we do not use
because it covers only directly allocated address space.

requests for C&C take-downs in contrast to bulletproof hosters. We use data from
two distributed honeypots operated by BadPackets [11] and BinaryEdge [12] to
detect ASes that host C&C servers for over two weeks, despite notices by the
honeypot operators. We were able to detect 28 ASes that are persistent and
serial C&C hosters between February 2018 and June 2019.
As Reputation Lists Based on BGP Misbehavior. We complement the
set of malicious ASes compiled through the honeypot data with AS reputation
lists which are developed by monitoring the BGP routing system to detect ASes
with consistent patterns of malicious routing, such as traﬃc misdirection. We use
the list produced by Testart et al. [60], which we further extend with examples
of bulletproof hosters and hijackers reported by [15,27] resulting in a list of 922
malicious ASes.
4 Analysis and Results
Blacklisted Address Space. We ﬁrst compare the malicious activity emanat-
ing from transferred and non-transferred preﬁxes as reﬂected by our IP blacklist
reports. Table 1 summarizes the blacklist records per type of malicious activity,
for transferred and non-transferred IPs and preﬁxes. Transferred IPs are dis-
proportionately represented in the blacklist for every type of malicious activity
except spamming. In particular, the transferred address space represents only
16% of the total address space, but covers 61% of the blacklisted IPs. The frac-
tion of transferred preﬁxes with at least one blacklisted IP is 4x to 25x larger
than the fraction of non-transferred preﬁxes for every blacklist type, with spam
being the category with the smallest fraction of blacklisting reports per preﬁx.
As shown in Fig. 4, 40% of the routed transferred preﬁxes appear at least
once in our RBLs, compared to only 6% of the non-transferred routed preﬁxes.
However, the blacklisting activity does not originate uniformly across the address
A First Look at the Misuse and Abuse of the IPv4 Transfer Market
97
space. When we break down all preﬁxes to their covered/24 sub-preﬁxes we ﬁnd
that the blacklisted IPs are concentrated in 6% of the transferred/24s, and in
only 1% of the non-transferred/24s (Fig. 4b). This happens because some of the
less speciﬁc transferred preﬁxes are owned by large-scale legitimate networks,
such as Tier-1 providers, that proportionally originate a very small fraction of
blacklisting reports. For example, the preﬁx 50.128.0.0/9 which was transferred
by an acquisition from Comcast includes 32, 768/24 sub-preﬁxes (more than all
transferred preﬁxes), but has only 289 blacklisting reports. Still, transferred/24
sub-preﬁxes are 6x more likely to be blacklisted, than the non-transferred ones.
Blacklisted ASNs. We analyze the blacklisting reports per ASN, to under-
stand how the detected malicious activity is distributed across the participants
of the IP transfer market. Almost 50% of all the ASNs that participate in the
transfer market appear at least once in the blacklist, compared to only 16% of
the ASNs that do not participate in the transfer market and appear in the BGP
table to originate preﬁxes (Fig. 5a). Moreover, ASes in the transfer market tend
to have a larger fraction of their address space blacklisted, with a median of
0.06% compared to 0.03% for ASes not involved in any transfer, which is an
indication of more consistent malicious behaviour. This trend is even more pro-
nounced for ASes that are both sellers and buyers of IP preﬁxes, which for some
ASes appear to be a strategy to recycle blacklisted preﬁxes. To study whether
the higher blacklisting rate of ASNs involved in transfers may be explained by a
bias in the composition of ASNs that exchange IP space, we compare their user
population according to APNIC’s estimates [20], and we also compare their self-
reported business type in PeeringDB [2]. For both datasets the composition of
ASNs is very similar, with ASNs absent from transfers exhibiting slightly higher
median user population.
While the blacklisted preﬁxes are distributed across half of the ASNs involved
in transfers, there are 26 ASes with more than 10K blacklisted IPs, including
prominent cloud providers (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, OVH) and Tier-1
providers (e.g. GTT, CenturyLink, Seabone). Attackers often utilize cloud plat-
forms as a cost-eﬀective way to host malicious software in short-lived Virtual
