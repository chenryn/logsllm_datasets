## Abstract
Intellectual diversity, or the use of different perspectives, has long been employed to minimize the impact of mistakes in human endeavors. Over the past few decades, design diversity has been used to enhance the dependability of software-based systems. This practice has led to the first formal studies on the effectiveness of intellectual diversity. In this paper, we examine the role of diverse arguments, particularly those supporting claims about system dependability (reliability, safety). Our aim is to determine whether the probabilistic approach that has proven effective in design diversity can be applied to argument diversity. The work presented here is exploratory and speculative.

## 1. Introduction
The principle of intellectual diversity—“two heads are better than one”—has long been used informally to guard against errors. For example, asking a colleague to check a computation you have made is more likely to catch mistakes than if you checked it yourself. In engineering, design diversity is often used to protect against common faults that may be present in redundant systems. Specifically, design diversity has been proposed as a means to mitigate software faults (see [1] for a recent review).

In this paper, we explore the use of diversity in arguments, known as multi-legged arguments, particularly in the context of making claims about system dependability (safety, reliability, etc.). Our goal is to formalize the understanding of this use of diversity to increase confidence in the dependability claims made about systems.

An example of argument diversity in a safety case was seen during the licensing of the UK’s Sizewell B nuclear power plant. The issue concerned the probability of failure on demand (PFD) of the software in the Primary Protection System (PPS). A two-legged argument was used [2], based on the "special case" procedure outlined in the UK’s Safety Assessment Principles for Nuclear Power Plants [3]. The first leg focused on the quality of the production procedures used by the software manufacturer, while the second leg involved confirmatory assessments of the built product (e.g., testing, static analysis).

Several standards and codes of practice recommend the use of diverse arguments, but there is little consensus on the nature of the arguments that should form the legs, nor on the benefits of such an argument structure. For instance, in the UK’s Def Stan 00-55 [4], one leg is based on logical proof, and the other on a probabilistic claim derived from statistical analysis. The legs can be quite asymmetric; for example, in [5], the first leg is potentially complex, while the second is deliberately simple. Sometimes, the only difference between the legs lies in the people involved, which can provide some protection against identical human errors, especially when hard evidence is scarce and expert judgment is necessary.

These examples highlight the need for a better understanding of the use of diversity in arguments. While diversity seems intuitively beneficial, there is no theoretical foundation to support this assertion. We do not know the best ways to use diversity or how much confidence can be claimed from its use in specific cases.

This situation contrasts with design diversity, where probability models have provided significant insights. The strong parallels between design diversity and argument diversity have motivated our current work. We hope that some of the ideas from design diversity can be applied to create a more formal framework for understanding diverse arguments.

It is worth noting that diversity is central to the "hard" sciences, such as the repeatability of experiments and independent peer review. Social scientists have also studied this kind of diversity. For example, it has been suggested that there may be serious limitations to what can be claimed for diversity in physics [6]. Are there lessons for the use of diversity in dependability arguments? On one hand, it is concerning that physicists can make mistakes, both individually and as a community. A pessimistic view would be that if this can happen despite diverse checks, we should not place too much faith in the use of diversity by software and safety engineers. On the other hand, there is general agreement that the scientific method, with its use of human diversity, generally gets things right.

In the following sections, we discuss the issues that need to be addressed to gain a proper understanding of diverse arguments. We will also present some tentative formalisms that might help in this understanding. This is early work in this area, and we make no strong claims for the results reported here. Our intention is to provoke thought rather than provide comprehensive answers.

## 2. Why Multi-Legged Argument Structure?
Multi-legged arguments have most commonly been used in safety cases for critical systems. In such situations, there is a need to consider a wide range of disparate evidence, such as testing data, logical reasoning about the impossibility of certain types of failure, and expert judgment on the quality of design and build procedures.

One might ask why such disparate evidence should be organized into a small number of argument legs rather than used in other ways to support dependability claims. For example, Bayesian Belief Nets (BBNs) offer a more general way to incorporate different kinds of evidence. Why restrict oneself to a subset of these more general arguments? What are the characteristics and properties of the BBN topologies in multi-legged arguments?

One practical reason for using multiple argument legs is that it is simpler than trying to build a single, all-encompassing argument. The evidence available for safety cases is typically of many disparate types, and it can be challenging to obtain and justify the topology for a general BBN argument. Restricting oneself to a small number of argument legs, such as one for process quality and one for the built product, can greatly simplify reasoning by enforcing a very simple topology in the BBN framework.

We suspect that the use of multi-legged argument structures is also motivated by the metaphor with design diversity and redundancy. In design diversity, high system reliability can often be achieved by using several functionally similar subsystems. The use of diverse designs to protect against faults in a single version is similar to the use of diverse argument legs to protect against flaws in a single leg.

Alternatively, the idea of legs can be seen as a way to structure an approach to the levels of defense, both technical (e.g., use of different techniques) and organizational (e.g., use of different organizations), that have historically been used in the assessment of safety-critical systems. It serves as a metaphor to help explain this complex assessment process to other parties, such as at a public inquiry.

It is worth mentioning that multi-legged arguments are often required for reasons other than protection against inadvertent failure. They are sometimes invoked due to issues of trust, such as whether the supplier actually conducted the testing they claimed. There is a parallel here with the use of diversity to protect systems against malicious faults, such as the use of diverse intrusion detection techniques.

It is interesting that multi-legged arguments are sometimes described as involving independent argument legs. This informal use of the word "independent" is likely misleading, as a similar usage was in design diversity. Several years ago, there was considerable controversy in the software fault tolerance community about the exact nature of claims made about "independent" development of multiple designs [7]. We now know that claims for statistical independence between failures of diverse versions are unreasonable, limiting the claims that can be made for the dependability of a design-diverse system. If the metaphor holds, similar limitations will apply to the confidence that can be claimed for diverse argument legs.

On the other hand, we might expect that a multi-legged argument, like a multi-version design, will provide more confidence in a safety claim than a single leg alone. The key issue is how much extra confidence is gained. As in design diversity, the question is whether the extra confidence justifies the additional cost. For a given cost, is it necessarily best to use this kind of argument structure? Might it be possible, for a particular set of disparate evidence, to organize it in other ways and gain greater confidence than can be obtained from a multi-legged structure?

Although we do not have answers to these questions yet, their importance is clear. In critical systems, the costs of justifying safety claims can be enormous and are likely to grow. In some cases, these costs can exceed those needed to build the system. For example, the French RER railway in Paris contains a safety-critical system with about 20,000 lines of code [8]; 100 person-years were spent on safety assurance. NASA has quoted figures of over $1,000 per line for the production and assurance of Space Shuttle code, which is known to contain many faults. For some systems, the levels of confidence needed seem so high as to be beyond what can be claimed from the deployment of feasible amounts of evidence in conventional arguments. Can the use of argument diversity be shown to justify significantly stronger claims without requiring more evidence?

## 3. How are Multi-Legged Arguments Built? – Informal Discussion
Multi-legged arguments exhibit a variety of structures and use different types of content in the different legs. Examples of two-legged arguments include:

1. **Logical Proof and Statistical Evidence**: One leg based on logical proof and the other on statistical evidence from operational testing. For example, in a software dependability argument, the first leg could claim complete freedom from a class of faults, while the second leg could claim a specific PFD [4, 9].
2. **Indirect and Direct Evidence**: One leg based on indirect evidence, such as design process quality, and the other on direct evaluation of the built system, each involving expert judgment. For example, in software, the first leg could involve evidence such as CMM (Capability Maturity Model) level and types of procedures used, while the second leg could involve evidence of static analysis and operational testing [2].
3. **Primary and Secondary Legs**: A primary argument leg involving extensive evidence, and a simpler secondary leg designed to compensate for potential weaknesses in the primary [5].
4. **Different Teams**: Legs based on the same evidence but analyzed by different, non-communicating teams of experts.

Some of these arguments mimic the use of diversity in fault-tolerant design. For example, the use of different, non-communicating teams of experts (Example 4) captures the common design diversity notion of unforced diversity between "functionally identical" channels. Example 3 is similar to a system architecture where a primary channel has extensive functionality (at the cost of complexity), while a secondary "get-you-home-safely" channel is kept simple—often, the first is implemented in software, and the second in hard-wired logic.

While these examples all involve diversity, the diversity is used in different ways, and the legs differ widely in content and type of claim. In Example 1, the first leg involves a claim for complete perfection of operational behavior (at least with respect to a subclass of failures) based on logical reasoning, while the second leg would only allow a probabilistic claim based on statistical evidence. If the overall argument is intended to support a claim of (better than) 10^-4 PFD, only the statistical leg addresses this directly. However, the logical leg can support the other: if the statistical evidence alone gives 99% confidence that the PFD is smaller than 10^-4, the additional "proof leg" might increase this confidence.

However, the observation of a failure in the testing leg would completely refute the perfection claim of the first leg. A similar potential dependence can be seen in the second example: direct evidence from the examination of the built system in the second argument leg could cast doubt on the claims for process quality from the first leg. Just as claims for independence between system failures are generally not believable, there is likely to be dependence between different argument legs.

The differences between these examples suggest that there is no consensus on the best ways to structure diverse arguments. Informally, our goal is to make claims at as high a "level" as possible, with as much "confidence" as we can achieve. However, it is not clear how to achieve these goals or how to formally express them (e.g., how to resolve the trade-off between claim level and confidence).

For example, what are the relative merits of arguments that mimic the symmetric structure of 1-out-of-2 protection systems and those asymmetric arguments where a second leg compensates for the expected weaknesses of a primary leg? Perhaps the former is more appropriate when we have little knowledge of the precise ways in which arguments might fail, relying on a general claim for the efficacy of diversity.

What are the relative merits of "forced" and "natural" diversity? This may come down to how much knowledge we have about potential weaknesses in arguments. Issues of this kind also arise when diversity is used to achieve dependability in systems, where it is necessary to be confident that "functional diversity" fits the problem. For example, in the design of a 1-out-of-2 protection system, the choice to monitor temperature and pressure in different channels, rather than temperature and flow rate, requires knowledge on the part of the designers.

The answers to these questions likely depend on a better understanding of what we are trying to protect ourselves from by using diverse arguments. The weaknesses in single arguments that might be addressed by diversity seem to fall into two categories: weaknesses in modeling assumptions and weaknesses in evidence.

Any argument to support a dependability claim about a system will depend on some assumptions. For example, a claim of "perfection" about some software, based on a formal verification that the program correctly implements its specification, assumes that the formal specification accurately represents higher-level informal engineering requirements. If we had any doubt about this assumption (and how could we not?), we might require a second argument leg in the form of extensive operational testing. Seeing no failures in the testing (judged against the engineering requirements) would increase our confidence in the truth of the assumption (despite what Edsger Dijkstra said [10]).

Weaknesses in the evidence for a single argument leg can also be a reason to require a second leg. For example, if the first leg involves a statistical claim using operational testing, but it is infeasible to test for sufficiently long to substantiate the claim at the required level of confidence, we might require a second argument leg involving extensive static analysis.

Whatever the reason for using multiple argument legs, the intention is always the same: to have more (justifiable) confidence in the dependability of our system from the two (or more) legs than from either one alone. The issue of composability is fundamental: how much benefit do we get from this approach in a particular instance? In the following section, we present a tentative formalism to address this question for a simple example of a two-legged argument.

## 4. Argument "Strength" vs. Argument "Dependence" – A Tentative Formalism
In dependability analyses, the reliability of a 1-out-of-2 design-diverse system is determined by the reliabilities of the individual versions and the dependence between the two version failure processes. Considerable effort has gone into studying these relationships to understand the trade-offs and maximize system reliability for a given effort or cost.

Similar considerations apply to two-legged arguments, but it is not immediately clear what the equivalents of "version reliability" and "failure dependence" are. Perhaps some notion of argument "strength" is equivalent to version (or channel) reliability. For example, this could be expressed in terms of the confidence that can be placed in an argument claim: an argument that gives 99% confidence that the PFD is smaller than 10^-3 is "stronger" than one that gives only 95% confidence in the same claim.

As an aside, it should be noted that the numbers here will need to be subjective probabilities in the Bayesian sense—i.e., measures of strength of belief. Thus, if you have 99% confidence, your subjective probability is 0.99. Your subjective beliefs may be based, at least partly, on evidence that allows a frequentist interpretation of probability. However, there is likely to be some element of judgment involved, for which the frequentist approach is inappropriate.

Argument dependence might also be defined in terms of confidence. Two arguments could be considered independent if they allow simple multiplicative manipulation of confidence, as in the case of reliability. For example, if two arguments A and B each give 90% confidence that the PFD is smaller than 10^-3, and together they give 99% confidence in the same claim, they would be considered independent.

In practice, it seems unlikely that arguments will be independent in this way, just as claims for independence between the failure behavior of design-diverse systems are rarely believable. For two argument legs, each having a particular level of confidence about the same claim, the "degree of dependence" between them will be indicated implicitly by the increase in confidence in the claim that arises from using the two together.

Notice, however, that dependence is not necessarily "a bad thing": as in design diversity [11], there may be the (theoretical) possibility for a kind of negative covariance in argument diversity, resulting in even greater confidence than would come from independence.

We can develop these ideas slightly more formally in certain circumstances. Each argument leg can be thought of as a triple, comprising some evidence and modeling assumptions that together support a claim or assertion. Associated with each triple will be a level of confidence in the claim when supported by the evidence and assumptions.

Consider the situation of an argument leg A in which a safety goal is expressed as an assertion, GA. For example:
- **GA**: "The probability of failure on demand of the protection system software is less than 10^-3."

Argument A is based on some assumptions, denoted as assA. An example might be:
