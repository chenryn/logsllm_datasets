Abstract
Intellectual diversity – difference – has long been used in
human  affairs  to  minimise  the  impact  of  mistakes.  In  the
past  couple  of  decades  design  diversity  has  been  used  to
seek  dependability  in  software-based  systems.  This  use  of
design  diversity  prompted  the  first  formal  studies  of  the
efficacy of intellectual diversity. In this paper we examine
diverse  arguments  –  in  particular  arguments  to  support
claims about system dependability (reliability, safety). Our
purpose  is  to  see whether the probabilistic approach that
has been so successful in design diversity can be applied to
diversity  in  arguments.  The  work  reported  here  is
somewhat tentative and speculative.
1. Introduction
Intellectual diversity – ‘two heads are better than one’
–  has  long  been  used  informally  to  protect  against
mistakes. A simple example would be asking a colleague
to check a computation you had made: the idea here is that
the use of a different person (intellectual diversity) is more
likely to pick up your mistakes than if you simply checked
your own work. In engineering, diversity in design is often
used  to  gain  protection  from  common  faults  that  may  be
present in merely redundant systems. In particular, design
diversity  has  been  proposed  as  a  means  of  protecting
against software faults (see [1] for a recent review of work
in this area).
In  this  paper  we  consider  the  use  of  diversity  in
arguments  –  so-called  multi-legged  arguments  –
specifically arguments that are used to make claims about
the dependability (safety, reliability, etc) of a system. Our
intention is to begin to formalise understanding of this use
of diversity, so that greater confidence can be placed in the
dependability claims that are made about systems.
An example of the application of argument diversity to
a  safety  case  occurred  during  the  licensing  of  the  UK’s
Sizewell B nuclear power plant. The issue here concerned
what could be claimed about the probability of failure on
demand  (pfd)  of  the  software  in  the  Primary  Protection
System (PPS). A two-legged argument was used [2] based
on  the  ‘special  case’  procedure  of  the  UK’s  Safety
Assessment Principles for Nuclear Power Plants [3] (also
available  at  http://www.hse.gov.uk/nsd/saps.htm).  The
first  leg  was  essentially  ‘process’-based  and  concerned
the  quality  of  the  production  procedures  used  by  the
manufacturer  of  the  software;  the  second  leg  was  a
confirmatory  one,  based  on  assessments  of  the  built
product (testing, static analysis, etc).
Several  standards  and  codes  of  practice  suggest  the
use of diverse arguments, but there is little agreement on
the  exact  nature  of  the  arguments  that  should  form  the
legs, nor is there any clear indication of the benefits that
will  accrue  from  this  kind  of  argument  structure.  In UK
Def  Stan  00-55  [4],  for  example,  one  leg  is  based  upon
logical  proof,  the  other  upon  a  probabilistic  claim  based
upon  statistical  analysis.  The  legs  are  sometimes  quite
asymmetric: for example, in [5] the first leg is potentially
complex, whereas the second leg is deliberately simple1.
Occasionally, the only difference between the legs lies in
the  people  involved.  This  is  a  plausible  approach,
particularly,  when  there  is  a  paucity  of  hard  evidence
upon which to base the arguments, and thus necessarily a
large element of expert judgement – different teams might
provide  some  protection  against  identical  human
mistakes.
The  differences  shown  in  these  examples  reflect,  we
believe, the need for better understanding about the use of
diversity  in  arguments.  At  an  informal  level,  diversity
seems  plausibly  to  be  ‘a  good  thing’,  but  there  is  no
theoretical  underpinning  to  such  an  assertion.  For
example, we do not know what are the ‘best’ ways to use
diversity  (nor  even  exactly  what  ‘best’  means  here);  we
do  not  know  how  much  we  can  claim  for  the  use  of
diversity in a particular case.
This  situation  contrasts  with  that  in  design diversity,
where  probability  models  have  provided  significant  new
1 The language here – and indeed the underlying structure – is very
similar  to  a  type  of  design  diversity  used  in  certain  types  of  safety
system, where a complex, highly functional primary version is backed
up by a much more simple secondary system. This is just one of many
examples  of  the  duality  between  design  diversity  and  argument
diversity, an issue we intend to address in more detail in future work.

insights2. It is the strong parallels between design diversity
and  argument  diversity  that  has  prompted  the  present
work: we hope that some of the design-diversity ideas will
carry  across  to  provide  a  more  formal  framework  for
understanding diverse arguments.
It is worth saying, in passing, that diversity lies at the
heart of the ‘hard’sciences, e.g. in notions of repeatability
of experiments, of independent peer review, etc. There has
been  some  study  of  this  kind  of  diversity  by  social
scientists.    It  has  been  claimed,  for  example,  that  there
may sometimes be quite serious limitations to what can be
claimed for diversity in physics  [6]. Are there any lessons
for  the  use  of  diversity  in  dependability  arguments  here?
On  the  one  hand,  it  is  somewhat  alarming  to  realise  that
physicists can get things wrong (both individually and as a
community). A pessimistic view would be that if this can
happen  in  spite  of  diverse  checks,  then  we  should  not
make  strong  claims  for  the  use  of  diversity  by  software
and  safety  engineers.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  general
agreement  that  the  scientific  method  –  with  its  use  of
human diversity – does generally get things right.

we  think  need  addressing  before  we  can  have  a  proper
understanding of diverse arguments. We shall also present

2. Why multi-legged argument structure?
Multi-legged  arguments  have  so  far  most  commonly
been  used  in  safety  cases  for  critical  systems.  In  such
situations  there  is  generally  the  need  to  take  account  of
much  evidence  of  disparate  types.  Examples  include:
testing data, logical reasoning about the ‘impossibility’ of
certain  types  of  failure,  human  expert  judgement  (for
example  about  the  quality  of  the  design  and  build
procedures), and so on.
It  is  reasonable  to  ask  why  such  disparate  evidence
should  be  marshalled  into  a  small  number  of  argument
legs,  rather  than  being  used  in  other  ways  to  support
claims about dependability. For example, Bayesian Belief
Nets are a more general way of taking account of different
kinds  of  evidence  to  support  dependability  claims:  why
should  one  restrict  oneself  to  a  particular  subset  of  this
more  general  class  of  arguments?  Equally,  what  are  the
characteristics  and  properties  of  the  BBN  topologies  of
multi-legged arguments?
2  It  has  to  be  admitted  that  these  insights  have  been  mainly
conceptual  ones  –  there  remain  great  difficulties  in  estimating  the
parameters  of  the  models  in  particular  instances  to  allow  their  use  in
safety  cases.  Nevertheless,  the  models  have  produced  better
understanding  –  for  example  by  warning  of  the  perils  of  unwarranted
assumptions of independence of failure behaviour between versions.
One  important  practical  reason  why  evidence  is
marshalled  into  multiple  argument  legs  is  that  this  is
simpler  than  trying  to  build  a  single  all-embracing
argument. The evidence available to support safety cases
is typically of many disparate types, and it can be difficult
to  obtain,  and  justify,  the  topology  for  a  general  BBN
argument.  Restricting  oneself  to  a  small  number  of
arguments legs – e.g. one for process ‘quality’ and one for
‘built  product’  –  can  greatly  simplify  reasoning,
essentially by enforcing  (in  the  BBN  framework)  a  very
simple topology.
We suspect, furthermore, that the use of multi-legged
argument  structure  is  motivated  by  the  metaphor  with
design  diversity  and  redundancy.  Here,  it  is  known  that
high  system  reliability  can  often  be  obtained  by  using
several subsystems that are (usually) functionally similar
to one another. In particular, the use of diverse designs to
protect against design faults in a single version does seem
similar  to  the  use  of  diverse  argument  legs  to  protect
against flaws in a single leg.
Alternatively we might see the idea of legs as a way of
trying to structure an approach to the levels of defence –
both  technical  (e.g.  use  of  different  techniques)  and
organisational  (e.g. use of different organisations)  – that
has  grown  up  historically  in  the  assessment  of  safety
critical systems. It is introduced as a metaphor that helps
explain  this  complicated  assessment  process  to  other
parties, e.g at a public inquiry.
It is worth mentioning that multi-legged arguments are
often  required  for  reasons  other  than  protection  against
‘inadvertent’  failure.  They  are  sometimes  invoked
because  of  issues  of  trust:  e.g.  did  the  supplier  actually
carry  out  the  testing  that  has  been  claimed?  There  is  a
parallel here with the use of diversity to protect systems
against malicious faults, e.g. the use of diverse intrusion
detection techniques.
It  is  interesting  that  multi-legged  arguments  are
sometimes  described  as  involving independent  argument
legs. It seems likely that this is merely an informal use of
the word ‘independent’, and that this usage will turn out
to  be  as  misleading  as  a  similar  usage  was  in  design
diversity.  Several  years  ago  there  was  considerable
controversy  in  the  software  fault  tolerance  community
about the exact nature of the claims that had been made
about ‘independent’ development of multiple designs [7].
We  now  know  that  claims  for  statistical  independence
between failures of diverse versions are unreasonable: this
fact  limits  the  claims  that  can  be  made  for  the
dependability  of  a  design-diverse  system.  It  seems
reasonable  to  expect  that,  if  the  metaphor  holds,  similar
limitations  will  apply  to  the  confidence  that  can  be
claimed for diverse argument legs.
On  the  other  hand,  we  might  expect  that  the  multi-
legged argument – just as the multi-version design – will
provide more confidence in (say) a safety claim than will
one  of  the  legs  alone.  The  important  issue,  of  course,
concerns how  much  extra  confidence  is  gained.  As  in
design  diversity,  the  question  is  whether  the  extra

confidence  of  argument  diversity  justifies  the  extra  cost.
Putting  it  another  way:  for  a  given  cost,  is  it  necessarily
best  to  use  this  kind  of  argument  structure?  Might  it  be
possible,  for  a  particular  set  of  disparate  evidence,  to
marshall it in other ways and gain greater confidence than
can be obtained from multi-legged structure?
Although we do not have answers to questions of this
kind  right  now,  their  importance  is  without  doubt.  In
critical systems, particularly, the costs of justifying safety
claims can be enormous, and are likely to grow.  In  some
cases, these costs can be greater than those needed to build
the system. For example, the French RER railway in Paris
contains a safety-critical system with about 20,000 lines of
code [8]; 100 person years was spent on safety assurance.
NASA  quoted  several  years  ago  a  figure  of  more  than
$1,000  per  line  for  production  and  assurance  of  Space
Shuttle  code,  and  it  is  known  that  this  contains  many
faults. For some systems, the levels of confidence needed
seem  so  high  as  to  be  beyond  what  can  be  claimed  from
the  deployment  of  feasible  amounts  of  evidence  in
conventional arguments. Can the use of argument diversity
be shown to justify significantly stronger claims like these
without requiring more evidence?
3. How are multi-legged arguments built? –
informal discussion
It  is  notable  that  multi-legged  arguments  show  very
different structures, and use very different types of content
in the different legs. Examples, for two-legged arguments,
include:
1. A  leg  based  upon  logical  proof  and  a  leg  based  upon
statistical evidence from operational testing: e.g. in the
case of an argument about software dependability, the
first could involve a claim of complete freedom from
(a  class  of)  faults,  the  second  a  claim  for  a  particular
probability of failure upon demand (pfd) [4, 9]
2. A  leg  based  upon  indirect  evidence,  such  as  design
process quality, and a leg based upon direct evaluation
of the built system, each  leg involving assessment via
expert judgement: e.g. in the case of software, the first
could  involve  evidence  such  as  CMM  (Capability
Maturity  Model)  level  and  types  of  procedures  used,
the  second  could  involve  evidence  of  static  analysis
and of operational testing [2];
3. A primary argument leg involving extensive evidence,
and  a  simpler  secondary  leg  whose  purpose  is  just  to
compensate  for  potentially  serious  weaknesses  in  the
primary [5];
4. Legs  that  are  based  upon  exactly  the  same  evidence,
but use different, non-communicating teams of human
expert analysts.
It  is  striking how some of these arguments mimic the
use  of  diversity  in  fault-tolerant  design.  Thus  4  captures
the common design diversity notion of unforced diversity
between  ‘functionally  identical’  channels:  it  is  the  only
one in which the evidence (input) and claim (output) are
the  same  between  the  two  legs. Example  3  is  similar  to
the  system  architecture  in  which  a  primary  channel  has
extensive functionality (at the price of complexity), whilst
a  second  ‘get-you-home-safely’  channel  is  deliberately
kept simple –  often the first is implemented in software,
the second in hard-wired logic.
Whilst  these  examples  all  involve  diversity,  this
diversity  is  used  in  quite  different  ways,  and  the  legs
differ  widely  both  in  content  and  type  of  claim.  In
example  1,  the  first  leg  involves  a  claim  for  complete
perfection of operational behaviour (at least with respect
to  a  subclass  of  failures)  based  upon  logical  reasoning,
whereas the second leg would only allow a probabilistic
claim based  upon  statistical  evidence.  If  the  overall
argument  is  intended  to  support  a  claim  of  (better  than)
10-4 p f d,  only  the  statistical  leg  addresses  this  directly.
Nevertheless,  it  is  easy  to  see  how  the  logical  leg  can
support  the  other:  if  the  statistical  evidence  alone  gives
99% confidence that the pfd is smaller than 10-4, then the
additional ‘proof leg’ might allow this level of confidence
in 10-4 to be increased.
Note, however, that the observation of a failure in the
testing  leg  would  completely  refute  the  perfection  claim
of  the  first  leg.  A  similar  potential  dependence  can  be
seen in the second example: direct evidence arising from
the  examination  of  the  built  system  in  the  second
argument leg could cast doubt upon the claims for process
quality  coming  from  the  first  leg.  Just  as  claims  for
independence  between  system  failures  are  generally  not
believable,  so  it  seems  we  might  expect  there  to  be
dependence between different argument legs.
The  differences  between  these  examples  suggest  that
there  is  no  agreement  about  the  best  ways  to  structure
diverse arguments. Informally, we might say that our goal
is  to  make  claims  at  as  high  a  ‘level’  as  we  can,  with
‘confidence’ as high as we can make it. But it is not clear
how we should go about achieving these goals, nor even
how  we  should  formally  express  them (e.g.  how  we
should  resolve  the  trade-off  between  claim  level  and
confidence).
For example, what are the relative merits of arguments
that  mimic  the  symmetric  structure  of  1-out-of-2
protection  systems,  and  those  unsymmetric arguments
where  a  second  leg  is  designed  to  compensate  for  the
expected  weaknesses  of  a  primary  leg?  Perhaps  the
former are more appropriate for those situations where we
have  little  knowledge  of  the  precise  ways  in  which
arguments might fail – here we would be depending upon
a claim for general efficacy of diversity.
What are the relative merits of ‘forced’ and ‘natural’
diversity?  Again,  this  may  come  down  to  how  much
knowledge  we  have  about  potential  weaknesses  in
arguments  –  we  need  to  know  that,  if  we  have  forced
diversity  in  a  particular  way,  this  is  appropriate  for  our
problem.  Issues  of  this  kind  also  arise,  of  course,  when
diversity is used to achieve dependability in systems; here
Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN’03) 
0-7695-1959-8/03 $17.00 (c) 2003 IEEE
also  it  is  necessary  to  be  confident  that  ‘functional
diversity’ fits the problem. For example, in the design of a
1-out-of-2  protection  system 
the  choice  to  monitor
temperature and pressure  in the different channels, rather
than  (say)  temperature  and  flow  rate, requires knowledge
on the part of the designers.
The  answers  to  questions  like  these  probably  depend
on understanding better what it is we are trying to protect
ourselves  from  by using diverse arguments. What are the
kinds  of  weaknesses  present  in  single  arguments  that
might be addressed by diversity?  These  seem  to  fall  into
two  kinds:  weaknesses  in  modelling  assumptions,  and
weaknesses in evidence3.
Any argument to support a dependability claim about a
system will depend upon some assumptions. For example,
a claim of ‘perfection’ about some software, based upon a
formal verification that the program correctly implements
its specification,  assumes  that  this  formal  specification  is
an  accurate  representation  of  some  higher  level  informal
engineering  requirements.  If  we  had  any  doubt  about  the
truth  of  this  assumption  (and  how  could  we  not?),  we
might  require  a  second  argument  leg  in  the  form  of
appropriately  extensive  operational  testing.  Seeing  no
failures  in  the  testing  (judged  against  the  engineering
requirements) would make us more confident in the truth
of  the  assumption  (in  spite  of  what  Edsger  Dijkstra
said4…).
Weaknesses in the evidence for a single argument leg
can  similarly  be  a  reason  to  require  a  second  leg.  For
example,  here  we  might  reverse  the  reasoning  of  the
previous  paragraph.  If  the  first  leg  involves  a  statistical
claim using operational testing, but it is infeasible to test
for  sufficiently  long  to  substantiate  the  claim  at  the
required  level  of  confidence,  we  might  require  a  second
argument leg involving extensive static analysis.
Whatever the reason for using multiple argument legs,
the  intention  is  always  the  same:  we  want  to  be  able  to
have more (justifiable) confidence in the dependability of
our system from the two (or more) legs than is provided by
either  one  alone.  This  issue  of  composability seems
fundamental:  how  much  benefit  do  we  get  from  this
approach in a particular instance? In the following section
we present a somewhat tentative formalism to address this
question for a simple example of a two-legged argument.
3  For  simplicity  we  shall  ignore  here  a  third  possibility,  that  the
reasoning  used  by  the  expert  to  make  the  claim,  based  on  the
assumptions and the evidence, is flawed. This may need to be considered
in some cases, but we believe that it can be treated as a simple extension
of the general approach described here.
4  ‘Program  testing  can  be  used  to  show  the  presence  of  bugs,  but
never to show their absence!’ [10]
4. Argument ‘strength’ vs argument
‘dependence’ – a tentative formalism
In dependability analyses, the reliability of a 1-out-of-
2 design diverse system is determined by the reliabilities
of the individual versions and the dependence between the
two  version  failure  processes.  Considerable  effort  has
gone  into  studying  the  relationships  here  in  attempts  to
understand the trade-offs and thus be able, for example, to
maximise the system reliability for a given effort or cost.
It  seems  obvious  that  similar  considerations  apply  in
the  case  of  two-legged  arguments,  but  it  is  not
immediately  clear  what  are  the  equivalents  of  ‘version
reliability’ and ‘failure dependence’. Perhaps some notion
of  argument  ‘strength’  is  equivalent  to  version  (or
channel) reliability5. For example, this could be expressed
in  terms  of  the  confidence  that  could  be  placed  in  an
argument claim: an argument that gives 99% confidence
that the pfd is smaller than 10-3 is ‘stronger’ than one that
only gives 95% confidence in the same claim.
As an aside, it should be noted that the numbers here
will  need  to  be  subjective  probabilities  in  the  Bayesian
sense  –  i.e.  they  should  be  regarded  as  measures  of
strength of belief. Thus if you have 99% confidence this
means that your subjective probability is 0.99. Of course,
your subjective beliefs may be based, at least partly, upon
evidence  that  allows  a  frequentist  interpretation  of
probability. But as we shall see, there is likely also to be
some  element  of  judgement  involved,  for  which  the
frequentist approach is inappropriate.
if 
Argument dependence might also be defined in terms
of confidence. Thus we could say that two arguments are
independent 
they  allow  simple  multiplicative
manipulation  of  confidence,  as  in  the  case  of  reliability.
For example, we would say that two arguments A  and  B
are  independent  if  each  individually  gives  90%
confidence  that  the pfd  is  smaller  than  10-3  and together
they give 99% confidence in the same claim.
In  practice,  it  seems  unlikely  that  arguments  will  be
independent in this way, just as claims for independence
between  the  failure  behaviour  of  design-diverse  systems
are rarely believable. For two argument legs, each having
a particular level of confidence about the same claim, the
‘degree  of  dependence’  between  them  will  be  indicated
implicitly by the increase in confidence in the claim that
arises from using the two together.
Notice, however, that dependence need not be ‘a bad
thing’:  as  in  design  diversity  [11],  there  may  be  the
(theoretical) possibility for a kind of negative covariance
in argument diversity, resulting in confidence even greater
than would come from independence.
We can develop these ideas slightly more formally in
certain circumstances. Each argument leg can be thought
of  as  a  triple,  comprising  some  evidence  and  modelling
5 We intend to address in more detail in future work the parallels
between  system  and  arguments,  of  which  reliability/confidence  is  just
one instance
Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN’03)

assumptions that  together  support  a  claim or  assertion.
Associated with each triple will be a level of confidence in
the  claim  when  supported  by  the  evidence  and
assumptions.
Consider the situation of an argument leg A in which a
safety goal is expressed as an assertion, GA. For example:
(cid:120) GA:  ‘the  probability  of  failure  on  demand  of  the
protection system software is less than 10-3’.
Argument A is based upon some assumptions that
we call assA. An example might be:
