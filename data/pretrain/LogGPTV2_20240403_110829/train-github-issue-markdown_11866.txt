It would be great to enable the Fancy Zones to span across desktops. I have a
49 In Dell ultrawide monitor that that uses two video inputs to drive a single
display. The single display acts like two distinct monitors with the advantage
of not having a bezel in between since it is really one monitor. Enabling
monitor spanning of fancy zones would be super useful for people using wide
monitors that are driven by two video inputs.
This would enable you to make better use of your monitor enabling a zone right
in the middle of your screen. Currently, since a zone can't span two monitors,
I am unable to have a zone right in the center of my monitor.
I hope you choose to add this feature. I love PowerToys. I currently have to
use a janky Dell Monitor Utility to achieve this right now. PowerToys works a
lot better and I'd prefer to use it.
