the section where the required skills are listed. Moreover, we utilized SecPros

ities appear in the same profile (co-occurred), then they are important for each
other.
Test Data. For test purposes, we select the vulnerability discovery tasks (e.g.
Sony Vulnerability Discovery Program12) that are available on the HackerOne
platforms.Itisworthmentioninghere,thatduringclustergenerationwedidnot

3.2 Embedding Model
We utilized the embedding model (SecVuln) built for the cybersecurity domain
in our previous work [24]. However, to cope with the new terminologies in the
job advertisements, we enriched our previous model with information extracted
from job descriptions and resumes. We followed the same parameter settings as
reported in [24].

where a i denotes the average distance of skill i to other skills in the cluster,
whereas b i is the minimum of average distance of a skill b i to other skills of

Instead, Precision at N (P@N) is the percentage of relevant SecPros found at
the top N retrieved, ranked results (e.g. P@5 shows the total relevant SecPros
until 5).

compared to the baseline technique. The clustering technique has an advan-

this problem. Furthermore, our proposed approach offers the following advan-
tages:
Skills Representation. Skills representation can help educational institutions
to address the skills gap between industry and current curriculum offerings (as
these skills come from the ‘hands-on expertise’ of SecPros (ethical hackers)).
For instance, organizations like NIST have already initiated a program called
NICE (National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education)14 to fill the gap; they
can further leverage our work for improvement. Secondly, the organization can
also benefit from this pool of skills; for example, they can train their internal
security (testers) on a specific type of vulnerability like Web API vulnerability.
SecProsExpertiseRepresentation.Moreover,therepresentationofSecPros’
expertisecanhelpcrowdsourcingplatforms,afterlaunchingbugbountyprograms,
to directly contact SecPros (mapping between task and SecPro expertise) and
invitethemtoparticipate.
Limitations.Despiteitsadvantages,ourapproachhaslimitations.Forinstance,
to represent SecPros expertise, we rely on textual contents only, and moreover,
only one source (i.e. self-declared profiles on Cobalt) is taken into account. This
approach can be further improved by incorporating SecPros’ social activities
and their interactions on social networks (e.g. Twitter) [25] through network
embedding.
Regarding the computing of SecPro ranking in terms of their expertise, we
consider only one expertise signal (i.e. report quality on Cobalt). However, as
mentioned in [23], “expertise” is an umbrella term and comprises many signals
(e.g. SecPros certifications, platforms ranking, badges, hall of fame). Moreover,
[2]conductedacomprehensivestudyandfounddifferentindicatorssuchascerti-
ficationsandnumberofthevulnerabilitiesdiscoveredassignalsofSecProexper-
tise. Our work can leverage that study and add more signals for computing the
expertise.
SecPros data is scattered across the Web and different platforms provide
different information (expertise signals). For instance, HackerOne discloses the
reportssubmittedtotheirplatformfollowingtheirbugbountypolicy(notevery
organizationdisclosesitsreports).BugCrowd,ontheotherhand,providesinfor-
mation about the type and severity of vulnerabilities discovered by SecPros.
The key challenge here is to combine all those signals and information about a
specific SecPro from different platforms. However, the prevalence of social plat-
forms (LinkedIn and Twitter) and the presence of SecPros on these platforms

can mitigate this problem by using SecPros’ social identifiers to recognize them
on different platforms.
Moreover, we observed from experiments that the proposed clustering tech-
niqueispronetotheproblemofover-representationofusers’skillsandexpertise.
On the one hand, clustering helps in identifying any unspecified skills. However,
some clusters list skills which are not necessarily a substitution of skills. For
instance, the cluster defining the skills phrases indicates that there are different
techniques for finding vulnerabilities; they do not need to have knowledge of
all of them. As mentioned in [18], sometimes they prefer low hanging fruit and
finding vulnerabilities and utilize the tools they already have.

forms and general skills modeling techniques and draws on the insights offered
by previous works in regard to the selection of workers in security crowdsourced
platforms (bug bounty).
4.1 General Approaches for Skills Extraction and Representation
One of the most challenging tasks for any employer is the hiring of new people
from a large pool of job applications. [16] developed a system, Elisit (Expertise
LocalizationfromInformalSourcesandInformationTechnologies),thatperuses
data from Wikipedia and LinkedIn to extract skills from text documents. The
authorsclaimthattheirapproachcouldbeeasilyintegratedwithanyskillssearch
engine or HR automation in any automatic meta-data extraction systems.
However, the self-declared skills (e.g. those explicitly given in the LinkedIn
profile) may be incomplete or biased. To address this problem, [27] introduced
approaches to analyze individuals’ communication data (e.g. emails, discussion
forums) to infer their skills. [28] also utilized personal skill information derived
from social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) for skills inferences. They proposed a
joint prediction factor graph model to infer user skills automatically from their
connections on social networks.
Commercial Based Approaches.Severalworksaddresstheskillsrepresenta-
tionincommercialjobsearchportalsfortalentsearchusingtheirbuilt-insystems
[11,14]. Some of the works from notable job search portals (e.g. CareerBuilder
and LinkedIn) are described below.
CareerBuilder.Toovercomethe“skillgap”inthelabormarket,CareerBuilder
(US most prominent human capital solution) [14,30] presented an in-house skill
termsextractionsystem,SKILL,fortheextractionofkeywords(akaskills)from
both job descriptions and users’ resumes. More specifically, in this work [14],
theauthorsassumedthecontentsofindividuals’resumes(technicalsection)and
job ads (descriptions) as indicative of specific skills. They utilized a well-known
algorithm, Word2vec [20] with the assumption that related skills are likely to
344 S. Mumtaz et al.
appear in the same documents (resumes and job ads). For instance, “Python”
would always be a programming language in their system instead of a snake.
This work has achieved almost 91% accuracy and 76% recall, and the system is
successfully deployed in multiple business intelligence projects.
As an improvement on their previous work, the authors [32] quantified the
relevance of the skills to the job titles. To do so, they used a simple yet effec-
tive technique, TF-IDF (term frequency and inverse document frequency) [5],
to measure the skills-job title relationship, assuming that a particular skill is
important if it constitutes part of the job title.
In further work, they proposed a representation learning [7] to jointly rep-
resent job titles and skills in the same vector space for skills to skill similarity
via three networks/graphs (i.e. job skill graph, job transition graph, and skills
co-occurrencesgraph).Thesegraphareconstructedusingskills(nodes)fromthe
same resume. For example, an edge is formed between skills (e.g. Data mining
and Machine learning) if they both appear in the same resume. Likewise, they
extended this work and proposed [17] a tripartite vector representation of job
posting (i.e. job, skills and location) for a better job recommendation. The vec-
tor representation of job title and the skills required for that job are added to
a personalized vector for a specific position in one vector representation. Then,
this vector is further concatenated with the location vector, and is currently
being used within CareerBuilder.
LinkedIn. LinkedIn is the world’s largest professional online social network
with 500 million users profiles, indicating their professional identity. Their tal-
ent search system is widely used by job seekers and employers and generates
approximately 65% of company revenue [11]. LinkedIn presented [3] “Skills and
Expertise” feature as a part of their current system. They built a folksonomy
(often used for categorization of contents) using a data-driven approach.
Tofurtherimprovetheirin-housesystem,LinkedInintroducedanothertech-
nique [11] to address the problem of personalized expertise search. More specif-
ically, this work utilized collaborative filtering and matrix factorization tech-
niques to infer the member’ skills and expertise from the existing set of skills.
Next, they combined these skills with other personalized (e.g. location, social
connections)andnon-personalized(e.g.textualcontents)featurestorankmem-
bers accordingly against the query.
4.2 Workers (SecPro) Selection in Bug Bounty
As previously mentioned, bug bounty programs inherit all the properties of
crowdsourced platforms [19]. Hence, they have implemented the same strategies
for crowd/SecPro selection as those used by general crowdsourced platforms,
such as qualification tests [1] The qualification test is a pre-selection criterion
used to screen potential workers. It is used to assess the level of expertise of
SecPros before recruiting them for the real task of vulnerability discovery. Like
generalcrowdsourcedplatforms(e.g.AmazonMechanicalTurk),thebugbounty
platformsalsoaskSecProstocorrectlyanswerthequestionswithalready-known

solutions. For instance, [10] developed a conceptual expertise tool that relies on
a set of questions to distinguish a novice from an expert SecPros. However, it
relies on the self-declared skills and assessment of the expertise of the SecPro.
Similarly, Synack15, a crowdsourced vulnerability discovery platform, evaluates
the SecPros through written and practical tests to ensure that candidates are
eligible to join the platform. Likewise, Upwork16, an online freelancer market,
assessesthecompetencyofthefreelancerusingpriorknowledgelikecertification
and then determines the skills via online testing. Apart from the preliminary
tests, some organizations may also impose specific predefined criteria (e.g. eligi-
bility) for participation in the task. For instance, Mozilla bug bounty17 do not
allow their own employees to participate in any of their bug bounty programs.
Furthermore,someofthebugbountyplatforms(e.g.HackerOne,BugCrowd)

ing activities (e.g. number of vulnerabilities they have discovered, relative rank-
ing,andanyrewardtheyreceived)ontheplatforms.Afterlaunchingbugbounty
programs, organizations may invite the top SecPros (the top 100, for example)
to participate.
Several studies have been conducted for worker/people selection in general
crowdsourcing platforms. However, to the best of our knowledge, we did not
come across any such work for security crowdsourced platforms (bug bounty)
other than empirical studies. For example, [31] performed an empirical study to
determine the characteristics of SecPros. Their study focuses on the tools and
methods used by SecPros for discovering vulnerabilities and the type of vulner-
ability is common in the community. They determined how SecPros approach
vulnerability discovery task. However, their study did not explore the criteria
for SecPros’ expertise indicators to accomplish the task. On the other hand,
[12] investigated the heterogeneity among the SecPros participating in crowd-
sourcedvulnerabilitydiscoverytasks.Theauthorsdiscoveredthattherearetwo
different types of SecPros participating in crowdsourced vulnerability discovery.
Most SecPros are non-project-specific (i.e. submit vulnerabilities to multiple
tasks) and are different from traditional SecPros who work on specific projects
(i.e. submit vulnerabilities only to tasks that they are interested in making the
softwaresecure).However,unlikethepreviousapproaches,[1]conductedacom-
prehensiveempiricalstudytodetermineSecProsexpertiseindicatorstoimprove
the quality of software vulnerability discovery.
Keeping the limitations of previous works in mind, our study aimed to pro-
pose computational techniques for skills representation and task matching for
crowdsourced vulnerability discovery platforms and processes (bug bounty pro-
grams).

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we addressed the skills gap problem in the context of plat-
forms and processes for crowdsourced vulnerability discovery by proposing a
word embedding-based clustering method for skill representation. The key to
our approach is the representation of skills phrases and task keywords in the
same semantic space to minimize any differences and offer the best mapping
between them. To this end, by combining different and multiple skills-related
information, we create an embedding space that incorporates the syntactic and
semanticrelationshipbetweenskills,SecProsexpertiseandvulnerabilitydiscov-
ery tasks. The clustering algorithm further grouped them in semantically corre-
latedgroups.Furthermore,wehaveconductedexperimentsthatdemonstratethe
