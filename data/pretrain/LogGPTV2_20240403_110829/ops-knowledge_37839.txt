User: I've been looking around the internet for days now and cannot find a solution to my problem. I've learned all the basics to programming in Python 2.7 and I want to add Pip to my copy of 2.7. I found the link to download the unoffical 64-Bit installer (www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/), but when I downloaded it and ran it, it said I needed to have Python 2.7 (which I do) and it couldn't find it in the registry. I went to Pip's website and downloaded the official Windows installer and unpacked it using WinRAR. 
I then tried opening Command Prompt and changed the directory to where the get-pip.py is located and running get-pip.py install but it says it failed to install. 
I am completely lost and really need detailed and clear help. Please answer!
Assistant: It doesn't matter what kind of machine you have. You can run 32-bit Windows on a 64-bit machine. And you can run 32-bit Python on 64-bit Windows.
If you have 32-bit Python, you need to install 32-bit pip. (Or you need to switch to 64-bit Python.)
From your description, you most likely have 32-bit Python on 64-bit Windows, and tried to use a 64-bit pip.

PS, if you want to install it manually instead of using Gohlke's installer, nobody can help you debug your problem based on "it says it failed to install". It produces a lot more output than that, and without that output, it's impossible to know which of the billion things that could possibly go wrong actually did.
PPS, just installing pip is sufficient to install any pure-Python packages. But if you want to install packages that include C extensions, you will need to set up a compiler (either MSVC, or MinGW/gcc), as explained in the pip documentation.
