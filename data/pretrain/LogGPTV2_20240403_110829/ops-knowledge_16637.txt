Question: "Alice and Bob are using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange analogy involving colors to establish a shared secret. Evaluate the steps in their exchange process and select the statements that correctly reflect the security benefits and potential limitations of this analogy."
 "A": "The use of a publicly-known common color (green) as part of the exchange process adds a layer of security, as it prevents Eve from easily discerning the final shared secret color."
 "B": "If Eve manages to obtain the final shared secret color (green-amber-blue), she can reverse-engineer the secret colors chosen by Alice and Bob due to the properties of the paint mixing analogy."
 "C": "The analogy demonstrates that even if Eve can see the exchanged colors, without knowing the exact secret colors of Alice and Bob, she cannot derive the final shared secret color."
 "D": "Should Eve intercept the secret mixtures (green-amber and green-blue), she could potentially separate the mixtures into their original colors, compromising the security of the exchange."
Answer: AC
