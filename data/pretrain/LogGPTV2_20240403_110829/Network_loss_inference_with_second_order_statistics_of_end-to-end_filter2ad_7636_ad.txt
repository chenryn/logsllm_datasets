Figure 5: Accuracy of the LIA algorithm in locating
the congested links.
The real power of the method is in inferring not only the
locations of the congested links but also the link loss rates
as shown in Figure 6. In the ﬁgure, we plot the cumulative
distribution functions (CDFs) of the absolute errors (the
absolute values of the diﬀerences between the inferred loss
rates and their true values) and of the error factors (10) with
m = 50 snapshots. As we can see in the ﬁgure, both errors
are extremely small: the inferred values match almost ex-
actly the true values. These small errors are not only caused
by the sampling errors of end-to-end loss rates but also by
our approximation of the loss rates of links removed from
R (to obtain R∗) by 0. This type of error could be fatal if
some congested links (with non-negligible loss rates) are re-
moved because they aﬀect all equations of (3) in which they
appear. Fortunately, in all simulations R∗ always contains
the columns of all the congested links. Thus in our simu-
lation results, the errors introduced by this approximation
are small. We investigate the eﬀect of these approximation
errors further in Section 6.3.
6.2 Results for Mesh Topologies
We further evaluate our LIA algorithm on mesh topolo-
gies. We use diﬀerent mesh topologies generated by BRITE [21]

(WAXMAN, Barabasi-Albert and Hierarchical) with 1000
nodes, the PlanetLab topology [34] with 500 beacons, 14922
distinct links collected on the 15th of July, 2006, and the
DIMES [33] topology with 801 beacons and 35067 distinct
links collected from May to July, 2006.
In the simulated
topology, end-hosts are nodes with the least out-degree. In
PlanetLab and DIMES topologies all end-hosts are given.
Both DIMES and PlanetLab are real Internet topologies.
Most of the DIMES hosts are located in the commercial In-
ternet, contrary to most of the PlanetLab hosts that reside
in Universities and research organizations.
In all simula-
tions, the end-hosts are both beacons and probing destina-
tions. The link loss model is LLRD1 with p = 10% congested
links. We use the default values m = 50 and S = 1000. The
results are reported in Table 2. Each entry in the table is
an average of 10 runs. We omit the conﬁdent intervals for
clarity reasons.
The results conﬁrm that the LIA algorithm achieves high
accuracies in all topologies. This is understandable as the al-
gorithm provably can work with all topologies (Theorem 1).
On some topologies such as the BRITE hierarchical topolo-
gies or the DIMES topology, LIA performs less well than on
other topologies. These inaccuracies are the results of the
approximation in (9). Note however that in all topologies
the link variances are learnt exactly.
The ratio between the number of congested links and the
number of columns of R∗ is shown in Figure 7. We could
see clearly that the number of congested links is always
smaller than the number of columns in R∗. As we remove
columns of R until we reach a full column rank matrix R∗,

Figure 7: Ratio between the number of congested
links (pnc) and the number of columns of R remain-
ing in R∗. In all topologies, this ratio is always below
1.
this means that we reach a full rank matrix R∗ by only re-
moving columns of un-congested links. Hence, our approach
that ﬁrst calculates the links variances and then solves (9)
is appropriate as it does not assign zero loss rates to any
congested link.
6.3 Effect of p and S
In this section, we explore the inﬂuences of the percentage
of congested links p and the number of probes S on the
accuracy of the LIA algorithm. We run simulations on the
PlanetLab network with m = 50 snapshots. In Figure 8.a,
we plot the DR and FPR of the LIA algorithm in locating
congested links when varying p from 5% to 25% with S =
1000. In Figure 8.b we plot the DR and FPR of the LIA
when varying S from 200 to 1000 with p = 10%.
As p increases, the link variances v can still be learnt
precisely, as proved in Section 4. However, when p is large,
some of the congested links may need to be removed from
R to obtain R∗ in (9). As a consequence, the accuracies
of our LIA algorithm in calculating link loss rates, hence in
locating congested links, degrade as p grows. When S is
small, sampling errors of end-to-end loss rates φ also aﬀect
the accuracy of LIA. The impact of S, however, is less severe.
6.4 Running Time
In all of our simulations, the time needed to solve (3) is
in the order of milliseconds, whereas the time required to
solve (9) is about 10 times longer. These running times are
