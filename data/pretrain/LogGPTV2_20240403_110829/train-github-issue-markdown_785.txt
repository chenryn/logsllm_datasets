There is another bug by the same name, but that one was fixed. After searching
about 10 minutes, I couldn't find any duplicates.
The code
    fn main () {
        let arr: ~[u8] = ~[ 1, 2, 3 ];
        let iter = &arr.iter() as &Iterator
    }
Fails to compile with the following error
    task 'rustc' failed at 'index out of bounds: the len is 1 but the index is 1', /home/username/dload/code/rust/src/librustc/middle/ty.rs:1432
    error: internal compiler error: unexpected failure
    This message reflects a bug in the Rust compiler. 
    We would appreciate a bug report: https://github.com/mozilla/rust/wiki/HOWTO-submit-a-Rust-bug-report
    note: the compiler hit an unexpected failure path. this is a bug
    note: try running with RUST_LOG=rustc=1 to get further details and report the results to github.com/mozilla/rust/issues
    task '' failed at 'explicit failure', /home/username/dload/code/rust/src/librustc/lib.rs:398
