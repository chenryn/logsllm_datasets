**Abstract:**
Traditional service monitoring approaches primarily focus on Quality of Service (QoS) attributes. However, for business services, this is insufficient. It is also essential to consider business-level aspects. In this paper, we discuss the specific attributes of business services and present an approach to describing both technical and business aspects of services. We then discuss the requirements for business service monitoring and identify several research questions that need to be addressed.

### 1. Introduction

Enterprise service applications are increasingly adopting service-oriented architectures (SOA), where services are viewed as building blocks for applications. The vision of the Internet of Services (IoS) takes this a step further by making services available as tradable goods via the internet. These services include not only web services but also business services. A business service is a business activity provided by a provider to a consumer to create value for the consumer. In traditional economies, business services are typically discovered, selected, and invoked manually, but their realization may be performed through automated or manual means. In the IoS vision, while these services are accessible via the internet, they are often executed manually in the real world.

One of the key challenges in the IoS is the monitoring of services based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Traditional monitoring approaches focus on QoS attributes, which are not sufficient for business services. Business services require monitoring at both the technical and business levels. This paper explores the differences between technical and business services and discusses the challenges associated with their monitoring requirements.

### 2. Why Service Monitoring is a Hard Undertaking?

Services currently govern economies and will undoubtedly become even more significant in the near future. This trend is supported by the European Commission's proposal for a Directive on Services in the Internal Market, which aims to increase the market share of services by reducing regulation-based barriers to trade.

While monitoring IT services (such as WSDL or REST Web services) is primarily seen as a technological problem, the monitoring of business services adds the requirement of also monitoring business aspects. IT service monitoring typically focuses on network attributes such as latency, packet loss, throughput, link utilization, availability, connectivity, one-way delay, one-way packet loss, round-trip delay, delay variation, and bulk transfer capacity. Moser et al. [13] recognize that Web services currently lack monitoring mechanisms and provide a solution based on the interception of SOAP messages exchanged during runtime, with an emphasis on technical aspects.

In contrast, the monitoring of business services must address the business level and account for organizations' strategies. Compared to IT monitoring, business monitoring is more complex because services are intangible, often inseparable, immersive, and bipolar.

1. **Intangible**: Services do not have material existence, making it difficult to create suitable standards to model them and define attributes to objectively measure them.
2. **Inseparable**: The execution and consumption of services often occur in parallel, implying a rigorous match between supply and demand. Otherwise, services are "lost," or consumers are queued and need to wait for service availability.
3. **Immersive**: Services are often executed in collaboration with consumers, making it difficult to determine the parties responsible for the success or failure of a service.
4. **Bipolar**: Services are often executed by a blend of human and technological resources. While techniques to monitor purely technological resources are available, solutions to monitor human involvement and the complex relationship between human and technological dimensions have not been studied in the context of business services.

These characteristics and requirements bring a new set of challenges for the monitoring of business services. To better understand the important monitoring aspects that need to be considered for the IoS, ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) recommendations provide a set of best practices for effective service monitoring. These include service level management, availability management, capacity management, financial management, and service continuity management. The multi-level management proposed by ITIL brings a set of requirements that need to be fulfilled by business service monitoring. For example, there is a need to monitor the performance of business processes and their functions and to understand the impact of service disruptions on business strategies. This is challenging since different business services may use the same infrastructure, making it difficult to understand their impact on workloads and track service resource usage. This problem is accentuated because business services are bipolar.

### 3. The Service Description Framework

The first step in enabling the development of technological infrastructures to monitor business services for the IoS is to study how the most relevant characteristics and particularities of business services can be abstracted and formally modeled. Such an abstraction will enable the formalization and normalization of the intangible, inseparable, immersive, and bipolar nature of real-world services. Therefore, this section presents a conceptual structure to model business services.

The service description framework is a result of literature research, including the following works:
1. PAS 1018 [12]
2. IEEE 830:1998 [17]
3. O’Sullivan’s service properties [15]
4. Dublin Core Elements [1]
5. QoS taxonomy [4]

For a better understanding and reduction of complexity, similar properties are grouped into facets. Figure 1 depicts the nine service facets. Each attribute applies to a specific type or metric, which is not shown here.

- **General Information**: Covers self-evident attributes of a service such as Title, Identifier, Creator, Provider, Dates, and Version.
- **Functionality**: Provides the service consumer with an understanding of what can be expected from the service. Attributes include Functions, Classifications such as eCl@ss, and Benefits.
- **Business**: Comprises monetary and marketing-related attributes, including the Price of a service, available Payment methods, Discounts, and the Delivery Unit stating how services are packaged and provided to service consumers (e.g., single use, monthly fee).
- **Service Interaction**: Covers attributes describing agents' interactions with services. User Interface describes graphical form elements to interact with a human agent. Message Exchange Pattern depicts the interchange of messages between two agents. Protocol refers to the protocol to be used to access the service’s functionality.
- **Legal**: Groups lawfulness attributes stating services’ terms of use. Right states what service consumers and providers are allowed to do with respect to the service. Obligation states the commitment of involved parties. Penalty implies a reparation imposed on any party in the case of violating obligations or rights.
- **Security and Trust**: Security measures ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information and processes. Attributes include Authentication and Encryption. Trust is concerned with a service’s overall reputation and is represented by Escrow and Insurance of Payment.
- **Rating**: Reflects opinions on services’ performance from other parties. Attributes include Community Rating, Expert Test Rating, and Certifications.
- **Data**: Groups information with respect to which Business Objects (representation of entities from the business domain) are relevant.

This structured approach to service description will facilitate the development of more effective and comprehensive monitoring mechanisms for business services in the IoS.
