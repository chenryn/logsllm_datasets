User: Just like I ask in the title
I try to run "python a.py" in cmd but it says no such file or directory
"python E:\python\python2.79\a.py" can run..
..I am a newbie in python...I will appeciate for your answers
Assistant: It seems like you are not in the same directory as a.py. If so, you will need the absolute path rather than the relative path. That is probably why python (location of a.py) runs but python a.py will not. Make sure that you are running a.py from the same directory as you saved it in.
