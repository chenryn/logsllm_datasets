**What happened** :  
I have ingress running as a daemonset, looking for a nodeSelector:
          nodeSelector:
            roles.kubernetes.io/node: "1"
I am updating it to have a TCP services config map, so I needed to delete the
daemonset first.  
Ran: `kubectl delete ds nginx-ingress-controller --namespace=kube-system`  
And waited.
Eventually, it failed with `error: timed out waiting for the condition`
But `kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system -w` shows that the pods are
being terminated, and then being recreated.
**What you expected to happen** :  
All pods and the daemonset should be deleted.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
I have no idea.
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
Not sure.
