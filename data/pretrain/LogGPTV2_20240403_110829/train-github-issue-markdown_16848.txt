### Follow-up to Issue #12601

**Type of Request:**
- [x] Feature Request

**Current Behavior:**
Currently, components need to manually traverse the router tree to access parameters defined within it. This requires each component to have detailed knowledge about the router configuration, which can lead to tightly coupled and less maintainable code.

**Expected Behavior:**
The proposed enhancement would provide a flattened view of the router parameters, making them accessible to components without requiring them to understand the router tree structure. This would allow components to be agnostic of the router configuration when retrieving parameter values.

**Motivation / Use Case:**
This change would benefit components that use `ActivatedRoute` by enabling them to easily find all parameters defined in the route, regardless of how nested routers are configured. This decoupling would improve the modularity and maintainability of the application.

**Angular Version:**
- 2.0.X
