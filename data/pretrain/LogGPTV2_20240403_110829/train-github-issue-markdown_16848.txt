This is a follow up to #12601. Basically, I'd like to find a way to have a
flattened view of router params available to components so that each
components need not know about how the router tree has been configured. See
#12601 for an implementation idea.

**Current behavior**
Components would need to manually traverse the tree in order to find
parameters defined in router tree.
**Expected behavior**
Components can now be incognizant of the router configuration when finding
parameter values.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
This helps the components consuming ActivatedRoute finding all the parameters
defined in the  
route, decoupling them from the knowledge of how nested routers are
configured.
