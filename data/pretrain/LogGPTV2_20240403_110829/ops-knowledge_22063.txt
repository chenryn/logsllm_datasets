User: What is CI/CD? What are their differences and connections?
Assistant: CI/CD refers to Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment. They are an essential part of the DevOps practice, which aims to automate and continue the software development process. Continuous integration refers to the integration of code into a shared code base during the development process, and automated construction, testing, and analysis to ensure the quality and stability of all code. Its goal is to detect and fix problems early to reduce costs and risks later. Continuous delivery/deployment refers to the automatic deployment of tested code to the production environment, so that new features and updates can be delivered to end users more quickly. Its goal is to shorten the release cycle, improve product reliability and user satisfaction. They are linked in that they are both key practices for automation and continuity in DevOps. Continuous integration is the premise of continuous delivery/deployment. It can ensure the quality and reliability of code, and provide guarantee for subsequent deployment and delivery. Continuous delivery/deployment is an extension of continuous integration, which enables rapid updates and releases, allowing new features and updates to reach end users faster. The difference between them is that continuous integration mainly focuses on code building and testing, while continuous delivery/deployment focuses more on the automation of code release and deployment.
