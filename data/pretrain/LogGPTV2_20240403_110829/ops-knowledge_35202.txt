It appears that you encountered the following error while attempting to import a module from PyBrain:

```
ImportError: No module named pybrain.structure
```

This occurred when you executed the following line of code, as per the PyBrain tutorial:

```python
from pybrain.pybrain.structure import FeedForwardNetwork
```

You mentioned that you installed PyBrain using the command:

```
sudo python setup.py install
```

The issue was resolved by modifying the import statement. Instead of:

```python
from pybrain.pybrain.structure import FeedForwardNetwork
```

you should use:

```python
from pybrain.structure import FeedForwardNetwork
```

This change corrects the import path, and the `FeedForwardNetwork` class can now be imported correctly.
