User: I'm getting that error:
ImportError: No module named pybrain.structure
When executing:

from pybrain.pybrain.structure import FeedForwardNetwork

From the pybrain tutorial.
I installed pybrain running:
sudo python setup.py install
Assistant: The problem was resolved replacing pybrain.pybrain by pybrain.
