User: Where can I learn about controlling/interrogating the network interface under Linux? I'd like to get specific application upload/download speeds, and enforce a speed limit for a specific application. 
I'd particularly like information that can help me write a traffic shaping application using Python.
Assistant: Is there any reason you wish to use python? As mentioned, it will likely only hand-off to already developed tools for this purpose. However, if you look around, you can find things such as Click! modular router, XORP, and others that provide a drop-in for things you want to do - not to mention all the suggestions already provided (such as iptables and tc)
