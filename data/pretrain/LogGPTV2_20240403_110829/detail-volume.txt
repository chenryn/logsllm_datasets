### Detail Volume

**Description:**
The `detail volume` command displays the disks on which the current volume resides. Before using this command, you must first select a volume. Use the `select volume` command to choose a volume and shift the focus to it. Note that this command is not applicable to read-only volumes, such as DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drives.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
detail volume
```

**Examples:**
To view all the disks associated with the current volume, enter:
```plaintext
detail volume
```

**Steps to Use:**
1. **Select a Volume:**
   - Use the `select volume` command to choose the volume you want to inspect.
   ```plaintext
   select volume <volume_number>
   ```
2. **Display Disk Details:**
   - Once the volume is selected, use the `detail volume` command to see the disks on which the volume resides.
   ```plaintext
   detail volume
   ```

**Note:**
- Ensure that the volume you select is not a read-only volume (e.g., DVD-ROM, CD-ROM) as the `detail volume` command does not apply to these types of media.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `detail volume` command to gather detailed information about the disks associated with the selected volume.
