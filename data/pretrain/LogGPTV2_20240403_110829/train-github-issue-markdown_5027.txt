### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
The `npm audit --production` command includes vulnerabilities of transitive
devDependencies in its report. Using @thiagoelg/node-printer as an example, a
vulnerability is reported for `diff` if @thiagoelg/node-printer is declared as
a dependency. But `diff` is not installed by `npm install --production`,
because it is a transitive dependency of nodeunit, which is a devDependency of
@thiagoelg/node-printer.
### Expected Behavior
    found 0 vulnerabilities
### Steps To Reproduce
    npm init -y
    npm install --save @thiagoelg/node-printer@^0.5.5
    npm audit --production
### Output
    # npm audit report
    diff  =0.9.3
