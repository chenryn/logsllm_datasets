User: How to get list opened windows in PyGTK or GTK  or other programming language? in Ubuntu?
edit:
i want get list paths opened directories on desktop!
Assistant: I really don't know how to check if a window is a GTK one. But if you want to check how many windows are currently open try "wmctrl -l". Install it first of course.
