### How to Get a List of Opened Directories on the Desktop in Ubuntu

**Question:**
How can I get a list of currently opened directories (file manager windows) on the desktop using PyGTK, GTK, or any other programming language in Ubuntu?

**Clarification:**
I want to retrieve a list of paths for the directories that are currently open on the desktop.

**Answer:**

To achieve this, you can use a combination of command-line tools and scripting. While PyGTK and GTK are primarily used for creating graphical user interfaces, they do not directly provide a way to list open directories. However, you can use the `wmctrl` tool to get a list of open windows and then filter out the ones that are file manager windows (e.g., Nautilus).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Install `wmctrl`:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install wmctrl
   ```

2. **Use `wmctrl` to List Open Windows:**
   You can use the `wmctrl -l` command to list all open windows. This will give you a list of window IDs and their titles.

   ```sh
   wmctrl -l
   ```

3. **Filter Out File Manager Windows:**
   To filter out the windows that are file manager windows (e.g., Nautilus), you can use `grep` to search for specific keywords in the window titles.

   ```sh
   wmctrl -l | grep -i "nautilus"
   ```

4. **Retrieve the Path from the Window Title:**
   The window title often contains the path of the directory being viewed. You can extract this path using `awk` or `sed`.

   ```sh
   wmctrl -l | grep -i "nautilus" | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

5. **Integrate with Python (Optional):**
   If you prefer to use Python, you can call these commands and process the output. Here is an example script:

   ```python
   import subprocess

   def get_open_directories():
       # Run the wmctrl command and capture the output
       result = subprocess.run(['wmctrl', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
       output = result.stdout.decode('utf-8')

       # Filter out the Nautilus windows and extract the paths
       directories = []
       for line in output.splitlines():
           if 'Nautilus' in line:
               # Extract the path from the window title
               path = line.split(None, 4)[-1]
               directories.append(path)

       return directories

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       open_directories = get_open_directories()
       for dir_path in open_directories:
           print(dir_path)
   ```

This script will list the paths of the directories currently open in Nautilus. You can adapt it to work with other file managers by changing the keyword in the `if 'Nautilus' in line:` condition.

By following these steps, you can effectively retrieve a list of open directories on the desktop in Ubuntu.
