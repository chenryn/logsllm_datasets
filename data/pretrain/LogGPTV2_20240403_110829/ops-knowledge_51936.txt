User: i am using google app engine for fetching the feed url bur few of the urls are 301 redirect i want to get the final url which returns me the result
i am usign the universal feed reader for parsing the url is there any way or any function which can give me the final url.
Assistant: You can do this by handling redirects manually. When calling fetch, pass in follow_redirects=False. If your response object's HTTP status is a redirect code, either 301 or 302, grab the Location response header and fetch again until the HTTP status is something else. Add a sanity check (perhaps 5 redirects max) to avoid redirect loops.
