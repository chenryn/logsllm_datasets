User: An application needs to use a CPU-intensive algorithm, but the use of too many CPU resources causes other applications to slow down. Please provide a reasonable load balancing solution.
Assistant: You can use CPU affinity binding techniques to bind CPU-intensive algorithms to certain CPU cores in the system and other applications to other cores. The specific implementation method is to use the taskset command in the Linux system or the Set Process Affinity API function in the Windows system to set. In this way, resource competition between CPU cores can be effectively avoided, application program running efficiency can be improved, and other application programs can be guaranteed to run normally.
