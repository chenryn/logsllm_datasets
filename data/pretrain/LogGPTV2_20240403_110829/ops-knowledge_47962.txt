User: Is there a command in Eclipse Pydev which allows me to only run a few selected (highlighted) lines of code within a larger script?
If not, is it possible to run multiple lines of code in the PyDev console at once?
Assistant: press CTRL+ALT+ENTER to send the selected lines to the interactive console
