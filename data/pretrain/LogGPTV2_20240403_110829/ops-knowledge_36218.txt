**User:** I would like to download all blobs as a single zipped file (or in another format) to my computer. Is there a way to do that? I am using the Python SDK.

**Assistant:** One approach you can take is to copy the blobs to Google Cloud Storage and then use the `gsutil` command-line tool to download them. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Copy Blobs to Google Cloud Storage:**
   - Use the Azure Blob Storage Python SDK to list and copy each blob to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
   - You can use the `google-cloud-storage` library to upload the blobs to your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

2. **Download the Blobs Using `gsutil`:**
   - Once the blobs are in Google Cloud Storage, you can use the `gsutil` command to download them. For example, to download all blobs in a bucket to a local directory, you can run:
     ```sh
     gsutil -m cp -r gs://your-bucket-name/ /local/directory/
     ```

3. **Zip the Downloaded Files (Optional):**
   - If you need the files in a single zipped file, you can use the `zip` command or a Python script to zip the downloaded files. For example:
     ```sh
     zip -r /path/to/output.zip /local/directory/
     ```

Alternatively, if you prefer to keep the process entirely within Azure, you can use the Azure Blob Storage Python SDK to download the blobs and then zip them locally. Here’s a brief outline:

1. **List and Download Blobs:**
   - Use the `list_blobs` method to get a list of all blobs in the container.
   - Download each blob to a local directory using the `download_blob` method.

2. **Zip the Local Directory:**
   - Use the `zipfile` module in Python to create a zipped file from the downloaded blobs.

Would you like a code example for either of these approaches?

This version provides a clear, step-by-step guide and offers both options: using Google Cloud Storage with `gsutil` and keeping the process within Azure.
