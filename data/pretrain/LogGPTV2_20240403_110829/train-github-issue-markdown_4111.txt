## Expected Behavior
## Current Behavior
I'm struggling to figure out how to duplicate this locally, but I was using
`3.0.0-beta9` and upgraded to `4.1` (including upgrading to react 16) and now
I get this when I use fetch as google or google's page speed test. I narrowed
it down to happening sometime between the 3.0 beta and upgrading to next
`3.2.1`

I'm worried that it's causing SEO issues. Has anyone else run into this issue?
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
