able to large networks. RapidChain uses a distributed ledger design that partitions the blockchain
across several committees along with several key improvements that result in signiﬁcantly-higher
transaction throughput and lower latency. RapidChain handles seamlessly churn introducing mini-
mum changes across committee membership without aﬀecting transaction latency. Our system also
features several improved protocols for fast gossip of large messages and inter-committee routing.
Finally, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that RapidChain scales smoothly to network sizes
of up to 4,000 nodes showing better performance than previous work.
