 **Describe the feature** :  
Add date math support to the field stats API. The ability to do something like
this could be useful:
    GET metricbeat-*/_field_stats?level=indices
    {
      "fields": ["@timestamp"],
      "index_constraints": {
        "@timestamp": {
          "max_value": {
            "lt":"now-30d"
          }
        }
      }
    }
It could help with managing time series indices. Other uses?
