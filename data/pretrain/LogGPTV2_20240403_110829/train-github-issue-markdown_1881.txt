**Current behavior**
Just press `a` in the search field to get a list of options and then press
down key. The selected result is constantly reset. Selecting one will keep the
single result open.
**Expected/desired behavior**
Here's a version of the plunkr without `angular2-polyfills.js` to show the

Any insights in why just including `angular2-polyfills.js` causes this

to simply including `angular2-polyfills.js`
