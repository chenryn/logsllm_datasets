ABSTRACT
A broad range of research areas including Internet measurement,
privacy, and network security rely on lists of target domains to be
analysed; researchers make use of target lists for reasons of neces-
sity or efficiency. The popular Alexa list of one million domains is
a widely used example. Despite their prevalence in research papers,
the soundness of top lists has seldom been questioned by the com-
munity: little is known about the lists’ creation, representativity,
potential biases, stability, or overlap between lists.
In this study we survey the extent, nature, and evolution of top
lists used by research communities. We assess the structure and
stability of these lists, and show that rank manipulation is possible
for some lists. We also reproduce the results of several scientific
studies to assess the impact of using a top list at all, which list
specifically, and the date of list creation. We find that (i) top lists
generally overestimate results compared to the general population
by a significant margin, often even an order of magnitude, and (ii)
some top lists have surprising change characteristics, causing high
day-to-day fluctuation and leading to result instability. We conclude
our paper with specific recommendations on the use of top lists,
and how to interpret results based on top lists with caution.

1 INTRODUCTION
Scientific studies frequently make use of a sample of DNS domain
names for various purposes, be it to conduct lexical analysis, to
measure properties of domains, or to test whether a new algorithm
works on real domains. Internet top lists, such as the Alexa or Cisco
Umbrella Top 1M lists, serve the purpose of providing a reputedly
representative sample of Internet domains in popular use. These
top lists can be created with different methods and data sources,
resulting in different sets of domains.
The prevalence and opacity of these lists could have introduced
an unchecked bias in science—for 10 networking venues in 2017
alone, we count 69 publications that use a top list. This potential
bias is based on the fact that curators of such top lists commonly
conceal the data sources and ranking mechanism behind those lists,
which are typically seen as a proprietary business asset in the search
engine optimisation (SEO) space [4]. This leaves researchers using
those lists with little to no information about content, stability,
biases, evolution and representativity of their contents.
In this work, we analyse three popular top lists—Alexa Global [1],
Cisco Umbrella [2], and Majestic Million [3]—and discuss the fol-
lowing characteristics:
Significance: In a survey of 687 networking-related papers pub-
lished in 2017, we investigate if, to what extent, and for what pur-
pose, these papers make use of Internet top lists. We find that 69
papers (10.0%) make use of at least one top list (cf., §3).
Structure: Domain properties in different top lists, such as the
surprising amount of invalid top-level domains (TLDs), low inter-
sections between various lists (<30%), and classifications of disjunct
domains, are investigated in §5.
Stability: We conduct in-depth longitudinal analyses of top list
stability in §6, revealing daily churn of up to 50% of domains.
Ranking Mechanisms: Through controlled experiments and
reverse engineering of the Alexa toolbar, we shed light on the
ranking mechanisms of different top lists. In one experiment, we
place an unused test domain at a 22k rank in Umbrella (cf., §7).
Research Result Impact: Scientific studies that use top lists for
Internet research measure characteristics of the targets contained
in each list, or the related infrastructure. To show the bias inherent
in any given target list, we run several experiments against top lists
and the general population of all com/net/org domains. We show
that top lists significantly exaggerate results, and that results even
depend on the day of week a list was obtained (cf., §8).

3 SIGNIFICANCE OF TOP LISTS
Scientific literature often harnesses one or more of the top lists out-
lined in §2. To better understand how often and to what purpose top
lists are used by the literature, we survey 687 recent publications.

2 DOMAIN TOP LISTS
This section provides an overview of various domain top lists and
their creation process. Each of these lists is updated daily.
Alexa: The most popular and widely used top list is the Alexa
Global Top 1M list [1]. It is generated based on web activity moni-
tored by the Alexa browser plugin1, “directly measured sources” [6]
and “over 25,000 different browser extensions” [7] over the past
three months [8] from “millions of people” [6]. No information
exists on the plugin’s user base, which opens questions on potential
biases in terms of, e.g., geography or age of its user base. Alexa
lists are generally offered for sale, with few free offerings. Paid
offerings include top lists per country, industry, or region. The
Global Top 1M list is the most popular free offering, available with
no explicit license, and was briefly suspended in late 2016.
Cisco Umbrella: Another popular top list is the Cisco Umbrella
1M, a top list launched in mid-December 2016. This list contains
the Top 1M domains (including subdomains) as seen by Cisco’s
OpenDNS service [2]. This DNS-based nature is fundamentally
different from collecting website visits or links. Hence, the Umbrella
list contains Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) for any kind
of Internet service, not just web sites as in the case of Alexa or
Majestic. Without explicit license, it is provided “free of charge”.
Majestic: The third top list is the Majestic Million [3], released
in October 2012. This creative commons licensed list is based on
Majestic’s web crawler. It ranks sites by the number of /24 IPv4-
subnets linking to that site [9]. This is yet another data collection
methodology and, similar to Alexa, heavily web-focused. While
the Majestic list is currently not widely used in research, we still
include it in our study for its orthogonal mechanism, its explicitly
open license, and its availability for several years.
Other Top Lists: There are few other top lists available, but as
those are little used, not consistently available, or fluctuate in size,
we will not investigate them in detail in this paper. Quantcast [10]
provides a list of the Top 1M most frequently visited websites per
country, measured through their web intelligence plugin on sites.
Only the US-based list can be downloaded; all other lists can only
be viewed online and show ranks only when paid. The Statvoo [11]
list provides an API and a download for their Top 1M sites, but has
frequently been inaccessible in the months before this publication.
Statvoo does not offer insights about the metrics they use in their
creation process. The Chrome UX report [12] publishes telemetry
data about domains popular with Chrome users. It does not, how-
ever, rank domains or provide a static-sized set of domains. We also
exclude the SimilarWeb Top Sites ranking [13] as it is not available
for free and little used in science.

3.1 Methodology
We survey papers published at 10 network-related venues in 2017,
listed in Table 1. First, we search the 687 papers published at these
venues for keywords2 in an automated manner. Next, we inspect
matching papers manually to remove false positives (e.g., Amazon’s
Alexa home assistant, or an author named Alexander), or papers
that mention the lists without actually using them as part of a study.
Finally, we reviewed the remaining 69 papers (10.0%) that made
use of a top list, with various aims in mind: to understand the
top lists used (§3.2), the nature of the study and the technologies
measured (§3.3), whether the study was dependent on the list for its
results (§3.4), and whether the study was possibly replicable (§3.5).
Table 1 provides an overview of the results.
We find the field of Internet measurement to be most reliant on
top lists, used in 22.2% of the surveyed papers. Other fields also use
top lists frequently, such as security (8.5%), systems (6.4%) and web
technology (7.9%).
3.2 Top Lists Used
We first investigate which lists and what subsets of lists are typically
used; Table 1 provides an overview of lists used in the studies we
identified. We find 29 studies using the full Alexa Global Top 1M,
the most common choice among inspected publications, followed
by a surprising variety of Alexa Top 1M subsets (e.g., Top 10k).
All papers except one [69] use a list collated by Alexa. This paper
instead uses the Umbrella Top 100 list to assess importance of ASes
showing BGP bursts. No paper in our study used the Majestic list.
A study may also use multiple distinct subsets of a list. For
example, one study uses the Alexa Global Top 1k, 10K, 500K and
Top 1M at different stages of the study [61]. We count these as
distinct use-cases in the right section of Table 1.
We also find that 59 studies exclusively use Alexa as a source
for domain names. Ten papers use lists from more than one origin;
one paper uses the Alexa Global Top 1M, the Umbrella Top 1M, and
various DNS zone files as sources [21]. In total, two studies make
use of the Cisco Umbrella Top 1M [21, 67].
Category and country-specific lists are also being used: eight
studies use country-specific lists from Alexa, usually choosing only
one country; one study selected 138 countries [26]. Category-based
lists are rarer still: two studies made use of category subsets [17, 71].
3.3 Characterisation of Studies
To show that top lists are used for various types of studies, we look
at the range of topics covered and technologies measured in our
surveyed papers. For each paper we assigned a broad purpose, and
the network layer in focus.
Purposes: For all papers, we reviewed the broad area of study.
The largest category we identified encompasses various aspects
2Those being: “alexa”, “umbrella”, and “majestic”
