 **Proof of concept** : https://github.com/Bladrak/symfony-standard (master
branch)
  * Go to {host}/demo/test
  * Enter anything in the form
  * Submit
The error message appears twice.
**Expected result** : the message should appear only once.
**Model** : The validation is set on the interface (TestModelInterface) ; the
interface is implemented by a class (TestModel) which is overridden by our
target entity for the validation (OverriddenTestModel).
**Possible bug sources** :
  * `Symfony\Component\Validator\Mapping\ClassMetadata::mergeConstraints` method systematically performs `addConstraint` on class-levels constraints where it may have to check if that constraint is already present.
  * `Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraint\ElementMetadata::addConstraint` method could perform the check as well.
