WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS CHAPTER:
-   [CIS Basic Controls---The Top Six]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0001}
As an educator, I firmly believe that humans have to know the "why" to
accept change. Most of us are curious creatures of habit and do not
change unless sufficiently motivated. Most of us are motivated by either
the love of something or the fear of it. In our cyber society, people
need to know why certain controls are important, and they have to
understand why they are important on a personal level. Knowing something
and understanding it are very different. As a cybersecurity trainer, it
is my personal mission to educate the public and bring understanding to
cyber threats in a personal way. I believe we have to hope for the best
but prepare for the worst.
When you are evaluating and auditing your environment for managing your
processes and systems, you should determine whether the options you are
following are the best practices of conducting inventories, adopting
computer policy, and communicating to the people using those systems.
You also have to evaluate whether people in the management roles have
the practical and technical expertise to assess these options and can
provide support and training for users.
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) is a self‐described
forward‐thinking, nonprofit entity dedicated to protecting private
domains and public society against cyber threats. The controls they
publish are the global standard and are the recognized best practices
for security. As our cyber worries evolve, so do these best practices.
As a cybersecurity professional, I refer to these CIS top 20 controls
fairly often as a reminder to secure the world to the best of my
ability.
[]{#c15.xhtml#Page_236 .pagebreak title="236" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
CIS top 20 controls are broken into three sections. The first six
controls are the basic ones. These six controls are essential in any
organization for cyber defense. The rest of the controls are divided
into foundational and organizational, which focus on technical best
practices and processes.

## CIS Basic Controls---The Top Six {#c15.xhtml#head-2-108}
I recommend that you go to the SANS website, `www.sans.org`, and look
for conferences that are happening near you. In the evenings, they will
have mini‐sessions free to the public, usually about an hour long each,
of interesting security topics taught by the certified SANS instructors.
Sometimes, if you\'re lucky, they will have an assortment and up to
three or four in one evening. In the dozens of sessions I\'ve attended,
the one that stands out the most is the one Eric Conrad did a couple
years ago in Orlando, Florida. He talked about the top six CIS controls.
He said that while he was consulting for a governmental organization on
another continent, implementing the top six controls negated about 80
percent of the problems resulting in more security and less likelihood
of a breach.
The top six CISv7 basic controls are as follows:
-   [Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0002}
-   [Inventory and Control of Software Assets]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0003}
-   [Continuous Vulnerability Management]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0004}
-   [Controlled Use of Administrative
    Privileges]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0005}
-   [Secure Configuration for Hardware and Software on Mobile Devices,
    Laptops, Workstations, and Servers]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0006}
-   [Maintenance, Monitoring, and Analysis of Audit
    Logs]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0007}
If you read about the major breaches in the last five years, most of
them could have been avoided if the organization had subscribed to and
executed these six controls. The CISv7 controls have cross‐compatibility
or directly map to other cyber compliance and security standards like
NIST 800‐53, PCI DSS, and HIPAA. This translates to other organizations
using these suggestions as regulations to aid in their respective
compliance. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is another tool that
organizations use to organize and strengthen their security posture
using the CIS top controls as their baseline for several of their best
practices. Let\'s look at these in more detail.

### Inventory and Control of Hardware Assets {#c15.xhtml#head-3-14}
One of my favorite sayings in class is that "you cannot protect what you
don\'t know you have." This control specifically addresses the need to
know what is connected to your network. You must develop policy and
procedures around []{#c15.xhtml#Page_237 .pagebreak title="237"
role="doc-pagebreak"}maintaining an accurate inventory. It can be rather
tedious, but it is critical. If you do it right, it reduces loss risks.
You must know what is on your network and who the system belongs to and
use that data to prevent anyone unauthorized from accessing the network.
Creating a system inventory is a common task for system and network
administrators. An open source security audit tool Nmap or Zenmap has
all the necessary features needed to run an ad hoc or automated
inventory process. By simply scanning a network using the operating
system identification (`‐O`) command switch and possibly verbose output
(`‐v`) command switch, you can get a list of systems and their
protocols. The inventory created provides information that is critical
to system, application, and protocol management. The inventory will not
include information such as how much memory the system has or how many
processors there are. This type of hardware inventory requires either an
SNMP agent on the system or a script running on the system to determine
the hardware in the system.
What do all network‐connected devices have in common? They speak to each
other using a logical address called *IP addresses*. Who manages IP
addresses? Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) manages IP
addresses. DHCP also generates logs. For DHCP‐enabled networks,
deploying a mechanism to focus on combining system inventory with
configuration management and network access control is a win‐win. The
inventory management portion is usually based on some type of endpoint
management software like System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM).
SCCM is a Microsoft systems management software product for managing
large groups of computers from servers to workstations to mobile
devices. Do not forget IoT when you are coming up with a management
policy of your hardware inventory.
If you are a Microsoft customer with an existing Microsoft enterprise
agreement, you may already have an SCCM license. SCCM provides software
distribution, operating system deployment, and network access as well as
the CIS control hardware inventory. There are a couple of options when
implementing at SCCM. There is a datacenter edition as well as a
standard edition. Both editions include the following tools:
-   [Configuration Manager---for managing the deployment of applications
    and devices in an enterprise network]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0008}
-   [Data Protection Manager---for performing backup and recovery for
    business continuance and disaster recovery]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0009}
-   [Endpoint Protection---for managing anti‐malware and firewall
    security]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0010}
-   [Operations Manager---for monitoring the health and performance of
    operating systems and hypervisors]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0011}
-   [Orchestrator---for standardizing and automating processes for
    operational efficiency]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0012}
-   [[]{#c15.xhtml#Page_238 .pagebreak title="238"
    role="doc-pagebreak"}Service Manager---for change control and asset
    lifecycle management]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0013}
-   [Virtual Machine Manager---for provisioning and managing resources
    used to create virtual machines]{#c15.xhtml#c15-li-0014}

### Inventory and Control of Software Assets {#c15.xhtml#head-3-15}
Taking an inventory and control of software installed on your assets is
taking the first control to the next level. You should be able to see
what software is on your systems, who installed it, and what its
function is. You need this information to prevent software that is not
authorized from being installed on endpoints. Some organizations see
this as a very complicated, highly managed process, but there are
several ways to do this efficiently and automatically.
Many of the methods used to implement the inventory of authorized and
unauthorized software will also improve the implementation of other
controls relating to network access, asset configuration, and system
management. Administrator access and installation rights should not be
granted for every user. I have worked for organizations where all
employees, including the warehouse personnel and receptionist, had
administrative rights on their computer and could download any
application they wanted with no processes in place to protect the
network. Limiting who can install software also limits who can install
seemingly innocent applications or games that include malware, adware,
and other unwanted code.
Once installation rights have been limited, the next stage is creating a
list of unauthorized and authorized applications. This is called
*blacklisting* and *whitelisting*. Blacklisted software should never be
allowed on the network, and whitelisting is the software the
organization needs to get the job done. This can be rolled out as an
authorized software policy first and followed up with scanning, removal,
and, then, central inventory control. The inventory management portion
is usually based on a software inventory tool or endpoint management
services such as SCCM or based on GPO and local policy controls on
Windows.
AppLocker, natively in Windows 10 and Server, can help you control which
apps and files users can run on their systems. AppLocker can define
rules based on file attributes, assign a rule to a group or user, and
create exceptions to rules. It also helps reduce what is seemingly
complicated, like standardizing approved software configuration to
disallowing unlicensed software or certain apps from running.
Aside from AppLocker, Microsoft allows Group Policy--based whitelisting
for supported versions of Windows. These can be edited locally using
`secpol.msc` unless you have the Home version of Windows. If your
organization has a domain controller or Group Policy Objects, you can
use the same process by accessing Software Restriction Policies (SRP).
For more general‐purpose workstations, a number of client‐based
solutions exist, including antivirus and endpoint protection suites that
limit software from a central console, like Carbon Blacks Consolidated
Endpoint Security.
You can use software inventory to collect information about files on
client devices that already exist. It can be a specific file, files with
a specific extension, []{#c15.xhtml#Page_239 .pagebreak title="239"
role="doc-pagebreak"}or all files on the computer. Software inventory
can also collect files from client devices and store them on the site
server. SCCM is an option for this kind of mature process, especially if
you have it in place for hardware management as well. All the machines
in an SCCM environment will have an SCCM client agent installed on them.
This helps a machine to be able to communicate with the SCCM servers to
receive their respective packages. Packages contain the executable files
and the command lines for an application to be installed. These packages
are then replicated on distribution points. Distribution points are
servers used to store the content of the packages for a particular
region. Machines that are remotely located can locally download the
application from a distribution point, rather than connecting all the
way to the SCCM primary server.
A deployment of approved software is created by the SCCM administrator.
With the help of the SCCM client agent installed on the end user\'s
machine, it keeps checking for new policies or deployments. After
software inventory is enabled, clients run a software inventory cycle.
The client sends the information to a management point in the client\'s
site. The management point then forwards the inventory information to
the SCCM site server. This information is stored in the site database.
When software inventory runs on a client device, the first report is a
full inventory. In the next cycle, the reports contain only updated
inventory information, giving you the most current information of what
is on that system.

### Continuous Vulnerability Management {#c15.xhtml#head-3-16}
Organizations today operate in a constant dynamic stream of new security
information: software updates, patches, and security advisories. It is
easy to become overwhelmed with the amount of cybersecurity threat
advisories that bombard our inboxes daily. Being able to understand and
manage vulnerabilities is a continuous activity and requires a
significant amount of time and attention to do it well.
A big part of your assessment and remediation has to do with scanning
and finding the vulnerabilities in the hardware and software you have
the inventory of from CIS controls 1 and 2. By not proactively scanning
for vulnerabilities and addressing discovered flaws, the likelihood of
an organization\'s computer systems becoming compromised is high.
Identifying and remediating vulnerabilities on a regular basis is also
essential to a strong overall information security program. Depending on
your organization\'s maturity, you may scan monthly or weekly. Some
three‐letter‐agencies I have worked with scan for vulnerabilities every
single night and patch every day. You have to create a process around
remediation and ensure that the most mission‐critical assets with the
most dangerous vulnerabilities get fixed first.
One of my favorite sites that I recommend you add to your RSS feed is
`www.us‐cert.gov/ncas/current‐activity`. This web page by the United
States Computer Emergency Readiness Team is regularly updated with the
most frequent and high‐impact security incidents. Another site is
`https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search`. Here you can search the
vulnerability database for a product, vendor, or []{#c15.xhtml#Page_240
.pagebreak title="240" role="doc-pagebreak"}specific CVE. Finally,
`https://cve.mitre.org/` is an extremely valuable resource for a list of
entries with each containing an identification number, a description,
and a reference for every publicly known cybersecurity vulnerability. I
normally check in with these sites once a week to see what is out there.

### Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges {#c15.xhtml#head-3-17}
Have you noticed that the critical controls are following a logical
progression? As you gradually improve your security posture, they layer
on top of each other. Now that you know what you have and what\'s on
those machines, including vulnerabilities, you need to control who has
access to those machines.
One of my favorite penetration tester\'s story is of a targeted phishing
campaign launched against a specific department where six people clicked
the link in the email, and two of the six were logged into their
administrators account when they clicked and were compromised in 22
seconds. Within hours, the entire network belonged to the pen tester.
You have to control who has administrative privileges and even how those
administrators use their credentials. When you are logged in as an
admin, you should not be opening your email under any circumstances.
That is what your user account is for.
Two very common attacks rely on privilege to execute. That is one reason
CVSS actually measures if privilege is necessary for exploitability. The
first type of an attack is like the one I described previously where a
user with elevated credentials opens a malicious attachment. The other
is the elevation of privilege when cracking a password for an
administrator. If the password policy is weak or not enforced, the
danger increases exponentially.
Educate your leadership and help create a robust security posture where
you restrict admin privilege. Have your IT admins make a list of the
tasks that they do on an average day. Check the tasks that require
administrative credentials. Create an account for normal tasks that all
users can do and use the admin account for only those tasks where it\'s
necessary. If you have executives insisting that they need admin
