### Inferring the Origin of Routing Changes Based on Preferred Path Changes

#### 1. Introduction
To accurately infer the origin of routing changes, we propose a method that focuses on the stability of specific prefixes and preferred paths. This method allows us to cluster candidate origins detected within a specified time window and measure the time variance of detection times for each cluster. The goal is to identify the most relevant window time \( T \) that reflects the convergence delay of the monitoring network.

#### 2. Methodology
1. **Cluster Candidate Origins:**
   - For each preferred path, cluster candidate origins detected within \( T \) seconds from the first detected origin.
   - If the same origin is detected within \( T \) seconds, create a new cluster from that origin. This indicates that the link recovered once within \( T \) seconds, and we consider the second detection to be from a different failure event.
   - For each cluster, infer the link closest to the monitor as the origin.

2. **Determine Window Time \( T \):**
   - Focus on the convergence delay of the monitoring network by measuring the number of clusters created at different intervals of \( T \) and the time variance \( V \) (where \( T \geq V \)) of the detection times for each cluster.
   - Measure the difference in detection times between the first and last detected links in each cluster. If a cluster includes only a single link or multiple links with the same detection time, the time variance for these clusters is 0.

3. **Distribution Analysis:**
   - The distribution of time variances should reflect the actual convergence delay of the network.
   - Figure 2 shows the number of clusters created at different window times \( T \) and the distribution of time variances \( V \) for monitoring points at AS22388 and AS3356. The values of \( T \) range from 60 seconds to 600 seconds at intervals of 60 seconds.

#### 3. Results
- **Time Variance Distribution:**
  - For both AS22388 and AS3356, a large proportion of the clusters have a time variance \( V = 0 \) for all values of \( T \). This indicates high accuracy in clustering links inferred from the same event.
  - At AS22388, the number of clusters stabilizes around \( T = 240 \), while at AS3356, it stabilizes around \( T = 300 \).

- **Evaluation:**
  - For the evaluation, we use \( T = 180 \) for AS22388 and \( T = 300 \) for AS3356. These values are chosen based on the convergence delay often referred to in the Internet [7].

#### 4. Case Studies
- **Case Study 1:**
  - A session failure between AS22388 and AS7660 on September 15, 2009, due to an exceed in the number of prefixes allowed on the link.
  - Our scheme correctly inferred the link (22388,7660) as the origin, matching the reported failure and recovery times.

- **Case Study 2:**
  - A core router in Chicago (AS11537) was unavailable for several peers on March 12, 2010, due to router maintenance.
  - Our scheme inferred the link (11537,14048) as the origin, matching the peers described in the ticket.

#### 5. Evaluation
- **Using Operational Tickets:**
  - We evaluated our scheme using operational tickets from TRANSPAC2 (AS22388), APAN-JP (AS7660), and Internet2 (AS11537).
  - Out of 50 tickets, origins were accurately identified for 86% of the tickets. For 6% of the tickets, origins were misinferred due to a lack of prefixes, and for 8% of the tickets, no routing updates were observed.

- **Comparing Inferred Origins:**
  - Table 4 shows the number of origins inferred over the month of September 2009 using AS22388 and AS3356.
  - When our scheme is enabled, the number of candidate links and inferred origins is significantly reduced, indicating the importance of analyzing the routing status during path exploration and link recovery.

#### 6. Discussion
- **Routing Changes:**
  - Routing changes can occur due to link failures, intra-AS failures, and changes in routing policies. Our scheme helps operators diagnose reachability issues by inferring adjacent links.
  - Figure 4 shows the frequency of links inferred as origins, indicating a Zipf-like distribution where a small number of links are repeatedly inferred.

#### 7. Conclusion and Future Work
- **Conclusion:**
  - Our methodology effectively infers the origin of routing changes and reduces the number of inferred origins by 72% compared to existing schemes.
- **Future Work:**
  - Further work includes finding the most relevant duration for measuring the preferred path of prefixes and evaluating the scheme using BGP data from multiple monitoring points.
