##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
playbook, tags
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    2.4.0
##### SUMMARY
Fact_gathering is run for plays that do not match a tag.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    - hosts: node-1
      gather_facts: yes
      tags:
        - node-tag
To skip the play run either  
`ansible-playbook -i node-1, play.yml --skip-tags="node-tag"`  
or  
`ansible-playbook -i node-1, play.yml --tags="mismatch"`
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Works fine with `--skip tags=node-tag`: the play is matched and skipped.  
I have expected the same behaviour with --tags=mismatch.
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
When run with `--tags=mismatch`, the play is mismatched and is skipped.
However, ansible still tries to gather the facts. It fails because node-1 does
not exist.
