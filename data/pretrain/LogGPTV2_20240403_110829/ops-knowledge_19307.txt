User: I have a number of clients who need to connect to a server and maintain the connection for some time (around 4 hours). I don't want to specify a different connection port for each client (as there are potentially many of them) I would like them just to be able to connect to the server on a specific predetermined port e.g., 10800 and have the server accept and maintain the connection but still be able to receive other connections from new clients. Is there a way to do this in Python or do I need to re-think the architecture.
EXTRA CREDIT: A Python snippet of the server code doing this would be amazing!

You don't need that.

That's how TCP already works.
Just create a socket listening to port 10800 and accept connections from it.
