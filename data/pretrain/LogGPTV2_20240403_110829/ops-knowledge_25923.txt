User: I just started using Google App Engine and I am very new to Python. I may have made a stupid mistake or a fatal error, I don't know, but I realized that the basic "template" I downloaded from a website was old and used Python 2.5.
So, I decided to update to Python 2.7 (after recieving a warning in the site's dashboard).
I have no idea how to do this, but I blindly followed some instructions on how to update but I'm not sure what I did wrong.
I know that I downloaded Python 2.7 (as the download path is C:/Python27/), so there shouldn't be a problem there. Can anybody tell what I'm doing wrong?
Assistant: Thank you everyone for your respective answers and comments, but I recently stumbled upon GAE boilerplate and decided to use that and everything's fine. I kept having very odd problems with GAE beforehand, but the boilerplate is simple and seems to be working fine so far. Anyways, thanks again. (Note: I would delete the question but two people have already answered and received rep from +1s, and they are in fact helpful answers, so I'll leave it be).
