and degrading the performance of the victim servers. During
our experiments, when launching a power attack against the
rack with our malicious traces, the CPU cores of server E were
overheated, resulting in system failure. In a rack where power
is aggressively oversubscribed, a power attack can lead to more
serious consequence: the trip of circuit breaker (CB). The 4-
machine rack used in our experiments is located in a server
room with the total number of 16 servers. The entire server
room can be regarded as a PaaS rack, where all servers are
connected by the same CB. Users can run different applications
on the servers in the room and only the four servers in
our small rack are under our control. When we conducted
experiments that run the SPECCPU 456 benchmarks, the CB
of the server room was tripped. This accident indicates that
power attacks can be a serious threat in real world.
However, our experimental results do not stand for the
most powerful power attack in real world. First, the HPC
benchmarks we used are only CPU-intensive. The memory and
I/O devices are not fully exercised in our experiments, leaving
space for further increase of power consumption. In real world,
an attacker can include memory and I/O intensive workloads to
further increase power consumption. Second, the servers used
in our experiments have poor power proportionality. These
servers consume over 60% of peak power when being idle.
Such poor power proportionality will signiﬁcantly reduce the
effects of power attack because there is not much room for the
increase of power consumption. In real world, a power attack
against data centers with more advanced servers should be
able to produce more signiﬁcant impacts than our experimental
results.
V. POWER ATTACK IN IAAS
This section describes the potential attack vectors in the
IaaS environment and presents the experimental results and
analysis of evaluation on two attack vectors: parasite attack
and VM migration.
A. IaaS and attack vectors
Known as infrastructure as a service, IaaS is a cloud-service
model in which the provider offers physical or virtualized
infrastructure along with other resources to users. Amazon’s
Elastic Cloud (EC2) is a popular IaaS service. In the EC2
environment, a user can instantiate virtual machines (VMs)
via the interface or API provided by EC2. The booted VMs
are under full control of the user. In other words, while the
service vendor manages the hypervisor and physical devices,
the user can determine the OS, middleware, application and
data running on the VMs. IaaS provides a cost-effective way
for enterprises to modernize and expand their IT capabilities
without spending capital resources on infrastructure. However,
IaaS-based data centers are also exposed to the threat of power
attack.
First of all, the IaaS business model allows an attacker to
have more control over the target. The attacker can instantiate
many VMs with minor cost and run any kind of workloads on
the VMs.
Second, IaaS divulges a considerable amount of internal
data center information to the attacker. For the convenience in
management, an IaaS data center often uses some well-known
topology and networking conﬁguration strategies [29]. Thus,
the attacker can infer the internal structure of the data center
and locate the target inside the data center via network probing.
Third, the widely used virtualization techniques in IaaS
expose performance vulnerability to malicious attackers. In
particular,
layer introduced by virtualization
makes many system activities such as I/O operations more
costly. The induced high overhead can be exploited by attack-
ers to generate power spikes.
the additional
Based on these vulnerabilities of IaaS, we propose two
attack vectors to launch a power attack in IaaS environments.
The ﬁrst attack vector is parasite attack that leverages con-
trolled VMs to attack the host physical machine from inside,
resembling a parasite consuming its host from inside. On one
hand, the controlled VMs can directly run intensive workloads
to increase the power consumption of the host. On the other
hand,
the vulnerability of
virtualization to further abuse more resources and power of the
host system. For instance, DoS attacks towards a parasite VM
can consume considerable resources of the hypervisor [30],
potentially increasing the power consumption of the host.
Using these two attack strategies together, a parasite attack
can signiﬁcantly increase the power consumption of a target
system.
the controlled VMs can exploit
The second vector is VM migration that
is a routine
operation in the cloud. Certain VMs require live migration
to perform maintenance and update. VM migration is a high
power consuming operation. If an attacker can understand
how VM migration is performed in an IaaS data center, VM
migration can be exploited to help launch a power attack.

Knowing that a number of VMs are being migrated to a rack,
the attacker can launch a power attack like a parasite attack
against the rack at the same time period. Since VM migration
itself can cause high power spikes, it will greatly aggravate
the power attack and cause the trip of CB.
B. Evaluation of parasite attack
The complete process of a parasite attack is as follows.
First the attacker keeps instantiating VMs and infers their
physical locations with the strategies mentioned above. In this
way, the attacker can ﬁnally place many VMs on the physical
machines within a target rack. Then, the attacker can run
intensive workloads on the controlled VMs to increase the
power consumption of the host systems. During this phase,
the parasites fully consume the resources that are allocated to
them by the hosts. Finally, the attacker can launch some special
attacks, e.g., DoS attacks towards the parasite VMs. Since the
parasite VMs are under full control of the attacker, an attack
towards parasites can ensure a success. Due to the performance
penalty of virtualization, such an attack can trigger unexpected
system activities at the hypervisor level, leading to resource
abuse of the host system. As a result, the power consumption
of the entire host system can be further increased to a higher
level.
To evaluate the feasibility of a parasite attack, we build
up a virtualized system with multiple VMs and launch attacks
against one of the VMs. The host machine is Server B in
Table I. We run 4 virtual machines over the host, including
the ”parasite VM” controlled by the attacker. These VMs are
installed with Ubuntu 12.10 and they are conﬁgured with 512
MB memory and 4 vcpus. The open-source tool hping3 is used
to launch DoS attacks. Three different types of DoS attacks
are launched: TCP SYN ﬂood, Smurf, and LAND attacks. The
power consumption of the host machine is recorded.
At the beginning, all these 4 VMs are running certain
workloads so that their system utilizations remain around 25%,
which is normal in real world. Under this scenario, the host
consumes around 180 W of power. In the next step, we run
intensive workload on the VM controlled by the attacker. With
the parasite VM being fully exercised, the power consumption
of the host is increased to around 200 W. Then, we launch DoS
attacks against the parasite VM. Under DoS-based parasite
attacks, the power consumption of the host is increased to
above 230 W, with power spikes that can reach 245 W.
The experimental results are shown in Figure 7, and they
clearly demonstrate that parasite attacks can increase the power
consumption of the host by over 30%.
C. Exploiting VM migration
Since users have more control over VMs and more in-
ternal information is available in IaaS, VM migration can be
exploited to help launch a power attack in IaaS. To measure the
power consumption spikes generated during a VM migration,
we conduct three rounds of experiments. First, a basic VM
migration is conducted to verify that for a server involved in
the migration, it will experience a power rise. In the second
round, the scenario where VMs are migrated within a rack is
emulated to show the impact of intra-rack VM migration on
the overall power consumption of a rack. Finally, we emulate
the scenario where multiple VMs are simultaneously migrated
from other racks to a target rack to demonstrate the threat
caused by inter-rack VM migration.
In the ﬁrst round of experiments, Server B and Server C in
Table I are used as our testbed. The VMs running on the servers
are initialized with 512MB memory, 8G image size, 4 vcpus
and default credits (512). We set server B as the monitored
server whose power consumption will be recorded. We ﬁrst
set server B as the destination server, migrating 1 idle VM
from server C to server B. Then we set server B as the source
server, migrating 1 idle VM from it to server C.
Figure 8 illustrates the power consumption of the moni-
tored server. The ﬁgure demonstrates that during the migra-
tion, as either the source or the destination, the server will
experience a rise of power consumption. The cause of a short
period of power spike is the initialization and operation of
VM migration. At the source side, the memory contents need
to be duplicated; additional computation is required to prepare
the transition; and networking devices are also exercised to
transfer VM information. At the destination side, additional
resources are allocated to the new incoming VM, increasing
the server’s power consumption.
In the second round, we emulate the intra-rack VM migra-
tion as following. We connect Server A, Server B, and Server
C to the same circuit breaker, making up an IaaS rack. We boot
8 VMs in each of the 3 servers with the SPECCPU benchmarks
running on them. In this round of migration, we migrate 4 VMs
from server A to server B, 4 VMs from server B to server C,
and 4 VMs from server C to server A.
the migrations are started at
The power consumption of the entire rack during the
migration is illustrated in Figure 9. We can see that there
are several crests of power consumption. This is due to
the different conﬁgurations of the servers in our testbed.
Although all
the same time,
different conﬁgurations lead to different migration time and
different power consumption. These results indicate that when
multiple VMs are migrated together as in our experiments,
the rack will experience some unexpected power spikes. In
our experiments, the rack has already been working in a high
power consumption state. During the migration, the power
consumption of the rack further rises from 560 W to 640
W. The power spikes over 600 W last for over 15 seconds.
Suppose the CB of the rack has a rated power capacity of
600 W, as the power consumption of the rack is below 560 W
both before and after migration. If the migration strategies do
not take the migration power spikes into a serious account [8],
[32], the power spikes will trip the CB of the rack, resulting
in disastrous server shutdowns.
In the third round, we emulate the inter-rack VM migration.
In real world data centers, it is common that a number of vir-
tual machines are migrated simultaneously, probably towards
the same rack. For example, periodic live VM migration has
been commonly adopted as an effective way to perform server
consolidation for higher resource utilizations in data centers
[33], [34]. In our experiments, we set server B in a separate
rack and set servers A and C in the other racks. Therefore,
the power consumption of server B is recorded as the power

consumption of the target rack. We migrate 2 VMs from server
A to server B and another 2 VMs from server C to server B in
parallel. Server B originally runs 4 VMs with the SPECCPU
workload and all the VMs that are migrated to server B also
run SPECCPU on them.
Figure 10 illustrates the power consumption of the target
rack during the migration. At the beginning, the target rack has
power consumption around 225 W. When the migration begins,
the power consumption of the target begins to rise rapidly.
Within a short period, the target can reach a power peak over
280 W. After the migration ends, the power consumption of the
target rack reduces to around 260 W. Such results indicate that
if there are multiple VMs migrated to one rack simultaneously,
the target rack will experience signiﬁcant power spikes and
such power spikes can be exploited by an attacker to trip the
CB of the target rack.
D. Damage assessment and discussion
Our experimental results verify the feasibility of launching
a power attack in IaaS. With one parasite VM residing in the
host, a parasite attack can increase the power consumption
of a virtualized system by more than 30%. Such an attack is
as powerful as the attack in PaaS. In real world, the parasite
attack effect can be higher than what we achieved in the
experiments since the attacker is able to place more than one
parasite VMs on a target. More parasite VMs imply that more
controlled VMs on the host run in full utilization, generating
more power consumption. In addition, more parasite VMs can
also make DoS attacks more powerful. As Figure 7 shows,
Smurf attack incurs more power consumption than TCP SYN
ﬂood and LAND attacks. The reason is that TCP SYN ﬂood
and LAND attacks can only affect one victim VM, but Smurf
attack broadcasts packets to a range of IP addresses and makes
VMs communicate with each other, which can affect multiple
VMs. Thus, if the attacker is able to launch DoS attacks to
multiple parasite VMs, the impact of a power attack upon the
host will be more signiﬁcant.
In addition to parasite attacks, we also demonstrate that
VM migration can be exploited to help launch a power attack.
Although attackers can hardly directly manipulate the VM
migration routine in a data center, they can infer how and when
VM migration is conducted and launch a power attack against
the rack that is conducting VM migration. As our experimental
results demonstrate, VM migration can increase the power
consumption of a rack by over 30% even when the rack is
