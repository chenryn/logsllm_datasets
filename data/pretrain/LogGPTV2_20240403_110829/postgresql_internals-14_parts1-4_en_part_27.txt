14.5 Predicate Locks
The term predicate lock appeared as early as the first attempts to implement full
isolationbasedonlocks.1 Theproblemconfrontedatthattimewasthatlocking
alltherowstobereadandupdatedstillcouldnotguaranteefullisolation.Indeed,
if new rows that satisfy the filter condition get inserted into the table, they will
p. becomephantoms.
Forthisreason,itwassuggestedtolockconditions(predicates)ratherthanrows.
Ifyourunaquerywiththea>10predicate,lockingthispredicatewillnotallow
addingnewrowsintothetableiftheysatisfythiscondition,sophantomswillbe
avoided. The trouble is that if a query with a different predicate appears, such
as a  CREATE TABLE pred(n numeric, s text);
=> INSERT INTO pred(n) SELECT n FROM generate_series(1,10000) n;
=> CREATE INDEX ON pred(n) WITH (fillfactor = 10);
=> ANALYZE pred;
