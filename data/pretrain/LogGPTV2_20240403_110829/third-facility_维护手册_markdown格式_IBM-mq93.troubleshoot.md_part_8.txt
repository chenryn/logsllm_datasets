### Troubleshooting SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE

**Issue:**
The `SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE` has not been modified.

**Diagnostic Steps:**

1. **Is the Issue Caused by a Program?**
   - Does the problem occur on all IBM MQ systems and queue managers, or only on specific ones?
   - Identify any applications that are consistently running when the issue occurs. If found, examine the application for errors.

2. **Network-Related Issues:**
   - Does the problem affect specific parts of the network?
   - Have there been any recent network-related changes or modifications to IBM MQ definitions that might be causing the issue?
   - Check if specific network components (e.g., remote queues) are affected. For example, if the link to a remote message queue manager is not working, messages will not flow to the remote queue.
   - Verify the connection between the two systems and ensure that the intercommunication component of IBM MQ is operational.
   - Ensure that messages are reaching the transmission queue and check the local and remote queue definitions.

3. **Time-Specific Issues:**
   - Does the problem occur at specific times of the day?
   - If so, it may be related to system loading. Peak system loading typically occurs mid-morning and mid-afternoon. If your IBM MQ network spans multiple time zones, peak loading times may differ.

4. **Intermittent Issues:**
   - Is the problem intermittent?
   - Intermittent issues can be caused by processes running independently. For example, an MQGET call without a wait option before an earlier process completes. Another cause could be an application trying to retrieve a message from a queue before the put call is committed.

### Troubleshooting Checklist

#### 1. Are Messages Failing to Arrive on the Queue?
   - Check if the queue is defined correctly (e.g., `MAXMSGL` is sufficiently large).
   - Ensure the queue is enabled for putting.
   - Verify if the queue is full.
   - Check for exclusive access by another application.
   - Ensure the wait interval for the MQGET call is appropriate.
   - Verify the correct `MsgId` or `CorrelId` for the message.
   - Check if other applications can get messages from the queue.
   - Verify if the expected message was defined as persistent.
   - Check the process that should put the message onto the queue for issues such as:
     - Application start and stop status.
     - Trigger monitor and trigger process definition.
     - Transaction commit status.

#### 2. Do Messages Contain Unexpected or Corrupted Information?
   - Check if the application or the message-sending application has changed. Ensure all changes are reflected on all systems.
   - Verify if messages are being sent to the wrong queue.
   - Check if the trigger information is correctly specified.

#### 3. Are Unexpected Messages Received When Using Distributed Queues?
   - Ensure IBM MQ is correctly installed and configured for distributed queuing on both systems.
   - Verify the availability and configuration of links between the systems.
   - Check if triggering is set on the sending system and if the remote system is activated.
   - Verify if the queue is full and if messages are on the dead-letter queue.
   - Check for mismatches between sending and receiving queue managers.
   - Verify channel definitions and data conversion settings.

#### 4. No Response from a PCF Command
   - Check if the command server is running.
   - Verify if a reply has been sent to the dead-letter queue.
   - Check the error log for messages.
   - Ensure queues are enabled for put and get operations.
   - Verify the `WaitInterval` setting.
   - Check if a sync point is needed.
   - Verify the `MAXDEPTH` and `MAXMSGL` attributes.
   - Use the `MsgId` and `CorrelId` fields correctly.
   - Try stopping and restarting the command server and queue managers.

#### 5. Only Some Queues Failing
   - Check the local queues for issues.
   - Use the `DISPLAY QUEUE` command to check queue attributes.
   - Verify the trigger monitor and depth settings.
   - Check if the queue can be shared.
   - Verify the queue's GET and PUT enablement.

#### 6. Problem Affects Only Remote Queues
   - Check if required channels have started and can be triggered.
   - Verify if the programs putting messages to remote queues have reported issues.
   - Check if triggering is set on the transmission queue.
   - Review error logs for channel errors.
   - Manually start the channel if necessary.

#### 7. Error Code When Creating or Starting a Queue Manager on Windows
   - Ensure the user under which the IBM MQ Windows service is running has sufficient rights.
   - Verify the user account configuration for the IBM MQ Windows service.

#### 8. Application or System Running Slowly
   - Check if the system is operating near its capacity limits.
   - Verify if the performance issue is independent of system loading.
   - Check for poorly designed application programs.
   - Verify if applications are writing persistent messages outside a unit of work.
