When attempting to invoke a Python script from a C application using the `system()` call, you may encounter issues if the script is not being executed as expected. Here are some steps and considerations to help ensure your setup is correct:

1. **Shebang Line**: Your Python script should have the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/python3` at the top. This specifies the interpreter to use when running the script.

2. **File Permissions**: Ensure that the Python script has executable permissions. You can set this by running:
   ```sh
   chmod +x python_script
   ```

3. **Correct Path**: Verify that the path to the Python script is correct. If the script is in the same directory as your C application, you can use a relative path. Otherwise, provide the full path to the script.

4. **Using `system()` Call**:
   - If the script has the correct shebang line and executable permissions, you should be able to run it directly using:
     ```c
     system("./python_script");
     ```
   - If the script does not have executable permissions or the shebang line is not working as expected, you can explicitly specify the Python interpreter:
     ```c
     system("/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/python_script");
     ```

5. **Debugging**:
   - Check if the script runs correctly from the command line:
     ```sh
     ./python_script
     ```
   - If it fails, check for any error messages that might indicate the issue.
   - Ensure that `/usr/bin/python3` is the correct path to your Python interpreter. You can verify this by running:
     ```sh
     which python3
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully invoke your Python script from your C application using the `system()` call.
