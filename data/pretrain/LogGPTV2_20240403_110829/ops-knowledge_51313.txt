User: I am trying to invoke python script from C application using system() call
The python script has #!/usr/bin/python3 on the first line.
If I do system(python_script), the script does not seem to run.
It seems I need to do system(/usr/bin/python3 python_script).
I thought I do not need to specify the interpreter externally if I have #!/usr/bin/python3 in the first line of the script.
Am I doing something wrong?
Assistant: Make sure you have executable permission for python_script.
You can make python_script executable by 
chmod +x python_script
Also check if you are giving correct path for python_script
