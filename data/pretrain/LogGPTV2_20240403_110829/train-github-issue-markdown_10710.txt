### Issue with Renaming Across TypeScript Projects

**Date:** April 12, 2016  
**Time:** 15:52  
**Original Issue:** [microsoft/vscode#5194](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/5194)

#### Project Structure
- **Top-Level Directory:**
  - `Typescript Client` (subfolder)
  - `Typescript Node Server` (subfolder)
  - `common` (directory for isomorphic TypeScript code)

#### Problem Description
I have a project with the structure described above. To enable renaming across files, a `tsconfig.json` file is required. This file should include the top-level module of the project, and all submodules must be properly imported.

When I attempt to rename a class defined in the `common` directory, the change is only applied to one of the two TypeScript projects (either the `Typescript Client` or the `Typescript Node Server`). Adding a top-level `tsconfig.json` that references the starting modules of both projects did not resolve this issue.

#### Expected Behavior
Ideally, the refactoring tool should follow all `tsconfig.json` module trees as needed, ensuring that the rename operation is applied consistently across all relevant projects.
