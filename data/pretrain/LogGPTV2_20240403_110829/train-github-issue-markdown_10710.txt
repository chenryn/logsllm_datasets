I have a folder that contains a Typescript Client and Typescript Node Server
subfolder. There is a third top level directory, common, where we store our
isomorphic Typescript code.
In order for a rename to work across files a tsconfig.json file is needed that
includes the top module of your project and all submodules must be imported
properly.
When attempting to perform a rename of a class defined in the common folder
the action is only applied to one of the two typescript projects. Adding a top
level tsconfig.json that points to the starting modules of both projects did
not change this behavior.
Ideally, a refactor would follow all tsconfig.json module trees as needed.
