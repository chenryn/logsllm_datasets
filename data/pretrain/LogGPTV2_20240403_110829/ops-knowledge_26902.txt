User: I'm working on a Appium Python test script for AWS Device Farm. I get error while building the script as;
Could not find any downloads that satisfy the requirement package-name (like PAM, Twisted-Core etc) 
I've already solved almost all of them, but still have problem with adium-theme-ubuntu.
This package is already installed on my system and virtualenv, but I still get same error for this package.
How should I solve this issue?
Thank you in advance
Assistant: I might have a similar issue here.
Got the same error while trying to import a requirement.txt into a virtualenv. something like "No matching distribution found for adium-theme-ubuntu==0.3.4"
Solved it by include --system-site-packages when creating the virtualenv. 
Hope it helps
