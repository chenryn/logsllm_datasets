Question: You are configuring a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack for a mobile penetration test using an external USB WiFi card and a separate wired network interface on a Kali Linux system. You have ensured that your USB WiFi card supports access point (AP) mode. Select the configuration steps necessary to route the traffic from the mobile devices through your host computer to the target network:
"A": "Set up the USB WiFi card with hostapd to create an AP network, configure dnsmasq for DHCP services, and use iptables to forward traffic from the AP network to the wired interface.",
"B": "Install a VPN service on the host computer to automatically route all mobile device traffic through the host to the target network.",
"C": "Configure the USB WiFi card to use promiscuous mode to capture all inbound and outbound traffic without setting up an access point.",
"D": "Use airmon-ng to put the USB WiFi card into monitor mode and configure the host computer as a router using the route command."
Answer: A
