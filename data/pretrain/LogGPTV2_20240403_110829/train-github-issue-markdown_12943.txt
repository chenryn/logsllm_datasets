This issue has been bouncing around a bit; basically, on my modal dialogs, I
see a bit of "flicker" (the content rapidly appearing/disappearing) when
hiding or unhiding the dialog.
I was able to capture some of it in a screen capture:

It is most visible when closing the dialog.
This is on Mac 10.7.5 and Chrome 29.0.1547.65.
