User: I am porting a Python investing application to Google App Engine. Every market that you can trade in is a plugin: for example the stocks trading and FOREX trading are all plugins.
The application stores the portfolio (which is a Portfolio class instance containing the active investments (class instances) and history) as a pickle. However you can't write to the disk, and it seems a bit crude to use pickles in the Datastore as a blob, and pickles are also slow and CPU intensive (no cPickle).
Does anyone have any ideas how I can store all the current investments, and the history to the datastore without using large and intensive pickles?
Thank you
Ps. webapp or Django?
Assistant: The key advantages of using Django are its ORM and template system.  The ORM is not very useful with datastore because of its non-relational nature and the template system is available as part of the app engine to be used with webapp.
I have had good success with using webapp and django templates for our project.
