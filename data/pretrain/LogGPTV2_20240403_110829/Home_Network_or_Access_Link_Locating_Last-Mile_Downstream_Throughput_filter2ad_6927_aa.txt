## Abstract
As home networks experience increasingly faster downstream throughput speeds, a key question arises: are users truly benefiting from these faster speeds, or are they encountering performance bottlenecks within their home networks? This paper investigates whether downstream throughput bottlenecks occur more frequently in home networks or in the access ISPs. We identify lightweight metrics that can accurately determine whether a throughput bottleneck lies inside or outside a user's home network and develop a detection algorithm to locate these bottlenecks. We validate this algorithm in controlled settings and report on two deployments, one of which included 2,652 homes across the United States. Our findings indicate that wireless bottlenecks are more common than access-link bottlenecks, particularly in home networks with downstream throughput greater than 20 Mbps, where access-link bottlenecks are relatively rare.

## 1. Introduction
Many countries are investing heavily in increasing the speeds of access network infrastructure. As the downstream throughput of access links improves, it is natural to question whether users are actually reaping the benefits of these faster speeds. The downstream throughput experienced by users may be limited by other factors, such as their home wireless networks, which can face performance issues due to various reasons (e.g., poor placement of access points, interference from competing networks, or even devices on the same network). To address this, we study the following question: Do users more often experience downstream throughput bottlenecks in their access ISPs or in their home wireless networks?

To answer this, we design and implement an algorithm called HoA (Home or Access), which can accurately locate these downstream bottleneces on commodity home routers. We deploy HoA in 2,652 home networks in the United States and characterize the throughput bottlenecks observed in this deployment.

Despite the importance and widespread interest in this question, data and conclusions have been elusive. Existing throughput analysis and wireless diagnosis tools have limitations that make them unsuitable for our study—such as requiring multiple vantage points, performing active measurements, or needing custom hardware. Section 4 discusses how our work relates to previous tools and why they do not apply in our setting. Instead, we develop a passive network measurement tool that can run on low-cost, commodity home network routers. This choice limits the extent of the data we can collect but allows for large-scale deployment. HoA’s simplicity enabled us to implement it on a Netgear router for two in-home deployments: a BISmark router deployment across 64 homes in 15 countries, and another deployment sponsored by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) involving 2,652 homes across the United States. These deployments allowed us to conduct a first-of-its-kind large-scale study of last-mile bottlenecks, detailed in Section 2.6.

Realizing HoA required overcoming several challenges. First, we needed to isolate performance problems in the home network versus outside. Capturing measurements at the home router offers a convenient solution, as it lies between these two parts of the network. Next, we identified and validated metrics that are lightweight enough to capture on a low-cost home router yet sufficient to accurately locate downstream throughput bottlenecks. We also used performance metrics from passive network traffic capture to avoid altering the state of the wireless network or disrupting network performance for home network users. Ultimately, we identified two features—the coefficient of variation of packet inter-arrival time and the round-trip time on the wireless LAN—that can be measured passively, are lightweight, and can identify last-mile bottlenecks in many circumstances. Section 2 incorporates these metrics into a complete identification algorithm.

Our contributions include:
1. The design of HoA, a lightweight tool that accurately detects home access link and wireless network bottlenecks.
2. A detailed characterization of the nature and extent of throughput bottlenecks in many home networks using data from a large-scale prototype deployment of HoA in home routers.

We do not determine the cause of a particular bottleneck (e.g., whether a wireless problem results from poor device placement, non-WiFi interference, or other causes), but rather only where the problem exists, to the granularity of whether the problem is inside or outside the home. Our study yields the following key findings:
- Access link bottlenecks rarely occur in home networks where downstream access throughput exceeds 20 Mbps. Instead, in these cases, throughput bottlenecks are often introduced by the home wireless network.
- Access link bottlenecks are more common for users whose downstream access throughput is less than 10 Mbps.
- In homes with multiple devices where a wireless bottleneck is detected, it is equally likely that only a single device experiences the bottleneck as it is that all devices in the home experience the bottleneck simultaneously.

These results suggest that efforts to improve home wireless network performance are worthwhile, in addition to optimizing performance in other parts of the network and end hosts.

## 2. HoA: Design, Implementation, and Deployments
### 2.1 Design Choices
Our first design choice was to perform measurements from the home access point. Locating bottlenecks at the last mile becomes easier with a vantage point inside the home network. Although vantage points in the access ISP (such as in the DSLAM for a DSL ISP) can see all home traffic, these locations obscure metrics that provide important clues about whether the home wireless network is introducing a bottleneck. Inside the home, we can either instrument end-hosts or the access point itself. Client devices can observe wireless properties from their own traffic but may not observe traffic properties of other clients. A device also cannot determine characteristics of the access link. End-host tools like T-RAT [22] can monitor TCP properties to identify the causes of throughput bottlenecks but cannot isolate the location of congestion.

Our second design choice was to use passive traffic measurements. While active probing may yield useful information, it also has potential drawbacks, such as introducing extra load on the network and affecting the conditions we are trying to measure. It may also disrupt the users hosting our measurement devices. Thus, we rely on passive measurements of in situ user traffic as the main source of information for detecting performance bottlenecks. We aim to do so without custom wireless drivers or anything that could adversely affect the performance of the networks we are measuring, so we look for features at the IP layer that can indicate performance problems. Possible metrics include flow timings and sizes, packet timings and sizes, and information from TCP headers. We briefly discuss our choices.

### 2.2 Network Metrics
Packet arrival timings and TCP RTT are promising metrics because our vantage point at the access point allows us to separately compute these metrics for the WAN and LAN portions of the end-to-end path, potentially allowing us to disambiguate problems on either side of the access point.

#### Packet Interarrival Time
We exploit an observation common to many bottleneck links: packets traversing a bottlenecked link experience buffering immediately upstream of the link, resulting in smoothed arrival patterns downstream. To capture this effect, we use the coefficient of variation of packet interarrival times (cv), which is the standard deviation of packet interarrival time divided by the mean packet interarrival time. In our example, when the access link is the bottleneck, cv = 0.05; whereas, when the wireless is the bottleneck, cv is 0.88. Figure 2 shows the distribution of cv for 100 experiments where we introduced a bottleneck at the access link and 100 experiments where the bottleneck was on the wireless. There is no overlap between the two curves: cv is lower when the access link is the bottleneck versus when it is not.

#### Wireless Round-Trip Time
The second effect is that devices in home networks are only one hop away from the access point, so the baseline latency between the access point and the device should be a few milliseconds. We observe that delays caused by buffering in the wireless network (i.e., those caused by throughput bottlenecks) are significantly higher. We measure this effect by capturing the TCP RTT (τ) between the device and the access point. Figure 3 presents the LAN TCP RTT (the RTT over TCP between the access point and a device in the home network).
