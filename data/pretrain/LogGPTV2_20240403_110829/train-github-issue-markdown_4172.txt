Hi there, I'm stuck here.
Challenge escaping-literal-quotes-in-strings has an issue.  
User Agent is: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36`.
My code:
    var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\"."; // Change this line
So, what's the problem? I can't complete this task because of this error:
> You should use two double quotes (") and four escaped double quotes (").
But.. I'm use them all, no?
