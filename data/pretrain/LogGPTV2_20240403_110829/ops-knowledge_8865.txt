User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Tracking Down Failed Logins I've recently implemented a SIEM solution, and am now able to see a large amount of failed login attempts from legitimate users. In fact, it's such high volume that my SIEM is correlating them to be Brute Force attacks. However they come from a variety of accounts and computers, and are just simple auth attempts against the Domain Controller. I am confident they are not malicious.

What is the best way to track down a failed authentication event on a Domain Controller down to what application in the environment causes the authentication? They are similar to generic events found through Event Viewer on the Domain Controller, and I can see the hostname and username of where the auth came from. 

Here is an example of the flood of logs I'm dealing with:

AV - Alert - "1566830804" --&gt; RID: "18130"; RL: "5"; RG: "windows,win_authentication_failed,"; RC: "Logon Failure - Unknown user or bad
password."; USER: "(no user)"; SRCIP: "192.168.1.59"; HOSTNAME: "(DomainCntrl) 192.168.1.2-&gt;WinEvtLog"; LOCATION: "(DomainCntrl)
192.168.1.2-&gt;WinEvtLog"; EVENT: "[INIT]2019 Aug 26 08:46:42 WinEvtLog: Security: AUDIT_FAILURE(4625): Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing: (no

Assistant: Dealing with Windows failed events can be a very hard task. Firstly, you have consider 2 types of failed events in Windows:


Kerberos logins (not in your scope): ID 4768, 4769, 4771
Windows logins: ID 4625, ID 4776


Considering now your event, the most meaning full events are the following:


Logon Type:   3   > network event
Workstation Name: Win10-Wrk  > source host, but sometimes can be wrong, so better trust the IP
Source Network Address: 192.168.1.59  
Sub Status:  0xc0000064 > MOST IMPORTANT, the error code


In this situation, the error code 0xc0000064  means that the account does not exist. This can report a tentative of account enumeration, but it can also be created because of wrong configuration on domain, servers or even sometimes Exchange mail servers.

What I would suggest now it to verify the Kerberos events on the concerned DC and also enable the failed login auditing on the source machine. This will provide additional information for you analysis.

In case you would like to move one step forward, you can implement the following rule/use case logic in your SIEM for the brutforce rules:
