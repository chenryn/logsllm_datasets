If I'm not at the right place for this issue, I apologize. Not sure where to
get started to solve this error message.
### Problem description
  * a nextjs app which was made from with-material-ui-next, you can find the app having the issue here next-library-starter
  * a npm package called next-library which depends on material-ui and is a dependency of next-library-starter (see The Goal below)
  * everything works great, except I'm receiving an error message for each material-ui component.

### The goal
The goal is to have that npm library with material-ui in order to quickly get
started with new projects. This stuff is slightly beyond my understanding of
npm packages & webpack and I might not be doing it the right way, if so,
please kindly advise.
### Steps to reproduce
    git clone https://github.com/astenmies/next-library-starter.git && cd next-library-starter && yarn && yarn run dev
### Versions
