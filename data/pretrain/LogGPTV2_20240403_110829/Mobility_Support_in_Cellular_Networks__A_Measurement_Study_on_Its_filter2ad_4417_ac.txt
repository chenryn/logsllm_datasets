CONFIGURATIONS AND PERFORMANCE
IMPLICATIONS
We describe our Type-II measurement results to look into real-
world handoff configurations (Q1) and quantify their impacts on
user performance and handoff quality (Q2).
Experimental settings and dataset D1. We assess active-state
and idle-state handoffs in three US cities (Chicago, IL; Indianapolis,
IN; Lafayette, IN) and highways in between.
For active-state handoffs, we run designated data services while
driving locally (
0) than the serving one.
A5 is the most flexible one. It can make the same comparison
as A3 (e.g., offset = the gap in two thresholds). Note that, it differs
from A3 because A5 has additional requirements on the absolute
radio signal quality (the serving one  ΘA5,C). A5 can substitute other events with particular parameter
settings, such as A2 (when ΘA5,C = -140dB, worst RSRP) and A4
(when ΘA5,S = -44dB, best RSRP). In fact, we do observe such
configurations in A5. This explains why other events are rarely
observed.

• Handoff to cells with better radio signal is not always true.
We find that not all handoffs go to a cell with stronger radio signals,
and this choice depends on handoff configurations.
Fig. 6a shows RSRPs before and after handoffs under three de-
cisive reporting events in AT&T (similar for other carriers). For
comparisons, we also plot the cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) for the RSRP changes (δRSRP = RSRPnew − RSRPold) in
Figure 6b.
We see that, for A5, only 52% of handoffs get better in terms of
RSRP (62% for RSRQ). In contrast, A3 and periodic reporting largely
ensure a better radio signal quality: 87% of handoffs have δ>0 and
the ratio goes up to 94% given that 3dB measurement dynamics is
common.
This is because A5 reports two independent conditions: the serv-
ing cell is weaker than one threshold (ΘA5,S ) and the candidate
cell is stronger than another one (ΘA5,C). Given two parameter
configurations, it is not ensured that the new cell is stronger.
We observe that ΘA5,S,rsrq > ΘA5,C,rsrq (e.g., -11.5dB vs. -
14dB). In RSRP cases, the dominant setting is ΘA5,S,rsrp = -44dB (no
requirement) and ΘA5,C,rsrp = −114dB. That is, such A5 events do
not take into account the serving cell’s radio signal strength using
RSRP in AT&T. They are responsible for the cells after handoffs
with weaker radio signal coverage. While this finding differs from
expectations, it matches the consequences of such configurations
well. We further divide δRSRP in A5 into positive (+) (ΘA5,C,rsrq >
ΘA5,S,rsrq) and negative (-) cases; Fig. 6c shows that weaker radio
signal is caused by negative configurations. Such result of event A5
further confirms our finding.
Implications: radio quality during handoffs changes as configured,
but radio signal quality is not always enhanced after handoffs.
• Expected data performance impacts and “questionable” con-
figurations. We show that data performance during handoffs are
also affected by such configurations.
We first present two handoff examples, which are both triggered
by A3 but with different offset values: ∆A3 = 5dB (top) and 12dB
(bottom). We align both routes with the Measurement Report
message (t = 25s) and handoffs are performed right away after the
reporting (within 180 ms). Fig. 7 shows the average throughput in

two time bins (1s and 100ms) while we run a continuous speedtest in
T-Mobile. We see that data throughput decreases down to 2.2 Mbps
(top) and 437Kbps (bottom) before handoffs. Performance is much
worse in the bottom case because ∆A3 is 12dB, much higher than
5dB (top), which invokes the handoff very late after data throughput
has already severely fallen down. The handoff occurs only when
one candidate cell must be much stronger than the serving one.
The minimum throughput before handoffs declines by 80.1% (5×
gap).
We use the minimum throughput before handoffs (reporting) to
assess performance impacts of reporting configurations. Fig. 8 com-
pares performance under representative configurations in AT&T
and T-Mobile. It shows that data performance impacts match with
the anticipated consequences of such configurations. In T-Mobile,
A3a (12 dB) and A5b (−121dB) tend to defer or prevent handoffs
to new cells, compared to A3b (5 dB) and A5a (−87dB). A5 consid-
ers the serving cell’s threshold ΘA5,S (RSRP: -87dB and -121dB)
only. Consequently, they result in lower throughput and worse
handoff quality. This is consistent with observations in AT&T.
A5a (ΘS,RSRP : -44dB) outperforms A5b (-118dB) given the same
ΘC,RSRP (-114dB). It is similar in the A5c/A5d cases which use
RSRQ, but the gap is much smaller as two thresholds are quite
close. Such performance impacts can be somehow derived from
their impacts on radio signal quality. Fig. 9 shows the box-plots of
three pairwise relations: ∆A3 versus δRSRP , ΘA5,S versus rold and
ΘA5,C versus rnew . We choose these three pairs by the purposes
of those parameters. We can see that handoffs are performed as
configured.
Implications: We discover that radio quality signal enhancement
may not be the key to better handoff performance. “Better” configura-
tions should invoke the handoffs in time, well before the performance
degrades or is about to degrade.
Recall, when ΘA5,S = -44dB (RSRP), A5 performs best but stronger
radio signal quality is not guaranteed. This choice relaxes the re-
quirement on the serving cell and creates a larger chance to ob-
tain measurement reports earlier, thus making early handoff possi-
ble. Compared with other strict configurations like ΘA5,S = -118dB
(RSRP), it indeed ensures a handoff only when the current cell is
really poor (depending on the value of ΘA5,S ) and avoids some
handoffs (e.g., where the serving cell is stronger than -118dB while
a neighboring one is even better (e.g., >-100dB)).
This illustrates two different policies for handoff management. The
former is more performance driven while the latter also takes into
account handoff overhead and seeks to reduces handoff frequency.
It is hard to argue which one is better. As the cellular network
infrastructure has been evolving with long-lasting deployment and

upgrades (radio signal coverage likely enhanced and overhead for
frequent handoffs not likely a big concern), it may be the time for
us to update handoff policies and their configurations.
We also note that, it is hard to compare data performance un-
der different configurations (e.g., A3 and A5 in AT&T). A larger
variance is observed in A3, because A3 only regulates the relative
enhancement but the actual serving cell may have large variations.
This raises a question on which configuration contributes to better
handoff performance. If the answer varies at cells (e.g., depend-
ing on nearby radio signal coverage), we seek to learn whether
any mechanism or algorithm handles it at runtime (e.g., reconfigu-
ration). Unfortunately, our following study (§5) seems to reach a
negative conclusion.
4.2 Idle-state Handoff
There is no user traffic during idle-state handoffs. We consider two
issues: (1) What do these configurations look like and what are their
impacts on radio signal quality? (2) Do measurement and decision
perform efficiently?
Radio signals “enhance” after handoffs except for higher pri-
ority target cells. Fig. 10 examines the RSRP change before and
after an idle-state handoff to a target cell with higher, equal or
lower priority in four US carriers. The results are consistent across
different carriers. Almost all the handoffs (except higher-priority
non-intra freq handoffs) go to stronger cells. We observe that most
configuration follow the common expectations: ∆equal > 0 de-
termines that it will choose a stronger cell when both have equal
priorities; Θ
implies that the chosen cell is better
than the previously serving one, when the new cell has a lower
priority. Only in the higher-priority cases, handoffs occur as long as
the candidate cell is better than an absolute value Θ
, regard-
less of the serving one. It is possible that it switches to a weaker
cell (20% observed).

Implications: handoffs use priority + radio signal thresholds to
tune their policies on radio signal evaluation. Higher-priority cells
may be preferred for better performance even with lower radio
signal quality (4G vs 3G/2G) or non-performance reasons (e.g.,
operators favor some newly deployed cells and acquired bands, see
the instance observed in §5.4.1).
Measurement efficiency (necessity) is not always guaranteed.
We examine whether measurements run efficiently and whether
all measurements are necessary. We consider two issues.
