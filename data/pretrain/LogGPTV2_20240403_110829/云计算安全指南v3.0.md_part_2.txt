编者寄语
Over the past three years, the Cloud Security Alliance has attracted around 120 corporate members and has a broad
remit to address all aspects of cloud security, including compliance, global security-related legislation and regulation,
identity management, and the challenge of monitoring and auditing security across a cloud-based IT supply chain. CSA is
becoming the focal point for security standards globally, aligning multiple, disparate government policies on cloud
security and putting forward standards for ratification by international standards bodies.
CSA sees itself as a cloud security standards incubator, so its research projects use rapid development techniques to
produce fast results. To this end, the CSA Guidance editorial team is proud to present the third version of its flagship
“Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing.” This work is a set of best security practices CSA has
put together for 14 domains involved in governing or operating the cloud (Cloud Architecture, Governance and
Enterprise Risk Management, Legal: Contracts and Electronic Discovery, Compliance and Audit, Information
Management and Data Security, Portability and Interoperability, Traditional Security, Business Continuity and Disaster
Recovery, Data Center Operations, Incident Response, Notification and Remediation, Application Security, Encryption
and Key Management, Identity and Access Management, Virtualization, and Security as a Service).
CSA guidance in its third edition seeks to establish a stable, secure baseline for cloud operations. This effort provides a
practical, actionable road map to managers wanting to adopt the cloud paradigm safely and securely. Domains have
been rewritten to emphasize security, stability, and privacy, ensuring corporate privacy in a multi-tenant environment.
Over the past two years, version 2.1 of the guidance has served as the foundation for research in multiple areas of cloud
security. Deliverables now in use from the TCI Architecture to the GRC Stack were inspired by previous versions of the
guidance, and it is our hope that this version will be no different. The guidance serves as a high level primer for chief
executives, consumers, and implementers wishing to adopt cloud services as an alternative or supplement to traditional
infrastructure. However, the guidance is designed with innovation in mind. Those with an entrepreneurial mindset
should read this work with an eye toward the inferred services and approaches many of the authors have included in the
domain creation. Investors and corporate decision makers will also find this work of interest, as it serves as a roadmap
for innovation and development already in place in companies throughout the world. Security practitioners and
educators will find elements of this book both authoritative and thought provoking, and as the industry evolves, the
value the authors have included should prove influential and timely.
In the third edition, the guidance assumes a structural maturity in parallel with multinational cloud standards
development in both structure and content. Version 3.0 extends the content included in previous versions with practical
recommendations and requirements that can be measured and audited. Please note that different interpretations of
the term "requirements" exist, which we use throughout the document. Our guidance does not represent a statutory
obligation, but "requirements" was chosen to represent guidance appropriate for virtually all use cases we could
envision, and also aligns our guidance with similar well-accepted documents. CSA industry expert authors have
endeavored to present a working product that is measured and balanced between the interests of cloud providers and
tenants. Controls focus on the preservation of tenant data ownership integrity while embracing the concept of a shared
physical infrastructure. Guidance Version 3.0 incorporates the highly dynamic nature of cloud computing, industry
learning curve, and new developments within other research projects such as Cloud Controls Matrix, Consensus
Assessments Initiative, Trusted Cloud Initiative, and GRC Stack Initiative and ties in the various CSA activities into one
comprehensive C-level best practice. The Security Guidance v3.0 will serve as the gateway to emerging standards being

developed in the world’s standards organization and is designed to serve as an executive-level primer to any
organization seeking a secure, stable transition to hosting their business operations in the cloud.
On behalf of the Cloud Security Alliance, we would like to thank each and every volunteer for their time and effort in the
development and editing of this new release of our flagship guidance document. While we believe this is our best, most
widely reviewed work to date, the topic is still evolving and although our foremost intent is to guide, we also intend to
inspire the readers to become involved in improving and commenting on the direction those composing the body of
work have outlined. We humbly and respectfully submit this effort to the industry and await the most important
component of any dialog, your opinion. We are eager to hear your feedback regarding this updated guidance. If you
found this guidance helpful or would like to see it improved, please consider joining the Cloud Security Alliance as a
member or contributor.
Best Regards,

关于风险的编者按
Throughout this Guidance we make extensive recommendations on reducing your risk when adopting cloud computing,
but not all the recommendations are necessary or even realistic for all cloud deployments. As we compiled information
from the different working groups during the editorial process, we quickly realized there simply wasn’t enough space to
provide fully nuanced recommendations for all possible risk scenarios. Just as a critical application might be too
important to move to a public cloud provider, there might be little or no reason to apply extensive security controls to
low-value data migrating to cloud-based storage.
With so many different cloud deployment options — including the SPI service models (SPI refers to Software as a
Service, Platform as a Service, or Infrastructure as a Service, explained in depth in Domain 1); public vs. private
deployments, internal vs. external hosting, and various hybrid permutations — no list of security controls can cover all
circumstances. As with any security area, organizations should adopt a risk-based approach to moving to the cloud and
selecting security options. The following is a simple framework to help evaluate initial cloud risks and inform security
decisions.
This process is not a full risk assessment framework, nor a methodology for determining all your security requirements.
It’s a quick method for evaluating your tolerance for moving an asset to various cloud computing models.
Identify the Asset for the Cloud Deployment
At the simplest, assets supported by the cloud fall into two general categories:
1. Data
2. Applications/Functions/Processes
We are either moving information into the cloud, or transactions/processing (from partial functions all the way up to full
applications).
With cloud computing our data and applications don’t need to reside in the same location, and we can choose to shift
only parts of functions to the cloud. For example, we can host our application and data in our own data center, while still
outsourcing a portion of its functionality to the cloud through a Platform as a Service.
The first step in evaluating risk for the cloud is to determine exactly what data or function is being considered for the
cloud. This should include potential uses of the asset once it moves to the cloud to account for scope creep. Data and
transaction volumes are often higher than expected.
Evaluate the Asset
The next step is to determine how important the data or function is to the organization. You don’t need to perform a
detailed valuation exercise unless your organization has a process for that, but you do need at least a rough assessment
of how sensitive an asset is, and how important an application/function/process is.

For each asset, ask the following questions:
1. How would we be harmed if the asset became widely public and widely distributed?
2. How would we be harmed if an employee of our cloud provider accessed the asset?
3. How would we be harmed if the process or function were manipulated by an outsider?
4. How would we be harmed if the process or function failed to provide expected results?
5. How would we be harmed if the information/data were unexpectedly changed?
6. How would we be harmed if the asset were unavailable for a period of time?
Essentially we are assessing confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements for the asset; and how the risk
changes if all or part of the asset is handled in the cloud. It’s very similar to assessing a potential outsourcing project,
except that with cloud computing we have a wider array of deployment options, including internal models.
Map the Asset to Potential Cloud Deployment Models
Now we should have an understanding of the asset’s importance. Our next step is to determine which deployment
models we are comfortable with. Before we start looking at potential providers, we should know if we can accept the
