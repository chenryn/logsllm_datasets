the ﬁrst run, we selected 4 feature templates (2 from
each run) and computed again the EER by consid-
ering only the cross matching scores of ﬁngerprints
from different runs7. The process was repeated 3
times with different feature templates from the two
runs to validate the feature stability.
2. We trained the system over the ﬁrst 20 transpon-
ders and then used the obtained linear transforma-
tion to estimate the accuracy over the remaining 30
transponders. This analysis tests the stability of the
obtained linear transformations to discriminate in-
dependent transponder populations8.
7This procedure is required in order to remove any possible bias
from cross matching scores of ﬁngerprints from the same run. We
point out that this results in a reduced number of genuine and imposter
matchings for the EER computation, 200 and 9800 respectively (see
Table 3).
8The motivation behind this division (20 vs. 30) is that it gives
Figure 8 compares the EER accuracy obtained with
the ﬁrst run (Run 1) and the accuracy obtained by mix-
ing ﬁngerprints of both runs (Run 1×2) for a ﬁxed N=15.
Table 3 displays the conﬁdence interval for subspace di-
mension of 5 eigenvectors. The obtained EERs do not
show a statistically signiﬁcant difference between the
two experiments for both the burst and sweep features
using 4-fold validation.
Figure 9 displays the EER accuracy obtained using in-
dependent transponder sets for training and testing for
a ﬁxed N=15. Here, the ﬁngerprints from both runs
are mixed as in the previous analysis. Table 4 summa-
rizes the numeric results together with conﬁdence in-
tervals of the EER. Even though the testing population
(30 transponders) is smaller, we observe that the sweep
features do not show any signiﬁcant accuracy deviation
from the benchmark accuracy on Run 1×2 (Table 3). On
the other hand, the burst features slightly decreased the
accuracy on average (Table 3). The reason for this might
be that 20 different transponders are not sufﬁcient to train
the system; however, we cannot assert this with certainty.
5.3.4 Combining Sweep and Burst Features
Given that the identiﬁcation accuracies of both burst and
sweep spectral features are similar; in order to fully char-
acterize the identity veriﬁcation we computed the ROC
curves for the burst and sweep features as shown in Fig-
ure 9b. We notice that while the EERs are similar, the
curves exhibit different accuracies at different FARs. In
particular, for low FAR≤1% the sweep features show
lower GAR.
The burst and sweep features discriminate the ﬁnger-
prints in a different way, and therefore these features can
be combined in order to further increase the accuracy.
Such combinations are being researched in multi-modal
reasonable number of transponders for both training and testing.

biometrics [42] where different ”modalities” (e.g., ﬁn-
gerprint and vein) are combined to increase the identiﬁ-
cation accuracy and bring more robustness to the identi-
ﬁcation process [42].
A number of integration strategies have been proposed
based on decision rules [32], logistic functions to map
output scores into a single overall score [24], etc. Fig-
ure 9 shows the EERs and ROC curves of feature combi-
nation by using the sum as an integration function. The
overall matching score between a test and a reference
template is the sum of the matching scores obtained sep-
arately for the burst and sweep features. Table 5 summa-
rizes the results.
For the benchmark datasets (Run 1), we observe
signiﬁcant improvement of the accuracy reaching an
EER=2.43%. The improvement is also signiﬁcant for all
target FARs (e.g., 0.1%, 1%) as shown in Figure 9b. We
also observe a statistically signiﬁcant improvement on
using ﬁngerprints from both Run 1 and 2. The accuracy
is slightly lower (EER=4.38%). These results motivate
further research on feature modalities and novel integra-
tion strategies.
5.4 Summary and Discussion
In this section, we have experimentally analyzed the clas-
siﬁcation and identiﬁcation capabilities of three different
physical-layer features with related signal acquisition,
feature extraction and matching procedures.
The results show that classiﬁcation can successfully
be achieved using the modulation shape of the transpon-
der’s response to a wake-up command at an out-of-
speciﬁcation frequency (e.g., Fc=13.06 MHz). This
technique is fast, does not require special hardware and
can be applied without statistically training the classiﬁ-
cation process.
For identiﬁcation, we proposed using spectral features
extracted from the transponder’s reaction to purpose-
built burst and linear frequency sweep signals. Our pro-
posed signal acquisition and feature extraction/matching
techniques achieved separately an identiﬁcation accu-
racy of approximately EER=5% over 50 identical RFID
transponders. The proposed features are stable across ac-
quisition runs. In addition, our spectral features showed
that they can be combined in order to further improve the
accuracy to EER=2.43%.
The results also conﬁrm that using the ﬁrst 5 eigenvec-
tors is sufﬁcient to represent the proposed features while
keeping the identiﬁcation accuracy high. Therefore, our
proposed features also form very compact and compu-
tationally efﬁcient ﬁngerprints. Typically, if each dimen-
sion is represented by a 4-byte ﬂoating-point number, the
size of the corresponding feature template h = { ˆG; ΣG}
is 20 (5×4) bytes for ˆG and 100 (5x5x4) bytes for the
square covariance matrix ΣG resulting in a total of 120
bytes.
In terms of feature extraction performance, given the
much lower dimensionality of the burst samples (40000
vs. 960000 for the sweep), they are much faster to digi-
tally acquire and extract with approximately 2 sec. com-
pared to 26 sec. for the sweep data samples. The times
are measured on a machine with 2.00 GHz CPU, 2 GB
RAM running Linux Ubuntu. It should be noted that all
the components of the feature extraction can be imple-
mented efﬁciently in hardware which would signiﬁcantly
improve the performance.
6 Application to Cloning Detection
The classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation results presented in
Section 5 indicate that physical-layer ﬁngerprinting can
be practical in a controlled environment. In this section,

we discuss how it could be used in the context of product
or document cloning detection. We point out however
that the cloning detection will obey to the achieved er-
ror rates. Despite a number of protective measures, it
has been recently shown [18, 34, 33, 47] that even RFID
transponders in electronic identity documents can be suc-
cessfully cloned, even if the full range of protective mea-
sures speciﬁed by the standard [3], including active au-
thentication, is used. We consider the physical-layer ﬁn-
gerprinting described in this work as an additional ef-
ﬁcient mechanism that can be used to detect document
counterfeiting.
We foresee two use cases in which ﬁngerprints can
be applied for anti-counterfeiting. In the ﬁrst use case,
the ﬁngerprints are measured before RFID deployment
and are stored in a back-end database, indexed with the
unique transponder (document) identiﬁer. When the au-
thenticity of the document with identiﬁer ID is veriﬁed,
the ﬁngerprint of the document transponder is measured,
and then compared with the corresponding transponder
ﬁngerprint of document ID stored in the database.
In
order to successfully clone the document, the attacker
needs to perform two tasks:
1. Obtain the ﬁngerprint template of the transponder
in the original document and
2. Produce or ﬁnd a document (transponder) with the
same ﬁngerprint.
In order to extract a ﬁngerprint template the attacker
needs to fully control the target document (hold it in
possession) for long enough to complete the extraction.
Using the methods from our study, it would be hard, if
not infeasible, for the attacker to extract the same ﬁn-
gerprints remotely (e.g., from few meters away). In our
