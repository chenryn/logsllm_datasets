# 20. GameOver/Zeus
GameOver/Zeus attempted to obfuscate its activities by leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols, thereby avoiding single points of failure, similar to how traditional P2P file-sharing services operate (loosely based on Kademlia DHT techniques). Zeus employed a basic rolling XOR for packet payloads, making signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) less effective. This example underscores that malware authors often aim to stay one step ahead of security solutions rather than implementing the most advanced attacks.

# 21. Dridex Using Pastebin as C2 (aka Blind Drop)
Virtually any cloud service can be used for Command and Control (C2) operations. In this example, Pastebin is leveraged. While sites like Pastebin might be simple to shut down, platforms such as Twitter, Amazon, and Facebook may have legitimate business purposes, making them more challenging to block. Malware can hide in comments, images, videos, and other uploaded content.

# 22. Dalexis: ToR as a C2 Channel
After an initial infection, the malware switches to TOR2Web, a clientless implementation of The Onion Router (TOR), for C2 activities. This allows botnet operators to evade communication snooping on intermediate systems.

**Stages:**
- **Initial Compromise**
- **Probing for TOR Endpoint**
- **C2 Connection via Tor2Web**

# 23. AridViper
AridViper is a targeted malware that uses basic HTTP over standard ports to blend in with normal traffic. The communication stream includes initial client registration to the C2 server and post-registration activity to validate interesting files on the system. Initially, AridViper focused on Israeli targets.

# 24. C2 Trends and Projections: Encryption
- **SSL Adoption:** SSL adoption has rapidly increased, with SandVine projecting 70% encryption in 2016.
- **Let’s Encrypt:** This initiative could be a game-changer for malware, as it eliminates the high cost and overhead previously associated with SSL.
- **Impact:** While state-sponsored or targeted attacks may not be significantly affected, crimeware will likely see a substantial impact.

# 25. C2 Trends and Projections: IPv6
- **Current Status:** IPv4 remains the predominant routed protocol on the internet, especially outside of APAC and universities, but this is changing.
- **Challenges:** IPv6 presents a significant challenge due to the massive number of addresses. For example, Hurricane Electric provides a /48 prefix, which equates to 65,535 /64 networks, each with 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 hosts.
- **Security Concerns:** IPv6 may expose weaknesses in security software that does not support it or has underlying flaws and vulnerabilities.
- **Default Enablement:** IPv6 is enabled by default in virtually every modern operating system.

# 26. C2 Trends and Projections: TOR
- **Increasing Usage:** We are seeing an increase in malware using TOR.
- **Ideal Concealment:** TOR is an ideal channel for concealing C2 communications.
- **Tor2Web:** Even without a client, TOR can be implemented using Tor2Web.

# 27. Leveraging Cloud Apps
- **Hiding C2 in Cloud/Web Apps:** This trend is likely to continue, as it helps attackers avoid the challenges of hosting and potential blacklisting of standalone C2 infrastructure by overlaying it on top of cloud applications, which often have legitimate business use.
- **Detection Challenges:** This makes detection harder and limits organizations' ability to take action, as they cannot block these apps.
- **Cloud Provider Responsibility:** The onus is on cloud providers to detect malicious activity, with varying effectiveness depending on their investment in security.
- **Ease of Deployment:** Cloud apps can be deployed with little more than an email address, often providing free compute infrastructure for attackers.

# 28. Layered Evasions: Ripe for the Picking
- **Layered Evasions:** Stacking numerous evasion techniques from the IP level up to the application layer to evade detection.
- **Techniques:**
  - IP Fragmentation
  - TCP Segment Overlaps
  - SSL Encryption
  - HTTP: Chunking, GZIP, Base64, Embedded Content (Encoding, Compression, Metadata, Dynamic Content)
  - IP Protocol 41 (IPv6 in IPv4)

# 29. Steg Adoption
- **Steganography:** Hiding data in plain sight is a powerful covert channel.
- **Techniques:** Attackers may use methods that are not computationally difficult to generate but are hard to detect, especially in real-time network streams.
- **Trends:** Likely dictated by the pace of security industry defenses.

# 30. C2 Detection Is Critical!
- **High Fidelity Indicators:** Can prevent malware from executing, escalating attacks, and exfiltrating sensitive data.
- **Defensive Benefits:** Makes more hurdles for the attacker, increasing the chances of detection and mistakes.

# 31. Defense Mechanisms Part 1
- **Eliminate the Known Bad:**
  - Block access to known bad IPs and countries.
  - Block access to malicious domains and URLs.
- **Minimize the Network Attack Surface:**
  - Restrict firewall and next-generation firewall (NGFW) rules to least privilege.
  - Block unnecessary or undesirable L7 applications.
  - Block unknown or unknown encrypted applications at the perimeter.
  - Use NGFW and IPS to identify low-hanging fruit and potential protocol anomalies.

**Malware C2 Channels by Port:**
- TCP Port 80: 78.23%
- TCP Port 443: 4.00%
- TCP/UDP Port 1024: 1.84%

# 32. Defense Mechanisms Part 2
- **Fingerprint Known Malware:**
  - Identify malware using both pattern matching and behavioral identification from high-fidelity sources.
  - Accurate identification of malware, especially through its C2 channel, increases confidence in detecting infections.

# 33. Defense Mechanisms Part 3
- **Eliminate SSL Blind Spot with Interception:**
  - SSL interception is increasingly important for inspecting encrypted streams and breaking malware using predefined certificates or unsupported configurations.
  - Limit trusted CA certificates on SSL proxies and endpoints to mitigate connections to suspicious systems.
  - Restrict SSL man-in-the-middle (MiTM) to strong ciphers to break malware using weak or outdated ciphers.
- **Detect/Block Known Bad SSL Certs:**
  - Use IDS or other technologies to detect known malicious SSL certs.
  - Record TLS certificates observed on the network using tools like Suricata or Bro.
  - [Abuse.CH](https://abuse.ch/)

# 34. Defense Mechanisms Part 4
- **Heuristics/Anomaly Detection:**
  - Heuristics and pattern matching, while not perfect, can be effective when combined with other indicators of compromise (IOCs).
  - Examine DNS data to identify domain generation algorithms used by modern malware.
  - Place IDS between the client and the DNS server for accurate detection.
- **Network Anomaly Detection:**
  - While prone to false positives, anomaly detection can provide valuable insights, especially when combined with other techniques.
  - Effective against network-based steganography and evasion techniques.

# 35. Defense Mechanisms: Part 5
- **Review, Tune, and Listen to Your Security Infrastructure:**
  - High-profile breaches often involve detected but unaddressed malicious activity.
  - Many off-the-shelf malware and attacks provide multiple IOCs that can be detected by freely available software and systems.
  - Commercial and open-source solutions can help manage signal-to-noise, auxiliary endpoint verification, and end-to-end incident response (IR) containment.

# 37. Summary
- **Modern Computer Security:** It's not a matter of if, but when, and what they will take, and how much it will cost you to deal with it.
- **Attack Surface:** The attack surface is too large to rely solely on keeping malware out.
- **Holistic Detection:** Detect breaches not only in the initial phases but also where attackers are most exposed, such as C2 channels.
- **Adaptation:** As we improve our defenses, malicious actors will adapt, finding new ways to leverage technology for malicious purposes.
- **Economic Impact:** By making their job harder, we can tip the economics of hacking in our favor, exploiting them at their weakest point, the C2 channel.
