It seems like you want to extract and present the pattern from a log message. Here is an optimized version of your text, making it more clear and professional:

**Original Log Message:**
```
Using tsc for high-res timesource
```

**Extracted Pattern:**
```
Pattern: Using [timesource] for [purpose]
Example: Using tsc for high-res timesource
```

This format clearly identifies the structure of the log message and provides an example for reference.
