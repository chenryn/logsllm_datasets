## JumpCloud {#c08.xhtml#head-2-59}
According to Zach DeMeyer at JumpCloud, "Generally endpoint management
solutions have focused solely on managing the system, not including
identities and access." JumpCloud is a cutting‐edge blend of SSO and
management of permissions in a network. Users\' identities are at the
core of JumpCloud as a directory as a service. You create a central,
authoritative version of each identity so employees can use a single set
of credentials throughout all the resources they need to access. You can
set up password complexity and expiration features to ensure policies
are met and then, once set up, bind those users to any of the resources
connected to JumpCloud from their host system to applications to
networks.
To get started, go to `jumpcloud.com` and create your user account. Your
first ten users are completely free, forever. After that, there is a
small charge per user. Once your user account is validated through your
email, you have access to the central console where you can set up
credentials for platform, protocol, or location. You can use JumpCloud
to enforce policies, set password requirements including multifactor
authentication, and streamline access to most IT resources. [Lab
8.1](#c08.xhtml#c08-fea-0001){#c08.xhtml#R_c08-fea-0001} shows how to
create a user, and [Lab

[]{#c08.xhtml#Page_106 .pagebreak title="106" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
lock screen can help you not fall victim to donut day. *Donut day* is
when you leave your computer unlocked, step away or turn your back for a
moment, and someone takes advantage of you being logged in. That person
will send an email to everyone saying, "I\'m bringing the donuts
tomorrow!" Everyone knows you left the machine unlocked. Some
organizations I\'ve worked for had a prank []{#c08.xhtml#Page_107
.pagebreak title="107" role="doc-pagebreak"}where they would change our
wallpaper to My Little Pony and called it getting *pwned*. You must lock
your computer, and if you forget, a policy can do it for you. It can be
an expensive lesson to bring donuts for 250 people. In [Figure
8.7](#c08.xhtml#c08-fig-0007){#c08.xhtml#R_c08-fig-0007}, you see the
Windows Lock Screen policy and the ability to set the timeout in
seconds. Again, you have to balance the CIA triad with usability. I have
seen an executive, frustrated with the lockout policy, place a
"perpetual drinking bird" next to his keyboard to peck his keyboard and
simulate activity so he didn\'t have to type in his password every 60
seconds.
![[**[Figure 8.7](#c08.xhtml#R_c08-fig-0007){#c08.xhtml#c08-fig-0007

policy](Images/c08f007.jpg){.center width="751" height="576"}
Now that you have a user, a system, and a policy, it\'s time to evaluate
groups, applications, and directories. Each of these will have its own
impact on the security posture of your organization. With groups, you
have the ability to provide your users and admins access to resources
while pulling them into a central management portal. To add another
layer of security, giving users the ability to use SSO to sign into an
application will enhance these processes. Finally, building a directory
will allow you to synchronize user accounts and enable JumpCloud to act
as a single authoritative directory of users.
[]{#c08.xhtml#Page_108 .pagebreak title="108" role="doc-pagebreak"}The
goal is to work your way through the CIS controls. CIS Control 5 is
controlling IM and AM. With controlled use of the correct privileges on
computers, networks, and applications, you protect information and
assets from theft and misuse. It becomes even more important because you
have to deal with the monumental outside threat but also insiders doing
things they shouldn\'t be doing. It can be a daunting task, but it is
essential.

When I was growing up, my older brother was a Trekkie, a *Star Trek*
fan. James T. Kirk, the captain of the U.S.S. *Enterprise*, would make
entries into a captain\'s log. The captain\'s log has been a form of
record keeping since the first captains sailed the seas. The log was
used to inform the captain\'s superiors, either owners of the ship or
governmental entities, what was happening while exploring or completing
a mission or to record historical facts for future generations. Our
networks work the same way. Every device on your network generates some
type of log‐in some type of language. Some of it is human readable, and
some looks like gibberish. Some logs are more useful than others, and we
should understand which ones need to be preserved for future analysis.
You don\'t need to log everything, but what you do log should be
purposely collected and managed.
CIS Control 6 is the maintenance, monitoring, and analysis of audit
logs. Our organizations are evolving quickly, and we have to learn to
deal with log data in the big data cloud era. Analyzing audit logs is a
vital part of security, not just for system security but for processes
and compliance. Part of the process of log analysis is reconciling logs
from different sources and correlation even if those devices are in
different time zones. If you look at a basic network topology, you will
have many types of devices, including routers, switches, firewalls,
servers, []{#c09.xhtml#Page_110 .pagebreak title="110"
role="doc-pagebreak"}and workstations. Each of these devices that helps
connect you to the rest of the world will generate logs based on its
operating systems, configuration, and software. Examining logs is one of
the most effective ways of looking for issues and troubleshooting issues
occurring on a system or an application.
Synchronization and the ability to correlate the data between these
devices are vital to a healthy environment. When I first started in IT,
you could get away with occasionally using logs for troubleshooting.
Attackers can hide their activities on machines if logging is not done
correctly; therefore, you need a strategic method of consolidating and
auditing all your logs. Without solid audit log analysis, an attack can
go unnoticed for a long time. According to the 2018 Verizon Data Breach
Investigations Report, 87 percent of compromises took minutes or less to
occur, and 68 percent went undiscovered for months. The full report was
based on detailed analysis of more than 53,000 security incidents,
including 2,216 data breaches. You can download the full details at
`verizonenterprise.com/DBIR2018`.

## Windows Event Viewer {#c09.xhtml#head-2-62}
A Windows event log is one of the first tools to use to learn to analyze
problems. As a security administrator, you must ensure that local
logging is enabled on systems and networking devices. The process that
can create an audit log is usually required to run in privileged mode so
that users cannot stop or change it. To view logs on a Windows asset
through a graphic user interface (GUI) like you see in [Figure
9.1](#c09.xhtml#c09-fig-0001){#c09.xhtml#R_c09-fig-0001}, you have to
open the Event Viewer.

[]{#c09.xhtml#Page_111 .pagebreak title="111"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Events are placed into three different categories,
each of which is related to a log that Windows keeps. While there are a
lot of categories, the majority of troubleshooting and investigation
happens in the application, system, or security log.
-   [**Application** The application log records events related to
    Windows components like drivers.]{#c09.xhtml#c09-li-0006}
-   [**System** The system log records events about programs
    installed.]{#c09.xhtml#c09-li-0007}
-   [**Security** When security logging is enabled, this log records
    events related to security, such as logon attempts and resources
    accessed.]{#c09.xhtml#c09-li-0008}
