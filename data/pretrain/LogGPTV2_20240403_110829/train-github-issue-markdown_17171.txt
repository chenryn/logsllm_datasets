  * Neo4j version: 3.3.3-1 installed through yum
  * Operating system: centos 7
  * API/Driver: neo4j-admin import
I'm loading a large (1M+ records with 40 fields) csv file with the following
(simplified) command:  
neo4j-admin import  
\--nodes:Organization /path/to/organizations.csv  
\--multiline-fields=true  
\--ignore-duplicate-nodes=true  
\--ignore-missing-nodes=true  
\--array-delimiter ";"
And since a couple of weeks it regularly fails with:
    WARNING Import failed. The store files in /path/to/graph.db are left as they are, although they are likely in an unusable state. Starting a database on these store files will likely fail or observe inconsistent records so start at your own risk or delete the store manually
    unexpected error: ERROR in input
      data source: BufferedCharSeeker[source:/path/to/organizations.csv, position:301989889, line:1100684]
      in field: abbreviationFr:string:6
      for header: [vat:ID(Organization), ... , abbreviationFr:string, ...]
      raw field value: ??
      original error: String index out of range: -1
This error occurs deterministically in the sense that once it happens it will
consistently happen with the same input. However, it may just go away after
simply reordering the fields, removing a line or sometimes even a cell. I have
tried to isolate the issue by only taking the lines around the line number
mentioned in the error as the input but I havent been able to reproduce the
error in this way.
The csv file itself should be valid csv since it was generated from Spark.
Any idea what could be wrong? Did you make any changes to the import in the
recent versions? Anything I can do to pinpoint the issue?
Thanks in advance,
Niek.
