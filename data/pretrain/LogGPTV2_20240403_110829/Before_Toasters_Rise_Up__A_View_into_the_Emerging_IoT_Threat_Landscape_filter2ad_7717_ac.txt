### Remote Management Web Interfaces and Authentication

Remote management web interfaces require authentication, which assumes that attackers have already obtained valid credentials and are aware of the specific device they are interacting with. Furthermore, we typically observe that when attackers access more than one page on a given web interface, they do not request non-existent pages. This indicates that they are either navigating through the web interface or have prior knowledge of the available pages.

### IoT Device Infection

In the previous section, we described some of the reconnaissance and intrusion mechanisms used by cybercriminals to gain control over IoT devices. This is usually the first step in a multi-stage attack, ultimately leading to compromised devices being used for malicious activities. In this section, we will discuss the second stage of an IoT device takeover, where attackers prepare the device for monetization by running malicious code. This code often (i) attempts to spread itself by exploiting other devices and (ii) joins the Command and Control (C&C) channel of an existing botnet.

To study the infection mechanisms against our IoT honeypots, we focused on telnet, which is the most common intrusion method observed. We extracted all commands issued by attackers from each telnet connection to our two high-interaction honeypots: the Netgear router and the Brickcom IP camera. After removing empty connections and those where attackers failed to log in, we were left with 169,804 out of 611,429 (27.77%) connections. We then filtered out short connections with fewer than two commands, resulting in 93,099 (15.23% of the total) connections. Each sequence of commands was transformed into an unordered set, leading to 8,167 unique telnet sessions. These sessions were clustered using the DBSCAN algorithm with the Jaccard index to compute similarity. The clustering results are summarized in Table 4.

#### Clustering Results

- **Cluster A**: The largest cluster with over 45K connections, containing more than 5K unique sessions. It is linked to multiple malware families, including Mirai, Aidra, Kaiten, and Gafgyt.
- **Cluster B**: Contains about 10K connections attributable to Mirai and Masuta. Masuta, a recent variant of Mirai, emerged in late 2017. The command sequences for Mirai and Masuta are nearly identical, indicating their shared origins.
- **Cluster E**: Related to the "vigilante" botnet Hajime. Hajime is known for its sophisticated, P2P-operated structure and infects devices by brute-forcing credentials. Unlike other botnets, Hajime can download binaries or use the "echo load" technique to rebuild the binary.

### Telnet Commands and Honeypot Interactions

Attackers executing commands on low-interaction honeypots tend to issue more unique commands. This may be due to the default behavior of these honeypots, which returns empty results, prompting attackers to explore alternative methods to deliver binaries, such as tftp.

Analyzing telnet commands during the infection phase provides a way to fingerprint attackers and attribute them to specific threats or botnets. This fine-grained profiling can aid in the detection and investigation of IoT threats, such as when writing Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

### Dropped Files Analysis

Over six months, our honeypots collected 3,385 files dropped by attackers. The most common techniques for dropping files include downloading binaries via HTTP or FTP and the "echo load" technique. Malware families identified include Mirai, Hajime, and Gafgyt. Table 5 summarizes the normalized AV detections of the dropped binaries.

- **Mirai**: Represents the largest set (47.5%) of binaries.
- **Hajime**: 24.4% of the binaries.
- **Gafgyt**: 13.7% of the binaries.

We also observed a mix of old and new botnets, with some samples being short-lived and others persisting for weeks or months.

### Malicious File Downloads

A total of 2,837 binaries were downloaded from 832 different IP addresses hosted in 146 ASes. At least 90% of malware download servers are short-lived, with a lifetime of less than five days. This is supported by the fact that 60% of malware-distributing IP addresses were never blacklisted during the six-month data collection period. Additionally, 40% of IP addresses are located in only five different ASes associated with large national ISPs providing hosting and cloud services.

### Post-Infection Traffic

Table 6 lists the top 10 ports in terms of post-infection traffic volume for the Netgear router and the Brickcom IP camera.

By analyzing these various aspects of IoT device infections, we can better understand the threat landscape and develop more effective strategies for detection and mitigation.
