Table 5: BGP vs. traceroute AS paths for different AS mapping techniques
3.3 Comparing BGP and Traceroute Paths
To map IP addresses to AS numbers, we ﬁrst applied the
whois.ra.net data that form the basis of the “NANOG traceroute”
tool [13]; the whois.arin.net, whois.ripe.net, and whois.apnic.net
data were not appropriate for our purposes since these services do
not provide the AS number associated with an IP address. Un-
fortunately, the whois.ra.net data are out-of-date and incomplete.
The statistics in “Whois Data” columns in Table 5 show that the
BGP and traceroute AS paths matched less than half of the time.
Incorrect IP-to-AS mappings may be responsible for many of the
“mismatches” with the BGP AS path. Many traceroute paths were
“incomplete” because no mapping exists in the whois database for
some of the router hops. Around 20–33% of the traceroute paths
had “unmapped” IP addresses that whois could not associate with
an AS; this is partially explained by ASes that have not updated
whois to reﬂect their current address assignments.
To improve the IP-to-AS mapping, we combined BGP routing
table data from many vantage points. Combining multiple routing
tables provides (i) a richer view of different subnets that may be
aggregated at other locations, (ii) a more complete picture of pre-
ﬁxes associated with multiple origin ASes, and (iii) a lower risk
of missing certain preﬁxes due to transient reachability problems
at any one router. Table 6 lists the number of preﬁxes in each
BGP routing table, along with the number of preﬁxes with more
than one origin AS. The RouteViews data [22] consisted of BGP
routes learned from 23 participating ASes, mostly in the United
States. The data from the RIPE-NCC Routing Information Ser-
vice project [23] provided BGP routes from 75 ASes, mostly in
Europe. The SingAREN routers [24] had BGP routes from ASes
in the Asia-Paciﬁc region. Each of the other tables provided BGP
routes seen from one vantage point. All of the BGP tables were
collected around May 29, 2003, in the middle of our traceroute ex-
periments, to limit the effects of changes in the mapping of preﬁxes
to origin ASes over time. Combining all of the tables produced a
mapping with more than 200,000 preﬁxes and 16,000 ASes. About
10% of the preﬁxes mapped to multiple origin ASes.
Using the collection of BGP tables increased the “match” rate
and substantially decreased the fraction of paths with “unmapped
hops,” as shown in the “Combined BGP Tables” columns in Ta-
ble 5. This occurred because the BGP tables from the operational
routers provide a more complete and up-to-date view of the “own-
ership” of the IP addresses appearing in the traceroute paths. Still,
the BGP and traceroute AS paths agreed less than 73% of the time,
even under our relatively liberal notion of “matching” (i.e., after
trimming the end of the traceroute paths). Less than 8.3% of the
traceroute AS paths differ from the corresponding BGP AS path. In
the remaining cases, the traceroute path was “incomplete” because
one or more hops did not map directly to a single AS number:
Unmapped hop: In a few (< 3.0%) of the paths, some hops had

Table 6: BGP tables for IP-to-AS mapping around May 2003
an address that did not match any preﬁx in the set of BGP tables.
Private IP addresses accounted for less than 40% of the cases. Un-
mapped hops can arise when interfaces are assigned addresses that
are not advertised to the larger Internet.
“*” hop: Many traceroute paths had one or more “*” characters,
even after removing trailing “*” characters at the end of the path.
A “*” hop may stem from a lost probe or ICMP packet, or from an
intermediate node that does not participate in ICMP.
Multiple origin AS hop: Around 9–13% of the traceroute paths
had at least one interface address that mapped to multiple AS num-
bers, making direct comparisons with the BGP path impossible.
MOAS preﬁxes occur for various reasons including misconﬁgura-
tion, multihoming, or exchange points [16].
The three cases are not mutually exclusive; a single traceroute path
may have hops with one or more of these properties.
4. RESOLVING INCOMPLETE PATHS
This section describes and evaluates three simple techniques for
analyzing a large fraction of the “incomplete” traceroute AS paths,
as summarized in the “Resolving Incompletes” columns in Table 5.
We discuss how to use internal router conﬁguration ﬁles to validate
the results, using data from a large service provider (AT&T, AS
7018) as an example. The conﬁguration data enables us to verify
whether certain interfaces belong to a particular AS and what lies
on the other side of a link. We also can identify static routes that are
used to direct trafﬁc to speciﬁc customers. Our validation scripts
could be used to compute statistics for other networks, without re-
quiring these ASes to divulge their raw conﬁguration ﬁles.
4.1 Unresolved Hops Within an AS
Many of the incomplete paths have “*” or unmapped hops in be-
tween two hops that map to the same AS; for example, a path may
have one or more “*” hops between two interfaces that both map
to AS 1239. We assume that such “*” and unmapped hops belong
to the same AS as the surrounding hops; that is, we convert a path
with hops “1239 * 1239” to a single AS-level hop of 1239. This
is similar to the approach in [10] of clustering routers in a graph
based on the AS number and associating each “*” interface with
the nearest cluster. This simple heuristic reduced the number of in-
complete paths with “*” hops by 30–40%. For unmapped hops, it
reduced the incomplete paths by about 40%.
To test our hypothesis, we investigated the traceroute paths that
appear to have one or more “*” hops within AS 7018 (i.e., path
segments such as “7018 * 7018” or “7018 * * 7018”). We in-
spect the IP address of the last hop in the path segment—the ﬁrst
hop after the “*” hops. We assume that this IP address corre-
sponds to one end of the link from the previous router; the other
end of the link should have the same network address. For ex-
ample, a point-to-point link with the preﬁx 192.0.2.156/30 would
have two interfaces with addresses of 192.0.2.157 and 192.0.2.158;
192.0.2.156 and 192.0.2.159 would correspond to the network and
broadcast addresses, respectively. Upon seeing a hop with IP ad-
dress 192.0.2.157, we look for another interface on a different
router with IP address 192.0.2.158. In 98.1% of the cases, we are
able to identify the router associated with this interface and ver-
ify that this router belongs to AS 7018. The remaining 1.9% of
cases may have stemmed from transient routing changes where the
hops in the traceroute path did not represent a single consistent path
through the network.
4.2 Unmapped Hops Between ASes
Most of the unmapped hops appeared between interfaces that
are mapped to different ASes (e.g., “1239 ? ? 64”). We attempted
to associate the unmapped hop(s) with the previous or subsequent
AS, using DNS and whois data. First, we considered the sufﬁx
of the domain names associated with the interfaces (e.g., convert-
ing “sl-gw9-ana-4-0-0.sprintlink.net” to “sprintlink.net”), includ-
ing the country domain if present; reverse DNS lookups were suc-
cessful for 59% of the IP addresses in the traceroute results. If an
unmapped hop had the same DNS sufﬁx as a neighboring (mapped)
interface, we associated the unmapped hop with that AS. This is
similar to the approach in [4] of using DNS names to identify
routers belonging to the same service provider. However, DNS did
not always return a name for the unmapped hop; if some other in-
terface in the same /24 address block had a successful reverse-DNS
lookup, we used the DNS sufﬁx for that interface. Second, we used
whois to identify the AS responsible for the unmapped interface;
we used this AS mapping only when it matched one of the adjacent
ASes in the traceroute path. These techniques reduced the num-
ber of paths with unmapped hops by over 50%; these “resolved”
traceroute AS paths had about the same proportion of “matches”
with the BGP AS paths as the initial “complete” traceroute paths
did, increasing our conﬁdence in these additions to the IP-to-AS
mapping.
For this heuristic, validating with conﬁguration data involved
checking that each “?” hop mapped to AS 7018 actually corre-
sponded to the IP address assigned to an interface in that network.
However, the AS 7018 network numbers its interfaces out of an
address block that is advertised to the rest of the Internet; as such,
these interfaces did not appear as unmapped hops in the traceroute
paths, and we could not use the conﬁguration data to test the heuris-
tic. Conﬁguration data from other ASes would have been more use-
ful. Overall, though, the fraction of “?” hops resolved by this set
of heuristics was relatively low because we did not try to map “?”
hops to other AS numbers (e.g., besides adjacent AS hops like 1239
or 64). We experimented with other heuristics but did not believe
that the DNS and whois IP-to-AS mappings were accurate enough
to warrant a more liberal approach.
4.3 MOAS Hops at the End of the Path
Interface IP addresses that map to multiple origin ASes appeared
in 10–13% of the traceroute AS paths. About 3% of all traceroute
AS paths end with hops that map to multiple ASes. This can occur
due to edge networks that connect to multiple providers without
using BGP (or using private AS numbers) or due to misconﬁgura-
tions [16]. We envision that an AS traceroute tool should report that
these hops map to multiple ASes for diagnostic purposes. For the
rest of the paper, we include these traceroute paths in our compa-
rison with the corresponding BGP AS paths. We consider these
traceroute hops a “match” with the corresponding BGP hop if the
AS in the BGP path matches any one of the ASes associated with
the traceroute MOAS hops. These “resolved” traceroute AS paths
had about the same proportion of “matches” with the BGP AS paths
as the initial “complete” traceroute paths.
Using the conﬁguration data, we investigated the traceroute AS
paths where the last hop was mapped to AS 7018 and at least one
other AS. In particular, we inspected the IP preﬁxes used to map
these hops to multiple origin ASes to see if they actually corre-
sponded to customers of AS 7018. In all of the cases involving AS
7018, the preﬁx was speciﬁed in a static route associated with one
or more access links to a customer. That is, AS 7018 originated
the route to this preﬁx on behalf of a customer and, as such, the
preﬁx referred not to equipment inside the backbone but rather to
addresses in the customer’s network.
5.
IMPROVED IP-TO-AS MAPPING
After applying the techniques in Section 4, about 6–9% of the
traceroute AS paths do not match the corresponding BGP AS path
and another 6–10% have hops that map to multiple origin ASes.
We suspect that inaccuracies in the IP-to-AS mapping are respon-
sible for many of these cases. After a brief discussion of the causes
of mismatches, we propose and evaluate algorithms for detecting
IXPs, sibling ASes, and networks that do not announce routes for
their infrastructure. The coverage of some of our techniques is lim-
ited by the fact that our measurement data come from only eight
vantage points mostly in the United States, all directly connected to
large providers in North America. The techniques discussed here
and in the previous section are very efﬁcient. The algorithms re-
quire on the order of a few minutes to run on traceroute paths to
about 200,000 addresses.
5.1 Patterns and Causes of Mismatched Paths
At least two-thirds of the differences between the BGP and
traceroute AS paths fell into one of four simple patterns:
Extra AS hop: For about 30–40% of the mismatches, the tracer-
oute AS path had one extra intermediate hop that does not appear
in the corresponding BGP AS path, as shown in Figure 2(a).
Missing AS hop: About 20% of the mismatches came from tracer-
oute AS paths that were missing one intermediate hop compared to
the BGP AS path, as shown in Figure 2(b).
Two-hop AS loop: Around 10% of the traceroute AS paths had an
AS-level loop with two AS hops, such as the “H G” segment in
Figure 2(c).
Substitute AS: In 2–3% of the cases, the two paths had a different
AS for one intermediate hop, such as AS D for the traceroute path
