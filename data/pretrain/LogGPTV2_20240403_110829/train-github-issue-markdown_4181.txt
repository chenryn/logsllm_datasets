The issue encountered is unacceptable. The Python 3.7 development team should address this problem promptly (keyword mismatch).

When attempting to run `scrapy shell`, the following error occurred:

SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This error suggests that there is a syntax issue in the `twisted.conch.manhole` module, specifically with the use of `async` as a keyword argument. This is likely due to the introduction of `async` as a reserved keyword in Python 3.7.

To resolve this, the `twisted` library or the `scrapy` extension may need to be updated to be compatible with Python 3.7.
