**Steps**
  1. Clone this repo and using your shell of choice navigate to the root of the repo.
  2. Execute `npm start`. This will build and run an angular app.
  3. Once the angular app is running, execute `npm test`
When running with node `16.19.1` the output after `step 3` is:
    > demo-app@0.0.0 test
    > npx playwright test
    Running 1 test using 1 worker
      ✓  1 [chromium] › example.spec.ts:3:5 › dummy test (1.8s)
      1 passed (2.6s)
When running with node `18.16.0` the output after `step 3` is:
    > demo-app@0.0.0 test
    > npx playwright test
    [WebServer] ? Port 4200 is already in use.
    Would you like to use a different port? (Y/n) [WebServer]
    Error: Timed out waiting 30000ms from config.webServer.
As you can see, it tries to execute the `webServer.command` and then
eventually times out because the port is already taken.
**Expected**
When running on node `18.16.0` it should NOT try to execute the
`webServer.command` when `webServer.reuseExistingServer` is set to true.
**Actual**
When running on node `18.16.0` it executes the `webServer.command` when
`webServer.reuseExistingServer` is set to true.
### Other
I used nvm to swap between node versions whilst testing this.
