User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to get client to client login's log on domain server I have 100 clients that are joined to a domain. One of them is trying to do brute-force attack to the other clients. How can I get login failure logs on domain server about attacker logins?

I already enabled all audit policy settings that are related to the logins and I can see all the logs about login success/failure to the domain server but in this scenario I can not see any logs for client to client login failure.

Assistant: I have a script that can help if you are on Windows Server:

function get-logonhistory{
Param (
 #get ip(127.0.0.1) and number of days you want get
 [string]$Computer = (Read-Host IP remoto do PC),
 [int]$Days = (Read-Host number of days)
 )
 cls
 $Result = @()
 Write-Host "wait..."
 $ELogs = Get-EventLog System -Source Microsoft-Windows-WinLogon -After (Get-Date).AddDays(-$Days) -ComputerName $Computer
 If ($ELogs)
 { Write-Host "processing..."
 ForEach ($Log in $ELogs)
 { If ($Log.InstanceId -eq 7001)
   { $ET = "Logon"
   }
   ElseIf ($Log.InstanceId -eq 7002)
   { $ET = "Logoff"
   }
   Else
   { Continue
   }
   $Result += New-Object PSObject -Property @{
    Time = $Log.TimeWritten
    'Event Type' = $ET
    User = (New-Object System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier $Log.ReplacementStrings[1]).Translate([System.Security.Principal.NTAccount])
   }
 }
 $Result | Select Time,"Event Type",User | Sort Time -Descending | Out-GridView
 Write-Host "Done."
 }
 Else
 { Write-Host "Problem with ip $Computer."
 }
 }
#function call
get-logonhistory

Write-Host "Press any key ..."
#stop script to window dont close 
$x = $host.UI.RawUI.ReadKey("NoEcho,IncludeKeyDown")
