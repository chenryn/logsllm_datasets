User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Suggest methods for testing changes to "pam.d/common-*" files How do I test the changes to the pam.d configuration files:  


Do I need to restart the PAM service to test the changes?  
Should I go through every service listed in the /etc/pam.d/ directory?


I'm about to make changes to the pam.d/common-* files in an effort to put an Ubuntu box into  an active directory controlled network.

I'm just learning what to do, so I'm preparing the configuration in a VM, which I plan to deploy in metal in the coming week.  

It is a clean install of Ubuntu 10.04 Beta 2 server, so other than SSH daemon, all other services are stock.

Assistant: PAM configuration files are read dynamically.  To test, you can authenticate to the appropriate software and view the logs.

It is often wise to understand all the configuration files in question if you are attempting to make expansive configuration changes.
