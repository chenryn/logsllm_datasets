exist for these delays, and therefore, their model is in fact
accurate, because it plots what really happened.

in a between groups design, to avoid the learning effects of
paired designs, the only feasible solution was to use students
as subjects, as referred in subsection III-B1. We cannot claim
that these students are adequate surrogates for professional
software developers.
