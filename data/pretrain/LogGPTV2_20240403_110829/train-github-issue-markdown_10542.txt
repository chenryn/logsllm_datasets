**Describe the bug**
I was using r112 and everything was ok, after upgrading to r120 I noticed a
huge drop in fps when using composer render rather than the normal render.
there are 7 objects, 2000 instanced objects.
I know that 2000 sounds a big number, but it works well with normal rendering,
and it was working well too in composer renders in r112!
_**Live example**_
https://jsfiddle.net/xuqws0Lg/
you can switch between composer render and normal render in the animate
function to see the diff
**Expected behavior**
the expected behavior is that the composer renders in the same performance as
normal render do.
**Platform:**
  * Device: Desktop
  * OS: Linux
  * Browser: Chrome
  * Three.js version: r120
