### Survey Analysis on Group Communication and Trust Establishment

#### 4.3 In-Person Meetings and Group Communication

**Question:**
- **After meeting new people in a group situation, how often do you only contact one person versus contacting several people from the group?**
  - 1 = "100% of the time only contact an individual"
  - 3 = "50% of the time only contact an individual, 50% of the time contact multiple people"
  - 5 = "100% of the time contact multiple people"
  - Average (avg) = 2.44, Median = 3, n = 142

**Findings:**
- 85% of respondents selected an option other than 1, indicating that a significant portion of respondents communicate with multiple people from a group after the initial meeting.
- This result suggests that physical meetings are common, and thus, location-limited and comparison protocols are applicable.

**Follow-Up Questions:**
- **When you first met these people, how often did you already have a friend (not just an acquaintance) in common?**
  - 1 = never, 5 = always, avg = 3.33, n = 142
- **Do you often meet these people through a shared school, business, or other organization?**
  - 1 = never, 5 = always, avg = 3.37, n = 142

**Conclusion:**
- Respondents frequently meet people with whom they share affiliations or mutual friends, aligning with the use of public key, location-limited channel, and comparison-based group key protocols discussed in Section 2.

#### 4.4 Making New Acquaintances Online

**Introduction:**
- After understanding how respondents verify online identities after in-person meetings, we explored scenarios where respondents first met people online.

**Questions:**
- **If you did not first meet someone in person, how were you first introduced to them?**
  - Other person contacted you
  - You found the other person through a search or browsing pages
  - Introduced by a mutual friend
  - Met in an online community
  - Other

- **When you first communicated with one of these people online, how did you know you had found the right email address, screen name, or profile for the claimed person/people?**

**Findings:**
- Establishing trust online is challenging without a physical meeting. Figure 4 shows the categories and percentages of respondents' answers, with many marking multiple scenarios, leading to percentages exceeding 100%.
- A large portion of respondents receive unsolicited emails, making it difficult to infer the best group protocol for non-in-person groups. In other scenarios (searches, friends, and communities), web servers, mutual friends, or community managers can verify public keys.
- The "other" category was frequently used, but many respondents did not provide clarifying details.

**Open-Ended Question:**
- **How did you verify an online identity when someone initiated contact with you online?**

**Responses:**
- Partitioned into six categories:
  - Performing background research (54%)
  - Getting contact info directly from the person (43%)
  - Checking with a friend (14%)
  - Blindly trusting the person online (11%)
  - Verifying possession of private information (8%)
  - Not applicable (4%)

- These findings support the use of public key protocols leveraging common friends or businesses (59% of the time). However, 23% of respondents preferred a physical exchange, suggesting the need for location-limited or comparison-based group protocols.

#### 4.5 Verification of Online Identities

**Question:**
- **When you first communicated with one of these people online, how did you know you had found the right email address, screen name, or profile for the person/people you met?**

**Findings:**
- Responses were grouped into seven categories:
  - Never trusted the identity & limited information disclosure (28%)
  - Trusted an authority to verify the identity (28%)
  - Assumed the person was telling the truth (24%)
  - Trusted a mutual friend to verify the identity (15%)
  - Verified the identity using a shared secret (13%)
  - Verified the identity offline (8%)
  - Not applicable (6%)

- 38% of respondents used a trusted friend or authority, and 53% could benefit from public keys if cautious users are excluded. There is no clear solution for a large portion of respondents to verify online identities.

**Group Key Protocols:**
- No single secure solution works for the majority of respondents. Only 13% would use password-based protocols, and 8% would wait for a physical meeting.
- Public key-based protocols work for 38% of respondents who have trusted friends or authorities. Comparison-based protocols could be used with a trusted entity.
- A time-of-first-use authentication (similar to SSH) would allow those who blindly trust values (28%) to form groups, but this is vulnerable to active attackers.

#### 5. Guidelines for Future Group Protocols

**Key Findings:**
- Users will avoid adopting group key protocols unless their views on security tools change. Most (47%) rely on service providers for security, while only 15% use security software for one-on-one communications.
- Over 85% of respondents want to add members to the group, and 76% of long-term groups require deletion without reforming the group, indicating the need for dynamic group management.
- For in-person meetings, verification via third parties and physical collocation are acceptable for 59% and 43% of respondents, respectively.
- For online groups, there is no single overwhelming method for establishing trust.

**Table 1: How Various Group Key Protocols Fulfill Usersâ€™ Needs**
- Public key and location-limited channel protocols provide necessary group management functionality and align with a large portion of respondents' trust habits.
- For online groups, users' practices must adapt to accept public key-based protocols, or a new type of group key protocol is needed to allow member addition and deletion without public keys.

#### 6. Conclusions

- The survey indicates that users rarely secure one-on-one communication, and securing group communication is not a priority.
- If users focus on security, group key protocols match current group communication habits. Public key or location-limited channel protocols are most appropriate for in-person groups.
- For online groups, no single trust establishment mechanism is widely accepted, suggesting the need for new paradigms in future work.
