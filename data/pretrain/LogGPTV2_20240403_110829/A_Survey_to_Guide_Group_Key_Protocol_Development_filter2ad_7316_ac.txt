• After meeting new people in a group situation, how often
do you only contact one person versus contact several peo-
ple from the group situation? (1 = “100% of the time only
contact an individual”, 3 = “50% of the time only contact
an individual, 50% of the time contact multiple people”, 5
= “100% of the time contact multiple people”, avg = 2.44,
median = 3, n = 142)
85% of respondents checked some option other than 1 (im-
plying a large portion of respondents meet and later com-
municate with groups). This result shows that groups phys-
ically meet and thus location-limited and comparison pro-
tocols are applicable.
Following this were questions that asked users to rank how
often respondents met someone with shared afﬁliations and
friends of friends.
• When you ﬁrst met these people, how often did you already
have a friend (not just an acquaintance) in common? (1 =
never, 5 = always, avg = 3.33, n = 142)
• Do you often meet these people through a shared school,
business, or other organization? (1 = never, 5 = always, avg
= 3.37, n = 142)

which they communicate. Based on these facts, the public
key, location limited channel, and comparison based group
key protocols discussed in Section 2 coincide with users’
current habits and paradigms.
4.4 Making New Acquaintances Online
After learning how respondents veriﬁed an online identity
after meeting in person, we asked questions about scenar-
ios where respondents ﬁrst met people online (as opposed
to met in person). Without the ability to physically meet
people some other mechanism is needed to establish trust
between individuals or groups.
This section had the following questions:
• If you did not ﬁrst meet someone in person, how were you
ﬁrst introduced to them?
– other person contacted you
– you found the other person through a search or brows-
ing pages
– introduced by a mutual friend
– met in an online community
– Other
• When you ﬁrst communicated with one of these people on-
line, how did you know you had found the right email ad-
dress, screen name, or proﬁle for the claimed person/people?
This ﬁrst question is an important issue when it comes to es-
tablishing trust. If respondents met in a scenario with an ob-
vious authority, that authority becomes a trusted third party
for the veriﬁcation of public keys. However, if a respon-
dent simply gets an email from someone for what appears
to be no reason, a different mechanism is needed to verify
the individual’s claimed identity. Figure 4 shows the cate-
gories and percentage of respondents that responded to each
category. Respondents could mark any number of scenar-
ios and many did so percentages add to more than 100%.
Based on these responses, it is hard to infer what type of
group protocol would work best for groups that do not meet
in person. A large portion of respondents have received un-
solicited emails where there is no obvious source of trust. In
the three other scenarios (searches, friends, and communi-
ties), the web server, mutual friend, or community manager
could verify public keys. The “other” category was often
used, but many respondents failed to provide any answer to
clarify what the other mechanism was.
To help gain a better understanding of how respondents es-
tablished trust with online entities, we asked respondents
an open-ended question about how they veriﬁed an online
identity when someone initiated contact with them online.

Figure 3. How respondents conﬁrm they are
communicating with the correct online iden-
tiﬁer for a person they met
The results of these questions suggest that there is an above-
average portion of respondents who meet with people of-
ﬂine with who they already share either a common friend
or an organizational afﬁliation. This was further validated
in the next question, where we asked about validating the
contact’s online identity:
• When you ﬁrst communicated with one of these people on-
line, how did you know you had found the right email ad-
dress, screen name, or proﬁle for the person/people you met?
This was an open-ended question where we partitioned
the responses into six categories with the following dis-
tribution: performing background research such as a web
search or directory lookup to acquire information from a
trusted authority (54%), getting contact info directly from
the person either verbally or in the form of artifacts such
as a business card (43%), checking with a friend that the
email/screen name is correct (14%), blindly trusting the per-
son online (11%), making sure that the contact is in posses-
sion of information that the respondent, but not the general
public, are aware of (8%), and not applicable (i.e., “n/a”, “i
dunno”, “?”, ...) (4%). Similar to the previous open-ended
question, respondents could (and many of them did) give
multiple responses, which counted as multiple categories. A
comparison of these categories is shown in Figure 3. These
ﬁndings support the use of public key protocols where par-
ticipants could leverage common friends or businesses to
verify a public key (59% of the time). However, 23% of
respondents preferred a physical exchange and shared no
trusted authority or friend. In such a scenario, a group pro-
tocol that utilizes a location limited channel or comparison
is appropriate.
Responses in this section of the survey indicate that a large
number of respondents do meet in person and often do meet
with a group.
In addition, these respondents often share

Figure 4. How respondents met people online
Respondents provided answers that we could group into one
or more of seven possible categories (note percentages fail
to add to 100%).
• Never trusted the identity & limited information disclosure.
(28%)
• Trusted an authority to verify the identity (i.e., email address
matches name or Facebook details match claimed identity).
(28%)
• Assumed the person was telling the truth. (24%)
• Trusted a mutual friend to verify the identity. (15%)
• Veriﬁed the identity knew some private information – a
shared secret. (13%)
• Veriﬁed the identity ofﬂine using a phone call or a meeting
in person. (8%)
• Responses that were not applicable. (6%)
Figure ?? contains a summary of the results. 38% of respon-
dents utilized a trusted friend or a trusted authority to verify
an identity (scenarios where public keys are applicable). If
we were to discard the more cautious users which limited
disclosure, 53% of respondents could beneﬁt from public
keys (shared authority or ofﬂine veriﬁcation). As such there
is no clear solution that allows a large portion of the respon-
dents to verify an online identity. Unless online communi-
ties and social networks increase in popularity and begin to
act as certiﬁcate authorities (CAs), numerous mechanisms
are needed to accommodate the different methods that re-
spondents may utilize to establish trust when meeting on-
line.
When translated to group key protocols, no real secure so-
lution exists that would work for the majority of respon-
dents. Only a small percentage of respondents would utilize
password based protocols (13%). Location-limited chan-
nels that leverage physical collocation still are relevant since
Table 1. How Various Group Key Protocols
Fulﬁll Users’ Needs
8% of respondents waited for a physical meeting or an out-
of-band channel to verify an identity. Public key based pro-
tocols work with the 38% of respondents that shared friends
or trusted authorities that could act as certiﬁcate authorities
(CAs). Provided the trusted entity is online and coopera-
tive, these same respondents could leverage the trusted en-
tity as a secure channel to utilize comparison based proto-
cols. A time of ﬁrst use style of authentication (similar to
SSH) would allow those who blindly trust values (28%) to
form groups. However, such an approach is vulnerable to
active attackers that may modify or inject messages during
the group key protocol. Without a single protocol that ac-
commodates multiple methods to establish trust, multiple
situation-dependent group key protocols are needed to form
groups that meet online.
5 Guidelines for Future Group Protocols
Based on our ﬁndings, users will avoid adopting group
key protocols unless respondents’ views on security tools
change because most respondents (47%) rely on service
providers for security while only 15% of respondents used
security software for one-on-one communications. With
over 85% of respondents wanting to add members to the
group and 76% of long term groups requiring deletion with-
out reforming the group, it is clear group protocols must
support dynamic groups. For groups that meet in person,
veriﬁcation via third parties and physical collocation agree
with 59% and 43% of respondents respectively as an ac-
ceptable basis of trust. For groups that meet online, there is
no single overwhelming method for establishing trust.
Table 1 compares the general types of group key proto-
cols with respect to their management functionality and
applicability to survey respondents’ methods of establish-
ing trust. Users often want to add and remove members
from the group without having to reform the group(see Sec-
tion 4.2). As such, public key based [12, 18] and location
limited channel based [4, 16] protocols provide the neces-
sary group management functionality. These two types of
protocols agree with a large portion of respondents’ trust
habits when meeting groups in person (82% utilized either

channels to exchange public keys. With such an approach
a single group key protocol would fulﬁll users’ needs in-
dependent of how they acquired the public keys. When
meeting online there is no single protocol that satisﬁes a
large portion of respondents trust establishment habits. For
successful group key protocol adoption, respondents’ online
practices will have to adapt to accept public key based pro-
tocols (location-limited channels do not work online) or a
new type of group key protocol is needed to allow for mem-
ber addition and deletion without the use of public keys.
6 Conclusions
In this work, we performed an online survey to help un-
derstand how users communicate in groups and why users
continue to ignore group key protocols even though users
often communicate as groups. We also investigated how
users establish trust with individuals they meet both in per-
son and online. The results of the survey indicate that users
rarely secure one-on-one communication and thus secur-
ing group communication is not a goal. If users do begin
to focus on security, group key protocols match users cur-
rent group communication habits. For groups that meet in
person, public key or location limited channel based proto-
cols are the most appropriate. These protocols also allow
the addition and deletion of members without reforming
the group. However, as more communication moves on-
line, groups that only communicate online are relevant. For
online groups, respondents did not converge on a single ap-
propriate trust establishment mechanism for group key pro-
tocols. As such, one potential direction for future work is to
develop new online group key paradigms that are applicable
and accepted by the majority of users.
