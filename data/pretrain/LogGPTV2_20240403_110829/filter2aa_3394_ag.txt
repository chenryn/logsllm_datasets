APPENDIX B.    IMPACT OF ARCHITECTURE ON NETWORK
CAPACITY AND CALL DELAY
This appendix illustrates the impact of using conventional and trunked systems on
network capacity and call delay.  Traffic modeling shows that the computer-controlled access
capability of trunked systems provides less call delay and thus greater throughput as traffic load
in a typical system increases.
Exhibit 17 compares transmit delays for conventional and trunked channels as a function
of loading.
Two types of traffic models were used to perform an estimate of trunking load capacity,
one for each of the trunked system designs.  The Engset Model, which presumes that blocked
calls are lost with finite sources, was used for calculating theoretical load capacity of a trunked
system with decentralized control.  The Delay Model, a finite source model, which presumes that
blocked calls are delayed, was used for calculating theoretical load capacity of a trunked system
with centralized control.  Note that these are just theoretical models that do not take into account
many capacity-limiting factors of real system implementations, such as specific system
configuration, signal strength, etc.
Exhibit 18 compares conventional and trunked capacity11 for up to 20 channels using
each model, where P is probability of a successful call by an average user.  Because the scale of
this exhibit makes it difficult to see differences when only a few channels are involved,
Exhibit 19 offers a comparison of capacity estimates for systems with up to five channels.

APPENDIX C.    COSTING ASSUMPTIONS AND MATHEMATICAL
CAPACITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRUNKED SYSTEMS
C.1
Assumptions
1. All systems have coverage over same geographic area
2. Coverage of VHF, UHF and 800 MHz systems is assumed to be provided by a respective
number-of-sites ratio of 1:2:4.
3. All systems use the same amount of spectrum.  Consequently, if the legacy conventional
analog FM broadband system with a number of channels N has a total spectrum at N*25 kHz,
a newer system with a channel bandwidth X has a number of channels calculated as
N1=N*25 kHz/X
4. Average per user load on the system is 0.0073 Erlangs as was estimated in [1].
5. The additional cost of phase-locking equipment for simulcast systems was not considered
6. New facilities (site facilities, dispatch centers, etc.) are not taken into account
C.2
Traffic Models Used
1. For conventional capacity – Engset Model results for one channel are multiplied by the
number of channels.
2. For decentralized trunked with no queueing – Engset Model is used for finite sources.
3. For centralized trunked systems (with queueing) – Delay Model is used for channels (N1-1),
allowing for one control channel.
4. Results of the calculations by these models are below:
