## Appendix B: Impact of Architecture on Network Capacity and Call Delay

This appendix examines the impact of using conventional and trunked systems on network capacity and call delay. Traffic modeling indicates that the computer-controlled access capability of trunked systems results in lower call delays and, consequently, higher throughput as traffic load increases.

### Exhibit 17: Transmit Delays for Conventional and Trunked Channels

Exhibit 17 compares the transmit delays for conventional and trunked channels as a function of loading. The calculations are based on an average user message duration of 6 seconds.

### Comparison of Conventional and Trunked Systems

Two types of traffic models were used to estimate the trunking load capacity, one for each type of trunked system design:
- **Engset Model**: Assumes that blocked calls are lost with finite sources. This model was used to calculate the theoretical load capacity of a trunked system with decentralized control.
- **Delay Model**: A finite source model that assumes blocked calls are delayed. This model was used to calculate the theoretical load capacity of a trunked system with centralized control.

Note that these are theoretical models and do not account for many real-world capacity-limiting factors, such as specific system configurations and signal strength.

### Exhibit 18: Conventional and Trunked Capacity for Up to 20 Channels

Exhibit 18 compares the capacity of conventional and trunked systems for up to 20 channels, where \( P \) is the probability of a successful call by an average user. The exhibit includes data for various probabilities and channel counts.

### Exhibit 19: Conventional and Trunked Capacity for Up to Five Channels

Exhibit 19 provides a more detailed comparison of capacity estimates for systems with up to five channels, as the scale in Exhibit 18 makes it difficult to see differences when only a few channels are involved.

## Appendix C: Costing Assumptions and Mathematical Capacity Considerations for Trunked Systems

### C.1 Assumptions

1. All systems cover the same geographic area.
2. Coverage of VHF, UHF, and 800 MHz systems is provided by a respective number-of-sites ratio of 1:2:4.
3. All systems use the same amount of spectrum. If a legacy conventional analog FM broadband system with \( N \) channels has a total spectrum of \( N \times 25 \) kHz, a newer system with a channel bandwidth \( X \) will have a number of channels calculated as \( N_1 = \frac{N \times 25 \text{ kHz}}{X} \).
4. The average per-user load on the system is 0.0073 Erlangs, as estimated in [1].
5. The additional cost of phase-locking equipment for simulcast systems is not considered.
6. New facilities (site facilities, dispatch centers, etc.) are not taken into account.

### C.2 Traffic Models Used

1. **Conventional Capacity**: Engset Model results for one channel are multiplied by the number of channels.
2. **Decentralized Trunked with No Queueing**: Engset Model is used for finite sources.
3. **Centralized Trunked Systems (with Queueing)**: Delay Model is used for \( N_1 - 1 \) channels, allowing for one control channel.

### Results of the Calculations

| Model                    | Channels | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 9   | 10  | 19  | 20  |
|--------------------------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Delay Model (N1-1)**   |          | -   | 70  | 163 | 264 | 369 | 479 | 936 | N/A | N/A |
| **Engset Model**         |          | 47  | 169 | 314 | 470 | 632 | 1,312 | 1,486 | 3,085 | 3,265 |
| **Conventional**         |          | 47  | 94  | 141 | 188 | 235 | 423 | 470 | 893 | 940 |
