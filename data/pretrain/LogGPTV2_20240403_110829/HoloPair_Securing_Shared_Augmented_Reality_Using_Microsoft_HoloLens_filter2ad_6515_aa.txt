ABSTRACT
Augmented Reality (AR) devices continuously scan their environ-
ment in order to naturally overlay virtual objects onto user’s view
of the physical world. In contrast to Virtual Reality, where one’s
environment is fully replaced with a virtual one, one of AR’s "killer
features" is co-located collaboration, in which multiple users inter-
act with the same combination of virtual and real objects. Microsoft
recently released HoloLens, the first consumer-ready augmented
reality headset that needs no outside markers to achieve precise
inside-out spatial mapping, which allows centimeter-scale holo-
gram positioning.
However, despite many applications published on the Windows
Mixed Reality platform that rely on direct communication between
AR devices, there currently exists no implementation or achievable
proposal for secure direct pairing of two unassociated headsets.
As augmented reality gets into mainstream, this omission exposes
current and future users to a range of avoidable attacks. In order to
close this real-world gap in both theory and engineering practice,
in this paper we design and evaluate HoloPair, a system for secure
and usable pairing of two AR headsets.
We propose a pairing protocol and build a working prototype
to experimentally evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and
system performance. By running a user study with a total of 22
participants, we show that the system achieves high rates of at-
tack detection, short pairing times, and a high average usability
score. Moreover, in order to make an immediate impact on the
wider developer community, we have published the full implemen-
tation and source code of our prototype, which is currently under
consideration to be included in the official HoloLens development
toolkit.

Figure 1: A real-world view of a shared augmented reality ex-
perience of two of our study participants. In this paper, we
focus on the challenge of securely and usably pairing aug-
mented reality headsets in order to support a multitude of
collaborative AR use cases and applications.
virtual reality, in which user’s environment is completely replaced
with a virtual one, AR enabled devices (such as headsets, mobile-
phones, car windshields, etc.) continuously monitor and sense their
surrounding in order to create an experience in which the virtual
content is naturally blended with the real world.
Many of the largest tech companies are placing AR into focus of
their near- and mid-term plans. Recent examples include Facebook
making AR the central topic of their 2017 F8 developer conference,
Apple developing their own AR spectacles and recruiting top ex-
perts from the field [23], and Google investing more than $540
million into an AR startup Magic Leap [7], while also working on
Tango [11], their own AR computing platform.
Windows Mixed Reality platform. Microsoft recently released
HoloLens, a self-contained (fully untethered) head mounted com-
puter, the first publicly available headset that supports the wider
Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) platform, which has already been
integrated into the core Windows 10 functionality1.
HoloLens’s main innovation is its remarkably precise inside-out
position tracking that does not rely on any outside sensors or mark-
ers. This, in turn, enables developers to render realistic 3D virtual
objects (holograms) that are precisely anchored in the environment
and interact with existing physical objects (as shown in Figure 1).
Consequently, Microsoft brands HoloLens as a "Mixed Reality"
1Recent announcement from the company stated that, by the end of 2017, "an update
to Windows 10 will enable mainstream PCs to run the Windows Holographic shell and
associated mixed reality and universal Windows applications." [10]
device, emphasizing the anchoring capabilities over the simpler,
HUD-style overlays, that most existing AR devices support. 2. While
HoloLens is currently the only commercial device with such capabil-
ities, this is rapidly changing, as manufacturers such as Acer, ASUS,
Dell, HP, and Lenovo [27] all recently announced their headsets for
the WMR platform.
Shared Augmented Reality. Besides individual use, HoloLens
headsets open a wide range of possibilities for collaboration of
co-located users, in which they all experience precisely the same
virtual objects embedded in their shared environment. One such
example is NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s who already "allow
their scientists to work on Mars" by using HoloLens devices to train,
plan, and execute their Mars rover missions [17]. Other examples
include doctors using HoloLens during brain and spinal chord brain
surgeries [20], or Israel and US defense forces using the device for
training and mission planning [1, 4].
At the core of many of these security- and privacy-critical ap-
plications is the ability to directly connect multiple headsets in
order to show the same, precisely located holograms to multiple
users. However, when two previously unassociated devices estab-
lish a connection for the first time, it is crucial to prevent potential
man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by relying on an independent
out-of-band channel [15].
Unfortunately, the only published research on the topic of se-
cure pairing of AR headsets heavily relies on wireless localization
capabilities, which are currently not available in any consumer-
facing AR device [9]. Consequently, despite the large number of
published AR applications, the quickly growing WMR Platform
currently lacks any implementation or practical research proposal
to securely perform direct pairing of two or more AR headsets.
The Challenge. Despite the extensive previous research on secure
device pairing, which we overview in Section 9, existing protocols
are not directly applicable to AR headsets since they fail to address
two specific challenges. Firstly, instead of assuming a single user
who controls two devices, AR pairing necessarily involves two users,
each with their own headset. Since AR headsets are designed to
be continuously worn throughout the course of a normal workday,
users must not be required to take them off, and can, consequently,
only observe the output from their own device. Secondly, consider-
ing the proliferation of AR devices, each of which include multiple
front-facing cameras, it is necessary to assume that the adversary
can fully eavesdrop the out-of-band communication. This is not a
typical adversary model considered in device pairing, where the
adversary usually only controls the wireless network.
Contributions. We address this challenge by relying on the unob-
servability of AR displays and by exploiting HoloLens’ state-of-the-
art inside-out positioning. This allows us to design protocols that
are based on precisely positioned shared holograms to augment
users’ communication channels, while at the same time retaining
the usability of the system.
In this paper, we design HoloPair, a practical and usable system
that achieves secure pairing of two augmented reality headsets.
2The debate about the appropriate use of the terms "augmented reality" and "mixed
reality" is still ongoing. In this paper, we use the terms interchangeably.
In order to evaluate its security guarantees, usability, and perfor-
mance, we implement a working prototype of the system using two
Microsoft HoloLens devices, and run a comprehensive user study
with 22 participants. As the measurements show, the majority of
participants are able to successfully detect simulated attacks or
confirm that pairing was successful in as little as 8 seconds. Despite
participants’ lack of earlier experience with AR headsets, the results
of the post-experiment questionnaire show high subjective opinion
of the usability of the HoloPair system.
Finally, as the number of devices that support the WMR platform
grows, the developer community will likely continue publishing
new applications that rely on shared augmented reality experiences
with increasing speed. In order to ensure that security concerns are
considered from early stages of the growth of the developer com-
munity, we’ve made the full implementation available to the public
and started the process to include the source code in Microsoft’s
official HoloLens-Unity repository.
2 WHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT HOLOLENS?
Spatial mapping and Inside-out tracking. The main innovation
of Microsoft HoloLens over previously available augmented reality
headsets is considered to be precise inside-out position tracking
and spatial mapping of the surrounding environment. The inputs
from two "environment understanding cameras" on each side, a
depth camera, an ambient light sensor, and a 2MP video camera are
combined in the custom made Holographic Processing Unit (HPU)
to build and maintain a model of the surrounding objects, which
are then used as anchors for precise head and object tracking.
This allows developers to create immersive mixed reality experi-
ences in which the position of virtual objects (holograms) is fixed
in space with centimeter scale precision, and they naturally react to
collisions with the physical world or remain at their location over
multiple sessions or even months.
Sharing holograms: World Anchor. Shared holographic experi-
ences, in which the same holograms are shown on multiple devices
in a specific physical space is at the core of many augmented cur-
rent and future reality experiences, which range from 3D modeling,
augmenting or collaborating during manufacturing, surgical, or
mechanical procedures, to gaming or even military training.
Microsoft’s current development toolkit (HoloToolkit-Unity [12])
provides support for such shared experiences in a form of world
anchors. One of the devices establishes an anchor at a specific
location and communicates its position within its model of the
room to all other devices. The anchor is then used as a reference
point for the coordinate system, in which the shared holographic
objects are located at the same position to each user.
Gesture Tracking. Using its multiple depth perception cameras,
HoloLens is able to precisely track users’ hands and recognize hand
gestures such as pointing & clicking, zooming, or bloom (used as
a generic "back/menu" command). Due to the lack of keyboard
or mouse input, the gesture recognition module is the main con-
trol channel, used in different application to naturally manipulate,
control, and even model or draw 3D objects in space.
3.2 Adversary Model
We assume a Dolev-Yao style network adversary E, whose goal
is to use his device(s) to prevent UA and UB from establishing
a secure connection, for instance by positioning himself as the
man-in-the-middle.
In contrast to most previous work on device pairing, we consider
the adversary to be co-located and able to position himself arbi-
trarily close to one or both protocol participants. While this gives
him the ability to fully eavesdrop on the visual channel, he must,
however, remain passive, since any intrusion would be detected
as suspicious behavior by the legitimate protocol participants. For
instance, if the protocol requires UB to make a gesture, E is unable
to prevent this from happening ("jamming" it) since that would be
detected by UA, and would cause the protocol to abort.
However, he can not observe the independently generated holo-
grams that each device overlays over their user’s view of the physi-
cal world. We do not consider denial-of-service attacks.
3.3 Design Goals
Based on the discussion in the previous sections, we state the de-
sign goals for a successful system for pairing of augmented reality
devices as:
• Security. The attacker must have a low chance of a success-
ful man-in-the-middle attack. Users should detect attempts
of a man-in-the-middle attack in the majority of cases.
• Usability. The system must not require users to take their
headsets off. The interaction should be relatively short and
users should be willing to perform it whenever they wish to
share an AR experience with a new user/device. Most pairing
attempts should result in a successful key confirmation.
• Hardware Requirements. The system should not require
capabilities that are not available on current devices (specif-
ically MS HoloLens). In order to allow seamless execution
whenever two AR users decide to share their augmented
realities, the proposed pairing system should neither have
high computational, memory, nor energy requirements.
4 THE HOLOPAIR SYSTEM
We now present HoloPair, a system that achieves usable and secure
authenticated key exchange of two augmented reality headsets
without relying on any third party.
4.1 System Overview
Our system builds upon the general idea of establishing a secure
communication channel using Short Authenticated Strings [25],
which we simplify and adapt to the specific usability considerations
of AR headsets: having two users that should not be required to not
take their devices off their heads, an an adversary who can observe
all their actions.
The devices first exchange their public keys over the high-bandwidth,
but insecure channel, then commit and agree on a specific instance
of a weak-hash. Finally, the human participants confirm the au-
thenticity of the exchanged keys using the low-bandwidth visual
channel whose integrity is guaranteed.
Figure 2: System model. Two individuals, each equipped
with an AR headset, wish to establish a secure channel for
subsequent communication. Devices communicate over the
high-bandwidth wireless channel, which is controlled by the
adversary. Users communicate over low-bandwidth visual
channel, which can be eavesdropped, but not intruded by the
adversary, since that would be detected by legitimate proto-
col participants. Each headset can independently and unob-
servably overlay arbitrary content over their user’s view of
the physical world.
3 ASSUMPTIONS AND GOALS
We assume a scenario in which two users, UA and UB, that do not
have a pre-shared secret and are both wearing an augmented reality
headset (such as Microsoft HoloLens), meet at in person and want
to securely connect their devices to share an AR experience.
3.1 System Model
As shown in Figure 2, UA and UB are each equipped with a trusted
device, DA and DB, which can augment their view of the physical
world by independently drawing precisely positioned holograms.
We assume that the AR headsets can communicate over a high-
bandwidth wireless channel and have no other direct channel of
communication. Users, however, can communicate over an out-of-
band audio or visual channel on which their headsets can inde-
pendently and unobservably overlay content. Consequently, a way
to view the system model from the perspective of the headsets is to
imagine that they are using human participants as output channels
for their communication over the out-of-band channels.
In our system model, we aim to not rely on the audio channel, as
it is inherently undirected, polluted by each additional participant,
and easily injected into. On the other hand, the visual channel
does not depend on the environment noise, can be used in many
scenarios where silence is expected (e.g. during lectures or meetings,
in public spaces), and is significantly harder to undetectably inject
into [6].
We assume that users do not have access to any other trusted
third-party service that they could use to establish the connection,
such as PKI infrastructure. Finally, since human participants are
