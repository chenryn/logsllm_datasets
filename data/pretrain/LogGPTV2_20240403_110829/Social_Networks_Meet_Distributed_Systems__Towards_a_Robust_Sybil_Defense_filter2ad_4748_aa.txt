### Abstract
This paper investigates the impact of high churn rates on the robustness of decentralized social network-based Sybil defense (SNSD) schemes. Our analysis reveals two key findings: (i) high churn rates can fragment the social overlay network, which is crucial for these schemes, into multiple disconnected components, leading to poor network connectivity; and (ii) a naive solution that adds links from each node to all its 2-hop neighbors improves network connectivity but significantly reduces the attack resilience of these schemes.

We propose a new design approach that balances network connectivity and attack resilience in SNSD schemes. In this approach, each node selectively adds links to only a few of its 2-hop neighbors based on a minimum expansion contribution (MinEC) heuristic. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves similar network connectivity to the naive 2-hop solution while maintaining strong attack resilience. Additionally, our approach preserves the fast-mixing property, which is essential for many SNSD schemes, even at high churn levels. This suggests that existing and future SNSD schemes can easily incorporate our approach with minimal modifications.

### 1. Introduction
Security and churn are two major challenges in the design of open distributed systems. One of the most significant security threats these systems face is the Sybil attack, where an adversary creates multiple fake identities to undermine the system's utility for honest users. Decentralized social network-based Sybil defense (SNSD) schemes have been proposed to address this issue by leveraging the trust relationships among users. These schemes typically rely on a social overlay network to detect and mitigate Sybil attacks.

However, high churn rates, characterized by frequent node arrivals and departures, can severely degrade the performance of SNSD schemes. This paper explores the impact of churn on SNSD schemes and proposes a novel approach to enhance their robustness under such conditions.

Such an attack has been addressed by the decentralized social network-based Sybil defense (SNSD) schemes [32, 31, 18, 21, 27] that leverage the trust relationships among users and the social overlay network to detect and mitigate Sybil identities.
