ABSTRACT
This paper examines the impact of heavy churn on the ro-
bustness of decentralized social network-based Sybil defense
(SNSD) schemes. Our analysis reveals that (i) heavy churn
disintegrates the social overlay network that is fundamental
to these schemes into multiple disconnected components, re-
sulting in poor network connectivity, and (ii) a naive solution
that adds links from each node to all its 2-hop neighbors im-
proves network connectivity but comes at a signiﬁcant cost
of poor attack resilience of these schemes.
We propose a new design point in the trade-oﬀ between
network connectivity and attack resilience of SNSD schemes,
where each node adds links to only a selective few of all its 2-
hop neighbors based on a minimum expansion contribution
(MinEC) heuristic. Extensive evaluation through simula-
tions shows that our approach fares as good as the naive
2-hop solution in terms of network connectivity, while mak-
ing little compromise on the attack resilience. Moreover, our
approach preserves the fast-mixing property that is funda-
mental to many SNSD schemes even at high levels of churn.
This result suggests that existing and potential future SNSD
schemes relying on this property can incorporate our ap-
proach into their designs with minimal changes.

INTRODUCTION
Security and churn are two key challenges in designing
open distributed systems. One of the most demanding secu-
rity challenges these systems face is a Sybil attack [14], where
an adversary creates an arbitrary number of Sybil identities
in order to reduce the system utility for the honest users.
