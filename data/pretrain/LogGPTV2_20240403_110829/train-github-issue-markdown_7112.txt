Running neo4j-admin gets stuck deterministically. We can see using strace
there's no system call running doing IO. All threads are stuck on Mutexes.  
I suspect a potential dead lock or a thread dying.
**Neo4j Version:** 4.1.2 (also reproduced on previous two versions)
### Steps to reproduce
neo4j-admin import  
\--database=$DBNAME  
\--delimiter="|"  
\--nodes=REDACTED=${NODE_DIR}/REDACTED.csv,${DATA_DIR}/REDACTED.csv \ # 44
more lines like this  
\--relationships=REDACTED=${EDGE_DIR}/REDACTED.csv,${DATA_DIR}/REDACTED.csv \
# 75 more lines like this  
\--skip-bad-relationships=REDACTED  
\--skip-duplicate-nodes=REDACTED  
\--trim-strings=true

The backing store is NFS which we know is not recommended by the documentation
but we disabled locking by NFS so the kernel manages them locally as if the
application was running locally.
