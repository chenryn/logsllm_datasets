When trying out the standard lineplot example on my machine, the code stops
with an error in algorithm.py line 85:
`TypeError: Cannot cast array data from dtype('int64') to dtype('int32')
according to the rule 'safe'`
line 85 is: `sample = [a.take(resampler, axis=0) for a in args]`
where `resampler` comes from the previous line `resampler = integers(0, n, n)`
and `integers` is `np.random.default_rng().integers` which default returns an
array of int64.
Probably a recent change to `np.take` now checks the type of its first
parameter (`indices`).  
An obvious solution seems to be changing line 84 to `resampler = integers(0,
n, n, dtype=np.int32)`.
numpy version 1.18.1  
seaborn version 0.10.0
Just running the default example caused the crash:
    import seaborn as sns
    import numpy as np
    fmri = sns.load_dataset("fmri")
    ax = sns.lineplot(x="timepoint", y="signal", data=fmri)
