## Purpose
This study aims to examine the security of wireless hotspots from two perspectives:
1. **Providers**
2. **End Users**

We will explore a variety of implementations, including:
- Cafés
- Hotels

### Tools
- Laptops, Dell Axim
- Hermes and Prism chipsets
- Various software tools
- Tolerant bladder (for extended testing sessions)

## WISPs (Wireless Internet Service Providers)
Also known as "Hotspots," these are wireless internet access points located in various public places, such as:
- Airports
- Hotels
- Retail stores
- Coffee shops

### Why Go Wireless?
- **Cost**: Lower costs compared to traditional wired connections.
- **Convenience**: Easy and flexible access to the internet.

## Industry Overview
### Startups
- Boingo
- WayPort
- NetNearU
- HotSpotzz
- Airpath Wireless
- Surf and Sip
- HereUAre
- Deep Blue Wireless
- Joltage (defunct)

### Telecommunications
- T-Mobile
- AT&T (Cometa)
- Sprint (Boingo)

### Hardware
- Intel (Cometa)
- IBM (Cometa)

## Provider Risks
### Business Risks
- **Financial Loss**: Potential revenue loss due to unauthorized usage.
- **Launch Pad for Anonymous Attacks**: Hotspots can be used to launch attacks while maintaining anonymity.

### Network Level Attacks
- **Privacy**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Confidentiality**: Data breaches.
- **Data Integrity**: Tampering with data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**: Disruption of service availability.

## End User Risks
### Node vs. Network Level Security
- **"Crunchy on the outside, Chewy on the inside"**: Strong perimeter security but weak internal security.

### Untrusted Networks
- **Intranet Safe Services**: Ensuring secure access to internal networks.
- **Information Leakage**: Unintentional disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Spoof Attacks**: Impersonation of legitimate users or devices.

### End User Awareness
- Educating users about the risks and best practices for using wireless hotspots.

## Security Implementations
### Access Control
- **Firewall**: Restricts connectivity to only authorized users.
- **Web Requests Redirected to Login Screen**: Ensures users authenticate before accessing the internet.
- **SSL Authentication**: Secure login process.
- **Internet Access Granted**: Once authenticated, users gain access to the internet.

### IP Address Filtering
- **Everyone**: All users are subject to filtering.
- **MAC Address Filtering**: Specific to T-Mobile.
- **IPSec VPN**: Optional, provided by Deep Blue Wireless.
- **DHCP Lease Expiration**: Ensures temporary access, preventing long-term unauthorized use.

## Revenue Loss
### Tunneling Data Through Unfiltered Protocols
- **Bypassing Access Controls**: Unauthorized users can tunnel data through unfiltered protocols.

### Connection Hijacking
- **Stealing Legitimate Connections**: Unauthorized users can hijack existing connections.

### Connection Sharing
- **Multiple Unauthorized Connections**: Multiple unauthorized users can share a single legitimate connection.

## Network Level Attacks
### Traffic Monitoring
- **Passive Attack**: Eavesdropping on network traffic.

### DNS Hijacking
- **Active Attack**: Redirecting users to malicious sites.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
- **Intercepting and Modifying Data**: Intercepting and altering data between the user and the server.

### Auto Update Hijacking
- **Malicious Updates**: Intercepting and modifying software updates.

### Public IP Addresses
- **WayPort**: Vulnerable to remote attacks due to public IP addresses.

### ARP Spoofing
- **Active Attack**: Impersonating legitimate users or devices.

### Network Crossover
- **Cross-Connection**: Unauthorized access to other networks.

## Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
### Physical Layer (Layer 1)
- **Interference**: Jamming signals to disrupt service.

### Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- **ARP Spoofing**: Flooding the network with false ARP requests.

### Network Layer (Layer 3)
- **AirJack**: Tools like AirJack can be used to perform DoS attacks.

## End User Countermeasures
- **VPN**: Use a Virtual Private Network for secure connections.
- **Encryption with Validation**: Ensure data is encrypted and validated.
- **Operating System (O/S) Hardening**: Secure the operating system.
- **Node-Level Firewall/IDS**: Use firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems.
- **Dedicated Travel Hardware**: Use dedicated devices for travel to minimize risk.

## Improved WISP Security
- **Non-Internet Addressable IPs**: Use Network Address Translation (NAT) to hide internal IP addresses.
- **Filter All Protocols**: Block all unnecessary protocols.
- **802.1x**: Use 802.1x for strong authentication.
- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: Detect and alert on suspicious activities.
- **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**: Prevent and block malicious activities.
