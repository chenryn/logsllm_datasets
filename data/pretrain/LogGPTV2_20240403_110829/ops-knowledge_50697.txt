User: Just installed Python 2.7.3 on a Windows7 machine. 
How do I get .py files to be associated with python (they are with notepad ATM) and how do I get the context menu shortcut for "edit in IDLE"? Somehow I didn't get that on this particular computer.
Assistant: try making a .py file and then try to open it, and a window should appear asking you what to open it with, and then select idle in your program files.
