### Title: One Glitch to Rule Them All: Fault Injection Attacks Against the AMD Secure Processor

**Abstract:**

Modern AMD CPUs incorporate a dedicated security coprocessor, the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP), previously known as the Platform Security Processor (PSP). This coprocessor serves as the root of trust for all contemporary AMD systems and acts as a trust anchor for various security features, including AMD's Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology and the firmware Trusted Platform Module (fTPM). The AMD-SP is an ARM-based coprocessor integrated into AMD CPUs, with privileges that surpass even those of the lowest ring on the x86 cores.

In this presentation, we will introduce a new hardware attack against the AMD-SP, which enables us to execute arbitrary code on the AMD-SPs of Ryzen and Epyc CPUs across all Zen microarchitectures (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). By manipulating the input voltage to the AMD SoC, we can bypass the firmware verification mechanism of the AMD-SP, allowing us to deploy custom payloads directly after the SP's ROM bootloader. Unlike previous attacks, our method does not rely on the presence of firmware vulnerabilities. To our knowledge, all AMD CPUs based on Zen microarchitectures are susceptible to this attack.

The hardware setup required to perform this glitching attack is both inexpensive and easily adaptable to new targets. We will demonstrate how an adversary with physical access to the target host can implant a custom SEV firmware that decrypts SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs). Additionally, we will show how to extract endorsement keys from SEV-enabled CPUs. These extracted keys can be used by an attacker to forge attestation reports or masquerade as a valid target for VM migration, without requiring physical access to the target host.

We have also reverse-engineered the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism, introduced with SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware version of TCB components relevant for SEV. We will present a method to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware versions using secrets extracted from the AMD-SP.

This research highlights significant security implications for systems relying on the AMD-SP and underscores the need for robust defenses against fault injection attacks.
