ABSTRACT
The next generation of automobiles
(also known as
CyberVehicles) will
electronic
control units in novel automotive control applications.
Recent work has demonstrated vulnerability of modern
automotive control systems to security attacks that directly
impact CyberVehicles’ physical safety and dependability.
The First International Academic Workshop on Security,
Privacy and Dependability for CyberVehicles (CyCAR’13)
focuses on security and privacy topics in CyberVehicles that
are within the scope of ACM Conference on Computer and
Communications Security (CCS). Speciﬁcally, the workshop
targets issues related to security and privacy issues in
computerized, complex, and connected modern vehicles as
well as their complex supply chains. This workshop oﬀers
an opportunity to trigger the transfer of the accumulated
knowledge by the ACM CCS community to the car industry
while taking into account typical automotive constraints
such as interoperability, reliability, dependability, quality,
resource constraints and/or complex supply chain.

INTRODUCTION
Modern automotive systems integrate a multitude of
embedded hard real-time control functionalities, and a host
of advanced information and entertainment (infotainment)
features. The true paradigm shift for future automotive
(CyberVehicle) systems and other transportation systems,
i.e., avionics, maritime, and rails,
is not only a result
of this increasing plurality of subsystems and functions,
but
is also driven by the unprecedented levels of
intra- and inter-CyberVehicle system connections and
communications as well as networking with external entities,
such as
The
emergence of new generations of intelligent transportation
systems that are fully connected to their surrounding
objects, environments, and networks poses various design
challenges for the automotive/transportation industry, such
as interoperability, reliability, dependability, quality and
security.
smart mobile devices and the cloud.
The development of CyberVehicles is both necessary and
inevitable, as it opens up both several business opportunities
and user comfort. For example, traﬃc congestion avoidance
mitigation services that take advantage of connectivity to
the cloud and global perspective of route conditions can
alleviate the rising business losses due to traﬃc jam in
metropolitan areas. Such services ought to consider safety
and security as a top objectives as attacks to one subsystem
or network component could impact a larger portion of the
connected system.
The First International Academic Workshop on Security,
Privacy and Dependability for CyberVehicles (CyCAR’13)
brings together researchers and practitioners in security
domain related to modern and next generation automotive
systems. The workshop solicited two types of original
papers:
full papers and short/work-in-progress/position-
papers. The goal of this workshop is to bring together
academic and automotive industry researchers to discuss,
identify and address the challenges related to achieving
secure, dependable and privacy-preserving cybervehicle
systems.

CyCAR’2013 will be a full-day workshop program on
the ﬁrst day of CCS 2013. The workshop will begin with
an invited talk from Ulrich Huber, Associate principal of
McKinsey & Company, responsible for automotive solutions.
In his talk ”Mobility of the future”, Ulrich will present his
views on the roadmap of future applications in the area of
cyber vehicles and their impact on security and privacy. The
workshop will also have accepted paper sessions. Each paper
session will conclude with a discussion led by a pre-chosen
workshop participant. These discussions will tie together
common themes of the presentations and hopefully lead to
insightful discussions about future research directions. The
program will end with a panel discussion where panelists
will discuss the current state of the art, focus areas, and
opportunities for future research.
