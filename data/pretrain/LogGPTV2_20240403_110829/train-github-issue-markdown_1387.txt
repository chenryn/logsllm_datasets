  * I tried using the `@types/react` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
I think you should consider to update these lines of code in order to support
react 16 fragments
    render(): JSX.Element | null | false | string | JSX.Element[]; //class Component
    interface ElementClass extends React.Component {
        render(): Element | null | false | string | Element[];
    }
