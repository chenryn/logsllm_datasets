User: We're using nose with nose-gae for unit testing our controllers and models. We now have code that hits the blob store and files API. We are having a hard time testing those due to lack of testing proxies/mocks. Is there a good way to unit tests these services or lacking unit testing is there a way to automated acceptance test those APIs? TIA.
Assistant: I had the same question so I dug into the nosegae code, and then into the actual testbed code.
All you need to do is set nosegae_blobstore = True where you're setting up all the other stubs. This sets up a dict-backed blobstore stub.
