    request.meta['handle_httpstatus_all'] = True
    dfd = self.crawler.engine.download(request, info.spider)
When Media Pipeline schedules request it attached `handle_httpstatus_all` meta
which prevents Redirect Middleware from doing it's job. This breaks download
of images that require redirect, mostly urls that need to redirect from `http`
to `https`.
Maybe implement a setting to enable redirects in this pipeline?
