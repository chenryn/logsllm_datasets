ple. We analyzed our data in ascending order of publication
date to see if speciﬁc trends emerged over time. As suggested
by [14], we employed coding techniques as follows:
Open coding: We read papers and highlighted those parts of
each paper that appeared relevant to our research questions. We
then assigned one or more codes to each highlighted text frag-
ment. One of the coauthors performed open coding for each of
the papers in the dataset, and another coded 150 papers of the
dataset that were published most recently. Two researchers met
frequently online to discuss their interpretations of the codes
and resolve any disagreements. As a result, a total of 148
individual codes were generated.

Axial coding: Each of the two coauthors independently
grouped codes identiﬁed during open coding into a set of
categories. Then they met online to discuss the differences and
converge on a single set of categories. Instead of quantitatively
measuring the agreement between the two researchers, we
focused on using the differences to discuss the best way to
interpret the codes [29]. As a result, the researchers arrived at
a set of 19 categories.
Selective coding: All coauthors discussed labels and seman-
tics for all of the categories and arrived at a consensus. We re-
solved our differences by inquiring about the reason(s) behind
the category label(s) and discussing the idea(s) that surrounded
the labeling of the category, while trying to reach a consensus
that all coauthors agreed with. Afterward, we performed a
card sorting exercise to determine the relationships between
the categories. We also had several brainstorming exercises
to better organize our ﬁndings. As part of those exercises,
we selected main categories and subcategories. We reached
saturation in this process when no new revisions emerged.
E. Present
All coauthors organized the key insights that we derived
from the categories and the relationship(s) between them. We
present our ﬁndings in the following sections.
IV. RESULTS: HOW TECHNOLOGY FACILITATES ABUSE
While digital technology alone cannot cause sexual assault,
characteristics of its design can make harmful behaviors
easier to perform. In this section, we present 10 such char-
acteristics that emerged from our analysis of the literature:
covertness, publicness, anonymity, evolution, boundlessness,
reproducibility, accessibility, indispensability, malleability, and
opaqueness. While performing the analysis, we also identiﬁed,
whenever possible, the capabilities of the perpetrators that
these characteristics enable or at least amplify. Our ﬁndings
are visually summarized in Figure 1.
It is important to note that we did not differentiate the type
of perpetrator for two reasons. First, it was often conﬂated in
the literature. Second, we are presenting our results according
to technological characteristics and not by the type of abuse or
perpetrator. As such, to avoid confusion and added complexity
we did not make the distinction.
A. Covertness
We deﬁned covertness as the ability to operate technol-
ogy in a particular location without the knowledge of the
impacted individuals. This trait allows perpetrators to subtly
gather information about or monitor their targets and victims.
This is mostly seen in mobile or Internet of Things (IoT)
devices [30], and spyware [31], [32]. Abusers can also hack
into non-IoT devices, victims’ emails, and social networking
and media accounts (e.g., dating sites) to covertly use or gather
information [33], [34].
Perpetrators use technological tools that enable the surveil-
lance of another person but not vice versa. Chatterjee et al. [35]
tools as subordinate
deﬁned these types of technological
in other words,
tracking devices. Perpetrators can misuse these tools to gather
information about their victims covertly [36]. For example,
Westmarland et al. described Track Your Wife, a mobile
app that runs in the background of the device where it is
installed. The app periodically sends the time and the device’s
geolocation to a server. Using this information, a perpetrator
can know the device’s location (and,
the
location of the victim) [37]. Another example is the use of
auto-answer phones with the ringer set on silent. These types
of phones automatically answer calls. Perpetrators can leave
auto-answer phones in victims’ cars, houses, or other locations,
and call
the phone to listen in on victims’ conversations
without their knowledge. Using the information from these
calls, perpetrators can determine the recent activities of victims
and plan a suitable time and place to abuse them [38], [39].
Perpetrators can also use parental apps and track-my-pet types
of apps to monitor their victims [40]. Further, perpetrators can
use spyware [31], [32], [41]–[45], such as screen, audio-visual,
and voice-activated recorders [46].
Perpetrators use personal and mutual tracking technologies.
Chatterjee et al. deﬁned personal tracking apps as those that
are “intended for use solely by the owner of a phone” (e.g.,
ﬁnd-my-phone types of apps) and mutual tracking are “apps
that allow a group of people to track each other’s locations”
(e.g., apps to track family members) [35]. For example, the
location of victims who are ﬂeeing from perpetrators to various
shelters can be revealed by the GPS technology of their mobile
devices [47]. Many studies report various means by which
perpetrators misuse both personal and mutual tracking apps to
monitor victims discreetly [32], [35], [39], [40], [43], [48]–
[69]. Perpetrators can also surreptitiously use other technolo-
gies for surveillance, such as IoT devices [70]–[76], hidden
cameras [36], [37], [39], [40], [42], [46], [48], [55], [67], [77]–
[83], and many other types of technological tools [35], [40],
[44], [54], [56]–[65], [67], [83], [84].
Tracking functionalities are available by default on some
technological devices, providing more avenues for victim
surveillance. Tracking functionalities are provided within a
device’s operating system or by the service provider, which
means users cannot uninstall
these apps. Chatterjee et al.
outlined that “Android natively provides tracking functionality
via Find My Device, or via Google Maps’ unlimited location
sharing functionality. Assuming that the abuser has access
to the victim’s Google credentials, the abuser can remotely
turn on the Google Maps Timeline feature and obtain periodic
(even historical) information about the victim’s location” [35].
Apart from surveillance, perpetrators can subtly compro-
mise victims’ online accounts to impersonate them or use their
information. Researchers reported incidents where abusers had
garnered information about their victims from their compro-
mised accounts without their knowledge [77], [80]. Fraser et
al., for instance, described the case of a police ofﬁcer who
wanted revenge against his ex-girlfriend and gained control of
her email account. The ofﬁcer used her email to impersonate
her on a dating site and arranged for 70 men to meet up at
her home [77].

Fig. 1: Visual summary of how technology facilitates abuse (§IV). Solid lines indicate speciﬁc characteristics that enable
perpetrators’ capabilities, whereas dotted ones indicate ampliﬁcation.
The covertness trait creates a Big Brother effect, whereby
the perpetrator always has up-to-date information about the
victim and can have the upper hand over them. Because of how
discreetly technology is used, victims may not know about
abusers’ activities [33], [37], [77], [80], [82], [85], [86]. The
omnipresence and omniscience effect makes it hard for victims
to distance themselves from perpetrators, which leads to more
opportunities for abuse [77], [82].
Perpetrators coerce victims to indulge in sexual acts because
of the sensitive information perpetrators have about them. Per-
petrators can gather a signiﬁcant amount of information about
victims, including sensitive surveillance videos, images, or
audio recordings. To sexually abuse victims, perpetrators can
blackmail victims by threatening to share sensitive information
obtained from covertly monitoring them [42], [52], [67], [82],
[87]–[89]. Because of the fear that the perpetrators will make
good on the threat, victims keep engaging in sexual acts with
the perpetrators [90].
B. Publicness
In most cases, information kept on the Internet is public.
Unlike covertness that deals with collecting nonpublic infor-
mation about victims, publicness refers to publicly available
information that is created when a person uses technology.
Perpetrators use social media sites to gather information
about targets or victims. Much personal information is dis-
played on social networking and media sites. Through these
platforms, perpetrators can learn about their targets’ likes,
dislikes, interests, geolocation, school or workplace, and other
personal information. Perpetrators can then use the information
to build an online relationship with their targets and proceed
to off-line meetups to sexually abuse them [32], [39], [40],
[44], [67], [77], [82], [91]–[94]. Perpetrators can also learn
current information about their past victims to facilitate the
continuation of sexual abuse [50], [82], [93], [94].
Victims ﬁnd it challenging to avoid perpetrators monitor-
ing them using their publicly available information. Many
researchers report this challenge [32], [47], [82]. Sometimes
the perpetrators are still friends or connected to the victims’
friends or others in their networks on social media and other
online platforms. Therefore, the perpetrators can use these
platforms to get current information about the victims (e.g.,
the victim’s location and activities) through their friends on
social media. The perpetrator can use this information to
locate the victim and continue the sexual abuse [52], [82].
Further, victims living in shelters have difﬁculties hiding
their exact locations from perpetrators because of publicly
available social media information. Matthews et al. explained

the issue: “An important challenge in staying hidden was that
the abuser could use other people—such as the survivor’s
children, family, friends, colleagues, teachers, and so on—to
ﬁnd their contact or location information [online].” The paper
further reported that to stop perpetrators from using victims’
publicly available information, victims had to restrict their
children’s social media activities or block mutual friends the
victims have with the perpetrators [32].
The default settings of websites make information publicly
available. Using some online platforms can lead to the disclo-
sure of information that people do not want made public [32],
[52], [67], [69], [77]. For instance, Facebook allows people to
tag other users in posts or photos by default [95]. This can help
abusers determine their targets’ locations or recent activities
their targets have engaged in. Users would have to manually
change these settings.
Some apps facilitate the aggregation of publicly available
online data. Such aggregation can be useful to perpetrators.
Dimond et al. discussed an app, Google Buzz, which collated
people’s online identities from various websites. The authors
explained: “When Buzz launched, it disclosed all the names of
Gmail contacts publicly. For one blogger, this was extremely
problematic because the service automatically shared her com-
ments on Google Reader with her abusive ex-husband, which
resulted in the disclosure of the locations of her home and
work” [93]. Perpetrators have exploited similar apps [42].
can be seen in dating sites and apps. Perpetrators create false
online personas to build trust with their targets [77], [80], [90],
[106]. People can be more emotionally vulnerable on dating
sites and trust an appealing stranger more easily [80], [107].
Further, perpetrators can use a combination of technological
platforms. For instance, while the initial meeting could be
on a social media platform, the abuser could continue the
conversation using other technologies (e.g., text messages and
calls) to build social trust [91], [94], [103], [105], [108]–[110].
lead
to eventual in-person meetings. Perpetrators exploit the false
sense of connection, relationship, and trust provided by these
sites to facilitate off-line meetings and the sexual abuse
of targets [80], [90], [91], [98], [103], [105]. The idea of
conﬁdence and social trust is similar to the literature on how
con men gain their victims’ trust through conﬁdence games
(also known as cons) [111]–[114].
Anonymity and a heightened sense of social
trust
It is difﬁcult to hold a perpetrator accountable. Complex
layers of anonymity, such as the encryption of online commu-
nications, make it difﬁcult for law enforcement to identify and
apprehend perpetrators [115]–[117]. In addition, the multiple
technological tools used by perpetrators each have their own
layers of anonymity, adding to the difﬁculty of apprehending
perpetrators [42], [116]. Awareness of these challenges can
develop perpetrators’ conﬁdence and, therefore, a continuation
of the crime of sexual abuse [118].
C. Anonymity
D. Evolution
We deﬁned anonymity as the ability to hide one’s true
identity when using technological tools. Anonymity comes in
various forms when using the Internet or cellular devices.
Perpetrators can create false identities that facilitate in-
person meetings with targets [90], [94], [96]–[98]. The In-
ternet helps people hide under many layers of anonymity. For
instance, the Tor Internet web browser facilitates the protection
of people’s identity online by providing a secure network for
communication [99]. Perpetrators can create a false online per-
sona that people would most likely ﬁnd appealing and engage
with [91], [94], [100]. Multiple papers reported incidences
where the Internet facilitated anonymous grooming of targets
and eventual in-person meetings [90], [101], [102]. Further,
perpetrators can make multiple false identities by creating
many online accounts and proﬁles on websites [88], [91],
[101]–[103].
Perpetrators build social trust between themselves and their
targets. Social media is built on the network and concept of
friendships [104]. The anonymous friend feature of several
social networking sites helps victims trust perpetrators. Being
friends with strangers on some social media platforms can
make people assume they know a stranger when, in reality,
they do not [96]. Kloess et al. noted that the constant anony-
mous communication on the Internet helps “foster feelings of
belonging and a sense of community to form relationships and
build friendships” [94]. Victims reported increased friendliness
or a false sense of knowing perpetrators online before they met
in person [91], [96], [105]. Similarly, the idea of social trust
Technology is ever changing and ever evolving. New tech-
nologies are constantly being developed, and old technologies
are being improved.
Advances in technology are being weaponized. While the
evolution of technology is essential, it expands the perpetra-
tors’ repertoire [77], [96], [98], [119], [120]. Tools are used
in ways that were never intended, and perpetrators weaponize
technological evolution to scale up their offenses [37], [48],
[68], [87], [103], [121]. Perpetrators use various online plat-
forms to facilitate the distribution of unauthorized sexual
recordings [115], [122]. Real-time instant messaging services
increase the speed of communication between targets and
perpetrators [119]. Search engines, chat rooms, emails, online
dating sites, and mobile phones can aid perpetrators in locating
targets [79], [80], [90], [94], [97], [102], [103], [107], [119],
[123], [124]. Spyware and multiple IoT technologies can be
used to monitor targets and victims [30], [40], [70], [77], [91].
Perpetrators adapt as technology evolves. Many research
papers illustrated various ways perpetrators have adapted when
technological abuse tools are modiﬁed or taken away from
their toolbox [68], [103], [121].
E. Boundlessness
Boundlessness refers to technology’s lack of geographical
barriers. It is not conﬁned to a particular location. This trait
is mostly seen in Internet-based technologies.
The Internet’s boundlessness trait makes it easier for per-
petrators to form ties with other perpetrators, share tips and

strategies, and strengthen their network [96], [110]. Before the
Internet, such support and collaboration among perpetrators
would have been impossible [80], [91], [103], [110]. This
trait allows for more like-minded people to come together
on online platforms with the goal of bonding, exchanging
sexual fantasies,
identifying tools to aid surveillance, and
facilitating online and off-line sexual meetups with targets or
victims [100], [103]. Perpetrators use these communities to get
others interested in being part of sexual crimes. Kloess et al.
explained: “In terms of offending behavior, such communities
may also have changing effects on users’ views due to its sup-
port and understanding, as well as justifying and normalizing
features” [94], [96].
Further,
technology’s boundlessness opens up more op-
portunities for perpetrators to meet more targets from many
