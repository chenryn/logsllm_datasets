hi,
i have update to 0.14 version because i want to use a premade component which
requires it. i've spent an hour more trying to debug why nothing renders, then
i tried other components that worked, but they didn't render either.
then i googled and found that i need to require react-dom and ReactDOM.render
but this didn't help either. the render methods of all my components are not
being called at all
how is that possible?
