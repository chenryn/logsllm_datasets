I understand your situation and the challenges you're facing with a restricted work environment. Given that your work computer is running Mac OS X 10.6, which already includes Python, your best approach would be to find a portable code editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that can run directly from a USB drive. 

Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Portable Code Editors:**
   - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** Although VS Code itself is not natively portable, there are community-created portable versions available. You can download one of these and place it on your USB drive.
   - **Sublime Text:** Sublime Text can be made portable by simply copying the application folder to your USB drive. You can then launch it from there.

2. **Online IDEs:**
   - **Repl.it:** This is another online IDE that supports multiple programming languages and can be used as an alternative to ideone.com. It allows you to write, run, and share code directly in your browser.
   - **Jupyter Notebook:** If you need to work with Python and data, Jupyter Notebooks can be run locally if you can manage to get a portable version set up. There are some projects like `portable-jupyter` that aim to make this possible.

3. **Python Shell:**
   - Since Python is already installed on Mac OS X, you can use the built-in Python shell. However, without terminal access, this might be challenging. A portable editor with a built-in terminal or shell might be a better solution.

4. **Portable Python Environment:**
   - **WinPython:** While primarily designed for Windows, WinPython is a portable Python distribution. You might be able to find a similar portable Python environment for macOS, such as using a virtual environment created with `venv` or `virtualenv` and placing it on your USB drive.

By using a combination of a portable code editor and the built-in Python, you should be able to develop and run code locally on your work computer. I hope this helps, and good luck with your coding!
