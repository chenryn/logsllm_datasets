With the increasing popularity of games having a competitive element, cheats have become a common method for hackers to gain an advantage. These cheats could range from a sniper bullet that felt just a little too accurate to a player teleporting across the map, and chances are that you must have been outsmarted by some sort of cheat code. Some of the most common methods include Aimbot, Wallhack, SpeedHack, DropHack, etc.Game developers like Fortnite, PUBG, and Apex Legends constantly face pressure to prevent hackers from cheating. The result? Probably spending millions of dollars on Security and Anti-cheats, but are still being outsmarted by hackers.Due to the limited supply of skilled hackers and a huge demand, Game Cheat development has grown to be now a multi-million-dollar industry.
