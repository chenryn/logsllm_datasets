lower SNR). Thus our estimate of the effective BER in Eq. (1) will
accurately reﬂect the uncoded error performance of the link. Our
algorithm now proceeds as in the case of a ﬂat-fading channel de-
scribed above: we take the computed effective SNR value and use
the measurements from a ﬂat-fading link (Figure 1(a)) to determine
transmission success or failure. As in CHARM [10], we support
different packet lengths with different SNR thresholds.
Note that this procedure differs from the typical approach of
simulation-based analyses [11, 15, 19], that instead map the un-
coded BER estimate such as we compute to a coded BER esti-
mate by means of a simple log-linear approximation. They then
use the coded BER estimate, and the length of the target transmis-
sion, to directly compute the packet delivery rate of the link. We
believe our method of thresholding the effective SNR is better be-
cause it directly accommodates variation in the receiver implemen-
tation. Different devices may have different noise ﬁgures, a measure
of how much signal strength is lost in the internal RF circuitry of
the NIC. They may implement soft Viterbi decoders with more or
fewer soft bits for their internal state, or indeed might do hard de-
coding instead. A receiver could use the optimal Maximum Like-
lihood MIMO decoder that has exponential complexity for small
constellations like BPSK, but revert to the imperfect but more ef-
ﬁcient MMSE at higher modulations. All of these can be easily
expressed, albeit maybe approximately, as (perhaps modulation-
dependent) shifts in the effective SNR thresholds. In contrast, chang-
ing these parameters in the simulation approach involves changing
the internals of the calculation.
Protocol Details. Effective SNR calculations can be performed by
either receiver or transmitter, and each has advantages. For it to
make decisions, the transmitter must know the receiver’s thresholds

Each node is a stationary desktop or portable laptop equipped
with an Intel Wi-Fi Link 5300 (iwl5300) a/b/g/n wireless network
adapter. They run the Linux 2.6.34 kernel with a modiﬁed version
of the iwlagn driver [2]. These 802.11n MIMO NICs have three
antennas and support many new features of 802.11n.
We use up to three transmit and receive antennas, supporting
up to three MIMO streams, and the rates in Table 1 per stream.
This corresponds to equal modulation across streams deﬁned in the
802.11n standard.
Other physical layer parameters are set to 802.11a/g default val-
ues where possible, including 20 MHz channels and an 800 ns sym-
bol guard interval. Each testbed operates on a 5 GHz channel unoc-
cupied in its environment; there was no noticeable interference.
4.2 Measurement Tools
Our hardware enables us to vary the transmit power level from
−10 dBm to 16 dBm in steps of 0.5 dB, and divides power equally
across streams. For each received packet the NIC reports the tra-
ditional metrics of RSSI per receive antenna, noise ﬂoor and the
setting on the automatic gain controlled (AGC) ampliﬁer. These
combine to deﬁne the per-receive-chain packet SNR (ρpacket):
ρpacket = RSSI (dBm) − Noise (dBm) − AGC (dB)
(3)
The iwl5300 calculates the quantities RSSI and Noise as the re-
spective sums of average signal strength and average error vector
magnitude in each OFDM subcarrier [2]. This is exactly the tradi-
tional deﬁnition of SNR applied to OFDM.
Channel state information (CSI). The channel sounding mech-
anism added in 802.11n deﬁnes a management frame used to re-
port the CSI from the receiver of a frame back to the transmitter.
This mechanism is intended for calibration or to inform transmit
beamforming, and we co-opt it for our experiments. We conﬁgure
the NIC to compute this feedback packet for every received frame,
rather than just during sounding, and send it up to the driver in-
stead of back to the transmitter. The iwl5300 provides CSI in a
format that reports the channel matrices for 30 subcarrier groups,
which is about one group for every 2 subcarriers at 20 MHz. Each
channel matrix entry is a complex number, with signed 8-bit resolu-
tion each for the real and imaginary parts. It speciﬁes the gain and
phase of the spatial path between a single transmit-receive antenna
pair. Intel’s implementation of the 802.11n CSI does not include
per-subcarrier noise measurements, so we assume the noise ﬂoor is
uniform across all subcarriers to compute SNRs. This is consistent
with white noise observed on other OFDM platforms [20].
5. PACKET DELIVERY EVALUATION
In this section, we use our testbeds to experimentally evaluate
how well our model of §3 predicts packet delivery. This is the fun-
damental measure of whether the model is useful; good predictions
enable applications such as rate adaptation, transmit power control,
antenna selection, and channel selection.
5.1 Measurement setup
We ﬁrst measure packet delivery for different antenna conﬁgu-
rations over a 20 MHz channel on our testbeds. The 1x1 or SISO
conﬁguration corresponds to 802.11a, where each node has a sin-
gle transmit or receive antenna. In addition we measure conﬁgu-
rations with three receive antennas and 1, 2, or 3 spatial streams.
These 1x3, 2x3 and 3x3 MIMO conﬁgurations are only available
with 802.11n. They exploit spatial diversity and spatial multiplex-
ing to greatly increase performance.

Table 3: Width of 1x1 transition windows.
In each test, we send 1500 byte packets as constant bit-rate UDP
trafﬁc generated by iperf at 2 Mbps for 5 seconds. We turn off
link layer retransmissions to observe the underlying packet delivery
rate, and ﬁx the link data rate and the transmit power in each run.
Then we collect packet reception rate (PRR) statistics for all 8 rates
using 1, 2, and 3 spatial streams as we vary the power between
−10 dBm and 16 dBm in steps of 2 dB.
The receiver also records the CSI and per antenna RSSIs to mea-
sure the RF channel for each correctly received packet. Note that
CSI is measured during the preamble, so it does not depend on the
transmit rate. Similarly, 3x3 CSI gives us the channel between each
pair of transmit and receive antennas, so it also implicitly contains
1x1 CSI.
The above testing gives us ground truth data to probe variation
across 200 links, 26 dB of transmit power, four antenna conﬁgura-
tions ranging from 1x1 to 3x3, and 8 per stream rates (for 24 rates
with up to three streams). This covers all of the key variables in our
delivery model.
5.2 RSSIs and Multiple Antennas
Our model predicts packet delivery in terms of effective SNR as
described in §3. Our baseline to compare it with is RSSI-based
predictions of delivery. This is simple enough for the 1x1 case of
a single transmit and receive antenna: we convert the single RSSI
value to a packet SNR using Eq. (3), which is then mapped to packet
delivery for the transmit rate that is used.
However, there is a complication when there are three antennas
in the multi-antenna modes. There are now three RSSIs — how
should they be used? We ﬁrst convert the per-antenna RSSIs to
SNRs and then sum the SNRs. This is a straightforward choice for
a single spatial stream as it corresponds to receiver processing using
MRC [8]. It is also reasonable for 2- and 3-stream MIMO because
the streams are interleaved.
5.3 Results
Transition Windows. To compare our model with RSSI, we ﬁrst
analyze our 1x1 measurements to ﬁnd the transition windows for
all of the links in testbed T1. We deﬁne this to be the effective SNR
or packet SNR values over which packet delivery rises from 10%
(lossy) to 90% (reliable) for any link.
Table 3 gives the width of the transition window (denoted ∆ρ)
for 1x1 rates using these SNR metrics. We show the 25–75% range
of points in the transition window as a measure of the typical link,
and the 5–95% range as a measure of most links. A good result here
is a narrow window like that measured over a wire (Figure 1(a)).
We see that the transition widths are consistently tight with our
model. Most links transition within a window of around 2 dB for
most rates. The width of the RSSI-based transition windows is typi-
cally two to three times looser, especially for the denser modulation
schemes like QAM-64 and higher code rates. This means that it is

easy for a less than ideal channel to degrade the reception of high
rates.2 However, while the transitions for the last four rates are in-
ﬂated with RSSI, they remain tight with effective SNR.
The results for effective SNR are in fact about the best that can
be obtained because they are close to textbook transitions for ﬂat-
fading channels and those measured over a wire (Figure 1(a)). A
small improvement is surely possible, but this is probably limited
by the precision of our measurement data. Our NIC gives RSSI,
AGC and noise values in dB to the nearest integer, and at most 8
bit CSI over a 24 dB range for 30 out of 56 subcarriers. With these
factors, quantization error of at least 1 dB is likely.
The larger signiﬁcance of narrow transition windows is that, by
reducing them enough that they do not overlap, we are able to un-
ambiguously predict the highest rate that will work for all links
nearly all of the time. In contrast, RSSI transition window over-
lap such that for a given RSSI we have seen ﬁve different rates be
the highest rate in our testbed. We explore this next.
Rate Confusion. To understand how transition windows map to
packet delivery predictions, we analyze our measurements for the
highest supported rate (PRR≥ 90%) for each link and all NIC set-
tings. The results are shown in Figure 6, broken down by antenna
conﬁguration. Figure 6(a) shows 1x1 rates for T1 and T2 links

experiments to tackle QAM-64 as a challenge case; most imple-
mentations have reached QAM-16 at best.
combined. Figure 6(b)–6(d) show rates for 1x3, 2x3 and 3x3 con-
ﬁgurations for T1 links; T1 is denser than T2 and supports MIMO
experiments over our NIC’s transmit power range. For each RSSI-
based SNR or effective SNR value, we ﬁnd the best link (with the
fastest best rate) and the worst link (with the slowest best rate). We
plot the spread of their fastest rates in these graphs.3
Ideally, the best and worst lines would overlap completely. That
is, the highest rate for a given SNR would be the same for the best
and worst links. This rate would then be an accurate prediction for
the effective SNR or packet SNR level. Conversely, gaps between
the best and worst lines expose confusion about which rate will be
the highest rate for that SNR.
In the top two lines of the 1x1 and 3x3 cases, we see that the
RSSI-based SNR does have a large spread between the best and
worst lines. Except for extremely low and high SNRs, nearly all
SNRs have at least two and up to ﬁve different rates as suitable
choices for the best rate. That is, RSSI often poorly indicates rate.
In sharp contrast, the two effective SNR lines overlap almost all
the time, and mostly appear to be a single line. This is almost an
ideal result. Effective SNR is a clear indicator of best rate. When
there is slight separation, the spread is only between rates that use
the same modulation but different amounts of coding. These com-
binations are also close together in our wired experiments.

very few links experience loss at that rate.
