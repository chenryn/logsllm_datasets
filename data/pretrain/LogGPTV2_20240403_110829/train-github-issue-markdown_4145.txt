 **Describe the feature** :
Currently, by setting server_side_encryption to true, the only method that is
allowed is aes256. It would be great if we could specify other s3 encryption
methods, e.g. aws:kms.
For aws:kms, if the bucket has a default key, it's just a matter of including
the correct header, so one possibility may be an additional parameter to
specify the value of the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` header to get sent
with requests. But the ability to specify an ams key to use would also be
great.
