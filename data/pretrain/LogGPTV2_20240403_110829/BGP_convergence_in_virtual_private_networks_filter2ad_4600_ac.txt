IPv4 BGP convergence delays [5, 8]. First, the convergence
delays in MPLS VPNs are much shorter than those in IPv4
BGP, in which convergence delays on average are longer than
100 seconds for Tdown and Tlong are more than 30 seconds in
Tup and Tshort
[5, 8]. This is due to several reasons. First
of all, IPv4 BGP has a much bigger topology scale (thou-
sands of ASes) than MPLS VPN networks. Thus the IPv4
BGP update propagation time along the ASes, ampliﬁed by
MRAI delay, is longer than in MPLS VPN networks. Also
because the simpler route reﬂector-based topology limits the
number of alternative paths, there are much less path explo-
ration in MPLS VPNs. Third, the default MRAI time value
for iBGP is 5 seconds, while in eBGP it is 30 seconds.
Second, Figure 3 shows that the delays of Tup and Tshort
are longer than those of Tdown and Tlong. This observation
is diﬀerent from the eBGP convergence results in [5, 8], but
they are not conﬂicting. In the measurements reported in [5,
8], an event starts when the initial announcement or with-
drawal are advertised, but in our methodology, an event
In Tup and
starts when a layer 1/layer2 change happens.
Tshort, it takes time for the PE and CE to exchange BGP
protocol messages, following the Finite State Machine spec-
iﬁcation [11], to establish a BGP session. After that, the
routes are exchanged. Depending on the size and the order
of the routes in the routing table, the announcement of the
preﬁx in question can be further delayed. In practice, it is
helpful to have a shorter Tup delay in some cases such as a
simple router reboot during planned maintenance. There-
fore, this suggests that further research and engineering are
needed to shorten the time to establish the BGP sessions
and initial table exchanges after a session is setup.
5.2 Breaking down Tlong convergence
We now break down the Tlong convergence factors. We
measure the session failure detection time as the time from
the beginning of the event to the time the ﬁrst BGP update
is received. To measure the path exploration time, we ﬁrst
found the time (say, T3) for the ﬁrst update with an as-
path equal to the primary aspath, and the originator/BGP
nexthop equal to the primary PE. Then we ﬁnd the time for
the withdrawal message (say T4). Then the path exploration
time is deﬁned as T4 − T3. The route invisibility’s contribu-
tion is T5 − T4, where T5 is the end of the convergence.
Figure 4 shows distributions of the delay contribution of
the diﬀerent factors contributing to Tlong.
It shows that
failure detection contributes the most, closely followed by
route invisibility (both contribute around 10 seconds in 90%
of events). On the other hand, path exploration contributes
least in MPLS VPNs, as opposed to the Internet environ-
ment where it is the dominant factor. As we mentioned
earlier, in MPLS VPNs there are much fewer paths to “ex-
plore” due to its smaller and simpler route reﬂector-based
topology. In addition, we found that that 30% of the events
have route failure (during which either there is no route or
the failed primary path is used) for longer than 9 seconds.
These results show that it is very important to improve the
Tlong convergence delay to minimize signiﬁcant disruptions
to important applications such as VoIP, and that in order
to improve Tlong convergence, shortening failure detection
time and solving route invisibility are more important than
solving path exploration.
5.3 Event Contribution by Network Entity
In IPv4 BGP, it has been observed that the majority of
the events are caused by a small number of very unstable
preﬁxes [12]. In this section, we investigate whether similar
observations hold for VPNv4 preﬁxes, as well as for other
MPLS VPN speciﬁc “network entities” namely, VPNs, PEs,
and PE-CE interfaces. We ﬁrst ranked (from high to low)
the entities based on the number of events per entity. Then
we determined the cumulative ranked contribution of each
of the four network entities to the total convergence event
count. We found signiﬁcant “popularity” in the network
entities that are involved with convergence events. More
speciﬁcally, only 18.6% of preﬁxes contributed to 90% of the

convergence events. The number is approximately the same
(17%) for RDs, while the PE-CE interface granularity has an
even more skewed distribution with only 6.6% of interfaces
contributing to 90% of the events. Considering the router
level granularity, we see a somewhat less skewed distribution
where 42.9% of PEs contribute to 90% of events.
6. SOLUTION AND EVALUATION
In this section we summarize and evaluate our proposed
solutions [10] to the delayed convergence in MPLS VPN.
To shorten the failure detection time, “Next-Hop Track-
ing (NHT)” [1] or similar features should be enabled on PE
routers. The route invisibility problem can be easily elimi-
nated by conﬁguration changes to force the backup route to
be distributed to the remote PEs. That is, we can conﬁg-
ure PEs such that they always prefer their locally learned
eBGP route (over iBGP routes), and conﬁgure the VRFs
from diﬀerent sites of a VPN with diﬀerent RDs.
In Figure 5, we estimate the improvement of the our solu-
tions based on our Tlong measurement results. Supposing we
have a fast detection mechanism (e.g., like Next-hop track-
ing) in place we can expect to see detection times around
1 second. We can thus estimate the potential improvement
by replacing the measured failure detection time with this
value. The “fast-detection” curve in Figure 5 shows signiﬁ-
cant improvements over the current convergence delay.
However, the fast-detection curve also shows that 20% of
the delays are longer than 6 seconds, and 10% are longer
than 15 seconds. This shows the necessity of eliminating
route invisibility. The curve “fast-detection + no route-
invisibility” estimates the improvement when route invisi-
bility is eliminated in addition to the fast failure detection.
It shows that the convergence time is signiﬁcantly reduced
(what is left is the path exploration contribution plus the
assumed 1 second fast detection delay). The ﬁnal curve in
Figure 5 shows the improvement of using a shorter iBGP
MRAI value (0.5 second) by dividing the measured path ex-
ploration time by 10(= 5/0.5). The ﬁgure shows that the
additional improvement by using a smaller MRAI value is
insigniﬁcant, and thus may not warrant the additional load
incurred by such an approach.
Based on these results, we conclude that the combination
of fast failure detection and route invisibility elimination are
necessary and suﬃcient conﬁguration changes to achieve a
short convergence delay in MPLS VPN networks.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper we have presented the ﬁrst systematic study
of BGP convergence in MPLS VPNs. We used several data
sources from a Tier-1 ISP and developed a methodology that
allows accurate estimation of BGP convergence delays. We
identiﬁed contributing factors such as path exploration in
iBGP and the information hiding in the form of the route
invisibility problem. Our analysis show that, among the
contributing factors, failure detection and route invisibil-
ity have the most signiﬁcant impact on convergence delays.
Fortunately, suitable solutions exist to eliminate or mitigate
these problems. Our measurement-based estimation shows
that applying our proposed conﬁguration-only changes to
MPLS VPNs can signiﬁcantly reduce the convergence delay.
Our work has also uncovered a number of results. For
example, the fact that a relative small percentage of entities
(preﬁxes, RDs, PEs, interfaces) are responsible for the bulk
of events might indicate some underlying problems. Given
the importance of MPLS VPNs to the commercial world,
these results warrant further investigation.
