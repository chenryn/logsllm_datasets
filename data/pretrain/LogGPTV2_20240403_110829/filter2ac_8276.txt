### Title: Black Hat US-22: XMPP Stanza Smuggling or How I Hacked Zoom

**Abstract:**

XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is a widely used instant messaging protocol based on XML, commonly employed in various applications such as messengers, online games, and more. This presentation introduces a novel method of attacking XMPP client software: XMPP stanza smuggling.

The talk will delve into how seemingly minor peculiarities in XML parsing can be exploited to "smuggle" attacker-controlled XMPP control messages to the victim's client. It will also explore how the design of the XMPP protocol makes it particularly vulnerable to such attacks. The presentation will demonstrate how these vulnerabilities led to zero-click remote code execution in the Zoom client.

While the Zoom client will be used as a case study to illustrate the potential impact, the discussed XMPP vulnerabilities are not unique to Zoom and could affect other XMPP-based applications as well.
