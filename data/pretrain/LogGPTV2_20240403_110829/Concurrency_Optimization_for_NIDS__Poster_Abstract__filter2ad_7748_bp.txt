PRESENTING AUTHOR: Dae Young Lee, Department of Herbal Crop Research, National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science,  
RDA, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Dahye Yoon, Bo-Ram Choi, Jae-Suk Ban, Ryong Gong, Young-Seob Lee, Geum-Soog Kim
The root of Panax ginseng CA Meyer has been widely used as ingredients for traditional medicines and functional foods Furthermore, not only raw 
ginseng but also several processed ginseng products have been used in the food industry and herbal markets According to the distinct processing 
methods, there are four processed P ginseng products including white ginseng (WG), tae-geuk ginseng (TG), red ginseng (RG), and black ginseng 
(BG) In this study, HR-MAS NMR and UPLC-QTOF/MS-based metabolomics approaches were applied to assess the metabolic compositions of four 
processed ginseng In the results of HR-MAS NMR, primary metabolites were identified such as sugars and amino acids In the multivariate analyses 
of NMR spectra, PCA score plot showed that TG and RG were clustered each other, and discriminated from WG and BG The main metabolites 
causing these cluster were sucrose and maltose Maltose and sucrose were not detected in the WG and BG, respectively In PCA score plot, four 
groups of processed ginseng were well differentiated OPLS-DA was also performed to discriminate two selected samples Several ginsenosides 
were found as the key components to differentiate four ginseng products UPLC-QTOF/MS with an in-house library was used to profile ginsenosides 
from these four ginseng products The numbers of identified ginsenosides from the four products were as follows: WG (n=26), TG (n=28), RG (n=34), 
and BG (n=36)

The effect of storage on the metabolite profile and antibactirial activity of Plectranthus madagascariensis
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mhlonipheni Msomi, University of South Africa, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Gerhard Prinsloo
Plectranthus madagascariensis is a garden plant native to South Africa that is used to treat minor ailments The study was conducted to investigate 
metabolite changes of P madagascariensis using NMR based metabolomics and how it affects antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus 
Different storage conditions and the effect of storage conditions on the antibacterial activity of the plant were investigated In the NMR-based 
metabolomics analysis, the supervised OPLS-DA separated samples that were stored in -80C from those that were stored in the fridge and room 
temperature Longer storage time of the leaf samples did not make a difference as the samples were scattered with no clustering observed Drying 
conditions had no effect on metabolite profile in samples that were stored in different drying conditions The resazurin-based assay demonstrated 
samples stored for one month was not active as most of them had a MIC of 1 mg/ml The antibacterial activity of extracts tested after three months 
increased Extracts that were stored in -80C immediately after drying were unable to inhibit bacterial growth with the MIC values of 1 mg/ml The 
best MIC value was 0015 mg/ml for plants that were grown in the shade, dried in the sun and stored at room temperature The extracts stored at room 
temperature showed different MIC values compared to extracts in the fridge, with generally better activity in samples stored at room temperature

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alice Bellisai, Rothamsted Research, United Kingdom
CO-AUTHORS: Gianluca Ruvo, Charlotte Lomax, Michael H. Beale, Jane L. Ward
Willow is well known for the presence of phenolic glycosides, including the famous compound Salicin from which the well-known drug Aspirin 
was later developed Terpenes, abundant in many plants are however less well known in members of the Salicaceae such as willow and poplar 
Rothamsted Research maintains the National Willow Collection (NWC) as a short-rotation coppice plantation at Rothamsted Research Comprising 
1500 accessions, this germplasm resource is a rich source of novel chemistry which is being systematically screened by metabolomics A family of 
novel terpene alcohol diglycosides have been identified which show a variety of carbohydrate components in their diglycoside moiety Compounds 
have been isolated from Salix genotypes by HPLC and their structures were elucidated by LC-HRMS-MS and 1D and 2D NMR We will demonstrate 
the diversity in both terpenoid and glycoside components, including data describing both pyranose and furanose forms Finally, we will illustrate 
how particular molecules are species specific

Response of bush tea’s (Athrixia phylicoides DC.) biochemical constituents to Kelpak® application using the LC-MS/MS triple 
quadrupole and 1H NMR techniques
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Keletso Mohale, University of South Africa, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Kafua Lodama, Mudau Fathuwani Nixwell
Biostimulants from seaweed such as Kelpak® (Ecklonia maxima O) extracts have gained significance in agriculture and improved yields and quality 
of various crops However, the effect of Kelpak® (E maxima) on bush tea’s (Athrixia phylicoides DC) phytoconstituents has not been explored 
The objective of this study was therefore to assess the influence of Kelpak® biostimulant on bush tea’s chemical profile using LC-MS/MS triple 
quadrupole mass spectrometer and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy The treatments consisted of 02%, 01%, 005% Kelpak® 
and control (00%) arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) Kelpak® application stimulated bush tea plant height and increased number 
of lateral branches produced The study also revealed that bush tea’s primary metabolites including amino acids, organic acids and vitamins were 
enhanced by application of 02% Kelpak® The partial least squares–discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated four distinct groups of bush tea 
samples treated with different levels of Kelpak® Based on the 1D NMR spectrum prediction putative annotation of metabolites resulted in detection 
of 32 metabolites with varying intensities The application of 02% Kelpak® demonstrated high intensities of the detected compounds and could thus 
be recommended for improved bush tea plant growth and biochemical constituents

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Pingping Liu, Zhengzhou Tobacco Research Institute of CNTC, China
CO-AUTHORS: Liu Pingping, Chen Qiansi, Zhang Hui, Zheng Qingxia, Xu Guoyun, Zhai Niu, Wang Chen, Jin Lifeng, Cao Peijian, Zhou Huina
Metabolomics can be used to characterize the metabolites after various internal and external environmental disturbances (gene changes or 
environment changes)[1-2] Metabolites are the material basis of formation of tobacco flavor The flavor of tobacco directly affected by the changes of 
metabolites concentration Before the previous research, the flavor of tobacco has a high correlation with the location and the climate environment 
In this study, the mature tobacco leaves (middle leaf of fresh tobacco at maturity stage) from 20 sampling sites were collected (including three 
traditional flavor types) on a national scale, and the metabolic characteristics of these samples were analyzed The characteristic metabolites which 
were closely related to flavor style were investigated The result revealed that, 21 metabolites were related to heavy-flavor type, 16 metabolites were 
related to fen-flavor type and 10 metabolites were related to neutral-flavor type The metabolic pathways enrichment results indicated that, the lipid 
metabolism level of heavy-flavor tobacco leaves was higher, especially the glycolipid metabolism The triglyceride metabolism level of fen-flavor 
tobacco was higher and the sugar metabolism level was low The ascorbic acid salt synthesis and metabolism of neutral-flavor type tobacco leaves 
was also strong

Metabolomic analysis of headspace volatiles of Plectranthus neochilus Schltr. (Lamiaceae)
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Alexandra Sawaya, FCF-UNICAMP, Brazil
CO-AUTHORS: Maria Isabel Galbiatti, Guilherme Perez Pinheiro, Elisa Ribeiro Antunes, Vinícius Veri Hernandes, Marcos Nogueira Eberlin
Plectranthus neochilus Schltr (Lamiaceae) is popularly known as boldo in Brazil and used for digestive problems, similar to the Chilean plant, 
Peumus boldus The essential oil was proven to be schistosomicidal, antimicrobial and reduced whitefly colonization in tomato crops Despite these 
promising activities, there were no studies in the literature on the variability of its essential oil throughout the year Samples were collected from 
four individuals grown in the field (monthly, morning and afternoon) and inside a greenhouse All the collected leaves were immediately frozen 
Prior to analysis the samples were crushed in liquid nitrogen, a 500 mg aliquot of each was sampled by SPME fiber (PDMS / DVB) and inserted in 
GC-MS (Agilent) using an automatic injector (splitless), temperature gradient 60 -246 ° C at a rate of 3 ° C / min QC samples were analyzed every 
16 samples The chromatograms were aligned and the features extracted by XCMS-Online, chemometrics by Online MetaboAnalyst and GraphPad 
Prism 601 software for ANOVA One compound, 1-octen-3-ol was a marker for the afternoon samples in the field and the greenhouse samples for all 
individuals This compound is present in edible mushrooms, but in plants only one study related it activation of defense genes Possibly high solar 
incidence in the afternoon and high temperatures in the greenhouse caused environmental stress for P neochilus plants There was, however, no 
significant monthly variation of the volatiles, indicating that it is possible to harvest leaves throughout the year

Metabolic responses to potassium availability and waterlogging reshape respiration and carbon use efficiency in oil palm
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jing Cui, Australian National University, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Marlène Davanture, Michel Zivy, Cathleen Mirande-Ney , Emmanuelle Lamade, Guillaume Tcherkez
Oil palm is a strong potassium (K)-demanding species cultivated in regions where soil K availability is generally low and waterlogging caused by 
tropical heavy rains can limit further nutrient absorption However, the metabolic effects of K and waterlogging have never been assessed precisely 
This is very surprising because most tropical or wet areas where rice, sunflower, oil palm and other important crops are cultivated combine these 
two environmental constraints The aim of this study was to understand the overall impact of waterlogging and limited K availability on metabolism, 
and to understand how such advert environmental conditions reshape the carbon balance in oil palm Here, we examined the metabolic response 
of oil palm saplings in the greenhouse under controlled conditions (nutrient composition with low or high K availability, with or without waterlogging) 
using gas exchange, metabolomics and proteomics analyses Our results show that both low K and waterlogging have a detrimental effect on 
photosynthesis but clearly stimulate leaf respiration, thereby impacting the carbon use efficiency Omics analyses show differential accumulation of 
typical metabolic intermediates and enzymes not only of the Krebs cycle but also of alternative catabolic pathways In addition, we found a strong 
relationship between metabolic composition and the rate of leaf dark respiration Overall, advert environmental conditions have an enormous 
impact on respiration in oil palm Leaf metabolome and proteome appear to be good predictors not only of K availability but also of CO2 efflux, and 
this opens avenues for cultivation biomonitoring using functional genomics technologies

Assessment of the arsenic exposure in rice (Oryza sativa japonica): Combining untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Miriam Pérez Cova, IDAEA-CSIC, and Universitat de Barcelona, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Miriam Pérez-Cova, Romà Tauler, Joaquim Jaumot
Arsenic polluted soils have a direct effect on edible plants-base foods such as rice (Oryza sativa japonica) Metabolomics and lipidomics strategies 
aid to achieve a better understanding of how arsenic is assimilated and translocated, and the main metabolic pathways affected by this pollutant 
Two As exposures were applied during the first three weeks of rice growth in an environmental chamber: by irrigation (1 or 1000 μM) and settled 
in soil before planting (5 or 50 ppm) Aerial parts and roots were collected, extracted (using two extraction protocols, for metabolites and lipids) 
and analyzed separately Metabolomics LC-MS analysis was conducted using a TSK Gel Amide-80 HILIC column and a Thermo OrbitrapQExactive 
mass spectrometer operating in both, Full MS and All Ion Fragmentation mode Lipidomics LC-MS analysis employed a Kinetex C8 column and a 
Waters LCT PremierToF Ionization source for metabolomic and lipidomic analysis was Electrospray in positive and negative mode Workflow for 
metabolomics (W4m) platform was used for preprocessing, and multivariate tools (PCA, PLS-DA, ASCA) from Metaboanalyst were employed in the 
subsequent data analysis Results obtained after chemometric analysis show that only the highest As concentration levels (both in irrigation water 
or settled in soil) allowed the differentiation when compared with control samples (without arsenic treatment) No clear differentiation was found 
between the low concentration samples from both treatments and control samples Finally, metabolomics and lipidomics results were integrated to 
have a more comprehensive overview of As exposure effects in rice, by combining the new hypotheses coming from the detected compounds

A novel method for identification and quantification of sulfated flavonoids in plants by neutral loss scan mass spectrometry
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sabine Metzger, University of Cologne, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Niklas Kleinenkuhnen, Felix Büchel, Silke C. Gerlich, Stanislav Kopriva
Sulfur is present in plants in a large range of essential primary metabolites, as well as in numerous natural products Many of these secondary 
metabolites contain sulfur in the oxidized form of organic sulfate However, except of glucosinolates, very little is known about other classes of 
such sulfated metabolites, mainly because of lack of specific and quantitative analytical methods We developed an LC-MS method to analyse 
sulfated flavonoids, a group of sulfated secondary metabolites prominent, eg, in plants of the genus Flaveria The method uses a linear gradient of 
methanol/formic acid in water on a Restek Raptor C18 Core-Shell column for separation of the compounds The sulfated flavonoids are detected by 
mass spectrometry (MS) in a negative mode, using a neutral loss of 80 Da after a collision induced dissociation With this method we were also able 
to quantify the sulfated flavonoids We could detect all (mono)sulfated flavonoids described before in Flaveria plus a number of new ones, such as 
isorhamnetin-sulfate-glycoside In addition, we showed that sulfated flavonoids represent a substantial sulfur pool in Flaveria, larger than the thiols 
glutathione and cysteine The individual species possess different sulfated flavonoids, but there is no correlation between the qualitative pattern 
and type of photosynthesis Similar to other sulfur-containing secondary compounds, the concentration of sulfated flavonoids in leaves is reduced 
by sulfur starvation The new LC-MS method will enable qualitative and quantitative detection of these secondary metabolites in plants as a pre-
requisite to addressing their functions

Metabolomics, a powerful tool to investigate the relationship between genotype and phynotype, attracts an increasing amount of attention 
Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry, such as UPLC-QTOF, has become a dominant 
technique in metabolic studies, particularly for untargeted metabolomics An obvious advantage of UPLC-QTOF-based untargeted metabolomics is 
that thousands of components can be simultaneously analyzed, possessing two great challenges for users to data analysis and identify metabolites 
Toward these challenges, we constructed an automatic UPLC-HRMS data analysis software, named AntDAS and a freely accessible metabolite 
database, named TMMLib AntDAS can be perform data analysis to effective and efficiently extract features of metabolites in samples, whose output 
involving high-accuracy m/z values, retention time can be directly imported into the TMMLib for compound identification TMMLib includes an 
annotated list of known metabolite structural information and their MS-MS spectra from tobacco TMMLib can realize single and batch searches, as 
well as MS-MS searches AntDAS and TMMLib will be regularly updated and to greatly benefit future metabolomics studies in plant TMMLib is freely 
available at http://tmmlibtobaccodborg and the AntDAS code is available from http://softwaretobaccodborg/software/antdas

BreedWheat (wwwbreedwheatfr) and ArchiRac (wwwfsovorg) are French national projects aiming at providing new tools and materials for wheat 
breeding, thereby increasing and facilitating the use of original genetic resources to improve allelic variability in the elite wheat (Triticum aestivum 
L) gene pool A large panel of elite winter-wheat varieties was selected to cover the diversity present in French material and phenotyped in multi-
environment trials to identify tolerance traits and QTLs within the BreedWheat project In addition, two young plants per genotype were cultivated 
in controlled conditions within specially designed containers (Jeudy et al 2016, Plant Methods 12: 31) for high-throughput root-phenotyping for 
three weeks of vegetative growth within the ArchiRac project Six reference genotypes were used to account for block variation in the experimental 
design The largest fully-emerged leaf of each plant was harvested in the morning, rapidly frozen and lyophilized for biochemical studies Robotized 
targeted analyses of major metabolites and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS) were used to assess the 
biological variation of primary and specialized metabolites as well as starch and total protein content Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses 
were used to mine the profiles of all genotypes Compositional distances between genotypes were calculated and visualized using clustering in 
order to compare metabolic and molecular similarities Metabolomic data will be further combined to other phenotyping data to search for metabolic 
biomarkers that will link to plant performance Acknowledgements: MetaboHUB (ANR-11-INBS-0010), PHENOME (ANR-11-INBS-0012), BreedWheat

Metabolic flux may active through freeze drying process of tobacco leaves
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Huina Zhou, Zhengzhou Tabacco Research Institute of CNTC, China
CO-AUTHORS: Qiansi Chen, Pingping Liu, Qingxia Zheng, Niu Zhai, Huina Zhou
To fully investigate the effects of vaccum freeze drying on the metabolome of tobacco leaves, the fresh-frozen samples in liquid nitrogen 
were divided into 3 aliquots, one kept at frozen as fresh samples and the left two freeze-dried under controlled or uncontrolled shelve surface 
temperature as FD1 and FD2 samples, respectively Three kinds of samples were balanced in equal dry weight, and analyzed by GC-MS and LC-Q-
TOF with six replicates to collect their metabolome data A total of 79 and 99 metabolites were identified by GC-MS and LC-Q-TOF, respectively 
PCA score plots showed that freeze-dried smaples (FD1 and FD2) did different from fresh-frozen samples in metabolomics level, and LC-Q-TOF 
analysis also revealed a clear difference resulted by controlled shelve surface temperature Furthermore, based on VIP list and T-test analyses, a 
tendency was found that different metabolites identified by GC-MS usually decreased upon freeze drying, while different metabolites identified by 
LC-Q-TOF were mostly increased Considering the category of different metabolites, sugars, organic acids and amino acids usually down-regulated, 
while terpenoids and polyphenol/flavonoids usually up-regulated by freeze-drying, the different in metabolome after freeze-drying may result by the 
active metabolic flux from primary metabolites to secondary metabolites, besides the volatilization of some volatile compounds And we also found 
that freeze-drying with controlled shelve surface temperature might slow down the metabolic flux, since the total levels of different metabolites in 
FD 1 were closer to Fresh samples other than FD2

A combination of high-throughput metabolomics with genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can contribute to the identification of genes 
underlying metabolic diversity and their relevance to complex traits, such as metabolite levels, in different accessions of the same species In this 
research project, the metabolic profiles of 14-day-old seedlings from 225 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions in 5 biological replicates were analyzed 
by untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry Across all chromatograms, 4479 m/z features segregated as binary traits, ie being 
absent or present Co-segregation analyses with SNPs, obtained from a previously published 250k SNP chip data set (Horton et al, 2012), is 
currently being performed In total, 1311 associations (Fisher’s exact test P value < 1x10-10) containing 1046 unique genes were found between the 
SNPs and absence/presence of 194 m/z features Focusing on the structurally characterized m/z features, 3 glucosinolates were associated to the 
MAM2 locus, known to be involved in the biosynthesis of this class of metabolites In addition, an association between three characterized flavonol-
glycosides and the BGLU6 gene was found Moreover, an association between isoleucin and malonyl-isoleucin and DAAR1 could be retrieved 
Supported by these previously proven associations, this method will be applied to find new gene-metabolite links Horton, MW et al Genome-wide

Integrated metabolome and transcriptome analysis of plants identifies biosynthetic pathways for floral volatile organic compounds
PRESENTING AUTHOR: In-Cheol Jang, Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory, Singapore
CO-AUTHORS: Savitha Dhandapani
Plants emit a number of floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as secondary metabolites that have ecological functions for their defence against 
herbivores and pathogens as well as for the pollinator attraction Plant VOCs are mainly composed of terpenoids, phenylpropanoids/benzenoids, 
and volatile fatty acid derivatives, which are derived from different biosynthetic routes in plants The diversity of plant VOCs has stimulated broad 
systems biology approaches to identify the pathways/genes involved in their biosynthesis We integrate metabolome and transcriptome analysis 
of aromatic flowers to unravel biosynthetic pathways for floral VOCs Our metabolite-guided transcriptomics and molecular and biochemical 
characterization of genes have identified specific gene members encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of diverse floral scents Here, we
