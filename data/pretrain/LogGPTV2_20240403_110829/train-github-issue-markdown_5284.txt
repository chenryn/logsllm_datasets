  * Electron version: 1.3.3
  * Operating system: win10
What I do:
  1. Use typescript to compile a react project with sourcemap enabled.
  2. Do not use any package tools like webpack or browerify, aka, directly use require() in browser process.
  3. Open the electron instance to debug.
What I expect:
  1. The chromium source panel can display tsx files using sourcemaps.
What I get:
  1. The source panel can only display the tsx souce files in the root dir, which includes our index.html and main process js file. The components tsx files in some folders do not show up.
What I try:
  1. I try to use the inlineSourcemap or set the sourceRoot property, then I get a tsx blank page. What happened?
Please help me, thanks!
