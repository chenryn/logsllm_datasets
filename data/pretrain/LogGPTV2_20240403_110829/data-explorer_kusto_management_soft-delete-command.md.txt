# .delete table records - soft delete command
To soft delete individual records without a system guarantee that the storage artifacts containing these records are deleted as well, use the following command. This command marks records as deleted but doesn't necessarily delete the data from storage artifacts. For more information, see [Soft delete](../concepts/data-soft-delete.md).
To delete individual records with a system guarantee that the storage artifacts containing these records are deleted as well, see [Data purge](../concepts/data-purge.md).
## Syntax
`.delete` [`async`] `table` *TableName* `records` [`with` `(` *propertyName* `=` *propertyValue* [`,` ...]`)`] ` [!NOTE]
> The following restrictions apply to the *Predicate*:
>
> * The predicate should have at least one `where` operator.
> * The predicate can only use the following operators: `extend`, `where` and `project`.
> * The predicate can't reference other tables, nor use `externaldata`.
## Supported properties
|Name|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`whatif`| `bool` |If `true`, returns the number of records that will be deleted in every shard, without actually deleting any records. The default is `false`.
## Returns
The output of the command contains information about which extents were replaced.
## Example: delete records of a given user
To delete all the records that contain data of a given user:
```kusto
.delete table MyTable records  [!NOTE]
> The same restrictions on the *Predicate* mentioned for table apply here as well.
> Soft delete might fail in case of conflicts with the [materialization process](materialized-views/materialized-view-overview.md#how-materialized-views-work) running in the background. Retrying the operation can help in this case. To avoid conflicts, you can [disable the materialized view](materialized-views/materialized-view-enable-disable.md) before executing soft delete, and re-enable it when the operation completes.
> Usage of function [materialized_view()](../query/materialized-view-function.md) is not allowed in *Predicate*.
## Supported properties - materialized views
|Name|Type|Description|
|--|--|--|
|`whatif`| `bool` |If `true`, returns the number of records that will be deleted in every shard, without actually deleting any records. The default is `false`.
## Example - materialized views
To delete all the materialized view records that contain data of a given user:
```kusto
.delete materialized-view MyMaterializedView records <| MyMaterializedView | where UserId == 'X'
```
## Example: check how many records would be deleted from a materialized view
To determine the number of records that would be deleted by the operation without actually deleting them, check the value in the *RecordsMatchPredicate* column while running the command in `whatif` mode:
```kusto
.delete materialized-view MyMaterializedView records with (whatif=true) <| MyMaterializedView | where UserId == 'X'
```
