User: I have a Python program that queries multiple remote services (MongoDB, MySQL, etc). Is there a way to track how much data my program is transferring over the network either within the Python program or through some Linux utility?
Assistant: In python, you'd probably have to wrap things - it could be a bit of a challenge.
In Linux, the netstat program will probably do something that's at least related to what you want.
