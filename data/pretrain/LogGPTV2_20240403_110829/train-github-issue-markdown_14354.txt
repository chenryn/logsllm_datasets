### Current Behavior
Using `vsce` in vscode extension workspace throws errors for missing
dependencies.
I have several VSCode extensions that am moving together in monorepo with npm
workspace.  
All the dependencies for the extensions are hoisted at the root node_modules.  
To prepare the vscode extension packages I use the `vsce` tool, that
internally uses:
    npm list --production --depth=99999 --loglevel=error
to collect all npm modules that need to be backed in the VSCode extension.  
The command is executed in the directory of each workspace, and fails with:
    npm ERR! missing: @aspnet/signalr@^1.1.4, required by blazortemplatewizard@1.2.1
    npm ERR! missing: @types/app-root-path@^1.2.4, required by blazortemplatewizard@1.2.1
    npm ERR! missing: @types/archiver@^2.1.3, required by blazortemplatewizard@1.2.1
however these are already installed in node_modules a few folders up.
### Expected Behavior
Using `vsce` in vscode extension workspace to pack correctly.
From what I understand it may need changes in that external `vsce` tool as
well, but first the `npm ls --production` will need to either change behaviour
to look in node_modules outside the current folder, or perhaps a new switch
like `--include-workspace-deps` to look modules up. I hope I am missing
something that could get this running.
### Steps To Reproduce
Create a project with few workspaces.  
Install the dependencies in at the root.  
cd into one of the workspaces.  
run `npm list`
It will generate errors for missing dependencies, that had been installed at
the root level.
I've prepared a small repo that shows the list failing if the deps are
installed at the root level, and how it works when the deps are installed
locally in each dependency:
