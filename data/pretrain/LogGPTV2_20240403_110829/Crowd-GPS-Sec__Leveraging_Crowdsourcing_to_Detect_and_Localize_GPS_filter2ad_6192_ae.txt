### Combined Error Effects

The localization accuracy of Crowd-GPS-Sec in identifying spoofers is influenced by three primary factors: GPS error, MLAT (Multilateration) error, and the velocity of the spoofed track. These parameters are integral to the relationships defined in Equation (7) and thus directly impact the overall accuracy. While MLAT noise has a relatively minor effect, GPS noise and the spoofed track velocity significantly affect the achievable accuracy. This is due to the small differences in the spoofed aircraft positions relative to the speed of light divided by the spoofed track velocity.

In general, the relationship between the localization error \( E \), the GPS noise \( \sigma_{\text{GPS}} \), and the spoofed track velocity \( v_{\text{track}} \) can be expressed as:
\[ E \propto \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sigma_{\text{GPS}}}{v_{\text{track}}} \]
(12)

Here, \( \sigma_{\text{GPS}} \) is scaled by \( \sqrt{2} \) because it is based on the Euclidean distance between two normally distributed points in space. Consequently, we can expect similar results for low track velocities with low GPS noise and high track velocities with high GPS noise.

### Localizing Spoofers of Stationary Targets

The attacker model considered in this paper assumes that the spoofer's target is a moving object. If the target is stationary, the attacker could spoof constant positions. While detection would still be possible, localization would fail because the differences in propagation delays between the spoofer and the aircraft would not be reflected in the reported position differences (compare \( d_{i,j} \) in Equation (9)).

One approach to address this issue is to propagate GPS time synchronization information to the ground infrastructure. As time progresses, the spoofer would need to imitate a progressing GPS time to remain undetected by the target. By having information about the time synchronization of affected aircraft, localization can be performed analogously. Specifically, if \( t \) denotes the real GPS time and \( \hat{t}_i \) the reported time of aircraft \( i \), the relation from Equation (7) can be rewritten as:
\[ \text{dist}(a_i, SP) - \text{dist}(a_j, SP) = (\hat{t}_i - \hat{t}_j) \cdot c \cdot \delta \]
(13)
where \( \delta \) represents a factor for the speed of the spoofed GPS clock. Equation (13) is independent of the spoofed position and thus allows for the localization of spoofers, even if the target is stationary.

### Applicability to Other Networks

The underlying concept of Crowd-GPS-Sec is not limited to aircraft but can also be applied to GPS spoofing attacks on cars, trucks, ships, or other ground vehicles. Similar to the broadcasting of avionic position reports via ADS-B or Flarm, vehicular systems could report state information to roadside units. The combined reports can then be used to implement our spoofing detection and localization scheme. Although the speeds of ground vehicles are generally lower, the density of affected targets is higher, and GPS filtering is expected to be more conditioned. Ultimately, we envision the integration of information from different networks, where each spoofed system, such as aircraft, vehicles, and vessels, can collaborate by sharing their information in a crowdsourcing manner.

### Related Work

GPS is known to be vulnerable to spoofing attacks [2], [5], [8], [31], and several works have demonstrated their feasibility [3], [4], [10], [32], [33]. These attacks can target various domains, including vehicle navigation systems [4], [10], [32] and critical infrastructures [6]. The requirements for successful GPS spoofing attacks are analyzed in [7], and attacks that alter the data content of the signals are discussed in [44]. It is worth noting that GPS spoofing has also been proposed as a countermeasure, for example, to defend against hostile UAVs [8], [11], [32] through hijacking or misguidance.

General techniques for detecting and localizing wireless spoofing attacks (not specific to GPS satellite signals) are proposed by Chen et al. [45]. They use received signal strength (RSS) readings from different locations and compare them against RSS maps built during an offline calibration phase to locate the spoofer. Their scheme was evaluated in 802.11 and 802.15.4 networks. Later, Yang et al. [46] extended the scheme to handle attackers that vary their transmission power, considering RSS differences at multiple locations.

A different class of detection approaches involves the use of multiple antennas. Tippenhauer et al. [7], [48] use multiple co-located GPS receivers to compare calculated positions and times; coinciding locations indicate an attack. A dual-antenna receiver setup to determine the angle of arrival of incoming signals is proposed by Montgomery et al. [20] and extended by Psiaki et al. [49] to include differential carrier phase measurements. Magiera and Katulski [21] suggest using arrays of antennas, showing that antenna diversity is effective at detecting single-antenna spoofers without knowledge of the target's position. Although these detection approaches do not require changes to the GPS infrastructure, they assume more sophisticated GPS receivers, which would increase complexity, size, costs, and power requirements, contradicting the objectives of GPS.

Techniques to detect spoofing attacks in ADS-B have been proposed by [23], [50]â€“[52]. However, these works consider spoofed ADS-B signals, not spoofed GPS signals, and are therefore not capable of localizing GPS spoofers as in Crowd-GPS-Sec.

### Conclusion

This work introduces Crowd-GPS-Sec, an independent system for detecting and localizing GPS spoofing attacks targeted at aircraft and UAVs. Crowd-GPS-Sec is lightweight and leverages existing wireless air traffic broadcast infrastructures, such as ADS-B and Flarm systems, to identify spoofing attacks from a remote location. We have shown that our approach is effective at localizing spoofing devices by using differences in reported positions from multiple aircraft. Using simulations based on real-world input from the OpenSky Network, we have demonstrated that Crowd-GPS-Sec achieves attack detection delays below two seconds and an attacker localization accuracy of around 150 meters after 15 minutes of monitoring time.
