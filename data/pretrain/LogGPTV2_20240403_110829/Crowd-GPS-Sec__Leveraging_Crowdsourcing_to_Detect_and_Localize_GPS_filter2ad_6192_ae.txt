Combined Error Effects. The spoofer localization accuracy
of Crowd-GPS-Sec depends on the GPS error, the MLAT
error, and the spoofed track velocity. These three parameters
are all components of the relations deﬁned in Equation (7)
and thus impact the accuracy. While the MLAT noise is less
decisive, the GPS noise and the spoofed track velocity are
signiﬁcantly affecting the achievable accuracy. This is due to
the small differences in spoofed aircraft positions with respect
to the speed of light divided by the spoofed track velocity.
In general, we expose the following relationship between the
localization error E, the GPS noise σGPS, and the spoofed
track velocity vtrack:
with σGPS being scaled with
2 due to the Euclidean distance
based on two normally distributed points in space. Hence, we

can expect to see similar results for low track velocities with
low GPS noise and high track velocities with high GPS noise.
Localizing Spoofers of Stationary Targets. The attacker
model considered in this paper assumes that the spoofer’s
target is a moving object. If instead the target is stationary,
the attacker could also spoof constant positions. While the
detection would still work, the localization would fail since the
differences in propagation delays between spoofer and aircraft
would not be reﬂected in the reported position differences
(compare di,j in Equation (9)). One way to cope with such at-
tackers is to additionally propagate GPS time synchronization
information to the ground infrastructure. As time is evolving,
the spoofer would have to imitate a progressing GPS time to
remain undetected by the target. Having information about
the time synchronization of affected aircraft would allow
performing a localization by analogy. More speciﬁcally, if t
denotes the real GPS time and ˆti the reported time of aircraft i,
the relation from Equation (7) can be rewritten to:
dist(ai, SP) − dist(aj, SP) = (ˆti − ˆtj) · c
δ
(13)
,
where δ denotes a factor representing the spoofed GPS clock’s
speed. Equation (13) is independent from the spoofed position
and therefore allows localizing spoofers, even if the target is
stationary.
Applicability to Other Networks. The underlying idea of
Crowd-GPS-Sec does not only apply to aircraft but can also
be relevant to GPS spooﬁng attacks on cars, trucks, ships,
or other vehicles on ground. Similar to the broadcasting
of avionic position reports via ADS-B or Flarm, vehicular
systems could also report state information to, e. g., roadside
units. The combined reports can then be used to run our
spooﬁng detection and localization scheme. Even though the
speeds of vehicles are comparably low, the density of affected
targets is much higher and the GPS ﬁltering is expected to
be more conditioned. Eventually, we envision the merging of
information provided by different networks. In particular, each
spoofed system, such as aircraft, vehicles, vessel, etc., can
collaborate by sharing their information in a crowdsourcing
manner.
VI. RELATED WORK
As GPS is known to be vulnerable to spooﬁng attacks [2],
[5], [8], [31], several works demonstrated their feasibility [3],
[4], [10], [32], [33]. Attacks can target different domains
such as vehicle navigation systems [4], [10], [32] or criti-
cal infrastructures [6]. The requirements for successful GPS
spooﬁng attacks are analyzed in [7]. Attacks that also change
the data content of the signals are discussed in [44]. It is
worth noting that GPS spooﬁng has also been proposed as
a countermeasure, e. g., to defend against hostile UAVs [8],
[11], [32] by means of hijacking or misguidance.
General techniques for detecting and localizing wireless
spooﬁng attacks (not speciﬁc to GPS satellite signals) are
proposed by Chen et al. [45]. The authors use received signal
strength (RSS) readings from different locations and compare
A rich body of countermeasures speciﬁc to GPS exists in the
literature which can be categorized into prevention and detec-
tion measures. In order to prevent spooﬁng of GPS signals,
several works propose the use of cryptographic techniques
to authenticate satellite signals [13]–[16]. This is similar to
how military GPS signals are protected. However, crypto-
graphic techniques require profound modiﬁcations of the GPS
infrastructure as well as a key distribution system which is
challenging to implement for applications with disconnected
receivers. Further, the use of encryption alone does not protect
against signal replaying attacks [33].
The detection of GPS spooﬁng attacks has also received
considerable attention in the literature. Overviews can be
found in [18] and [31]. Akos [19] suggests to monitor the
incoming signal power and the state of the automatic gain
control. Another technique called SPREE relies on auxiliary
peak tracking [17] to detect suspicious peaks from signals with
weaker acquisition correlation peaks. Psiaki et al. [47] propose
a detection scheme which uses an additional reference receiver
to correlate the received signal with authentic signals assuming
the inclusion of the encrypted military signal. A spoofed signal
does not correlate with the reference node’s received signal
and the attack can be detected.
them against RSS maps built during an ofﬂine calibration
phase to locate the spoofer. They evaluated their scheme in
802.11 and 802.15.4 networks. Later, Yang et al. [46] extended
the scheme to deal with attackers which vary their transmission
power. Rather than using direct RSS values, they consider RSS
differences at multiple locations.
A different class of detection approaches deploys multiple
antennas. Tippenhauer et al. [7], [48] use multiple co-located
GPS receivers whose calculated positions and times are com-
pared; coinciding locations indicate an attack. A dual antenna
receiver setup to determine the angle of arrival of incoming
signals is proposed by Montgomery et al. [20] and extended
by Psiaki et al. [49] to include differential carrier phase mea-
surements. Magiera and Katulski [21] suggest even the use of
arrays of antennas showing that antenna diversity is effective
at detecting single antenna spoofers without knowledge of the
target’s position. Although these detection approaches do not
require changes to the GPS infrastructure, they assume more
sophisticated GPS receivers which would signiﬁcantly increase
the complexity, size, costs, and power requirements. This,
however, is contradictory to the objectives of GPS. It is also
worth noting that, in principle, almost any passive localization
technique (such as multilateration) could be used to locate GPS
spoofers. However, in contrast to our approach, these methods
assume a direct line-of-sight between the localization system
and the attacker. As a consequence, this requires a dedicated
infrastructure which covers all potential attacker positions.
The authors of [23], [50]–[52] have proposed techniques to
detect spooﬁng attacks in ADS-B. However, the threat model
in these works is different as they consider spoofed ADS-B
signals and not spoofed GPS signals. These techniques are
therefore not capable of localizing GPS spoofers such as in
Crowd-GPS-Sec.

VII. CONCLUSION
This work presented Crowd-GPS-Sec, an independent sys-
tem to detect and localize GPS spooﬁng attacks targeted
at aircraft and UAVs. Crowd-GPS-Sec is lightweight and
leverages existing wireless air trafﬁc broadcast infrastructures,
the ADS-B and Flarm systems, to identify spooﬁng attacks
from a remote location—possibly far from where the attack
is happening. We have shown that our approach is effective
at localizing spooﬁng devices by using differences in reported
positions by multiple aircraft. Using simulations based on real-
world input from the OpenSky Network, we have demon-
strated that Crowd-GPS-Sec achieves attack detection delays
below two seconds and an attacker localization accuracy of
around 150 meters after 15 minutes of monitoring time.
