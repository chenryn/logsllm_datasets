User: I am a new PyCharm user who switched from Wing.
In Wing, if I configure Wing to use the "Python3" interpreter, the console would also run Python3. However, in PyCharm Community Version, even if I configure the project to use the Python 3.4 interpreter, the console would still use 2.7.5. (The program runs properly with Python 3.4) Is there a way that I can use the console with Python3.
Platform: Mac OS X 10.7.5
Python 2.7.5 and 3.4 installed.
Thanks!
Assistant: When you go to Settings > Console > Python Console you can choose the standard interpreter for your console.
The standard there is the chosen Project Interpreter you select under Settings > Project Interpreter. Don't forget to restart Pycharm. 
Or you can assign a different interpreter to each project. Go to Settings > Project:myproject > Project Interpreter.
