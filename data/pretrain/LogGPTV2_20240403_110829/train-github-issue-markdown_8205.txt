# Description
Because of usage of `realpath` in
`Symfony\Bridge\Doctrine\DependencyInjection\AbstractDoctrineExtension`,
entities from Phar-packages can't be loaded.
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Pack whole the framework with entities in Phar-package or just pack only own code into Phar.
  2. Try to clear the cache or somehow use the entities-related features.
  3. Say "hello" to `Doctrine\Common\Persistence\MappingException` with message `File mapping drivers must have a valid directory path, however the given path seems to be incorrect!`
