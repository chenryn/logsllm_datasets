User: I have a problem where my PYTHONPATH variable always has a blank value. I can fix it temporarily like this:
export PYTHONPATH=$(python -c 'import sys;print ":".join(sys.path)')
but is there a more permanent way to do this?
Assistant: put the path setting in /etc/profile, it will impact to all users. 
put the path in your home directory ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/kshrc (depand on your shell).
