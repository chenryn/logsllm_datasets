**Current Behavior:**
Upon transitioning to Angular 4, it appears that the documentation for the `AbstractControl` class is missing some functions.

**Expected Behavior:**
The `AbstractControl` documentation should be comprehensive and match the details provided in the Angular 2 documentation available at:
- [Angular 2 AbstractControl Documentation](https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-class.html)

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Compare the current Angular 4 `AbstractControl` documentation:
   - [Angular 4 AbstractControl Documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-class.html)
2. With the source code in the Angular repository:
   - [Angular 4 AbstractControl Source Code](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4.0.0/packages/forms/src/model.ts)

**Angular Version:**
- 4.0
