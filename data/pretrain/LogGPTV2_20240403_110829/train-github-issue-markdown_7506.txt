**Current behavior**  
In the transition to Angular 4, AbstractControl documentation seems to be
missing some functions.
**Expected behavior**  
The documentation should match with
https://v2.angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-
class.html
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
Compare https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/forms/index/AbstractControl-
class.html with
https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/4.0.0/packages/forms/src/model.ts
  * **Angular version:** 4.0
