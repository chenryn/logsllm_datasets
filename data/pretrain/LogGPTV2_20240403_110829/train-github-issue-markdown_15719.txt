Hello,
There's a bunch of packages which I'm installing that requires NumPy (for
example TensorFlow), and I can't seem to be able to install and import them
because of an ImportError on the numpy side.
This is happening with both `pip install` and building from source.
### Reproducing code example:
    import numpy as np
    import tensorflow as tf
### Error message:
    ImportError: numpy.core._multiarray_umath failed to import
### Numpy/Python version information:
    '1.16.0.dev0+cdbf35b'
