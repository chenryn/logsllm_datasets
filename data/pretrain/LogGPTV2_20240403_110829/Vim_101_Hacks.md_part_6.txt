• Press > to move the block right, and  or  >gv
Once you’ve remapped the  as shown above, after you indent, the
block will be still selected. This way, you can keep indenting the block as
many time you would like and finally press  to get out of visual mode.
Vim will do the following types of indentations depending on the settings:
• Autoindent: When you create a new line, it copies indentation from
the current line.
• Smartindent: Similar to autoindent, but increases / reduces
indentation when you have { / }.
• Cindent: Enables automatic C program indenting.

Hack 45. Access Unix Man page for Functions from
Vim
From the Vim editor, press K on the word for which you want to read the man
page.
K
To access another section man page give {n}K. For example, to access the 2nd
section of the man page, do the following.
2K
Example: Sleep is a command, as well as library routine. So from a C program
if you attempt to view this man page, then you need to use 3K
Customize Man page Lookup (For example, Change to Perldoc)
To look up things other than Unix man pages, specify a different keywordprg.
For example, if you are a Perl programmer, you will be using the perldoc
command often for reading information about a function. So, set the
following in Vim editor.
:set keywordprg=perldoc\ -f
After the above setting, when you press K on a function name it will open the
perldoc instead of the Unix man page.

E325: ATTENTION
Found a swap file by the name ".file1.c.swp"
(1) Another program may be editing the same file.
If this is the case, be careful not to end up with two
different instances of the same file when making
changes.
Quit, or continue with caution.
(2) An edit session for this file crashed.
If this is the case, use ":recover" or "vim -r file1.c"
to recover the changes (see ":help recovery").
If you did this already, delete the swap file
".file1.c.swp" to avoid this message.
Swap file ".file1.c.swp" already exists!
[O]pen Read-Only, (E)dit anyway, (R)ecover, (Q)uit,

You will normally only see the above message for one of the following
reasons:
• Someone else is editing the file currently
• A previous edit session crashed.
Based on why this happened do one of the following as prompted by Vim:
• Open Read Only (viewing the content of the file)
• Edit anyway (editing the content of the file)
• Recover (replacing the content of the file with the content of the
swap file)
• Quit or Abort
