## Abstract
We introduce Iris, a practical and authenticated file system designed to support large enterprise workloads in the cloud while providing robust integrity guarantees against potentially untrustworthy service providers. As a transparent layer, Iris ensures strong data integrity, freshness, and retrievability, even in the event of accidental or adversarial cloud failures.

Iris is scalable to handle operations from hundreds or thousands of clients in parallel. It incorporates new optimization and caching techniques to mitigate the high network latency typically associated with cloud storage. Additionally, Iris introduces novel erasure coding techniques for the first efficient construction of a dynamic Proof of Retrievability (PoR) protocol over the entire file system.

Our experimental results on a prototype version of Iris demonstrate an end-to-end throughput of up to 260 MB per second for 100 clients issuing simultaneous requests, limited by available network bandwidth and hard drive throughput. We show that strong integrity protection in the cloud can be achieved with minimal performance degradation.

## Introduction
Organizations adopting cloud computing often outsource significant amounts of data and workloads to external cloud providers, attracted by cost savings, lower management overhead, and rapid scalability. However, this comes at the cost of reduced control over the infrastructure that houses their data and computing resources.

In current cloud storage systems, tenants can only discover data corruption or loss if the service provider reports it, or if a system failure occurs. This gap in integrity measurement poses business risks and complicates regulatory compliance.

Iris is a cloud-oriented, authenticated file system that provides efficient, comprehensive, and real-time data integrity verification. It enables enterprise tenants or auditors to verify the integrity and freshness of data retrieved from the file system during typical operations. Data integrity ensures that data has not been altered or corrupted, while freshness ensures that the latest version of the data is always retrieved, preventing rollback attacks. Tenants can also regularly audit the cloud provider and obtain continuous guarantees about the correctness and availability of the entire file system.

### Motivating Scenario
We envision a scenario where a large enterprise migrates its internal distributed file system to a cloud storage service. The key requirement is that enterprise users (clients) perform the same file system operations as they do locally, without modifying applications running on user machines. The slowdown in operation latency should be minimal, even when a large number of clients (hundreds or thousands) issue operations in parallel.

### Design Goals
Iris aims to seamlessly support the outsourcing of enterprise-class file systems to the cloud with minimal performance degradation. The design goals are:

- **Efficiency**: Achieve throughputs close to those of local file systems under concurrent operations from many clients, with minimal latency overhead.
- **Scalability**: Scale to large enterprise file systems with varying workloads and performance requirements, supporting multiple clients issuing operations in parallel.
- **Transparency**: Ensure compatibility with existing file system interfaces to facilitate seamless migration to the cloud.
- **Strong Integrity Protection**: Provide both authenticity and freshness for data and file system metadata, enabling continuous verification with minimal bandwidth and computation.

### Contributions of Iris
The key technical contributions and novel elements of Iris include:

- **Authenticated File System Design**: Iris provides data integrity and freshness for an enterprise-class file system efficiently. It uses a balanced Merkle-tree data structure to authenticate both file system data and metadata blocks. The design supports updates from multiple clients in parallel and handles all existing file system operations with minimal overhead. Iris also implements optimizations for typical workloads and overcomes the economic barrier of high network latency by implementing novel caching techniques within the enterprise trust boundary.

- **Continuous Auditing of File System Correctness (PoR)**: Iris provides the first dynamic Proof of Retrievability (PoR) protocol, enabling tenants to continuously monitor the cloud storage service and obtain strong guarantees about the correctness and availability of the entire file system. The protocol uses a sparse randomized erasure code to hide the parity structure and be resilient against adversarial clouds, allowing for recovery when corruptions are detected.

- **End-to-End Design and Implementation**: Iris is fully implemented with 25,000 lines of code. Performance evaluations show that the caching mechanism effectively achieves low latency for file system operations, similar to LAN latencies. Iris achieves high throughput (up to 260 MB/s for 100 clients in a local testbed), with the bottleneck being network bandwidth and hard drive throughput. The overall cost of adding strong integrity protection is minimal.

## Related Work
### File Systems with Integrity Support
Early cryptographic file systems focused on protecting data confidentiality and integrity in local storage. Later, systems like TCFS and SNAD provided data integrity by storing hashes for each file block. Many systems use Merkle trees to authenticate file blocks more efficiently, but few provide both data and metadata freshness. Systems like SFSRO and Cepheus build Merkle trees over the file system directory tree, but result in unbalanced structures. Athos constructs a balanced data structure but lacks efficient support for some file system operations. FARSITE uses a distributed directory group to maintain metadata information, ensuring freshness when more than two-thirds of the group members are correct.

### PoRs/PDPs
Proofs of Retrievability (PoR) and Proofs of Data Possession (PDP) are challenge-response protocols that allow cloud providers to demonstrate data retrievability and detect corruption. Most existing PDP and PoR protocols are designed for static data. Dynamic PDP protocols have been proposed, but they do not efficiently support typical file system operations. Iris provides the first efficient dynamic PoR protocol for the entire file system.

## System Model and Overview
Iris is designed as an enterprise file system using back-end cloud storage. Clients issue file system operations intermediated by Iris and relayed to the public cloud. Heavy caching on the enterprise side is necessary to mitigate the high cost of network transfer and reduce individual operation latency.
