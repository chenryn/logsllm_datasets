### Figure 13: Boxplots of Different Inference Approaches

Figure 13 presents the boxplots for various inference methods across different levels. At level 1, the error rates are consistent with those observed in the two-level tree settings of Experiment B.1, with an average error rate of approximately 5%. In levels 2 and 3, the number of packet samples is reduced, leading to higher error rates compared to level 1. 

Overall, both `est.equal` and `est.self` outperform `est.perfect`, with this improvement being more pronounced in levels 2 and 3. Notably, in level 3, the error rate for `est.perfect` approaches nearly 100%, as it frequently reports 0% loss estimates.

In levels 1 and 2, `est.equal` has a slightly higher error rate than `est.self`. However, in level 3, `est.self` exhibits a very high error rate. This can be attributed to the fact that packet losses are generated only at the links of interest, resulting in varying end-to-end loss rates across different root-to-leaf paths. Consequently, TCP flows along more lossy paths experience more timeouts, leading to uneven traffic loads. This makes `est.self` less robust, as seen in the two-level tree settings. Conversely, `est.equal` maintains the lowest error rates (generally within 20%) among all methods in level 3.

### Figure 14: Results for Uniform Loss Rates Across All Links

Figure 14 shows the results for a scenario where packet losses are generated at all links in the topology, with an approximate loss rate of 2%. In this case, `est.equal` and `est.self` exhibit similar error rates, as each link has a comparable loss rate and the traffic loads are balanced. Both methods significantly outperform `est.perfect` in levels 2 and 3.

### Summary

We compare different inference approaches using network simulations. Similar to our model simulations (Section VI), our PL-based inference outperforms the inference that assumes perfect correlation. By using the same end-to-end loss rates, our PL-based inference remains robust to uneven traffic loads in different end-to-end paths. We also demonstrate that our PL-based inference is feasible in large-scale topologies.

### VIII. Related Work

Loss rate inference was first addressed in multicast settings [4], [9], [23], where a source dispatches multicast probes, and multiple receivers measure the end-to-end loss rates. Statistical techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation [9], [23] and temporal estimation [4] are then applied to infer internal losses. These methods focus on a single tree, while [7] considers a multi-tree setting. Given the limited deployment of IP multicast, unicast-based loss rate inference methods were proposed in [11], [12], [16], which involve sending unicast probing packets to different receivers to infer losses. The main assumption is that unicast probes are temporally correlated on common links. A more robust unicast-based inference approach was later introduced in [20], which leverages the variance of loss rates of unicast probes.

These methods rely on active probing, which introduces additional traffic overhead. Passive measurement techniques have been proposed [6], [21], [22] to infer losses through existing network traffic. While [6] and [21] focus on identifying lossy links, [22] is closely related to our work as it uses the time correlation of existing TCP traffic for loss rate inference. However, a key distinction is that our work explicitly models time correlation in loss estimates, whereas [22] does not.

Recent research directions include practical implementations of inference tools (e.g., [15]). Various studies also consider delay and topology inferences, with a survey of these studies found in [10].

### IX. Conclusions

In network tomography, passive measurements are more attractive than active measurements because they introduce no probing overhead. This paper presents a new approach for inferring link loss rates that is adaptive to different forms of time correlation when passive measurements are assumed. We develop a loss model as a function of time correlation and address its identifiability. We then apply the concept of profile likelihood in a novel way for passive network tomography to accurately infer link loss rates in complex topologies. Using extensive model and network simulations, we show that our approach provides high inference accuracy under different network settings.

### Appendix

#### A. Proof of Theorem 2

From (9), we have:
\[
\hat{p} - p = \frac{(M_{10} + M_{11})(M_{01} + M_{11}) - pM_{11}N}{M_{11}N},
\]
where the numerator can be simplified to:
\[
M_{10}M_{01} + (N - M_{00})M_{11} - pM_{11}N.
\]

Our proof is based on the law of large numbers. Recall that the time difference between packet pairs is assumed constant. Using the same notation as in (4) and (5), and ignoring the time dependence since it is constant, we can show:
\[
E(M_{10}M_{01}) = N(N - 1)r_{10}r_{01},
\]
since the same packet pair cannot have different success states, and only different pairs contribute to the above. Similarly:
\[
E(M_{00}M_{11}) = N(N - 1)r_{00}r_{11},
\]
and it is clear that \(E(M_{11}N) = N^2 r_{11}\). Substituting the right side of the above three equations and asymptotically ignoring the difference between \(N^2\) and \(N(N - 1)\), we can express (23) for large \(N\) as:
\[
N^2(r_{10}r_{01} - r_{00}r_{11} + (1 - p)r_{11}).
\]
Therefore, the asymptotic bias is:
\[
\hat{p} - p = \frac{r_{10}r_{01} - r_{00}r_{11} + (1 - p)r_{11}}{r_{11}} = \frac{p^2 p_1 p_2 - pr_{11}}{r_{11}},
\]
where the second relation can be easily derived from (5). Hence, the result of (10).
