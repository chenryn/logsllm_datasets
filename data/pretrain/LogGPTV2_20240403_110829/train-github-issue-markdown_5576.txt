 **Description**
Since v2.8.46, relative dates are not supported anymore by `DateTimeType`.
I am guessing this is because of the patches :
  * bug #28466 [Form] fail reverse transforming invalid RFC 3339 dates
  * bug #28372 [Form] Fix DateTimeType html5 input format
It would be great to introduce the feature again by adding a dedicated value
of the `format` option, or anything better you can think of.
**Example**
At @lrqdo, the relative dates are helping us simplify our Behat scenarios.
Here is an example of a Behat scenario failing on v2.8.46:
    When I send a POST request to "/endpoint" with values:
      | distributionDate | +14 days |
    Then the response code should be 200
      Failed asserting that 400 is identical to 200.
Here is the form type we wrote:
    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)
    {
        $builder->add(
            'distributionDate',
            DateTimeType::class,
            array(
                'widget' => 'single_text',
            )
        );
    }
And here is the detailed error we get:
