User: I do not know Python, I have installed it only and downloaded the libgmail package. So, please give me verbatim steps in installing the libgmail library. My python directory is c:\python26, so please do not skip any steps in the answer.
Thanks!
Assistant: Extract the archive to a temporary directory, and type "python setup.py install".
