User: How to design a secure network architecture and firewall strategy to ensure network security and privacy?
Assistant: 1. Determine the network architecture: A multi-layered network architecture should be adopted, including edge networks, core networks, and security areas. The edge network is connected to the Internet, the core network is used for internal network data transmission, and the security zone can be used to manage key information and sensitive data. 2. Manage users: Users should be assigned appropriate permissions and access corresponding resources as needed. For example, only authorized employees can access critical information. 3. Manage security vulnerabilities: regularly conduct vulnerability scanning and security testing to discover and deal with new security vulnerabilities. 4. Encrypted data transfers: All network communications should be encrypted, including remote access and internal data transfers. 5. Control network access: Network access should be comprehensively audited, and external access should be restricted, such as using a secure batch interface (API) and other security tools to curb unauthorized intrusion and access. 6. Use a firewall: Place a firewall between the edge network and the core network to prevent unauthorized access. You should also regularly update your firewall rules and use a variety of security technologies to protect against phishing, malware, and other cyberattacks. 7. Raise employee awareness: Carry out network security publicity training and awareness education for employees to truly increase employees' awareness of network security and privacy protection, thereby reducing the threat of human factors to the network.
