  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
I uploaded my Next.js/Express app on AWS and it's failing at runtime for
unknown reason.
I have the following AWS logs:
    START RequestId: 27f88393-2541-11e8-af21-a362290178d9 Version: $LATEST

What I could deduce from those logs is that a request is handled at
http://staging.loan-advisor.studylink.fr/ by Express and then a new request
from http://staging.loan-
advisor.studylink.fr/_next/fa74e99a-3209-47d0-b35e-096852884958/page/_error.js
is handled.
Next loads correctly IMHO, since it's able to load the http://staging.loan-
advisor.studylink.fr/_next/fa74e99a-3209-47d0-b35e-096852884958/page/_error.js
script, which, I guess, displays a 404?
So, something is wrong when Next.js app tries to display something initially,
but I have nothing to help me debug the issue ðŸ˜•
Locally, everything works correctly, but I'm concerned about the lack of logs
in the AWS environment, which makes it super hard to debug anything.
I did force `quiet: false` when instanciating my Next.js app but it doesn't
have any effect.

Edit: I made a simple debug page at https://staging.loan-
advisor.studylink.fr/debug which works fine and gets rendered correctly, so my
first assumption is right, an exception happens in the index page which leads
to throwing a 404 somehow. (instead of a 500 :/)
