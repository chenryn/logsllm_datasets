# Environment
    Windows build number: 1909 (18363.836)
    PowerToys version: 0.18.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): Powertoys Run
# Steps to reproduce
Alt+Space  
Search for "Bildschirmtastatur" or "winver" for example
# Expected behavior
Bring up the on-screen keyboard or the windows version dialogue.
# Actual behavior
"Bildschirmtastatur" can't be found in PowerToysRun, only a search via the
start menu does.  
Although it can be found if the application already is running and has been
started via the start menu (see second screenshot)  
Also winver can only be started from the start menu, as typing winver in
PowerToysRun does only bring up system administrative tools.
