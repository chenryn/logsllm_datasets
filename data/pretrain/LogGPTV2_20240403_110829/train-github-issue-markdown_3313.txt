I've been checking values in Scipy's implementation of hyp1f1 against other
implementations and I noticed some discrepancies where Scipy's solution seems
to be off.
scipy.special.hyp1f1(a,b,c) vs M(a,b,c) from
(http://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1349143651).
In particular, take small values of a, b, and c, say a = 1, b = 5, and c =
0.01.
Both equal: 1.002003338101197 (with differences in the remaining digits)
However change a to 50 and b to 100. a = 50, b = 100, and c = 0.01.
scipy.special.hyp1f1(a,b,c) = 1774259915037.1118  
M(a,b,c) = 1.005012645242146341004
I've double checked on Matlab and the latter is correct. In general, higher
values of a and b give the scipy implementation greater trouble. This is using
scipy version 0.13.3. There was an earlier report similar in nature (#946)
which has since been closed.
