User: Write a Python script to extract all usernames and corresponding email addresses from a JSON file and write them into a CSV file.
Assistant: The following is a Python script that can achieve this function: ```python import json import csv # read JSON data with open('data.json', 'r') as f: data = json.load(f) # Extract the username and corresponding mailbox from the JSON data users = [] for user in data['users']: users.append([user['name'], user['email']]) # Write to CSV file with open('users.csv', 'w', newline='') as f: writer = csv.writer(f) writer.writerow(['Name', 'Email']) writer.writerows(users) ``` In the script above, we used the `json` and `csv` modules in the Python standard library to process JSON data and write to CSV files. First, we use the `json.load()` function to read the data from the JSON file and store it in the `data` variable. Next, we traverse the `data['users']` array, and take out the username and email address of each user and store them in the `users` list. Finally, we use the `csv.writer()` function from the Python standard library to write the data in the `users` list to the CSV file. We first create a CSV writer, then use the `writer.writerow()` function to write the header row first, and then use the `writer.writerows()` function to write all user data rows. Note that when we open the CSV file, we need to set the `newline` parameter to `''`, otherwise the written data will exist alternately.
