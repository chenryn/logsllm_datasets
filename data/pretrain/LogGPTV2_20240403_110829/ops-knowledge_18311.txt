User: So, as you may know there are certain apps on Windows that can be installed from the app store, and are classified as Windows Trusted Apps. I am not sure, but I think these do not use the classic .exe format. So I am writing a python script to automate some stuff when I start my pc, and I need to start a certain Windows App, but I don't know how to do this as I don't know what I need to start to do so, and I also do not know where these files are located. Anyone can help?
Assistant: You can use this new technique, its called winapps its used for searching, modifying, and uninstalling apps. Its download command on cmd windows is pip install winapps.
