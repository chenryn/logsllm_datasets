ABSTRACT
At ﬁrst glance, privacy and zero-knowledgeness seem to be
similar properties. A scheme is private when no information
is revealed on the prover and in a zero-knowledge scheme,
communications should not leak provers’ secrets.
Until recently, privacy threats were only partially formal-
ized and some zero-knowledge (ZK) schemes have been pro-
posed so far to ensure privacy. We here explain why the
intended goal is not reached. Following the privacy model
proposed by Vaudenay at Asiacrypt 2007, we reconsider the
analysis of these schemes. We ﬁrstly propose a framework
which enables to transform some generic ZK scheme into
private scheme. We then apply as a relevant example this
framework to the GPS scheme. This leads to eﬃcient imple-
mentations of zero-knowledge identiﬁcation schemes which
respect privacy. Their security and their privacy are based
on the problem of the Short Exponent Decisional Diﬃe-
Hellman problem.

INTRODUCTION
Contactless communications are used in many contexts:
public transportation cards, electronic wallets or electronic
passports. As these communications are based on radio fre-
quency technology, it is often very simple to eavesdrop com-
munications and even to impersonate a veriﬁer. This doing,
an adversary could either get personal information or track
someone at range.
Examples of contactless devices (CLDs) are deﬁned in the
ISO/IEC 14443-3 standard [13]. To authenticate a CLD and
to set up a session key, which further encrypts communica-
tions between devices and veriﬁers, an identiﬁcation scheme
is needed. Many such schemes have been proposed so far,
either based on symmetric cryptography [1, 5, 17, 27, 29,
45] or asymmetric cryptography [8, 9, 12, 31, 33, 36].
The ﬁrst class of schemes have been developed in order
to ensure privacy of the device’s owner. Their main draw-
back is that they are not scalable. In general, the veriﬁer
has to search amongst all the authorized devices’ identity
and to determine whether one identity is the one which is
searched. Thus, if the number of possible devices increases,
the computations needed by the veriﬁer also increase. An-
other drawback is the necessity to securely store the identi-
ties.
The second class of schemes based on asymmetric cryptog-
raphy ensures secure authentication thanks to well-known
mathematical problems. They can be easily transformed
into scalable schemes. In the context of identiﬁcation sche-
mes, one of their advantages is that the list of valid identities
is not necessarily secretly stored. Indeed, if computing a se-
cret key from an identity is hard, this list does not reveal
any secret needed to be authenticated. However, we here
prove that many of theses schemes need modiﬁcations in
order to ensure privacy. We then propose general modiﬁ-
cations of zero-knowledge schemes in order to achieve the
wanted properties of privacy, authenticity and scalability.
Among the few existing privacy models for identiﬁcation
protocols – Juels and Weis [18], Burmenster, van Le and
de Medeiros [21] and Vaudenay [43] – we choose to work
with Vaudenay’s model as it is more general. Thereafter,
195we prove the soundness and the privacy of our new schemes
by further adapting this model to take into account zero-
knowledge speciﬁcities. We introduce also the notions of
public or hidden-identity privacy.
The ﬁeld of identity documents is an interesting applica-
tion for this notion. In order to prove the authenticity of
the document, a proof of knowledge of a secret related to
an identity written on this document is made. This identity
can be read and thus cannot be considered as private. As a
matter of fact, these public identities written on these doc-
uments are very frequently copied in order to keep traces of
the owner, for instance in hotels or duty free area.
Our goal is to obtain schemes where an eavesdropper can-
not determine or trace documents (identities) by solely lis-
tening to the authentication procedure, even if he is aware
of all the documents identities. Note that a classical ZK
scheme cannot be private when the identities are public as
an identity is enough to verify the validity of a protocol ex-
ecution.
Finally we introduce eﬃcient public-identity private au-
thentication protocols to bring secure solutions to this very
application of ID documents.
1.1 Related Works
Zero-knowledge proofs have been introduced in [11] and
zero-knowledge identiﬁcation schemes in [4]. This kind of
scheme is very interesting as it enables to perform an inter-
active proof of knowledge of secrets without revealing any in-
formation on them. Many identiﬁcation schemes have been
developed so far and they are now envisaged in the context
of travel documents. For instance, GPS [9] and GQ [12]
protocols have been proposed as identiﬁcation schemes for
passports in [28]. However, we remark that such schemes do
not respect privacy. In fact, this is not surprising since these
protocols are not aimed at keeping the language secrets.
One idea in our propositions to ﬁx this problem is to
rely on veriﬁers’ public keys in order to ensure the pri-
vacy of provers’ outputs. Therefore the veriﬁer is able to
verify the authenticity of provers thanks to his private key.
Designated-Veriﬁer Signature (DVS) schemes have been in-
troduced in [16] and introduce a similar idea.
In a DVS
scheme, a veriﬁer which possesses a designated signature
cannot prove that this signature has been made by the signer.
The designated veriﬁer is in fact able to compute a signature
indistinguishable from the signer’s ones.
Some DVS schemes can be transformed into identiﬁcation
schemes. DVS schemes with the property that given the
public keys of the signer and the veriﬁer, one can verify
the signature, are called publicly veriﬁable (e.g.
[16, 22,
38]). Such publicly veriﬁable DVS schemes do not respect
privacy as they allow everybody to identify the prover during
the identiﬁcation process. DVS schemes where one needs
either the secret keys of the signer or the veriﬁer to verify a
signature are called privately veriﬁable (e.g. [35, 20]). Note
that for [35, 20], as underlined by [22], given the secret of
the signer, it is possible to determine whether he signs the
message or not. Our goal is to obtain constructions which
remain private even after compromise of prover’s secrets.
Jakobsson and Pointcheval proposed in [14] (see also Ap-
pendix B) a mutual authentication scheme for devices with
small power computation which shares some similarities with
our work. For further results about this scheme, see [15, 46,
47]. For identiﬁcation purpose, the scalability of these sche-
mes is not clear. We here introduce new scheme proposals
to achieve both privacy and scalability at the same time.
1.2 Outlines
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes a
privacy leakage which can be generalized to many ZK sche-
mes and analyzes these schemes. Section 3 recalls the Vaude-
nay’s model and introduces our modiﬁcations to adapt this
model to ZK schemes. Section 4 presents a generic technique
to increase the privacy of ZK schemes. Section 5 describes
an application of the results of section 4 to GPS identiﬁca-
tion protocol, and emphasizes eﬃcient implementations of
these constructions. Section 6 concludes.
2. ZERO-KNOWLEDGE SCHEMES
A lot of ZK identiﬁcation schemes have been developed,
but as we show below some of these schemes do not respect
privacy.
2.1 Motivations: Most Zero-Knowledge Sche-
mes does not respect privacy
In a context where identiﬁcations are made thanks to
Contact-Less Devices (CLD), it is natural to consider that
an adversary is able to record any communications emanat-
ing from CLDs.
If classical zero-knowledge protocols are
used and if an eavesdropper has a list of valid identities, he
is able to distinguish diﬀerent identities using his record, in
the same way as a honest veriﬁer does. Therefore, it seems
necessary to hide identities in order to enhance the privacy
level. In the sequel, we explain why many ZK schemes do
not respect privacy, even when the underlying identities are
hidden.
We assume a prover P wants to prove his possession of
the secret s related to his identity I = gs using the Schnorr
identiﬁcation scheme in Fig. 1. Any eavesdropper can record
gr1 , c, y1 = r1 + sc as showed in Fig.1. Therefore, he will be
able to compute gy1 g−r1 = gsc = I c.
If another prover
P (cid:48) tries to identify himself, the eavesdropper will get I(cid:48)c(cid:48)
.
Computing (I c)c(cid:48)
)c, the eavesdropper has a way to
distinguish whether the two provers have the same identity
or not, even if the group structure does not allow to compute
the map x (cid:55)→ x

Figure 1: Schnorr identiﬁcation scheme
retrieves enough information to distinguish the identity of
one prover. Here, we focused on the Schnorr scheme but the
same remark still holds for any identiﬁcation schemes where
an algebraic relation is needed to prove the knowledge of the
secret. Therefore, protocols such as GPS, Fiat-Shamir, GQ
share the same drawback. This privacy leakage is also work-
ing for generalization of these schemes, such as GQ2 [33],
196Ong-Schnorr [31], Okamoto [30], a generalization of Fiat-
Shamir [26]. Note that sometimes more than one protocol
execution may be required to distinguish identities.
2.2 Generic Description
Among the diﬀerent classes of identiﬁcation protocol (ZK
or closely related), Fiat-Shamir-like as [4, 6, 12, 26, 31, 33],
Schnorr-like as [8, 9, 30, 36], Syndrome-Decoding-like [39,
40, 44] or others (e.g. [4, 32, 37, 41]), we restrict ourselves
to those based on arithmetic relations. We formalize such
schemes as follows. Let P be a three-move identiﬁcation
protocol between a prover and a veriﬁer. Let us denote
[A, c, B] a transcript of P with A, B sent by the prover and
c by the veriﬁer after reception of A following Fig. 2. The
protocol is made of several algorithms:
• SetupAuthority(1k) (cid:55)→ (KAs, KAp): a polynomial
algorithm which outputs a private/public key pair of
an authority. KAp also deﬁnes the underlying group
structure.
• SetupProverKAp (1k) (cid:55)→ (s, I): a polynomial algo-
rithm which outputs a private/public key pair of a
prover. s is the secret linked to the identity I of the
prover thanks to a one-way function Id: Id(s) = I.
• ComputeAs,KAp () (cid:55)→ (A, rA): computes A thanks to
a random value rA.
• ComputeBs,KAp (rA, c) (cid:55)→ B: computes B.
• Verify(I, [A, c, B]) (cid:55)→ x ∈ {0, 1}: a function that
checks whether the veriﬁer identiﬁes the prover with
I.
As described in Fig. 2, this last algorithm Verify checks if
the following equation holds:
f (B) = A.gI (c)
(1)
where f and gI are two deterministic functions that depend
on KAp (note that the identity I of the prover is needed to
compute gI ). In the sequel of the paper, we assume that gI
is an exponentiation in base I.
