Table 4: As discussed in Section 4, we performed seven pairwise comparisons of conditions to investigate targeted hypotheses
about the impact of different visualizations. Here, we report the significant results of the associated Mann-Whitney U tests in
each cell. The leftmost column reports the omnibus Kruskal-Wallis tests.
