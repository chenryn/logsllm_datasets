Figure 6: Simulation results supporting the theoretical analysis (error level by varying Np)
hash functions used for each Bloom (cid:12)lter, and s = kp
is the computational complexity per packet. We assume
every router uses the same values of s and p for evalu-
ation purpose. For the purpose of simulations, we also
assume all the intermediate routers do the marking and
store the packet digests.
5.2. Veri(cid:12)cation of theoretical analysis
In Section 4, we have developed an information-
theoretic framework for optimal parameter tuning. In
particular, we predict that when the resource con-
straint is s = 0:4, the traceback accuracy is maximized
when k = 11 or 12 if there are 1,000 attackers with
same intensity. We conduct simulations on all topolo-
gies to verify the accuracy of our model, and the results
are shown in Figures 4(a,b,c). Here the number of at-
tackers Na is 1,000. We use the sum of FNR and FPR
to represent the overall error level of the simulation re-
sults, since the entropy concept re(cid:13)ects both FNR and
FPR11. The three curves correspond to using 50,000,
75,000 and 100,000 attack packets for traceback, re-
spectively. These (cid:12)gures show that the optimal value
11 The error pe does not correspond exactly to FNR + FPR, but is
close to FNR + FPR when both numbers are reasonably small.
of k parameter in our simulation is either 11 or 12,
matching our theoretical prediction perfectly. For ex-
ample, when we use 12 hash functions in a Bloom (cid:12)lter
and use 100,000 attack packets for traceback on Skit-
ter I topology, we can get 0.308 and 0.027 as FNR and
FPR respectively. It means that we can correctly iden-
tify around 70% of infected routers in attack tree with
only 2.7% of false positive. Note that this result is ob-
tained using very low resource constraint s = 0:4 which
makes the sampling rate as low as 3.3%.
We also simulate, given a (cid:12)xed k value, how the
error rate varies with di(cid:11)erent s values, and the re-
sults are shown in Figures 5(a,b,c). Here the number
of attackers Na is set to 2,000 and the number of at-
tack packets used for traceback is 200,000. The nine
curves in each (cid:12)gure represent the error rates when k
is set to 8; 9; (cid:1) (cid:1) (cid:1) , and 16, respectively. Among di(cid:11)er-
ent k values, our traceback scheme performs best with
k = 12 when the resource constraint s is no more than
0.6. For example, when k = 12 and s = 0:6, we get
0.009 and 0.061 as FNR and FPR respectively. When
there are more resources (i.e., s > 0:6), our traceback
scheme performs better with larger k values. The in-
terpretation of this is that our \one-packet decoding
rule" generates more false positives when larger s al-
lows for higher sampling rate and hence larger jLR1j

Figure 8: False Positive Ratio of our traceback scheme on three di(cid:11)erent topologies
(number of attack packets that match the Bloom (cid:12)lter
at R1). Since FNR at this point is already low, the in-
crease on the FPR will wipe out the gain we have on
FNR. In other words, at this point, the larger jLR1j be-
comes a liability rather than an asset. Therefore, when
s > 0:6, our scheme achieves lower (FNR + FPR),
when k is increased to reduce the false positive rate of
the Bloom (cid:12)lter and the size of LR1 .
We also would like to compare the minimum number
of packets needed to achieve a certain level of traceback
accuracy with the theoretical lower bound we have es-
tablished in Section 4.3.3. This can be achieved by com-
paring the curves in Figures 6(a,b,c) and curves in Fig-
ure 3 (in Section 4.3.3). The parameter settings used
in all (cid:12)gures are the same. All three curves in each (cid:12)g-
ure of Figures 6(a,b,c) are higher than curves in Fig-
ure 3. In other words, the required number of pack-
ets to achieve a certain error rate in the simulation
is higher than the number from the theoretical analy-
sis. This is expected for the following reason. The er-
ror pe in the theoretical context is di(cid:11)erent from (FNR
+ FPR). In the theoretical context, the error pe cor-
responds to the decoding error when R1 is correctly
convicted and only R2 is in question. In the (FNR +
FNR) measure, however, even R1 may not have been
correctly convicted. Therefore, (FNR + FPR) values
are always higher than pe values under the same at-
tack scenario. Note that curves in Figures 6(a,b,c) cor-
responding to 1,000 and 2,000 attackers go up when a
large number of attack packets are used for traceback.
Our explanation is that when Np becomes larger, there
are more false positives due to the \one-packet decod-
ing rule". In this case, the decrease in FNR is moder-
ate and outweighed by the increase in FPR.
5.3. Performance of our scheme
We would like to investigate how our traceback
scheme performs in terms of FPR and FNR with re-
spect to di(cid:11)erent number of attackers and di(cid:11)erent
number of attack packets used for traceback. Fig-
ures 7(a,b,c) show the FNR of our scheme against the
number of attack packets Np used for traceback, un-
der the three aforementioned Internet topologies. Sim-
ilarly, Figures 8(a,b,c) show the FPR values. In all six
