User: How to monitor application logs? How do I troubleshoot common application failures? Please provide corresponding tools and methods.
Assistant: The following methods can be used to monitor the logs of the application: 1. Terminal output: When running on the terminal of the application, you can view the log output information in real time on the terminal. This approach can be used in the development and testing phases. 2. Log files: Output logs to files in the application, which can be used to track application behavior and troubleshoot. 3. Log service: use professional log service for log monitoring and analysis. For example, Rizhiyi and Splunk etc. Common application failures include: 1. Memory exhaustion: The application consumes too many memory resources, resulting in memory exhaustion. 2. Network delay or disconnection: The application cannot communicate with its server or other components. 3. Code exception: The application's code has errors or references unavailable libraries or components. Troubleshooting common application failures can be done through the following methods: 1. Log analysis: Determine the location of the failure by analyzing the logs. 2. Application monitoring tools: For example, NewRelic, AppDynamics, Datadog, etc., which can be used to monitor application performance indicators, error messages, and failure data. 3. Application testing tools: For example, Selenium, JUnit, etc., which can be used to automate testing and find faults. 4. Timeline Analysis: Create a timeline to record each event to identify faults. This facilitates troubleshooting and troubleshooting on a time-based basis.
