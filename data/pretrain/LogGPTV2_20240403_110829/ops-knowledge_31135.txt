Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the template extraction:

### Log Line Template:
```
Connection request from old client /<IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT>; will be dropped if server is in read-only mode
```

### Explanation:
- `<IP_ADDRESS>`: Placeholder for the IP address (e.g., `10.10.34.35`).
- `<PORT>`: Placeholder for the port number (e.g., `47894`).

This template clearly identifies the structure of the log line, making it easier to understand and use.
