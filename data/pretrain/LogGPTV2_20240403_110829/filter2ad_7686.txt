## 1. Introduction
Named Data Networking (NDN) provides a pipeline mechanism where Interest packets perform flow control and sequencing functions similar to TCP ACK packets. Since NDN packets are independently named, the pipeline does not stall on a loss, and it inherently supports selective acknowledgments (SACK). NDN also offers a more sophisticated sequencing mechanism for requesting individual data chunks from large datasets, typically using version markers and segmentation markers in the chunk names.

The pipeline service in NDN is effective, but it comes at a high cost. For example, in Voice Over CCN (VoCCN), the data consumer must send more than 50 Interests per second, each of which is forwarded according to the Forwarding Information Base (FIB) and leaves traceable footprints on every router from the consumer to the provider. The high overhead is due to two main factors: time and space uncertainty in data transfer.

- **Time Uncertainty**: In applications like live video, data packets are generated at a high rate and must be transmitted quickly to ensure a good user experience. NDN frequently sends Interests to fetch data, which is inefficient. Additionally, the PIT (Pending Interest Table) entries have a limited lifetime, making it difficult to match the "rhythm" of sampling, leading to invalid PIT entries and complex application implementations. Extending the PIT entry lifetime can help but introduces security vulnerabilities.
  
- **Space Uncertainty**: In large file transfers, files are split into chunks of appropriate size to avoid high loss rates over best-effort services like 802.3/IP/UDP. The consumer must send corresponding Interest packets to retrieve the entire file.

In both cases, the network amplifies the overhead by the number of hops between the consumer and the producer, although caching can mitigate this. Reducing the number of Interest packets sent by the consumer can significantly lower the overhead.

Our solution is to aggregate multiple Interest packets from the same flow into a single packet, called an Interest Set packet. This approach maintains the pipeline with much lower overhead for a longer period. The PIT entry's lifetime timer is reset upon receiving any valid data packet, ensuring that the pipeline remains open until all data is returned.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Packet Description
An Interest Set packet contains multiple Interests in a single packet. These Interests must share the same name prefix. For example, different segments of a large file or different data samples from a live video conference. We use sequence numbers to represent the different parts, and the set contains a nonce to prevent looping, similar to regular Interest packets.

### 2.2 Node Model
NDN routers are updated to recognize Interest Set packets, create PIT entries, and reset the PIT entry's lifetime timer upon receiving valid data. The core functionality of the node model remains unchanged. The pseudocode for the node model can be found in our technical report [2].

The Set mechanism does not violate any NDN principles; it simply aggregates similar Interests into one packet and enhances NDN routers to construct a special pipeline. If no valid data is returned during the PIT entry's lifetime, the pipeline closes, and resources are recycled, potentially defending against attacks by sending massive amounts of Sets.

## 3. Evaluation & Simulation
We used ndnSIM [3] to evaluate the performance with a Point of Presence (PoP) topology of Sprint, which includes 52 nodes and 84 links with real weights. The provider is located at the center, and 8 consumers are on the edge. Other nodes request data to provide background traffic as needed. Each Set contains 32 sequence numbers, i.e., a cardinality of 32, based on the sample rate of real applications like YouTube, Skype, and VoIP.

### 3.1 Benefits
- **Reduced FIB Lookups**: Figure 1a shows the reduction in FIB-based forwarding. The red line represents the number of FIB lookups with the Set mechanism, while the blue line shows the impact of the Set mechanism. The impact line nearly overlaps with the normal Interest line, indicating that the number of FIB lookups is reduced to 1/Cardinality while maintaining data throughput.
- **PIT Compression**: Figure 1b illustrates the PIT compression effect. The Set bars are lower than the corresponding Interest bars but higher than the 1/Cardinality of the PIT size with normal Interests.
- **Round Trip Delay**: Figure 1c shows the round trip delay, which includes queuing, propagation, and transmission delays. When traffic is light, transmission delay (proportional to packet size) is the main contributor. When traffic is heavy, queuing delay dominates. Although Set packets are larger, they reduce the number of packets, resulting in shorter queuing delays. The simulation results show that when the frequency of sending Interest Sets is between 0 and 20 per second, the Set line is higher than the Interest line. Above 40 per second, the Set line is lower.

## 4. Conclusions
In this paper, we propose the Set mechanism to address the inefficiencies caused by time and space uncertainty in data transmission. The benefits include:

- **Reduced Overhead**: The Set mechanism reduces the number of FIB-based forwardings to 1/Cardinality and decreases the PIT size by more than an order of magnitude.
- **Lower Round Trip Delay**: In heavy traffic, the Set mechanism can reduce round trip delay by 10%, which is valuable for real-time applications.

While the Set mechanism may introduce some inflexibility and data burst issues, these can be mitigated by dynamically adjusting the cardinality and setting a reasonable PIT entry lifetime. Further work will focus on these aspects.

More details on chunk size analysis, application descriptions, pseudocode, and experimental results are available in our technical report [2].
