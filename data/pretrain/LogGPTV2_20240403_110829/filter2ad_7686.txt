INTRODUCTION
NDN (Named Data Networking) provides a pipeline, whilst
Interest packets perform the same ﬂow control and sequenc-
ing function as TCP ACK Packets. Since NDN packets
are independently named, the pipeline does not stall on a
loss. The equivalent of TCP SACK (Selective ACKnowl-
edgement) is intrinsic. Meanwhile, NDN provides more so-
phisticated sequencing mechanism for requesting individual
pieces from large collections of data. The conventional/automatic
parts in the name of chunk, are typically the version marker
and segmentation marker. [1]
The pipeline service provided by NDN is proved to work
well. But NDN pays a high price in order to maintain the
pipeline. For example, the data consumer of VoCCN (Voice
Over CCN) has to send more than 50 Interests per second
and every Interest is forwarded according to FIB (Forward-
ing Information Base) and leaves traceable footprints on ev-
ery router from consumer (The application which requests
data) to provider (The application which provides data orig-
inally). The fundamental reasons for the high spending are
two-fold. Time and space uncertainty of data transfer:
• Time Uncertainty: Consider applications like live Video.
Data packets are made up of samples at quite high rate
and must be transmitted as quickly as possible in or-
der to provide better user experience. Original NDN
opens the pipeline to fetch Data by sending Interest

frequently, which is quite ineﬃcient. Making thing
worse, the pipeline can transmit a speciﬁed Data only
during a short period due to PIT entries’ lifetime is
limited. While the exact moment of Interest arriving
is not absolutely predictable, which may be unable to
match the “rhythm” of sampling, leading to invalid PIT
entries and complexity of application implementation.
One solution is to set a long live PIT entries, but this
creates a potential security vulnerability.
• Space Uncertainty: Consider applications like large ﬁle
transfers. The ﬁle has to be split into chunks with
proper size, since too large chunk size results in a high
loss rate over a best-eﬀorts underlying service, such as
802.3/IP/UDP. The consumer has to send those cor-
responding Interest packets in order to get the whole
ﬁle.
In both cases above, the network ampliﬁes the spending
by a factor of hops between consumer to producer (Though
cache decreases this factor). This means, by reducing the
number of Interest packets sent by consumer, the spending
will decrease a lot.
Our solution is quite simple, we aggregate several Interest
packets from the same ﬂow into one packet, which we call
Interest Set packet. Note that here we distinguish between
Interest packet and Interest Set packet. For short, we will
refer to Interest packet as Interest, and Interest Set packet
as Set. The problem here is that PIT entry may timeout in
a short time before all Data packets are returned. Our trick
is to reset the lifetime timer of the PIT entry after receiving
any corresponding data packet. Here, valid means the name
of the data belongs to the Set and the data has not been
returned before. Thus, solving ineﬃciencies caused by time
and space uncertainty, we maintain the pipeline with a much
lower spending for a relatively longer period.
2. METHODOLOGY
2.1 Packet Description
Interest Set packet, as the name implies, contains multi-
ple Interests in one packet. Those Interests must share the
same name preﬁx. For example, names of diﬀerent segments
of a large ﬁle, names of diﬀerent data samples from a live
video conference application. Here, we use sequence number
to represent the diﬀerent parts. A Set contains a set which is
made up of diﬀerent sequence numbers. The number of ele-
ments in the set is called cardinality. Set contains a Nonce in
order to get ride of looping, just like normal Interest packets.

2.2 Node Model
NDN routers are updated in order to recognize Set, cre-
ate PIT entries attached with Set and execute the trick op-
eration, reset lifetime timer of corresponding PIT entry if
a valid Data is returned. The main part of node model
remains constant. The preudocode of node model can be
found in our tech report [2].
Basically, Set mechanism does not break any principles
of NDN. It just aggregates similar Interests into one packet
and enhance NDN routers to construct the special pipeline.
This pipeline would close if no valid data is returned during
PIT entry’s lifetime. Thus, resources can be recycled, which
potentially defends the attack to routers by sending massive
amounts of Set.
3. EVALUATION & SIMULATION
We use ndnSIM[3] to evaluate the performance with PoP
(Point of Presence) topology of Sprint, which includes 52
nodes and 84 links with real weights. The provider located
on the center of the topology while 8 consumers located on
the edge. Other nodes also request data to provide back-
ground traﬃc if necessarily. Considering sample rate of real
applications, such as YouTube, Skype, VoIP, every Set con-
tains 32 sequence number, i.e. Cardinality = 32.
The obvious beneﬁts of Set are reducing the number of
FIB based forwarding and size of PIT. Figure 1a presents
the lookup overhead. The red line is the number of FIB
based forwarding with Set mechanism. The blue line shows
the impact of Set mechanism (Y-axis value is Cardinality
× Number of Lookup with Set). The impact line nearly
overlaps with normal Interest line, which means, using Set
mechanism, number of FIB based forwarding is reduced to
1/Cardinality while keeping data throughput limited.
Figure 1b shows the PIT compression eﬀect. The Set bars
are clearly much lower than corresponding Interest bars, but
higher than blue bars, which is 1/Cardinality of PIT size
with nomral Interest.
Another parameter is round trip delay, which includes
queueing delay, propagation delay and transmission delay.
When the traﬃc is light, transmission delay, which is propor-
tional to packet size, contributes most to round trip delay.
While when the traﬃc is heavy, queueing delay contributes
the most. Since Set packet which contains sequence num-
ber is larger than normal Interest packet, the transmission
delay of Set mechanism is longer. However, number of pack-
ets under Set mechanism is less, and the queueing delay is
shorter. The simulation result presented in Figure 1c ag-
grees the analysis. When frequency of sending Interest Set
is between 0 and 20 per second, the Set line is higher than
Interest line. While, when the frequency is above 40 per
second, Set line is lower since.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we propose Set mechanism to solve the inef-
ﬁciency caused by time and space uncertainty of data trans-
mission. The beneﬁts include:
• Set mechanism decreases overhead greatly: it reduces
the number of FIB based Forwarding to 1/Cardinality,
while the size of PIT in reduced more than an order of
magnitude in our evaluation.
• Round Trip Delay: When the network traﬃc is heavy,
Set mechanism can decrease round trip delay by 10
percents, which is of great value for those real-time
applications.
Except for the beneﬁts above, we do realize that Set mech-
anism may lead to inﬂexibility to data plane and data burst,
etc. But by adjusting Cardinality dynamically and setting
a reasonable PIT entry’s lifetime, the disadvantages can be
ﬁxed or limited. This should be included in our future work.
More details on chunk size analysis, applications descrip-
tion, pseudocode and experiment results are presented in
our technical report[2].
