I'm updating the Matrix4 docs and there's a method called
Matrix4.makePerspective( fov, aspect, near, far )
Internally this calculates the values of left, right, top and bottom and calls  
Matrix4.makeFrustum( left, right, bottom, top, near, far )  
and it looks like it is intended for use in
PerspectiveCamera.updateProjectionMatrix()
However the PerspectiveCamera calculates its own versions of left, right, top
and bottom in a slightly more complex way, taking into account zoom, view (if
set) and filmOffset, and then calls Matrix4.makeFrustum directly.
So it seems that Matrix4.makePerspective() is superfluous - is there a use
case that I am missing?
