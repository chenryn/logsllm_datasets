## üêõ Bug
My basic Conda environment is python 3.7, but creating a new environment and
installing in it Pytorch ('conda install pytorch-nightly cuda92 -c pytorch'),
python --version gives me 'Python 3.5.6 :: Anaconda, Inc.'.
This bug seems very similar to #9967, although the issue there is supposed to
be closed, so I also left a comment there.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
  1. Install Anaconda with python 3.7 and Cuda 9.2 on Ubuntu 16.04
  2. Create a new environment
  3. Check that python version is still 3.7
  4. Install Pytorch with 'conda install pytorch-nightly cuda92 -c pytorch'
  5. Check the python version now. In my case, it is now 3.5.6
## Expected behavior
Pytorch is said to be working with python 3.7 in the download page, so there's
no reason it would downgrade it.

## Additional context
It's the first time I write an issue on Github, so I apologize in advance if
it is not very clear or something ;)...
Thanks in advance for your help !!
