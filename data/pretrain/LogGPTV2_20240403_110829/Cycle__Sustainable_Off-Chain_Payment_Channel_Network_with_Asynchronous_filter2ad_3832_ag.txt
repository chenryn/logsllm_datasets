#### Utilization of REVIVE in CYCLE
By leveraging REVIVE, the CYCLE protocol can utilize spare communication resources for more frequent rebalancing, thereby enhancing overall performance. This flexibility allows nodes in CYCLE to adjust their batch update strategies based on the network's congestion level, optimizing communication efficiency (see § VI and Fig. 9).

#### Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced CYCLE, the first balancing protocol designed for a sustainable Payment Channel Network (PCN). Unlike existing rebalancing protocols, CYCLE continuously balances the PCN without freezing channels. To evaluate CYCLE, we provided a proof-of-concept implementation and conducted simulations using data from Lightning and Ripple. The results demonstrate that CYCLE can satisfy 31% more payments compared to traditional rebalancing methods, with even greater improvements in PCNs with higher transaction loads. Additionally, the on-chain gas cost of CYCLE is comparable to that of existing rebalancing protocols. Future work will explore the application of CYCLE in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with limited scripting capabilities.

#### Impact of Batch Update
The effectiveness of batch updates is influenced by the noise in the expected offset of participants, which can lead to a global offset unsuitable for the cycle. In practice, the parameter  is typically set to less than 1 [47], resulting in a 2% reduction in the success ratio for CYCLE.

#### Communication Efficiency
We evaluated the performance improvement brought by the batch update mechanism proposed in § VI. The batch size is defined as the time interval between two expected offset updates in seconds. For example, a batch size of 10 means each participant updates and broadcasts its expected offset every 10 seconds. A batch size of 0 indicates immediate broadcasting after each payment. As shown in Fig. 9, increasing the batch size reduces both the success ratio and the number of messages. According to § VI, this is because batch updates slow down the balancing process but also alleviate communication overhead. The benefits are most pronounced with smaller batch sizes, such as 10 or 20. Specifically, a batch size of 10 reduces the message count by half while only decreasing the success ratio by about 2.4%.

#### Related Work
##### Payment Channel Networks
Scaling limitations have led to extensive research on blockchain scaling solutions, including alternative consensus mechanisms [16], [24] and sharding [19], [25], [29], [45], [46]. PCNs offer an orthogonal approach. Initially implemented in Bitcoin for fast one-way payments [42], PCNs were later extended to support bi-directional payments [9], [36]. Solutions like Lightning [26] and Raiden [38] allow multi-hop payments using existing channels. Sprites [34] enhances PCN performance by reducing collateral costs, while AMCU [14] achieves similar goals in blockchains without full smart contract functionality. Blitz [3] proposes a multi-hop payment protocol without two-phase commit, and A2L [43] introduces a backward-compatible and efficient payment channel hub. Lukas et al. [2] present a Bitcoin-compatible virtual channel protocol.

##### Routing Algorithms
Since only channels with sufficient balance can support payments, several studies have focused on routing algorithms. These algorithms aim to find the most efficient paths for transactions, ensuring that the network remains balanced and operational.
