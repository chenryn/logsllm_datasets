When outputting `debugger` keywords in my code and connecting my IDE to the
node debugger it is breaking in the compiled code, not the uncompiled code.
Sourcemaps are stripped from custom codes/pages/etc.
The commons.js and main.js files follow the sourcemaps settings (`devtool:
cheap-module-eval-source-map` in webpack settings by default)
Could this be related with the custom babel setting that are used for node?

  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
The compiled custom code in the .next/dist folder should have sourcemaps
generated according to settings in webpack/babel.
## Current Behavior
No sourcemaps are generated for custom code accessible for server side
debugging. The sourcemaps are however accessible on client side.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a next.js project with a index.js page and sourcemaps enabled (at time of writing the default setting)
  2. Run `next`to start dev server
  3. Open `.next/dist/pages/index.js` and scroll down to the bottom of the file. It will have no `//# sourceMappingURL` comment
  4. Open `.next/dist/main.js` and scroll down to the bottom of the file. It will have a `//# sourceMappingURL` comment!
