# Title: Is the Round-Trip Time Correlated with the Number of Packets in Flight?

## Authors: Saad Biaz and Nitin H. Vaidya

### Abstract
TCP adjusts its sending rate based on packet loss feedback from the network, continuously increasing the rate until a packet is lost (unless constrained by buffer size). Alternative congestion avoidance techniques (CATs) have been proposed to mitigate this aggressive behavior. These CATs use simple statistics on observed round-trip times (RTT) and/or throughput to detect queue build-up. This paper evaluates the ability of these CATs to reliably detect queue build-up under real network conditions by analyzing the correlation between RTT and the number of packets in flight for 14,218 connections over 737 Internet paths. The data, collected by Vern Paxson, show that the correlation between RTT and window size is often weak.

### Introduction
TCP is a widely used protocol for reliable data delivery in the Internet. It adapts to varying network conditions by adjusting its congestion window size based on packet loss. A TCP sender increases its load until packet loss occurs, unless limited by the receiver's buffer size. To avoid such "provoked" losses, several congestion avoidance techniques (CATs) have been proposed. These CATs use simple statistics on observed RTTs and/or throughput to detect queue build-up, thereby preventing congestion losses. If reliable, these techniques can distinguish between packet losses due to congestion and other causes, such as transmission errors. However, previous studies have shown poor performance in distinguishing congestion losses from wireless transmission losses, raising questions about the CATs' ability to detect queue build-up under real network conditions. 

This paper evaluates the rationale behind CATs by analyzing the correlation between RTT and the amount of data in flight for 14,218 TCP connections over 737 Internet paths. The data, though old, provide a unique perspective on various paths with different RTTs. The results confirm and explain findings from previous studies, including those by Padhye et al. and Hengartner et al.

### Terminology and Notations
Figure 1 illustrates the key terms and notations used in this paper:

- **Packet \( P_i \)**: The i-th packet sent by the sender, excluding retransmitted packets.
- **Packet \( P_{Wj} \)**: The j-th packet for which an RTT sample is collected, referred to as a "monitored" packet.
- **Packet \( P_{Fk} \)**: The k-th relevant packet at the front of a burst.
- **Packet \( P_{Tm} \)**: The m-th relevant packet at the tail of a burst.
- **\( W(P_i) \)**: The amount of data in flight for packet \( P_i \), measured in bytes or packets.
- **Round-Trip Time (RTT) \( RTT(P_i) \)**: The duration from when \( P_i \) is transmitted until an acknowledgment is received.
- **Sign(x)**: A function that returns 1, 0, or -1 if x is positive, null, or negative, respectively.
- **Connection \( C_l \)**: The l-th TCP connection in the dataset, with l ranging from 1 to 14,218.
- **Bandwidth \( B(C_l) \)**: An estimate of the bandwidth of the bottleneck link for connection \( C_l \).

The following coefficients of correlation are defined for connection \( C_l \):

- **\( \rho(C_l, RTT(P_i), W(P_i)) \)**: The coefficient of correlation between RTT and the amount of data in flight for relevant packets.
- **\( \rho_W(C_l, RTT(P_{Wi}), W(P_{Wi})) \)**: Similarly defined for monitored packets.
- **\( \rho_F(C_l, RTT(P_{Fi}), W(P_{Fi})) \)**: Similarly defined for packets at the front of bursts.
- **\( \rho_T(C_l, RTT(P_{Ti}), W(P_{Ti})) \)**: Similarly defined for packets at the tail of bursts.

The coefficient of correlation \( \rho(C_l, x_i, y_i) \) for connection \( C_l \) is given by:
\[
\rho(C_l, x_i, y_i) = \frac{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\]
where \( \bar{x} \) and \( \bar{y} \) are the means of \( x_i \) and \( y_i \), respectively.

Additional coefficients of correlation for the direction of change (increase or decrease) in RTT and W are defined as follows:

- **\( \rho_v(C_l, Sign(\delta RTT), Sign(\delta W)) \)**: The coefficient of correlation between the sign of the change in RTT and the sign of the change in the amount of data in flight for all packets.
- **\( \rho_{Wv}(C_l, Sign(\delta RTT), Sign(\delta W)) \)**: Similarly defined for monitored packets.
- **\( \rho_{Fv}(C_l, Sign(\delta RTT), Sign(\delta W)) \)**: Similarly defined for packets at the front of bursts.
- **\( \rho_{Tv}(C_l, Sign(\delta RTT), Sign(\delta W)) \)**: Similarly defined for packets at the tail of bursts.

These metrics are used to evaluate the degree of relationship between RTT and the amount of data in flight.

### Conclusion
This paper provides a detailed analysis of the correlation between RTT and the number of packets in flight, challenging the effectiveness of CATs in detecting queue build-up. The results indicate that the correlation is often weak, suggesting that alternative approaches may be needed for reliable congestion control.
