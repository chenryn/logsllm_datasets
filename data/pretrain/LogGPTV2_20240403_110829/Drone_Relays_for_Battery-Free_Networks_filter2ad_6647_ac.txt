an obstacle (e.g., furniture). As a result, the direct path may
not always be the path with the strongest signal. In §5.2, we
describe how RFly leverages the structure of indoor multipath
to identify the direct path and localize the RFIDs.
In what follows, we discuss how RFly addresses each of these
challenges.
5.1 Disentangling the Phase Half-Links
We start by characterizing the problem of the phase entanglement
before we delve into the solution.
Phase Received through the Relay. Let us start by assuming that
there is a single direct (line-of-sight) path from the reader to the
relay (with distance d1) and a single path from the relay to the reader
(with distance d2). Mathematically, it follows from Eq. 2 that we can
express the channel of the signal received at the reader as:
−j2π (f (2d1/c )+f2 (2d2/c ))
hLOS = e
(7)
where f and f2 correspond to the frequencies of the signals on each
of the half-links as explained in §4.2.5
In practice, however, due to indoor multipath, the packets traverse
multiple paths on each of the half-links, whose distances we denote
d1i and d2i respectively, as shown in Fig. 5. Due to the superposition
of signals over the wireless medium, the different paths linearly
combine at the receiver. Hence, in the presence of multipath, we may
express the received channel at the reader as:
h =
−j2π (f (2d1i /c )+f2 (2d2j /c ))
e

j
Since each of the paths on the first half-link traverses all the paths
of the second half-link and vice-versa, we may re-factor the above
5Note that, in practice, the effect of the second half-link would be f2 + f ′ − f . However,
f ′ − f is less than few hundred Hz; hence, it is negligible in the channel estimates.
The equation shows that even if we know the location of the drone,
we still cannot isolate the phase of the relay-RFID half-link. This is
because the position of the drone would only allow us to estimate
the impact of the direct path on the reader-relay channel but not that
of the multipath. As a result, even if we factor out this impact, we
still cannot isolate the relay-RFID half-link because of the residual
multipath on the reader-relay half-link.
Embedding an RFID into the relay. Next, in order to separate the
two half-link channels, we embed an RFID into our relay itself.
(Note that even if the embedded RFID is outside the reading range of
the reader, the reader may still capture its phase through the relay.)
Since the on-board RFID and the relay are co-located, the RFID’s
channel as recorded by the reader reduces entirely to the half-link
between the reader and the relay.6 Hence, in order to eliminate the
impact of the reader-relay half-link, the reader may simply divide
the channel of any given RFID by the channel of the relay-embedded
RFID hb . The resulting equation becomes entirely a factor of the
half-link between the relay and the RFID in the environment as
shown below:

Aside from enabling RFly to eliminate the impact of the half-
link between the reader and the relay, this approach provides two
additional interesting features. First, since we embed the RFID into
the relay, it abides by the EPC Gen2 protocol which enables RFly
to naturally avoid collisions between the relay-embedded RFID and
other RFIDs in the environment. By storing the identifier of the relay-
embedded RFID on the reader, the reader can always distinguish
it from other RFIDs in the environment. Second, while the relay-
embedded RFID will likely be out of the range of the reader itself,
it is always within the range of the relay. Said differently, the relay-
embedded RFID can always be powered up by the relay since it
is in close proximity to the relay’s antennas on the drone. Hence,
whenever the reader receives a response from the relay-embedded
RFID, it knows that the drone’s relay is within its radio range. This
enables the reader to identify when the relay itself is within its radio
range whenever it can decode the relay-embedded RFID.
Finally, we note that since the channel of the relay-embedded
RFID consists entirely of the half-link between the ground-based
reader and the relay, this channel may be used to localize the drone
itself by leveraging standard SAR equations. However, localizing
the drone itself solely from RF measurements is outside the scope
of this paper. Instead, in this paper, we rely on accurate vision-based
systems for localizing and navigating the drone.
5.2 Localization Algorithm
Now that we have isolated the channel corresponding to the half-link
between the relay and an RFID in the environment, we can proceed
to localizing the RFID.
6In practice, it still has a multiplicative constant which does not change as the drone flies
since the distance between the relay-embedded RFID and the relay remains constant. As
a result, we can ignore that constant since it does not affect the antenna array equations
and can be factored out.
Drone Relays for Battery-Free Networks

At a high level, RFly leverages the fact that the drone’s movement
emulates an antenna array and applies standard array equations to
perform localization. Antenna arrays exploit small phase changes
due to distance in order to localize an object of interest. The literature
on antenna arrays discusses various formulations [37]. Among these,
non-linear projections are the most suitable for RFly since they can
synthesize RF measurements over long trajectories.
For simplicity, let us focus on how this localization method works
in 2D space. Intuitively, this formulation leverages the fact that every
point (x, y) in 2D space can be described by a set of distances from
the different points along the drone’s trajectory. Hence, to localize,
it applies a matched filter on all possible locations and chooses the
highest peak.7
Mathematically, consider K locations along the drone’s trajectory
where it captures responses from a given RFID. If the coordinates of
these points are (x1, y1) . . . (xK , yK ), and the isolated channels for
a given RFID are (h′
K ), the 2D location of the RFID may be
estimated as:

Fig. 6(a) depicts an example where the RFID is in line-of-sight
of the relay. The figure shows a heatmap of P (x, y) in 2D space,
where red indicates high likelihood of the RFID’s location and navy
blue indicates low likelihood. The white triangle indicates the actual
location of the RFID, and the cyan line marks the robot’s trajectory.
We make the following observations from this experiment:
• RFly’s estimated location of the RFID (denoted by the peak
of this heatmap in dark red) is very accurate relative to the
RFID’s actual location, with an error less than 7 cm.
• The heatmap exhibits few light blue patches. These are due
to environmental noise as well as the sidelobes of the antenna
array projections.
• RFly can obtain an RFID’s 2D location from a 1D trajectory
since it leverages non-linear projections in Eq. 12.
The above example demonstrates that RFly can estimate an RFID’s
location by simply picking the peak in P (x, y) when the line-of-sight
path is the most dominant. However, indoor environments are abound
with multipath due to the various reflectors (walls, furniture, ceil-
ings, etc.). Fig. 6(b) shows P (x, y) for an experiment run with heavy
multipath due to steel shelves in the surrounding environment. The
figure shows multiple dark red regions, indicating various potential
positions for the RFID.
To address multipath, RFly’s underlying insight is that indirect
reflections (caused by reflectors) always arrive along a longer path
than the direct path from the RFID to the relay. Hence, the “ghost”
locations caused by multipath reflections are always further from the
robot’s trajectory than the actual tag location. RFly harnesses this
insight in its localization process. In particular, rather than picking
the highest peak in Eq. 12, it chooses the peak nearest to its trajectory.
7The literature also discusses multi-resolution algorithms for optimizing the search,
which we omit in our discussion for brevity and refer the interested reader to [9, 37, 46].

where red indicates high likelihood of the RFID’s location and navy
blue indicates low likelihood. The white triangle indicates the actual
location of an RFID and the cyan line denotes the drone’s trajectory
used for localization.
Finally, we list a few interesting features of RFly’s localization
algorithm:
• While the above localization method was described in 2D for
simplicity, it can be extended to 3D if the robot’s trajectory is
two-dimensional.
• RFly’s localization accuracy improves when integrating Eq. 12
over longer trajectories as we show empirically in §7.3. This
is because a larger aperture results in narrower beamwidths
for localization [9, 37]. In practice, however, the integration
path is limited to 3-5 meters due to the limited communication
range between the relay and the RFID tag.
• The above localization algorithm naturally extends to multi-
ple tags in the environment. In particular, the standard RFID
protocol (the EPC Gen2) can read multiple tags, and our
algorithm operates on the channels of each of the tags inde-
pendently.
• Aside from the ability to accurately localize RFIDs, RFly’s
approach of leveraging drones does not suffer from blind
spots which are typically very challenging with stationary
RFID readers (due to destructive interference or orientation
mismatch) [31]. This is because the drone can capture each
RFID’s response from different perspectives.
• RFly’s algorithm can seamlessly deal with scenarios where
an RFID is within the communication range of both the relay
and an RFID reader in the environment. In such scenarios,
the channel from the (stationary) reader to the RFID remains
constant, while that from the relay to the RFID varies due to
motion. As a result, the constant channel is factored out by
Eq. 12 and does not affect the localization results.
• It is worth noting that the reader may still use f in Eq. 12
despite the fact that the isolated channel is measured at f2.
This owes to the fact that the relay can ensure that ( f −
f2)/f < 0.01 by shifting the center frequency by as little as
1MHz while still ensuring that the half-links do not interfere
as explained in §4.3.

6 IMPLEMENTATION & EVALUATION
We built a prototype of RFly. The system consists of a lightweight
relay which can be mounted on drone and used to detect and localize
battery-free UHF RFIDs.
6.1 Hardware Prototype of RFly’s Relay
We built RFly’s relay, discussed in §4 into a custom designed PCB
circuit shown in Fig. 7(a). The circuit schematic is shown in Fig. 8.
Mirrored Architecture: Recall that the relay has a mirrored archi-
tecture in order to compensate for frequency and phase offsets. The
relay consists of two paths: the downlink forwarding path and the
uplink forwarding path. Each path employs two RF mixers. The first
mixer downconverts the signal to baseband while the second mixer
upconverts the baseband signal back to passband. The frequencies
for upconversion and downcoversion are generated by frequency
synthesizers.
Self-interference Cancellation: Self-interference cancellation is
achieved through a combination of frequency shifts and baseband fil-
ters. Specifically, the relay eliminates inter-link interference through
baseband filtering. In particular, a low-pass filter with cut-off fre-
quency at 100kHz and a bandpass filter with center frequency at
500kHz are implemented in the downlink and uplink respectively. As
a result, the baseband filter only allows the reader’s query command
to pass on the downlink; and, the bandpass filter only allows the
RFID tag’s response to pass on the uplink. Together, the baseband
and passband filters effectively block the reader’s query signal from
leaking from the downlink path to the uplink path and block the
RFID tag’s response from leaking from the uplink path to the down-
link path, achieving high inter-link isolations. To eliminate intra-link
interference, the relay uses different frequencies for downconversion
and upconversion. The frequencies are separated by a frequency
shift larger than the bandwidth of both the lowpass and bandpass
filters to ensure that no signal feeds back from the output to input on
each of the downlink and uplink paths, resulting in high intra-link
isolation.
Tunable Amplification: Both the downlink and uplink have an
amplification chain which is implemented as a serial combination of
amplifiers and matching pads. The downlink also employs a power
amplifier (PA) at the output with a 1-dB compression point of 29dBm.
Figure 8: RFly’s relay schematic. The relay has a mirrored archi-
tecture to eliminate phase and frequency offsets that would otherwise
preclude localization.
To maximize the efficiency of the PA, we insert a drive amplifier.
All amplifiers aside from the PA are variable gain amplifiers (VGA)
so that the gain in each stage can be tuned independently according
to the communication range needed. Few points are worth noting
about how the VGAs are programmed:
• The total gain on each of the uplink and downlink is inde-
pendently constrained by the amount of intra-link isolation.
This ensures that each of the links does not resonate through
positive feedback.
• The sum of all the gains (in Fig. 8) is constrained by the total
achievable isolation from both the inter-link and intra-link
self-interference cancellation.
• Since the communication range with battery-free RFIDs is
primarily limited by the downlink (which must deliver suffi-
cient power and modulation depth to an RFID), the downlink
gain should be maximized subject to the above constraints.
• Maximizing the gain on the downlink (as per the previous
