5. Cost-effective Design of the Fault 
Management Server  
During  the  development  phase  of  a  high-availability 
communication  system,  we  may  face  an  optimization 
problem, i.e., we want to minimize the cost of achieving 
the  system  availability  requirement,  or  maximize  the 
system  availability given the development budget. Since 
we focus on the fault management server in this paper, the 
cost-effective design of the functional units is beyond the 
scope of this paper, and the availabilities of the functional 
units are assumed fixed.

Because q (i) is an increasing function of pc, F
(pc)=pf  is a 
decreasing function of pc.  The typical plot is illustrated in 
Figure  4a.  The  dashed  curve  corresponds  to  the  case 
where  As  =A*s  while  the  solid  curve  corresponds  to  As 
=A**s. The optimization problem is trying to find a point 
(p**f, p**c) on the solid curve to minimize the cost.  
Obviously, C1(pc) and C2(pf) are increasing functions of p c 
and  pf  respectively.  Therefore,  C2(F
(pc)) is a decreasing 
function  of  pc  (see  Figure  4c).    It can be concluded that 
there  exists  a  unique  point  (p**f,  p**c)  minimizing  the 
cost C1(pc)+C2(F
(pc)) (see Figure 4d).

The  multi-objective optimization problem can be solved 
with  the  methods  in  [9].  Note  that  C1  (pc),  C2(pf  ),  and 
C3(Am) are increasing, but  may not be linear functions.  
In  this  paper,  we  solve  a  simpler  optimization  problem.
