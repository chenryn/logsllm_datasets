While learning debugging, I ended up installing `gdb` and then `gdb-peda`. Now, I would like to uninstall `gdb-peda`. Could someone please guide me on how to do this?

**Response:**

To uninstall `gdb-peda`, you can follow these steps:

1. **Locate the Peda Directory:**
   The Peda directory is typically located in your home directory. You can find it by navigating to:
   ```
   ~/.gdbinit
   ```
   or
   ```
   ~/peda
   ```

2. **Remove the Peda Directory:**
   You can remove the Peda directory by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   rm -rf ~/.gdbinit
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   rm -rf ~/peda
   ```

3. **Verify the Uninstallation:**
   After removing the Peda directory, you can verify that `gdb-peda` has been uninstalled by starting `gdb` and checking if the Peda interface is no longer present.

Once you have completed these steps, you should have your original `gdb` back without the Peda extension.

If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!
