User: Which is better to use in a python automation script for following simple operations
To create a zip file and copy it or rename it to a new location.
Using python inbuilt functions or terminal commands through os.system modules is better?
Assistant: In general I'd say use the python libraries where possible - that way it'll be more portable, e.g. you won't need to worry about different commands or command options on various systems, and also if you need to change anything it's easier to do just python code.
