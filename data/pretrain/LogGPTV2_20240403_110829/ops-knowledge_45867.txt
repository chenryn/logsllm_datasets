User: I am trying to install tables package in Ubuntu 14.04 but sems like it is complaining.
I am trying to install it using PyCharm and its package installer, however seems like it is complaining about HDF5 package.
However, seems like I cannnot find any hdf5 package to install before tables.
Could anyone explain the procedure to follow?
Assistant: Try to install libhdf5-7 and python-tables via apt
