Question: "When designing the hash tree for dm-verity, which of the following steps correctly outlines the process of constructing the hash tree for a system image?"
 "A": "Choose a random salt, unsparse the system image into 2k blocks, hash each block with SHA256, concatenate hashes, pad to 2k boundary, and repeat until a single hash remains."
 "B": "Choose a fixed salt, divide the system image into 4k blocks, hash each block with SHA1, concatenate hashes, pad to 4k boundary, and repeat until a single hash remains."
 "C": "Choose a random salt, divide the system image into 4k blocks, hash each block with SHA256, concatenate hashes, pad to 4k boundary, and repeat until a single hash remains."
 "D": "Choose a random salt, compress the system image into 8k blocks, hash each block with SHA512, concatenate hashes, pad to 8k boundary, and repeat until a single hash remains."
Answer: C
