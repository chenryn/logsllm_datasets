To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have comprehensively profiled primary and secondary metabolites across various phenotypes of pepper in relation to fruit maturity stages. Additionally, these studies have not examined the metabolic networks by integrating large-scale metabolite data with metabolic pathways. We conducted a metabolic profiling of phytochemicals, including amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, free phenolic acids, capsaicinoids, carotenoids, phytosterols, policosanols, tocopherols, volatiles, and fatty acids, in 13 pepper cultivars at different fruit maturity stages. Our results yielded 10,218 data points from three repetitions of 131 metabolites obtained from the fruit samples.

Subsequently, we employed multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA; Pearson’s correlation analysis; hierarchical clustering analysis, HCA) and PathVisio 3.3.0 to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships among the metabolites and pepper samples. In the mevalonic acid pathway, the content of phytosterols such as campesterol, beta-sitosterol, cholesterol, and stigmasterol decreased in the mature fruit stage, confirming the negative correlation between carotenoids and tocopherols revealed by PCA and HCA. A complex carbon and nitrogen metabolic network was modulated by fruit ripening. Correlation-based network analysis suggested that metabolism is substantially coordinated during the ripening process.

**Regression Model-Based Metabolomics Approach to Propose New Quality Markers for Specialty Coffee**

**Presenting Author:** Sastia P. Putri, Osaka University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Tomoya Irifune, Yusianto, Eiichiro Fukusaki

Specialty coffee is defined based on cupping scores of 10 attributes (fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, uniformity, balance, clean cup, sweetness, overall) according to the protocol established by the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Despite the increasing demand for specialty coffee, there is limited research on the relationship between component profiles and coffee quality. This study is crucial for further quality improvement in coffee.

We conducted a regression model-based metabolomics approach to propose new quality markers for specialty coffee. A total of 97 hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds were detected in 10 specialty coffee samples using GC/MS-based component profiling. Prediction models for 7 attributes (fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, overall) and the final score were constructed using Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structure (OPLS) regression analysis. These prediction models showed high performance (R² > 0.9, Q² > 0.9). Important compounds for each attribute were proposed based on Variable Influence on Projection (VIP). Galactinol was identified as a new candidate quality marker for specialty coffee, showing the highest VIP in the prediction models for fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, and overall score. Quantitation of galactinol in the lowest and highest scoring samples in the prediction model revealed a significant increase in galactinol concentration, with the highest scoring sample (cupping score 86.75) showing an 8-fold increase compared to the lowest scoring sample (cupping score 80.25). The identification of galactinol as a new quality marker will be useful for improving coffee quality.

**Metabolomics: An Invaluable Phenotyping Tool in Food Science**

**Presenting Author:** Melissa Fitzgerald, University of Queensland, Australia  
**Co-Authors:** Venea Dara Daygon, Sara Ghorbani Gorji, Crystal Concepcion, Lourdes Urban Andalete

The field of metabolomics has evolved over the years, primarily in chemistry laboratories. However, recent advancements have made these tools more accessible for routine phenotyping. The stability and reproducibility of these tools enable the integration of phenotyping datasets with other omics data, such as lipidomics and genomics. This integration allows us to complete the picture from the gene, its expression into a protein, and the phenotype produced by the action of that protein. As we develop new ideas to improve the flavor, taste, and nutritional value of food, metabolomics and other omics platforms provide invaluable data for transformational solutions in the food industry. Metabolomics has enabled the discovery of genes to enhance rice aroma, methods to prolong the shelf-life of food with natural ingredients, insights into how lipids impact the sensory properties of rice, and ways to define rancidity based on volatile compounds. We will report our discoveries for various foods, primarily using metabolomics, lipidomics, and genomics platforms, and demonstrate the value of these discoveries to agriculture and food industries in Australia.

Excessive carbohydrate intake is a major risk factor for lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes. Clinical application of biomarkers that reflect dietary intake is essential for nutrition education. In this study, we screened for biomarkers reflecting carbohydrate intake using a metabolomics approach. Seven healthy volunteers consumed one week of white bread followed by one week of white rice. Plasma samples were collected before and after each intervention, and non-targeted analysis using LC/MS was performed. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis discriminated four groups, revealing dynamic changes in metabolites reflecting white bread or rice intake. To further investigate biomarkers reflecting white bread intake, we compared PLS analyses of samples after the periods of bread and rice intake. We screened for peaks in mass chromatograms that specifically reflected white bread intake. Next, to ascertain whether these metabolites changed time-dependently, we analyzed samples collected seven times over a 24-hour period after single intakes of white bread or white rice. We found metabolites identical to those after one-week intake, suggesting that they include external metabolites derived from the food composition itself. Thus, we identified candidates for biomarkers that reflect carbohydrate intake, such as white bread.

**Compositional Assessment of Genetically Modified Soybean Containing Thioredoxin-Encoding Gene**

**Presenting Author:** Ye Jin Kim, Incheon National University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Young Jin Park, Ju-Seok Seo, Jung-Ho Park, Chang-Gi Kim, Jae Kwang Kim, Sung-Dug Oh

The development and cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have increased significantly in recent years. Genetically modified (GM) soybean event CT-4025 was developed for cosmetic applications, containing a gene encoding thioredoxin (TRX) to improve skin whitening. Additionally, the phosphinothricin-N-acetyltransferase gene was used as a selectable marker for glufosinate tolerance. Commercialization of GM soybeans requires safety assessments. Therefore, we assessed the compositional equivalence between GM soybeans (non-sprayed and sprayed with glufosinate) and non-transgenic soybeans. Forty-six key nutrients (proximates, amino acids, fatty acids, isoflavones, vitamins, and anti-nutrients) were analyzed. The soybeans were cultivated in 2017 at two representative regions (Ochang and Jeonju) in the Republic of Korea. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear model and principal component analysis (PCA). Most analyzed components in the GM soybeans showed non-significant differences compared to the non-transgenic soybeans in the linear model. PCA results indicated clear discrimination between the two regions rather than the soybean genotypes. In the loading plot, isoflavones such as malonyldaidzin, malonylglycitin, glycitin, and genistin contributed to the separation between Ochang and Jeonju. These comparisons support that CT-4025 is compositionally equivalent to non-transgenic soybeans. The results of this study can serve as a useful tool for investigating compositional similarities between GM and non-GM foods.

**Differences in the Metabolomic Profile and Microbial Composition of Soil Supporting Burkea africana Growth**

**Presenting Author:** Lufuno Ethel Nemadodzi, University of South Africa, South Africa  
**Co-Authors:** Jacques Vervoort, Gerhard Prinsloo

Burkea africana (Wild syringa) is a leguminous tree widely used for medicinal purposes, distributed in Namibia, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and South Africa. These trees grow in clusters on dry, acidic, sandy soils impoverished of most nutrients, particularly phosphorus. The study aimed to determine the factors responsible for the successful growth of Burkea africana in nature, as all efforts for commercial production have been unsuccessful. We investigated the metabolic profile, chemical composition, and microbial composition of soils where Burkea africana grows (Burkea soil) versus where it does not (non-Burkea soil). 1H-NMR metabolomic analysis revealed different metabolites in the respective soils. Trehalose, betaine, choline-like, and carnitine-like compounds were found in higher concentrations in Burkea soils, while acetate, lactate, and formate were more prevalent in non-Burkea soils. LC-MS analysis showed higher levels of amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamine in Burkea soils. DNA was extracted from the soil and sequenced. BLAST analysis was used to analyze the microbial diversity (bacterial and fungal) and composition in both soils. Penicillium species were prevalent in Burkea soils and were the main discriminant between the two soils. The variances in fungal composition suggest that species supremacy plays a role in the development of Burkea africana trees.

**Profiling Glucosinolates Using LC-MS in Seeds of Camelina sativa L. Crantz**

**Presenting Author:** Rong Zhou, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada  
**Co-Authors:** Ning Xu, Kevin C. Falk, Margaret Y. Gruber

Camelina sativa L. Crantz, a member of the Brassicaceae family, is heat and drought tolerant, making it a suitable alternative crop for marginal lands. Its seeds contain three glucosinolates: glucoarabin (9-(methylsulfinyl)nonylglucosinolate or GS9), glucocamelinin (10-(methylsulfinyl)decylglucosinolate or GS10), and 11-(methylsulfinyl)undecylglucosinolate (GS11). The structures of these glucosinolates are similar to that of glucoraphanin (4-(methylsulfinyl)-butylglucosinolate), whose degradation product is thought to be an anti-cancer compound. Glucosinolates were extracted and converted to desulfoglucosinolates based on AOCS Official Method Ak 1-92. Analysis was performed using Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photodiode Array Detector-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-TQD) equipped with a BEH Shield RP18 column (2.1 x 50 mm; 1.7 µm). The initial conditions (100% water at 0.8 mL/min) were held for 0.3 minutes, followed by a linear solvent gradient of 0% to 25% acetonitrile (v/v) over the next 6.7 minutes. Desulfoglucosinolates were quantified at 229 nm and identified by monitoring the characteristic loss of 162.2 mass units using MS/MS constant neutral loss scans. UPLC reduced the typical LC run time for camelina desulfoglucosinolates from 25-50 minutes to 10 minutes, consuming 60% less acetonitrile. The camelina accessions surveyed contained 21-31 µmol of glucosinolates per gram of seed: GS9 (4.6-7.0 µmol/g seeds), GS10 (13.7-20.2 µmol/g seeds), and GS11 (2.5-3.6 µmol/g seeds). Additionally, we identified several putative minor glucosinolates, including 8-(methylsulfinyl)octyl glucosinolate (GS8), based on their mass spectra. Further work is needed to confirm the identity of these minor glucosinolates.

**Bitter Melon Triterpenoids Regulate Human Gut Microbiome and Potentially Benefit Metabolic Conditions**

**Presenting Author:** Jia Liu, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, China

Bitter melon, a widely cultivated vegetable and medicinal herb from the Cucurbitaceae family, is used as a botanical dietary supplement in Asia for treating dyslipidemic conditions, diabetes, and obesity. The impact of bitter melon triterpenoids (BMTs) on the gut microbiome was investigated. The results showed that BMTs, including tetracyclic and pentacyclic triterpenes, could influence the gut microbiota, but the effects varied among different volunteers. BMTs could be clustered based on their influence on the microbiota, with some showing stronger effects. Proportions of beneficial bacteria were significantly promoted by BMTs, while proportions of opportunistic pathogens were considerably decreased. Moreover, BMTs influenced bile acid metabolism. After treatment, the concentration of TGR5 agonists and Farnesoid X Receptor antagonist bile acids increased, indicating an increase in glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion. Component analysis of bitter melon from different regions revealed that the proportion of pentacyclic triterpenes in bitter melons from Guangdong was significantly higher than that from Shandong and Hunan. Since different BMTs influence the microbiota and bile acid metabolism diversely, the effects of bitter melons with different chemotypes may vary. In conclusion, bitter melons could benefit the treatment of metabolic disorders through their influence on the microbiota.

**Metabolomic Mapping of Chemodiversity in Microbial Strains Using NMR and Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) to Find Potential Biomarkers**

**Presenting Author:** John Gauvin, DSM, Netherlands  
**Co-Authors:** Abel Folch Fortuny, Margriet Hendriks, Adriana Carvalho de Souza, Peter van de Vondervoort

NMR has become an established technique for metabolic profiling, providing information on a broad range of compound classes at various concentrations. In proton NMR, many compounds give multiple signals within the proton spectrum, which can be used in statistical analysis to detect patterns in multivariate approaches. We used the metabolic profiles of microbial strains to build an MSPC-based model to identify potential biomarkers from the chemodiversity portrayed in spectra. MSPC has been used in industrial processes with complex parameters and strongly multivariate data to detect and diagnose deviations in incoming production batches. MSPC can be used to build a model from "non-hits," considering them as normal operating conditions. "Hits" can then be projected in the model and analyzed as outlier observations. In this work, an MSPC-based model was created to map and distinguish biomarkers from general metabolites.

**Metabolic Engineering of Ustilago trichophora TZ1 for the Improvement of Malic Acid Production from Glycerol Using Metabolomics Approaches**

**Presenting Author:** An Phan, RWTH Aachen, Germany  
**Co-Authors:** An N.T. Phan, Lisa Prigolovkin, Lars M. Blank

U. trichophora has gained attention for its ability to use glycerol, a waste stream from biodiesel production, to produce malic acid. Unlike other commercial filamentous fungi, Ustilaginaceae can remain haploid and non-filamentous, making them suitable for industrial applications. Previous optimizations achieved the strain U. trichophora TZ1, which has the highest reported malic acid titre for microbial production from glycerol. However, the production yield was low. The main obstacle for further strain improvement is the lack of knowledge about the U. trichophora metabolic network. In this study, we aim to decipher and reconstruct the metabolic network in U. trichophora TZ1 to improve malic acid production using GC-MS-based metabolomics. Central carbon metabolic pathway metabolites were identified and quantified during the malic acid production phase. The main by-product formation pathways in malic acid production from glycerol were revealed. By using metabolic engineering and medium optimization, we decreased the level of by-products and successfully improved malic acid production in U. trichophora TZ1.

**LC/MS-Based Metabolomics Analysis for the Improvement of 1-Butanol Production in Engineered Cyanobacterial Synechococcus elongatus**

**Presenting Author:** Artnice Fathima, Osaka University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Artnice Mega, Derrick Chuang, Walter Laviña, James Liao, Sastia Putri, Eiichiro Fukusaki

Sustainable 1-butanol production using photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, has garnered interest among researchers. 1-Butanol is natively produced via a CoA-dependent pathway in Clostridia species. A cyanobacterial strain, Synechococcus elongatus, capable of producing 1-butanol, named BUOHSE, was developed by introducing a modified CoA-dependent pathway. However, 1-butanol production in this strain is low compared to other model microorganisms. Metabolomics approaches for strain improvement have been widely employed in various microorganisms, enabling rapid detection of important metabolites and rate-limiting steps in the production pathway. Comparative metabolome analysis of cyanobacterial strains producing 1-butanol was performed to improve 1-butanol titer. Using ion-pair reversed-phase LC/MS, the reaction from butanoyl-CoA to butanal, catalyzed by PduP enzyme, was identified as a rate-limiting step. A new strain, DC7, with improved PduP activity, was developed. This strain showed a 33% increase in 1-butanol titer and a decreased level of butanoyl-CoA, indicating that the butanoyl-CoA to butanal reaction was improved. Metabolome analysis of DC7 and BUOHSE showed that acetyl-CoA was highly accumulated in DC7. To utilize this enhanced level of acetyl-CoA for 1-butanol formation, acetyl-CoA carboxylase was overexpressed in DC7, resulting in strain DC11, which reached a production titer of 418.7 mg/L in 6 days, cutting production time in half. In conclusion, metabolomics-assisted strain improvement demonstrated the utility of metabolomics in effectively identifying rate-limiting steps and targets for improvement in biosynthesis pathways.

**GC-MS Metabolic Profiling of Volatile Compounds Produced by Actinobacteria**

**Presenting Author:** Lada Brazdova, Institute of Microbiology, Czech Republic  
**Co-Authors:** Bara Seidlova, Zdenek Kamenik

Actinobacteria, particularly the genera Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, Rhodococcus, and others, are important producers of bioactive metabolites, including antimicrobials, antitumor agents, immunosuppressants, and signaling molecules. Mainstream research tends to focus on compounds suitable for liquid chromatography, while volatile compounds may be missed unless analyzed by gas chromatography. We cultured various Actinobacteria strains with novel gene clusters, including those encoding the biosynthesis of new compounds with 4-alkyl-L-proline moieties. We determined the profile of volatile compounds by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and processed the data using various approaches, including GNPS molecular networking for GC-MS data.

**LC-MS/MS and GC-MS Metabolomics Identifies Feedstock Components Inhibitory to Growth of Engineered Microbial Strains**

**Presenting Author:** Mona Elbadawi-Sidhu, Amyris, United States  
**Co-Authors:** Chia-Wei Lu, Perry Kumagai, Quinn Mitrovich, Judith Denery

Amyris aims to deliver high-quality, renewable products from sustainable resources, including cellulosic sugars. Advanced microbial engineering and state-of-the-art analytics are implemented to propel industrial synthetic biology and manufacturing. Targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics promote data-driven strain and process design. One application focused on developing strains capable of thriving on wood-derived cellulosic feedstocks. The conversion of wood into monosaccharides produces side products that inhibit the growth of highly engineered yeast strains. To better characterize these compounds, metabolomics was used to elucidate the complex composition of the feedstock. Polar and non-polar chromatography methods coupled with LC-MS/MS and GC-MS were used to broaden the scope of metabolic profiles. A multi-pronged approach, including bioassay-guided fractionation of hydrolysate and spent hydrolysate, informed the untargeted analysis, which in turn informed the targeted analysis and literature search of known feedstock components. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identified six novel components of cellulosic hydrolysate. In total, 70 compounds were tested, and a combination of 26 metabolites accounted for the observed growth inhibition. A summary of the analytical workflow and biological impact is presented.

**Intracellular Metabolite Profiling and Optimization of Metabolome Extraction Methods for Clostridium carboxidivorans Fermenting Syngas**

**Presenting Author:** Yu Eun Cheong, Korea University, South Korea  
**Co-Authors:** Jungyeon Kim, Kyoung Heon Kim

Clostridium carboxidivorans, which ferments CO to biofuels via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, has received increased attention. Since CO is a unique substrate and is metabolized differently from common carbon sources like glucose, it is necessary to analyze intracellular metabolite profiles for CO fermentation by C. carboxidivorans to suggest clues for metabolic engineering. When fermenting syngas, the metabolite profiles of C. carboxidivorans can differ from those under normal conditions. Therefore, it is essential to optimize the metabolite extraction solvent for syngas-fermenting C. carboxidivorans. Compared to glucose media, CO-containing syngas media allowed higher levels of intracellular fatty acid synthesis and changes in fatty acid metabolism, possibly due to cofactor imbalance. High levels of intracellular fatty acids could be used to produce high-value chemicals by further microbial engineering. Evaluation of extraction solvents revealed that a mixture of water-isopropanol-methanol (2:2:5, v/v/v) is the best extraction solvent, showing higher extraction capability and reproducibility than pure methanol, the conventional solvent for clostridia. This is the first metabolomic study to demonstrate the unique metabolite profiles of CO fermentation and the optimal metabolite extraction solvent for C. carboxidivorans fermenting CO.

**Development of LC-MS/MS Based Acyl-CoAs Analysis Method and Its Application to Streptomyces coelicolor**

**Presenting Author:** Katsuaki Nitta, Osaka University, Japan  
**Co-Authors:** Masahiro Furuno, Sastia Prama Putri, Eriko Takano, Eiichiro Fukusaki

Acyl-CoAs are important intermediates in central carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and other pathways, including polyketide antibiotics synthesis. A comprehensive analysis platform for acyl-CoAs is necessary to facilitate pathway intermediate analysis. One challenge in acyl-CoAs analysis is the strong interaction with metal parts of the LC-MS system, leading to peak tailing in liquid chromatography, making it difficult to detect low concentrations. We investigated five points to avoid peak tailing: 1) selection of a metal-free ODS column, 2) mobile phase pH and elution power selection, 3) chelating agent selection, 4) inert ESI capillary, and 5) inert LC pump and injector. A non-metal column resistant to highly basic mobile phases was chosen, and ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile were selected as the mobile phase to deprotonate the phosphate group of acyl-CoAs and avoid metal adsorption. Fused silica capillary was used as the ESI capillary, and a bioinert pump and injector were employed. The peak shapes of acyl-CoAs were significantly improved in the optimized conditions. Different extraction solvents were also investigated, and a mixture of acetonitrile, isopropanol, and phosphate buffer showed good coverage. This method was applied to Streptomyces coelicolor, and a total of twelve acyl-CoAs, including highly hydrophobic (C16) acyl-CoA, were detected. The LC-MS/MS analysis and extraction method showed good applicability.
