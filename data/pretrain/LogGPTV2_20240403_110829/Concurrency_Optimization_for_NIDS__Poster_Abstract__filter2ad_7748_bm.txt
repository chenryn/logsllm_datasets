PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jae Kwang Kim, Incheon National University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Tae Jin Kim, Hyejin Hyeon, Nam Il Park, Tae Gyu Yi, Sang Un Park, Yongsoo Choi, Jae Kwang Kim
To the best of our knowledge, none of the studies have conducted a comprehensive profiling of the primary and secondary metabolites in various 
phenotypes of pepper in relation to the stage of fruit maturity, nor did they have examined the metabolic networks by linking the large-scale 
metabolite data with metabolic pathways We performed metabolic profiling of phytochemicals, namely amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar 
alcohols, free phenolic acids, capsaicinoids, carotenoids, phytosterols, policosanols, tocopherols, volatiles, and fatty acids, in 13 pepper cultivars 
at different fruit maturity stages Our results comprised 10,218 data points resulting from three repetitions of 131 metabolites obtained from the fruit 
samples Next, the multivariate analysis (principal component analysis, PCA; Pearson’s correlation analysis; hierarchical clustering analysis, HCA) 
and PathVisio 330 were used with these data to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships among the metabolites and 
pepper samples In the mevalonic acid pathway, the content of phytosterols such as campesterol, beta-sitosterol, cholesterol, and stigmasterol were 
reduced in the fruit mature stage, thus confirming the negative correlation between carotenoids and tocopherols revealed by the PCA and HCA A 
complex carbon and nitrogen metabolic network was modulated by fruit ripening Correlation-based network analysis suggested that metabolism is 
substantially coordinated during the ripening

Regression model-based metabolomics approach to propose new quality marker for specialty coffee
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sastia P. Putri, Osaka University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Tomoya Irifune, Yusianto, Eiichiro Fukusaki
Specialty coffee is defined based on cupping scores of 10 attributes (fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, uniformity, balance, clean cup, 
sweetness, overall) in the protocol established by the Specialty Coffee Association of America Despite the increasing demand of specialty coffee, 
there are very few research on the relationship between component profile and specialty coffee quality Such study is important for further quality 
improvement of coffee Here, a regression model-based metabolomics approach was carried out to propose quality marker of specialty coffee 
A total of 97 hydrophilic low molecular weight compounds were detected in 10 specialty coffee samples by GC/MS-based component profiling 
Prediction models for 7 attributes (fragrance/aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, overall) and final score were constructed by Orthogonal 
Projection to Latent Structure regression analysis and these prediction models showed high performance (R2>09, Q2>09) Subsequently, 
important compounds for each attribute were proposed based on Variable Influence on Projection (VIP) This study proposed galactinol as a new 
candidate of quality marker of specialty coffee Galactinol was shown as the compound with the highest VIP in the prediction models of fragrance/
aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity and overall score Quantitation of galactinol in samples with lowest and highest score samples in the prediction 
model showed that there is a significant increase of galactinol concentration in which highest scoring sample (cupping score 8675) showed 8 times 
increase of galactinol concentration compared to lowest scoring sample (cupping score 8025) Identification of galactinol as a new quality marker 
would be useful for quality improvement of coffee

Metabolomics, an invaluable phenotyping tool in food science
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Melissa FItzgerald, University of Queensland, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Venea Dara Daygon, Sara Ghorbani Gorji, Crystal Concepcion, Lourdes Urban Andalete
The field of metabolomics developed over the years in chemistry laboratories However, over the past few years, the tools have become more 
available for routine use for phenotyping In addition, the stability and reproducibility of the tools enables the phenotyping datasets to be associated 
with other datasets collected with other omics data, such as lipidomics and genomics This enables us to complete the picture from the gene, its 
expression into a protein and the phenotype produced by the action of that protein As we develop new ideas to improve the flavour, taste and 
nutritional value of food, metabolomics and other omics platforms have provided invaluable data for transformational solutions to the food industry 
Metabolomics has enabled the discovery of different genes to improve the aroma of rice, different ways to provide natural ingredients to prolong the 
shelf-life of food, knowledge of how lipids impact the sensory properties of rice, and different ways to define rancidity based on volatile compounds 
We will report our discoveries for different foods, using mostly metabolomics, lipidomics and genomics platforms, and demonstrate the value of 
these discoveries to agriculture and food industries in Australia

Excessive carbohydrate intake is known as a major risk factor of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes Clinical application of biomarkers that 
reflect dietary intake is required for nutrition education In this study, we screened for biomarkers reflecting carbohydrate intake using a metabolomics 
approach One-week consecutive intake of white bread followed by similar intake of white rice for the same period was applied for 7 healthy volunteers 
Plasma samples were collected before and after each intervention, and non-targeted analysis using LC/MS was performed In partial least squares 
(PLS) analysis, we discriminated 4 groups, which revealed dynamic changes of metabolites reflecting white bread or rice intake To further investigate 
the biomarkers reflecting white bread intake, we compared PLS analyses to compare samples after the periods of bread intake or rice intake We 
screened for peaks in mass chromatogram that reflected white bread intake specifically Next, to ascertain whether these metabolites changed time-
dependently, we performed analysis using samples after single intake of white bread or white rice Plasma samples were collected 7 times over a 
period of 24 hours, and we found metabolites identical to those after 1-week intake It is likely that these include external metabolites derived from the 
food composition itself Thus, we found candidates for biomarkers that reflect carbohydrate intake such as white bread

Compositional assessment of genetically modified soybean containing thioredoxin-encoding gene
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ye Jin Kim, Incheon national university, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Young Jin Park, Ju-Seok Seo, Jung-Ho Park, Chang-Gi Kim, Jae Kwang Kim, Sung-Dug Oh
The development and cultivation of genetically modified organism (GMO) has been increased continuously over recent years As cosmetic materials, 
genetically modified (GM) soybean event CT-4025 was developed This soybean contains gene that encode thioredoxin (TRX) gene for improving 
skin whitening function In addition, the phosphinothricin-N-acetyltransferase gene was used as a selectable marker gene for glufosinate tolerance 
However, commercialization of the GM soybean requires the safety assessment Therefore, in this study, to assess compositional equivalence 
between GM soybeans (non-sprayed and sprayed with glufosinate) and non-transgenic soybeans, forty-six key nutrients (proximates, amino acids, 
fatty acids, isoflavones, vitamins and anti-nutrients) were analyzed The soybeans were cultivated in 2017 at two representative regions (Ochang 
and Jeonju) located in the Republic of Korea Statistical analysis was performed by using the linear model and principal component analysis (PCA) 
As a result, most of the analyzed components in the GM soybeans had non-significant differences compared with its non-transgenic soybean in the 
linear model A result of the PCA model showed that there was a clear discrimination between two regions rather than the soybean genotypes In 
a loading plot, the isoflavones such as malonyldaidzin, malonylglycitin, glycitin and genistin mainly contributed to separation between Ochang and 
Jeonju Consequently, these comparisons supported that CT-4025 is compositionally equivalent to the non-transgenic soybeans Furthermore, the 
results of this study could be a useful tool to investigate compositional similarities between GM and non-GM food

Differences in the metabolomic profile and microbial composition of soil supporting Burkea africana growth
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lufuno Ethel Nemadodzi, University of South Africa, South Africa
CO-AUTHORS: Jacques Vervoort, Gerhard Prinsloo
Burkea africana (Wild syringa) is a leguminous tree widely used for medicinal purposes, with a distribution in Namibia, Nigeria, Ethiopia as well 
as South Africa The trees are found and grow in clusters, on dry, acidic sandy soils impoverished from most nutrients with a particularly low 
phosphorus level The study determined the factors responsible for successful growth in nature of the Burkea africana trees as all efforts for 
commercial production has been proven unsuccessful An investigation was carried out to comprehend the metabolic profile, chemical composition 
and microbial composition of the soils where Burkea africana grows (Burkea soil) versus where it does not grow (non-Burkea soil) 1H-NMR 
metabolomic analysis showed different metabolites in the respective soils Trehalose, betaine, choline-like and carnitine-like compound, were found 
to be in higher concentration in the Burkea soils, whereas, acetate, lactate and formate were found to be more prevalent in the non-Burkea soils LC-
MS analysis revealed the presence of numerous amino acids such as aspartic acid and glutamine to be higher in the Burkea soils Deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) was extracted from the soil and subsequently sequenced A Basic Local Assignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to analyze the 
microbial diversity (bacterial and fungal) and composition found in both soils, for a comprehensive understanding of the soil composition Penicillum 
species was found to be prevalent in Burkea soils and was the main discriminant between the two soils The variances in fungal composition 
suggests that species supremacy play a role in development of Burkea africana trees

Profiling Glucosinolates Using LC-MS in Seeds of Camelina sativa L. Crantz
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Rong Zhou, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Canada
CO-AUTHORS: Ning Xu, Kevin C. Falk, Margaret Y.Gruber
Camelina sativa L Crantz, a member of Brassicaceae family, is heat and drought tolerant Thus it is thought to require fewer agronomic inputs 
and is a good alternative crop for marginal lands Its seed contains three glucosinolates: glucoarabin (9-(methylsulfinyl)nonylglucosinolate or 
GS9), glucocamelinin (10-(methylsulfinyl)decylglucosinolate or GS10) and 11-(methylsulfinyl)undecylglucosinolate or GS11) The structures of these 
glucosinolates are similar to that of glucoraphanin (4-(methylsulfinyl)-butylglucosinolate) The degradation product of glucoraphanin is thought 
to be an anti-cancer compound Glucosinolates were extracted and converted to desulfoglucosinolates based on AOCS Official Method Ak 1-92 
before analyzed by a Waters Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photodiode Array Detector-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-TQD) 
equipped with a BEH Shield RP18 column (21 x 50 mm; 17 µm) and held the initial conditions (100% water at 08 mL/min) for 03 minutes and then 
a linear solvent gradient of 0% to 25% acetonitrile (v/v) over the next 67 min The desulfoglucosinolates were quantified at 229 nm and identified 
by monitoring the characteristic loss of 1622 mass units using MS/MS constant neutral loss scans UPLC reduced the typical LC run time of 25-50 
minutes for camelina desulfoglucosinolates to 10 minutes and consumed 60% less acetonitrile The camelina accessions surveyed contained 21 - 31 
µmol glucosinolates per gram of seed: GS9 (46-70 µmol/g seeds), GS10 (137-202 µmol/g seeds) and GS11 (25-36 µmol/g seeds) Additionally, we 
identified several putative minor glucosinolates including 8-(methylsulfinyl)octyl glucosinlate (GS8) based on its mass spectrum Further work is 
needed to confirm the identity of the minor glucosinolates

Bitter Melon Triterpenoids Regulate Human Gut Microbiome and Potentially Benefit Metabolism Condition
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Jia Liu, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, China
Bitter melon, a widely cultivated vegetable and medicinal herb from Cucurbitaceae family, has been used as a botanical dietary supplement in 
Asia for treatment of dyslipidemic conditions, diabetes, and obesity The impact of bitter melon major components triterpenoids to gut microbiome 
was investigated The results showed that bitter melon triterpenoids (BMTs), including tetracyclic triterpenes and pentacyclic triterpenes, could 
influence gut microbiota, but the effects varied for different volunteers According to influence of microbiota, BMTs could be clustered While some 
of them showed much stronger effect Proportions of some beneficial bacteria were significantly promoted by BMTs; meanwhile, proportions of 
opportunistic pathogens were considerably decreased Moreover, BMTs influenced the bile acids metabolism After treatment, concentration of the 
TGR5 agonists and Farnesoid X Receptor antagonist bile acids increased, which indicated an increase of glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion After 
component analysis of bitter melon from different regions, we found that proportions of pentacyclic triterpenes in bitter melons from Guangdong 
were significantly higher than that from Shandong and Hunan Since different BMTs influenced microbiota condition and bile acid metabolism 
diversely, the influences of bitter melons with different chemotypes could vary In conclusion, bitter melons could benefit to treatment of metabolic 
disorders through the influence to microbiota

Metabolomic mapping of chemodiversity in microbial strains using NMR and multivariate statistical process control (MSPC)  
to find potential biomarkers
PRESENTING AUTHOR: John Gauvin, DSM, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Abel Folch Fortuny, Margriet Hendriks, Adriana Carvalho de Souza, Peter van de Vondervoort
NMR has become an established technique for use in metabolic profiling, delivering information on a broad range of compound classes at various 
concentrations In proton NMR many compounds give multiple signals within the proton spectrum, which can be used in statistical analysis to detect 
patterns in multivariate approaches In a novel approach, we used the metabolic profiles of microbial strains to build a MSPC-based model to find 
possible biomarkers from the chemodiversity portrayed in spectra MSPC has been used within industrial processes with many complex parameters 
and strongly multivariate data, to detect and diagnose deviations in incoming production batches MSPC can be used to build a model from the “non-
hits”, considering them as the normal operating conditions results Then, “hits” can be projected in the model and analyzed as outlier observations 
(since they were hits) Finally, in this work a MSPC-based model was created to map and distinguish biomarkers from general metabolites

Metabolic engineering of Ustilago trichophora TZ1 for the improvement of malic acid production from glycerol using 
metabolomics approaches
PRESENTING AUTHOR: An Phan, RWTH Aachen, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: An N.T. Phan, Lisa Prigolovkin, Lars M. Blank
U trichophora has attracted increasing attention due to their capability in using glycerol, the main waste streams of biodiesel production process, to 
produce malic acid Unlike other commercial filamentous fungi that tend to form pellets during cultivation, Ustilaginaceae can stay haploid and non-
filamentous, which are the vital features for industrial applications Previous optimizations could achieve the strain U trichophora TZ1, which has the 
highest reported malic acid titre for microbial production from glycerol Though, the production yield was quite low The main obstacle for further 
strain improvement is the lack of knowledge on U trichophora metabolic network In this study, we aim to decipher and reconstruct the metabolic 
network in U trichophora TZ1 to improve malic acid production using GCMS-based metabolomics Metabolites in central carbon metabolic pathways 
were identified and quantified during malic acid production phase As a results, the main by-product formation pathways in malic acid production 
from glycerol were revealed By using metabolic engineering and medium optimization, we could decrease the level of by-products and successfully 
improve malic acid production in U trichophora TZ1

LC/MS-based metabolomics analysis for the improvement of 1-butanol production in engineered cyanobacterial 
Synechococcus elongatus
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Artnice Fathima, Osaka University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Artnice Mega, Derrick Chuang, Walter Laviña, James Liao, Sastia Putri, Eiichiro Fukusaki
Sustainable 1-butanol production using photosynthetic organisms, such as cyanobacteria, has garnered interest among researchers 1-Butanol 
is natively produced via CoA-dependent pathway in Clostridia species Therefore, a cyanobacterial, Synechococcus elongatus strain capable 
of producing 1-butanol, named BUOHSE, was developed by introducing a modified CoA-dependent pathway However, 1-butanol production in 
this strain is low compared to other model microorganisms Metabolomics approach for strain improvement has been widely employed in various 
microorganisms, which enables rapid detection of important metabolites and rate-limiting steps in the production pathway Thus, comparative 
metabolome analysis of cyanobacteria strains producing 1-butanol was performed to further improve 1-butanol titer By using ion-pair reversed-
phase LC/MS, the reaction from butanoyl-CoA to butanal, catalyzed by PduP enzyme, was considered as a rate-limiting step Accordingly, a new 
strain DC7 with an improved activity of PduP was developed This strain showed a 33% increase in 1-butanol titer and a decreased level of butanoyl-
CoA, indicating that butanoyl-CoA to butanal reaction was improved To understand the effect of PduP optimization, metabolome analysis of DC7 
and BUOHSE was carried out Results showed acetyl-CoA was highly accumulated in DC7 compared to BUOHSE To utilize this enhanced level of 
acetyl-CoA for 1-butanol formation in DC7, acetyl-CoA carboxylase was overexpressed The resulting strain DC11 was able to reach a production 
titer of 4187 mg/L in 6 days, cutting production time in half In conclusion, metabolomics-assisted strain improvement employed in this study 
demonstrated the utility of metabolomics to effectively find a rate-limiting step and target for improvement in a biosynthesis pathway

GC-MS metabolic profiling of volatile compounds produced by Actinobacteria
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Lada Brazdova, Institute of Microbiology, Czech Republic
CO-AUTHORS: Bara Seidlova, Zdenek Kamenik
Actinobacteria, particularly the genera Streptomyces, Amycolatopsis, Rhodococcus, and others, are important producers of bioactive metabolites 
including antimicrobials, antitumor agents, immunosuppressants, or signaling molecules However, the mainstream research tends to focus 
on compounds, which are suitable for liquid chromatography, while volatile compounds may be missed unless they are analyzed by gas 
chromatography We cultured various Actinobacteria strains with novel gene clusters including those encoding biosynthesis of new compounds 
with 4-alkyl-L-proline moieties We determined the profile of volatile compounds by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry and processed the 
data using various approaches including GNPS molecular networking for GC-MS data

LC-MS/MS and GC-MS metabolomics identifies feedstock components inhibitory to growth of engineered microbial strains
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mona Elbadawi-Sidhu, Amyris, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Chia-Wei Lu, Perry Kumagai, Quinn Mitrovich, Judith Denery
Amyris strives to deliver high-quality, renewable products from sustainable resources, including cellulosic sugars To achieve this, advanced 
microbial engineering coupled with state-of-the-art analytics are innovatively implemented to propel industrial synthetic biology and manufacturing 
of eight new renewable products in the past ten years Targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics promotes data-driven 
strain and process design that enables manufacturing of our products One application of these approaches focused on development of strains 
capable of thriving on wood-derived cellulosic feedstocks The conversion of wood into microbially-consumable monosaccharides produces a 
variety of side products that inhibit growth of highly engineered yeast strains To better characterize the compounds affecting engineered strains, 
metabolomics was used to elucidate the complex composition of the feedstock Polar and non-polar chromatography methods coupled to both 
LC-MS/MS and GC-MS were used to broaden the scope of the metabolic profiles A multi-pronged approach was applied to determine the identities 
of the inhibitors: bioassay-guided fractionation of hydrolysate and spent hydrolysate informed the untargeted analysis, which in turn informed 
the targeted analysis, along with literature search of known feedstock components Using untargeted metabolomics, we identified six novel 
components of cellulosic hydrolysate In total, 70 compounds were tested, and we found that a combination of 26 metabolites could account for the 
total observed growth inhibition of the Amyris yeast A summary of the analytical workflow and biological impact is presented

Intracellular metabolite profiling and the optimization of metabolome extraction methods for Clostridium carboxidivorans 
fermenting syngas
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yu Eun Cheong, Korea University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Jungyeon Kim, Kyoung Heon Kim
Clostridium carboxidivorans, which ferments CO to biofuels via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, has received increased attention Since CO is a 
unique substrate and is known to be metabolized via metabolisms different from other common carbon sources such as glucose, it is necessary 
to analyze intracellular metabolite profiles for CO fermentation by C carboxidivorans to suggest clues for metabolic engineering Moreover, when 
fermenting syngas, the metabolite profiles of C carboxidivorans can be quite different from those under the normal conditions Therefore, it is 
essential to optimize the metabolite extraction solvent for syngas-fermenting C carboxidivorans In comparison with glucose media, CO-containing 
syngas media allowed higher levels of intracellular fatty acid synthesis and changes of fatty acid metabolism possibly due to cofactor imbalance 
The high levels of intracellular fatty acids could be used to produce high-value chemicals by further microbial engineering Also, the evaluation of 
extraction solvents revealed that the mixture of water-isopropanol-methanol (2:2:5, v/v/v) is the best extraction solvent, which showed a higher 
extraction capability and reproducibility than pure methanol, the conventional extraction solvent for clostridia This is the first metabolomic study to 
demonstrate the unique metabolite profiles of CO fermentation, and the mixture of water-isopropanol-methanol as the optimal metabolite extraction 
solvent for C carboxidivorans fermenting CO

Development of LC-MS/MS based acyl-CoAs analysis method and its application to Streptomyces coelicolor
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Katsuaki Nitta, Osaka University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Masahiro Furuno, Sastia Prama Putri, Eriko Takano, Eiichiro Fukusaki
Acyl-CoAs are important intermediates in central carbon metabolism, fatty acids metabolism and other important pathways In addition, secondary 
metabolism such as polyketide antibiotics synthesis also utilizes acyl-CoAs for intermediate elongation Hence, a comprehensive analysis platform 
of acyl-CoAs is necessary to facilitate above pathway intermediate analysis One of challenges of acyl-CoAs analysis is strong interaction of acyl-
CoAs with metal part of LC-MS system and this results in strong peak tailing in liquid chromatography Consequently this makes it impossible to 
detect low concentration of acyl-CoAs In this study, the following five points were investigated to avoid the peak tailing: 1) metal free ODS column 
selection, 2) mobile phase pH and elution power selection, 3) chelating agent selection, 4) to inert ESI capillary, 5) to inert LC pomp and injector 
In summary, non-metal column, which is resistant to highly basic mobile phase, was chosen for sustainable analysis while ammonium bicarbonate 
and acetonitrile was chosen as mobile phase to deprotonate the phosphate group of acyl-CoAs and avoid metal adsorption To reduce metal part 
of LC-MS, fused silica capillary was employed as ESI capillary In addition, bioinert pump and injector was employed The peak shapes of acyl-CoAs 
were improved significantly in the optimized condition In addition, different extraction solvents were investigated to achieve better coverage and 
mixture of acetonitrile, isopropanol & phosphate buffer showed good coverage It was applied to Streptomyces coelicolor A total twelve acyl-
CoAs including highly hydrophobic(C16) acyl-CoA were detected and the LC-MS/MS analysis and extraction method showed good applicability to
