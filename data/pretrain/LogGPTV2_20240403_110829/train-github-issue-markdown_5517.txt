##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
run_once  
delegate_to
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.3.0.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
      python version = 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10) [GCC 5.4.0 20160609]
##### CONFIGURATION
Nothing notable changed.
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A (but using Ubuntu 16.0.4.2 for both)
##### SUMMARY
I recently updated Ansible to 2.3.0.0 and several tasks that use a run_once:
true with delegate_to: 127.0.0.1 are now being skipped. I've included an
example below which used to run as long as at least one host was valid (not
skipped). Now the play is skipped regardless when run_once: true.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Including the task below with one skipped host and one valid host on Ansible
2.3.0.0 results in the task being skipped altogether for me. Changing it to
run_once: false allows it to process with first host being skipped and the
other triggering it. The issue seems similar to this old (closed) issue --
#9784
"As run_once will always target the first host in the list, if that host is
supposed to skip a set of tasks (due to some condition, for instance), it will
also skip any run_once tasks even though they may delegate_to other hosts
which are willing to run that task."
    - name: Clone XXXXXXX locally for v{{ _current_version }}
      git:
        repo: 'PI:EMAIL:group/project.git'
        dest: '{{ _local_repobase }}/{{ _current_version }}'
        depth: 1
        update: yes
        version: 'v{{ _current_version }}'
      run_once: true
      delegate_to: 127.0.0.1
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Task should run once on the local host
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Task is skipped.
