ABSTRACT
Top search ad placement is the coin of today’s Internet services
realm. An entire industry of search engine marketing companies
have emerged to help advertisers optimize their ad campaigns to de-
liver high returns on investment, peddling a plethora of advertising
strategies. Yet, very little is publicly known about the effectiveness
of online search advertising, especially when trying to compare the
various campaign strategies used by advertisers.
This paper presents the ﬁrst
large-scale measurement of
the effectiveness—measured in terms of incremental conversion
gains—of online search ads. We develop a simple metric called
net acquisition beneﬁt (NAB) that admits comparisons between the
efﬁcacy of different ad campaign strategies without access to ad-
vertisers’ private ﬁnancial information. We study three common
campaign strategies used by advertisers on a large search ad net-
work: cannibalization, poaching, and ad extensions. Considering
data from a month in the last two years, we employ NAB to iden-
tify cases where these campaign strategies are justiﬁed. Advertisers
and ad agencies can replicate our methodology to apply it to other
strategies of interest.

INTRODUCTION
Measuring the effectiveness of advertising is, in general, a hard
problem. As John Wanamaker famously quipped, “half the money
I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which
half.” Online search advertising holds out the promise of address-
ing this longstanding challenge by focusing spend on the right con-
sumers at the right time. The sheer scale of ﬁne-grained, user-
activity data that can be brought to bear (e.g., tracking every ad
click and every user action on advertisers’ site) allows advertisers
to reach populations of particular interest. Moreover, search queries
capture the intent of the user allowing more direct connections be-
tween the ad and the user action [26]. This tight relationship con-
trasts with traditional brand advertising where connections between
ads and purchases are more nebulous. Hence, it is no surprise that
search advertising accounts for over 40% of the $42 billion spent
in online ads in the US alone, and is growing at 18% annually [25].
Despite its ever-increasing prevalence, very little is publicly
known about the effectiveness of online search advertising. Indeed,
large advertisers have presented conﬂicting anecdotal evidence. As
recently as in April 2013, a study claimed that the estimated $51
million eBay spends on search ads is ineffective since they essen-
tially cannibalize clicks from organic search results: in the absence
of eBay’s ad the user would have clicked the eBay page in the
organic results [10]. Similarly, three Indian online apparel retail-
ers found that poaching each other’s users by advertising on their
competitors’ brand names was counterproductive; while they might
succeed in getting their competitors’ customers to click their ad, the
customers would typically not convert. For the few customers who
do end up making a purchase, the cost paid by the advertiser is too
high [7]. Despite these reports, ad networks and ad agencies main-
tain that poaching and cannibalizing organic clicks both have a net
positive return on investment [7]. Opinions are similarly mixed
in the mobile space, where many advertisers complain about acci-
dental clicks while ad networks defend the effectiveness of mobile
search ads [4, 6].
One factor contributing to these seemingly contradictory reports
is the current inability of anyone other than the advertisers them-
selves to determine if a particular advertising campaign is effec-
tive. Publishers and marketing ﬁrms deal in terms of metrics like
click-through ratio (CTR), which reports the number of clicks on
an ad as a fraction of the number of times the ad is shown, and cost
per acquisition (CPA), which reports an advertiser’s total spend di-
vided by the number of resulting purchases. Unfortunately, nei-
ther of these metrics lends insight to the key question—namely
whether a particular advertising campaign is proﬁtable for the ad-
vertiser or not, which is captured by the metric proﬁt per impression
(PPI). However, determining an ad campaign’s PPI fundamentally
requires knowledge of an advertiser’s cost and revenue structure—

information they are likely loathe to share, even with their market-
ing agencies.
Instead, we present a simple metric—net acquisition beneﬁt
(NAB)—that leverages information about how much an advertiser
bids for ad placement (which, for rational advertisers, is a lower
bound on the proﬁt they expect) to estimate proﬁt per impression
(PPI). Using data about billions of clicks from a large search ad
network we conduct a month-long measurement study of the effec-
tiveness of three search ad campaign strategies—cannibalization,
poaching, and ad extensions—that are widely employed by adver-
tisers today.
We ﬁnd that the advertising landscape is quite nuanced: a given
campaign strategy may be effective for some advertisers but not
others. For instance, advertisers with well-established brands may
ﬁnd little beneﬁt in advertising on search queries mentioning their
brand, while less well-known brands may need to do so to pro-
tect themselves from competitors looking to poach their customers.
Similarly, ads on mobile devices may be more effective for busi-
nesses with brick-and-mortar storefronts than for businesses with
purely online presence. We hope that NAB will allow not only
advertisers but ad agencies and other third parties to replicate our
methodology to measure and compare other advertising strategies.
2. BACKGROUND
This section provides a brief overview of search advertising and
related concepts. Readers already familiar with search ads may
prefer to skip ahead and refer back to this section as needed.
Search ads and organic results. When a user types a search
query into a search engine like Google, Bing, or Yahoo!, the result-
ing page contains two types of listings. Organic search results—
traditionally understood to be the search results—are determined
by the search engine through proprietary heuristic algorithms; the
listed websites do not pay the search engine for placement or click-
throughs. Paid search results, on the other hand, which we refer
to as search ads, are typically sold by the search engine through
an auction mechanism where the destination website (i.e., adver-
tiser) bids for inclusion. The top paid search results are typically
displayed alongside organic search results and formatted to look
similar except for, e.g., a slightly different background shade, or a
‘Sponsored’ or ‘Ad’ label.
Content. The content of an ad includes at a minimum a title, the
advertiser’s domain name, and two short lines of descriptive text,
typically rendered in blue, green, and black, respectively as illus-
trated in Figure 1. The advertiser also provides the URL the user
should be directed to if the ad is clicked. Search engines increas-
ingly support ad extensions that allow advertisers to include addi-
tional information or actions in the rendered ad. The call extension,
for instance, allows an advertiser to provide a phone number; when
the ad is shown on a mobile phone, the extension is rendered as a
button that invokes the dialer as shown in Figure 1(b).
Targeting. Advertisers select individual keywords or phrases
that must be present in the (normalized) user search query for the
ad to be included in the ad auction. User search queries are normal-
ized to ﬁx misspellings, stem words, and resolve ambiguities using
various heuristics. The advertiser may further target their ad by de-
vice type, geographic region, time of day, and user demographics.
Targeting is often quite ﬁne-grained in practice, with top advertis-
ers managing tens of millions of keywords [10].
Campaigns and pricing. Ads are priced through an auction
mechanism that is designed to encourage advertisers to bid the
maximum amount they are willing to pay for a click. The amount
the advertiser is charged if the ad is clicked is based on the
next-lower-ranked bid in a form of generalized second-price auc-
tion [20]. The position of the ad on the results page is based on
some function of the bid and the probability the ad will be clicked
(e.g., based on historical click-through rates). Advertisers typically
manage bids for a group of related keywords and targeting criteria
through a logical construct called a campaign. Each bid is associ-
ated with a particular ad campaign, which can specify ﬁne-grained
bid modiﬁcations based upon device type and individual keywords.
Conversion. The purpose of an ad is obviously to drive revenue
to the advertiser. Conversion (or equivalently, acquisition) refers
to the user performing some desirable action on the advertiser’s
site after clicking the ad, e.g., signing up for a newsletter, purchas-
ing a product, or subscribing to a service. Sophisticated search-ad
networks assist advertisers in monitoring the effectiveness of their
campaigns by providing support for analytics.
In particular, the
advertiser can inform the search-ad network of a conversion event
by placing JavaScript code provided by the search-ad network on
the page on which the conversion happens. The JavaScript directs
the browser to contact the search-ad network’s server with a user
cookie which can then be used to link the conversion event to any
previous user actions performed on the search-ad network. The ad-
vertiser can track campaign performance along different types of
conversions by passing an opaque tag to the conversion JavaScript;
the search-ad network typically does not learn the semantics of the
tag or the value of the conversion and simply tallies the counts of
these opaque tags for the campaign.
3. METRIC
In this section we present NAB, a simple metric we use for mea-
suring the effectiveness of online search ads. Our primary goal is
to design a metric that can be used by ad networks, ad agencies,
or any entity that manages large search advertising campaigns. We
discuss the challenges in choosing the right metric to measure the
performance of ad campaigns. In particular, we address the fact that
details of customer transactions (e.g., proﬁt margins) may not be
available to the entities running the search engine marketing cam-
paigns for the advertisers.
3.1 Challenges
Our choice of metric for comparing the performance of different
advertising strategies is driven by the following challenges.
3.1.1 Advertiser diversity
Advertisers on our partner ad network span orders of magnitude
in terms of their scale. The effective cost per acquisition (CPA) for
an advertiser, computed as the total amount charged divided by the
total number of conversions, is a rough proxy for the monetary util-
ity the advertiser expects to derive from advertising [21]. Figure 2
plots the normalized CPA for advertisers reporting at least 10 con-
version events in our dataset vs. the total normalized money spent
by the advertiser; the values are normalized to the median value
along each axis. (Because each advertiser has at least 10 conver-
sions, there can be no points above the CPA = TotalSpend/10
diagonal.) As one might expect, different advertisers have vastly
different budgets. Both the total money spent by advertisers (x-
axis domain) and effective cost-per-acquisition (y-axis range) span
80by device type may help evaluate the effectiveness of advertising
on mobile devices, while aggregating data by query classiﬁcation
to, e.g., consider only ads placed on competitors’ brand names, may
help evaluate the impact of poaching.
3.2 Net acquisition beneﬁt (NAB)
Intuitively, the net acquisition beneﬁt (NAB) is the conversion
probability of a trafﬁc slice adjusted by its cost. We deﬁne NAB
for a trafﬁc slice x as follows:
NAB(x) = πx − νx
λ
,
where:
x, n : Trafﬁc slice x consisting of n impressions
= Conversion probability, i.e., #conversions
πx
= Average cost, i.e., cost
νx
n
= Advertiser’s target cost-per-acquisition
λ
n
λ is the maximum amount an advertiser would be willing to pay
for a conversion, which is well captured, for example, by their bid
in an ad auction (see Section 2). Obviously, a rational advertiser
would not want to pay more for an ad than they stand to make in
proﬁt on the conversion, so we argue that λ serves as a lower bound
for the proﬁt an advertiser expects to capture from a conversion.
Note that if λ precisely equals the advertiser’s proﬁt margin, then
NAB is proportional to proﬁt per impression (PPI).
