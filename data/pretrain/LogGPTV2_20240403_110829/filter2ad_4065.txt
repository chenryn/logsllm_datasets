ABSTRACT
We propose the notion of disavowable public key encryption
with non-interactive opening (disavowable PKENO) where,
for a ciphertext and a message, the receiver of the ciphertext
can issue a proof that the plaintext of the ciphertext is NOT
the message, and give a fairly practical construction.

INTRODUCTION
The primitive public key encryption with non-interactive
opening (PKENO) [1] is a class of public key encryption with
additional functionality. By using this, a user can prove
that a ciphertext is an encryption of a certain message and
it is publicly veriﬁed. In some situation that a user needs
to claim that a ciphertext is NOT decrypted to a certain
message, if he proves the fact by using PKENO, the real
message of the ciphertext is revealed and a veriﬁer checks
that it is diﬀerent from the certain message about which
the user wants to prove. However, this naive solution is
problematic in terms of privacy. For example, a customer
of a store is required to prove that he did not buy a certain

In this paper, we propose the notion of disavowable
PKENO and give a concrete instantiation. This primitive
allows a receiver to prove that a given ciphertext C under
his/her public key pk is NOT decrypted to a certain message
m
without revealing his/her secret key sk . More precisely, a
receiver runs the DProve algorithm on inputs his secret key
0
sk , a ciphertext C, and a message m
, thereby generating
a proof (cid:25) (we call it “disavowal proof”), and a veriﬁer runs
the DVer algorithm on inputs receiver’s public key pk , C,
, and (cid:25). The algorithm DVer outputs 1 if C is NOT an
m
encryption of m
and 0 otherwise. To construct a concrete
scheme, it seems hard to avoid to use non-interactive zero-
knowledge (NIZK) proofs since a simulator needs to generate
disavowal proofs for the challenge ciphertext. Thus, our at-
tempt is to use the eﬃcient NIZK proof system proposed by
Groth and Sahai [2]. However, the language of the Groth-
Sahai NIZK proof has a limitation. Moreover, disavowable
PKENO needs to support to prove the invalidity of cipher-
= ?. We overcome these diﬃculties
texts, i.e., the case of m
by using public veriﬁability of Kiltz’s tag-based encryption
scheme [3] (whose plaintext space is a base group). Our
proposed scheme is provably secure in the standard model
under the decisional linear assumption and strong unforge-
ability of one-time signature. Also, it is fairly practical since
the disavowal proof consists of 61 group elements. The de-
tailed construction is given in the full version of this paper.
