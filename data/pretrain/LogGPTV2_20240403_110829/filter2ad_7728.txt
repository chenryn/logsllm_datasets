ABSTRACT 
In recent years, with the rapid development of satellite technology 
including  On  Board  Processing  (OBP)  and  Inter  Satellite  Link 
(ISL),  satellite  network  devices  such  as  space  IP  routers  have 
been  experimentally  carried  in  space.  However,  there  are  many 
difficulties  to  build  a  future  satellite  network  with  current 
terrestrial  Internet  technologies  due  to  the  distinguished  space 
features,  such  as 
limited  resources,  remote 
hardware/software  upgrade  in  space.  In  this  paper,  we  propose 
OpenSAN,  a  novel  architecture  of  software-defined  satellite 
network.  By  decoupling  the  data  plane  and  control  plane, 
OpenSAN  provides  satellite  network  with  high  efficiency,  fine-
grained control, as well as flexibility to support future advanced 
network technology. Furthermore, we also discuss some practical 
challenges in the deployment of OpenSAN.

In recent years, the development of satellite technologies such 
as OBP and ISL has greatly promoted the development of satellite 
network [1]. The traditional approach of satellite network is bent 
pipe,  which  means  that  all  the  packets  are  transmitted  from 
transmission terminal to an intermediate station, and then relayed 
to 
the 
architecture  of  satellite  payload,  but  leads  to  a  long  latency 
because of two-hop communication. The OBP  indicates  that  the 
satellite payload has the capabilities to support signal regeneration, 
packet  switching  and  so  on.  Compared  with  Bent  Pipe,  OBP 
enhances 
the 
communication time. There are two types of OBP according to its 
orbits. One is GEO, such as IRIS. The IRIS JCTD placed an IP 
router payload on a Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite to 
accelerate network-centric capabilities in space [2]. It has a great 
improvement  in  the  delay  compared  with  bent  pipe  technology. 
The  other  one  is  Low  Earth  Orbit  (LEO)/  Medium  Earth  Orbit

(MEO),  such  as  Teledesic.  Teledesic  is  a  constellation  of  Low 
Earth  Orbit  (LEO)  communication  satellites  connected  by  ISL. 
The  advantage  of  LEO  with  OBP  is  small  delay  and  full 
connectivity,  but  it  makes  the  management  and  routing  more 
complex [3]. Since the OBP supports on-board switching and the 
satellites connect with each other by ISL, applying the mature and 
future  advanced  technologies  of  terrestrial  Internet  to  satellite 
network become possible.  
However, there are many difficulties to build a future satellite 
network  with  current  terrestrial  Internet  technologies.  (1)  The 
resources of satellite nodes are severely limited. (2) The satellite 
network is closed and scheduled, so the maintenance, upgrade and 
expansion  of  satellite  network  are  difficult.  (3)  As  the  topology 
changes  frequently,  it  is  difficult  to  maintain  the  stability  of 
satellite  network.  The  static  routing  algorithm  used  in  satellite 
network which is called snapshot is inflexible and lacks the ability 
of  fault  tolerance.  However,  the  dynamic  routing  algorithm  is 
resource-consuming.  Therefore,  it  requires  a  mechanism  to 
balance the flexibility and cost. (4) The number of new services 
and  applications  increases  fast,  but  the  satellite  payload  cannot 
identify various kinds of new services. 
To  address  the  above  issues,  we  propose  OpenSAN,  a  novel 
architecture of software-defined satellite network. By decoupling 
the data plane and control plane of each satellite [4], OpenSAN 
provides satellite network with efficiency, fine-grained control, as 
well as flexibility to support future advanced network technology.  
2.  AN OVERVIEW OF OPENSAN  
The  overview  of  our  software-defined  satellite  network 
architecture is shown in Fig. 1. It contains three parts: Data Plane 
(Satellite  infrastructure,  terminal  router),  Control  Plane  (GEO 
Group) and Management Plane (Network Operations and Control 
Center). 
Figure 1. The Architecture of OpenSAN 
3472.1  Data Plane: Satellite infrastructure 
The  data  plane  consists  of  the  terminal  router  distributed 
around  the  world  and  the  multi-layered  satellite  infrastructure 
(such  as  GEO,  MEO,  LEO).  The  satellites  and  routers  run  flow 
table  “match-action”  protocol  and  focus  on  packets  forwarding. 
The  protocol  matches  the  header  of  each  packet  such  as  IP 
address,  port  and  user-defined  segment  to  support  forwarding, 
multicast,  virtual  network,  access  management,  IPv6  and  so  on. 
The multi-layered satellite network has distinguished features. For 
example, the GEO satellite has a long delay but its link is reliable. 
On the contrary, the delay of LEO satellite is short. Therefore by 
choosing different routes, the multi-layered satellite network can 
guarantee the QoS of various services. 
Since  OpenSAN  decouples  the  satellite  and  router  from  the 
control  plane,  the  data  plane  is  more  flexible  and  controllable 
based  on  fine-grained  flow  table.  And  it  also  makes  the  device 
tend to be standard and decreases the cost. 
2.2  Control Plane: GEO Group 
Due to the ability of reliable link, wide coverage, broadcasting 
and  stationary  to  the  ground,  the  GEO  satellite  is  suitable  to 
control the data plane. As three GEO satellites can cover the earth, 
the GEO Group consists of at least three GEO satellites to cover 
the whole data plane. GEO Group is a logically centralized entity 
which focuses on 1) translating the rules from management plane 
to the data plane, 2) monitoring the satellite network's status (link 
status, network traffic, different flow status) information through 
CDPI interface, and then sending to the management plane for an 
abstract  view  of  the  satellite  network.  Compared  with  the 
traditional  satellite  monitoring  and  control  system,  OpenSAN 
reduces the number of ground stations and simplifies the process 
of control flow. 
As shown in Fig. 2, there are three topologies of GEO Group 
distinguished by reliability and complexity. In Fig. 2(a), the GEO 
controllers  communicate  with  NOCC  via  a  primary  GEO,  this 
topology is suited to a small scale of data plane. In Fig. 2(b), the 
topology  chooses  a  primary  Ground  Station  to  centralized  relay 
the packets,  which  reduces  the  burden  of  primary  GEO.  And  in 
Fig.  2(c),  the  topology  increases  the  reliability  by  distributed 
NOCCs,  but  it  requires  a  protocol  to  keep  the  consistency  of 
satellite network. 
applications,  such  as  routing  policy  calculation,  virtualization, 
security,  resources  utilization  and  mobility  management.  The 
applications depend on the satellite network's status provided by 
GEO  Group.  For  example,  when  a  mobile  terminal  joins  the 
network, NOCC has to recalculate routing policy and translate the 
new flow table down to data plane. 
3.  PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS 
The  centralized  topology  of  OpenSAN  has  a  significant 
progress  in  decreasing  the  link  bandwidth  compared  with  the 
traditional dynamic routing protocols. For example, OSPF routing 
)O n  packets,  n  is the number of routers.  All 
protocol sends 
link  states  are  broadcasted  to  every  router  and  each  of  them 
calculates the route based on the Dijkstra algorithm. In OpenSAN, 
the GEO Group needs to collect the status of data plane, and the 
NOCC performs routing calculation. Then it broadcasts the route 
updates to the data plane leading to a 
( )O n  cost.

4.  DYNAMIC SDN CONTROL STRATEGY 
Different  from  traditional  fixed  or  mobile  networks,  the 
satellites (mainly LEO) in the Data Plane run quickly around the 
earth,  which  makes  the  topology  of  the  whole  network  change 
frequently.  And  another  problem  is  that  the  user  traffic  changes 
with  the  time  and  location.  All  these  characteristics  of  satellite 
network pose challenges to the present SDN control strategy. 
Fortunately,  the  satellite  is  regular  and  predictable.  So  the 
applications  and  controller  can  predict  the  status  of  the  whole 
network.  In  OpenSAN,  we  can  use  prediction-based  algorithm 
such as neural network to aware the change of the whole network. 
Combining with back-up flow table, it can avoid the disruption of 
service. And we will further explore the design of NBI and CDPI 
to achieve a reliable and efficient control path.
