User: I'm kinda new to programming, and I wanna write a simple program that needs to OCR a particular window. Currently, I'm using (w.GetForegroundWindow()), but that gets me the current window which would always be the Python shell, since that is the one that is active when I run it, even if it is for a split second only. 
After searching around for a bit, I found the .Getwindows function, but not much of it on Python. What does it do, and what are the parameters? Will i be able to target a particular process (=window) with it? If not, what can I use then?
This is using the pywin32 module on Python 2.7 in Windows

I'm in Windows, Python 2.7 . The GetWindows function comes with the module pywin32, if im not wrong
Assistant: The usual way is to call EnumWindows with a callback and then get information about each hwnd - for example name, title or window class. Check that against what you are looking for and save the matched hwnd. After EnumWindows returns, check that you found a valid hwnd and use that for your program.
It's not pleasant - there's not much support for this kind of thing in windows. I've heard that using accessibility features is better but I have no experience using that.
