To effectively implement CIS Control 15.2, which focuses on establishing and maintaining a service provider management policy, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **Develop a Comprehensive Policy:**
   - Create a detailed service provider management policy that outlines the processes for classifying, inventorying, assessing, monitoring, and decommissioning service providers.
   - Ensure the policy aligns with the organization's overall security and risk management strategies.

2. **Classification and Inventory:**
   - Classify service providers based on the type of services they provide and the level of access to sensitive information or critical systems.
   - Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all service providers, including their contact information, the services they provide, and the data they have access to.

3. **Assessment and Monitoring:**
   - Regularly assess service providers to ensure they meet the organization's security requirements and comply with relevant regulations.
   - Implement continuous monitoring mechanisms to track the performance and security posture of service providers.

4. **Decommissioning:**
   - Establish clear procedures for decommissioning service providers, including the secure removal of access and the return or destruction of any organizational data.
   - Ensure that decommissioning processes are documented and followed consistently.

5. **Review and Update:**
   - Review and update the service provider management policy at least annually or whenever significant changes occur in the organization that could impact the policy.
   - Involve key stakeholders, such as legal, compliance, and IT teams, in the review process to ensure the policy remains effective and aligned with organizational needs.

By following these procedures, organizations can effectively manage their service providers and enhance their overall security posture.
