### Configuring Connectors for External Application Interaction

Properly configuring connectors is essential for workflow systems to interact with external applications. These systems typically offer a variety of connector types, including those for databases, flat files, spreadsheets, websites, and ERP systems. When specific connectors are needed but not provided by the workflow system, they can be developed using dedicated development tools.

### 4. Framework Evaluation and Future Work

#### 4.1 Framework Evaluation

Recognizing that a one-size-fits-all design method cannot meet the diverse needs of organizations, we present an evaluation of the Poseidon framework. This evaluation addresses the set of requirements outlined in Section 2.1.

**Simplicity and Ease of Use:**
During the process design at Phantom Works, the R&D unit of The Boeing Company, we tested several methods to capture knowledge from non-technical personnel. These methods ranged from textual descriptions of processes, activities, control flows, and business variables to formal representations using graph-based visual notations. The textual method was overly descriptive and difficult for managers and staff to understand, while the formal method was too complex for non-technical users. After experimenting with various approaches, we found that a table interrelating business variables and activities (i.e., tasks) was more effective. This approach, known as the business case table, was well-received due to its simplicity and ease of use.

**Business Process Size:**
The framework has been successfully applied to small and medium-sized processes. We believe it is also suitable for large processes, although we have not yet had the opportunity to model such processes.

**Business Process Structure:**
At Phantom Works, the framework was used to develop administrative processes, including the Travel Request Authorization (Cardoso and Bussler 1999). This process serves as a reference model for travel requests and met all initial requirements. Additionally, the framework automatically optimized the process by identifying tasks that could be executed in parallel rather than sequentially.

**Degree of Automation:**
The Poseidon framework consists of two main phases: the participative phase and the analytical phase. The participative phase involves collaborative workshops where CEOs, managers, and staff work together to develop a process design. The analytical phase uses automated techniques to model and derive the process design. The results from the participative phase are automatically transferred to the analytical phase, which is fully automated and hides technical details from end-users.

#### 4.2 Future Work

##### 4.2.1 Quality of Service (QoS)

An important requirement for business processes is the management of Quality of Service (QoS). In modern markets, such as e-commerce, QoS management allows organizations to align their vision with their business processes more efficiently. Appropriate QoS control leads to the creation of high-quality products and services, meeting customer expectations and achieving satisfaction.

As future work, we propose integrating the QoS model and algorithm described in (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2004) with the Poseidon framework. The idea is to create a QoS model and estimates for each task during the participative phase, specifically during the construction of a business case table. These estimates characterize the QoS that a task will exhibit at runtime. This information is then used in the analytical phase to compute the overall QoS of the business process. For e-commerce and other types of processes, knowing the QoS before making the service available to customers is crucial.

QoS can be characterized along multiple dimensions. Our framework uses a QoS model (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2004) with the following dimensions:

- **Time:** A common and universal measure of performance, focusing on rapid value delivery.
- **Cost:** Represents the cost associated with task execution, including equipment, human involvement, and supplies.
- **Reliability:** Described using a discrete-time modeling approach, relating the number of successful executions to the total number of executions (Nelson 1973).

Table 1 shows a partial business case table with QoS information.

| Task | Time | Cost | Reliability |
|------|------|------|-------------|
| Fill Form | 15 min | $10 | 97% |
| Check Confirmation | 8 h | $8 | 99% |
| Sign Information | 3 min | $3 | 100% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

##### 4.2.2 Process Mining

With the emergence of Web services, workflow management systems have become essential for supporting, managing, and enacting Web processes both between and within enterprises (Sheth, Aalst et al. 1999). These systems generate and collect substantial amounts of data describing the execution of business processes, which are stored in process logs.

Process logs, though vast, are often underutilized. However, the data generated from process execution is rich with hidden information that can inform intelligent business decisions. One key area of interest is process mining or workflow mining, which aims to discover implicit rules governing task executions (Aalst, Dongen et al. 2003).

Process mining can automatically determine causal relationships between sequential tasks. The Poseidon framework sometimes struggles to determine the correct sequence if there are no data dependencies. However, most processes have logical causal relationships. For example, in a simple process, showing the first page of a contract should logically precede showing the second page, even if there are no data dependencies.

By using process mining, the Poseidon framework can effectively find causal relationships between tasks that have been previously executed in other contexts. In our example, process mining techniques can reveal that the first page of a contract is always shown before the second page, establishing a causal relationship.

### 5. Conclusions

New economies and global markets, marked by intense competition, have necessitated new working models. Most companies recognize the need for business process management to increase efficiency and survive. Process design and management are critical in emerging architectures like e-Commerce. Organizations require well-specified and documented methods to guide the design of (Web) process applications.

Despite significant research in enhancing workflow systems, there is a lack of methodologies and frameworks for process application development. The development of adequate frameworks is essential to ensure processes are constructed according to initial specifications. Tools that support the automatic or semi-automatic design of applications would be beneficial for process analysts.

The core of the framework presented has been successfully used to design medium-sized processes at The Boeing Company. It is currently being used by M.Sc. students at the University of Madeira (Portugal) for business process design. We believe the framework is also suitable for designing large processes and represents a significant step towards better business process modeling.
