consists in configuring properly the connectors to interact with external applications.
Usually, workflow systems make available to the designer several types of
connectors. For example, to access databases, flat files, spreadsheets, Web sites, ERP
systems, etc. When specific connectors are need, but are not supplied by the workflow
systems, it is possible to developed them using dedicated development tools.
4 Framework Evaluation and Future Work
4.1 Framework Evaluation
Since we recognized that one-size-fits-all design methods cannot meet the needs of
diverse organizations, we present an evaluation of the Poseidon framework. The
evaluation answers and discusses the set of requirements presented in section 2.1.
Simplicity and ease of use. During the design of processes at Phantom Works – the
R&D unit of The Boeing Company, we have tried several methods to capture
knowledge from non-technical persons. The methods ranged for the textual
description of processes, activities, control-flow, and business variables to the formal
representation of processes using graph-based visual notations. The first method
revealed to be too descriptive and was not well understood by managers and staff
members of the organization. The second method was to complex for non-technical
persons. After trying to use several variations of these two methods, we reached the
conclusion that the use of a table interrelating business variables and activities (i.e.,
tasks) was a better approach. CEOs, managers, staff, and non-technical persons in
general demonstrated to understand and feel comfortable with the concept of business
case table due to its simplicity and ease of use.
Business process size. The framework was successfully applied to small and medium
size processes. We also feel that the framework is suitable to support the design of
large processes. Unfortunately, we did not have an opportunity to model processes of
this size.
Business process structure. The framework has been used at Phantom Works to
develop administrative processes. One interesting administrative process that has been
developed was the Travel Request Authorization (Cardoso and Bussler 1999). This
process can be seen as a reference model for travel requests. The process created
followed all the initial requirements. Furthermore, the framework automatically
optimized the process, since Poseidon found that a set of tasks that were carried out
sequentially in the original process could be executed in parallel.
24
Degree of automation. The framework has two main phases: the participative and the
analytical phase. The participative phase seeks to develop a process design within the
settings of workshops, where group studies composed of CEOs, managers, and staff
work together. The analytical phase seeks at using automated techniques to model and
derive the process design. In Poseidon, the results of participative phase are
automatically moved to the analytical phase. The analytical phase is fully automated
and its technical details are hidden from end users.
4.2 Future Work
4.2.1 Quality of Service
One important requirement of business processes is the management of Quality of
Service (QoS). Organizations operating in modern markets, such as e-commerce,
require QoS management. This management allows organizations to translate their
vision into their business processes more efficiently, since workflow can be designed
according to QoS metrics. An appropriate control of quality leads to the creation of
quality products and services; these, in turn, fulfill customer expectations and achieve
customer satisfaction.
As future work, the QoS model and algorithm described in (Cardoso, Miller et al.
2004) can be integrated with the Poseidon framework. The idea is to create a QoS
model and QoS estimates for each task/activity during the participative phase, i.e.
during the construction of a business case table. The estimates characterize the quality
of service that a task will exhibit at runtime. This information is then used in the
analytical phase to automatically compute the the QoS of the overall business process.
For e-commerce processes (and other type of processes) it is important to know the
QoS an application will exhibit before making the service available to its customers.
Quality of service can be characterized according to various dimensions. In our
framework, we have used a QoS model (Cardoso, Miller et al. 2004) composed of the
following dimensions: time, cost, and reliability.
• Time. Time is a common and universal measure of performance. The philosophy
behind a time-based strategy usually demands that businesses deliver the most
value as rapidly as possible.
• Cost. Task cost represents the cost associated with the execution of tasks. The cost
of executing a single task includes the cost of using equipment, the cost of human
involvement, and any supplies and commodities needed to complete the task.
• Reliability. To describe task reliability we follow a discrete-time modeling
approach. The stable reliability model used relates the number of times a task was
successfully executed and the number of times the task was executed (Nelson
1973).

4.2.2 Process Mining
With the mergence of Web services, workflow management systems become essential
to support, manage, and enact Web processes, both between enterprises and within the
enterprise (Sheth, Aalst et al. 1999). Workflow systems are capable of both generating
and collecting considerable amounts of data describing the execution of business
processes, such as Web processes. This data is stored in a process log, an independent
component that records the events for all of the processes being executed by the
enactment service.
Process logs are vast data archives that are seldom visited. Yet, the data generated
from the execution of processes are rich with hidden information that can be used for
making intelligent business decisions. Data analysis may uncover important process
patterns, contributing greatly to business strategies.
An important and useful knowledge to discover and extract from process logs is
the set of implicit rules that govern the executions of tasks during the execution of a
process. This type of mining is called process mining or workflow mining (Aalst,
Dongen et al. 2003).
Process mining can automatically determine the causal relationship between
sequential tasks. The Poseidon framework is unable, in some cases, to determine if a
task t should be executed before, or after, a task t . This happen if there are no data
a b
dependencies between the two tasks, i.e. from a data flow point of view, task t can be
a
executed after task t or the other way around. But in most processes there is a causal
b
relationship between sequential tasks. Let us consider the following very simple and
naïve example, at some point in time, a process executes the tasks t and
show_page_1
t . Both tasks show a textual page to the user. The first task shows the first
show_page_2
page of a contract and, naturally, the second task shows the second page of a contract.
From the data point of view, task t can be executed before t , but
show_page_2 show_page_1
from the logical point of view this sequence is not sound.
Therefore, when designing a process using the Poseidon framework, process
mining can be used effectively to find causal relationships between tasks that have
been previously executed in the context of other processes. In our simple example,
process mining techniques can found that, in the context of existing processes,
t has always been executed before t and, therefore, a causal
show_page_1 show_page_2
relationship exists.
5 Conclusions
New economies and global markets with their accompanying intense competition
have generated the need for organizations to adopt new working models. Most
26
companies have recognized the need for business process management to increase
efficiency and to survive intense competition. Process design and management are
key issues in emergent architectures, such as e-Commerce. Organizations need well-
specified and documented methods to guide the design of (Web) process applications.
Although major research has been carried out to enhance workflow systems, the
work on process and workflow application development lifecycles and methodologies
is practically inexistent. The development of adequate frameworks is of importance to
guarantee that processes are constructed according to initial specifications.
Furthermore, it would be advantageous for process analysts to have tools to support –
automatically or semi-automatically – the design of applications.
Unfortunately, it is recognized that despite the diffusion of workflow systems,
methodologies and frameworks to support the development of process applications
are still missing. In this paper, we describe a framework to assist process analysts
during their interviews with administrative staff, managers, and employees in general
to design processes. The framework includes a set of procedures that guide the
process analyst during his interviews and supply (automatic) methods to ease the
design process. As a result, processes can be developed and implemented more
rapidly and accurately.
The core of the framework presented has been employed successfully to design
medium size processes at The Boeing Company (Seattle, WA, USA). Currently, the
framework is being used by M.Sc. students at the University of Madeira (Portugal) to
design business processes. We believe that the framework is also appropriate to
design large processes and that it represents a good step towards the modeling of
business processes.
