While installing `pip` and Python, I encountered the following error message:

```
The directory '/Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi' or its parent directory is not owned by the current user, and the debug log has been disabled. Please check the permissions and owner of that directory. If executing pip with sudo, you may want the -H flag.
```

Since I now have to install using `sudo`, I am facing this issue. Previously, I had Python and several libraries installed on my Mac, which was running OS X Yosemite. After performing a clean wipe and reinstalling the operating system, I started encountering this prompt, and I'm having trouble resolving it.

Additionally, my command line prompt has changed from `Parthenon$` to `Philips-MBP:~ Parthenon$`. I am the sole owner of this computer, and this is the only account on it. This problem seems to be related to upgrading to Python 3.4, as things are not in their expected locations, and `virtualenv` is not being installed where I anticipate it to be.

**Possible Causes and Solutions:**

1. **File Permissions:**
   - The error message suggests that the directory `/Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi` or its parent directory is not owned by the current user. You can change the ownership of the directory by running:
     ```sh
     sudo chown -R $USER /Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi
     ```
   - Ensure that the directory exists. If it doesn't, create it and set the appropriate permissions:
     ```sh
     mkdir -p /Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi
     chmod -R 755 /Users/Parthenon/Library/Logs/pi
     ```

2. **Using `sudo` with the `-H` Flag:**
   - When using `sudo` to install packages, you can use the `-H` flag to ensure that the home directory is set correctly:
     ```sh
     sudo -H pip install <package_name>
     ```

3. **Checking Environment Variables:**
   - If you modified your `$PATH` variable, it could cause issues. Check your shell configuration files (e.g., `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`) to ensure that the `$PATH` is set correctly:
     ```sh
     cat ~/.bash_profile
     cat ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - Make sure that the paths to Python and `pip` are included in the `$PATH` variable. For example:
     ```sh
     export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
     ```

4. **Reinstalling Python and `pip`:**
   - If the above steps do not resolve the issue, consider reinstalling Python and `pip`:
     ```sh
     brew install python
     ```
   - After installation, ensure that `pip` is up to date:
     ```sh
     pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission and installation issues you are experiencing.
