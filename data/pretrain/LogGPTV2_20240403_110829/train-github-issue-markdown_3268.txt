 **TypeScript Version:**
1.8.2
When building a Visual Studio solution using a tsconfig.json file, the
CompileTypeScriptWithTSConfig task reports "Skipping target
"CompileTypeScriptWithTSConfig" because all output files are up-to-date with
respect to the input files.", even though I have indeed modified my .ts files
since the last build. I see this behavior both building from the command line
and from within the IDE. If I select "Rebuild Solution" from within the IDE,
the files get compiled correctly. Also, if I remove the tsconfig.json file
(thus using the properties in the .csproj file), the files also get compiled
correctly.
FWIW, I would actually prefer to use the .csproj file rather than a
tsconfig.json file, but as it stands now I cannot specify certain options
(such as --noImplicitReturns and --noFallthroughCasesInSwitch) in the .csproj
file.
