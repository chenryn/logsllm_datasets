User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释In general log templates, variables are represented as '<*>', and tokens are separated by spaces. Observe the following log templates:
<*>@<*>/<*>/<*>:<*>:<*>:<*>.<*> CSI Transaction @<*> initialized for deployment engine {<*>} with flags <*> and client id [<*>]"<*>/"
Which of the following logs is generated by the above log template? Assuming the first two tokens of the generated log are timestamp and log level.

A: 04:40:53 Info Reboot mark refs incremented to: 1
B: 00:01:03 Info 00000009@2016/9/28:16:01:03.072 PopulateComponentFamiliesKey - End
C: 04:40:53 Info 00000009@2016/9/27:20:40:53.744 CSI Transaction @0x47e9e0 initialized for deployment engine {d16d444c-56d8-11d5-882d-0080c847b195} with flags 00000002 and client id [10]"TI6.0_0:0/"
D: 00:00:46 Info SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload. [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]

Assistant: Answer: C

Explanation: Option C is generated by the aforementioned log template. This option matches the format and variables in the template, including the timestamp, log level, space separation between tokens, and the correspondence between the variables represented by "<*>" and their actual values. The other options do not match the template because their format does not meet the template requirements or they lack necessary variables. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
