different sessions. A similar behavior is observed in Figs. 4‚Äì7,
where Webex shows the least variance in streaming lag as
well.
Traffic-wise (Fig. 15), we focus on two aspects: (1) data rate
difference between low-motion and high-motion feeds, and
(2) data rate variation across multiple sessions with the same
feed. All three systems send out a low-motion video feed in
a lower rate than a high-motion counterpart as the former is
more compressible. The rate reduction in low-motion streams
is the highest in Webex, where its low-motion sessions almost
halve the required downstream bandwidth. With a given
video feed, Webex shows virtually no fluctuation in data rate
across multiple sessions. On the other hand, Meet reduces its
data rate in low-motion sessions roughly by 20% compared
to high-motion sessions, but with much more dynamic rate
fluctuation across different sessions than Zoom/Webex. Zoom
exhibits the least difference (5‚Äì10%) in data rate between
low-motion and high-motion sessions. Its downstream data
rate is slightly higher with peer-to-peer streaming (‚àº1 Mbps;
ùëÅ=2) than with cloud-based relay (‚àº0.7 Mbps; ùëÅ>2). When
QoE metrics and data rates are considered together, Zoom
appears to deliver the best QoE in the most bandwidth-
efficient fashion, at least in the US.
4.3.2 Non-US-based videoconferencing. We repeat the QoE
analysis experiment using a set of VMs created in Europe,
one VM in Switzerland designated as a meeting host, and up
to five other VMs (in France, Germany, Ireland, UK) joining
the session created by the host. Fig. 16 shows QoE values on
three systems with high-motion sessions. The results from

(with EBU R128 loudness normalization), and then synchro-
nize the beginning/ending of the audio in reference to the
originally injected audio. We use the audio-offset-finder
tool for this. Finally, we use the ViSQOL tool [19] with the orig-
inal/recorded audio data to compute the MOS-LQO (Mean
Opinion Score - Listening Quality Objective) score, which
ranges from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
Figs. 17 and 18 show how video/audio QoE metrics change
under various rate-limiting conditions. Each dot in the fig-
ures represents the average QoE values of five 5-minute long
sessions.
Video QoE. Overall, Zoom tends to maintain the best QoE
with decreasing bandwidth limits, although there is sudden
drop in QoE with a bandwidth cap of 250 Kbps. Meet main-
tains more graceful QoE degradation across all scenarios.
Webex suffers from the most significant QoE drops with
smaller bandwidth caps. With bandwidth ‚â§ 1 Mbps, video
frequently stalls and even completely disappears and reap-
pears on Webex.
Audio QoE. Compared to non-negligible QoE drops in video,
audio QoE levels remain virtually constant on Zoom and
Meet, probably due to the low data rate of audio (90 Kbps
for Zoom and 40 Kbps for Meet).5 However, voice quality on
Webex, even with its low rate (45 Kbps), is relatively sensi-
tive to bandwidth limits, starting to deteriorate noticeably
(e.g., manifested as distorted/paused sound) with a limit of
500 Kbps or less.
5 RESOURCE CONSUMPTION
After having investigated user-perceived QoE offered by three
major videoconferencing systems, we shift our attention to
their client-side resource consumption, such as CPU, band-
width and battery usages. For this analysis, we resort to

low-motion sessions are similar to those collected in the US,
and thus are omitted. When compared side-by-side, Meet
maintains a slight edge in QoE metrics among three systems,
potentially due to its European presence. In case of Zoom,
although its average QoE appears to be similar to that of
Meet, its QoE variation across different sessions is higher
than Meet for high ùëÅ. This observation is aligned with our
earlier finding in Fig. 6a, where we show that its regional
load balancing causes more variable streaming lag in Europe.
4.4 Streaming under Bandwidth Constraints
The experiments presented so far are conducted in an un-
limited bandwidth environment. The cloud VMs used have a
bidirectional bandwidth of multi-Gbps [3], which far exceeds
the measured data rates of 1‚Äì2 Mbps (Fig. 15). In the next
set of experiments, we apply artificial bandwidth caps on
our cloud VM and examine its effect on QoE. We use Linux
tc/ifb modules to enable traffic shaping on incoming traffic.
Here we present QoE metric analysis not just for video but
also for audio. We extract video and audio data separately
from recorded videoconferencing sessions. For audio QoE
analysis, we perform the following processing on extracted
audio. First, we normalize audio volume in the recorded audio

two Android devices: S10 (high-end) and J3 (low-end) as
described in Table 2. In addition to these devices, each ex-
periment includes one cloud VM designated as a meeting
host. Since the Android devices are located in a residential
access network of the east-coast of US, we run the meeting
host in a US-east VM. We set the videoconference duration
to five minutes, and repeat each experiment five times. The
meeting host streams the two previously introduced video
feeds: low-motion (LM) and high-motion (HM).
At the Android devices, we consider several device/UI
settings which can affect videoconferencing sessions. Unless
otherwise noted by the label ‚ÄúVideo‚Äù, each device‚Äôs camera
is turned off to minimize noise, and the incoming video feed
is displayed in full screen. Given the low-motion video, we: 1)
change the videoconferencing client‚Äôs view into a gallery-view
(LM-View), which assigns to each videoconference participant
an equal portion of the screen,6 2) turn on the cameras
and the gallery-view (LM-Video-View), and 3) turn off both
camera and screen (LM-Off), simulating a driving scenario.
CPU usage. Fig. 19a shows boxplots of CPU usage sampled
every three seconds for the experiment duration across all
devices and scenarios. Each boxplot accounts for CPU sam-
ples collected across five repetitions of an experiment. We
report CPU usage in absolute numbers, e.g., 200% implies
full utilization of two cores. If we focus on the LM and HM
scenarios for S10 (high-end), the figure shows that Zoom and
Webex have comparable CPU usage (median of 150‚Äì175%),
while Meet adds an extra 50%. When we focus on J3 (low-
end device), CPU usage among the three clients is instead
comparable (median around 200%). This indicates a dynamic
behavior of the Meet client which only grabs more resources
if available.
Zoom is the only client which benefits from the gallery
view (both when the device‚Äôs camera is on or off), reducing
its CPU usage by 50% on both devices. Meet sees no benefit
from this setting, which is expected given that it has no direct
support for it, i.e., the meeting host‚Äôs video still occupies
6Meet has no support for this feature. We approximate it by ‚Äúzooming
out‚Äù, i.e., revealing UI controls like mute or hang up.

about 80% of the screen. Surprisingly, Webex does not benefit
from its gallery view, even causing a slight CPU increase on
S10. Irrespective of the videoconferencing client, activating
the device‚Äôs camera (LM-Video-View) adds an extra 100%
and 50% of CPU usage on S10 and J3, respectively. The
higher CPU usage on S10 is due to a better camera with
twice as many megapixels (10M), HDR support, etc.
Finally, CPU usage is minimized when the device screen is
off. However, while Zoom and Meet‚Äôs CPU usage is reduced to
25‚Äì50% (S10), Webex still requires about 125%. This result,
coupled with the lack of benefit of Webex‚Äôs gallery setting,
indicates some room for Webex to improve their Android
client with more careful detection of user settings, as achieved
by its competitors.
Data rate. We now focus on the Layer-7 download data rate,
computed directly from pcap traces. Fig. 19b shows the
average download data rate per client, device, and setting,
with errorbars reporting the standard deviation. If we focus
on the high-end device (S10) and the LM/HM scenarios, the
figure shows a trend similar to Fig. 19a: Zoom uses the lowest
data rate while Meet the highest, and the HM video causes
a significant data rate increase, with the exception of Zoom.
When focusing on the low-end device (J3), we notice that
only Webex shows a ‚Äútruly‚Äù adaptive behavior, i.e., lower
data rate for both LM and the low-end device. Zoom instead
sticks to a somehow default data rate (750 Kbps), while Meet
only takes into account the quality of the video, and not the
target device. As previously observed for CPU usage, Meet‚Äôs
data rate is not impacted by the client-side gallery view,
while it drops Zoom‚Äôs data rate by 50%, both with a device‚Äôs
video on and off. Webex‚Äôs gallery view is instead less data
efficient, particularly when a device‚Äôs video is on. In this case,
J3 reports a significant increase in the data rate (more than
doubled compared to the LM scenario) due to the video sent
by S10. In comparison, S10 reports a much lower video rate
(700 Kbps vs. 1.2 Mbps) due to the J3‚Äôs lower quality camera,
as well as lack of light due to its location in the lab. Finally,
the LM-Off scenarios confirm that no video is streamed when
the screen is off, and just 100‚Äì200 Kbps are needed for audio.
