Certainly! Here's a more structured and professional version of the log data:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "10.30 17:02:17",
  "program": "putty.exe",
  "destination_ip": "183.62.156.108",
  "destination_port": 22,
  "proxy_server": "socks.cse.cuhk.edu.hk",
  "proxy_port": 5070,
  "proxy_type": "SOCKS5",
  "action": "open"
}
```

This format organizes the information into a clear and easily readable JSON structure, making it more accessible for further processing or analysis.
