This is a problem of implementation decisions. The adjusted mutual information
(AMI) between two labelings is an adjusted-for-chance version of the
normalized mutual information (NMI) of those labelings. There are numerous
choices for how to normalize; four listed in Vinh et al. (2010) are min, sum,
sqrt, and max. We use sqrt in `metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score` but max
in `metrics.adjusted_mutual_info_score`.
Consistency makes sense, especially when comparing these two measures to each
other. I think it makes sense to make the two definitions consistent with each
other. Alternatively, a parameter could be added to each, letting the user
choose their normalizing method. Since there hasn't been much study into when
to use which normalizing method (and the choice doesn't alter results much), I
think it's better to make a unilateral shift so both consistently use just one
normalizing method.
