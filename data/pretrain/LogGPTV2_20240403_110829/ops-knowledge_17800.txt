User: The new launched GoodleAppEngine(PHP Version) does not work on my computer.
Every time I type in "localhost:8080", the running server returns me a "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500".
And it give me a fatal ERROR:

Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required
  'google/appengine/runtime/ApiProxy.php'
  (include_path='/Users/xxxxx/Job_work/helloworld:/usr/local/bin/php/sdk')
  in
  /Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/devappserver2/php/setup.php

Does that mean my Python GAE disturbs my PHP version SDK?
Assistant: Thanks very much, hakre. I know what happened. The problem is I also have a python version Google-App-Engine.Thus, I need to specify the "development server" to GAE-PHP-SDK and it works well now!! Thanks again, I think I will deliver such a kindness to others in the future. â€“ moshaholo May 26 at 12:16
Can any one tell me how to change or specify the development server to GAE-PHP-SDK.  I just started using it and don't know too much about this stuff.
P.S Sorry for posting as answer. Wasn't able to see a reply option on top.
