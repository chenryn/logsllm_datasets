I recently launched the Google App Engine (GAE) PHP version, but it does not seem to work on my computer. Whenever I type "localhost:8080" into the browser, the running server returns a "GET / HTTP/1.1" 500 error. Additionally, I receive the following fatal error:

```
Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required 'google/appengine/runtime/ApiProxy.php' (include_path='/Users/xxxxx/Job_work/helloworld:/usr/local/bin/php/sdk') in /Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine/google/appengine/tools/devappserver2/php/setup.php
```

Could this issue be caused by the Python GAE that is also installed on my machine, interfering with the PHP version of the SDK?

**Update:**

Thank you very much, hakre. I have identified the problem. The issue was that I had both the Python and PHP versions of the Google App Engine installed. To resolve this, I needed to specify the development server to use the GAE-PHP-SDK, and now everything is working fine. I am grateful for your help, and I plan to pass on this kindness to others in the future.

Is there anyone who could guide me through the process of specifying the development server to use the GAE-PHP-SDK? I just started using it and am not very familiar with the setup. 

P.S. Apologies for posting this as an answer; I couldn't find a reply option.
