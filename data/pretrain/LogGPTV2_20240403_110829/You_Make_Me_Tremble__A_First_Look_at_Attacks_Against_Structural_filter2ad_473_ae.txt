### Figure 27: System Response to Actuator Attacks

- **(a)**: The ùêª‚ÇÇ norm of the system for each \( k \) attacked actuators.
- **(b)**: The maximum displacement at mid-span when the attacker has blocked \( k \) signals from the designed DoS attack. The horizontal line indicates the 2% safety level; any higher displacement is considered dangerous for the bridge.

### Case Study: Attacking a Bridge with Semi-Active Dampers

In our final case study, we investigate the impact of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks on a benchmark model from the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) community [2]. This model is used to study the structural performance of a bridge equipped with semi-active dampers under historical earthquake conditions. Previous research has utilized this benchmark to test the effectiveness of control algorithms in reducing vibrations and mitigating damage caused by seismic events [12, 45, 94].

#### Bridge Configuration

- **Dampers**: 20 Magneto-Rheological (MR) fluid dampers with a maximum capacity of 1MN.
- **Bearings**: Nonlinear isolation bearings.
- **Sensor Network**: Captures acceleration and displacement at the abutments and bent columns.
- **Control Algorithm**: 
  - **Primary Controller**: Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) algorithm that determines the command force.
  - **Secondary Controller**: Clipped-optimal controller that defines the input voltages to the MR dampers.

#### Safety Evaluation

Since bridges do not have different floors, we cannot use Inter-Story Drift (ISD) to measure the impact of attacks. Instead, we evaluate safety using the maximum displacement at mid-span [2]. Specifically, we study the maximum displacement at mid-span during the Kobe earthquake [74] to determine if the attack exceeds the maximum safe displacement of 2% of the bridge's height, where potential spalling, a non-reparable damage on the columns, starts to appear [93].

#### Attack Design and Results

We use the optimization process in Eq. (2) to design a DoS attack on the highway bridge based on the linear mathematical model from [2]. Figure 27 illustrates the ùêª‚ÇÇ norm of the system and the maximum displacement at mid-span for the DoS attack on the most damaging \( k \) actuators, ranging from \( k = 1 \) to \( k = 20 \).

- **Figure 28**:
  - **(a)**: Layout of the actuators on the bridge.
  - **(b)**: Actuators disabled for each designed attack, with \( k \) ranging from 1 to 20.

#### Key Findings

- **Critical Displacement**: Only 5 disabled actuators are required to surpass the maximum safe displacement for this bridge. This information is crucial because an attacker might not be able to target all actuators.
- **Actuator Importance**: The histogram in Figure 28 shows that the mid-span displacement is heavily dependent on the horizontal actuators, particularly actuators 17 and 19 located in the bent column of the bridge. This is intuitive, as the displacements in the horizontal direction are usually double the magnitude of the vertical direction in this bridge model.
- **Optimality of Attacks**: We demonstrate the optimality of our attacks by comparing them to random attacks that deactivate \( k = 6 \) actuators, as shown in Figure 29.

### Conclusions

A structural control system is designed to reduce vibrations and tolerate uncertainties caused by variations in the structure, dynamic loads, or disturbances in the measurements and actuation signals [7, 25, 83]. However, there are no studies that design and evaluate structural control systems under attack scenarios. In this paper, we show that simple disconnections of some actuators or the injection of signals at specific frequencies, magnitudes, and phases can cause critical damage to the structure. This initial exploration of attacks against structural control systems is a crucial step in defining criteria for the design and evaluation of such systems, considering both robustness and resilience to attacks.

#### Contributions

1. **Benchmarks for Security Evaluation**: We propose high-fidelity industry-approved simulations of buildings and bridges, along with standard earthquake models.
2. **Metrics for Impact Assessment**: We introduce metrics to measure the impact of attacks on buildings (ISD) and bridges (maximum displacement and acceleration at mid-span).
3. **Attack Design and Comparison**: We design two types of attacks (DoS and False Data Injection, FDI) and show their superior effects compared to heuristic attacks.
4. **Defense Strategies**: Based on our previous work on physics-based attack detection [9, 37, 72, 91], we design and test a new model-based attack detection tool that can identify both DoS and FDI attacks on actuators (or sensors). For detecting attacks from the controller itself, an additional model of the control system is needed.

This paper is the first of its kind in this direction, and we hope it will motivate further research in this safety-critical area. Future work includes studying mitigation strategies, such as redesigning the system when it is found vulnerable to our attacks, and proposing attack-resilient control algorithms.
