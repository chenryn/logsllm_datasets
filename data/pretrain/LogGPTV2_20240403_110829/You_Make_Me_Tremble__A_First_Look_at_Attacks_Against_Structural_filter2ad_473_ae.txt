8 CASE STUDY: ATTACKING A BRIDGE
WITH SEMI-ACTIVE DAMPERS
Our final case study investigates the effect of DoS attacks on a
benchmark model from the ASCE community [2] to study the struc-
tural performance of a bridge with semi-active dampers subjected
to historical earthquakes. Researchers have used this benchmark
problem to test the performance of control algorithms in reducing
vibrations and mitigate damage caused by seismic events [12, 45, 94].
The bridge is equipped with 20 MR fluid dampers with a maximum
capacity of 1MN, nonlinear isolation bearings, and a sensor net-
work capturing acceleration and displacement at the abutments and
bent columns. Fig. 4 shows a plan view of this smart bridge. The
control algorithm consists of an LQR algorithm as the primary con-
troller that determines the command force and a clipped-optimal
controller that defines the input voltages to the MR dampers.
Since bridges do not have different floors, we cannot use ISD
to measure the impact of attacks. Instead, we use the maximum
displacement at mid-span to evaluate safety [2]. In particular, we
study the maximum displacement at mid-span for DoS during the
Kobe earthquake [74]. We want to see if the attack exceeds the
maximum safe displacement of 2% of the height of the bridge where
potential spalling, a non-reparable damage on the columns of the
bridge, starts to appear [93]

attack on the highway bridge, based on the linear mathematical
model from [2]. Fig. 27 shows the ùêª2 norm of the system and the
maximum displacement at mid-span for the DoS attack on the most
damaging ùëò actuators, from ùëò = 1 to ùëò = 20.

(b)
Figure 28: (a) Layout of the actuators on the bridge. (b) Actua-
tors disabled for every designed attack with k ranging from
1 to 20.
Notice that only 5 disabled actuators are required to surpass the
maximum safe displacement for this bridge. This information is
important, because an attacker might not be able to attack every
actuator. Fig. 28 shows the histogram of the number of times each
actuator is disabled for the 20 DoS attacks. This shows that the
mid-span displacement is heavily dependant on the horizontal ac-
tuators, more specifically actuators 17 and 19 located in the bent
column of the bridge. This is another intuitive result, because the
displacements in the horizontal direction are usually double the
magnitude of the vertical direction on this particular bridge model
and the design of the attacks identified this characteristic through
the ùêª2 norm. Also, the actuators in the bent column are the most
crucial because they support the mid-span of the bridge.
We again show that our attacks are optimal, with a comparison
to other attacks that deactivate k=6 actuators at random, as shown
in Fig. 29.
9 CONCLUSIONS
A structural control system is designed to reduce vibrations and
tolerate uncertainties caused by variations in the structure, dynamic
loads, or disturbances in the measurements and actuation signals

[7, 25, 83]. However, to our knowledge, there are no studies that
design and evaluate structural control systems in scenarios where
the structure is subject to attacks. In this paper, we showed that
simple disconnections of some of the actuators, or the injection of
signals on the actuators at specific frequencies, magnitudes, and
phases, may cause critical damage to the structure. This first look
at attacks against structural control systems is a crucial step to
define criteria for the design and evaluation of structural control
systems that consider not only robustness in its common use, but
also resilience to attacks.
As part of our contributions to this new area of inquiry, we (1)
Propose a set of benchmarks to evaluate the security of structural
control systems. Not only did we find and argue for the use of high-
fidelity industry-approved simulations of buildings and bridges, but
we also propose a set of standard earthquake models to consider in
these studies. (2) Propose a set of metrics to measure the impact of
attacks on buildings (ISD) and on bridges (maximum displacement
and acceleration at mid-span). (3) Design two types of attacks (DoS
and FDI) and show how their effects are better than other heuristic
attacks (e.g., in the Quanser testbed, we showed how our proposed
attack is better than others). (4) We start the discussion on unique
defenses for these types of attacks. Based on our previous work
on physics-based attack detection [9, 37, 72, 91], in Appendix C
we design and test a new model-based attack detection tool that
can identify both DoS and FDI attacks on actuators (or sensors).
To detect attacks from the controller itself, we need an additional
model of the control system.
This paper is the first type of research in this direction, and we
hope it can motivate more work in this safety-critical system. Future
work includes studying mitigation strategies such as redesigning
the system when it is found vulnerable to our attacks and proposing
attack-resilient-control algorithms.
