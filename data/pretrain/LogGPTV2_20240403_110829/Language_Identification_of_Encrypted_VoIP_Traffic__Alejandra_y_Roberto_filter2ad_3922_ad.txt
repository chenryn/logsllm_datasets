### 5. Related Work

Some closely related work is that of Wang et al. [31] on tracking VoIP calls over low-latency anonymizing networks such as Tor [9]. Unlike our analysis, which is entirely passive, the attack in [31] requires that the attacker be able to actively inject delays into the stream of packets as they traverse the anonymized network. Other recent work has explored extracting sensitive information from several different kinds of encrypted network connections. For example, Sun et al. [27] examined World Wide Web traffic transmitted in HTTP over secure (SSL) connections and were able to identify a set of sensitive websites based on the number and sizes of objects in each encrypted HTTP response. Song et al. [26] used packet interarrival times to infer keystroke patterns and ultimately crack passwords typed over SSH. Zhang and Paxson [36] also used packet timing in SSH traffic to identify pairs of connections that form part of a chain of "stepping stone" hosts between the attacker and their eventual victim. In addition to these application-specific attacks, our own previous work demonstrates that packet size and timing are indicative of the application protocol used in SSL-encrypted TCP connections and in simple forms of encrypted tunnels [34].

Techniques for automatically identifying spoken languages were the subject of extensive research in the mid-1990s [18, 38]. While these works used a wide range of features extracted from the audio data and employed many different machine learning techniques, they all represent attempts to mimic the way humans differentiate between languages based on differences in the sounds produced. Because our classifier does not have direct access to the acoustic data, it is unrealistic to expect that it could outperform a modern language recognition system, where error rates in the single digits are not uncommon. Nevertheless, automatic language identification is not considered a solved problem, even with access to full acoustic data, and ongoing work in the speech community aims to improve recognition rates and explore new approaches (see, e.g., [32, 8, 1]).

### 6. Conclusions

In this paper, we show that despite efforts to secure conversations that traverse Voice over IP (VoIP), an adversary can still exploit packet lengths to discern considerable information about the underlying spoken language. Our techniques examine patterns in the output of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoders to infer characteristics of the encoded speech. Using these characteristics, we evaluate our techniques on a large corpus of traffic from different speakers and demonstrate that our techniques can classify the language of the target speaker with reasonable accuracy. Of the 21 languages we evaluated, we are able to correctly identify 14 with accuracy greater than 90%. When tasked with distinguishing between just two languages, our average accuracy over all language pairs is greater than 86%. These recognition rates are on par with early results from the language identification community and demonstrate that VBR coding leaks significant information. Moreover, we show that simple padding is insufficient to prevent the leakage of information about the spoken language. We believe that this information leakage from encrypted VoIP packets is a significant privacy concern. Fortunately, we are able to suggest simple remedies that would thwart our attacks.

### Notes

1. Note that our classifier is not a true instance of a χ² classifier, as the probability distributions over each n-gram are not independent. Essentially, we use the χ² function as a multi-dimensional distance metric.
2. Due to problems with the data, recordings from the French speakers are unavailable.

### A. Data Set Breakdown

The empirical analysis performed in this paper is based on one of the most widely used data sets in the language recognition community. The Oregon Graduate Institute CSLU 22 Language Corpus provides speech samples from 2,066 native speakers of 21 distinct languages. Indeed, the work of Zissman [38] that we analyze in Section 4 used an earlier version of this corpus. Table 3 provides some statistics about the data set.
