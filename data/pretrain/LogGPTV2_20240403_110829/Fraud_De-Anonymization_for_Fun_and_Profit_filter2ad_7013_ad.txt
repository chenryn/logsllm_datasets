### Fraud De-Anonymization and Validation

#### Introduction
Detego employs a fraud de-anonymization (FDA) algorithm, such as UODA or DDA, to identify both fraudulent and legitimate accounts. This document outlines the validation protocol and empirical evaluation of these algorithms.

#### Algorithm 3: Interaction Protocol with Human Fraud Workers
This protocol is designed to provide ground truth performance evaluation for fraud de-anonymization algorithms.

**Input:**
- \( P \): User study participant
- \( m, n, q \): Numbers of accounts

**Output:**
- \( A[] \): Accounts attributed to \( P \)

1. **Reveal Accounts**: \( P \) reveals \( m \) accounts they control.
2. **Data Collection**: Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to collect data on the apps reviewed by the \( m \) accounts and their reviewers.
3. **Identify New Accounts**: Use the FDA algorithm to identify \( n \) new candidate accounts.
4. **Generate Attention Check Accounts**: Create \( q \) attention check accounts.
5. **Generate Questionnaire**: Formulate a questionnaire that includes the \( n \) candidate accounts and \( q \) test accounts.
6. **Send Questionnaire**: Send the questionnaire to one of the \( m \) accounts (randomly chosen).
7. **Attention Check**: Verify if the answers pass the attention check.
8. **Add Confirmed Accounts**: If the answers pass the attention check, add the confirmed accounts to the list.
9. **Verify Ownership**: Confirm the ownership of the newly added accounts.

#### Detailed Steps
1. **Reveal Accounts**: The participant \( P \) reveals \( m \) accounts they control.
2. **Data Collection**: BFS is used to collect data on the apps reviewed by the \( m \) accounts and their reviewers.
3. **Identify New Accounts**: The FDA algorithm identifies \( n \) new candidate accounts.
4. **Generate Attention Check Accounts**: \( q \) attention check accounts are generated.
5. **Generate Questionnaire**: A questionnaire is created to ask the participant to confirm control over the \( n \) candidate accounts and \( q \) test accounts.
6. **Send Questionnaire**: The questionnaire is sent to one of the \( m \) accounts (randomly chosen).
7. **Attention Check**: Verify if the answers pass the attention check.
8. **Add Confirmed Accounts**: Add the confirmed accounts to the list.
9. **Verify Ownership**: Confirm the ownership of the newly added accounts.

#### Fraud De-Anonymization Oracles
We leverage the fact that fraud workers know the accounts they control to validate fraud de-anonymization solutions. This approach converts human fraud workers into FDA oracles.

#### User Study
- **Participants**: 16 fraud workers from various countries.
- **Parameters**: \( m = 10 \), \( n = 5 \), \( q = 5 \).
- **Data Collection**: Each participant revealed 10 accounts, and we collected up to 175 apps, 37,056 reviews, and 22,848 reviewers from a single worker.
- **Validation**: Participants were asked to confirm control over 5 UODA-detected accounts and 5 test accounts.
- **Results**: 15 out of 16 participants provided correct responses to all 5 test accounts. UODA achieved an overall precision of 91%.

#### Ethical Considerations
- **IRB-Approved Protocols**: Ethical interactions and data collection.
- **No Fraud Required**: Participants were not asked to post any fraud.
- **Data Handling**: E-mails and photos were discarded after validation to ensure privacy.

#### UODA Parameters
- **Features**: 
  - \( C_l^{\geq} = \{(s, s') \in S_l | cr(s, s') \geq b_1\} \)
  - \( U_l^{\geq} = \{s \in S_l | ul(s) \geq b_2\} \)
- **Sets**:
  - \( \Omega_{l1} = \{s \in S_l | s \in C_l^{\geq} \setminus U_l^{\geq}\} \)
  - \( \Omega_{l2} = \{s \in S_l | s \in U_l^{\geq} \setminus C_l^{\geq}\} \)
  - \( \Omega_{l3} = \{s \in S_l | s \in C_l^{\geq} \cap U_l^{\geq}\} \)
  - \( \Omega_{l4} = \{s \in S_l | s \in (C_l^{\geq} \cup U_l^{\geq})^C\} \)

#### Empirical Evaluation
- **Attributed Account Data**: 23 fraud workers revealed 942 attributed fraud accounts.
- **Performance Comparison**: UODA and DDA were compared using the ground truth dataset.
- **DeepCluster Parameter Tuning**: Best performing DeepWalk parameters were identified through grid search.

#### Results
- **UODA and DDA Performance**:
  - UODA: Precision = 85.11%, Recall = 82.59%, F1 = 83%
  - DDA: Precision = 92.05%, Recall = 90.32%, F1 = 91.11%

- **Co-Ownership Predictor**:
  - cowPred significantly outperformed ELSIEDET in terms of F1 score.

This structured approach ensures clarity, coherence, and professionalism in the presentation of the fraud de-anonymization and validation process.
