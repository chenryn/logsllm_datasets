Admiral Hopper says...
From an interview segment by Morley Safer in 1982
$=c (speed of light matters)
• distance light travels in a:
• millisecond ~300km (~186 miles)
• microsecond ~300m (~328 yards)
• nanosecond ~30cm (~1 foot)

ﬁnance at DEF CON?
• You know it!
• DEF CON is all about offensive and defensive 
techniques and technologies
• Sometimes, knowing that a vulnerability exists 
to be exploited helps to focus attention. 
• Sometimes, people like me tell you things that 
sound completely crazy but have a history of 
coming true.

trading history
•
1200s - Commodity and Debt trading
•
1500s - Inter-market trading
•
1600s - Equity trading
•
early 1800s - Reuters uses carrier pigeons
•
late 1800s - electronic ticker tape (market data feeds) become 
widespread
•
mid 1900s - quotation systems (next price rather than last 
price) become widespread
•
late 1900s - computers are used to maintain the records 
of the exchange
•
early 2000s - computers begin trading with each other 
without human intervention

deﬁnitions
• high speed trading: committing trades on a 
scale faster than human interactive speeds
• algorithmic trading: trades based on the 
mathematical result of incoming 
information from external sources (news, 
market data, etc.)
10
arbitrage
• the practice of taking advantage of a price difference 
between two or more markets: striking a combination of 
matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the 
proﬁt being the difference between the market prices.
• in space - between two geographically separated 
markets
• in time - between the moment information is available 
and the moment information is widely known
11
time
• when markets were new (middle of last 
millennium) trade times were measured at a 
very human scale
• late 1800s brought trade times to minutes
• 1900s brought trade times to seconds
• 2000s bring trade times in 100s of 
microseconds
• Future trade times may well involve
tachyon emissions

architecture
13
how fast is fast?
• seconds: you have no position
• milliseconds: you lose nearly every time
• sub-millisecond: big players regularly beat you
• 100s of microseconds: you’re a bit player and 
missing a lot
• 10s of microseconds: you’re usually winning
14
predictability
• Almost as important as sheer speed is 
predictable speed.
• Enemies are: jitter, packet loss, inefﬁcient 
protocols (tcp)
• Dropped packet is dropped cash
15
proximity
• Proximity relieves many of the speed/latency/
jitter effects 
• You’re on the LAN, not the MAN or the WAN
16
latency costs $
• latency has a $$cost associated with it - 
measurable and therefore fundable
17
missing?
18
oh crap.
19
dude, where’s my ﬁrewall?
• no ﬁrewalls... 
• they add latency (a lot of latency)
• latency costs $
• risk < cost < proﬁt
20
acl me please?
• no acls
• they add latency
• (most) switches can’t cut through switch 
while acls are on
• risk < cost < proﬁt
21
harden this...
• no (meaningful) system hardening
• reduced system loading (stripped bare)
• largely custom interfacing code 
(ethernet / inﬁniband / PCIe)
• and the usual complaints about 
maintainability and problem resolution
22
Specialized Systems
23
threat modelling
• we know what’s missing in our usual suite 
of controls
• how do we describe it?
• how do we determine what is a reasonable 
threat to build protective measures against?
24
THREAT: vendors
• You’re trusting that the marketing slick is 
what you’ll get.
• You’re trusting that they haven’t hired any 
bad guys.
25
MAYBE: vendors
• How about a vendor developer who alters 
the patches you receive so that the 
Precision Time Protocol (PTPv2 - 802.1AS) 
has a different concept of a microsecond 
from the one everyone else is using?
http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1as.html
26
THREAT: developers
• In most algo-trading, the developer isn’t a 
traditional developer with all of the usual 
SDLC controls
• The developer is probably a trader or a 
trader underling who has live access to the 
production algo engine and can make on-
the-ﬂy changes
27
YES: Developers
• Sergey Aleynikov

in prison (8 years 1 
month) and $12,500 ﬁne

28
THREAT: the insider
• not *that* kind of insider
• how do you deal with a trader (or 
administrator) who is utilizing access to 
market data networks or exchange 
networks to cause negative effects on 
other participants?
29
YES: Traders
• Samarth Agrawal

• several hundred pages 
of code from Societe 
Generale
• sentenced to 3 years 
in prison + 2 years 
supervised release + 
deportation
30
THREAT: the market
• This is an odd kind of technical threat
• Can the market itself cause issues with 
your systems?
• malformed messages
• transaction risk scrutiny
• compromised systems
31
YES: Market
• 2010-05-06 - DJIA drops 900 points in

Ed Felten’s Summary
1.
Some market participants sent a large number of quote requests to the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) computers.
2.
The NYSE normally puts outgoing price quotes into a queue before they are sent 
out. Because of the high rate of requests, this queue backed up, so that some 
quotes took a (relatively) long time to be sent out.
3.
A quote lists a price and a time. The NYSE determined the price at the time the 
quote was put into the queue, and timestamped each quote at the time it left the 
queue. When the queues backed up, these quotes would be "stale", in the sense 
that they had an old, no-longer-accurate price --- but their timestamps made them 
look like up-to-date quotes.
4.
These anomalous quotes confused other market participants, who falsely 
concluded that a stock's price on the NYSE differed from its price on other 
exchanges. This misinformation destabilized the market.
5.
The faster a stock's price changed, the more out-of-kilter the NYSE
quotes would be. So instability bred more instability, and the market
dropped precipitously.

questioning trust
• is it even possible to trust within this 
framework?
• how to ensure that you monitor the 
threats?
34
traditional security fails
• 100,000 times too slow
• unwilling to learn that this is a 
fundamentally different world
• still focused on checkbox compliance
35
answer the hard one - later
• how to secure custom everything?
• how to be fast enough
• how to make the case that security efforts 
reduce risk and preclude disaster
36
do something!
• I’m not talking about hard stuff like code 
review, custom application level ﬁrewalls, 
mysterious FPGA stuff...
• Party like it’s 1999 -- 
NETWORK SECURITY BASICS
• even a little bit of Layer 4 goodness would help
37
ITSecurity:TNG
• where’s the next next generation...
• juniper and cisco are a start...
• weird severely custom stuff is a start...
• why aren’t we aren’t keeping up?
38
Well, thanks. 
What now?
39
DO ANYTHING
• at this point - step up - do anything
• it sounds so terrible to say that but even 
developing an architectural understanding is 
better than nothing
• make friends and inﬂuence people
40
DO ANYTHING
• you’re on the record as saying that you’d 
choose performance over security...

disabling-security-functions-in-favor-of-network-speed.html (July 21, 2011)
41
product vendors...
• time to challenge your vendors
• you want more than checkboxes
• there are other markets besides 
credit card compliance
• there is money to spend on whatever 
exotic thing you want to develop
42
product vendors...
• Some product vendors are getting this.
• Most aren’t.
• Because we’re “not asking for it”!?!
43
risk / process / policy / grc
• work with your business folks
• they understand risk - probably better than you do
• they have a different tolerance for risk
• understand how to use their knowledge to help 
you make good decisions
• do not blindly follow dogmatic statements
44
risk / process / policy / grc
• You’re not going to be able to change their 
minds about the cost of latency. 
• You can work with them to change your 
understanding of how to do things.
• Just because you did it that way last year 
doesn’t mean that’s still the best option.
45
compliance
• IT compliance people, meet the ﬁnancial 
compliance people - you have things to talk 
about. 
46
compliance
• The SEC is taking an 
active interest
• July 26, 2011 
announcement of the 
Large Trader Reporting 
Rule (13h-1) 
http://sec.gov/news/press/
2011/2011-154.htm
• There is more to come 
- other regulators are 
watching.
47
in the trenches
ORIGINAL RESEARCH
48
in the trenches
• understand your business partners’ needs
• look for solutions
• build PoC rigs to test
49
in the trenches
• encourage vendors to get with it
• spend time looking at the truly weird stuff
• be prepared for the continued downward 
pressure on transaction times
