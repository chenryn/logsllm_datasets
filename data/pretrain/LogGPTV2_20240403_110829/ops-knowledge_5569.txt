User: How to deal with heavy traffic access and ensure high availability and load balancing of the system? Please provide a high availability and load balancing solution.
Assistant: High availability and load balancing solution: 1. Use a load balancer: Use a load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple servers, so as to balance the load of each server and avoid single point of failure. 2. Use CDN: Use CDN to reduce server load, speed up website access speed, and ensure website availability at the same time. 3. Horizontal expansion: increase the number of servers to withstand greater concurrent visits. Using containerization technology for automatic expansion can more flexibly deal with large-traffic access. 4. Database optimization: optimize the database, such as adding indexes, caching query results, and reducing the pressure of database queries. 5. Caching technology: Use caching to reduce database access and improve website performance. Common caching technologies include Redis, Memcached, etc. 6. Fault recovery processing: formulate backup, failover, and disaster recovery plans, and conduct regular drills to ensure high availability of the system.
