# Differential Privacy and δ-Neighborhood

## Introduction
In this document, we explore a relaxation of differential privacy by adopting an alternative definition of neighborhood, which redistributes the privacy assurances based on the underlying distance between entities. This approach can be particularly useful for spatial and dynamic datasets, where the noise level can be reduced by exploiting the δ-neighborhood.

## Key Concepts

### Differential Privacy
Differential privacy (DP) is a rigorous framework for quantifying and managing the privacy risks in data analysis. A mechanism \( M \) satisfies \(\epsilon\)-differential privacy if for any two neighboring datasets \( D \) and \( D' \) that differ by at most one record, and for any subset of outputs \( S \):

\[
\Pr[M(D) \in S] \leq e^\epsilon \cdot \Pr[M(D') \in S]
\]

### Relaxations of Differential Privacy
1. **(ε, δ)-Differential Privacy**: Relaxes the bound with an additive factor δ.
2. **Attribute and Bit Differential Privacy**: Two datasets are neighbors if they differ at only one attribute value or one bit.
3. **Pan-Privacy**: Ensures that each datum is discarded immediately after processing, guaranteeing that the internal state is differentially private.

### δ-Neighborhood
A dataset \( D \) is said to be in the δ-neighborhood of \( D' \) if the distance between them is at most δ. For example, if \( D = D' + \{x\} \) and \( x \) is near the source, then \( D \) and \( D' \) are in the δ-neighborhood.

## Theoretical Analysis

### Example: Laplace Mechanism
For the Laplace mechanism, the error function is quadratic, i.e., \( \text{Err}_i(\epsilon) = c_i \epsilon^{-2} \). If \( c_i = 1 \) for all \( i \), the problem becomes a convex optimization problem that can be solved using solvers like SDPT3.

### Online and Offline Allocation
- **Offline Allocation**: Solves the constrained optimization problem to find the optimal budget allocation.
- **Online Allocation**: At each time step \( i \), the algorithm draws \( N \) samples from the distribution of weights and computes the average error for each candidate budget. The candidate with the smallest average error is chosen.

### Performance Evaluation
- **Experiment Setup**: We evaluate the performance of the online algorithm compared to the offline optimal solution and a baseline initial solution \( e_I \).
- **Results**: Figures 7 and 8 show the comparison of errors for different settings of \( \delta \) and \( p \).

## Conclusion
