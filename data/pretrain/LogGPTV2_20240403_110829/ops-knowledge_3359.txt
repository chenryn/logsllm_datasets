In the left menu of the Settings page, choose Docker Engine. 5. Add the following at the end of the Docker Engine configuration file: ``` { "experimental": true } ``` 6. Save the changes and exit the setup. 7. Open a command line interface (such as CMD or PowerShell). 8. Run the following command to download the desired Docker image: ``` docker pull <image-name> ``` where <image-name> is the name of the Docker image to download. 9. After waiting for the image download to complete, run the following command to start the container: ``` docker run <image-name> ``` where <image-name> is the name of the container to start. 10. When the container is running, you can use the following command to execute the command inside the container: ``` docker exec <container-name> <command> ``` where <container-name> is the name of the running container, <command> is the command to be executed inside the container. These are the simple steps to get a Docker container up and running on a Windows system. Note that running Docker containers on Windows systems may involve different configurations and steps, depending on your system and needs.
