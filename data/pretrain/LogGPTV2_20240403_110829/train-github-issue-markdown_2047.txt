Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-create-a-set-of-
checkboxes has an issue.
To reproduce: try the challenge and when you are going to name the checkboxes
the challenge will be correct if you only type one name.
Expected: The challenge will only mark as complete if all three checkboxes
have the same name.
