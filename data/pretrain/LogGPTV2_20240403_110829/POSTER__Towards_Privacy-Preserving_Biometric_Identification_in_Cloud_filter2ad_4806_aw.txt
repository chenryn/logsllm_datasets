Curriculum Vitae
Christina-Angeliki Toli was born in Thessaloniki, Greece. She received the
B.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Specialization on
Electronics & Computers from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (ECE
AUTH), Greece. In November 2011, she obtained the M.Sc. degree in Computer
Engineering from the same university ECE AUTH, Greece. She was member
of the Information Processing and Computing Laboratory and the Multimedia
Understanding Group. Her Master’s thesis based on the topics of Computational
Intelligence (Data Integration, Management and Representation, Data Mining,
Machine Learning, Description logics, Semantic Web), was entitled “Design
and Implementation of an Ontology as a Tool for the Organization of the
Undergraduate Studies Program of the ECE AUTH”. Since then, she is member
of the Stanford University-Protégé Community Platform for the evaluation of
the Protégé tool for ontologies design. Since March 2012, she is member of the
National Association of Electrical and Computers Engineering Organization of
the Technical Chamber of Greece. In October 2012, she joined Computer Security
and Industrial Cryptography (COSIC) research group of the Department of
Electrical Engineering (ESAT) at KU Leuven, Belgium. She started her PhD
under the supervision of Professor Bart Preneel. Her research was ﬁnancially
supported by the European Project FIDELITY (Fast and trustworthy Identity
Delivery and Check with ePassports leveraging Traveler privacy) and a grant of
the KU Leuven Research Council (C16/15/058). Her main research interests are
biometrics, template protection schemes, secure access control and identity
management, privacy-preserving authentication, and privacy-by-design for
secure biometric applications.
