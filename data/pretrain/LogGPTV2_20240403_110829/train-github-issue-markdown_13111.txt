Could anyone help me with the following please?
I'm unable to light custom geometries, even just a single triangle.
I made the following "as-simple-as-possible" demo:
http://gnitsuk.leadhoster.com/ThreeTest/Test.html
The scene shows a cube and a triangle. Notice that only the cube is responding
to the PointLIght, the triangle is dark. It makes no difference if I change
the winding of the traingle in the call triangleGeometry.faces.push.
If you left click on the page the pointlight is alternately removed and added
to the scene. The source code is viewable from the browser.
Can anyone see what I've done wrongly that prevents the triangle from
responding to the lighting?
Thanks,
Mitch.
