5.2.  Analysis  of  trade-offs  between  different 
types of mitigations  
Through  the  second  set  of  experimental  runs  we 
looked at two options that an organization might use to 
reduce  the  exposure  window:  (1)  add  more  signature 
based or similar type of security measures that can be 
put  into  effect  earlier;  (2)  expedite  patch  deployment 
processes.  
5.2.1.  Signature  based  mitigations.  Figure  6  shows 
the  results  from  simulations  when  early,  pre-patching 
mitigations were increased to cover 22% and then 45% 
of  all  vulnerability  population  compared 
the 
previous results when these types of mitigations where 
at  3%.  We  can  see  that  a  much  large  proportion  of 
vulnerabilities are being mitigated earlier, but since the 
patching  timeline stays the  same, there is still a large 
proportion that is taking up to 360 days to mitigate. 
This  analyses  highlights  that,  depending  on  how 
effective signature based mitigation measures are, they 
to 
can  be  extremely  useful  at  reducing  the  exposure 
window  for  organizations  where  patch  deployment  is 
slow and constrained. A lot depends, however, on the 
effectiveness  of  these  extra  mechanisms  compared  to 
their  cost  of  deployment.  None  of 
the  current 
mechanisms  are  100%  effective,  and  so  organizations 
would  still  need  to  continue  with  their  patching 
processes.

the  difference  when  patch  deployment  was  done  1.5 
and  2  times  faster  across  standard,  accelerated,  and 
emergency  patching.  This  could  be  representative  not 
only  of  the  case  when  the  large  organization  deploys 
patches  faster,  but  also  of  an  organization  with  a 
smaller  number  of  systems  that  takes  less  time  to 
patch.  The  results  in  figure  7  shows  proportional 
increase  in  the  number  of  vulnerabilities  mitigated 
earlier, as the patching speed increases.

6. Discussion 
While  we  believe  the  results  from  the  simulations 
based on the model described here provide interesting 
insights into how long it takes to close the vulnerability 
exposure window and the different impact that various 
mitigation  measures  have, 
the  overall  modelling 
approach can equally well be applied to other areas of 
security,  to  examine  other  key  security  processes  or 
general  IT  operations  processes  as  they  affect  the 
organization's risk exposure. 
The  modelling  approach  described  in  this  paper  is 
especially  good 
for  exploring  possibilities  and 
answering what-if questions, which can be particularly 
helpful  in  security  decision-making,  which  currently 
lacks  a  rich  set  of  tools.  In  large  organizations,  the 
security operations team does not always get to control 
patching, but has to negotiate policy and deadlines with 
other  departments,  and  through  our  work  we  aim  to 
provide  them  with  the  tools  they  can  use  to  show,  in 
concrete terms, the improvements that will result from 
well-chosen  security  policies  and 
in 
security technologies.  
investments 
In the future we would like to take this work into at 
least two further directions.   
in 
Cost  trade-offs.  Cost  trade-offs  of  the  different 
mitigation measures, such as the cost of implementing 
signature-based measures compared to the faster patch 
deployment  have  not  been  covered  in  this  paper. 
However, we plan to extend the model so that it can be 
used  to  weigh  a  smaller  exposure  window  and 
decreased  emergency  patching  cost  against 
the 
operational  overhead  and  business  risk.    The  most 
important  part  when  calculating  trade-offs  is  the 
effectiveness of the security measures at mitigating the 
various 
this  paper 
contributes to that.  It would be interesting to complete 
the  picture  by  incorporating  cost  information  into  the 
model for all the different processes, so that as well as 
exploring  effectiveness  we  could  also  investigate 
expected  costs under various conditions.

threats,  and 
External  threat  environment.  The  second  direction 
for  future  work  is  in  improving  our  model  of  the 
external  threat  environment.    For  our  simulations  we 
used  parameters  that  apply  across  a  generic  set  of 
vulnerabilities.  These may not be representative of the 
software  portfolio  of  a  typical  large  commercial 
organization,  and  of  the  subset  of  potentially  critical 
vulnerabilities  in  particular,  in  terms  of  rates  and 
likelihoods  of  exploit  code,  malware  and  patch 
releases.    Causal  influences  should  also  be  taken  into 
account, e.g., when prototype exploit code is published 
for a vulnerability, the software vendor is encouraged 
to  hurry  up  the  patch  release;  also  when  a  vendor 
publishes  a  major  patch  release  this  may  be  followed 
by a flurry of new exploit development. 
robust 
that  are 
Furthermore, security investment is about protecting 
against  future  threats.    The  threat  environment  is 
continually  evolving,  and  it  is  important  to  have 
security  policies 
to  different 
environmental  conditions.    So  one  way  we  intend  to 
apply this technique is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
an organization's security policies and processes in the 
face  of  a  variety  of  possible  changes  to  the  threat 
environment,  by  varying  parameters  in  the  model  to 
correspond to those changes. 
7. Conclusion 
In this paper we have presented a novel approach to 
examining  the  effectiveness  of  security  operations 
processes  and  protection  mechanisms,  which  consists 
of  designing  a  model  of  these  processes  and  running 
stochastic  simulations, based  on external environment 
events. We focussed on examining the "risk exposure 
window"  as  a  measure  of  the  effectiveness  of  these 
processes,  which  we  defined  as  the  time  from  public 
vulnerability  disclosure 
to  when  an  organization 
believes  the  risk  is  mitigated.  In  designing  the  model 
we have examined the decision making process in the 
security operations teams of several large organizations 
together  with  the  different  mitigation  and  patching 
measures  that  might  be  selected.  We  also  identified 
external  threat  environment  events  that  influence  the 
type  of  mitigations  that  are  deployed  and  the  time 
when they are deployed. 
impact  of 
An  important  goal  of  this  work  is  to  enable  the 
decision makers in IT security to predict the outcome 
of  investment  decisions  or  changes  in  policy  in 
advance  of  putting  them  into  effect.  The  results  from 
experimental simulations presented in this paper show 
the 
increasing  effectiveness  of  early 
mitigations  and  of  speeding  up  patch  deployment  at 
reducing  the  risk  exposure  window.  This  trade-off 
analysis can be directly used by the security operations 
teams  in  deciding  whether  mitigations  such  as  host 
based  intrusion  detection  would  be  sufficient  in 
reducing the risk.
