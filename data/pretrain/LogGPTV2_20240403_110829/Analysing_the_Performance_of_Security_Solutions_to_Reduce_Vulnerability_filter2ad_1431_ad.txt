# Exposure and Mitigation Analysis

## 5.2. Analysis of Trade-offs Between Different Types of Mitigations

In the second set of experimental runs, we explored two options that organizations might use to reduce their exposure window: (1) implementing more signature-based or similar security measures that can be deployed early; and (2) expediting the patch deployment process.

### 5.2.1. Signature-Based Mitigations

Figure 6 illustrates the results from simulations where early, pre-patching mitigations were increased to cover 22% and then 45% of all vulnerabilities, compared to the previous results with only 3% coverage. The data show that a significantly larger proportion of vulnerabilities are mitigated earlier. However, since the patching timeline remains unchanged, a large proportion of vulnerabilities still take up to 360 days to mitigate.

This analysis highlights that, depending on the effectiveness of signature-based mitigation measures, they can be extremely useful in reducing the exposure window for organizations where patch deployment is slow and constrained. The effectiveness of these additional mechanisms compared to their deployment cost is a critical factor. None of the current mechanisms are 100% effective, so organizations must continue with their patching processes.

| 0.4  | 0.35                                                                    |
| 0.3  | 0.3                                                                     |
| 0.25 | 0.2                                                                     |
| 0.2  | 0.15                                                                    |
| 0.1  | 0.05                                                                    |
| 0    | 0                                                                       |

|-------------------|----|-----|-----|
| 30                |    |     |     |
| 60                |    |     |     |

| 330               |    |     |     |
| 360               |    |     |     |

### 5.2.2. Quicker Patch Deployment

Next, we examined the impact of faster patch deployment, specifically at 1.5 and 2 times the standard rate, across standard, accelerated, and emergency patching. This scenario could represent both a large organization deploying patches faster and a smaller organization with fewer systems to patch. Figure 7 shows a proportional increase in the number of vulnerabilities mitigated earlier as the patching speed increases.

**Figure 7. Increased Rate of Patch Deployment**

| Patch Deployment Rate | Standard | 1.5 x Standard | 2 x Standard |
|-----------------------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| 30                    |          |                |              |
| 60                    |          |                |              |
| 90                    |          |                |              |
| 120                   |          |                |              |
| 150                   |          |                |              |
| 180                   |          |                |              |
| 210                   |          |                |              |
| 240                   |          |                |              |
| 270                   |          |                |              |
| 300                   |          |                |              |
| 330                   |          |                |              |
| 360                   |          |                |              |

As seen in the results, increasing the patch deployment speed to twice the default eliminates the long tail of unpatched vulnerabilities, with most vulnerabilities patched within 3 to 4 months after disclosure. This observation can inform policy changes, such as reducing patch deployment deadlines or ensuring robust emergency processes are in place to respond quickly to major incidents.

## 6. Discussion

The results from our simulations provide valuable insights into the time it takes to close the vulnerability exposure window and the different impacts of various mitigation measures. The modeling approach described here can be applied to other areas of security to examine key security processes and IT operations processes affecting an organization's risk exposure.

Our modeling approach is particularly useful for exploring possibilities and answering "what-if" questions, which are crucial in security decision-making. In large organizations, the security operations team often has to negotiate policies and deadlines with other departments. Our work aims to provide them with tools to demonstrate, in concrete terms, the improvements resulting from well-chosen security policies and investments in security technologies.

## Future Work

We plan to extend this work in two directions:

1. **Cost Trade-offs**: We will incorporate the costs of different mitigation measures, such as the cost of implementing signature-based measures versus faster patch deployment. This will help weigh a smaller exposure window and decreased emergency patching costs against operational overhead and business risk.

2. **External Threat Environment**: We will improve our model of the external threat environment. Our current simulations use parameters for a generic set of vulnerabilities, which may not be representative of a typical large commercial organization's software portfolio. We will also account for causal influences, such as the publication of exploit code and the subsequent release of patches.

## 7. Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a novel approach to examining the effectiveness of security operations processes and protection mechanisms. Our method involves designing a model of these processes and running stochastic simulations based on external environment events. We focused on the "risk exposure window" as a measure of effectiveness, defined as the time from public vulnerability disclosure to when an organization believes the risk is mitigated.

An important goal of this work is to enable IT security decision-makers to predict the outcome of investment decisions or policy changes before implementing them. The results from our experimental simulations show the benefits of early mitigations and faster patch deployment in reducing the risk exposure window. This trade-off analysis can be directly used by security operations teams to decide whether mitigations such as host-based intrusion detection are sufficient to reduce risk.
