User:  You need to tune a web application, what tools and techniques should you use?
Assistant: 1. Performance analysis tools: Use tools such as GTMetrix, Google PageSpeed Insights, WebPagetest, YSlow, etc. to check which parts can be accelerated, as well as possible performance bottlenecks and impacts. 2. Compression and caching: Compress CSS, JavaScript and HTML files, and use browser cache to reduce repeated requests. 3. Code simplification: remove unnecessary code, such as spaces and comments. 4. Image optimization: Compress image size and reduce file size to reduce web page response speed. 5. Loading sequence optimization: ensure that stylesheets are loaded first, then scripts, and finally the required HTML content. 6. Database tuning: Improve database performance by optimizing queries and allocating server resources. 7. Multi-server distribution: When traffic increases, multiple servers can share the load and improve performance. 8. Programming optimization: Refactor the code, optimize the algorithm, and use caching or interception to reduce numerous network requests. 9. Junk Cleanup: Delete unnecessary files, junk and expired database entries, ensuring optimized and complete organization of folders and databases. 10. Monitoring and analysis: Use logs and other monitoring tools to understand which pages are the most used, which are the slowest, and which need optimization, and then adjust this.
