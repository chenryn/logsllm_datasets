Improvised Explosive Devices 
Improvised Explosive Devices 
“The majority of insurgent attacks come in the form 
of IEDs
targetting
Iraqi and Coalition convoys and 
patrols. Most IEDs
are made from leftover munitions 
and foreign explosive materials which are often 
hastily put together. Vehicle borne IEDs, VBIEDs, 
are devices that use a vehicle as the package or 
container of the device. These IEDs
come in all 
shapes and sizes, from small sedans to large cargo 
trucks. There have even been instances of what 
appeared to be generators, donkey-drawn cards, and 
ambulances used to attempt attacks on Coalition 
forces and the new Iraqi government.”1

TEDAC
The U.S. Government explosives community, 
including the FBI, the Department of Defense, and 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, 
collectively formed the Terrorist Explosive Device 
Analytical Center (“TEDAC”).  Located at the FBI 
Laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, the TEDAC acts 
as a single inter­agency focal point to coordinate and 
manage the unified effort of law enforcement, 
intelligence and military assets as it relates to terrorist 
IEDs, and to technically and forensically exploit
all 
IEDs
