### Why is the Navy in Iraq?
- **Threat from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)**
  - Most insurgent attacks are IEDs targeting Iraqi and Coalition convoys and patrols.
  - IEDs are often made from leftover munitions and foreign explosive materials.
  - Vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs) use vehicles as containers, ranging from small sedans to large cargo trucks.
  - Other examples include generators, donkey-drawn carts, and ambulances.
- **Army Request for Assistance**
  - The Army requested help from the Navy.
  - Indigenous Navy electronic warfare capability was utilized.
  - Joint Communications and Control System (JCCS-1) was employed.

---

### The Electronic Warfare Mission
- **Objective:**
  - Suppress the RCIED threat to Coalition Forces and reduce casualties through enhanced electronic warfare coordination and JCREW operations, training, and readiness.

---

### Iraqi Communications Infrastructure
- **Landlines:**
  - Heavily damaged during the Gulf War, Iraq War, and subsequent looting.
  - Approximately 833,000 lines in use (population ~26.7 million).
  - Spotty service for those with dedicated lines.
  - Estimated $1 billion cost to rebuild.
  - Passed over in favor of cell networks.
- **Cell Networks:**
  - Installation began in 2003-04.
  - Providers: Iraqna, Asia Cell, Atheer, Korek, SanaTel.
  - Subscribers: 1.4 million in 2004, 7.1+ million in 2006.
- **Internet:**
  - Pre-1999: ~10,000 users (mostly dialup), primarily Baâ€™athists, loyalists, and wealthy individuals.
  - 1999-2003: <25,000 users, ~75 Internet cafes, censored satellite connection.
  - 2003-Present: 120,000 users and growing, estimated 500% increase over five years.
  - ISPs: Uruklink and others, using Middle East/European VSAT.
  - .IQ domain: Originally owned by InfoCom, assigned to Iraq around 2005.
- **Satellite-Based Communications:**
  - Services: Intelsat, Intersputnik, Thuraya (UAE), Iridium.

### Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)
- **Composition:**
  - **Initiator:** Command-wire (CWIED), Victim-operated (VOIED), Vehicle-borne (VBIED), Radio-controlled (RCIED).
  - **Detonator:**
  - **Explosive Charge:**

---

### Attacking the IED Problem
- **Eliminate Source Materials:**
  - **Initiators:** Dual-use technologies, designed for non-military purposes, exploited for IEDs.
  - **Detonators:** Also dual-use, particularly in construction, exploited for IEDs.
  - **Explosive Charges:** Large caches from past wars, including artillery shells, mortar shells, and unexploded ordnance.
- **Eliminate the IED Network:**
  - Locate and eliminate financiers and support structures.
  - Budget for "offensive operations" increased from 13% in FY06 to 31% in FY07.
  - Combined Explosives Exploitation Cell (CEXC): Technical and operational analysis of IEDs.
  - Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC): Inter-agency focal point for IED analysis.
- **Eliminate Bomb Emplacers:**
  - Tips, community pressure, and financial incentives can help.
- **Prevent Detonation:**
  - Primary job: Suppress the RCIED threat through electronic warfare.
  - Jammers: Airborne, vehicle-mounted, dismounted, with varying models and capabilities.
- **Protect Against Explosion:**
  - Armor protection: Not just about adding more.
  - More armor means more weight, decreasing maneuverability and increasing maintenance needs.
  - Underbody vs. sides, V-shaped hulls.

---

### The Future
- **Detection of IEDs using unintentional radiated emissions.**
- **Explosive-resistant coatings** to add protection without significant weight.
- **Local Eyes sensor network.**
- **Hyperspectral sensors.**
- **Countermeasures for Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP).**
