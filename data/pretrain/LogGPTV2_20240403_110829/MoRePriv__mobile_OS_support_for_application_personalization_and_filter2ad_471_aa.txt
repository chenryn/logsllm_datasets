ABSTRACT
Privacy and personalization of mobile experiences are inherently in
conﬂict: better personalization demands knowing more about the
user, potentially violating user privacy. A promising approach to
mitigate this tension is to migrate personalization to the client, an
approach dubbed client-side personalization. This paper advocates
for operating system support for client-side personalization and
describes MOREPRIV, an operating system service implemented
in the Windows Phone OS. We argue that personalization support
should be as ubiquitous as location support, and should be provided
by a uniﬁed system within the OS, instead of by individual apps.
We aim to provide a solution that will stoke innovation around
mobile personalization. To enable easy application personalization,
MOREPRIV approximates users’ interests using personae such as
technophile or business executive. Using a number of case studies and
crowd-sourced user studies, we illustrate how more complex per-
sonalization tasks can be achieved using MOREPRIV.
For privacy protection, MOREPRIV distills sensitive user infor-
mation to a coarse-grained proﬁle, which limits the potential dam-
age from information leaks. We see MOREPRIV as a way to in-
crease end-user privacy by enabling client-side computing, thus
minimizing the need to share user data with the server. As such,
MOREPRIV shepherds the ecosystem towards a better privacy stance
by nudging developers away from today’s privacy-violating prac-
tices. Furthermore, MOREPRIV can be combined with privacy-
enhancing technologies and is complimentary to recent advances
in data leak detection.

INTRODUCTION
Mobile applications are becoming increasingly personalized, ﬂu-
idly adapting themselves to the needs and preferences of their users.
Today, personalization typically aggregates user data in the cloud
and uses it for large-scale data mining. This approach has signiﬁ-
cant advantages for data aggregators, allowing them to present tar-
geted services and ads. However, as the ongoing DoNotTrack de-

bate illustrates, not all users are comfortable with sharing informa-
tion with large companies such as Facebook or Apple to obtain per-
sonalized results. Recently, a series of papers has highlighted the
severity of data leak problems in mobile apps [16, 32, 20]. How-
ever, existing work in this domain usually only detects when apps
use personalized data (in which case the user’s only remedy is to
not install the app at all), or falsiﬁes the data that apps access [25].
In both cases, the user forgoes the beneﬁts of personalization.
To balance the goals of privacy and personalization, we imple-
mented mobile OS support for rich personalization in the form of
MOREPRIV1 Privacy-aware personalization is a rapidly expand-
ing research area, often taking the form of client-side personaliza-
tion. Encouragingly, a recent study has demonstrated users’ gen-
erally positive attitudes towards client-side personalization [29].
Much of the state-of-the-art client-side personalization work fo-
cuses on solving a speciﬁc problem, such as privacy-conscious ad
targeting [44, 22]. Similarly, we observe a trend towards platform-
provided ad support in efforts such as Window 8’s Ads in Apps2
and Blackberry’s integrated Advertising Service3. In contrast, the
focus of MOREPRIV is on creating a platform to unleash developer
creativity across a variety of personalization scenarios.
Client-side personalization: MOREPRIV encourages leaving user
data on the mobile device, mediated by the operating system and
under the control of the user. This approach has many beneﬁts:
the user retains control over data, and cloud providers do not have
to worry about properly securing data, respecting the wide array
of user privacy preferences, complying with local and international
laws, running and powering expensive storage clouds, dealing with
PR repercussions of data leaks and unauthorized tracking (such as
the Apple location data scandal), etc.
OS support: When user preference information is collected from
all apps and OS interactions, it is considerably more accurate com-
pared to what any given app, even the mobile browser, can ob-
tain individually. Furthermore, the user already implicitly trusts
the OS, so performing personalization there does not expand the
trusted computing base. In MOREPRIV, personalization function-
ality draws from a single uniﬁed, trustworthy, and protected source
provided by the OS and exposed to developers via a simple API.
Personae: To enable easy application personalization, MOREPRIV
approximates user’s interests using personae such as technophile or
business executive. Personae can be used for a basic level of person-
alization, which can be extended through the use of custom clas-
siﬁers. We demonstrate how always-on user interest mining can
effectively and accurately infer user interests in a mobile operating
system. MOREPRIV inference is based on parsing and classifying

multiple streams of (sensitive) information about the user within
the OS, such as their email, SMS, Facebook stream, and network
communications. For privacy protection, this sensitive information
is distilled to a coarse-grained proﬁle (as opposed to ﬁne-grained
location data, whose leaks have caused much chagrin among users
and privacy advocates), without being exposed to apps. The use of
personae within the user proﬁle limits the potential for user track-
ing: while persona information can be shared by apps to perform
server-based personalization, for instance, it is not sufﬁcient to link
an individual user across multiple discrete interactions.
1.1 Contributions
In this paper, we
• propose OS-wide personalization to achieve personalization
and privacy on mobile devices, illustrate key opportunities
for mobile operating system designers, and suggest ways in
which mobile applications can be personalized;
• describe our implementation of MOREPRIV on the Windows
Phone OS; and evaluate the use of personae, through use
cases and end-user experiments;
• demonstrate automatic personalization of legacy applications
through case studies and show how MOREPRIV APIs can be
used by new apps for personalization and skinning;
• show how to support custom classiﬁers, the integrity of which
can be veriﬁed using the machinery of zero-knowledge proofs
to provide assurances to 3rd parties when the user has incen-
tive to fake personalization measurements;
• establish that using zero-knowledge proofs in our context is
practical in terms of computational demands experimentally,
ﬁnding that a classiﬁer using 100 feature words requires only
11 seconds of prover time, less than a second of transfer time
on a 3G connection, and negligible battery usage;
• present crowd-sourced user studies showing how MOREPRIV
personalization can be effective in a widely-used app such as
Yelp.

2. BACKGROUND
The prevalence of smart phones and other mobile computing de-
vices has opened up new avenues for personalized applications. As
users carry these devices with them wherever they go, they are sub-
ject to a level of user interaction never before seen on a personal
computing platform. Furthermore, they are typically equipped with
cameras, microphones, GPS, and several forms of wireless net-
working, providing a constant stream of data from both the physical
world and the Internet. Common examples of personalization in-
clude Siri, Google Now, and personalized local search. All of these
currently move a considerable amount of user data into the cloud
for processing. We begin by discussing compelling representative
examples of mobile personalization and then proceed to generalize
the requirements for a successful personalization platform.
Personal Assistants: Google Now and Siri are familiar examples
of mobile personalization. Both attempt to perform high-level tasks
on behalf of the user, such as planning commutes, selecting movies,
and making wine recommendations. Over time, these systems learn
the user’s preferences and personalize recommendations accord-
ingly, although the mechanisms by which this happens is propri-
etary.
If the user invokes the services frequently, they become
privy to a sizable portion of the user’s day-to-day activities, giv-
ing a valuable window into the user’s life when targeting content
and advertisements. However, this data is processed in the cloud
and is potentially visible to third parties afﬁliates for analysis. As
such, both the information given directly by the user such as “set a
birthday reminder” and secondary information such as gender and
age may be obtained in bulk.
Shopping: Shopkick (shopkick.com) integrates location-awareness
with user preference data. When a Shopkick user enters a brick-
and-mortar store, the app consults the user’s preferences to offer
discounts and recommendations. Users can scan the barcodes of
interesting items and are rewarded with discounts within the store.
This personalization is interesting in that it allows traditional mer-
chants to to target content, advertisements, and discounts towards
users in much the same manner as online retailers do.
Summary: The apps above share the following set of personaliza-
tion steps [28]: 1. Acquire personalization signal from user interac-
tions with the app; 2. Address the cold start problem of not having
data to base personalization on [38]; often, this is resolved using a
secondary source. Many modern apps encourage the user to sign
up with their Facebook credentials so they can “scrape” their Face-
book data; 3. Reﬁne personalization signal as a result of subsequent
interactions.
3. OVERVIEW
The apps described in Section 2 are representative of the per-
sonalization needs of many apps: they beneﬁt from an understand-
ing of the user, but need not collect enough information about the
user to personally identify them. In this Section, we describe how
MOREPRIV provides this information through the key notion of
personae.
3.1 User Interest Proﬁle: Personae
Personae are custom representations of various walks of life, of-
fering easy-to-understand targets for personalization [40]. In addi-
tion to being easy to understand, the advantage of this technique is
the degree of pseudonymity that it provides [30]. In other words,
using a persona provides a way to declassify sensitive information;
persona data is all that is released about the user to the application,
as opposed to personally-identiﬁable information like their name or
unique identiﬁers such as device IMEI.
In our prototype implementation of MOREPRIV, we target eight
personae. Each persona is represented by a Bayesian classiﬁer Cp,
trained on a manually curated list of keywords characteristic to pro-
ﬁle p. For example, the business executive persona represents strong
interest in business, ﬁnance, and national news. Thus, the corre-
sponding classiﬁer is trained on text from sites as the Financial
Times. On the other hand, the technophile proﬁle represents a strong
interest in technology, so the corresponding classiﬁer is populated
with text from tech blogs.
Our prototype of MOREPRIV supports the following personae:
activist, bachelor, business executive, sports buff, retiree, homemaker,
technophile, tween. Note, however, that we do not advocate for this
speciﬁc list of personae. Our goal in choosing the set of personae
is neither completeness nor exclusivity: arguably, it is very difﬁcult
to be comprehensive; similarly, there may be intersections between
these personae. Instead we optimize for ease of understanding by
the user and the developer. We believe these proﬁles are a rea-
sonable proof of concept but note that our system is modular with
respect to the personae that are used, with updates amounting to
simply re-training a Bayesian classiﬁer on a new list of keywords.
In practice, no user is likely to have interests that match ex-
actly one persona. As such, each persona is assigned a persona
weight that indicates how closely that persona matches the user.
MOREPRIV keeps a vector of these weights, called the user’s pro-
ﬁle. Consider an example user who is very interested in technology
news and somewhat interested in ﬁnancial news. His or her proﬁle
would have a high persona weight for the technophile persona and
a moderate persona weight the executive persona. We believe that
many users understand the value of personae: we performed a brief
anonymous survey of 179 crowd-sourced survey-takers, 39–45%
of respondents are more willing to share persona data, whether in
general or for the purposes of personalization, compared to the fa-
miliar baseline of location data.
3.2 Design Choices
The architectural of MOREPRIV is divided into three parts: User
interactions are observed by personal preference miners, that can
be as diverse as location information miners that tell whether the
user is home or on a trip, or transit miners that discover the activity
of the user (walking, riding a train, in a car, etc.). Miners also pore
over the user’s email, SMS, and Facebook streams to establish the
user’s interests and preferences in news and entertainment. These
interactions are distilled to a user proﬁle by persona classiﬁers that
come pre-installed (we discuss details of extending the system via
custom classiﬁers in Section 5). Finally, the proﬁle is used by a va-
riety of personalizers for different forms of personalization. user’s
interests and preferences for news and entertainment.
A key strength of MOREPRIV is that users remain in control of
whether and to what extent to use it, in order to appeal to a wide
spectrum of users. Previous studies have shown that users’ atti-
tudes towards mobile privacy vary greatly: conservative users may
opt-out and turn off personalization or data collection entirely Sec-
tion 4.4. Furthermore, conservative users will likely not to install
