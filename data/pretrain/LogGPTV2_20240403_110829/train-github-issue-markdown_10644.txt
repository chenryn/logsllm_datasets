### Issue Type
- Bug Report

### Component Name
- Mount Module

### Ansible Version
- Tested on both versions:
  - `ansible-playbook 2.2.1.0`
    - Configuration file: `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
    - Configured module search path: Default (without overrides)
  - `ansible-playbook 2.3.1.0`
    - Configuration file: `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
    - Configured module search path: Default (without overrides)
    - Python version: `2.7.5 (default, Nov  6 2016, 00:28:07) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11)]`

### Configuration
- Default

### Operating System / Environment
- Manager OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)
- Target OS (Tested): Ubuntu 16.04, CentOS 6.8

### Summary
The mount module does not allow the creation of multiple mount points with the name "none." This limitation makes it impossible to use this module to manage swap file mount points. During the operation, the module overwrites any existing lines with the same name.

### Steps to Reproduce
```yaml
- name: Swapfile | Install | Add swap entry in fstab
  become: true
  mount:
    name: none
    src: "/swapfile"
    fstype: swap
    opts: sw
    dump: 0
    passno: 0
    state: present
```

### Expected Results
I expect the `/etc/fstab` file to contain two swap lines: one from the default Ubuntu installation and one from the command. The expected `/etc/fstab` should look like this:

```plaintext
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
#                
# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
UUID=b3130c85-0e01-4501-8243-5d8982451909 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
UUID=8f70f922-924e-4951-ba10-04d61297b8f7 none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
/swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0
```

### Actual Results
After executing the command, the default swap entry is missing, and the `/etc/fstab` file looks like this:

```plaintext
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
#                
# / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
UUID=b3130c85-0e01-4501-8243-5d8982451909 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
# swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
//swapfile none swap sw 0 0
/dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
```
