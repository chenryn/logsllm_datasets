##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
Mount module
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
Tested on both versions:
    ansible-playbook 2.2.1.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
and
    ansible-playbook 2.3.1.0
      config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
      python version = 2.7.5 (default, Nov  6 2016, 00:28:07) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11)]
##### CONFIGURATION
Default
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
Manager OS: CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core)  
TargetOS (Tested): Ubuntu 16.04, CentOS 6.8
##### SUMMARY
Mount module do not allow to create several mount points with name: "none", so
it is impossible to use this module to manage swap files mount point. During
this operation this module overwrites already existent line.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
    - name: Swapfile | Install | Add swap entry in fstab
      become: True
      mount:
        name: none
        src: "/swapfile"
        fstype: swap
        opts: sw
        dump: 0
        passno: 0
        state: present
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
I am expecting to get fstab file with two swap lines. One from default Ubuntu
installation, and one from this command. Should be looks like this:
    # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
    #
    # Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
    # device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
    # that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
    #
    #                
    # / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
    UUID=b3130c85-0e01-4501-8243-5d8982451909 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
    # swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
    UUID=8f70f922-924e-4951-ba10-04d61297b8f7 none            swap    sw              0       0
    /dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
    /swapfile   none    swap    sw    0   0
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
Actually default swap entry is missing after this execution, and fstab looks
like this:
    # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
    #
    # Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
    # device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
    # that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
    #
    #                
    # / was on /dev/sda1 during installation
    UUID=b3130c85-0e01-4501-8243-5d8982451909 /               ext4    errors=remount-ro 0       1
    # swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
    //swapfile none swap sw 0 0
    /dev/fd0        /media/floppy0  auto    rw,user,noauto,exec,utf8 0       0
