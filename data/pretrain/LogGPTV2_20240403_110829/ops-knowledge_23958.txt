User: How to generate, use and manage a local SSH key pair when using SSH to connect to a remote server?
Assistant: The steps to generate an SSH key pair are as follows: 1. Open the Terminal application (Terminal), enter the following command: `ssh-keygen -t rsa` 2. Enter a name for generating the key, or press Enter to use the default name. 3. Enter a password as a protection mechanism or press Enter to skip. At this point, two key files will be generated: the private key (id_rsa) and the public key (id_rsa.pub). The steps to log in to a remote server using an SSH key pair are as follows: 1. Log in to the remote server, and copy the contents of the public key file to the `authorized_keys` file of the server. The following command can be used: ``` cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remote_server "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys" ``` where `user` is The username you use to log in to the remote server, where `remote_server` is the IP address or hostname of the remote server. Alternatively, the public key content in id_rsa.pub can be manually added to the server's `authorized_keys` file. 2. Log in to the remote server using the private key. This can be done in a local terminal application by entering the following command: ``` ssh user@remote_server ``` At this point, the SSH client will use the local private key to authenticate with the remote server. The steps to manage local SSH key pairs are as follows: 1. View the existing local SSH key pairs. Enter the following command: ``` ls ~/.ssh/id_* ``` If there are multiple key pairs, there will be multiple lines of output. 2. Delete a local key pair. Enter the following command: ``` rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ``` where id_rsa and id_rsa.pub are the names of the key pair to be deleted. When deleting a key pair, make sure that the key pair is no longer used. If the key pair is still in use, it can prevent login to the remote server.
