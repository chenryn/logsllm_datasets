User: Hey guys I know this is an old issue but I am wondering if there any news about it:
I have a simple query where I want to do:
filter('created >=', somedatetime).order('-counter')
I tried: filter('created >=', somedatetime).order('-created').order('-counter') but because created is a datetime the results are pretty bad.
A user can go through a list with infinite scrolling and we can choose a time window of 7,30,90 days but it seems I cannot this very simple query.
I was thinking of break created to two attributes (dayofyear, year) so that I could use the IN operator but this could be hard as I have about 2M entries.
Any ideas?
Assistant: No, there's no way around this. This limitation exists due to how indexes are constructed. You'll simply have to do either the sorting or the filtering in memory, just as other databases would.
