User: I want to download a dataset from mainframe using Python ftplib.
I am able to login to mainframe and I get default working directory as "CY$$."
I want to change the working directory to "CY01."
I tried using ftp.cwd('CY01.') but it changes the directory to "CY$$.CY01." instead of just "CY01."
While using command prompt I use below command to successfully change working directory:
CD 'CY01.' 
(a '.' at end of directory name is IBM command to change default working directory and not append it to defualt directory) 
I also tried ftp.sendcmd("CD 'CY01.'") but it gives error "500 unknown command CD"
Can someone please help with changing the defualt working directory?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: ftplib ccommand ftp.cwd("'CY01'") works fine. Have been using it for over a year now.
