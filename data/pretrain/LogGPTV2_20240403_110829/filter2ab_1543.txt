**ATT&CK ID:** S0203  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Hydraq

Hydraq establishes a Registry subkey to register the service it creates. It can also uninstall itself by deleting this subkey. The backdoor functionality of Hydraq allows remote attackers to modify and delete subkeys, thereby maintaining control over the compromised system.[71][72]
