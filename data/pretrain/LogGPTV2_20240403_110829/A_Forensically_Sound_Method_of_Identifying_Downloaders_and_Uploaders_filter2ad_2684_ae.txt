invalid or not forensically sound.
8 AVOIDING DETECTION
In this section, we discuss Freenet changes that might be proposed
to prevent the detection of requesters. We detail why they may not
be sufficient. It is our opinion that Freenet is likely not repairable
without significant architectural changes.
Changing the Maximum HTL. To prevent a statistical attack on
the HTL, Freenet randomizes decrementing the initial HTL (§2).
We prove in Theorem 1 that this algorithm is effective. In this paper,
we have focused on HTLs of 18 and 17, however these values are
merely for clarity; our technique works for any HTL. Further, if
a user changes their maximum HTL to something larger than the
current default of 18, its neighbors will immediately reduce it to the
default and these large values will be noticeable by investigators.
Configuring a lower HTL is also ineffective because it is easy to
observe the maximum value: HTLs that exceed the maximum are
lowered before being forwarded.
Randomizing the HTL. To identify a node as a requester, we
rely on consistent HTL values per manifest being referenced (§4.4).
Freenet could choose to decrement HTLs on a per-packet basis by
some integer d ≥ 0, requiring the investigator to include requests
with a range of HTLs in each run, possibly increasing the FPR. To
minimize the FPR, this approach would force an investigator to use
a threshold that drives down the TPR as well. But the approach is
not a clear win. First, we expect the investigator could statistically
infer the requester, given the HTLs for each request associated with
a particular manifest. On average, higher HTLs would be expected
from the originator. It’s non-obvious what algorithm selects d in a
way that prevents this inference. Including multiple HTLs in runs
could increase the FPR if such an algorithm were implemented.
However, our basic approach would still apply and would remain
effective, especially for manifests that are less popular. Quantifying
whether the FPR increase is significant would require an update of
our analysis in Section 4 to include manifest popularity. We leave
this analysis for future work.
Replacing HTLs with Probabilistic Forwarding. Freenet could
be redesigned completely to remove HTLs from requests, like One-
Swarm [53], which also attempted anonymous file sharing. Like
Freenet, OneSwarm peers search for pieces of a desired file dis-
tributed among nodes. The requests are partially flooded: requests
are forwarded along each neighboring edge according to a set prob-
ability. A random delay obscures whether a node replied based on
their own stored content, or because they were acting as a relayer.
OneSwarm shut down after research showed that it was subject to
three distinct de-anonymization techniques [54, 55].
Using Darknet Mode. The Freenet developers encourage the use
of darknet mode, where most, if not all neighbors of a node are fully
trusted [56]. This approach may help avoid detection by strangers,
but it is hardly a realistic approach to maintaining a viable, fully
connected network. Regardless, our algorithm is not specific to
opennet, and could be employed by a neighboring darknet peer.
Removing FOAF Routing. If FOAF information were not ex-
changed, д would not be observable. A two-peer attack, where
each peer manufactures requests to be relayed by the subject, could
be used to estimate the fraction of T expected by each peer. From
there, a version of our method could be employed successfully.
Masking IP Addresses. A requester could hide their IP address
behind an anonymizing service, such as a VPN. This strategy would
cause our method to associate the download with a VPN address
instead of a home address. VPNs reduce the investigator’s task to a
single point. Further, VPNs do not always work as advertised [57],
and the amount of security provided is challenging for consumers
to evaluate.
9 RELATED WORK
While prior work has investigated vulnerabilities in Freenet, our
work is unique in several ways. In short, we present the only method
Session 5C: Forensics CCS '20, November 9–13, 2020, Virtual Event, USA1507based on traffic passively received at a single observer with a justi-
fied and proven approach.
Borisov [58] applied information theoretic metrics [59, 60] to
Freenet and found it to have relatively low anonymity. McCoy [40]
investigated de-anonymizing Freenet. In our notation, McCoy de-
ln(T)
clares a subject to be the actual requester if o
T > 3.3 during a
fixed duration of time without regard to HTL. This ad hoc approach
took advantage of a bug present at the time in an old version of the
request routing algorithm. The routing algorithm has been entirely
replaced to use locations and the FOAF system. Regardless, it could
not be used as a forensically sound approach.
Tian et al. [36–38, 49] discovered a Traceback Attack in Freenet
that exploits a unique identifier (UID) assigned to each request,
normally used to detect routing loops, as confirmation that the
peer must have been on the path from the original requester. The
approach requires actively probing all neighbors of the peer, and
leveraging a Routing Table Insertion (RTI) attack in which the
attacker traverses the network toward the requester. RTI is an ap-
proach due to Baumeister et al. [35, 51] that does not de-anonymize
peers. The RTI vulnerability can be addressed with randomized
routing [61]. Freenet developers addressed the Traceback attack
by having peers discard a UID after receiving the response to the
outstanding request. Discarding UIDs does not address our method.
Roos et al. [39] show how Freenet network probes, intended to
gather obfuscated node values, can be used to infer the actual value
with a Bayesian model after multiple observations. The attack is a
general approach, but they provide a specific example of using the
approach to infer the bandwidth of peers, which could be used to
detect opennet-darknet bridges. Roos et al. [43] offers statistics on
Freenet session length and churn.
OneSwarm [53] is an anonymous file sharing network with
similarities to Freenet. It provides anonymity by removing HTL
counts, obfuscating timing delays, and flooding probabilistically;
we have shown that OneSwarm’s approach is not secure [54, 55].
10 ETHICAL CONCERNS
This work raises a variety of ethical concerns. We consulted and
adhered to strict ethical standards along many dimensions.
Human Subjects Research. We followed the policies and guid-
ance of our IRB, who explicitly approved our research.
Legal Standards of Forensic Soundness. Daubert [34] is the pri-
mary standard followed by US Courts when evaluating the scientific
conclusions of an investigator. We have adopted this standard as
our definition of forensic soundness by: (i) publishing our method
earlier in a peer-reviewed IEEE workshop [14] and submitting this
extended version for peer review; (ii) basing our methods on a
testable hypothesis; (iii) stating a known error rate for our method;
(iv) following an existing set of standards for our method; (v) and
using methods generally accepted within the scientific community.
There are many further considerations that are relevant to criminal
prosecutions and often case specific. While we cannot list them all
here, as noted in Section 7, cases that were initiated based on our
method have been upheld by US Federal Courts despite motions to
the contrary and lengthy consideration.
Mitigating Harms. For many years, Freenet has been prominently
used as a forum for the sexual exploitation of children. Our pro-
viding support to law enforcement follows universal ethics that
children should be rescued from harm. It also is aligned with the
ACM Code of Ethics [62], which instructs members to “ensure all
harm is minimized” and have an “obligation to report any signs of
system risks that might result in harm.”
Responsible Disclosure. Our method has been disclosed pub-
licly [14] and Freenet developers are aware of it. To our knowledge,
they have taken no actions because of it. Since before our disclo-
sure, Freenet’s website has warned users that it provides limited
protection and is vulnerable [63] in language so broad that it covers
our work. The installed software also warns that “it may be quite
easy for others to discover your identity” and that it is connecting
to “strangers” and lists neighbors as “untrusted peers” [41].
Ethics of the Freenet Project. Freenet offers virtually no pro-
tection against the weakest of adversaries who would misuse our
method. As such, Freenet should not be used by vulnerable persons
requiring censorship resistance and anonymity for ethical purposes,
such as dissidents. At the same time, Freenet is used rampantly by
those who sexually exploit children. From either viewpoint, the
societal value of Freenet is negligible. The Freenet developers ask
on their own web pages, “What about child porn?” They answer,
“How people choose to use the tool is their sole responsibility. As a
communication medium, Freenet cannot be considered responsible
for what people use it for.” [63] We disagree. The developers have re-
sponsibilities, especially when, perennially, the use consists of vast,
unmitigated harms to society’s most vulnerable persons. A similar
analysis of harms, protections, and responsibility can be applied to
the Tor Project and Onion Services in particular; see [20, 22].
11 CONCLUSIONS
We designed and evaluated a method for forensic investigation of
CSAM-based privacy violations and re-victimization on Freenet.
We observed that about one-third of the traffic on Freenet consists
of CSAM-related requests. Our method is distinguished from past
work in Freenet in that it can identify both uploaders and download-
ers, by its formal basis, and by its minimal resource requirements: a
single, passive peer that uses only the traffic sent to it. Our evalua-
tion is motivated by forensic soundness and is extensive. It includes:
in situ measurement of both real CSAM downloads and our own
set of (non-CSAM) uploads; derivation of the FPR and Power of our
hypothesis test; simulations of single and concurrent downloaders;
and characterization of the network to inform parameter selection.
We observed an FPR of 0.002 ± 0.003 for identifying downloaders.
For identifying uploaders, we observed an FPR of 0.009 ± 0.018,
a precision of 0.9998 ± 0.01, and a TPR of 0.44 ± 0.01. We were
consulted during investigations using our method, and we were
participants in several US Federal Court cases, which brought a
modicum of justice to many child victims of Freenet users.

APPENDIX
A ANALYSIS OF HTLS OF 18 AND 17
Consider a topology with a path of adjacent peers such that ob-
server o is connected to subject S1, who is connected to S2, who is
connected to S3, and so on for j peers. In this topology, requests
received by o may have come directly from S1, or relayed by S1 for
S2, and so on: o ← S1 ← S2 ← ... ← Sj. The HTL of requests re-
ceived at o depends on who is the requester and whether the edges
between peers decrements requests with HTLs of 18. This sample
space is illustrated in Figure 11, where Pr(d) is the probability of
decrementing an 18, and Pr(Si) is the probability that a node at
level j is the original downloader or uploader.
THEOREM 1: The probability that hypothesis H1 is true is no
different when a run is composed of requests with HTLs of 18 or
17, regardless of the distance of the requester from the observer,
if the probability is 1/2 that an 18 is decremented; i.e.,
Pr(H1 is true |Y = 17) = Pr(H1 is true |Y = 18).
PROOF: Let Pr(d) = 1/2 represent the probability that a given
peer does not decrement HTLs of 18 on a particular edge. Note that
Pr(Y = 18|H1)= Pr(d) = 1/2, and similarly that Pr(Y = 17|H1) =1−
Pr(d) = 1/2. From Bayes’ rule we know that
Pr(Y = 18)
Pr(H1|Y = 18) = Pr(Y = 18|H1)Pr(H1)
=
Similarly, we have
Pr(H1|Y = 17) = Pr(Y = 17|H1)Pr(H1)
=
Pr(Y = 17)
Therefore, we need only show that Pr(Y = 18) = Pr(Y = 17).
Let Pr(Sj) represent the probability that peer Sj is the downloader.
Following the black arrows in Figure 11 we have for Pr(Y=18)
Pr(Y = 18) = Pr(S1)Pr(d) + Pr(S2)Pr(d)Pr(d) + . . . +
1/2Pr(H1)
Pr(Y = 18) .
