Figure 12(b) shows ROC curves under different training set
size. The best BAC to recognize different subjects is 76.14%,
which is signiﬁcantly poorer than our previous methods. We
suspect the reason is that ALOCC relies on a large number
of training data points to learn self-distribution from input
one-class data to enable the network robust.

Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection. Fingerprint au-
thentication is vulnerable to presentation attacks, which can
be carried out easily at a low expense [39]. To enhance
its security, various methods have been proposed, including
the hardware-based and the software-based. Hardware-based
methods acquire life signs to determine the liveness of the in-
put ﬁngerprint, such as blood pressure [42], odor [15], oxygen
saturation [59], heartbeat [10], and electrocardiograph [40].
These methods rely on dedicated hardware integrated with
ﬁngerprint authentication systems. Software-based methods
leverage image processing methods to extract discriminative
features from ﬁngerprint images and utilize machine learning
techniques to enhance the defense against ﬁngerprint spoofs.
Some methods concentrate on the ﬁne-grained characteris-

tics of captured ﬁngerprint images, such as skin perspiration
through the pores [54], skin deformation [12], and image
quality [33]. Other methods resort to powerful deep learning-
based approaches to learn features to distinguish between true
and synthetic ﬁngerprints [30, 56]. Existing hardware-based
and software-based methods only focus on ﬁngerprint live-
ness detection. They ignore the intended puppet attack, where
the adversary may approach the victim and apply the victim’s
ﬁnger to the ﬁngerprint sensor when the victim is unwill-
ing, e.g., sleeping and fainting. The signiﬁcantly overlooked
problem motivates us to enhance the widely used ﬁngerprint
authentication method.
Behavioral Biometrics Authentication. Behavioral biomet-
rics authentication authenticates users based on inherent and
unique user’s behavior patterns, such as keystroke dynam-
ics [25,34,45,65], signature [64], gesture [28,65,68], and gait
patterns [49], where behaviors are captured through sensors
on mobile devices. However, they are vulnerable to behavior
variability in real applications. To handle this issue, behav-
ioral biometric was also designed to fuse with physiological
features to provide robust multi-touch authentication [69].
Besides, behavioral characteristics also served as comple-
mented authentication factor to enable traditional knowledge-
based authentication schemes (i.e. password/PINs, and pat-
tern locks) resilient against security threats in a highly usable
way [21,41,48]. Existing behavioral biometrics was designed
to authenticate users when performing speciﬁc behaviors,
such as typing or touching on a screen, writing a signature, or
taking a walk. However, it is extremely unnatural to perform
such behaviors during ﬁngerprint authentication to enhance
its security. Moreover, these methods are necessary to collect
behavior data for a relatively long time (e.g., more than 1
second) [65], which will severely undermine the usability if
combining these methods with ﬁngerprint authentication. Our
proposed system overcomes such challenges. We compare the
differences in research question, authentication delay, feature
extraction and classiﬁcation methodologies of these systems
in Appendix A.
9 Discussion
9.1 Alternatives to CNN
We chose to use CNN in FINAUTH, because Bai et al. showed
that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canon-
ical recurrent networks across a diverse range of sequence
modeling tasks and datasets [14]. Nevertheless, it is worth-
while to evaluate the performance of recurrent neural network
(RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks in
future work.
9.2 Limitations
Although we took great efforts to maintain our studies’ valid-
ity, there are some limitations in our studies and experiments.
For example, behavior variability and different postures may
incur additional false rejection, and undermine the usability
and robustness of our method. Also, FINAUTH requires the
user to hand-hold the device. If the device is placed on a
desktop stationarily, FINAUTH will fail to work. To solve this
issue, FINAUTH can be improved by reminding users to pick
the device during authentication if the device is detected not
being handheld. It is feasible to detect whether the device
is on-hand or on-table using the built-in accelerometer [29].
Also, FINAUTH may falsely reject a legitimate user if she/he
uses one hand to register while the other hand to perform
authentication. FINAUTH can also be enhanced by reminding
users to get the device in the right hand if the device is not.
The datasets we collected were from limited subjects,
in which demographic characteristics, e.g., genders, regions,
ages, were not perfectly balanced. Fingertip-touch behaviors
may differ between males and females, which we did not con-
sider. Older users, who have worked with their hands a lot and
even have ﬁngerprints worn away, may also have different
ﬁngertip behaviors from the general public. In data collec-
tion, even though each subject was told to hold the device in
different angles and directions to help collect more distinct
data points, they were not required to place the phone down
between attempts for their convenience. To enable FINAUTH
to work in real applications, it should further be tested to ﬁnd
out other underlying inﬂuential factors, which might under-
mine the performance. As for these older users with their
ﬁngerprints worn away, the behavior-based methods might be
effective for them. Another concern is user privacy security.
Since the sensor data in FINAUTH is related to user behav-
ior, preventing the sensor data from illegal access is of great
signiﬁcance.
9.3 Advanced Attacks
Besides the aforementioned three types of presentation at-
tacks, there also exist the following advanced attacks:
1) Sensor data injecting attack. In FINAUTH, raw sensor
data are acquired by calling operating system APIs, then pro-
cessed and input into an authentication model. Due to the
imperfection of machine learning models, the adversary can
generate adversarial examples to fool and bypass the authen-
tication model by querying models repeatedly [22]. Next, the
attacker can inject adversarial data to the sensor dataﬂow by
hijacking OS APIs. In this paper, we did not consider this
type of attack.
2) Adversarial input. The following adversarial machine
learning attacks are possible: i) model reverse attack [32]: the
attacker aims to infer the training data points used to build
the authentication model by querying the model interactively;
USENIX Association
29th USENIX Security Symposium    2231
ii) membership inference attack [66]: the attacker aims to
infer whether the constructed data points belong to train set;
iii) model stealing attack [74]: the attacker aims to use as
few queries as possible to compute an approximation model
that closely matches the target authentication model; iv) gen-
erating adversarial examples [22, 53]: the attacker aims to
generate adversarial examples to fool and bypass the authen-
tication model by querying the target model interactively.
3) Robotic attack. Robotic attack is also a threat of behav-
ioral biometrics [51]. For instance, the attacker can program
the robotic arms, such as a Lego robot, to imitate legitimate
user’s ﬁngertip-touch characteristics [61, 62]. In this attack
scenario, even though the attacker has none knowledge of
authorized user’s ﬁngertip-touch characteristics, he/she could
conduct lots of trials. Eventually, it is possible for attackers
to ﬁnd out the correct behavior patterns and drive the robotic
arms to perform this speciﬁc behavior. Defending against this
type of attack is also beyond the scope of our work.
9.4 Future Work
To make FINAUTH more reliable and secure, there are sev-
eral improvements to pursue in the future: i) enhancing the
CNN-based feature extractor. In our experiments, the CNN-
based feature extractor is pre-trained with limited data points.
Collecting data from more users will signiﬁcantly generalize
the feature extractor; ii) mitigating the impact of postures.
Building the posture detection model using accelerometer
data seems a promising method to tackle this problem [80];
iii) eliminating the impact of behavioral variability. This prob-
lem can be tackled by retraining user authentication models
using newly collected data to update users’ proﬁles with time
elapsing. Similar approaches have been used in FaceID [3];
iv) investigating reliability using more data points. To make
FINAUTH more reliable in real-world scenarios, we can con-
tinue the evaluation with a more diverse population in the
long-term and improve its performance.
10 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented FINAUTH, which complements
ﬁngerprint sensors to defend against presentation attacks, es-
pecially the puppet attack. FINAUTH models the ﬁngertip-
touch characteristics when users apply their ﬁngers to ﬁn-
gerprint sensors. It relies upon common built-in sensors to
capture instant behavioral characteristics to authenticate dif-
ferent users. We designed effective methods to characterize
the ﬁngertip-touch behaviors and demonstrated that ﬁngertip-
touch behavior is distinguishable from person to person dur-
ing ﬁngerprint authentication. To evaluate the performance
of FINAUTH, we compiled datasets from 90 subjects. The
evaluation results demonstrate that FINAUTH is robust and
can verify legitimate user with high BAC under minimum
computation efforts while successfully denying the access
requests from unauthorized users with a low false acceptance
rate.
