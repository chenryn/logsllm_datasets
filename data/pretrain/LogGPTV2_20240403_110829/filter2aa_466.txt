Copyright Infringement
• protects software
• owner has exclusive rights in the work, even
when copies of the item are given away or
sold
• the right to reproduce the work; the right to
prepare derivative works; the right to
distribute copies of the work; the right to
perform the work publicly; and the right to
display the work publicly.
Program Mods
• Owner of a copy of a computer program
is allowed to reproduce or adapt the
program if reproduction or adaptation is
necessary for the program to be used in
conjunction with a machine. (17 U.S.C.
117)
Reverse Engineering
• Protected by Fair Use
– The purpose and character of the use, including
whether such use is of commercial nature or is for
nonprofit educational purposes;
– The nature of the copyrighted work;
– Amount and substantiality of the portion used in
relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and,
– The effect of the use upon the potential market for
or value of the copyrighted work.
Reverse Engineering
• If reverse engineering is required to gain
access to function and ideas, any
intermediate copies made as part of reverse
engineering are fair use.
• RE will not protect you from a copyright
infringement claim if you are not legitimately
in possession of the software, or if you use
copyrighted code in your final product.
Lynn: classic fair use
•
Make sure program is legitimately obtained, make
intermediary copies as needed to understand
the program, but do not infringe the program
in your final product.
• Copies are necessary for figuring out how a
program works and for accessing ideas, facts,
and functional concepts contained in the
software.
• Do not use copyrighted code in the final
product.
• Do not steal the copy of the software that you
are reverse engineering
Vulnerability discovery and
reverse engineering
• Reverse engineering is generally legal
• Limits are copyright law, contract law, DMCA
• RE is usually fair use under copyright law
• RE can be limited by licenses and EULAs
• RE can be limited by non-disclosure
agreements and trade secret law
DMCA anti-circumvention
provisions
• Prohibits cracking TPM (DRM) that controls access to
a copyrighted work, or trafﬁcking in a tool that cracks
• Broad prohibition
• Successfully used to threaten researchers in the past
• Never upheld by a court
• Some exceptions in the statute for reverse
engineering, encryption and security research
• Exceptions are narrow
Misappropriation of Trade
Secrets
•
A trade secret is information that:
(1) Derives independent economic value, actual
or potential, from not being generally known
to the public or to other persons who can
obtain economic value from its disclosure or
use; and
(2) Is the subject of efforts that are reasonable
under the circumstances to maintain its
secrecy.
Misappropriation
•
Acquisition by improper means, or
disclosure without consent by a person who
used improper means to acquire the
knowledge.
•
Improper means includes theft, bribery,
misrepresentation, breach or inducement of
a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or
espionage.
•
Reverse engineering or independent
derivation alone shall not be considered
improper means.
Can a EULA or NDA...
• Prevent the researcher from raising a fair use
defense to a claim of copyright infringement?
• Prevent the researcher from claiming fair and
legitimate discovery defense in response to a
trade secret misappropriation claim?
• Subject the researcher to a breach of contract
claim if he reverse engineers in contravention
to the terms of that document?
EULA Enforceability
• Bowers v. Baystate
• Blizzard v. BnetD
• Combs v. PayPal
Patent Infringement
• one must make, use, sell or offer for
sale an invention described by the
patent's claims without the patent
owner's authorization.
• If a reader operates identically to the
card readers described in HID's patents,
then the company's legal threat actually
makes some theoretical sense.
Patent Infringement Damages
• Only actual, not statutory damages
IntellectualWeapons
• Website no longer exists
• Raises interesting questions about
interference between computer security
and IP rights.
Vulnerability reporting &
Speech
• Free speech protections and code
– First Amendment
– Functional Code/Actions Vs. Speech
• The law of criminal speech and crime-
facilitating speech
– US v. McDanel case
– Conspiracy law
– Aiding and abetting
