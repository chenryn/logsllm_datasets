### Processing IBM MQ Dumps on z/OS

#### 1. Specifying Operands for the Dump Command
To specify operands for the dump command, use the following format:

```plaintext
03 IEE094D SPECIFY OPERAND(S) FOR DUMP COMMAND
IEE600I REPLY TO 02 IS;SDATA=(CSA,RGN,PSA,SQA,LSQA,TRT,SUM),CONT
R 03,DSPNAME=('CSQ1CHIN'.CSQXTRDS),END
IEE600I REPLY TO 03 IS;DSPNAME=('CSQ1CHIN'.CSQXTRDS),END
```

The SVC dump will capture the specified data. For example:

```plaintext
IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED: 869
DUMPID=001 REQUESTED BY JOB (*MASTER*)
DUMP TITLE=MQ MSTR & CHIN DUMP
Figure 47. Dumping the IBM MQ queue manager and channel initiator address spaces
DUMP COMM=('MQ APPLICATION STRUCTURE 1 DUMP')
```

#### 2. Capturing Application Structures
To capture a specific application structure, use the following command:

```plaintext
01 IEE094D SPECIFY OPERAND(S) FOR DUMP COMMAND
R 01,STRLIST=(STRNAME=QSG1APPLICATION1,(LISTNUM=ALL,ADJUNCT=CAPTURE,ENTRYDATA=UNSER))
IEE600I REPLY TO 01 IS;STRLIST=(STRNAME=QSG1APPLICATION1,(LISTNUM=
IEA794I SVC DUMP HAS CAPTURED: 677
DUMPID=057 REQUESTED BY JOB (*MASTER*)
DUMP TITLE='MQ APPLICATION STRUCTURE 1 DUMP'
Figure 48. Dumping a coupling facility structure
```

#### 3. Using IPCS Panels to Process Dumps
IBM MQ for z/OS provides a set of panels to help you process dumps. Follow these steps:

1. **Access the IPCS Analysis Panel:**
   - From the IPCS PRIMARY OPTION MENU, select `ANALYSIS - Analyze dump contents (option 2)`.
   - The IPCS MVS ANALYSIS OF DUMP CONTENTS panel will be displayed.

2. **Select MVS Component Data:**
   - Select `COMPONENT - MVS component data (option 6)`.
   - The IPCS MVS DUMP COMPONENT DATA ANALYSIS panel will be displayed. The appearance of the panel depends on the products installed at your installation.

3. **Use the IBM MQ Dump Formatter:**
   - Select `CSQMAIN IBM MQ dump formatter panel interface` by typing `s` next to the line and pressing Enter.
   - If this option is not available, ensure that the member `CSQ7IPCS` is present. Refer to the configuration documentation for more information.
   - If you have already used the dump for preliminary analysis and want to reexamine it, select `CSQWDMP IBM MQ dump formatter` to display the formatted contents again using the default options.

4. **Navigate the DUMP ANALYSIS Menu:**
   - The IBM MQ for z/OS - DUMP ANALYSIS menu will be displayed. Use this menu to specify the action you want to perform on the system dump.

#### 4. Managing the Dump Inventory
Before selecting a particular dump for analysis, ensure that the required dump is present in the dump inventory:

1. **Display All Dump Titles:**
   - If you do not know the name of the data set containing the dump, specify option 1 - `Display all dump titles xx through xx`.
   - This displays the dump titles of all the dumps contained in the `SYS1.DUMP` data sets. You can limit the selection of data sets for display by specifying a range of data set numbers.

2. **Manage the Dump Inventory:**
   - If the dump has not been copied into another data set, specify option 2 - `Manage the dump inventory`.
   - The dump inventory contains the dump data sets you have used. If the name of the dump you identified is in the list, delete the previous entry by typing `DD` next to it and pressing Enter. Then press F3 to return to the DUMP ANALYSIS MENU.

3. **Select a Dump:**
   - Specify option 3 - `Select a dump`, to select the dump you want to work with.
   - Type the name of the data set containing the dump in the Source field, check that `NOPRINT` and `TERMINAL` are specified in the Message Routing field, and press Enter.
   - Press F3 to return to the DUMP ANALYSIS MENU.

#### 5. Analyzing the Dump
Once you have selected a dump, you can use the other options on the menu to analyze the data in different parts of the dump:

- **Option 4:** Display a list of all address spaces active at the time the dump was taken.
- **Option 5:** Display the symptom string.
- **Option 6:** Display the symptom string and other serviceability information, including the variable recording area of the system diagnostic work area (SDWA).
- **Option 7:** Format and display the data contained in the in-storage LOGREC buffer.
- **Option 8:** Format and display the dump. The FORMAT AND DISPLAY THE DUMP panel will be displayed.

#### 6. Formatting the Dump
- **Use the Summary Dump?** Specify whether you want IBM MQ to use the information contained in the summary portion when formatting the selected dump.
- **Subsystem Name:** Identify the subsystem with the dump data you want to display. This is only required if there is no summary data or if you have specified `NO` in the `Use the summary dump?` field.
- **Address Space Identifier:** If the data in a dump comes from more than one address space, specify the identifier (ASID) for the address space you want to examine.

#### 8. Formatting an IBM MQ for z/OS Dump
- **IPCS VERBEXIT CSQWDMP:** Invokes the IBM MQ for z/OS dump formatting program (CSQWDPRD) and enables you to format an SVC dump to display IBM MQ data.
- **Keywords for the IBM MQ for z/OS dump formatting control statement:** Table 17 explains each keyword that you can specify in the control statement for formatting dumps.
- **Resource manager dump formatting keywords:** Table 18 details the dump formatting keywords that you can use to format the data relating to individual resource managers.

By following these steps and using the appropriate commands and panels, you can effectively process and analyze IBM MQ dumps on z/OS.
