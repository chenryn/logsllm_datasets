User: I have a python file and I am running the file.  
If Windows is shutdown and booted up again, how I can run that file every time Windows starts?
Assistant: click Win+R

type shell:startup

drag and drop your python file my_script.py

if you don't need the console:
change extension from my_script.py to my_script.pyw
else:
create run_my_script.cmd with content: python path\to\your\my_script.py
