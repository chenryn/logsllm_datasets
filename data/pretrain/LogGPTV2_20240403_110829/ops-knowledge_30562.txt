User: How to achieve fault tolerance and failover in a cluster? Please provide at least two feasible solutions and give their implementation methods.
Assistant: Solution 1: Master-slave replication Master-slave replication is a common fault tolerance and failover scheme, which implements fault tolerance and failover through a combination of a master node and multiple slave nodes. When the master node fails, the slave node will automatically receive the workload of the master node and become the new master node to resume normal operation. The steps to implement master-slave replication are as follows: 1. Select one node as the master node and other nodes as slave nodes. 2. Configure replication on the master node to record the change operation in the binary log. 3. Configure the slave node to connect to the master node, and perform data replication and update. 4. Monitor the running status of the master node. When the master node fails, the slave node will automatically take over and become the new master node. Solution 2: Load Balancing Load balancing is another common solution to achieve fault tolerance and failover. It implements fault tolerance and failover by distributing workload in the cluster. When a node fails, load balancing will automatically transfer the node's workload to other nodes. The steps to achieve load balancing are as follows: 1. Select a load balancer and deploy it on a node in the cluster. 2. Distribute all workloads to the load balancer and distribute them to the nodes in the cluster. 3. Monitor the status of each node in the cluster. When a node fails, load balancing will automatically redistribute the node's workload to other nodes.
