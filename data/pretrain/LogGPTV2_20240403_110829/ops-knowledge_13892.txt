User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Not able to SSH to Ubuntu after reboot Today we decided that the best course of action for our Ubuntu Server (VPS) would be to restore a back-up after too many settings had be changed to our Geoserver instance. However, after restoring the back-up and rebooting, I am no longer able to login to the server by normal means via SSH. It simply gives me a connection timed out error.
What I have done:

Used the &quot;Rescue System&quot; to login to the Server via SSH (worked).
Checked the sshd_config file and init.d/ssh for anything out of the
ordinary.
Checked the auth log to see if it even noticed my SSH    connection
attempt (which it did not).

I am completely stumped on this case. To me, it just seems like the network doesn't go up at all after a reboot. However, I am unable to directly connect to the server as it is a Virtual Private Server hosted remotely.
I've searched a bit around the web, but nobody seems to get the &quot;Connection timed out&quot; error which is happening to me right now.
The server runs on Ubuntu 14.04
Any suggestions?
Additional note:
I can only connect to the server when it is in Emergency Mode, which means it skips everything I did on the server and puts it in a /repair directory.
So if I, for example, check which ports are open, it will tell me the ports that are open from the Emergency Mode, not from my own installation.
Additional info from comments:
iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target         prot opt source                 destination
Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target         prot opt source                 destination
Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target         prot opt source                 destination

Assistant: check if the server is able to ping its default gateway
check if the ping works to server from outside
if ping works , then do a tcpdump on the interface to check if the NIC on the server is receiving any traffic 
try ssh from with in the server -- ssh localhost #if this does not work - sshd itself might be broken
