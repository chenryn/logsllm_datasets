distributions for both the number of requests and the number of bytes sent by
the servers. The vast majority of requests are received for image content (mainly
jpg), whereas the majority of bytes are attributed to the delivery of video content
(mp4). In total, 63.4% of bytes transferred are attributable to video content,
yet they constitute only 19.9% of requests. Closer inspection conﬁrms that the
dominance of images is driven by thumbnails, which makes the video portal
image-heavy. We conjecture that these may be used heavily when browsing, due
to the primarily visual nature of the content.
Video Duration. The above suggests that the majority of accesses are actu-
ally driven by non-video material. Despite this, due to its voluminous nature,
the quantity of bytes transferred is dominated by video content. Hence, we next
inspect the duration of video content available. We take this from the web scrape
information, which includes the video duration. Figure 1b presents the duration
of videos on the website, as reported by the video metadata. The majority of
videos (80%) fall below 16 min, with a mean duration of 920 s. For completeness,

categories. Note “All” refers to all content within any category.
we also plot the duration for videos within the top 5 most popular categories.
Note for ethical reasons, we anonymize all categories. The shortest videos fall
into the C3 category, with a mean of 657 s. This particular category of mate-
rial focuses primarily all more homemade content. In contrast, the C1 category
(which contains more professional material) has a longer mean duration (1086 s).
That said, these categories show strong similarities in their distribution, showing
a bias towards shorter content items.
View Counts. We next seek to explore the popularity distribution of the
resources within our logs. Figure 2a presents the CDF of the number of requests
we observe per-object, taken from the CDN logs. We observe a clear skew, where
the majority of accesses are accumulated by a small number of videos: The top
10% of videos contribute 73.7% of all accesses.
This, however, can be deceptive as videos are quite diverse (e.g.,
in terms of
duration), and many of the objects downloaded are non-video. Hence, Fig. 2b
complements these results by presenting the CDF of the number of chunks
requested per video. Each chunk represents a subset of the overall video con-
tent. This provides insight into the number of sub-requests triggered by each
video being consumed: By deﬁnition, longer videos will generate more chunk
requests. Again, we separate chunks into their respective anonymized categories.
We see that the vast majority of video fetches result in under 10 chunks being
served. Initially, one might assume that this is simply because the videos are
short. However, we ﬁnd that the low fetch rates are also driven by user skipping
and cancellations, leading to only subsets of a video’s chunks be downloaded. We
revisit this observation in Sect. 5.
Category Aﬃnity. The above has shown that there are subtle diﬀerences
between categories of content, e.g.,
in terms of duration. A complicating factor
is that many videos are tagged by multiple categories. On average, each video has
7 category tags. Hence, we next brieﬂy test the coexistence between categories
to identify commonly paired tags. To quantify this, we compute the fraction of
the pair-wise coexistence of the top 6 categories and present the results as a
heatmap in Fig. 3a. To compute this, we calculate the fraction of videos from

each category that also are tagged with another category. For completeness,
Fig. 3b also normalizes the fraction based on the total number of videos. We
conﬁrm that there are varying levels of category co-location. In some cases, co-
location is quite high, e.g., 29.4% of videos tagged as C2 are also tagged a C3. In
contrast, other categories are far less co-located, e.g.,
less than 5% of C1 videos
are co-located with C3. There are certain intuitive reasons for this, driven by
the semantic nature of the categories. We posit that this may oﬀer insight into
how things like predictive caching could be introduced to such platforms.
5 Characterisation of Per-Session Journey
We have so far revealed a workload dominated by image and video content, as
well as patterns which suggest that users rarely consume entire videos. Thus, we
next proceed to focus on the behavior of individual sessions.
5.1
Intra-video Access Journeys
We ﬁrst dive into the intra-video access patterns of sessions. Our focus is on
understanding how users move between chunks within a single video.

273
Access Duration. We ﬁrst explore the duration of time each user session
dedicates to an individual video. Note that this is diﬀerent to Fig. 1b, which
is based on the video duration, rather than the access duration. To compute
this, for each video access, we extract the diﬀerence between the ﬁrst and last
timestamp seen for chunks of the same video. For instance, if the ﬁrst chunk of a
video were requested at t1, and the ﬁnal chunk were requested as t2, we estimate
the duration as t2−t1. This oﬀers an approximation of access duration, although
we highlight that the downloading of a chunk does not necessarily mean it is
viewed.
Figure 4a presents the results as a CDF. This shows markedly diﬀerent trends
to that of Fig. 1b (which depicts the duration of the content). As expected, we
ﬁnd that access durations are far shorter than the underlying content duration
that is being consumed. There are also subtle diﬀerences between the categories;
for example, the average access duration for content within the C1 category is
1086 s vs. 657 s for C3 content. Around 80% of C1 videos are consumed for under
1000 s, whereas this is closer to 90% for C3 videos. To complement this, Fig. 4b
presents a CDF of the number of bytes sent per [video, session] pair. Each data
point represents the number of bytes downloaded for each request (note one
session may generate multiple requests, even for the same resource). This shows
a rather diﬀerent trends, with the around 90% of fetches resulting in under 107
bytes being sent.
Overall, both plots reveal that the majority of videos only have only a subset
of their content chunks fetched. It is worth noting that, even though videos
rarely download all their chunks, we do ﬁnd that requests for individual chunks
are usually completed. 82% of individual chunk requests involve downloading in
excess of 90% of bytes, whilst only 4% download under 10% of bytes.
Cancellations and Skip Rates. The fact that many videos are not down-
loaded in their entirety is driven by a combination of two factors: (i) viewers
canceling video streams; and (ii) viewers skipping across video streams.
To get an idea of how many videos are watched sequentially, and then can-
celed towards the end, we compute the fraction of streams that request the ﬁrst
90% of chunks, but lack the last 10%. We ﬁnd that under 1% experience this, sug-
gesting that early cancellations and skips are most prevalent. Figure 4c presents
the skip rate of blocks. A skipped block is counted when the byte range is not
directly adjacent to the previous block high range. For example, a contiguous
block is: “100–200” and “201–300”, whereas a skipped block is “100–200” and
then “501–600”. We observe that some videos have extremely high skip ratios
(i.e., above 0.8). This conﬁrms that viewers skip extensively within videos, and
rarely download all chunks contiguously. This has a dramatic impact on our ear-
lier results. To quantify this, we subset all videos to leave those containing at
least one skip (and remove any anomalous blocks as mentioned previously). This
leaves all videos served that have at least one skip—this covers a 75.4% of the
total requests, conﬁrming that the majority of videos do include skips. This is
likely to diﬀer from long-play Video-on-Demand platforms (e.g., Netﬂix) where
users more likely view streams contiguously.

5.2
Inter-video Access Journeys
The next aspect we inspect is how sessions move between videos.
Video Load Points. We ﬁrst inspect which pages tend to drive the majority of
video views. We conjecture that diﬀerent viewers might have diﬀerent patterns
in this regard. To extract this information, we identify the HTTP Referrer in
each request; from this, we take the previous page the resources was loaded from.
We then map this to the page and type of object that has triggered the resource
request. Figure 5a presents the overall distribution of videos watched from a page
that users are visiting within the portal. Note that we anonymize category pages
again. The majority of resources are watched from the Video Homepage (each
video has its own page). This captures over 55% of unique videos accumulating
65.5% of bytes delivered on the site. That said, we also observe a notable quantity
of material embedded within the Site Homepage and from the Search Page. For
instance, around 45.5% of video visits come from Site Homepage. Interestingly
37% of the videos are referred from the Search Page but amassing just 5% of the
traﬃc. The remaining referrals are from various sub-pages within the site, most
notably several popular category pages.
Looking at this distribution in isolation, however, is insuﬃcient to gain van-
tage into a sessions journey. This is because, as previously observed, videos are
not always viewed in their entirety. To explore this further, Fig. 5b presents the
Dissecting the Workload of a Major Adult Video Portal
275
Fig. 5. (a) Where the videos are watched the most: 95.67% of videos are watched from
either the main page of the video, the homepage of the site and the search page (b)
Where the videos are loaded the most: Y-axis gives the ratio of bytes out and total
ﬁle size (somewhat indicating what proportion of video has been watched) across users

fraction of bytes loaded across the various referrers previously discussed. For clar-
ity, we list only the top pages observed. The median is relatively stable across
most pages, however, there are key diﬀerences. For example, 45.69% of views
from the homepage of the site result in under 25% of video bytes actually being
loaded. This might indicate that content accessed from the front page is rarely
done with great thought. Rather, users might informally click on videos on the
chance that they might be of interest. Similarly, just 5% of video bytes are con-
sumed when redirected from the search page, suggesting that users may load a
large number of videos in the hope of ﬁnding a speciﬁc one (before canceling).
We will seek to verify these conjectures in our future work.
