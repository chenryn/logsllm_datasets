• Okay, it was just after Mardi Gras
• My wife came home with 50 lbs. of beads
• I didn’t want them kicking around the 
house for the next 10 years
• So, I did what any normal person would

• I created a SHMOOCON crypto contest
– Using the beads, of course.  :)

– 66 gold bead strings

– Thus, anyone wearing red knew the solution
• But those who were competing might not help others…
• We placed copies of the following messages in
