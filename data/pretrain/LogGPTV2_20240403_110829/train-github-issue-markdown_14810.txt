While querying the GitHub API, I encountered an error (403) with the following message:

```json
{
  "message": "API rate limit exceeded for 180.253.11.147. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)",
  "documentation_url": "https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting"
}
```

Additionally, I was directed to this URL: [https://deno.land/x/accepts](https://deno.land/x/accepts).

To resolve this issue, you should consider authenticating your requests to increase the rate limit. For more information, please refer to the [GitHub API rate limiting documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting).
