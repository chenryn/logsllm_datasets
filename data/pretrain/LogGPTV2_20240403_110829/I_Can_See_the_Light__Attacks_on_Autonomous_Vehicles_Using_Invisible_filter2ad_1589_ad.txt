6 POTENTIAL SOLUTION
In this section, we propose a lightweight lCSL Attack detection mod-
ule to defend against ICSL Attack without requiring any hardware
modifications by utilizing a unique feature of IR light.
6.1 Unique Features of IR Light
Since the IR light shows a legitimate magenta color in AV’s cam-
era, the camera cannot distinguish if the magenta color is from a
legitimate visible light or from the IR light source, which makes it
challenging to defend against ICSL Attack. Intuitively, it is possible
to implement IR filters on the camera to defend against ICSL. Attack.
However, IR filters will introduce severe disadvantages, including i)
high implementation cost, and ii) filtering out useful information.
i) High implementation cost. Each AV uses at least 6 cameras
(3 front cameras, 2 side cameras, and 1 rear camera) to perform
autonomous driving. Since the price of each camera is around

$1000 while the price of the IR filter is around $100 to $150 [18,
26], the hardware cost will be increased by 10% to 15%. For the
AV companies, it is important to reduce the cost to win the ever-
increasing competition in the autonomous driving field.
ii) Filtering out useful information. The autonomous driving
systems rely on the IR light intensity, exposure value and tone curve
from the IR light to make the decision, especially under severe light-
ing scenarios (i.e., strong sunlight, high ambient light noise, etc.).
Moreover, the front and side cameras of the AV (i.e., Tesla Model
3 and Tesla Model S, etc.) are RCCB or RCCC cameras. Different
from traditional RGGB cameras, these cameras are designed for
computer vision and very sensitive to red and blue color. Since most
of the light sources (i.e., moonlight, vehicle light, halogen lamp, etc.)
also emit IR light energy. By detecting IR lights, RCCB or RCCC
cameras will significantly reduce the exposure time, increase the
camera dynamic range and the camera performance at night. How-
ever, filtering out the IR light will reduce the night performance of
RCCC or RCCB cameras.
In this work, instead of requiring hardware modifications, we
leverage a unique feature of IR light to defend against ICSL Attack.
Specifically, since the IR light absorption rate is higher than the
visible light [19, 55], when the IR light reaches a surface of an object,
most of its energy will be absorbed while the reflected energy will
be low. Therefore, it is difficult for the camera to detect the
IR light reflected from the surface of an object. To prove the
concept, we conduct experiments to compare the reflected visible
magenta color lights and 850𝑛𝑚 IR lights from walls with different
colors. As shown in Figure 14 (a) and (c), when visible magenta color
lights are transmitted to the wall, the camera can still detect the
reflected lights. In addition, the detected light color is also changing
according to the color of the wall. On the other hand, most of the
850𝑛𝑚 IR lights are absorbed by the wall. The camera cannot detect
the reflected IR lights from the wall and the wall shows its original
color. According to this unique feature, instead of directly detecting
the IR light source, the AV can detect ICSL Attack by detecting the
light reflected from the surface from other objects.
6.2 Overview of the Detection Module
According to the unique feature of IR light, we introduce one possi-
ble way to detect ICSL Attack. As shown in Figure 13, the proposed
detection module mainly consists of two parts: the Light Source
Detector & Filter module and the Reflection Detection module.
Light Source Detector & Filter. To defend against ICSL Attack,
the first step to is to recognize the light source. Since the wave-
length of IR light is close to 700𝑛𝑚, the color of the light shown in
the camera (magenta) is close to red. Therefore, according to the
frames captured by the camera, the detection module should also
validate the colors of the lights. If the detected colors are signifi-
cantly different from red, the corresponding light sources will be
ignored and considered as legitimate devices while the remaining
light sources will be transmitted to the reflection detection module
for further analysis.
Reflection Detection. The Reflection Detection module ana-
lyzes the remaining light sources that pass through the Light Source
Filter. Since the IR light reflected from other objects is weak and
cannot be detected by the commodity camera, the detection module
can utilize this feature to distinguish the IR light from visible light.
Specifically, the Reflection Detection module contains three parts
to analyze the reflected light:
• Material/Color Filter. Since some specific materials or objects with
specific colors have high IR light reflection factors, it is possible
for the camera to detect the IR light reflected from those objects
and misclassify those objects as light sources. For example, most of
the car paints are made of acrylic enamel or urethane [2], which
can reflect the IR light. In addition, since the bright silver color
can slightly reflect the IR light, the camera can detect the reflected
IR light at a close distance. Therefore, in this paper, the detection
module will ignore the red lights that are reflected from the body
of the vehicle or a bright color object.
• Surface Selection. Since different materials have different reflec-
tion factors [15], it is important that the detection module selects
the right surface of the object to analyze the reflected light. If the
reflected light is not detected, then the corresponding light source
should be considered as the IR light source.
• Color Analysis. Based on the color and intensity of the reflected
lights, the detection module should match reflected lights to the
corresponding light sources. Since the color of the surface will affect
the color of the reflected visible light, the detection module should
also recognize the reflected visible light even if the reflected light
color is not the same as the color of light source.

sources may have different configurations. For example, a traffic
light can be suspended or supported. In addition, the viewing angle
will also differ with the position of the car and the elevation of
the light. To get the best result, we applied a convolutional neural
network for traffic light recognition. The structure of the network
is shown in Figure 15.
We applied a two-dimensional convolution layer to the input,
which consists of 32 filters. The output featuremap was fed into a
maximum pooling layer to eliminate the difference made by location
and rotation. Then, an activation layer with the ReLu function
was adopted to process each of the pooled featuremaps. After the
activation layer, a flatten layer reduced the dimension of the last
output for the following dense layer. The dense layer converts
the problem into a regular deeply connected neural network layer.
Then, a softmax activation layer gives the light source detection
output. At last, a color filter is implemented based on the color
threshold in order to filter out the light source that is not close to
the red color. During the experiment, we combined three datasets to
train the model. The first dataset is the Bosch Night dataset [7] and
the second is the Kitti dataset [28], which are famous and widely
used in autonomous vehicle experiments. The third dataset is the
dataset we self-recorded while driving the vehicle in a downtown
area and in an indoor parking lot.
6.3.2 Reflection Detection. The first step of reflection detection is
to filter out the potential materials or objects that may affect the
detection results. To do this, we leverage one of the most commonly
used deep learning-based object detection approaches–YOLOv5
[6, 60]. Similar to section 6.3.1, we use the Bosch Night dataset
[7], the Kitti dataset [28] and the self-recorded dataset to train the
detection model. In order to filter out the bright color objects, a
threshold-based color filter is also implemented.
Then, the key step of reflection detection is to choose the proper
reflection surface for detection. As stated before, we need to choose
a surface that reflects visible red light instead of IR light. The most
ideal surface would be the road since the concrete or pitch surface
absorbs the IR light but reflects the visible light. In the meantime,
we need to rule out the surface of other cars since their paint would
reflect IR light.
The next step is color analysis. Matching the reflected light to
the light source is challenging, since there could be multiple light
sources that pass the Light Source Detector & Filter module. To
overcome this challenge, we leverage the fact that although those
lights sources are transmitting red lights, the colors and light in-
tensities detected by the camera are different. This is because the

detected colors and light intensities are affected by the position,
distance, and angle of view of the autonomous vehicle. Since the
camera is much more sensitive than the human eyes, the detected
light sources will show slightly different colors (i.e., crimson, ma-
genta and maroon, etc) with different light intensities. Therefore,
by matching the reflected light to the light source according to
the colors and intensities, we can find the remaining light sources,
which can be categorized as IR light sources.
The workflow of our reflection detection is shown in Figure 16.
We first apply the Material/Color Filter object recognition to rule
out the special materials and the objects with special colors. Then,
to improve the detection accuracy, we also rule out the objects
with smooth surfaces, such as road signs and mirrors. Then the IR
non-reflecting surfaces are picked. During the experiment, the road
surface is always the first choice, since the position, color, and area
are easy to identify.
On the IR non-reflecting surfaces, we apply a threshold to pick
out the area of reflection. The threshold is dynamically determined
based on the position of the light source. Since the light source is
already recognized, we can find out the reflection of light by using
color matching. Finally, if we get a solid reflection, we take it as the
legitimate light source. Otherwise, the detection module can send
alerts to the driver.
6.4 Experiment Results
As shown in Figure 17, we study the proposed defense strategy by
plotting Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the
Light Source Detector & Filter, the Material/Color Filter, and the
Combined Detection Module. We also calculate the corresponding
Area Under the ROC Curves (AUC) to analyze the performance of
the detection module. The block dot line in this figure serves as the
reference line to represent the performance of random guessing
(AUC = 0.5).
As we can observe from Figure 17, the Light Source Detector
& Filter performs well during the experiment (AUC = 0.99). This
module provides the reliable light source information for the de-
tection module to recognize the light sources and filter out the
light that is not close to the red color. The Material/Color Filter in
the Reflection Detection module also performs well (AUC = 0.99),
which can effectively recognize and filter out the special materials
and objects with special colors. The overall AUC of the proposed

alarm light, etc.) may be spoofed by the ICSL Attack.
Does not require any specific designed hardware. Instead of
requiring specifically designed hardware, we mainly utilize the
off-the-shelf IR light LEDs to implement the ICSL Attack, which
is cheap (around $8/each) and can be purchased by anyone. As a
result, the attacker can easily and effectively attack the autonomous
vehicle with very little hardware or software knowledge.
7.2 Attack Stealthiness
The stealthiness of the proposed attack is guaranteed as long as
the human cannot see the IR light. However, as mentioned in pre-
vious sections, the implementation process of ICSL Attack may
increase the risks of exposing the identity of the attacker. Specifi-
cally, to create a fake traffic light, the attacker should implement
the IR light sources on the traffic signal before the autonomous
vehicle detects the signal. This suspicious process will significantly
increase the possibilities of being detected by pedestrians or police
officers. Therefore, it is important for the attacker to conduct the
implementation process during the night to mitigate the potential
risks of being seen by others. To introduce environment perception
error, the attacker should drive the vehicle in front of the target
