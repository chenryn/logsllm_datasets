User: I haven't changed any code, but when I try to upload an image file using the GCS Client library on app engine's dev server, I am now getting this fatal error:
Expect status [201] from Google Storage. But got status 400.
This was working until I made the update from Google to 1.8.8 as of 11/19/13.
Anybody else seeing this? It doesn't give any other indications as to why the 400 error.
Assistant: have you updated gcs client to 1.8.8 version from the downloads list, or to SVN head? Thanks.
