I have not made any changes to the code, but I am now encountering a fatal error when attempting to upload an image file using the Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Client library on the App Engine development server. The error message I receive is:

"Expect status [201] from Google Storage. But got status 400."

This functionality was working correctly until I updated to version 1.8.8 of the GCS client on November 19, 2013. The error message does not provide any additional information as to why a 400 Bad Request error is being returned.

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Additionally, could you please confirm if you have updated to the 1.8.8 version from the official downloads list or to the latest SVN head? Thank you.
