Not sure if this is intentional or not but when a form is posted, the order in
which they are posted is not taken into account.
Basically, I want to have a collection of input fields which will be
drag/drop. The user will enter text in the input field and then may decide
they want to drag it above a previous input field.
If one of the input fields fails validation the form is displayed along with
the errors. However, the input fields are no longer in the order they were
posted.
