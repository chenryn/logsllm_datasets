which makes EASI relevant for these areas as well. In addition,
since the bandwidth provided by CAN will not be sufﬁcient for
future developments, CAN-FD [54] was introduced in 2012.
CAN-FD enables an increased bandwidth of up to 2.5 Mbit/s
in the automotive sector [22] and a payload between 8 and 64
bytes per message. Since the functionality remains unchanged,
the proposed approach is also suitable for the next development
stage of CAN. The higher payload also increases the number
of rising edges, which can be used to reduce the sample rate.
IX. CONCLUSION
Intrusion Detection Systems are a promising technology
to increase security in connected vehicles. Due to the missing
sender identiﬁcation of the CAN, the most used bus system, the
IDSs miss the important information from which ECU received
messages were sent. Also the evolution, CAN-FD, which will
be introduced with the next vehicle generation, does not change
this and can therefore beneﬁt from this information as well.
Besides the automotive sector, CAN is also used in other areas,
such as automation, medicine and rail. The approach presented
in this paper allows the sender to be identiﬁed by differences
in signal characteristics caused by hardware. The evaluation
based on a prototype and two production vehicles proved
that a sender identiﬁcation of over 99.9 % is also possible
with resource-constrained hardware. Thus, it could also be
shown for the ﬁrst time that classiﬁcation is also possible at
low cost on the basis of comprehensive signal characteristics,
while real-time requirements could be met. This was mainly
achieved by strong simpliﬁcations of the individual phases, the
reduced sampling rate and the small amount of data which has
to be processed by the system. Nevertheless, we were able
to further increase the identiﬁcation rates, as the presented
approach focuses on the characteristics which contain the most
information for sender identiﬁcation. In addition, we have
speciﬁed an update approach and shown by simulation that
it is able to adapt the model to potential changes. Besides
attacks using compromised ECUs, the presented IDS is also
able to detect intrusions by unmonitored and additional ECUs.
It was also demonstrated to be robust against attackers who
can inﬂuence the voltage level of compromised ECUs and
the energy supply of the vehicle. Finally, we did a one-week
test drive to demonstrate the robustness of the system under
changing conditions and active consumers. Considering that
an attacker can control all vehicle functions as soon as he has
access to the internal communication, the approach presented
here offers considerable potential for increasing the security
and thus the safety of connected vehicles. Overall, EASI is the
ﬁrst sender identiﬁcation approach exploiting comprehensive
signal characteristics which enables the implementation on a
realistic automotive platform.
