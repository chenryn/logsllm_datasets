Table IV shows the types of devices identiﬁed by port. The
devices we identiﬁed were primarily network-attached storage
(NAS) appliances, home routers, cameras, DVRs, printers, and
media streamers. This composition of device types is consistent
with the composition reported in an earlier study on global
Mirai infection [1], suggesting our ﬁndings are not driven by
selection bias in the types of devices that were affected and
remediated.
Device type does seem to inﬂuence the infection time.
Figure 8 shows the survival curves for the top 5 most common
types of devices in our study. The results show that around
50% of the DVRs and cameras remain still infected, while
only 20% of the infected routers and NAS appliances were
infected after 14 days. While these overall remediation rates
per device type seem to indicate that some devices are easier to
clean, the survival curves did not show signiﬁcant differences
(log-rank test, χ2 = 7.1, p − value = 0.1).
Figure 8: Cleanup rates for the top 5 device types
Interestingly, the composition of device types was different
9
for the business network compared to the two consumer
networks (see Figure 9). Routers, security cameras and video-
conferencing hardware were more common in the business
networks, while storage units and DVR were mainly present
in the customer and subsidiary networks. This supports our
earlier speculation that the natural remediation rate is indeed
tied to the usage patterns of the devices. Remember that the
natural remediation rate in the business network was lower. We
now see that indeed this concerns a different device population.
More of these devices are likely to be always-on for business
continuity reasons. If rebooting or unplugging occurs less
frequently, there is also less opportunity for natural remediation
to occur.

G. Lab testing of cleanup and reinfection
In addition to the observational study and the randomized
controlled experiment, we also conducted a series of in-lab
tests with actual vulnerable devices. These simple tests aim
to test the assumption that Mirai malware was indeed not
persistent and to also shed some light on reinfection.
The test environment consisted of 7 vulnerable devices
(1 IP camera, 1 printer, 1 home router, 3 network storage
units, and 1 satellite TV receiver) in their default state (i.e.,
with their network ports open, and able to accept default
credentials). We infected them with a Mirai binary captured
by the honeypot. Once infected, we connected the devices to
the public Internet and logged all the incoming/outgoing trafﬁc.
After malicious outgoing trafﬁc was observed in the infected
devices, we rebooted them. Our results showed that after the
restart there were no signs of infection in any of these devices:
(i) no suspicious process was running after the reboot; and (ii)
no malicious communication trafﬁc was observed. However,
even though the binary was not running in any of the devices,
we did ﬁnd it in the ﬁle system of one of the devices as this
device was using a non-volatile storage and the presence of
the malware ﬁle survived the reboot.
These results are in line with previous studies [31] which
also demonstrated the non-persistent nature of Mirai infections.
(While [1] did report some persistence, this appears to be
related to binaries for X86-64, so non-IoT.) In general, our
ﬁndings conﬁrm the advice to consumers to reboot the device,
though this alone does not resolve the underlying vulnerability.
As long as non-persistence is the norm, rebooting will remain
effective. As recent as May 2018, the FBI issued a global

population of devices compromised with VPNFilter. Of course
all of this, including the high remediation rates we reported
earlier in this section, will change when attackers ﬁnd a way
to gain a more persistent foothold on the devices. There are
early signs that this is happening [5].
Next, we investigated the reinfection rate, i.e., the time it
takes to infect a device, that was cleaned, again. To this end,
we connected the devices back to the Internet after rebooting
them and monitored the outbound trafﬁc to see whether they
get reinfected. We conducted the same procedure three times
for each device. Table V shows the average reinfection speed
per device. Five out of six devices got reinfected within
an hour after being rebooted. This high reinfection rate is
consistent with the aggressive scanning behavior of Mirai. One
vulnerable device did not get reinfected. A closer analysis of
the trafﬁc showed that indeed there were infection attempts
but the implementation of the telnet service denied any login
attempt for 30 minutes after an unsuccessful login attempt.
The aggressive scanning behavior together with the timeout of
the telnet service served as an impediment to reinfection.

These results have two implications for our study. First,
it underlines the validity of the conservative approach that
we took in measuring remediation. Our tracking methodology
did not allow us to measure reinfections on a granularity of
minutes. This means it is not feasible to distinguish infection
from reinfection. It makes more sense to collate the different
infection observations over time into a more or less persistent
status of being infected.
Second, and more important, this aggressive reinfection
behavior means that if we do not see a device for 21 or more
consecutive days (our extended tracking period, see Section
IV-D),
then some remediation action was taken that goes
beyond a mere reboot. No vulnerable device with a direct
connection to the Internet would survive that long without
reinfection.
VI. USER EXPERIENCES
Our experimental results show remarkably high remedia-
tion rates, especially for the improved walled garden notiﬁca-
tion. While this is a hopeful result, it is also truly puzzling.
We know from prior work that remediation is difﬁcult for end
users, even for the more conventional scenario of cleaning up
PC-based malware (see related work, Section VII). In this
scenario, it is easier for the user to identify the offending
device and the ISP can tell the user more precisely what steps
she or he needs to take and point to readily available tools to
automatically detect and remove the infection. In other words,
the notiﬁcation is much more actionable for the user.
Compared to the conventional scenario, remediating IoT
malware seems much more difﬁcult for users. Even in our
improved notiﬁcation we cannot tell the user which of their
devices is affected or even what type of device they should
look for and disinfect. Next,
there are no tools available
for disinfection. Finally, remediation actions vary greatly per
device type, vendor, local conﬁguration, etc. Absent all of this
information, the notiﬁcation is limited to describing several
rather generic actions.
And yet, we ﬁnd very high clean-up rates – higher, in fact,
than the rate for PC infections. We have a direct point of
comparison from a prior study conducted recently also at a
European mid-sized ISP [6].
The high remediation rate puts a premium on better un-
derstanding how users responded to the notiﬁcation. In this
section, we analyze data on the user experience of IoT cleanup
collected via phone interviews and the communication logs of
the ISP.
A. Phone interviews
We called 173 customers to invite them to participate in
a short telephone interview. This includes all customers in
the observational study and the experimental study, except for
the customers in the control group and 4 customers who had
terminated their contract in the time between the treatment and
the interview.
In total, 76 (44%) of the customers accepted the invitation.
The response rate was nearly the same in each treatment group.
The non-response consisted of customers who did not want to
participate (20, 12%), or who could not be reached by phone
within several attempts (77, 44%).

We ﬁrst asked participants if they remembered receiving
the notiﬁcation and, if so, if they remembered reading it.
Nearly all customers in the walled garden groups remembered
receiving it, compared to just around half of the customers
in the email-only group. For those customers who did not
remember receiving the notiﬁcations, we checked whether we
used the correct email address. All conﬁrmed it was correct.
In other words, the emails likely reached their inbox, but were
overlooked (or perhaps got caught in the spam ﬁlter). Most
of the customers who remembered receiving the message also
remembered reading it (See Table VI). Some of the customers
who did not read it mentioned that they did not trust the
message and wondered whether it was a phishing mail. (One
interviewee also did not trust our phone interview and thought
it was a Microsoft scam call).
We then asked the 60 customers who remembered reading
the notiﬁcation if he or she took any action and, if so, what ac-
tion. Four respondents (6.7%) said they did nothing. A further
seven (11.7%) said they had called an IT repair service and did
not know what this person had done exactly. All others listed
doing one or more of the steps mentioned in the notiﬁcation,
10
most often mentioning their attempts to identify the offending
device. Furthermore, 22 customers (36.7%) speciﬁcally stated
they had disconnected a device like a camera, DVR or NAS
device from the network. One even claimed to have thrown
the device in the trash. Also, 22 (36.7%) people mentioned
changing the password for one or more devices and 23 (38.3%)
said they reset one or more devices. One customer mentioned
conducting a ﬁrmware update. Four customers reported that
they had run an anti-virus scanner. This latter answer signals
a misunderstanding of the nature of the infection. We encoun-
tered this more frequently in the communication logs, which
we discuss below.
Next, we asked whether the customer sought additional
help for the problem. Thirteen people (21.7%) mentioned
seeking help from another person, such as their relatives or
calling the ISP’s help desk. Ten people (17%) asked the ISP
to send a paid repair person and one person contacted another
repair service. Another form of additional help is searching
the web. Five people (8.3%) used Google to ﬁnd additional
information and one person mentioned that they consulted the
website of the manufacturer of the offending device.
76 respondents were asked how conﬁdent they felt in their
ability to solve computer security issues like this. Surprisingly,
the largest number of people reported to be very conﬁdent
(34%) or fairly conﬁdent (29%). Some of these respondents
elaborated on their answer by stating that they had competent
people in their environment who they could turn to. On the
other end of the spectrum, 17% ranked themselves as not
very conﬁdent and 18% stated having no conﬁdence at all
and little to no knowledge about these issues. Several of these
people said they always ask someone else for help. Some of
the interviewees stated that they considered themselves too
old for these types of problems. We analyzed the correlation
between conﬁdence level and cleanup success and found no
relationship. It seems conﬁdence, or lack thereof, does not
predict remediation outcomes.
We ended the interview by asking all customers how the
ISP can improve its communication about these issues with
customers. This question revealed wildly different experiences.
On the positive side, 17 respondents (22%) explicitly stated
being satisﬁed or even very satisﬁed with how the ISP handled
the situation. A few suggested sending prior warnings before
quarantining the connection and to provide more speciﬁc
information on what to do and what the offending device is.
Another suggestion was to provide an option to contact abuse
staff during evenings or weekends for customers who cannot
self-release from the walled garden. On the negative side, nine
respondents (12%) expressed dissatisfaction or anger about the
process. The most vocal critics said that they had incurred
economic losses as they were running small businesses on
their consumer subscription which were interrupted by the
quarantine event.
B. Communication logs
Additional insights into the user experience of IoT cleanup
were extracted from the communication logs between the help
desk and the customers in the study, except for those in the
control group. In total, we found one or more messages for
92% of these customers in the ISP’s logs. We investigated 159
walled garden contact forms (from 90 unique customers), 404
emails (from 106 unique customers) and 117 help desk logs
(from 68 unique customers).
First, we explored the distribution of messages across the
different treatment groups (See Table VII). We found that
about a third of the customers replied to the email notiﬁcation
and only 3 customers contacted the help desk. This rate is
much higher for the walled garden groups: around 50% of
the quarantined customers called the help desk. While less
