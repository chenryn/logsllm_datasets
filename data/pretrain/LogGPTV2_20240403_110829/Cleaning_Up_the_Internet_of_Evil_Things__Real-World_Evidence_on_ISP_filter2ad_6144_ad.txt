### Device Type Distribution and Infection Rates

The following table presents the distribution of device types identified by port, along with their respective infection rates:

| Service/Device Type | Infection Rate (%) |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| FTP                 | 1.35               |
| Telnet              | 3.95               |
| HTTP                | 7.53               |
| HTTPS               | 0.42               |
| UPnP                | 0.42               |
| Alt. HTTP           | 4.78               |
| Alt. HTTPS          | 0.45               |
| Plex                | 1.35               |
| QSee DVR            | 36.15              |
| Unknown             | 64.04              |

**Device Types:**
- NAS
- Router
- Server
- Set top box
- DVR
- Camera
- Printer
- Media streamer
- Firewall

**Table IV** shows the types of devices identified by port. The devices primarily identified were network-attached storage (NAS) appliances, home routers, cameras, DVRs, printers, and media streamers. This composition is consistent with the findings from an earlier study on global Mirai infection [1], suggesting that our results are not biased by the types of devices affected and remediated.

### Influence of Device Type on Infection Time

Device type appears to influence the infection time. **Figure 8** illustrates the survival curves for the top 5 most common types of devices in our study. The results indicate that approximately 50% of DVRs and cameras remained infected, while only 20% of routers and NAS appliances were still infected after 14 days. Although these overall remediation rates suggest that some devices are easier to clean, the survival curves did not show significant differences (log-rank test, χ² = 7.1, p-value = 0.1).

### Device Type Composition Across Networks

Interestingly, the composition of device types differed between business and consumer networks. **Figure 9** shows that routers, security cameras, and video-conferencing hardware were more common in business networks, while storage units and DVRs were mainly present in consumer and subsidiary networks. This supports our hypothesis that the natural remediation rate is tied to the usage patterns of the devices. Business networks had a lower natural remediation rate, likely because many devices are always-on for business continuity, reducing opportunities for natural remediation through rebooting or unplugging.

### Lab Testing of Cleanup and Re-infection

In addition to the observational study and randomized controlled experiment, we conducted in-lab tests with actual vulnerable devices. These tests aimed to verify the non-persistent nature of Mirai malware and to shed light on re-infection.

**Test Environment:**
- 7 vulnerable devices: 1 IP camera, 1 printer, 1 home router, 3 network storage units, and 1 satellite TV receiver.
- Devices were in their default state with open network ports and default credentials.
- Infected with a Mirai binary captured by the honeypot.
- Connected to the public Internet and monitored for incoming/outgoing traffic.

**Results:**
- After rebooting, no signs of infection were observed in any of the devices:
  - No suspicious processes were running.
  - No malicious communication traffic was detected.
- However, the malware binary was found in the file system of one device using non-volatile storage, indicating the presence of the malware file survived the reboot.

These results align with previous studies [31] demonstrating the non-persistent nature of Mirai infections. Our findings confirm the advice to consumers to reboot the device, though this alone does not resolve the underlying vulnerability. As long as non-persistence is the norm, rebooting remains effective. The FBI issued a similar advisory in May 2018 for dealing with VPNFilter-infected devices [14].

### Re-infection Rate

We investigated the re-infection rate, i.e., the time it takes for a cleaned device to be reinfected. After rebooting, the devices were reconnected to the Internet, and outbound traffic was monitored. The procedure was repeated three times for each device. **Table V** shows the average re-infection speed per device type.

| Device Type             | Mean Time to Re-infection |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| IP camera               | 19min 0sec                |
| Printer                 | 1min 50sec                |
| Router                  | 14min 35sec               |
| NAS 1                   | 47min 9sec                |
| NAS 2                   | 37min 47sec               |
| NAS 3                   | 5min 35sec                |
| Satellite TV Receiver   | No infection for 48 hours |

Five out of six devices were reinfected within an hour after being rebooted, consistent with Mirai's aggressive scanning behavior. One device did not get reinfected due to a 30-minute timeout of the telnet service after an unsuccessful login attempt.

### Implications for the Study

1. **Validation of Remediation Measurement:**
   - Our tracking methodology did not allow for minute-level measurement of re-infections, making it challenging to distinguish between initial infection and re-infection. It makes more sense to consider the persistent status of being infected over time.

2. **Aggressive Re-infection Behavior:**
   - If a device is not seen for 21 or more consecutive days, it suggests that a remediation action beyond a simple reboot was taken. No vulnerable device with a direct connection to the Internet would survive that long without re-infection.

### User Experiences

Our experimental results show high remediation rates, especially for the improved walled garden notification. This is puzzling given the difficulty of remediating IoT malware for end users. Unlike PC-based malware, where users can more easily identify and clean the affected device, IoT malware is more challenging due to the lack of specific tools and varying remediation actions per device type, vendor, and local configuration.

### Phone Interviews

We conducted phone interviews with 173 customers, resulting in 76 (44%) responses. The response rate was nearly the same across treatment groups. Non-responses included customers who did not want to participate (20, 12%) or could not be reached (77, 44%).

**Table VI: Respondents receiving and reading the notification**

| Experimental Group     | Total | Received | Read | Distrust |
|------------------------|-------|----------|------|----------|
| Email-only             | 16    | 8 (50.00%) | 42 (95.20%) | 6 (37.50%) |
| Walled garden (improved)| 18    | 18 (100%) | 40 (95.20%) | 6 (37.50%) |
| Walled garden (standard)| 18    | 18 (100%) | 36 (85.70%) | 2 (12.50%) |

Most customers in the walled garden groups remembered receiving the notification, while only about half in the email-only group did. Most who received the message also read it. Some customers who did not read it expressed distrust, mistaking it for phishing.

**Actions Taken:**
- 60 customers who read the notification took various actions, such as identifying the offending device, disconnecting it, changing passwords, resetting devices, and updating firmware.
- 13 sought additional help from relatives, the ISP’s help desk, or other repair services.
- 5 used Google to find additional information.

**Confidence Levels:**
- 34% felt very confident, and 29% felt fairly confident in solving computer security issues.
- 17% felt not very confident, and 18% had no confidence and little knowledge.
- Confidence levels did not correlate with cleanup success.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Positive feedback: 17 respondents were satisfied with the ISP’s handling.
- Suggestions: Send prior warnings, provide more specific information, and offer evening/weekend support.
- Negative feedback: 9 respondents expressed dissatisfaction, particularly those running small businesses on consumer subscriptions.

### Communication Logs

Additional insights were extracted from communication logs between the help desk and customers. We analyzed 159 walled garden contact forms, 404 emails, and 117 help desk logs.

**Message Distribution:**
- About a third of customers replied to the email notification, and only 3 contacted the help desk.
- For the walled garden groups, around 50% of quarantined customers called the help desk.

This data provides a comprehensive view of user experiences and the effectiveness of different notification methods in facilitating IoT cleanup.
