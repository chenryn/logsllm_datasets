Question: "A mobile application uses JWT for stateless authentication. The server issues these tokens after validating user credentials. Which of the following practices should be implemented to ensure the security of the JWT-based authentication system?"
 "A": "The payload of the JWT must contain sensitive user data to ensure user identification for each request."
 "B": "A 'none' algorithm should be used in the JWT header to indicate that the token's integrity is verified."
 "C": "The JWT should include an 'exp' claim to indicate the expiration time, and the server must reject expired tokens."
 "D": "The secret used for the token's HMAC computation should be stored on the client side for token validation purposes."
Answer: C
