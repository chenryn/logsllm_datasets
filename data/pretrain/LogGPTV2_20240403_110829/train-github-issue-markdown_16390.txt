Under numexpr 2.2.2 (and for some reason that's the latest version available
in the anaconda distribution at the moment), I get the following kind of
errors:
    >>> data.shape
    (2, 219, 104, 6)
    >>> data.dtype
    dtype('float64')
    >>> df = pd.Panel(data[0]).to_frame().reset_index()
    >>> df[0].dtype
    dtype('float64')
    >>> df[0].count()
    711
    >>> df[0] + 1
    TypeError: Could not operate 1 with block values using `oa_ndim == 0` when `op_axes` is NULL is 
    deprecated. Use `oa_ndim == -1` or the MultiNew iterator for NumPy <1.8 compatibility
Looks like the same as here and here.
Upgrading to numexpr 2.3 solves it. Should v2.3 be then strictly required by
pandas?
