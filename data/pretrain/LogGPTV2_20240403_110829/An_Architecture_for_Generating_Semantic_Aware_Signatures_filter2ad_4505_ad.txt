### Clustering Similarity Threshold Analysis

In the formulas, \( Pk \in J |ck| \geq |c| \) and \( Pk \in J |Ck| \geq |C| \) are used because sessions may have multiple conjectures. Figure 7 presents graphs indicating how precision and recall vary with the clustering similarity threshold. In the star clustering algorithm, an edge is added between two sessions in the graph of all sessions only if their similarity is above the threshold. Although less true for NetBIOS data, the similarity threshold does not significantly impact the quality of the resulting clustering. Clustering precision drops as the threshold nears 0 because the star graph becomes nearly fully connected, and the algorithm cannot select suitable cluster centers. Recall that no cluster centers can share an edge, so many different clusters merge together at low threshold values. At the clustering threshold used in our experiments (0.8), precision scores were perfect or nearly perfect.

### Signature Effectiveness

Intrusion detection signatures should satisfy two basic properties:
1. High detection rate: They should not miss real attacks.
2. Low false alarm rate: They should generate few false alarms.

Our results show that Nemean has a 99.9% detection rate with 0 false alarms. Two additional metrics evaluate the quality of the alarms raised by an IDS:
- **Precision:** Empirically evaluates alarms by their specificity to the attack producing the alarm.
- **Noise level:** Counts the number of alarms per incident and penalizes redundant alarms.

For comparison, we use Snort-2.1.0 with the HTTP pre-processor enabled and its complete associated ruleset. Snort is known for its susceptibility to false positives.

#### Detection Rate

- **Connection-level HTTP signatures:** Detected 100.0% of the attacks.
- **Session-level HTTP signatures:** Detected 97.7% of the attacks. Session-level signatures for Nimda were not evaluated due to the extreme variability of Nimda attacks.

### Highly Specific Alarms

Nemean generates alerts that are empirically better than those produced by packet-level systems like Snort. Typical Snort alerts, such as "Bare Byte Unicode Encoding" and "Non-RFC HTTP Delimiter," report the underlying symptom but not the high-level reason. Nemean, via connection-level or session-level signatures, provides a larger perspective of a host's intentions, generating alerts specific to particular worms or known exploits.

### Low Noise Due to Session-Level Signatures

Nemean reduces the number of alerts per incident by aggregating information into connections or sessions. For example, a Nimda attack containing an encoded URL will generate URL decoding alarms in Snort and alerts for WEB-IIS cmd.exe access. Nemean converts the URL to a canonical form to accurately detect Nimda attacks, reducing the number of alerts per incident.

### Signature Generation Efficiency

Nemean is efficient, capable of generating signatures for 2 days worth of NetBIOS data (almost 2 million packets) in under 70 seconds. Even the most expensive operation, session-level generalization of HTTP data, required less than 10 minutes of computation. Deploying Nemean as an online signature generator would require limited system resources and can easily operate at the speeds of incoming data.

### Honeycomb Comparison

Honeycomb was one of the first efforts to address automatic signature generation from honeypot traces. A comparison between Nemean and Honeycomb is provided in the technical report.
