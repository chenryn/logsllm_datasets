User: I'm working on a Python shell script that is supposed to fill a percentage of the user's screen. The shell's width, however, is calculated in characters instead of pixels, and I find it difficult to compare them to the screen resolution (which is obviously in pixels).
How can I effectively calculate the width in characters with only the screen pixels while still being able to support both Windows and Linux?
For the sake of the question, let's assume none of the users have changed their shell settings from the default ones.
Assistant: You cant but the default command prompt dimensions are 677, 343. The height being 677 and the width being 343, hope this helps.
