| Dataset          | Blur Filter | NLM Filter | BM3D Filter | Wavelet Denoising |
|------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| BigGAN-DogHV     | 74.1        | 82.6       | 95.0        | **99.6**          |
| CycleGAN-Zebra   | 58.4        | 4.3        | 6.7         | **7.9**           |

**Note:** Bold numbers highlight the best performance in each dataset.

### Experimental Setup
- **Test Sets:** The test sets contain 50, 80, 100, and 200 fake images, respectively, with each set also containing 200 real images from the respective dataset.
- **Reference Set:** A reference set of 2000 real images is used.
- **Tmerдe Calibration:**
  - For StyleGAN-Face1 and PGGAN-Face, Tmerдe remains the same as in the original results (Table 2), computed using the Tmerдe estimation strategy in Section 4.2.
  - For BigGAN-DogHV, CycleGAN-Zebra, and StyleGAN-Face1, Tmerдe is tuned following the recalibration strategy suggested in Section 5.2.
- **Performance Metric:** F1 score of detection performance averaged over 5 trials.

### Results and Analysis
- **Detection Performance:** The performance is moderately high but decreases as the number of fake images decreases. This drop is attributed to a decrease in fingerprint purity due to merging with noisy samples among the increasingly large proportion of real images.
- **Fingerprint Purity:** Prior work indicates that a reliable fingerprint requires at least 50 images [6]. When there are too few fake images (e.g., <50), the threat is limited.
- **Filter Comparison:** Wavelet denoising provides better detection performance for nearly all datasets, with F1 scores exceeding 90% for all datasets. The BM3D filter also shows good performance but fails to effectively eliminate content from some datasets.

### Impact of Residual Image Extraction Filter on Performance
- **Filters Used:**
  - Blur filter [27]
  - Non-Local-Means (NLM) filter [10]
  - BM3D filter [20]
  - Wavelet denoising filter
- **Simulation:** Given a test set of 500 real and 500 fake images, a clean model fingerprint is estimated using a random subset of 100 fake images from the test set. The fingerprint is 100% pure (estimated over only fake images).
- **Results:** Wavelet denoising filter exhibits the best performance, with F1 scores exceeding 90% for all datasets. The BM3D filter also shows good performance but fails to effectively eliminate content from some datasets.

### Generalization Performance Comparison with a Supervised Scheme
- **Supervised Detection Schemes:** These schemes exhibit high performance but lack generalization. For example, MesoNet [1] trained on 1000 real and 1000 fake images from StyleGAN-Face1 achieves a high F1 score of 94% on a test set of the same size from StyleGAN-Face1. However, the performance drops to 65% on a test set from PGGAN-Face, indicating a failure to generalize.
- **NoiseScope Robustness:** NoiseScope shows robust performance across datasets with multiple GAN sources and maintains high detection performance even with imbalanced proportions of fake images.

### Summary
- **Evaluation:** NoiseScope was evaluated against datasets with balanced and imbalanced proportions of fake images, showing stable behavior with generally high detection performances.
- **Performance Drops:** Rare drops in performance were attributed to low fingerprint purity caused by low values of merging threshold Tmerдe. Guidelines for calibrating a better Tmerдe based on cluster sizes were provided.
- **Robustness:** NoiseScope is robust against datasets with multiple GAN sources and performs moderately well even with few fake images.
- **Filter Impact:** The impact of three popular alternative residual filters on NoiseScope’s performance was showcased.
- **Supervised Detection Limitations:** The inability of supervised detection to generalize was highlighted.

### Analysis of Countermeasures
- **Adaptive Attacker:** We consider a powerful adaptive attacker with knowledge of NoiseScope’s detection pipeline. Countermeasures aim to disrupt fingerprint extraction and fake image detection capabilities.
- **Recovery Measures:** Adaptive recovery measures are proposed to make NoiseScope robust to challenging countermeasures.

#### Compressing Fake Images
- **JPEG Compression:** JPEG compression disrupts camera fingerprint patterns, diminishing the correlation between fingerprints and residuals [31].
- **Results:** Surprisingly, NoiseScope is resilient against compression attacks. For StyleGAN-Face2, performance increases from 90.14% to 98.33% after applying compression.
- **Resilience Factors:**
  - Model fingerprints are extracted from the test set itself, capturing any artifacts introduced by compression.
  - JPEG compression introduces grid-like artifacts, making the model fingerprint distinct from device fingerprints.

#### Denoising Using the Defender’s Denoising Filter
- **Attack Method:** The attacker modifies fake images by subtracting the residual obtained using the defender’s denoising filter (Wavelet denoiser).
- **Results:** NoiseScope performance suffers for the BigGAN-DogHV and CycleGAN-Zebra datasets. Texture patterns in the fingerprints appear softened, leading to performance drops.
- **Recovery:** Adversarial training of the fingerprint classification module improves detection performance for both BigGAN-DogHV and CycleGAN-Zebra.

#### Other Post-Processing Schemes
- **Gamma Correction:** Applied to fake images with gamma values randomly sampled from U [1.0, 2.0] [80]. Performance remains high for most datasets except StyleGAN-Face2, where F1 score drops to 62%.
- **Histogram Equalization:** Involves distributing the intensity range to improve image contrast. Performance remains high for all datasets except StyleGAN-Face2.
- **Blur:** Performs normalized box averaging on fake images with a specific kernel size. Performance drops for StyleGAN-Face2, CycleGAN-Zebra, and StyleGAN-Face2.
- **Adding Noise:** Adds i.i.d. Gaussian noise to fake images. Performance drops significantly for CycleGAN-Zebra and StyleGAN-Face2. Recovery is achieved by applying a denoising filter (Non-Local-Means) and adversarial training.

#### Fingerprint Spoofing
- **Attack Method:** Disguises fake images to be from a specific camera device. Evaluated using the StyleGAN-Face1 dataset.
- **Results:** Low average F1 score of 66.67%.
- **Recovery:** Using a different filter (normalizing box filter) regains performance to 94.56% F1.

#### Adapting the GAN Model
- **Attacker Strategy:** Modifying the GAN to bypass detection.
- **Challenges:**
  - Model fingerprints are tied to the fundamental building blocks of generative models (deconvolution layers).
  - Ensuring differentiability for the operations is non-trivial.
  - Efforts to spoof the fingerprint are similar to previous countermeasures and lead to significant image quality degradation.

This comprehensive analysis highlights the robustness of NoiseScope and the effectiveness of the proposed recovery measures against various countermeasures.
