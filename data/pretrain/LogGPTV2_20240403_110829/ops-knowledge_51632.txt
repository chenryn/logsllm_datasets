1. **Session Terminations:**
   - Multiple sessions are terminated, with specific session IDs noted:
     - `0x14ed93111f20005` at 19:52:16
     - `0x24ed93119420008` at 19:52:16

     - `0x14ed93111f2003f` at 21:41:34

2. **Socket Connections:**
   - The server accepts several socket connections from different IP addresses:
     - `/10.10.34.11:50822` at 19:52:20

     - `/10.10.34.21:51245` at 21:01:43

3. **Session Expirations:**
   - Several sessions expire due to exceeding the timeout period (10,000ms):
     - `0x14ed93111f20020` at 21:34:48
     - `0x24ed93119420033` at 21:36:24
     - `0x24ed9311942002a` at 21:36:26

4. **Connection Requests:**
   - A connection request from an old client is noted, which will be dropped if the server is in read-only mode:
     - `/10.10.34.13:37229` at 19:54:05
     - `/10.10.34.25:53326` at 21:01:50
