It appears there is an unexpected space at the end of the output in the following Julia code:

```julia
julia> @sprintf("%.6g", 1.0)
"1 "
```

This extra space seems to be a bug. 

To clarify, the expected output should be `"1"` without the trailing space. You may want to check if this issue has been reported or fixed in a more recent version of Julia, or consider reporting it to the Julia community.
