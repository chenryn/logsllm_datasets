User: Our application needs to perform natural language processing and sentiment analysis on users' posted information. How to use Python to achieve this function? Please provide code snippets and related dependent libraries.
Assistant: First, we need to install the relevant dependencies. Commonly used natural language processing libraries include NLTK and SpaCy, and sentiment analysis libraries can use TextBlob. The code snippet is as follows: ```python import nltk from textblob import TextBlob import spacy # Download the necessary NLTK data nltk.download('punkt') nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger') # Load the SpaCy model nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm ") # Define sentiment analysis function def sentiment_analysis(text): blob = TextBlob(text) return blob.sentiment.polarity # Define natural language processing function def text_analysis(text): doc = nlp(text) # Perform part-of-speech tagging pos_tags = [ (token.text, token.pos_) for token in doc] return pos_tags ```
