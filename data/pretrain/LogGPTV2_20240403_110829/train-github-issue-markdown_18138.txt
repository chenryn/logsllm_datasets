Just to play safe it is better to place `"use strict"` inside function to
avoid concat issues in future.
Original
    import {a} from './a.js';
Expected
    define(["exports", "./a.js"], function(exports, _a) {
      "use strict";
      var a = _a.a;
    });
Actual
    "use strict";
    define(["exports", "./a.js"], function(exports, _a) {
      var a = _a.a;
    });
The same is for UMD.
It is possible to fix it by placing `_moduleFormatter` transformer after
`useString`. But I am not sure that it is a good way.
