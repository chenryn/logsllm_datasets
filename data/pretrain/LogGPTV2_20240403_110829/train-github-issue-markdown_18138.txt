To ensure code safety and avoid potential concatenation issues in the future, it is recommended to place the `"use strict"` directive inside the function. Here's a more detailed and professional explanation:

### Original Code
```javascript
import {a} from './a.js';
```

### Expected Code
```javascript
define(["exports", "./a.js"], function(exports, _a) {
  "use strict";
  var a = _a.a;
});
```

### Actual Code
```javascript
"use strict";
define(["exports", "./a.js"], function(exports, _a) {
  var a = _a.a;
});
```

### Explanation
In the actual code, the `"use strict"` directive is placed outside the `define` function, which can lead to issues if the code is concatenated with other scripts that do not use strict mode. To prevent such issues, it is better to place the `"use strict"` directive inside the `define` function.

### UMD Considerations
The same principle applies to UMD (Universal Module Definition) code. The `"use strict"` directive should be placed inside the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to ensure that it only affects the enclosed scope.

### Potential Fix
One possible fix is to adjust the order of transformers, placing the `_moduleFormatter` transformer after the `useString` transformer. However, this approach may not be ideal and could introduce other complexities. A more straightforward and reliable solution is to manually ensure that the `"use strict"` directive is correctly placed within the function scope.

### Recommended Code
```javascript
define(["exports", "./a.js"], function(exports, _a) {
  "use strict";
  var a = _a.a;
});
```

By following this practice, you can ensure that your code remains robust and avoids potential issues related to strict mode and script concatenation.
