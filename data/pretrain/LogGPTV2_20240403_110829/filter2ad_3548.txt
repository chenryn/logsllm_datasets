In the classic IT realm, the CTO role was created to
assist CIOs to develop viable technical solutions to
existing problems. However, in the realm of the vendors
and suppliers, there is considerably less agreement on
what exactly the CTO needs to do, but no shortage of
opinions on what makes the role difficult to fill. This
panel addresses a number of challenges by some of the
most well respected security tool vendor CTOs.
The first panel topics center around the CTO role, and
how it changes as the company grows and matures.
Perhaps considerably more
so than in classic IT
organizations, vendor CTOs must be sensitive to the
business requirements of
the company and whether
certain technologies can provide a reasonable return on
investment.
But, how do CTOs straddle the roles of being the
technical purists that the outside world expects and the
realistic pragmatist that their business partners demand?
How do CTOs find a balance between business line
responsibilities and keeping various constituencies happy,
such as business partners, customers, prospective partners,
and the ever dynamic and fickle analyst community? And
if business doesn't prosper, how much responsibility (and
blame) does the CTO bear?
Another challenge for CTOs revolves around domain
expertise. Often CTOs are selected for the specific
knowledge of a technology area pertinent to a problem or
solution. What happens when the solution migrates out of
the CTOs domain expertise? How much responsibility
does a CTO have for ensuring that their company's core
competency doesn't inadvertently serve as an "immune
system" to resist alternative solutions? Or is the CTO
position merely a safe place to put technical founders?
Other topics that will be covered include: How does
one become a CTO, anyway? What do you think a CTO
really should do? What would you say to someone who
wants to be a CTO? What are the toughest lessons you
learned? Will there be CTOs ten years from now?
Each panelist was a co-founder and CTO of a security
tool vendor, and is guaranteed to have opinions on each of
these topics.
