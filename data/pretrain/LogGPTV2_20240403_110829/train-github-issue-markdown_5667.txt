#### Description
I suspect there is a bug in the `nct` (non-central t) distribution implementation in `scipy.stats`, as the `_argcheck` method appears to be improperly defined. This issue can be demonstrated with the following example:

```python
>>> import scipy.stats as stats
>>> stats.nct.cdf(-0.5, 10, -0.5)
nan
```

However, when using the internal `_cdf` method directly, the correct result is returned:

```python
>>> stats.nct._cdf(-0.5, 10, -0.5)
0.50490799249967822
```

This value matches the result obtained from R, which is `0.50490799249967822`.

#### Context
This functionality is essential for calculating the power of a t-test.
