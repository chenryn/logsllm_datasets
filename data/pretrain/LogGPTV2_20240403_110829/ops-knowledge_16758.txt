User: How to implement a simple load balancing solution that includes multiple application servers and clients.
Assistant: One solution to achieve load balancing is to use a reverse proxy server. The specific steps are as follows: 1. Build multiple application servers, and run the same application program on each application server. 2. Install a reverse proxy server such as Nginx or Apache HTTP Server. 3. Configure load balancing strategies on the reverse proxy server, such as round robin, IP hash, etc., so that requests are evenly distributed to different application servers. 4. The client sends a request to the reverse proxy server, and the reverse proxy server forwards the request to an application server and returns the response to the client. Different load balancing strategies can be selected according to actual needs, and the weight and load balancing algorithm can be adjusted according to the performance evaluation of the server. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider how to implement session persistence to avoid problems such as loss of user login status on different application servers.
