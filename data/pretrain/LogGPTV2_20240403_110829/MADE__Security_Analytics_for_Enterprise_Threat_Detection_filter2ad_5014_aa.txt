## Abstract
Enterprises are increasingly targeted by sophisticated malware activities. To counter these threats, most enterprises deploy a variety of security technologies, such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and web proxies, along with specialized teams of security analysts forming Security Operations Centers (SOCs). In this paper, we address the problem of detecting malicious activity in enterprise networks and prioritizing the detected activities based on their risk. We introduce a system called MADE, which uses machine learning to analyze data extracted from security logs. MADE leverages an extensive set of features for identifying enterprise malicious communication and employs supervised learning for prioritization rather than just detection. Over a one-month deployment in a large enterprise, MADE successfully prioritized the most risky domains contacted by enterprise hosts, achieving a precision of 97% in the top 100 detected domains, with a very low false positive rate. Additionally, MADE identified 18 new malicious activities that were overlooked by state-of-the-art security technologies.

## Introduction
Criminal activity on the Internet is expanding at an exponential rate, driven by new monetization capabilities and increased access to sophisticated malware toolkits. The gap between attackers and defenders continues to widen, as highlighted by the growing detection deficit (the difference between an attacker's time to compromise and a defender's time to detect) in the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) [3]. This issue is exacerbated by the ever-growing attack surface, including new platforms like mobile, cloud, and IoT, and the ease of social engineering.

Enterprises face significant challenges in protecting their perimeters, which are only as strong as their weakest link. With the prevalence of remote workers using company-issued computers on uncontrolled networks, traditional security measures such as firewalls, anti-virus agents, and web proxies are no longer sufficient. Large organizations often employ tier 3 analysts (part of the SOC) to manually search for malicious behavior that evades automated tools. However, this approach is not scalable due to the lack of qualified personnel and the rapid pace of malware invasions.

In this paper, we address the problem of detecting and prioritizing new malicious activities in enterprise networks for operational use in the SOC. We focus on malware command-and-control (C&C) communication, a fundamental component of most cyber attacks. We design a system called MADE (Malicious Activity Detection in Enterprises) that uses supervised learning techniques applied to a large set of features extracted from web proxy logs to proactively detect network connections resulting from malware communication. 

MADE overcomes several challenges, including handling large data volumes, addressing the lack of ground truth in unlabeled data, and ensuring high accuracy with low false positive rates. It also provides interpretability of its decisions, which is crucial for manual validation by SOC analysts. Our evaluation shows that over one month, MADE achieved 97% precision in the top 100 detected domains, with a false positive rate of 6 · 10−5.

## Background and Overview

### 2.1 Enterprise Perimeter Defenses
Enterprises deploy a range of network-level defenses, including firewalls, web proxies, and endpoint technologies, to protect against cyber threats. These security controls generate large amounts of security logs, typically stored in a centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. Despite these protections, large enterprises recognize the need for incident response teams, including security analysts, to augment their defense capabilities. These analysts use security logs for forensic investigations and to detect additional suspicious activities.

We collaborated with the SOC of a large, geographically-distributed enterprise to gain access to their security logs. The tier 3 security analysts in the SOC use advanced tools, but rely heavily on manual analysis and domain expertise to identify new malicious activities. Our goal is to design intelligent algorithms and tools for the SOC analysts that automatically detect and prioritize the most suspicious enterprise activities.

### 2.2 Problem Definition and Adversarial Model
Our objective is to use machine learning (ML) to proactively identify and prioritize external network communications related to malware C&C communication over HTTP or HTTPS, also known as beaconing [30]. As enterprise firewalls and proxies typically block incoming connections, outbound C&C channels are the primary means of communication between victims and attackers. C&C is used extensively in fully automated campaigns (e.g., botnets, ransomware) and in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaigns.

C&C increasingly relies on HTTP/HTTPS channels to maintain stealth by blending in with legitimate web traffic. Therefore, it is natural to leverage web proxy logs, which intercept all HTTP and HTTPS communication at the enterprise network border. Each log event includes fields such as connection timestamp, IP addresses, ports, full URL, HTTP method, bytes sent and received, status code, user-agent string, web referer, and content type.

We assume that remote attackers have compromised at least one machine within the enterprise network. Once compromised, the victim initiates HTTP or HTTPS communication with the remote attacker, which is logged by the web proxies and stored in the SIEM system. We assume that attackers have not gained full control of the SIEM system and cannot manipulate the stored security logs.

### 2.3 System Overview
The MADE system architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Training (Section 3):**
   - **Data Filtering and Labeling:** Connections unlikely to be C&C traffic (e.g., CDNs, adware, popular domains) are excluded, and malicious domains are labeled using threat intelligence services.
   - **Feature Extraction:** A large number of features (89) are extracted from the web proxy logs, complemented by external data sources such as WHOIS and ASN information.
   - **Feature Selection:** Features are ranked, and a subset with the highest information gain is selected.
   - **Model Selection:** Various metrics are analyzed for four classes of supervised learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM), and the best-performing model is chosen.

2. **Testing (Section 4):**
   - **Data Representation:** Selected features are extracted from new real-time data.
   - **Model Prediction:** Domain risk scores are output using the trained ML model.
   - **Ranking High-Risk Communications:** The most suspicious connections are prioritized according to the SOC budget (10 per business day or 50 per week).

3. **Evaluation (Section 4):**
   - **Evaluation, Analysis, and Feedback:** The list of most suspicious domains is manually investigated by tier 3 SOC analysts, and feedback is provided on MADE’s detections.

### 2.4 Comparison with Previous Work
MADE is designed to detect enterprise malware communication and is the result of close collaboration with the enterprise SOC. Several recent papers have also focused on detecting malicious communication in enterprise settings from web proxy log analysis. Table 1 compares MADE with previous systems, highlighting its unique features and performance.

## Conclusion
MADE is a robust system designed to detect and prioritize malicious activities in enterprise networks. By leveraging machine learning and a comprehensive set of features, MADE achieves high precision and low false positive rates, making it a valuable tool for SOC analysts. Our evaluation demonstrates that MADE can effectively identify both known and new malicious activities, providing a significant advantage in the ongoing battle against cyber threats.
