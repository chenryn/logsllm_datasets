I am using the Terminal 2.4 in Mac OS X 10.9, Julia Version 0.3.4-pre+47
I don't know how it happened, but I got a `\0` in my REPL, which got stored in
my `.julia_history` file. Whenever I try to up-arrow to the line and edit it,
the cursor marker doesn't move, but internally the cursor does seem to move
because I can insert characters in different positions.
I don't know how to type a `\0` character, but you can reproduce the behavior
by manually inserting a `0x00` byte into the beginning of some line in
`.julia_history`.
It's not a big deal, because I don't often inadvertently type that character,
but maybe it could be ignored or something.
