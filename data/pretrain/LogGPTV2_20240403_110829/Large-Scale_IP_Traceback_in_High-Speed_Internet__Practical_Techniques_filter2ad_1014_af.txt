(cid:12)gures, we assume s = 0:4 (devote 0.4 bits of compu-
tation to each packet). We set k to 12 bits and p to
3.3% (12 (cid:2) 3:3% = 0:4), which correspond to the opti-
mal parameter setting prescribed by the information-
theoretic framework in Section 4.3.2. The three curves
in each (cid:12)gure correspond to 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 at-
tackers, respectively.
For all curves in Figures 7(a,b,c), we observe that
as the number of attack packets used for traceback Np
increases, FNR value decreases sharply, which corre-
sponds to more and more infected routers being iden-
ti(cid:12)ed. On the other hand, the FPR value in Fig-
ures 8(a,b,c) increases very slowly and is always rea-
sonable. The increase of FPR is caused by our \one-
packet decoding rule". In general, the lower FNR we
get from larger Np signi(cid:12)cantly outweighs the slightly
higher FPR.
We also observe that our scheme can achieve very
high traceback accuracy with a reasonable number of
attack packets. For example in Figure 7(a), under the
attack from 1,000 attackers, about 175,000 attack pack-
ets would be enough to track more than 90% of the
infected routers, resulting in only 4.4% FPR. In this
case, the average number of packets per attacker is
175. As the number of attackers increases, the number
of packets to achieve the same accuracy also increases.
However, normalized over the number of attackers, this
number actually decreases. For example, to track 90%
of the infected routers when there are 2,000 or 5,000
attackers, we need 325,000 or 725,000 packets, respec-
tively. The normalized numbers in these two cases are
160 and 145, respectively. The reason is that, the more
attackers there are, the easier it is to identify the in-
fected routers located not too far from the victim.
6. Related Work
[27]) or statistics-based (e.g.,
Recent large-scale DDoS attacks have drawn consid-
erable attention [13]. The broad research e(cid:11)orts on de-
fending DDoS attacks can be classi(cid:12)ed into three cat-
egories.
1. Attack detection and classi(cid:12)cation. Many tech-
niques have been proposed to detect ongoing DDoS
attacks, which can be classi(cid:12)ed into either signature-
based (e.g.,
[33]). As
we have mentioned, these attack detection techniques
are needed to trigger our traceback procedure. Hus-
sain et al. [15] propose a framework to classify DoS at-
tacks into single source or multiple sources. This clas-
si(cid:12)cation information can help the victim to better re-
spond to the attacks.
2. Attack response mechanisms. Two classes of so-
lutions have been proposed to address the problem.
One class is the IP traceback schemes [4, 9, 28, 30,
8, 29, 14, 2] that we have discussed in detail in Sec-
tion 1, including this work. In addition to proposing
some PPM-based IP traceback schemes, Adler [2] stud-
ied the fundamental tradeo(cid:11)s between the number of
packets needed for traceback and the bits available for
performing packet marking, in the PPM context. In
this paper, we studied a similar tradeo(cid:11) question in
the context of logging-based IP traceback (i.e., hash-
based) and sampling. The techniques used in [2] to de-
rive these two tradeo(cid:11)s are very di(cid:11)erent. While tech-
niques in [2] come mostly from theoretical computer
science, ours come mostly from information theory. Fi-
nally, we (cid:12)nd it extremely hard to study this tradeo(cid:11)
question when the network allows both PPM and log-
ging, since the question can be cast as a network infor-
mation theory (mostly unsolved [7]) problem.
The second class is the techniques to prevent DDoS
attacks and/or to mitigate the e(cid:11)ect of such attacks
while they are raging on [19, 17, 36, 34, 31, 35, 12, 25,
18, 21, 24, 22]. In one of our prior work [31], we present
a technique that can e(cid:11)ectively (cid:12)lter out the majority
of DDoS tra(cid:14)c, thus improving the overall throughput
of the legitimate tra(cid:14)c. Another prior work of ours [34]
proposes a practical DDoS defense system that can pro-
tect the availability of web services during severe DDoS
attacks. These two pieces of work fall into the second
class. SOS [18] uses overlay techniques with selective
re-routing to prevent large (cid:13)ooding attacks. Mitigation
mechanisms proactively (cid:12)lter attack packets at strate-
gic places in the network. For example, Ferguson [12]
proposes to deploy ingress (cid:12)ltering in routers to de-
tect and drop packets sent using spoofed IP addresses
which do not belong to the stub network. Park et al. [25]
propose to install packet (cid:12)lters at the borders of au-
tonomous systems to (cid:12)lter packets traveling between
them. Yarr et al. [35] propose to encode the paths tra-
versed by the packets and (cid:12)lter out the attack tra(cid:14)c ac-
cording to the path identi(cid:12)er. Jin et al. [16] propose to
use the TTL values to detect and (cid:12)lter out spoofed IP
packets. Schemes in both [19] and [36] use router throt-
tles to allocate the victim bandwidth equally ([19]) or
in a min-max fashion ([36]) among perimeter routers.
All these schemes aim at (cid:12)ltering out attack tra(cid:14)c or
throttling its volume, thereby making legitimate traf-
(cid:12)c easier to go through.
3. Understanding DoS attack prevalence and at-
tack dynamics. Moore et al. used \backscatter anal-
ysis" to gauge the level of Internet DoS activity [23].
They studied the intensity and duration of the DoS at-
tacks and observed a small number of long attacks con-
stituting a signi(cid:12)cant fraction of the overall attack vol-
ume. Paxson [26] analyzed the re(cid:13)ector attacks that
conventional PPM schemes can not work against. He
then proposed a solution called Re(cid:13)ective Probabilis-
tic Packet Marking Scheme (RPPM).
7. Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented a new approach
to IP traceback based on logging sampled packet di-
gests. In this approach, the sampling rate can be low
enough for the scheme to scale to very high link speed
(e.g., OC-768). To achieve high traceback accuracy de-
spite the low sampling rate, we introduce ORMS, a
novel sampling technique. It signi(cid:12)cantly increases the
correlation between the packets sampled by neighbor-
ing routers, thereby enabling our traceback scheme to
achieve very high traceback accuracy and e(cid:14)ciency.
ORMS is also shown to be resistant to the tamper-
ing by the attackers. We analyze the proposed scheme
based on a novel information-theoretic framework. This
framework allows us to compute the parameters with
which our system achieves the optimal performance. It
also allows us to answer important questions concern-
ing the trade-o(cid:11) between the amount of evidence the
victim uses for traceback (the number of attack pack-
ets) and the traceback accuracy. Our simulation results
show that the proposed scheme performs very well with
a reasonable number of attack packets as \evidence",
even when there are thousands of attackers and the
sampling rate is as low as 3.3%.

Appendix
A. Computing H(ZjXt1 + Xf1; Yt + Yf )
The number of attack packets Xt1 sampled by router
R1 is a binomial random variable with probability
mass function Pr[Xt1 = k] = (cid:0)Npd1
The number of false positives Xf1 when Lv is queried
against the Bloom (cid:12)lter at router R1 is also a bino-
mial random variable, with the following probability
mass function:
k (cid:1)pk(1 (cid:0) p)Npd1(cid:0)k.
Npd1
Pr[Xf1 = k] =
Pr[Xt1 = i](cid:16)Np (cid:0) i
k (cid:17)f k(1 (cid:0) f )Np(cid:0)i(cid:0)k:
Let X = Xt1 + Xf1 and Y = Yt + Yf . The probability
mass function of X is given as follows:
Xi=0
Now all we need is to compute Pr[Yt = kjX =
j; Z = 1]. Its computation is a little involved. We
will show how to compute it step by step. The ran-
dom variable X (i.e., Xt1 + Xf1) and Yt satis(cid:12)es
Xt1 = Yt + W1 + W2 where, W1 and W2 have prob-
ability distributions Binom(Npd2 (cid:0) Xt2 ; p=(2 (cid:0) p)) and
(Npd1 (cid:0) Npd2; p) respectively. Intuitively, the attack
packets sampled by R1 consist of three parts: (1) Yt,
number of attack packets that R2 has sampled; (2)
W1, number of attack packets sampled from the set
of attack packets that are not sampled by R2; (3)
W2, number of attack packets sampled from attack
packets coming from neighbors other than R2. We as-
sume d1 = d2 as explained in Section 4.3.1. Since
l=0 Pr[Xf1 = ljZ =
1]Pr[Yt = kjXt1 = j (cid:0) l; Xf1 = l; Z = 1], all we need to
calculate is Pr[Yt = kjXt1 = j (cid:0) l; Xf1 = l; Z = 1]. It is
given as follows:
Pr[Yt = kjX = j; Z = 1] = Pj
Pr[Yt = kjXt1 = j (cid:0) l; Xf1 = l; Z = 1]
Npd2
Pr[Xt2 = gjZ = 1] (cid:1)
Xg=k
Pr[Yt = k; W1 = j (cid:0) l (cid:0) kjXt1 = j (cid:0) l; Xf1 = l; Xt2 = g; Z = 1]
Npd2
Pr[Xt2 = gjZ = 1] (cid:1)
Xg=k
=

Pr[Yt = kjXt2 = g; Z = 1]Pr[W1 = j (cid:0) l (cid:0) kjXt2 = g; Z = 1]
Npd2

Once we have computed Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 1],
then according to formula (2) in Section 4.2 the condi-
tional entropy can be calculated as follows:

H(ZjX; Y )
Pr[X = k] =
min (k;Npd1)
Xi=0
Pr[Xt1 = i]Pr[Xf1 = k (cid:0) i]:
The probability mass function of the pair of random
variables (X; Y ) conditioned on Z = 1 is given as fol-
lows:
= (cid:0) X(X;Y )
(cid:0) X(X;Y )
where
Pr[X = i; Y = j; Z = 1] log2
Pr[X = i; Y = j; Z = 0] log2
Pr[X = i; Y = j; Z = 1]
Pr[X = i; Y = j]
Pr[X = i; Y = j; Z = 0]
Pr[X = i; Y = j]
Pr[X = j; Y = ijZ = 1]
= Pr[X = jjZ = 1]Pr[Y = ijX = j; Z = 1]
Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 0] = Pr[X = ijZ = 0]Pr[Y = jjX = i; Z = 0]
= Pr[X = i](cid:16)i
j(cid:17)f j (1 (cid:0) f )i(cid:0)j
The probability mass function of Pr[Y = ijX =
and
j; Z = 1] is given as follows:
Pr[Yt+Yf = ijX = j; Z = 1] =
min(i;Npd2)
Xk=0
Pr[Yt = kjX = j; Z = 1](cid:1)
Pr[Yf = i (cid:0) kjX = j; Yt = k; Z = 1]
Pr[X = i; Y = j] = Pr[Z = 0]Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 0]
+Pr[Z = 1]Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 1]
= Pr[Xt2 = 0]Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 0]
+Pr[Xt2 > 0]Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = 1]:
where Pr[Yf = i (cid:0) kjX = j; Yt = k; Z = 1] =
(cid:0)j(cid:0)k
i(cid:0)k(cid:1)f i(cid:0)k(1 (cid:0) f )j(cid:0)i.
Finally, note that Pr[X = i; Y = j; Z = a] =
Pr[X = i; Y = jjZ = a]Pr[Z = a] for a = 0; 1, and
Pr[Z = 0] = Pr[Z = 1] = 1=2 as assumed in Sec. 4.3.1.
