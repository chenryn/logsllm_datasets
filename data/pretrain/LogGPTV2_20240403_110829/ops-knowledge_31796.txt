Access control: set access permissions for sensitive data, and only specific personnel can access it. 4. Data backup: Make data backup to ensure that the data can be restored when it is lost or deleted. 5. Security audit: Conduct regular security audits to check who has accessed sensitive data, whether it has been leaked, etc. Prevention of hacker attacks: 1. Firewall: Install a firewall to filter traffic and prevent data intrusion from unknown sources. 2. Security authentication: Use security authentication measures such as strong password policy, multi-layer authentication and single sign-on to ensure that only authorized users can access the system. 3. Vulnerability management: Regularly scan system vulnerabilities, repair and update patches for discovered vulnerabilities. 4. Security training: Provide security training to employees to improve their security awareness and reduce misoperation and social engineering attacks. 5. Log management: establish a complete log management system to record system operations and events, and facilitate tracking and analysis of security events.
