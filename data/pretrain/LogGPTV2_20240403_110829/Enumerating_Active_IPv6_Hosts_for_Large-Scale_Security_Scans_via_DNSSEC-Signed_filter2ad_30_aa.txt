### Abstract:
This paper presents a method for enumerating active IPv6 hosts in large-scale security scans by leveraging DNSSEC-signed reverse zones. The approach is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of network scanning, particularly in environments with a high density of IPv6 addresses.

### Introduction:
The increasing adoption of IPv6 has introduced new challenges for network security, particularly in the context of large-scale scans. Traditional methods of host discovery, such as ICMP echo requests, are often ineffective due to the vast address space and the lack of responses from many devices. This paper proposes a novel technique that utilizes DNSSEC-signed reverse zones to identify active IPv6 hosts.

### Methodology:
1. **DNSSEC-Signed Reverse Zones**: We leverage DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to ensure the authenticity of the DNS records. By querying these signed zones, we can reliably map IP addresses to their corresponding domain names.
2. **Active Host Detection**: Once the DNS records are obtained, we filter out inactive or non-responsive hosts by cross-referencing the results with other data sources, such as active scan results and known good lists.
3. **Scalability and Performance**: The method is designed to be scalable, allowing it to handle large networks efficiently. We use parallel processing and optimized query techniques to minimize the time required for enumeration.

### Results:
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy and speed of host enumeration compared to traditional methods. In a test environment, we were able to identify over 90% of active hosts with a false positive rate of less than 5%.

### Conclusion:
The use of DNSSEC-signed reverse zones for enumerating active IPv6 hosts in large-scale security scans is a promising approach. It provides a reliable and efficient way to discover active devices, which is crucial for effective network security. Future work will focus on further optimizing the method and integrating it into existing security tools.
