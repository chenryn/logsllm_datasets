5.79𝑢𝑠 and is independent of the 𝜖 setting. This cost is mainly
due to the invocation of the random number generation func-
tion, get_random_bytes(). Note that this overhead is incurred
in the scheduler when a job arrives, which is not equivalent to
the context switch overhead as an arrival of a job in EDF (and 𝜖-
Scheduler) does not necessarily lead to a new scheduling event (i.e.,
a pick_next_dl_entity() call).
We also measured the power consumption of the platform for
each of the schedulers. When the scaling governor is configured
as scaling_governor = performance ( a typical setting for RTS
to maintain a predictable execution time and behavior), the power
consumption consistent for all schedulers. It is expected as the CPU
runs at the highest frequency at all times under the performance
setting. For a comparison purposes, we measure the power con-
sumption with scaling_governor = ondemand that lowers the CPU
frequency (i.e., less power consumption) when idling for a signifi-
cant amount of time. The resulting power consumption matches
what we have learned from the above experiments (e.g., lower con-
text switch ratio in 𝜖-Scheduler) and suggest that 𝜖-Scheduler does
not result in higher power consumption.
9 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
From the evaluation, both 𝜖 = 103 and 𝜖 = 10 settings produce
promising results for obscuring the periodicity and diversifying the
schedule. However, as shown by the QoS measurements, the 𝜖 = 103
setting yields more reasonable variations in the task frequencies.
While 𝜖-Scheduler offers less protection with 𝜖 = 103 value, it may
not be unusual to choose such a large 𝜖 value in many RTS. The
same outcomes can be drawn from the evaluation using the two
real applications in which the system reaches a balance between
performance and security with 𝜖 = 103. On the other hand, with
𝜖 = 10, the results demonstrate how diverse the performance impact
could be for different applications. In such a setting, the rover
system performs with an acceptable error, while the video streaming
service becomes unusable. Considering that every application has
its unique tolerance to variations, the 𝜖 value should be determined
on a case-by-case basis in conjunction with system designers.
A possible improvement is to dynamically adjust the 𝜖 value
based on the QoS and protection demand at run-time. In such a
case, 𝜖 is particularly useful as a security parameter to be integrated
with a feedback control real-time scheduling algorithm (e.g., [43]).
