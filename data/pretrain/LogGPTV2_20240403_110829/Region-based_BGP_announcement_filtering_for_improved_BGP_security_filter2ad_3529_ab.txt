RBF can be eﬀectively supported in the future Internet,
which incorporates RBF-like schemes as a ﬁrst-order de-
sign principle. We then consider the practical deploy-
ment of RBF in the current Internet.
3.1 RBF Overview
RBF can be deployed independently by individual
ASes. An RBF-enabled AS will maintain the corre-
sponding region-level Internet numbers allocation infor-
mation. In this paper, we consider two levels of regions:
the country-level and RIR-level.
In the country-level
RBF, an AS needs to maintain the country-level alloca-
tion information of all active ASNs and IP address pre-
ﬁxes, i.e., to which country an ASN (and IP address pre-
ﬁx) is allocated. Similarly, an AS needs to maintain the
RIR-level allocation information of Internet numbers if
it supports RIR-level RBF. An AS decides to support
country or RIR-level RBF based on its own security re-
quirements. A country-level RBF provides higher secu-
rity guarantees than an RIR-level RBF. This allocation
information can be maintained at a central server in the
AS so that the border BGP routers can query. For bet-
ter performance, all border BGP routers can also store
a local cache of this allocation information.
When a BGP router receives a BGP announcement
r, it will extract the origin AS v and the corresponding
destination preﬁx p from the route r. The router will
then look up the region information of v and p. If both
belong to the same region, the route is accepted by the
router for further normal BGP processing. If the origin
AS and preﬁx do not belong to the same region, the
router has identiﬁed a mismatch and the correspond-
ing BGP announcement is ﬂagged as a potential preﬁx
hijacking attack. A ﬂagged route is either dropped or
passed to network operators for further analysis using
techniques such as [10]. After RBF has been widely
deployed on the Internet, we recommend the policy of
dropping ﬂagged routes for stronger security and better
incentives for others to follow the operational practice
consistent with RBF.
RBF is a light-weight preﬁx hijacking prevention and
deterrence technique. From the above discussion, we
can see that a BGP router only needs to maintain a
small amount of Internet numbers allocation informa-
tion (see Section 4 on the current counts of ASNs and
IANAAfriNICAPNICARINLACNICRIPECNNICAT&T91IP address blocks). The region lookup overhead should
also be negligible using techniques such as hash tables
(see the next subsection on the details of practical re-
gion lookup). In addition, RBF provides strong incen-
tives for individual ASes to independently deploy the
scheme. Even if only a single AS v deploys the scheme,
it still guarantees that v’s own traﬃc to a destination
preﬁx will be sent to the correct destination (if the AS
has a valid route to the destination).
So far, we have focused on the deployment of RBFs by
individual ASes. RBFs can also be deployed at diﬀer-
ent scopes in a coordinated manner. For example, the
United States (US) may require all its ISPs connect-
ing to the external world (outside the US) to deploy
RBFs. In particular, all such RBFs will ﬁlter out BGP
announcements received from external world but involv-
ing network preﬁxes belonging to the US. In this way,
US can at least guarantee that intra-US traﬃc will not
be hijacked to a third-party country.
3.2 RBF Practical Deployment
In this section we discuss the practical issues we face
in deploying RBF on the current Internet, in particular,
how Internet numbers allocation information is obtained
and maintained, the handling of sub-preﬁx announce-
ments and preﬁx aggregation, and how to reduce the
region lookup overhead of RBF.
3.2.1 Internet Numbers Allocation Information
As discussed in Section 2, each RIR updates and pub-
lishes its Internet numbers allocation information each
day, and all the RIRs mirror each other’s allocation in-
formation. An RBF-enabled AS can retrieve the num-
bers allocation information from the corresponding RIR
it belongs to. However, an AS cannot obtain the real-
time feed of the allocation information given that the
allocation ﬁles are updated only daily. Therefore, it
cannot access the allocation records made in the current
day, and it has to rely on up to yesterday’s allocation
records to process today’s BGP route announcements.
In practice, this is not a problem. Given that it takes
certain time for a network to obtain the ASN and IP
address block, it is reasonable to assume that the RIR
can add the corresponding allocation information into
the numbers allocation ﬁle at least one day before the
network is brought up online to the Internet.
In this
way, all the deployed RBFs on the Internet will have
the correct allocation information of the new network
(or rather the new ASN and IP address block).
3.2.2 Region Lookup of Preﬁxes
An RIR numbers allocation ﬁle frequently contains
IP address blocks that cannot be represented by a sin-
gle preﬁx.
In addition, it is also common for an AS
to announce a sub-preﬁx (smaller IP address range) in-
stead of the original preﬁx allocated to the AS. Both
contribute to the complexity of region lookup in RBF;
simple hash tables may not be directly used.
In the
following we discuss a simple region lookup algorithm
using a mechanism based on binary search. Other ap-
proaches are also possible.
We ﬁrst note that the IP address blocks in the alloca-
tion ﬁles are non-overlapping (due to the fact that they
are allocated to diﬀerent organizations). Using this, we
can sort all the allocation blocks by mapping the ﬁrst al-
located address in a block into a 32-bit integer. When a
BGP announcement is received, the RBF-enabled router
will extract the ﬁrst IP address p1 and the last IP ad-
dress pn from the announced preﬁx p, and convert them
into 32-bit integers as well. The router then can ﬁnd in
the allocation set the largest integer n such that n ≤ p1,
and verify that both p1 and pn belong to the corre-
sponding block. Otherwise, the announced preﬁx will
be ﬂagged.
BGP routers may aggregate preﬁxes learned from down-
stream ASes into a single less speciﬁc preﬁx. In some
cases, an as set may be added into the as path attribute
due to preﬁx aggregation. as set is an unordered list of
ASNs, from which it is unclear which is the originating
AS of a preﬁx. When an as path contains an as set, we
will remove the as set from the path attribute in deter-
mining the origin AS of the (aggregated) preﬁx. That
is, we consider the ﬁrst AS following as set as the ori-
gin AS of the corresponding preﬁx. Given that preﬁx
aggregation normally occurs for ASes with certain rela-
tionship, the involved ASes are likely within the same
region. As a consequence, we believe that preﬁx aggre-
gation will not have any major impacts on the perfor-
mance of RBF when we follow the above approach to
identify the origin AS of an (aggregated) preﬁx. We ver-
ify this observation in the next section when we study
the performance of RBF.
3.2.3 Caching Legitimate ASN/Preﬁx Pairs
A BGP router may receive a large number of BGP an-
nouncements each day. It can be a prohibitive overhead
for a router to look up the regions of the preﬁx and the
corresponding originating AS for every BGP announce-
ment it receives.
In order to reduce the overhead of
region lookup of RBF, a BGP router can maintain a
cache table of the legitimate pairs of ASN and preﬁx.
That is, after a router veriﬁes that a pair of ASN and
preﬁx observed in a BGP announcement belong to the
same region, the router can add this pair into the cache
table. After a BGP announcement is received by the
router, it will ﬁrst check if the pair of the preﬁx and
the originating AS is in the cache table. The more ex-
pensive region lookup of the preﬁx and the ASN is only
performed if the pair cannot be found in the cache ta-
ble. Given that the majority of the association between
preﬁxes and ASNs are stable (see the next section), we
only need to look up the region for a small number of
preﬁx/ASN pairs. This can greatly reduce the overhead
of RBF.
4. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section we evaluate the performance of RBF
using real Internet numbers allocation information and
the BGP data trace collected by the University of Ore-
gon Route Views project [21]. We will ﬁrst examine
the dynamics of the Internet numbers allocation infor-
mation. We will then study the behavior of RBF un-
der normal Internet operational conditions for which no

BGP preﬁx hijacking events were reported. At the end
we will investigate the eﬀectiveness of RBF on handling
both large-scale and small-scale BGP preﬁx hijacking
attacks. We summarize our main ﬁndings in the follow-
ing.
• The Internet numbers allocation information is rel-
atively stable. On average only a small number
of (13) new ASNs and (19) IP address blocks are
added daily on the Internet.
• About 8% (3%) of BGP announcements will be
ﬂagged by the country-level (RIR-level) RBF each
day in normal Internet operations where no known
hijacking events were publicly reported. The ma-
jority (98%) of ﬂagged preﬁxes are announced from
stub networks (i.e., edge of the Internet).
• Augmenting RBF with the information of legacy
preﬁx announcement arrangement will dramati-
cally reduce the number of ﬂagged BGP announce-
ments. On average only 215 BGP announcements
will be ﬂagged on a daily basis in the normal Inter-
net operation. The ﬂagged BGP announcements
are relatively stable.
• Applying RBF to the well-documented AS9121
and YouTube incidents shows that RBF is very
eﬀective in detecting both large-scale and small-
scale BGP preﬁx hijacking attacks.
4.1 Dynamics of Internet Numbers Alloca-
tion
In order to understand the dynamics of Internet num-
bers allocation information, we downloaded and exam-
ined allocation ﬁles from the ﬁve RIRs for six months
and one week, from 01/01/2008 to 07/07/2008 (we use
the week in July 2008 to study the behavior of RBF
under normal conditions). Figure 2 shows the daily
number of ASNs and IP address blocks during this pe-
riod. On average, there are totally about 40 K ASNs
and 82 K IP address blocks each day, combining all the
ﬁve numbers allocation ﬁles. Importantly, the growth
of the total ASNs and IP address blocks is stable and
slow. On average, there are totally 13 new ASNs and
19 IP address blocks added each day. Among the ﬁve
RIRs, ARIN and RIPE NCC allocate the most ASNs
and IP address blocks (APNIC also contains a large
number of IP address blocks, but relatively small num-
ber of ASNs). As an example, Figure 3 shows the daily
number of ASNs and IP address blocks maintained by
ARIN.
In order to provide a better view of the dynamics of
the Internet numbers allocation, Figures 4 and 5 show
the number of added ASNs and IP address blocks from
ARIN, respectively. On average 6 ASNs and 4 IP ad-
dress blocks were added daily over the studied period.
We do not observe any deleted ASNs and IP address
blocks in the period. Internet numbers allocation from
other RIRs shows the similar trend (except that more
ASNs were added than IP address blocks at other RIRs).
From these ﬁgures we can see that the numbers of ASNs
and IP address blocks are very stable, which indicates
that relying on up-to yesterday’s allocation information
to ﬁlter the current BGP announcements will only in-

cur a small error rate compared to using the real-time
allocation information. In the following we will use the
numbers allocation ﬁles in this manner when we study
the RBF performance. Technically, we do have the al-
location ﬁle for the current day since we are analyzing
historical data. However, in order to study how RBF
performs on today’s Internet, we still use the yester-
day’s allocation ﬁle. Note that as we have discussed in
the last section, when RBF is widely deployed on the
Internet, RIRs should be able to publish the new allo-
cation information at least one day ahead of the network
being brought up online to avoid such errors.
4.2 RBF in Normal Internet Operation
In this section we study the behavior of RBF un-
der normal Internet conditions where no preﬁx hijack-
ing attacks were publicly reported.
In order to de-
tect BGP announcements with mismatched ASN and
IP preﬁx allocation information, we download the BGP
update messages from the Route Views project from
07/01/2008 to 07/07/2008. We use the previous day
numbers allocation ﬁles from the ﬁve RIRs as the allo-
cation information of ASNs and IP address preﬁxes for
the current day. For example, in order to check if a BGP
announcement is valid on 07/01/2008, we use the num-
bers allocation ﬁles updated at midnight 06/30/2008.
As shown in the above subsection, this should only intro-
duce a small error in the allocation mismatch detection.
For each day, we pre-process the BGP announcements
to remove duplicate BGP announcements.
4.2.1 RBF in Normal Internet Operation
Figures 6 and 7 show the daily number and percentage
of ﬂagged BGP announcements, respectively, for both
country-level and RIR-level RBF. On average, there are
about 250 K unique BGP announcements daily, of which,
19 K or 8% are ﬂagged by the country-level RBF, i.e.,
the corresponding origin AS and IP preﬁx are in dif-
ferent countries. Among the announced BGP updates,
7 K or 3% are ﬂagged by the RIR-level RBF.
From the above results we see that although the In-
ternet numbers allocation information is updated daily
by the RIRs, there are still a relatively high number of
ﬂagged BGP announcements. This is likely caused by
two reasons. First, the allocation ﬁles may still con-
