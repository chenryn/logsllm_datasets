### Focus Group Protocol: IPV Professionals

**Part 1: Introduction**

Thank you all for taking the time to talk to us. We are researchers from [institutions]. [Company] provides cybersecurity software and services such as [products]. [Company] offers customer support hotlines and online chats to help their customers with tech-related issues. Sometimes, callers may be in dangerous situations, such as stalking and domestic violence. [Company] aims to better assist these callers and understand the appropriate scope for their customer support in such cases.

Today’s meeting will be primarily discussion-based, with a few activities. There are no right or wrong answers; we are interested in your opinions based on your experiences and perspectives. You can choose not to comment and can leave the session at any point.

We would also like to get your consent to audio record the workshop session as a backup of our notes. These recordings will be transcribed, and all identifying information will be removed. The original recordings will be destroyed once the transcription is complete. Are you okay with us recording the meeting? Do you have any other questions before we get started?

- **Let’s go around the room with brief introductions.** Please tell us your name, job title, and how many years you have been in this role.
- **Have you ever worked directly with clients?** Have you encountered clients who have experienced intimate partner violence (IPV)?
- **Have you encountered clients who have experienced tech-related abuse?** Can you give an example?

**Part 2: Presenting and Discussing Customer Support Scenarios**

Now, we’d like to present a few example customer support transcripts and get your expert opinions on these interactions. These transcripts are based on real chats but have been shortened and anonymized. We’ll let you read each scenario and ask a few follow-up questions.

- **IPV professionals’ advice to this customer:** Ignoring the technical aspect of this problem, imagine someone were to come to you with this issue:
  - Are these problems similar to or different from the cases you normally receive at your organization? In what ways?
  - What advice would you give based on the available information?

- **IPV professionals’ advice to the support agent:**
  - In your opinion, what could the customer support agent offer this customer beyond assistance with [product name]?
  - Are there additional questions that customer support should be asking?
  - Are there resources customer support could share?
  - Should customer support point to other organizations, such as shelters or the police? Why or why not? How might it be done?
  - Should customer support provide specific advice about safety planning? Why or why not? How might it be done?

**Factors that might complicate advice:**
- What if the agent thinks the attacker is recording/listening to the chat?
- What if the customer is not alone when the call takes place?
- What if the attacker could be calling to access a victim’s account?

**Part 3: General Advice Going Beyond the Scenarios**

Now that we’ve looked at some examples of the problems that customer support faces, let’s think about the broader role that customer support can play in providing support to victims of abuse.

- Under what circumstances, if any, do you think that customer support’s duty to help extends beyond addressing product-specific issues identified by the customer?
- In your opinion, should customer support try to identify situations in which the caller may need additional safety planning advice? Why or why not? What can customer support do to identify such situations?
- Should customer support watch out for cues suggesting further questions are unsafe (e.g., due to being monitored)? Why or why not?
- How should customer support respond if a customer reveals personal, sensitive information about an assault or suicide?
- What training or education do you think the support rep could have to help them avoid adverse outcomes? For example, about IPV and risks related to leaving an abuser? About resources to share?

### Focus Group Protocol: Support Agents

**Introduction**

We are conducting a research study on technology and intimate partner abuse. We are exploring how security companies can help IPV survivors through their customer support. So far, we have conducted five focus groups with about 20 experts, such as social workers and legal advocates, to collect their feedback on this topic. Now, we want to talk to you as customer support practitioners and security experts to understand how effective, efficient, and practical some of these ideas are. After today's discussion, we plan to develop recommendations from these insights and integrate them into guidelines and training materials for customer support agents. We are happy to share these with you.

**Part 1: Study Background**

We conducted five focus groups with professionals to seek advice on how security companies can support IPV survivors. We presented three scenarios based on real chat transcripts from [Company] and asked participants how customer support could improve. The ideas we elicited from IPV professionals are not final. Participants sometimes disagreed with each other and mentioned the challenges and constraints of some of the ideas.

We’d like to ask some open questions about your organization:

- **How is your customer support team organized?**
- **What are the evaluation metrics for success for customer support agents?**

We’d now like to ask about your experiences with IPV at your company:

- **Have you or your employees encountered similar cases that involve IPV/technology abuse?**
- **What are your company’s current efforts for supporting IPV survivors that you’re aware of?**

We will present our findings in four parts. During our presentation, please feel free to chime in whenever you have any questions or comments. At the end of each part, we’ll have a short summary and discussion to ask you specific questions about what we shared and get your feedback. We expect each session to take about 12 minutes, and we’ll leave a few minutes at the end of today’s meeting to wrap up and discuss next steps.

**Part 2: Interacting with Customers**

Suggestions from IPV professionals:
- Explain why a product would be helpful
- Avoid overpromising
- Ask more probing questions

- **What are your reactions to these suggestions?** Comments or feedback?
- **Do you think it is feasible?**
- **How much of this would you say is your team already doing?**
- **Would this create conflict with your evaluation metrics of support agents, such as the rate of “resolving issues?”** If yes, is there any way to mitigate such conflict?
- **Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?**
- **Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?**

**Part 3: Advice Given to Customers**

What role do you think customer support should play in providing technical assistance vs. going beyond?

Suggestions from IPV professionals:
- Discuss potential consequences of given advice
- Provide resources for best security and safety practices

- **What are your reactions to these suggestions?** Comments or feedback?
- **Have your employees already been discussing consequences of advice?** If yes, could you give us an example?
- **Are there downsides of discussing potential consequences of advice?**
- **What resources do your support agents refer customers to about security and safety practices?** How often do they do this?
- **Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?**
- **Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?**

**Part 4: Making Referrals**

Suggestions from IPV professionals:
- Refer customers to a specialized team within the company
- Make external referrals based on trigger words

- **What are your reactions to these suggestions?** Comments or feedback?
- **Do you already have a multi-tiered support system?** What types of cases get transferred or escalated?
- **How feasible do you think it is to have a specialized team within your company to deal with IPV/tech abuse?**
- **Do your support reps already refer customers to resources outside of the company?** If yes, for what types of problems?
- **From your experience, how difficult would it be to identify these cases?** What are the challenges?
- **Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?**
- **Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?**

**Part 5: Training Materials**

Suggestions from IPV professionals:
- Have agents be familiar with common tech abuse cases
- Train agents for trauma-informed responses
- Ensure the well-being of support agents

- **What are your reactions to these suggestions?** Comments or feedback?
- **Have you embedded training for empathetic or trauma-informed responses in your current training materials/scripts?**
- **Are you already doing anything to prepare agents to handle difficult/traumatic customer issues?**
- **What have you done to ensure the well-being of your employees?** Could anything be done better?
- **Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?**
- **Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?**

**Closing**

We want to use the insights from our work with IPV experts and customer support teams, like you, to develop guidelines and training materials for integrating IPV support into customer support. If you’re interested, we will share materials with you when we have drafted them.
