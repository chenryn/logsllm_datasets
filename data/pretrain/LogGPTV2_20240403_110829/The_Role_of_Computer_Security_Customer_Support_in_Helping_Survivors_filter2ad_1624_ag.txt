A Focus Group Protocol: IPV Professionals
Part 1: Introduction. Thank you all for taking the time to talk to us. We’re
researchers from [institutions]. [Company] provides cybersecurity software
and services like [products].
[Company] offers customer support hotlines and online chats to help their
customers deal with tech-related issues. There are instances in which the
caller appears to be in a dangerous situation, such as stalking and domestic
violence. [Company] wants to better assist these callers and understand the
appropriate scope for their customer support in doing so.
Today’s meeting will be primarily discussion-based with a few activities.
There are no right or wrong answers to any of our questions. We’re simply
interested in your opinions based on your own experiences or perspectives.
You can choose not to comment and you can quit the session at any point.
We would also like to get your consent to audio record the workshop
session as a backup of our notes. These will be transcribed, all identifying
information will be removed, and we will destroy the original recordings
once the transcription is done. Are you ok with us recording the meeting?
Do you have any other questions before we get started?
• Let’s go around the room with brief introductions. Please tell us your
name, job title, and how many years you have been doing this job.
• Have you ever worked directly with clients? Have you encountered
clients who have experienced IPV?
• Have you encountered clients who have experienced tech-related
abuse? Can you give an example?
Part 2: Presenting and Discussing Customer Support Scenarios. Now
we’d like to present a few example customer support transcripts and get your
expert opinions on these interactions. These transcripts are based on real
chats, but have been shortened and identifying information removed. We’ll
let you read each scenario and ask a few follow-up questions.
IPV professionals’ advice to this customer Ignoring the technical aspect
of this problem, imagine someone were to come to you with this problem:
• Are these problems similar to or different from the cases you normally
receive at your organization? In what ways?
• What advice would you give based on the available information?
IPV professionals’ advice to the support agent Now let’s think about this
customer’s interaction with customer support...
• In your opinion, what could the customer support agent offer this
customer beyond assistance with [product name]?
• Are there additional questions that customer support should be asking?
• Are there resources customer support could have shared?
• In your opinion, should customer support point to other organizations,
such as shelters or the police? Why or why not? How might it be done?
• Should customer support provide speciﬁc advice about safety plan-
ning? Why or why not? How might it be done?
Factors that might complicate advice Let’s discuss a few factors that make
the situation trickier. For each case, should the support agent react differently
in your opinion, why or why not?
• What if the agent thinks the attacker is recording/listening to the chat?
• What if the customer is not alone when the call takes place?
• What if the attacker could be calling to access a victim’s account?
Part 3: General Advice Going Beyond the Scenarios. Now that we’ve
looked at some examples of the problems that customer support gets, let’s
think about the broader role that customer support can play in providing
support to victims of abuse.
• Under what circumstances, if any, do you think that customer sup-
port’s duty to help extends beyond addressing product-speciﬁc issues
identiﬁed by the customer?
• In your opinion, should customer support try to identify situations in
which the caller may need additional safety planning advice? Why or
why not? What can customer support do to identify such situations?
• Should customer support watch out for cues suggesting further ques-
tions are unsafe (e.g., due to monitored)? Why or why not?
• How should customer support respond if a customer reveals personal,
sensitive information about an assault or suicide?
• What training or education do you think the support rep could have to
help them avoid adverse outcomes? E.g., About IPV and risks related
to leaving an abuser? About resources to share?
B Focus Group Protocol: Support Agents
Introduction. We are conducting a research study around technology and
intimate partner abuse. We are exploring how security companies can help
IPV survivors through their customer support. So far we’ve conducted ﬁve
focus groups with about 20 experts in this space, such as social workers and
legal advocates, to collect their feedback on this topic. We now want to talk
to you as customer support practitioners and security experts, to understand
how effective, efﬁcient, and practical some of these ideas are. After our talk
today, we plan to develop recommendations from these insights and integrate
them into guidelines and training materials for customer support agents, and
we’re happy to share them with you.
Part 1: Study Background. We conducted 5 focus groups with profession-
als to seek advice about how security companies can support IPV survivors.
We presented three scenarios, created based on real chat transcripts from
[Company], and asked participants how customer support could do better. The
ideas we elicited from IPV professionals are not ﬁnal. Participants sometimes
disagreed with each other, and also mentioned the challenges and constraints
of some of the ideas.
We’d like to ask some open questions about your organization:
• How is your customer support team organized?
• What are evaluation metrics for success for customer support agents?
We’d now like to ask about your experiences with IPV at your company.
• Have you or your employees encountered similar cases that involve
IPV/technology abuse?
• What are your company’s current efforts for supporting IPV survivors
that you’re aware of?
We will present our ﬁndings in four parts. During our presentation, please
feel free to chime in whenever you have any questions or comments. At the
end of each part we’ll have a short summary and discussion to ask you some
speciﬁc questions about what we shared with you and get your feedback. We
expect each session to take about 12 minutes, and we’ll leave a few minutes
at the end of today’s meeting to wrap up and discuss next steps.
Part 2: Interacting with customers. Suggestions from IPV professionals:
• Explain why a product would be helpful • Avoid overpromising • Ask
more probing questions
• What are your reactions to these suggestions? Comments or feedback?
• Do you think it is feasible?
• How much of this would you say is your team already doing?
• Would this create conﬂict with your evaluation metrics of support
agents, such as the rate of “resolving issues?” If yes, Is there any way
to mitigate such conﬂict?
• Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?
• Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?
Part 3: Advice given to customers. What role do you think customer sup-
port should play in providing technical assistance vs. going beyond?
Suggestions from IPV professionals: • Discuss potential consequences of
given advice • Provide resources for best security and safety practices
• What are your reactions to these suggestions? Comments or feedback?
• Have your employees already been discussing consequences of advice?
If yes, could you give us an example?
• Are there downsides of discussing potential consequences of advice?
• What resources do your support agents refer customers to about secu-
rity and safety practices? How often do they do this?
• Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?
• Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?
USENIX Association
30th USENIX Security Symposium    445
Part 4: Making referrals. Suggestions from IPV professionals: • Refer
customers to a specialized team within the company • Make external referrals
based on trigger words
• What are your reactions to these suggestions? Comments or feedback?
• Do you already have a multi-tiered support system? What types of
cases get transferred or escalated?
• How feasible do you think is it to have a specialized team within your
company to deal with IPV/tech abuse?
• Do your support reps already refer customers to resources outside of
the company? If yes, for what types of problems?
• From your experience, how difﬁcult would it be to identify these cases?
What are the challenges?
• Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?
• Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?
Part 5: Training materials. Suggestions from IPV professionals: • Have
agents be familiar with common tech abuse cases • Train agents for trauma-
informed responses • Ensure the well-being of support agents
• What are your reactions to these suggestions? Comments or feedback?
• Have you embedded training for empathetic or trauma-informed re-
sponses in your current training materials/scripts?
• Are you already doing anything to prepare agents to handle difﬁcult /
traumatic customer issues?
• What have you done to ensure the well-being of your employees?
Could anything be done better?
• Do you see any challenges or concerns with these suggestions?
• Do you have ideas about how this could be done differently?
Closing. We want to use the insights from our work with IPV experts and
customer support teams, like you, to develop guidelines and training materials
for integrating IPV support into customer support. If you’re interested, we
will share materials with you when we have drafted them.
C Focus Group Analysis Codebook
We provide our codebook in the following format: category (counts of
belonging codes): a list of codes.
IPV Professionals
C.1
Advice to IPV survivors (3): adopt good security practices, document ev-
idence, replace compromised devices • Advice on agent-customer inter-
action (10): avoid overpromising, avoid assumptions of IPV, avoid victim
blaming, ask questions to better diagnose the situation, ask about the cus-
tomer’s top concern, explain how the product solves existing problems, give
the customer decision-making agency, make disclaimers about the advice’s
consequences, role in safety planning, use more empathetic language • Ad-
vice on customer support coordination (10): build long-term relationships
with the customer, change the evaluation metrics, refer to a specialized team,
refer to external resources, refer to IPV advocacy organizations and hotlines,
refer to law enforcement, refer to legal experts, refer to trafﬁcking-speciﬁc
resources, responsibilities of the IPV-specialized team, track the scale of
cases • Advice on customer support training (4): trauma-informed re-
sponses, capture red ﬂag words, assess the situation, know common forms
of tech abuse • Challenges of customer support (8): advice may create
additional danger, loop between IPV advocates and tech companies, complex
structure of existing resources, go overboard with asking questions, issues
in transferring calls, make assumptions of IPV victim status, pressure of
getting things done, support agents might overreact • Negative aspects of
customer support (5): dismissive language, give a false sense of security,
no trauma-informed responses, responses too product-focused, responses too
script-based • Positive aspects of customer support (2): ask open-ended
probing questions, use empathetic language • Adverse scenarios: advice
on customer support (7): be vague in calling back, check if line is secure,
do not ask for PII, explain potential risks, redirect to another phone, spot
red ﬂags for impersonation, verify customer’s identity • Adverse scenarios:
challenges of customer support (2): advice tips off abuser, limited channels
for communication • Miscellaneous (9): participants’ job roles, participants’
experience with tech abuse cases, adverse scenarios are rare, coalition be-
tween tech companies and advocates, connection between IPV and human
trafﬁcking, ensure the well-being of support agents, generational divide in in-
teracting with mobile devices, provide free services for IPV survivors, shared
responsibility between tech companies
C.2 Customer Support
Challenges to suggestions (14): an independent team may not be feasible,
infrequent IPV cases mean they’ll be mishandled, agents are international,
concern about sharing correct resources, uncertainty about ability to help,
unqualiﬁed or untrained agents could cause problems, scripting could lead
to overpromising, identifying survivors is challenging, customer support is
already overworked, uncertainty about successfully identifying tech in IPV,
stalkerware might be dual-use, attacker might be listening to support conver-
sation, training will need to be regular, agents can’t make the customer take
the suggested action • Suggestions that already exist (7): asking probing
questions & not overpromising, escalating unusual cases to experts, sharing
external resources, providing general tech best-practices to customers, using
empathetic language, hosting resources on stalkerware, escalation team is
familiar with IPV • Supportive comments (10): making agents aware of
IPV is worthwhile, IPV survivors need specialized advice, all agents should
be trained on IPV, agents also need support when handling IPV cases, empa-
thetic language helps everyone, agents should ask more questions to avoid
overpromising, adding additional external referrals is achievable, having
a dedicated team for IPV cases is good, training agents on IPV is good,
agents should consider ramiﬁcations of their advice • Comments on how
participants or company think about the problem (Values) (6): customer
satisfaction is a priority, trust among agents is important, the product is the
agent’s primary responsibility, customer needs to have conﬁdence in their
tech, the product is a solution, need to balance accuser’s v abuser’s rights •
Agents’ metrics for evaluation (4): customer satisfaction, throughput, min-
imizing open cases, quality assurance review • New ideas for addressing
the problem (6): create company-wide awareness campaign, create new
resources for customers, track number of IPV cases, make training story-
based, create a standard operating procedure for IPV customers, provide
basic digital training to customers • Miscellaneous (2): participant shared
tech advice, participant shared a story about supporting a customer
