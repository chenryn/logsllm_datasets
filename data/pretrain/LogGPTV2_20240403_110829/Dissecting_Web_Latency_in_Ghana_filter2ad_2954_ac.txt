5.4 SPDY vs TCP Optimizations
SPDY [8] is an application layer protocol proposed to en-
hance the webpage loading time. The SPDY protocol in-
cludes header compression and allows servers to send back
additional responses without the client asking for them, e.g.,
the server might send back the style sheet of a page along
with the HTML, which can speed up the page load time.
Since blocking was an issue we identiﬁed in Section 4.3,
we wanted to examine the utility of SPDY, as it oﬀers the
potential to reduce the overhead of blocking times. We re-
quested 42 pages from four diﬀerent locations: Accra, Abu
Dhabi, Bremen, and New York.3 Each experiment was re-
peated ﬁve times to have enough randomness for a better
CDF population. Figure 9 shows the overall comparison
between SPDY and HTTP for all locations.
For the 42 websites that supported SPDY in our exper-
iments, we have found that SPDY does not show signiﬁ-
cant performance gain compared to regular HTTP in devel-
oped regions (e.g., New York, Bremen). Whereas, in Accra,
SPDY shows a performance gain in the upper 40% of the
page load times. This is because SPDY reduces the number
of TCP connections by multiplexing HTTP requests into a
single TCP connection per domain. As found in [32], SPDY
reduces the page load times especially for links with less
bandwidth and higher RTTs.

In Ghana where the connections are latency, not band-
width, constrained (at least for the purposes of web brows-
ing), SDPY is a better solution than multiple TCP connec-
tions. Almost all popular browsers are conﬁgured by default
to use multiple persistent TCP connections when download-
ing a page over HTTP to avoid HOL blocking, but increasing
the number of persistent TCP connections does not always
improve the HTTP performance [27]. Furthermore, in devel-
oping countries where the bandwidth is scarce and sharing
is high, increasing the number of TCP sessions can degrade
HTTP performance [16].
5.5 TLS/SSL Speedups
Although the TLS protocol has a resume handshake that
signiﬁcantly reduces the handshake traﬃc and latency, it re-
quires the server to store the TLS session in its cache. Thus,
many servers store the TLS session only for a short period
of time resulting in the full handshake being used instead.
Approximately 15% of our latest web requests contained
a secure connection establishment handshake.
Improving
handshake procedure can reduce the overall load time, and
combining the handshake with SPDY can potentially im-

computational load on the servers [3].
Fast-Track [28] is a proposed mechanism where the server’s
public and negotiated parameters are cached at the client
side, since the server’s parameters are nearly static. This
helps reduce the overall TLS handshake traﬃc and the num-
ber of RTTs required, thus providing substantial gain in high
latency developing countries. Unfortunately, Fast-Track re-
quires modiﬁcations to both the client and the server side
by means of TLS extensions and not all servers will have the
Fast-Track support option implemented. We do not present
measurements of the potential of TLS/SSL speedups of these
solutions because they require control over the server.
6. OTHER RELATED WORK
There is a wide range of related work in the networking
literature and we include in this section only works we have
not yet referenced. Stream Control Transmission Protocol
(SCTP) is a transport-layer protocol to replace TCP, which
provides multiplexed streams and stream-aware congestion
control [29]. HTTP 1.1 over SCTP may be used to avoid the
HOL blocking problem where when one transport protocol
data unit (TPDU) is lost, TCP does not deliver successive
TPDUs until the one that is lost is recovered. Structured
Stream Transport (SST) is a protocol that uses “structured
streams”:
lightweight, independent streams to be carried
over a common transport sharing the same congestion con-
trol context [22].
Recent work [32] investigates the conditions under which
SPDY provides improvements over HTTP. The work shows
that SPDY performs better when few network losses, high
RTTs and low bandwidth are given. We corroborate these
ﬁndings for high RTT conditions in developing countries like
Ghana.
In [21], the authors propose a simple solution to
increase TCP’s initial window size to at least ten segments,
which may also help for developing regions.
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have presented an analysis of the key fac-
tors that trigger high end-to-end latency for web page down-
loads in Ghana. From our measurements over the past two
years, we observed that DNS is a critical bottleneck in page
load times and even the deployment of simple ideas such as
DNS caching can help improve the end-to-end performance.
Apart from DNS, we found that because of the lack of server
infrastructure within the country, every request needs to be
routed to US or European countries thereby incurring a high
network latency penalty; hence, even simple operations such
as HTTP redirections and TLS/SSL handshakes represent a
non-trivial fraction of the page load time. We experimented
with a host of well known optimizations and describe the
eﬀectiveness of some of the promising approaches including
DNS caching, DNS server placement, caching redirects, us-
ing SPDY, and TLS/SSL speedups.
