User:  To automate configuration with Ansible, write a Playbook to deploy a web application.
Assistant: Here is an example of a possible Ansible Playbook that can be used to automate the deployment of a web application: ``` --- - name: Deploy web application hosts: web_servers tasks: # Step 1: Install required packages - name: Install required packages apt: name : "{{ item }}" state: present with_items: - apache2 - php - libapache2-mod-php - git # Step 2: Clone web application code - name: Clone web application code from repository git: repo: https:// github.com/your_username/your_repository.git dest: /var/www/html/your_app/ update: yes # Step 3: Configure Apache virtual host - name: Configure Apache virtual host for web application copy: src: /path/to/ your_app.conf dest: /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_app.conf notify: - Enable Apache virtual host for web application # Step 4: Enable Apache virtual host - name: Enable Apache virtual host for web application command: a2ensite your_app. conf args: creates: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/your_app.conf notify: - Restart Apache service # Step 5: Restart Apache service - name: Restart Apache service service: name: apache2 state: restarted ``` The above Playbook contains The following steps: 1. Install the required packages (such as Apache, PHP, mod_php and Git) in the web server. 2. Clone the web application code from the code repository and copy it to a specified directory on the web server. 3. Configure the Apache virtual host with the specified configuration file to run the web application. 4. Enable Apache virtual host to serve the web application. 5. Restart the Apache service to ensure that the web application is properly configured and running. Note that some information in this example playbook, such as the web server hostname and configuration file path, needs to be replaced according to your environment. You also need to specify other variables (such as Git repository URL, web application name, etc.) and set the application code base to the git repository.
