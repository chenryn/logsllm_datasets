of fusion rules will be carefully selected according to the need of the scheme,
as those were underlined above. The ﬁnal experiments will be conducted on
datasets of real and spoofed biometric elements. The overall accuracy and
privacy evaluation will be determinant for the acceptance of the methods.
6 Conclusion
The paper represents an attempt to acknowledge and account the biometric
schemes using combination of cryptography with biometric characteristics and
how this could play an increasing role in electronic documents and transactions
for identifying a person, limiting security risks. Current methods and their
design suﬀer from vulnerabilities, and here is where measures become crucial in
order to protect schemes and the overall eﬃciency of government and commercial
applications. Spooﬁng attacks at the sensor level of a system used for automatic
recognition of people from their biometric characteristics have been tackled by
independent and/or collaborated to initial design and application, anti-spooﬁng
attempts [135]. To appraise data protection problems, multimodalities, current
research developments on suggestions against invasive actions and a prototype
face-ﬁngerprint/iris cryptosystem have been presented. Create an all-inclusive
view, we believe that this project will help to better evaluate the impact of
spooﬁng attacks from a security and privacy engineering aspect, contributing
to ongoing and expected attempts in pattern recognition area.
In outcome’s atmosphere, the application of biometrics in diﬀerent services
requires high accuracy rates, secure personal information storage and reliable
generation of data while the whole process of transfer is proof. Identity thief
might exploit in occasion of low protection levels. Even so, some modalities are
more robust than others, however, this should not be interpreted as meaning they
are more reliable [82]. Spooﬁng and countermeasure assessments are a complex
part for each study as it is mandatory to think all the involved possibilities and
design generic frameworks with a manageable impact of usability. Challenge-
response approaches seem to be supplementary to the traditional ones and more
eﬀective for risky applications. The standard evaluation methodology during
the phases of the architecture can lead to better independent networks and
fused countermeasures as a valuable strategy.
FUTURE RESEARCH
81
For some conditions, even if anti-spooﬁng measures could adequately assessed,
the rapid progress of adversaries’ actions at the initial steps of veriﬁcation
purposes throw up wider concerns on public narratives of privacy and frequent
monitoring of individuals. The advancement of theory on secured access control
and practical design implementations of the provided valuable experience on
technologies will improve their robustness.
7 Future Research
Directions for further research and open issues may be focused on anti-spooﬁng
techniques for biometric multimodalities and their combinations, seeking to
reduce the diﬀerent degrees of deception/lying while enhancing the proper
function of the system. An anti-spooﬁng method is not constructed to operate
as a stand-alone procedure but together with the biometric recognition system.
During the design process the error recognition rates should be taken into
consideration. Cryptography can oﬀer signiﬁcant, but inadequate solutions
in this emerging technology, and thus next steps on encryption schemes may
promote the security strength against intrusive attacks. Multibiometric systems
can be easily cracked by spooﬁng at least only one trait and future works
should ﬂatly investigate how to bring robust results on score level fusion rules
and provide protocols for provable secure authentication based on template
protection schemes.
From another angle, state-of-the-art suggests the use of DBs for spooﬁng
and anti-spooﬁng analysis but still lacks to cover all the possible scenarios
and certainly the implementation in real-world applications. The problem of
generalization should be addressed as well, due to the fact that current ﬁndings
may cover individual occasions for some biometric traits, leaving gaps to varying
areas of a system that veriﬁes or identiﬁes biometrically the users. Concurrently,
the missing pieces of the puzzle for better approaches may lie at the combination
of diﬀerent anti-spooﬁng algorithms. Liveness detection eﬀorts, and challenge
approaches with the cooperation of user, could be tested to oﬀer advantages
versus tricks that can fool existing systems.
Apart from the design ideas and open research questions on the protected
operation of the system, the major themes of human privacy and rights to
anonymization, facing the obstacles of societal suspicions over surveillance,
and other speciﬁed and legitimate services should be covered. Decisively, the
starting setup is vital for the entire ﬁeld. Human biometrics may be collected
and processed under detailed protocols, compatible and related to the scope
of the authority involved in the transaction. The procedure should respect

proportionality and serve the forensic experts thoughts on the prevention of
spooﬁng, where we may proﬁt more from a careful appraisal of the processes,
supporting the structure of the biometric system.

Abstract. Biometric designs have attracted attention in practical
technological schemes with high requirements in terms of accuracy,
security and privacy. Nevertheless, multimodalities have been
approached with skepticism, as fusion deployments are aﬀected
by performance metrics. In this paper, we introduce a basic
fusion model blueprint for a privacy-preserving cloud-based
user veriﬁcation/authentication. We consider the case of three
modalities, permanently located in diﬀerent DBs of semi-honest
providers, being combined according to their strength performance
parameters, in a user-speciﬁc weighted score level fusion. Secure
multiparty computation techniques are utilized for protecting
conﬁdentiality and privacy among the parties.

1 Introduction
Over the last decade, biometric-based systems have been part of the daily
routine for identity veriﬁcation. This is specially true for online services. Moving
the existing technology to cloud-based platforms could be proven eﬀective
for many access control or surveillance applications with millions of users.
Nevertheless, with all eyes on security, privacy challenges encountered in the
transmission of personal data across the parties could be characterized as
extremely serious. The reader could take into account the following attacking
scenarios [21,64]. Additionally, to store several biometric templates under the
same user’s identity in one DB could not only be a diﬃcult feat, considering
the restricted access on templates from competing biometric suppliers, but
85

also discouraged or illegal [116]. Multibiometrics were originally introduced
to alleviate the inherent limitations of single biometric modalities that render
them unable to correspond at the high security requirements. Furthermore, the
conﬁdence on the functionality of a biometric scheme is determined by some
speciﬁc metrics: False Acceptance Rate (FAR) shows if a system incorrectly
recognizes an intruder while False Rejection Rate (FRR), the percentage of valid
inputs which are incorrectly rejected for an authorized person. Being inspired
by biometric applications on cloud we introduce a model for a veriﬁcation
protocol based on fusion and designed to operate in a cloud environment for
privacy-preserving biometric recognition and identiﬁcation purposes.
To reduce privacy threats, we employ secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC),
thus avoiding any centralized repository and using the stored templates by the
service providers in a decentralized manner. That way we can authenticate an
individual based on his/her biometric characteristics, searching, matching and
combining the results, and return a reliable decision guaranteeing the secrecy of
the new (fresh/raw) and old (stored) biometric templates. Applications include
a cloud-based border control system that integrates stored unimodal biometrics
by a set of diﬀerent recognition services, evaluating them accordingly to their
FAR to prevent access to unauthorized individuals. Contrary, a cloud-based
surveillance solution, operating to automatically screen the crowd in order to
identify a person sets up a FRR respective fusion mechanism. We refer the
reader to [17,49,58,141] for a more detailed treatment on MPC.
Contribution: We provide a view of a decentralized cloud based mechanism
for multimodal user veriﬁcation, using distrustful DB providers. The service is
provided under strong privacy-preserving constraints, where the only thing the
involved entity learns is the ﬁnal output.
Our main contribution includes the following:
• The design uses previously stored unimodals, providing the advantage of
handling information without extra unnecessarily storage of fused data.
• We incorporate FAR and FRR rates of uncorrelated biometrics in a user-
speciﬁc transformation-based score level fusion. Weights are assigned to
each trait according to its strength performance.
• Since biometric data transmitted across the network and design involves
various distrustful service providers, MPC is considered to be a suitable
mechanism for the execution of our protocols. In this way, no information
related to the raw, stored or the ﬁnal output is revealed to the cloud
parties.
ENVIRONMENT AND SETTINGS
87
Motivation: Even though several proposals on multimodal fusion, performance
rates and secure cloud-based biometric applications can be found in the literature,
the combination of these results seems to be a challenging task. Given that
utilizing more than two biometrics oﬀers improved identiﬁcation eﬃciency [180],
we make use of the three most popular and robust biometric body traits (face,
iris and ﬁngerprint) for our model. However, the concept of integration is
considered as an open problem [182], and it is an undeniable admission since
that we assume a cloud-based setting induces many privacy risks. Thus, it
is necessary to enhance security between the non-trust parties, protecting
intermediate computations and user’s information. The novelty of our model
lies on bridging the gaps of cloud-based multimodal biometric veriﬁcation or
identiﬁcation, ensuring the privacy between the involved entities and the user,
whenever data transmitted across the network.
2 Environment and Settings
The scenario is as follows: an involved entity provides the fresh biometric
templates to three unimodal cloud biometric service providers that store old
templates of faces, irises and ﬁngerprints, separately. The involved entity needs
to verify/authenticate a user’s identity with better accuracy than when operating
with single modal module. The veriﬁcation process takes place in the cloud
and has to guarantee the privacy of the user’s data (fresh and old templates).
Figure 1 illustrates the generic form of the proposed biometric authentication
access control system.
Parties and Roles: Parties involved in our protocol fulﬁll at least one or more
of the following roles during the veriﬁcation process:
- Dealers: Any subset of parties that provide the private inputs for
the computation in shared/encrypted to the parties responsible of the
computation (computational parties). In our case, an involved entity
delivers the fresh extracted features, and the service providers are the
owners of the stored templates. Both have also to provide other metrics,
the proportions, thresholds and rates in shared form as well.
- Computational Parties: Any subset of parties in charge of the
computation. They are also in charge of communicating the necessary
results of the computation to the output parties in shared form. Typically,
the computational parties are distrustful parties with competing interests,
in the case at hand they could be represented by the service providers or
any coalition composed by control agencies, service providers and civil
entities.

- Output Parties: Any subset of parties in charge of the reconstruction
the output. These parties are the only ones who learn the output and
what can be inferred from it. In our setting, this role is occupied by the
involved entity.
On privacy and security: it follows from the underlying MPC primitives used
SYSTEM OUTLINE
89
(for instance perfect security with BGW [17]), and the oblivious nature of the
future protocol.
3 System Outline
1. The involved entity needs to verify a user’s identity based obligingly on
three biometric inputs. It obtains the user’s data (a physical presentation
of an identiﬁcation document). Features are acquired sequentially and
processed in a cascade mode.
2. The three new biometric templates and the identity references are
transmitted across the network. Service providers then use this information
to extract and secretly share the old templates, or return a dummy instead.
3. During the next phase, a feature matching algorithm, such as Hamming
Distance algorithms, or similarity measurement methods are used to give
a degree of comparison between the new and old templates.
4. Next, service providers choose the speciﬁed value of the reference
thresholds. These calculations on unibiometric features come from the
service providers. The process can be improved from genuine and
impostor training samples distributions available from the enrolled users
in monomodal veriﬁcation/identiﬁcation functions of their systems. Note
that this undertaking is out of the scope of the current work.
5. On the basis of the selected thresholds, where monomodal system performs
better in a such a way that the corresponding FAR is as low as possible
and respecting the requirements of the application that operates in
veriﬁcation/authentication mode, the matching score that mostly reﬂects
the similarity between the new and one of the old stored template set is
selected from the generated vector for each modality, respectively.
6. The matching module output by three non-homogeneous biometrics and
consequently scores have to be transformed into a common domain, before
combination. The application has to normalize the results in the cloud by
placing the three obtained matching scores in the same numerical range
varied over {0, .., 1}. Fractional representation can be utilized for its MPC
adaptation.
7. Weights are selected by the involved entity (according to the FAR, FRR
that each service provider considers to be permissible). These weights,
assigned to the three modalities, are in the range of {0, ..., 1} for the
user u as wf ace,u, wiris,u and wf ingerprint,u, such that the constraint
90
A PRIVACY-PRESERVING MODEL FOR BIOMETRIC FUSION
wf ace,u + wiris,u + wf ingerprint,u = 1 is satisﬁed. As before, fractional
representation can be used during our MPC adaptation.
8. Normalized matching scores are fused in ideally to output one from three.
A user-speciﬁc weighted sum rule is then applied in order to determine the
ﬁnal result of the score level fusion for multimodal identity veriﬁcation.
9. Finally, the involved entity determines a threshold ⊥ and communicates
it to the computational parties. The ﬁnal acceptance happens in case of
an individual has been authenticated as a previously successfully enrolled
user. Regarding rejection, this simply means that the system failed to
surpass the threshold ⊥, not leaking whether the user is enrolled or not
on any or all the DBs.
4 Usability and Limitations
Usability: The generic veriﬁcation model introduced by this paper incorporates
three popular and well-studied modalities into a fusion method, operating in
cloud. Note that the system could operate in identiﬁcation mode, without
requesting the presence of a credential by the user, where the biometric templates
are contrasted against the hole DB. Thus, the proposal could be used in identity
