ABSTRACT
Post-quantum schemes are expected to replace existing public-key
schemes within a decade in billions of devices. To facilitate the
transition, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology
(NIST) is running a standardization process. Multivariate signatures
is one of the main categories in NIST‚Äôs post-quantum cryptogra-
phy competition. Among the four candidates in this category, the
LUOV and Rainbow schemes are based on the Oil and Vinegar
scheme, first introduced in 1997 which has withstood over two
decades of cryptanalysis. Beyond mathematical security and effi-
ciency, security against side-channel attacks is a major concern
in the competition. The current sentiment is that post-quantum
schemes may be more resistant to fault-injection attacks due to
their large key sizes and the lack of algebraic structure. We show
that this is not true.
We introduce a novel hybrid attack, QuantumHammer, and
demonstrate it on the constant-time implementation of LUOV cur-
rently in Round 2 of the NIST post-quantum competition. The
QuantumHammer attack is a combination of two attacks, a bit-
tracing attack enabled via Rowhammer fault injection and a divide
and conquer attack that uses bit-tracing as an oracle. Using bit-
tracing, an attacker with access to faulty signatures collected using
Rowhammer attack, can recover secret key bits albeit slowly. We
employ a divide and conquer attack which exploits the structure in
the key generation part of LUOV and solves the system of equations
for the secret key more efficiently with few key bits recovered via
bit-tracing.
We have demonstrated the first successful in-the-wild attack
on LUOV recovering all 11K key bits with less than 4 hours of
an active Rowhammer attack. The post-processing part is highly
parallel and thus can be trivially sped up using modest resources.
QuantumHammer does not make any unrealistic assumptions, only
requires software co-location (no physical access), and therefore
can be used to target shared cloud servers or in other sandboxed
environments.

key schemes such as RSA and ECC insecure. Shor‚Äôs algorithm [41]

log problems. Quantum computers will also affect symmetric-key
cryptosystems, but their impact can be overcome by mildly increas-
ing key sizes. For instance, using Grover‚Äôs search algorithm [20]
one may brute force a 128-bit secure system in 264 iterations. In
key schemes from ùëÇ(ùëÅ) to ùëÇ(‚àö
general, Grover‚Äôs algorithm reduces the complexity of symmetric-
ùëÅ), where log2(ùëÅ) is the security
level in bits. Hence, doubling the key size may be a solution to
retain the security level.
The US NIST has recently started a competition for quantum
secure public-key cryptosystems for digital signatures, Public-Key
Encryption (PKE) and Key-Establishment Mechanisms (KEMs) [33].
In the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Standardization
process [1], 26 schemes passed the first round and are currently com-
peting in the second round, of which 9 are digital signature schemes.
The evaluation criteria consists of three major components security,
cost and performance and algorithm and implementation charac-
teristics.
Based on the underlying hard problems, the submissions are di-
vided into 5 broad categories: lattice-based, code-based, hash-based,
isogeny-based and multivariate schemes. These categories have
different characteristics with varying key sizes and performances.
Multivariate is one of the main categories which is known to be
very efficient for resource constraint devices but on the other hand,
the key sizes are quite large. Under this category, there are four
signature schemes namely GeMSS, LUOV, MQDSS and Rainbow.
MQDSS is based on the Fiat-Shamir construction and GeMSS is
a faster variant of QUARTZ. Lifted Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar
(LUOV) is an improvement of the Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar
(UOV) scheme with smaller public keys. Rainbow is an extension
of UOV with an additional oil layer.
A number of side-channel attacks have been performed on PQC
schemes. Bruinderink et al. [8] performed the first side-channel
attack on lattice-based signature schemes in 2016, specifically a
flush and reload attack on BLISS. The attack was extended to BLISS-
B by Pessl et al. [36]. Both of these attacks targeted the Bernoulli and
CDT sampling. An extension to this work was presented by Bootle
et al. [6] which manages to recover 100% of the secret key compared
to only 7% in the previous work [17]. Another side-channel attack
by Ravi et al. [37] achieving existential forgery targeted Dilithium,
a lattice-based signature scheme.
A more recent timing attack focused on the error-correcting
codes used in lattice-based schemes by D‚ÄôAnvers et al. [12] in 2019.
Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack has also been shown to
be effective by Park et al. [34] on Rainbow and UOV. The early
timing attacks motivated a number of efforts to design constant-
time discrete gaussian samplers, i.e. [25, 26, 49]. In fact, many of
the NIST submissions, including LUOV, provided constant-time
implementations to eliminate any passive side-channel attacks. The
NIST Round 2 version of LUOV, specifically added a random salt for
every message and required randomly generated vinegars to defend
against the side-channel and fault injection attacks.
A more recent noteworthy work by Ding et al. [13, 15] pre-
sented a (purely) algebraic attack, i.e. the subfield differential at-
tack. Without any side-channel information, the attack managed
to significantly reduce the security level of LUOV. Specifically, for
LUOV-8-58-237, the complexity is reduced from 2146 to 2105 which
is lower than the minimum security level criteria established by
NIST for the post-quantum competition. The updated version of
LUOV now uses finite fields ùê∫ùêπ(2ùëü), where r is a prime, which
renders the subfield differential attack inapplicable1
There is some research aimed at evaluating the resilience of
post-quantum schemes against fault attacks. Genet et al. [19] have
demonstrated a fault attack on a hash-based digital signature scheme
SPHINCS. Another differential fault attack was introduced by Bruin-
derink et al. [9] on deterministic lattice signatures. Espitau et al.
[16] have presented fault attacks on lattice based signature schemes
BLISS, GLP, PASSSign and Ring-TESLA. Blindel et al. [4] have also
applied fault attacks on lattice based signature schemes namely
BLISS, ring-TESLA and GLP. Ravi et al. [38] have presented fault at-
tacks on lattice based schemes NewHope, Kyber, Frodo and Dilithium.
This research is based on hardware faults like electromagnetic fault
injections and clock glitches. Post-quantum schemes are more diffi-
cult to attack via side-channel or fault attacks due to their massive
keys that run into many KBytes in many cases and the lack of alge-
braic structure. Collecting KBytes through slow bit-flips or leakages
observed by the attacker over extended durations is impractical
since its highly unlikely for a victim to be present and continu-
ously running the target cryptographic primitive. Therefore, small
side-channel leakages and fewer faults may not entirely break the
scheme. On the other hand, these schemes are based on strong
post-quantum (conjectured) hard problems which have withstood
years of cryptanalysis. Here we opt for a different attack strategy,
i.e., we analyze LUOV using a combination of fault injections while
simultaneously targeting the algebraic structure. Hence we follow
a hybrid attack strategy.
1.1 Our Contribution
We have discovered a practical technique which recovers all se-
cret key bits in LUOV. QuantumHammer proceeds by injecting
faults, collecting faulty signatures, followed by the divide and con-
quer attack. The faults are achieved using a realistic software only
approach via a Rowhammer attack. In summary, in this work:
(1) We introduce a simple technique that uses faulty signatures
to mathematically trace and recover key bits. Each faulty
signature yields a key bit. While not efficient, the technique
gives us a tool we then amplify the efficiency of our attack
using a analytical approach.
(2) The analytical attack exploits structures in the generation
of the public key using a small number of recovered key bits
(using a modest number of faults injections), the complexity
of attacking the overall multivariate system reduced to a

number of much smaller MV problems, which are tractable
with modest resources using brute force.
(3) Our attack is software only, i.e. we do not assume any phys-
ical access to the device. This also permits remote attacks
on shared cloud servers or in browsers. We assume that
the memory module is susceptible to Rowhammer and that
faulty signatures can be recovered.
(4) Earlier fault attacks on post-quantum schemes assumed hy-
pothetical faults. We present a successful end-to-end Rowham-
mer attack on constant-time AVX2 optimized implementation
of the multivariate post-quantum signature scheme LUOV.
(5) We have demonstrated full key recovery of 11,229 bits for
LUOV-7-57-197 in less than 4 hours of online Rowhammer
attack and 49 hours of offline post-processing.
(6) This attack is applicable to all the variants of LUOV Scheme
currently competing in Round 2 of NIST‚Äôs competition in-
cluding the updates [44] after Ding et al. attack [15].

and Section 8 concludes the work.
1.3 Related Work
On Rainbow-like schemes, Ding et al. [14] introduced an algebraic
Reconciliation attack as an early work in 2008. Afterwards, as for
fault attacks on multivariate schemes, only a few results exist: In
2011 by Hashimoto et al. [23] on Big Field type and Stepwise Trian-
gular System (STS) including UOV and Rainbow. In 2019, Kramer
et al. [30] have also worked on UOV and Rainbow extending the
earlier work. We will only talk about UOV and Rainbow in this
section and not the Big Field type schemes. Reconciliation is an
algebraic attack whereas other two works assume physical fault
attacks, first introduced by Boneh et al. [5] but there are no details
on fault injection technique. Kramer et al. claimed that randomness
of vinegar variables and also the layers in Rainbow provide good
protection against fault attacks. These studies consider there attack
scenarios:
Scenario 1 (Algebraic Attack) In this scenario [14], we assume
a purely algebraic attack that improves on brute force but does
not assume any physical fault or any side channel information.
Specifically, the aim is to invert the public map P by finding a
sequence of change of basis matrices. P is decomposed into a series
of linear transformations which are recovered step by step which
significantly reduces the security level.
Scenario 2 (Central Map) It assumes that a coefficient of the
secret quadratic central map F has been faulted. By signing ran-
domly chosen messages with the faulty F ‚Ä≤ and verifying the sig-
natures with the correct public key P, partial information about
the secret linear transformation matrix S can be recovered using
ùõø = S ‚ó¶ (F ‚Ä≤ ‚àí F) ‚ó¶ T , where T is another secret linear transfor-
mation matrix. As (F ‚Ä≤ ‚àí F) is sparse, S can be partially recovered.
At least ùëö ‚àí 1 faults are required to recover some part of the secret
key matrix S, where ùëö is the number of equations in the system.
Both [23] and [30] have an assumption that the attack can induce
faults in either S, F or T and provided the success probabilities of
hitting the central map F . Kramer et al. have additionally assumed
a stronger attacker who can directly attack F or even specific coef-
ficients of F to avoid unwanted scenarios. Kramer et al. [30] refute
a claim made earlier by Hashimoto et al. [23] and claim that UOV
is immune to the fault attack on the central map. It is because the
attack is recovering part of S and not T , which is not present in
the UOV scheme.
Scenario 3 (Fixed Vinegar) This scenario assumes that the at-
tacker is able to fix part of randomly chosen vinegar variables from
(ùë•ùë£‚àíùë¢+1, . . . , ùë•ùë£), where ùë¢ is the number of vinegar variables fixed
out of total ùë£ vinegar variables during multiple signature compu-
tation sessions. After that, message/signature pairs are generated
and utilized to recover the secrets. ùëõ ‚àí ùë¢ + 1 pairs are needed to
recover part of T . As the attack recovers partial information about
T , it is applicable to both the UOV and Rainbow schemes but still
not sufficient to recover the secret key.
Shim et al. [40] have recently presented an algebraic fault analy-
sis attack on the UOV and Rainbow schemes. They have assumed a
similar scenario of fixed (reused) vinegar but they have two more
scenarios as well: revealed and set to zero vinegar. They are also
