## Introduction
- **Mission:** World domination via a single UDP packet
- **Privacy Concerns:** 
  - Do we care if our home toaster sees us naked?
  - Can home devices turn against us and spy on our network?
- **Issues Raised by Technology:**
  - New hardware and cool devices raise privacy and trust issues.

---

## Trust, Technology, and Privacy Issues
- **Common Privacy Issues:**
  - Technology is replacing traditional trust models.
  - People confuse human knowledge with machine knowledge.
  - Do we care if Google's machines know our preferences for adult content?
  - Can this information be given to humans?
- **Trust Models:**
  - We generally do not fully trust humans with sensitive information.
  - Should we trust corporations like Google?
  - Should we trust hardware and software vendors?

## Overview of Home Networking
- **Home Networking in Windows XP and Vista:**
  - Peer-to-peer networking of PCs, appliances, and wireless devices.
  - UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) architecture.
  - IPv6 and security exploits.
- **Windows Vista Enhancements:**
  - Network Explorer (replaces XP’s Network Neighborhood).
  - Function discovery using NetBios, UPnP/SSDP, and Web Services Discovery (WSD).
  - Windows Peer-to-Peer Networking, People Near Me (PNM), and media sharing.

---

## Universal Plug and Play (UPnP)
- **Architecture:**
  - A distributed, open networking architecture leveraging TCP/IP and the web.
  - Enables seamless proximity networking and control among networked devices.
- **Benefits:**
  - Media and device independence.
  - Platform independence.
  - Internet-based technologies (IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, XML).
  - UI and programmatic control.
  - Common base protocols.
  - Extendable with value-added services.

---

## UPnP, IGDs, and SSDP on XP
- **UPnP:**
  - Permits discovery and interoperability between various network devices.
  - By default, the UPnP client is not installed.
- **Internet Gateway Device (IGD):**
  - Permits detection and interaction with routers and devices running Internet Connection Sharing.
  - Uses Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) to broadcast availability.
  - By default, the IGD Discovery and Control Client is installed.

---

## Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)
- **Device and Service Descriptions:**
  - On default XP installations, no support is added for device control.
  - Microsoft added support for "InternetGatewayDevice" to aid network hardware manufacturers.

## Steps to Create a Crazy Toaster Trojan
- **Realization:**
  - SSDP and UPnP protocols allow seamless connectivity but also potential attacks.
  - A "Crazy Toaster" Trojan can join a local network and become a security hazard.
- **Recipe:**
  - **Ingredients:**
    - Toaster
    - Hardware: Any or none
    - Software: Select an UPnP stack vendor sample (e.g., Intel, Siemens)
    - Network access to the victim’s network
  - **Problems:**
    - Heat management
    - Linux to Nokia IPSO porting
    - Shipping logistics

---

## Trojan Discovery Process
- **Discovery:**
  - HTTPU (HTTP over UDP)
  - HTTPMU for UDP multicast to 239.255.255.250:1900
  - Social engineering: Declare as standard computing equipment, kitchen appliances, or home entertainment systems.
- **Presentation Web Server:**
  - JavaScript, Ajax, and browser bugs
  - Use known techniques and exploits (e.g., MPack)
  - Retrieve attack payload from a remote host

---

## Demonstration
- **Physical Run:**
  - "Crazy Toaster" Trojan attack
  - Advanced attack vectors: Discovery, presentation, social engineering, and browser exploits.
  - Hardware: Nokia IPSO 6
  - SDKs: Posix, Win

---

## Windows XP SSDP Distributed DoS
- **Side Effect:**
  - Single multicast UDP packet causes XP victims to parse a well-formatted XML document recursively.
  - Memory consumption and 100% CPU usage on the entire LAN segment.
  - Can be done via software (spyware, worm).
  - Distributed damage and possible attack vectors.
  - MS will fix this in Service Pack 3 for XP.

---

## Side Effect Demonstration
- **Kitchen Appliance in Smart Home:**
  - Physical run of Windows XP Simple Service Discovery Protocol Distributed Denial of Service vulnerability.
  - Logic bomb discovery in wired or wireless local networks.
  - Demo Kill XML.

---

## TODO and Extended Ideas
- ARP poisoning, kernel bugs
- Wireless hacking, WEP cracking
- Linux embedded systems, MIPS
- Cell phone hacking, GPS, iPhone
- Media centers, game consoles
- DivX worm, copyright bomb
- Record sound, IP hidden cam
- IPv6

---

## Conclusions
- **Key Points:**
  - Cheap hardware appliances can be exploited by "bad guys."
  - Wireless hardware and IPv6 introduce new vulnerabilities.
  - Trust no one (hardware and software vendors, free gifts).
  - Home devices can be targets for remote attacks (buffer overflows, CSRF, XSS).
  - Disable the SSDP Discovery Service and Universal Plug and Play Host service.
  - In Vista, disable 'Network discovery.'
  - Home devices are as bad as their software authors.
