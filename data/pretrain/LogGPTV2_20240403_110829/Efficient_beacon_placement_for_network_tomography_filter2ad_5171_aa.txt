ABSTRACT
Recent interest in using tomography for network monitoring has
raised the fundamental issue of whether it is possible to use only a
small number of probing nodes (beacons) for monitoring all edges
of a network in the presence of dynamic routing. Past work has
shown that minimizing the number of beacons is NP-hard, and has
provided approximate solutions that may be fairly suboptimal. In
this paper, we use a two-pronged approach to compute an efﬁcient
beacon set: (i) we formulate the need for, and design algorithms
for, computing the set of edges that can be monitored by a beacon
under all possible routing states; and (ii) we minimize the number
of beacons used to monitor all network edges. We show that the
latter problem is NP-complete and use an approximate placement
algorithm that yields beacon sets of sizes within 1 + ln(|E|) of the
optimal solution, where E is the set of edges to be monitored. Bea-
con set computations for several Rocketfuel ISP topologies indicate
that our algorithm may reduce the number of beacons yielded by
past solutions by more than 50%.

INTRODUCTION
The last two decades have witnessed an exponential growth of
the Internet in terms of its infrastructure, its trafﬁc load, as well as
its commercial usage. Today, the growth of the world’s economy
depends heavily on the connectivity, reliability, and quality of ser-
vice provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The ability to
monitor the health of their networks is essential for ISPs to provide

good service to customers. Consequently, there is signiﬁcant in-
terest in developing network monitoring infrastructures that allow
ISPs to monitor their network links.
A key consideration in the design of monitoring infrastructures
is to develop low-cost solutions. In particular, the idea of placing
and operating sophisticated monitors at all nodes in a network is
not cost-efﬁcient. Instead, there has been signiﬁcant recent interest
in relying on tomographic techniques that use only a few probing
nodes (beacons) for monitoring the health of all network links [1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A key challenge is to ﬁnd a small set of beacons
that is guaranteed to be able to monitor all network links, even with
dynamically-changing IP routes. Two recent efforts have focused
on the problem of ﬁnding the smallest beacon sets for a network [4,
7]. These, however, do not adequately meet the above challenge—
the beacon set of [4] is not robust to changes in IP routes, and the
beacon set proposed in [7] can be quite large for real ISP topologies
(Sections 2 and 5).
In this paper, we present beacon placement
strategies that meet both aspects of the above challenge.
Our approach relies on a two-pronged methodology. First, we
deﬁne the concept of a deterministically monitorable edge set (DMES)
of a beacon as the set of edges that can be monitored by the bea-
con under all possible route conﬁgurations. We present efﬁcient
graph-theoretic algorithms for computing the DMES of all candi-
date beacons for a given network. Second, we consider the problem
of ﬁnding the minimum number of beacons such that the union of
their DMES covers all network edges. We show that this is an NP-
complete problem. We then use an approximate solution that yields
beacon sets of sizes within 1 + ln(|E|) of the optimal solution,
where E is the set of network edges. Finally, we prove and exploit
additional properties of beacons that help in improving the compu-
tational efﬁciency of our algorithm. Our experimental results with
several real ISP topologies obtained from the Rocketfuel project [8]
illustrate that our beacon placement strategy yields beacon sets that
are 50 − 70% smaller than those yielded by [7].
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
formulate the problem of beacon placement and discuss past work.
In Section 3, we deﬁne and compute DMES. Section 4 discusses
beacon set minimization. Section 5 presents experimental results
with Rocketfuel topologies. We conclude in Section 6.
Notations and Assumptions. We model a network as an
undirected graph G(V, E), where V is the set of network nodes
and E is the set of links (or edges)—in [9], we extend our analysis
to directed graphs as well. We use the terms network and graph
interchangeably. We assume that G is connected (there exists a
path from any node to any other node) and that all routes are simple
(acyclic). Finally, we say that two physical paths between a pair of
nodes are distinct, if they differ in even one of the edges traversed.
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In a tomographic network monitoring infrastructure, each net-
work link is monitored by a special probing node, referred to as a
beacon.1 The basic idea behind most tomographic setups is fairly
simple: the beacon sends a pair of nearly-simultaneous probes to
the two end-nodes of the link, only one of which traverses the link.
Each end-point sends back a response to the beacon—this may be
implemented using ICMP echo messages. The results of the probes
can then be used to infer properties of the link. For instance, if the
objective is to measure link delays, then the difference in round-trip
times of the two probes can be used as an estimate. If the objec-
tive is to simply detect link transmission failures, the success and
failure of the two probes may be used as reasonable estimators.
Note that, in general, a beacon is capable of monitoring several
network links. A set of beacons that can be collectively used to
monitor all the links of a network is referred to as a beacon set. A
central issue in the design of a monitoring infrastructure is that of
beacon placement—which network nodes should be used to con-
struct a beacon set? Two requirements guide the design of a good
beacon placement strategy:
• Minimizing the number of beacons.
One of the prime motivations for using tomography for net-
work monitoring is to reduce the cost of the monitoring in-
frastructure. However, even a tomographic infrastructure in-
volves the development, installation, debugging, operation,
and maintenance of specialized software/hardware on each
beacon. In order to minimize the cost of doing so, it is im-
portant that the number of beacons used to monitor all links
of a given network are minimized.
• Robustness to routing dynamics.
Routing state in many networks responds to changes in trafﬁc
patterns and link loads, as well as to link failures. Since In-
ternet trafﬁc conditions are highly dynamic, the default IP
routes in a given network may change at relatively small
time-scales. A monitoring infrastructure, therefore, should
not assume a speciﬁc routing conﬁguration in order to as-
sign a beacon to a given link. More generally, a beacon set
should be able to monitor all network links, independent of
the current route conﬁguration.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of beacon placement
that meets the above requirements. Speciﬁcally, our objective is
to: minimize the number of beacons required to deterministically
monitor all the links of a given network, even in the presence of
dynamism in IP routes.
2.1 Past Work
A fundamental step in ﬁnding the smallest beacon set for a net-
work is to ﬁrst enlist the edges that can be monitored by each can-
didate beacon, referred to as the monitorable edge set (MES) of the
beacon. Note that the union of MES of all beacons in a beacon set
is equal to the set of all network edges. In general, the larger is the
average MES size in a beacon set, the smaller is the beacon set.2
1Some applications of tomography may require multiple beacons
to monitor a given link [10].
2Perhaps the largest MES (and smallest beacon set) that can be
envisioned is when a single beacon monitors all the links of a
network—this is feasible, for instance, in a network which sup-
ports source-routing [11].
In such a network, a beacon can pre-
cisely specify the path traversed by its probes, and hence can probe
the end-points of any network link. However, this strategy relies
on the availability of source-routing support at all network nodes,
which is the not the case with a majority of current networks [4].
Figure 1: Simple vs. Locally-ﬂexible Beacons
Below, we brieﬂy discuss two beacon placement schemes that have
been proposed in recent literature, which differ in their assumptions
about which links comprise the MES of a beacon.
• Simple Beacons:
In [4], the authors assume that the MES
of a beacon consists of all links that can be reached by the
beacon—which are links that lie on its IP routing tree.3 In
order to monitor a link in its MES, the beacon—henceforth
referred to as a “simple” beacon—sends probes to the end-
points of the link, along the default IP paths to those end-
points. The authors demonstrate that the problem of mini-
mizing the size of the beacon set with such beacons, is NP-
hard, and provide a placement strategy that produces a bea-
con set no larger than 1 + log|E| times the optimal beacon
set. Unfortunately, since the authors assume that all links
within the routing tree of a beacon belong to its MES, their
strategy is not robust to changes in routing trees and works
only for networks with static routes.
• Locally-ﬂexible Beacons:
In [7], the authors consider bea-
cons that have a greater ﬂexibility in selecting the paths taken
by the probes. Speciﬁcally, the beacons—henceforth referred
to as “locally-ﬂexible” beacons—are capable of selecting the
ﬁrst link (outgoing link from beacon) on which a probe to any
destination is transmitted. A probe can, therefore, be sent to
a destination either along the current IP route to the destina-
tion, or along one of the current IP route from any immediate
neighbor to the same destination (Figure 1).4 Furthermore,
the authors do not assume static routing state and deﬁne the
MES of a beacon to consist of links that, irrespective of what
current routes are, can always be monitored. The authors do
not provide a mechanism to compute such an MES for a bea-
con, but show that even if these sets are known, the beacon
set minimization problem is NP-hard. The authors instead
suggest an alternative beacon-placement strategy which, un-
fortunately, could result in fairly large beacon sets for current
network topologies (see Section 5).
To summarize, existing beacon placement strategies5 are either
not robust to routing dynamics or are inefﬁcient in minimizing the
3The IP routing tree of a node refers to the tree, rooted at the node,
which is formed by the links that lie on the default IP routes from
that node to each of the other nodes in the network.
4The authors in [7] implicitly assume that the default IP route from
any neighbor to the said destination will not go through the beacon
node. This assumption may get violated when a path through the
beacon has a smaller cost that any other physical path between a
neighbor and the destination.
