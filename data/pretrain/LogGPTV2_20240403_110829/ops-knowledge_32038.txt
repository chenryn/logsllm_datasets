Question: In the context of TCP/IP security, what are the potential consequences of an adversary being able to predict or guess the initial sequence numbers (ISNs) in TCP connections? Select all that apply.
"A": "An adversary could forge the IP source address to impersonate a host from a trusted list in services like rlogin.",
"B": "An adversary could hijack existing connections by injecting data, potentially taking over an authenticated session.",
"C": "An adversary could reduce the effectiveness of cryptographic protocols like ssl and ssh by predicting sequence numbers.",
"D": "An adversary could perform a denial of service attack by sending a reset (RST) packet with a guessed sequence number."
