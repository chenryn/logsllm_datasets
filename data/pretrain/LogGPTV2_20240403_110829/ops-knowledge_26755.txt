User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题new Apache DocumentRoot but sometimes serves the old I have a Wordpress site installed on Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu). PHP is Php-fpm, 7.2.

I would like to change DocumentRoot from /var/www/html/site1 to /var/www/html/site2 but when I do, and after I restarted apache I sometimes get the site from /var/www/html/site1 and sometimes from /var/www/html/site2 ?

I also restarted the php-fpm daemon.

How can this be?

Assistant: If you open a private/incognito session of your browser does the old version come up at all?

Are you sure there isn't any other Apache config file that's getting picked up?
Though I think that might result in a conflict anyway if there were.

Do the Apache logs on the server show that it's sometimes directing queries to the old folder?
