  * OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Windows10 64bit
  * Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device:
  * TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
  * TensorFlow version (use command below): 1.12, 1.11
  * Python version:3.6.8
  * Bazel version (if compiling from source):

  * CUDA/cuDNN version:7.4.2, 7.3.1
  * GPU model and memory: CUDA 9.0
**Describe the current behavior**  
I have installed TF using pip, I have tested and it was able to detect the
GPU, but when start to train, it throws the error below:
> UnknownError (see above for traceback): Failed to get convolution algorithm.
> This is probably because cuDNN failed to initialize, so try looking to see

**Note**  
I have tried TF 1.12, 1.11, and 1.8.0 all have the same problem.  
Why it throwing this error and how to solve?
Before this error, I was able to train, and it was successfully worked, but
when to start the second time training then this error happens.
