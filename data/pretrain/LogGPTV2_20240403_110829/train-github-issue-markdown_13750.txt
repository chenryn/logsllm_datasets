While running density tests against a kubernetes cluster, we will occasionally
run into nodes where the docker daemon becomes unresponsive. Symptoms include:
  * `docker ps` hangs
  * `kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for veth0123456 to become free. Usage count = 1` appears in journal output
Probably an upstream issue. But I would expect kubelet to notice that its
docker deamon is unhealthy and send a 'NotReady' status back up to the
controller manager. Instead, it stays at 'Ready' and the scheduler assigns
pods to it, which will stay stuck in Pending.
This is not quite the same as #16601 but our mitigation is the same, we're
forced to reboot the node.
