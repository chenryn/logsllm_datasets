Hi! While installing `jaxlib` from sources on macos 11.2.2. by following docs
the installation fails with `ld: 2 duplicate symbols` error that points to
output in `bazel-out/`. The log below is taken from rerunning `python3
build/build.py` (fails with same error). Thank you for any tips what I can be
missing!
Following the `install from sources instructions`:
  1. `git clone https://github.com/google/jax; cd jax`
  2. running installation (without cuda): `python3 build/build.py`
    $ python3 build/build.py
