Hello,

I encountered an issue while attempting to install `jaxlib` from source on macOS 11.2.2, following the official documentation. The installation process fails with an `ld: 2 duplicate symbols` error, which points to output in the `bazel-out/` directory.

Below is the log from re-running the `python3 build/build.py` command, which results in the same error. I would greatly appreciate any tips or suggestions on what might be causing this issue.

### Steps Followed (as per the "Install from Sources" instructions):

1. Cloned the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/google/jax
   cd jax
   ```

2. Attempted to run the installation without CUDA support:
   ```sh
   python3 build/build.py
   ```

Thank you for your assistance!
