User: How to use Ansible to automate server management and configuration, and deploy applications in batches?
Assistant: The steps to use Ansible to automate server management and configuration, and deploy applications in batches are as follows: 1. Install Ansible First, you need to install Ansible on the control node (work computer). Ansible supports Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems. 2. Set up Ansible's inventory file. Add the target host (hosted server) to the inventory file. The inventory file can be in INI, YAML, or JSON format, and can also be customized as needed. 3. Create a playbook A playbook is a script that uses Ansible to perform operations, and consists of a series of tasks (Task). Each task is based on a module (Module), which refers to some functions defined in Ansible, such as installing software packages, copying files, modifying configuration files, and so on. 4. Run the playbook When executing the playbook, Ansible will automatically run the task on the target host, which can be run in the command line or in Ansible Tower. 5. Deploy applications in batches After packaging the applications into executable files, use the commands in the playbook to copy the programs to all target hosts and configure the necessary environment variables. After the deployment is complete, Ansible can be used to monitor the running status of the application so that running problems can be dealt with in a timely manner. In short, using Ansible can achieve simple, efficient, and repeatable automation tasks, and can easily expand the scale of the management server, reduce maintenance costs, and improve efficiency.
