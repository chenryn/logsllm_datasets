### 4.2 Individual Session Performance

A fundamental performance metric for BitTorrent is the average download rate of leechers. Over the five-month period covered by the tracker log, we observed an average download rate consistently above 500 kb/s. This impressive figure indicates that most BitTorrent clients have good connectivity (at least ADSL), which is not surprising given the total size of the file. Moreover, BitTorrent exhibits good scalability: during the initial flash-crowd, the average download rate was close to 600 kb/s, and the aggregate download rate of all simultaneously active clients was more than 800 Mb/s.

BitTorrent is thus able to capitalize on the bandwidth of end-system hosts to achieve a very high aggregate throughput. However, the final objective of BitTorrent is to replicate a given content across all peers in a torrent. Therefore, it is essential to determine how many peers eventually completed the download and the fraction of bytes downloaded by those who did not complete the transfer. Since BitTorrent allows users to suspend and resume downloads at any time, a peer might complete the download after one or several sessions.

In the tracker log, a session ID (a hash of the IP address of the host and its current time) identifies each session, along with the IP address of the host as seen by the tracker. Identifying single-session downloads is straightforward based on the session ID. To reconstruct multi-session downloads, we assumed that the IP address of the host does not change from one session to another. NATs often use port numbers to disambiguate connections rather than IP addresses, so our assumption can hold even in this case. If two or more hosts behind a firewall simultaneously participate in the same torrent, it might be difficult to disambiguate them.

Since a peer provides the amount of bytes it has downloaded in each report (sent every 30 minutes), we matched two sessions with the same IP if the amount of bytes in the last report of the first session is close to the amount of bytes in the first report of the second session. These values are not necessarily the same if the user improperly disconnects the BitTorrent client, resulting in the latter not sending its disconnection report with the current amount of bytes downloaded. A set of sessions forms a multi-session download if the file download is completed during the last session (on average, we found that a multi-session download consists of 3.9 sessions). We also observed some sessions that started with 100% of the file already downloaded. This occurs if the user rejoins the torrent after completing the download to act as a seed. We categorized the sessions into four types: single-session downloads, multi-session downloads, seed sessions, and incomplete downloads. Table 1 provides statistics for these sessions.

**Table 1. Sessions Types and Their Characteristics**

| Type                      | Number of Sessions | Total Download (TB) | Total Upload (TB) | Download Rate (MB/s) | Upload Rate (MB/s) | Duration (hours) |
|---------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Single-session Downloads  | 20,584             | 34.7                | 28.5              | 1,765.7              | 1,450.2            | 8.1              |
| Multi-session Downloads   | 14,285             | 319.2               | 390.6             | 145.0                | -                  | 19.2             |
| Incomplete Downloads      | 138,423            | 6.2                 | 50.5              | 11.2                 | 69.1               | -                |
| Seed Sessions             | 8,555              | 114.7               | -                 | -                    | 223.6              | -                |
| **Total**                 | **181,847**        | **-**               | **-**             | **-**                | **-**              | **-**            |

Overall, Table 1 indicates that only 19% of the sessions are part of a transfer that eventually completed. However, the 81% of sessions that did not complete the transfer represent only 21.5% of the total amount of downloaded bytes. Moreover, the incomplete sessions uploaded almost as many bytes as they downloaded. It is challenging to determine the reasons behind the abortion of a transfer. It might be because the user decides they are not interested in the file or due to poor download performance. To investigate this issue, we looked at the statistics (durations and volumes) for sessions that start with 0% of the file during the first five days. We classified these sessions into two categories: "completed" and "non-completed." The "completed" category corresponds to the single-session downloads defined previously, while the "non-completed" category corresponds to transfers that never complete or the first session of transfers that will eventually complete.

- **(b) Download Volume**

From Figure 4, we can observe that 90% of the non-completed sessions remain in the torrent for less than 10,000 seconds (and 60% for less than 1,000 seconds) and retrieve less than 10% of the file. Most non-completed sessions are short and involve little data download.

Let us now focus on the performance achieved by single-session downloads. The average download rate of these 20,584 sessions is close to 1.3 Mb/s over the entire trace, which is higher than the download rate averaged over all sessions (500 kb/s). The average download time for single-session downloads is about 29,000 seconds overall. Such values reveal a high variability in the download rates achieved by these sessions, as if they had all achieved a download rate of 1.3 Mb/s, the average download time would be approximately 10,000 seconds. This is confirmed by the distribution of these download throughputs (see Figure 5(a)), which clearly shows a peak around 400 kb/s (a typical value for ADSL lines), significantly lower than the mean.

### 4.3 Geographical Analysis

The tracker log provides the IP addresses of the clients. Based on these addresses, we used NetGeo (http://www.caida.org/tools/utilities/netgeo/) to estimate the origin country of the peers that participated in the torrent. The estimation might be imprecise as NetGeo is no longer maintained. Overall, we were unable to obtain information for around 10% of the hosts. Table 2 indicates the top five countries for the first five days, the first four weeks, and the complete trace. We can observe that this set of countries, as well as the ranking, is consistently the same for all three time scales. Most of the clients are from the US, while Europe is represented only through the Netherlands. For the Netherlands, 50% of the hosts originate from ripe.net (an information service provider).

**Table 2. Top Five Countries for Different Time Periods**

| Time Period       | Top 5 Countries     |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| First 5 Days      | US, NL, ...         |
| First 4 Weeks     | US, NL, ...         |
| Complete Trace    | US, NL, ...         |
