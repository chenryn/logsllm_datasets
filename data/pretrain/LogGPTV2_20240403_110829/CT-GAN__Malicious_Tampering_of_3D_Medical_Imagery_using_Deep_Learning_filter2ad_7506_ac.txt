PACS Server. The heart of the PACS system. It is responsible
for storing, organizing, and retrieving DICOM imagery and
reports commonly via SQL. Although the most facilities
use local servers, a few hospitals have transitioned to cloud
storage [39].
RIS Server. The radiology information system (RIS) is re-
sponsible for managing medical imagery and associated data.
Its primary use is for tracking radiology imaging orders and
the reports of the radiologists. Doctors in the hospital’s inter-
nal network can interface with the RIS to order scans, receive
the resulting reports, and to obtain the DICOM scans [40].
Modality Workstation. A PC (typically Windows) which
is used to control an imaging modality such as a CT
scanner. During an appointment, the attending technician
conﬁgures and captures the imagery via the workstation.
The workstation sends all imagery in DICOM format to the
PACS server for storage.
Radiologist Workstation. A radiologist can retrieve and
view scans stored on the PACS server from various locations.
The most common location is a viewing workstation within
the department. Other locations include the radiologist’s
personal PC (local or remote via VPN), and sometimes a
mobile device (via the Internet or within the local network).
7A CT scan can have a resolution from 512x512x600 to 1024x1024x600
and larger.
Web Server. An optional feature which enables radiologists
to view of DICOM scans (in the PACS server) over the
Internet. The content may be viewed though a web browser
(e.g., medDream and Orthanc [41]), an app on a mobile
device (e.g., FujiFilm’s Synapse Mobility), or accessed via
a web API (e.g., Dicoogle [42]).
Administrative Assistant’s PC. This workstation has both
Internet access (e.g., for emails) and access to the PACS net-
work. Access to the PACS is enabled so that the assistant can
maintain the devices’ schedules: When a patient arrives at
the imaging modality, for safety reasons, the technician con-
ﬁrms the patient’s identity with the details sent to the modal-
ity’s workstation (entered by the assistant). This ensures that
the scans are not accidentally mixed up between the patients.
Hospital Network. Other departments within the hospital
usually have access to the PACS network. For example,
Oncology, Cardiology, Pathology, and OR/Surgery. In these
cases, various workstations around the hospital can load
DICOM ﬁles from the server given the right credentials.
Furthermore, it is common for a hospital to deploy Wi-Fi
access points, which are connected to the internal network,
for employee access.
4.2 Attack Scenario
The attack scenario is as follows: An attacker wants to achieve
one of the goals listed in Table 1 by injecting/removing medical
evidence. In order to cause the target effect, the attacker will
alter the contents of the target’s CT scan(s) before the radiol-
ogist performs his or her diagnosis. The attacker will achieve
this by either targeting the data-at-rest or data-in-motion.
Thedata-at-rest refers to the DICOM ﬁles stored on the
PACS Server, or on the radiologist’s personal computer (saved
for later viewing). In some cases, DICOM ﬁles are stored on
DVDs and then transferred to the hospital by the patient or
an external doctor. Although the DVD may be swapped by
the attacker, it is more likely the interaction will be via the
network. The data-in-motion refers to DICOM ﬁles being
transferred across the network or loaded into volatile memory
by an application (e.g., a DICOM viewer).
We note that this scenario does not apply to the case where
the goal is to falsify or sabotage research. Moreover, for
insurance fraud, an attacker will have a much easier time
targeting a small medical clinic. For simplicity, we will assume
that the target PACS is in a hospital.
4.3 Target Assets
To capture/modify a medical scan, an attacker must compro-
mise at least one of the assets numbered in Fig. 3. By compro-
mising one of (1-4), the attacker gains access to every scan. By
compromising (5) or (6), the attacker only gains access to a sub-
set of scans. The RIS (3) can give the attacker full control over
the PACS server (2), but only if the attacker can obtain the right

credentials or exploit the RIS software. The network wiring be-
tween the modalities and the PACS server (4) can be used to in-
stall a man-in-the-middle device. This device can modify data-
in-motion if it is not encrypted (or if the protocol is ﬂawed).
In all cases, it is likely that the attacker will infect the
target asset with a custom malware, outlined in Fig. 4. This
is because there may not be a direct route to the PACS via the
Internet or because the diagnosis may take place immediately
after the scan is taken.
4.4 Attack Vectors
There are many ways in which an attacker can reach the assets
marked in Fig. 3. In general, the attack vectors involve either
remote or local inﬁltration of the facility’s network.
Remote Inﬁltration. The attacker may be able to exploit
vulnerabilities in elements facing the Internet, providing the
attacker with direct access to the PACS from the Internet
(e.g., [8]). Another vector is to perform a social engineering at-
tack. For example, a spear phishing attack on the department’s
administrative assistant to infect his/her workstation with a
backdoor, or a phishing attack on the technician to have him
install fraudulent updates.
If the PACS is not directly connected to the Internet, an alter-
native vector is to (1) inﬁltrate the hospital’s internal network
and then (2) perform lateral movement to the PACS. This is
possible because PACS is usually connected to the internal
network (using static routes and IPs), and the internal network
is connected to the Internet (evident from the recent wave of
cyber-attacks on medical facilities [3, 43–45]). The bridge be-
tween the internal network and the PACS is to enable doctors to
view scans/reports and to enable the administrative assistant to
manage patient referrals [9]. Another vector from the Internet is
to compromise a remote site (e.g., a partnered hospital or clinic)
which is linked to the hospital’s internal network. Furthermore,
the attacker may also try to infect a doctor’s laptop or phone
with a malware which will open a back door into the hospital.
If the attacker knows that radiologist analyzes scans on his
or her personal computer, then the attacker can infect the radi-
ologist’s device or DICOM viewer remotely with the malware.
Local Inﬁltration. The attacker can gain physical access to
the premises with a false pretext, such as being a technician
from Philips who needs to run a diagnostic on the CT scanner.
The attacker may also hire an insider or even be an insider. A
recent report shows that 56% of cyber attacks on the healthcare
industry come from internal threats [10].
Once inside, the attacker can plant the malware or a back
door by (1) connecting a device to exposed network infrastruc-
ture (ports, wires, ...) [46] or (2) by accessing an unlocked work-
station. Another vector which does not involve access to a re-
stricted area, is to access to the internal network by hacking Wi-
Fi access points. This can be accomplished using existing vul-
nerabilities such as ’Krack’ [47] or the more recent ‘Bleeding-
Bit’ vulnerabilities which have affected many hospitals [48].
Compromising the PACS. Once access to the PACS has
been achieved, there are numerous ways an attacker can
compromise a target asset. Aside from exploiting misconﬁg-
urations or default credentials, the attacker can exploit known
software vulnerabilities. With regards to PACS servers, some
already disclose private information/credentials which can
be exploited remotely to create of admin accounts, and have
hard-coded credentials.8 A quick search on exploit-db.com
reveals seven implemented exploits for PACS servers in 2018
alone. With regards to modality workstations, they too have
been found to have signiﬁcant vulnerabilities [49]. In 2018

medical dummy (Fig. 5). We found that the scan of the dummy
was sent over the network twice: once in cleartext over TCP to
an internal web viewing service, and again to the PACS storage
server using TLSv1.2. However, to our surprise, the payload of
the TLS transmission was also in cleartext. Moreover, within
10 minutes, we obtained the usernames and passwords of over
27 staff members and doctors due to multicasted Ethernet
trafﬁc containing HTTP POST messages sent in cleartext. A
video of the pen-test can be found online.11
These vulnerabilities were disclosed to the hospital’s IT staff
and to their PACS software provider. Though inquiry, we found
that it is not common practice for hospitals to encrypt their
internal PACs trafﬁc [52]. One reason is compatibility: hos-
pitals often have old components (scanners, portals, databases,
...) which do not support encryption. Another reason is some
PACS are not directly connected to the Internet, and thus is
it erroneously thought that there is no need for encryption.
5 The CT-GAN Framework
In this section, we present the technique which an attacker
can use to add/remove evidence in CT scans. First, we present
the CT-GAN architecture and how to train it. Then, we will
describe the entire tampering process and present some sample
results. As a case study, we will focus on injecting/removing
lung cancer.
It is important to note that there are many types of lung
cancer. A common type of cancer forms a round mass of
tissue called a solitary pulmonary nodule. Most nodules with
a diameter less than 8mm are benign. However, nodules which
are larger may indicate a malign cancerous growth. Moreover,
if numerous nodules having a diameter >8mm are found, then
the patient has an increased risk of primary cancer [53]. For
this attack, we will focus on injecting and removing multiple
solitary pulmonary nodules.
5.1 The Neural Architecture
A single slice in a CT scan has a resolution of at least 512x512
pixels. Each pixel in a slice measures the radiodensity at that
location in Hounsﬁeld units (HU). The CT scan of a human’s
lungs can have over 157 million voxels12 (512x512x600). In
order to train a GAN on an image of this size, we ﬁrst locate
a candidate location (voxel) and then cut out a small region
around it (cuboid) for processing. The selected region is
slightly larger than needed in order to provide the cGAN with
context of the surrounding anatomy. This enables the cGAN
to generate/remove lung cancers which connect to the body
in a realistic manner.
To accurately capture the concepts of injection and removal,
we use a framework consisting of two cGANs: one for inject-
ing cancer (GANinj) and one for removing cancer (GANrem).
Both GANinj and GANrem are deep 3D convolutional cGANs
Figure 5: Left: The CT scanner and the medical dummy used
to validate the attack. Top-right: the Pi-bridge used to intercept
the scans. Bottom-right: one of the dummy’s slices, sent by
the CT scanner, and intercepted by the Pi-bridge.
the US Department of Homeland Security exposed ‘low skill’
vulnerabilities in Philips’ Brilliance CT scanners [50]. For
example, improper authentication, OS command injection,
and hard-coded credentials.9 Other recent vulnerabilities
include hard-coded credentials.10
Given the state of health-care security, and that systems
such as CT scanners are rarely given software updates [51],
it is likely that these vulnerabilities and many more exist.
Once the target asset in the PACS has been compromised, the
attacker will be able to install the malware and manipulate the
scans of target patients.
4.5 Attack Demonstration
To demonstrate how an attacker can access and manipulate CT
scans, we performed a penetration test on a hospital’s radiology
department. The pen-test was performed with full permission
of the participating hospital. To gain access to all CT scans,
we performed a man-in-the-middle attack on the CT scanner
using a Raspberry Pi 3B. The Pi was given a USB-to-Ethernet
adapter, and was conﬁgured as a passive network bridge
(without network identiﬁers). The Pi was also conﬁgured as a
hidden Wi-Fi access point for backdoor access. We also printed
a 3D logo of the CT scanner’s manufacturer and glued it to the
Pi to make it less conspicuous. The pen-test was performed as
follows: First we waited at night until the cleaning staff opened
the doors. Then we found the CT scanner’s room and installed
the Pi-bridge between the scanner’s workstation and the PACs
network (location #2 in Fig. 3). Finally, we hid the Pi-bridge un-
der an access panel in the ﬂoor. The entire installation process
took 30 seconds to complete. We were able to connect to the Pi
wirelessly from the waiting room (approximately 20m away)
to monitor the device’s status, change the target identiﬁer, etc.
At this point, an attacker could either intercept scans
directly or perform lateral movement through the PACS to
other subsystems and install the malware there. To verify that

we have omitted this ‘feature’ from the above model.
5.2 Training CT-GAN
To train the GANs, we used a free dataset of 888 CT scans
collected in the LIDC-IDRI lung cancer screening trial [54].
The dataset came with annotations from radiologists: the
locations and diameters of pulmonary nodules having
diameters greater than 3mm. In total there were 1186 nodules
listed in the annotations.
To create the training set for GANinj, we extracted from
the CT scans all nodules with a diameter between 10mm
and 16mm (169 in total). To increase the number of training
samples, we performed data augmentation: For each of the 169
cuboid samples, we (1) ﬂipped the cuboid on the x, y, and xy
