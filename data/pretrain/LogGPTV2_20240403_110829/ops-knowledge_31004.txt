User: I am writing a daemon program using python 2.5.  In the main process an exit handler is registered with atexit module, it seems that the handler gets called  when each child process ends, which is not I expected.
I noticed this behavior isn't mentioned in python atexit doc, anybody knows the issue? If this is how it should behave, how can I unregister the exit handler in children processes? There is a atexit.unregister in version 3.0, but I am using 2.5.
Assistant: When you fork to make a child process, that child is an exact copy of the parent -- including of course registered exit functions as well as all other code and data structures. I believe that's the issue you're observing -- of course it's not mentioned in each and every module, because it necessarily applies to every single one.
