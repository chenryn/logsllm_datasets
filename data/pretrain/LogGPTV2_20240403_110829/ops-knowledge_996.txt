User: I am trying to run the Invensense motion_driver_6.12. I compiled the code with IAR and the STM32 works ok - all the test I've done with the board are ok: UART, I2C.. etc. But when I run the python client demo program "eMPL-client-py" the program shows only one empty black window and nothing occurs. I tried to run first the program and then switch on the board and vice-versa.
Thanks
Assistant: which type of Invensense chip you are using?

I think you need to check if you use the right COM Port in windows.
Check if you could get data from your MPUxxxx Board through I2C
Check log_stm32.c if this function work well fputc(out[i]);
