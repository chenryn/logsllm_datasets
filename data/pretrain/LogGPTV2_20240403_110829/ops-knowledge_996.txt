I am currently attempting to run the Invensense motion_driver_6.12. I have successfully compiled the code using IAR, and the STM32 board functions correctly in all tests I have conducted, including UART and I2C.

However, when I run the Python client demo program "eMPL-client-py," only an empty black window appears, and no further activity occurs. I have tried both starting the program first and then powering on the board, as well as powering on the board first and then running the program, but the issue persists.

Could you please specify which Invensense chip you are using?

Additionally, here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:
1. Verify that you are using the correct COM port in Windows.
2. Check if you can receive data from your MPUxxxx board via I2C.
3. Review the `log_stm32.c` file to ensure that the `fputc(out[i])` function is working correctly.

Thank you for your assistance.
