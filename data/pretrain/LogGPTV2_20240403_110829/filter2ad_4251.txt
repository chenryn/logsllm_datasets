The DETER Testbed: Overview 
25 August 2004 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The DETER (Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research testbed is a computer 
facility to support experiments in a broad range of cyber-security research projects, 
including those experiments that involve "risky" code. 
Note: The name "DETER" is a play on words; please, always stress the second 
syllable! 
The DETER testbed is designed to provide an experimental environment in which 
government, academic, and industry cyber-security researchers can safely analyze and 
measure attacks and develop attack mitigation and confinement strategies.  In addition, 
the DETER project will provide tools and resources to enable repeatable experiment 
methodologies, allowing different researchers to duplicate and analyze the same 
experiments. 
This note provides a brief overview of the capabilities, architecture, and usage of the 
DETER testbed. 
2. BACKGROUND 
Development and operation of the DETER testbed is being performed by the DETER 
project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of 
Homeland Security (DHS).  Participating organizations are USC/ISI, UC Berkeley, and 
McAfee Research (formerly NAI). 
DETER is constructed using the cluster testbed technology developed by the University 
of Utah and known as "Emulab" – see http://www.emulab.net/. Much of the online 
documentation for DETER is taken from Emulab, since much of the control and 
administrative software is the same.  However, there are some differences between 
DETER and Emulab, primarily to assure greater safety for malevolent code in DETER.  
For example, a DETER experiment does not have a direct IP path to the Internet, unlike 
an Emulab experiment.  
There will be no charge for the use of the DETER testbed.  Acceptable use policies are 
approved by the sponsoring agencies 
The DETER testbed is targeted, at least initially, at support for open and publishable 
research projects, typically academic research.  It does not currently have the kinds of 
privacy protection that might be required for use in testing vendor products, for example.  
We believe that the testbed technology that is being developed in DETER could easily be 
cloned and extended to support a product testing laboratory. 
An initial version of the DETER testbed has been in operation since March 2004.  
DETER has been used by three research teams under another NSF/DHS-sponsored 
project, EMIST (Evaluation Methods for Internet Security Technology).  EMIST teams 
performed experiments on DDoS attacks, worm propagation, and BGP attacks using the 
initial testbed. 
During the first 116 days of availability of the initial DETER cluster, a total of 28 
users had run 3284 experimental sessions ("swap ins") on DETER, using an 
aggregate total of 26,062 experimental nodes over 723 experiment days. 
We plan to gradually extend access to the testbed beyond the EMIST project teams to a 
broader community of academic, government, and industrial researchers. 
3. OVERVIEW OF THE TESTBED FACILITY 
The DETER testbed is constructed using the cluster testbed technology developed by the 
University of Utah and known as "Emulab" (see http://www.emulab.net/).  A cluster is a 
set of experimental nodes in a single room, interconnected through a programmable 
"backplane" or “patch panel”, which can dynamically establish a distinct network 
topology for each experiment.  In the DETER testbed, each node is a PC machine with 
significant disk storage, at least 2MB of memory, and four 10/100/1000bT Ethernet 
interfaces to the programmable patch panel. 
Under the control of an experimental script, the Emulab control software automatically 
allocates a set of free nodes and sets up the interconnections to allow a particular 
experiment to proceed.  The control software automatically loads kernels and other 
software into the nodes and configures the VLAN switch, firewalls, NFS mount points, 
and other system parameters to isolate it from any other experiments that may be running 
simultaneously.  Control of the PCs is then turned over to the experimenter. 
The Emulab control software used by DETER supports space-sharing on a node-level 
granularity (i.e., an individual node is the smallest unit of allocation), and experiments 
can be swapped out for large-grain time-sharing (i.e., after an experiment completes, it 
can be swapped out and back in at a later time). 
During the experiment, the user can employ the control plane to monitor the nodes, to 
reload crashed nodes, or to swap out the entire experiment, using a web GUI on the Boss 
server (see Figure 1). When all else fails, the user can deliberately power-cycle a node. 
The user has access to nodes through their serial consoles, and through their control ports 
via the User server. On the other hand, a running experiment in DETER will not have 
direct IP connectivity to the Internet outside their testbed.  It is also important to note that 
experimenters are not able to change the configuration of the VLAN switch while the 
experiment runs.

Figure 1: Schematic of DETER Testbed 
Figure 1 shows a schematic of the DETER testbed. This diagram omits the detailed 
configuration of the DETER control plane, since this should not be relevant to most 
users. The functional paths are shown as dotted lines. 
The DETER testbed includes two clusters, one at USC ISI (ISI) and one at UC Berkeley 
(UCB).  Within each cluster, there are one or more sets of identical nodes. The script for 
an experiment may ask for allocation of nodes from any single set or from a selection of 
these sets of nodes. The ISI/UCB link is high speed and should be largely, but not 
entirely, free of interference from other experiments or other Internet traffic. On the other 
hand, nodes from within a given set are always locally connected to the same 
programmable backplane switch, whose very high aggregate bandwidth should guarantee 
no interference. 
The N nodes and the VLAN switch that are shown in Fig. 1 are physically split between 
the ISI and the UCB clusters.  Except for the performance variation imposed by the 
ISI/UCB link, the different physical location should be transparent to DETER users. ISI 
is the primary entry point for users in every case. The VLAN switch and the Control 
Network VLAN are bridged between the two sites, using IPsec for security. 
3.1 Experimental Nodes 
At present the experimental nodes in the DETER testbed are all PC machines, with a high 
degree of homogeneity.  There are plans to add a few commercial routers to the testbed 
during the coming year. 
The nodes fall into three homogeneous pools of identical PC hardware configurations.  
The machines used in a particular experiment can be allocated from a particular pool or 
from a combination of pools, as specified by the experimenter. 
Each PC node in an experiment may run FreeBSD, Linux, or a (nearly-) arbitrary OS of 
the experimenter's choice.  As in Emulab, the experimenter may have root access to each 
assigned node.  PCs in a configuration can be configured as routers, as end systems, as 
traffic generators, or as traffic policers (e.g., using the 'dummynet' mechanism) to 
emulate arbitrary link characteristics. 
The DETER testbed includes two clusters of nodes.  There is an operational cluster of 72 
nodes at ISI.  A second cluster of 32 nodes at UC Berkeley is expected to be operational 
August. 
There are currently three pools of nodes in DETER: 
•  64 IBM Netfinity 4500R (Dual Pentium III 733MHz CPUs with 1GB RAM and 
17GB SCSI disk storage), at USC/ISI. 
•  8 Sun Microsystems Sun Fire V65X nodes (dual Pentium 2.8 Ghz Xeon CPUs 
with 2GB RAM and 216GB disk storage) nodes, at USC/ISI. 
•  32 Sun Microsystems Sun Fire v60x (dual Pentium 3.06 Ghz CPUs with 2GB 
RAM and 72GB disk storage) nodes, at UC Berkeley (to become operational in 
October 2004). 
3.2 Inter-node Links 
Network connections between experimental nodes are created by a "programmable 
backplane" consisting of a large, high-speed Ethernet switch.  Each experimental node 
has four 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet ports connected to the local high-speed Ethernet 
switch using VLANs. VLANs are used to create the desired experimental topology for 
each concurrent experiment. 
In addition to the four backplane ports, each node has a fifth port, of at least 100Mbs, for 
downloading and controlling the experiment.  The experimenter is also given access to 
remote power-cycling control and to the serial console interface of each node.  However, 
remote access to a running experiment may be limited or even disallowed if the 
experiment poses a risk of spreading outside the designated experimental nodes. 
Different Ethernet switch hardware is used at each of the ISI and UCB sites.  
Specifically, the ISI cluster uses a Cisco 6509 switch, while the UCB cluster uses a 
Foundry Fast Iron 1500 switch. Locally, each switch is sufficiently over-provisioned to 
avoid any interference between different inter-node logical links.  Thus, the nodes within 
a single site are interconnected over high-speed LAN connections whose performance is 
constant and repeatable.  On the other hand, the ISI and Berkeley pools are 
interconnected over high-speed Internet links whose performance is necessarily 
somewhat variable. An experiment can deliberately incorporate, allow but ignore, or 
avoid this inter-node variability by choosing which pool(s) to use for allocating nodes. 
3.3 Future Plans 
There are plans to extend the DETER facility significantly during the funding year 
beginning in October 2004.  Current funding will support the addition of roughly 60 
experimental nodes, in the near future.  Other improvements are expected to involve (1) 
addition of (a few) commercial routers, (2) control software to support experiments using 
risky code, and (3) monitors to detect security or containment breaches. 
4. Experiment Access 
To define and set up an experiment on the DETER testbed, a user (i.e., an experimenter) 
defines a configuration using a scripting language that is derived from the "ns" simulation 
language.  In accordance with this script, the testbed control plane allocates nodes, loads 
the specified disk images, and starts the experiment. 
Each user is given an account on a DETER server machine called "Users" (or “Ops”).  
This account may be used for staging input to an experiment and output from it, as well 
as experiment-related processing.  Each experiment has its own file system that can be 
mounted from the user's experimental nodes. 
The Boss server (Figure 1) runs the web GUI for deterlab.net, used for registering users 
and projects and for initiating and controlling experiments.  Each registered user has an 
account of the Users machine, and the file system under that account can be NFS-
mounted from experimental nodes. 
A user does not have direct IP connectivity to an experimental node, but the user will be 
able to SSH from his/her account on the "Users" machine into any of the allocated 
experimental nodes.  The user can also communicate with the experiment through shared 
files on the user's file system on the User node. If the node OS crashes, the user can 
reload the OS using the web interface.  OS reload includes power cycling the node.  The 
user can also employ serial console access to each node when severe containment 
requirements preclude even SSH or NFS access, so that the experiment must be run in an 
isolated manner. 
Experimental GUIs specifically designed for defining, controlling, and analyzing major 
classes of security experiments on DETER are under development by the EMIST project.
