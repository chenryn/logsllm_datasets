## The DETER Testbed: Overview
**Date:** 25 August 2004

### 1. Introduction
The DETER (Cyber Defense Technology Experimental Research) testbed is a specialized computing facility designed to support a wide range of cybersecurity research projects, including those involving potentially "risky" code. The name "DETER" is a play on words; please stress the second syllable.

The DETER testbed provides a controlled environment where government, academic, and industry researchers can safely analyze and measure cyber-attacks, and develop mitigation and containment strategies. Additionally, the DETER project offers tools and resources to facilitate repeatable experiment methodologies, enabling different researchers to duplicate and analyze the same experiments.

This document provides a brief overview of the DETER testbed's capabilities, architecture, and usage.

### 2. Background
The development and operation of the DETER testbed are funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Participating organizations include the University of Southern California/Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI), the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and McAfee Research (formerly NAI).

The DETER testbed is built using the cluster testbed technology developed by the University of Utah, known as "Emulab" (see http://www.emulab.net/). Much of the online documentation for DETER is derived from Emulab, as the control and administrative software is similar. However, DETER includes additional safety measures, such as isolating experiments from direct IP access to the Internet, to handle malevolent code more securely.

There is no charge for using the DETER testbed, and acceptable use policies are approved by the sponsoring agencies. Initially, the testbed is targeted at supporting open and publishable research projects, typically academic research. It does not currently provide the privacy protections required for testing vendor products, but the technology could be extended to support such applications.

An initial version of the DETER testbed has been operational since March 2004. It has been used by three research teams under the NSF/DHS-sponsored EMIST (Evaluation Methods for Internet Security Technology) project to conduct experiments on DDoS attacks, worm propagation, and BGP attacks. During the first 116 days of operation, 28 users ran 3,284 experimental sessions, using a total of 26,062 experimental nodes over 723 experiment days.

We plan to gradually expand access to the testbed beyond the EMIST project teams to a broader community of academic, government, and industrial researchers.

### 3. Overview of the Testbed Facility
The DETER testbed is constructed using the Emulab cluster testbed technology. A cluster consists of a set of experimental nodes in a single room, interconnected through a programmable backplane or patch panel, which can dynamically establish distinct network topologies for each experiment. Each node in the DETER testbed is a PC with significant disk storage, at least 2MB of memory, and four 10/100/1000bT Ethernet interfaces connected to the programmable patch panel.

Under the control of an experimental script, the Emulab control software automatically allocates free nodes and sets up the interconnections for the experiment. The control software loads kernels and other software into the nodes, configures the VLAN switch, firewalls, NFS mount points, and other system parameters to isolate the experiment from others running simultaneously. Control of the PCs is then turned over to the experimenter.

The Emulab control software supports space-sharing at the node level and allows for large-grain time-sharing. During the experiment, the user can monitor the nodes, reload crashed nodes, or swap out the entire experiment using a web GUI on the Boss server (see Figure 1). If necessary, the user can power-cycle a node. Users have access to nodes through their serial consoles and control ports via the User server. Experiments in DETER do not have direct IP connectivity to the Internet outside the testbed, and experimenters cannot change the configuration of the VLAN switch while the experiment is running.

#### 3.1 Experimental Nodes
Currently, all experimental nodes in the DETER testbed are PC machines, with plans to add commercial routers in the future. The nodes are divided into three homogeneous pools of identical PC hardware configurations. Experimenters can allocate nodes from a specific pool or a combination of pools.

Each PC node can run FreeBSD, Linux, or nearly any OS of the experimenter's choice. As in Emulab, experimenters may have root access to each assigned node. PCs can be configured as routers, end systems, traffic generators, or traffic policers to emulate arbitrary link characteristics.

The DETER testbed includes two clusters:
- An operational cluster of 72 nodes at USC/ISI.
- A second cluster of 32 nodes at UC Berkeley, expected to be operational in August.

The current pools of nodes are:
- 64 IBM Netfinity 4500R (Dual Pentium III 733MHz CPUs with 1GB RAM and 17GB SCSI disk storage) at USC/ISI.
- 8 Sun Microsystems Sun Fire V65X nodes (dual Pentium 2.8 GHz Xeon CPUs with 2GB RAM and 216GB disk storage) at USC/ISI.
- 32 Sun Microsystems Sun Fire v60x (dual Pentium 3.06 GHz CPUs with 2GB RAM and 72GB disk storage) nodes at UC Berkeley (to become operational in October 2004).

#### 3.2 Inter-node Links
Network connections between experimental nodes are created by a programmable backplane consisting of a high-speed Ethernet switch. Each experimental node has four 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet ports connected to the local high-speed Ethernet switch using VLANs. VLANs are used to create the desired experimental topology for each concurrent experiment.

In addition to the four backplane ports, each node has a fifth port, at least 100Mbps, for downloading and controlling the experiment. Experimenters also have access to remote power-cycling control and the serial console interface of each node. Remote access to a running experiment may be limited or disallowed if the experiment poses a risk of spreading outside the designated experimental nodes.

Different Ethernet switch hardware is used at each site. The ISI cluster uses a Cisco 6509 switch, while the UCB cluster uses a Foundry Fast Iron 1500 switch. Each switch is sufficiently over-provisioned to avoid interference between different inter-node logical links. The nodes within a single site are interconnected over high-speed LAN connections with constant and repeatable performance. The ISI and Berkeley pools are interconnected over high-speed Internet links with variable performance. Experimenters can choose which pool(s) to use for allocating nodes to manage this variability.

#### 3.3 Future Plans
During the funding year beginning in October 2004, there are plans to significantly extend the DETER facility. This will include the addition of approximately 60 experimental nodes. Other improvements will involve adding a few commercial routers, enhancing control software to support experiments with risky code, and implementing monitors to detect security or containment breaches.

### 4. Experiment Access
To define and set up an experiment on the DETER testbed, a user (experimenter) defines a configuration using a scripting language derived from the "ns" simulation language. According to this script, the testbed control plane allocates nodes, loads the specified disk images, and starts the experiment.

Each user is given an account on a DETER server machine called "Users" (or “Ops”). This account can be used for staging input and output for the experiment and for experiment-related processing. Each experiment has its own file system that can be mounted from the user's experimental nodes.

The Boss server (Figure 1) runs the web GUI for deterlab.net, used for registering users and projects and for initiating and controlling experiments. Each registered user has an account on the Users machine, and the file system under that account can be NFS-mounted from experimental nodes.

Users do not have direct IP connectivity to an experimental node but can SSH from their account on the "Users" machine into any allocated experimental nodes. Users can also communicate with the experiment through shared files on the user's file system on the User node. If the node OS crashes, the user can reload the OS using the web interface, which includes power cycling the node. For severe containment requirements, users can employ serial console access to each node, allowing the experiment to run in an isolated manner.

Experimental GUIs specifically designed for defining, controlling, and analyzing major classes of security experiments on DETER are under development by the EMIST project.
