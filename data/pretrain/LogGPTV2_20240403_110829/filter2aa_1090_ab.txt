Attack Scenario
● Depending on the sensitivity of the equipment, keystrokes 
can be probed from the nearby room or even farther...
● ...or power plugs can be tampered with their “sniffing” 
version (though this is not really interesting)
● Appealing alternate targets are ATM machines that use PS/2 
or similar keypads (most ATM are standard PCs)
● We are confident that more expensive equipment can lead 
to more precise measurements...the data is (buried) there!

Notes
● This doesn't work against USB keyboards because of differential 
signaling
● There might be other factors responsible in minor part for the 
signal interference on the ground, like power fluctuations of the 
keyboard microcontroller...
● ...these are difficult to pinpoint but they aid the leakage
● Vuagnoux & Pasini attacks seems more practical (kudos to 
them!), unless you shield the room walls but forget about the 
power grid ;), but this attack might have more range
● the attack definetly deserves more investigation! (which we will 
continue in the next months)

us...kudos to them too!

Second Attack
Theory
● As we cannot use the previous attack on laptops we need 
something different
● Previous research addresses keystrokes acoustic
● Laser microphones can be used for monitoring sounds at a 
great distance
● Why not pointing the laser microphone directly at the laptop 
and sample vibrations?
● Profit!

Pattern Matching

● If we spot a 'the' (which is common in the English language) 
we narrow down the odds to 5 cases
● Consider that this sample result involves just 2 or 3 words 
without any previous data (although with 3 common letters 
spread around)
● Sampling more words dramatically increases matching
● Non-word passwords can be narrowed down considerably if 
a sample of English data is available from the same session

Attack Scenario
The Environment
● Obviously a line-of-sight is needed, either in front or above 
the target
● TX / RX can be at completely different locations
● The more money you throw at the equipment the longer the 
range
● Other kinds of laser microphone using interferometry and 
double transmitters can be used
● Attack is possible even with a (possibly double) glass 
window in the way, reflection loss is 4% at every pass
● Infrared laser can be used for stealthyness

Notes
● Changing radically typing position (unusual) and mistyping 
words (very common) decrease accuracy
● Mistyping can be compensated, neural networks and/or 
custom dictionaries with key region mappings instead of 
words can be used for the first pass
● We believe that previous researches against acoustic 
emanations can be applied too
● We know it's hard to get a line of sight for the laser 
microphone, but it could be really worth it :) (social 
engineer your victim!)
