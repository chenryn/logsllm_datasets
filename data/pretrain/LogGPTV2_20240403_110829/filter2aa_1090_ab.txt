# Sniffing Keystrokes with Lasers and Voltmeters

## Overview
This document discusses the feasibility of sniffing keystrokes using lasers and voltmeters, as well as other potential attack scenarios. It includes detailed information on the required equipment, theoretical background, and practical considerations.

## Processing and Equipment
### SPI Interface
- **Microcontroller**
- **Storage**: SD / MMC
- **Cost**: $149.99

## Attack Scenarios
### Keystroke Probing
- **Sensitivity of Equipment**: Keystrokes can be probed from a nearby room or even farther, depending on the sensitivity of the equipment.
- **Power Plugs**: Power plugs can be tampered with to include "sniffing" capabilities, though this method is less interesting.
- **ATM Machines**: ATMs that use PS/2 or similar keypads (most ATMs are standard PCs) are appealing alternate targets.
- **Equipment Cost**: More expensive equipment can lead to more precise measurements, as the data is often buried in the noise.

### Notes
- **USB Keyboards**: This method does not work against USB keyboards due to differential signaling.
- **Signal Interference**: Factors like power fluctuations in the keyboard microcontroller can contribute to signal interference, making it difficult to pinpoint but aiding in the leakage.
- **Vuagnoux & Pasini Attacks**: These attacks seem more practical unless the room walls are shielded, but the power grid remains unshielded. This attack might have a greater range.
- **Further Investigation**: The attack definitely deserves more investigation, which we will continue in the coming months.

## Workarounds

## Public Research
### Relevant Studies
- **Dmitri Asonov, Rakesh Agrawal (2004)**: "Keyboard Acoustic Emanations"
- **Li Zhuang, Feng Zhou, J.D. Tygar (2005)**: “Keyboard Acoustic Emanations Revisited”
- **Acknowledgment**: These researchers are brilliant and much more serious than us; kudos to them.

## Second Attack
### Theory
- **Laptops**: As the previous attack does not work on laptops, a different approach is needed.
- **Acoustic Keystrokes**: Previous research has addressed keystrokes acoustic.
- **Laser Microphones**: Laser microphones can be used for monitoring sounds at a great distance.
- **Direct Monitoring**: Pointing the laser microphone directly at the laptop and sampling vibrations can be effective.
- **Outcome**: Profit!

### Laser Microphone Assembly
- **Components**:
  - 1 x Laser (more expensive lasers mean more range)
  - 1 x Photoresistor or Photodiode
  - 1 x Resistor
  - 1 x AA Battery
  - 1 x Universal Power Adapter
  - 1 x Jack Cable
  - 1 x Laptop with sound card
  - 2 x Tripod
  - 1 x Focusing lens (for long distances)
  - Optional: amplifier, optical bandpass filter, duct tape...

### Cost
- **Total**: $79.99

### TX (The Laser)
- **Class IIIR, 670 nm**:
  - chars 7 <> 8 = 0.029
  - chars 8 <> 7 = 0.029
  - chars 1 <> 8 = 0.072
  - chars 7 <> 1 = 0.066
  - chars 8 <> 1 = 0.072
  - chars 1 <> 3 = 0.167
  - chars 7 <> 3 = 0.161
  - chars 8 <> 3 = 0.146
  - chars 1 <> 10 = 0.188
  - chars 7 <> 10 = 0.191
  - chars 8 <> 6 = 0.226
  - chars 1 <> 6 = 0.209
  - chars 7 <> 6 = 0.270
  - chars 8 <> 10 = 0.244
  - chars 6 <> 10 = 0.160
  - chars 10 <> 6 = 0.160
  - chars 11 <> 1 = 0.065
  - chars 6 <> 1 = 0.209
  - chars 10 <> 7 = 0.191
  - chars 11 <> 8 = 0.029
  - chars 10 <> 1 = 0.188
  - chars 11 <> 7 = 0.072
  - chars 10 <> 8 = 0.244
  - chars 11 <> 3 = 0.146
  - chars 10 <> 3 = 0.250
  - chars 11 <> 6 = 0.226
  - chars 6 <> 3 = 0.343

### Observations
- **Chars 1, 7, 8, and 11** are definitely identical, as are **chars 6 and 10**.
- **Chars 3 and 4** look different from anything else.
- **Final Result with Complete Scoring**: 1?XY321 1321

### Scoring Results
- [Details to be provided]

### Pattern Matching
- **Sample Output**:
  - hogwash hash (???)
  - salmons sons (???)
  - secrets sets (maybe)
  - sermons sons (???)
  - sockets sets (meh)
  - soviets sets (cold war!)
  - statues sues (well everything sues in America)
  - straits sits (???)
  - subways says (???)
  - tempest test (OMG)
  - tidiest test (meh)
  - tiniest test (meh)
  - trident tent (yeah right...)

### Additional Notes
- **Common Words**: If we spot a 'the' (which is common in English), we narrow down the odds to 5 cases.
- **Sampling**: Sampling more words dramatically increases matching.
- **Non-word Passwords**: Non-word passwords can be narrowed down considerably if a sample of English data is available from the same session.

## Attack Scenario: Laptops
- **Asus EEE PC**: Reflective Plastic Case (PWNED!)
- **IBM/Lenovo Thinkpad**: Logo, Wireless Antenna
- **Apple (glossy == evil)**: Case, Glass, and Logo

## The Environment
- **Line-of-Sight**: A line-of-sight is needed, either in front or above the target.
- **TX / RX Locations**: Can be at completely different locations.
- **Range**: More expensive equipment increases the range.
- **Other Lasers**: Interferometry and double transmitters can be used.
- **Glass Windows**: Attack is possible even with a (possibly double) glass window, with reflection loss at 4% per pass.
- **Infrared Lasers**: Can be used for stealth.

### Notes
- **Typing Position**: Changing typing position and mistyping words decrease accuracy.
- **Compensation**: Mistyping can be compensated using neural networks and custom dictionaries.
- **Previous Research**: Research on acoustic emanations can be applied.
- **Social Engineering**: It can be challenging to get a line of sight, but social engineering may help.
