### Title: BlackHat US-22: Flexibly Taming Kernel Execution with Onsite Analysis

Existing kernel analysis tools typically fall into two categories: those that instrument the target kernel to report data from within, and those that use QEMU to gather information from translated execution. Instrumentation-based tools are not suitable for binary-only operating systems like Windows, as they often require recompiling the entire kernel even for minor functional changes. The QEMU-based approach, while more flexible, significantly impacts the performance of the kernel execution.

In this talk, we introduce the Onsite Analysis Infrastructure (OASIS), a novel framework for dynamic kernel analysis. OASIS allows developers to create applications that can control and analyze the execution of a captured kernel thread. These applications can perform tasks such as tracing, setting breakpoints, and collecting data, all as if they were running inside the kernel itselfâ€”hence, "onsite analysis." This method ensures that the analysis is both flexible and efficient, without the need for recompilation or significant performance overhead.

We will also demonstrate several applications that benefit from OASIS, including:
- Full-VM memory introspection
- System call handler control flow tracing
- Kernel event monitoring
- Kernel malware testing

These examples illustrate the versatility and power of OASIS in enhancing the capabilities of kernel analysis.
