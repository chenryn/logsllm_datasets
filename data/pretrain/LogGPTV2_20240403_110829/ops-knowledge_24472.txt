User: I have a code with function sys.stdin.readlines().    

What is the difference between the above one and sys.stdin.buffer.readlines()?. 
What exactly do they do ?
If they read lines from command line,how to stop reading lines at a certain instant and proceed to flow through the program?
Assistant: 1) sys.stdin is a TextIOWrapper, its purpose is to read text from stdin.  The resulting strings will be actual strs.  sys.stdin.buffer is a BufferedReader.  The lines you get from this will be byte strings
2) They read all the lines from stdin until hitting eof or they hit the limit you give them
3) If you're trying to read a single line, you can use .readline() (note: no s).  Otherwise, when interacting with the program on the command line, you'd have to give it the EOF signal (Ctrl+D on *nix)
Is there a reason you are doing this rather than just calling input() to get one text line at a time from stdin?
