User: I'm trying to get Python support in gVim on Windows. Is there a way to accomplish that?
I'm using:

Windows XP SP3
gVim v. 7.3
Python 2.7.13 (ActivePython through Windows Installer binaries)
Assistant: When I typed :version, it revealed that my Vim was not compiled with Python. Perhaps because I did not have Python (32-bit?) at the time. 
I did install 32-bit Python as suggested, but reinstalling Vim seemed necessary.
