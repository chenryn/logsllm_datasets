ABSTRACT
Wi-Fi Calling, which is used to make and receive calls over the Wi-
Fi network, has been widely adopted and deployed to extend the
coverage and increase the capacity in weak signal areas by moving
traffic from LTE to Wi-Fi networks. However, the security of Wi-Fi
Calling mechanism has not been fully analyzed, and Wi-Fi Calling
may inherently have greater security risks than conventional LTE
calling. To provide secure connections with confidentiality and
integrity, Wi-Fi Calling leverages the IETF protocols IKEv2 and
IPSec.
In this paper, we analyze the security of Wi-Fi Calling specifica-
tions and discover several vulnerabilities that allow an adversary to
track the location of users and perform DoS attacks. By setting up
a rogue access point in live testbed environment, we observe that
user devices can leak the International Mobile Subscriber Identity
(IMSI), despite it being encrypted. The leaked information can be
further exploited for tracking user locations. We also discuss how
these protocols are vulnerable to several denial of service attacks.
To protect user privacy and services against these attacks, we
propose practical countermeasures. We also present trade-off con-
siderations that pose challenges for us to apply countermeasures
to mitigate the existing vulnerabilities. Additionally, we propose to
introduce corresponding amendments for future specifications of
protocols to address these trade-offs.

1 INTRODUCTION
The evolution of mobile communication systems has heavily fo-
cused on supporting various forms of data. However, voice con-
tinues to exist as a core element of the mobile network operators
(MNOs) business model [13]. The critical success factor for voice
is wide coverage and sufficient capacity so that users do not ex-
perience dropped calls, black spots, or awkward hand-offs across
networks. In this context, the Wi-Fi Calling, or Voice over Wi-Fi
(VoWi-Fi), has been proposed as a solution to extend the coverage
and improve the capacity in low signal areas by moving traffic be-
tween Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and Wi-Fi connections. Instead
of using the carrier’s mobile network, Wi-Fi Calling can make voice
calls via a Wi-Fi network with regular phone numbers and does not
require any additional applications, such as Skype 1 or WhatsApp 2.
Recently, most MNOs are integrating their VoLTE (Voice over
LTE) services with Wi-Fi Calling to offload voice services in areas
where their licensed spectrum coverage is limited [22]. When it
comes to major MNOs in the U.S., every T-Mobile phone offers
Wi-Fi Calling as a built-in feature. For Sprint, it is available on both
iPhone (iOS 9.1 or higher) and Android variants. Similarly, AT&T
offers Wi-Fi Calling for 23 models, and Verizon has 33 models in its
Wi-Fi lineup. Republic Wireless and Google Project Fi also support
Wi-Fi Calling feature on their phones as well [11]. It is projected
that 90% of the major 62 MNOs in the world will deploy Wi-Fi
Calling by 2020 [27].

J. Baek et al.
To maintain and enhance the security in Wi-Fi Calling, two
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols — Internet Key
Exchange (IKEv2) and IP Security (IPSec) — are used for network
traffic [1]. There is a general belief that those protocols provide
strong privacy and availability guarantees to mobile subscribers,
even when used in an unprotected Wi-Fi network. However, it is
critical to scrutinize what potential attacks and vulnerabilities can
be found in the current Wi-Fi Calling systems.
Also, albeit the MNOs continue to expand Wi-Fi Calling services
for its effectiveness, most of the recent research has focused on
analysis of the LTE security and the privacy. O’Hanlon et al. [24] and
Chalakkal el al. [10] proposed the International Mobile Subscriber
Identity (IMSI) privacy threat in Wi-Fi Calling. However, they did
not analyze possible denial-of-service (DoS) attacks in Wi-Fi Calling
environment, and omitted the detail implementation procedure of
the threat. In addition, those works did not evaluate the proposed
threat against the MNOs and devices.
In this paper, we analyze Wi-Fi Calling related protocol specifica-
tions with an empirical approach and identify several vulnerabilities
based on the analysis results. Subsequently, we show that it is possi-
ble to exchange forged and manipulated packets successfully with
the sender and receiver without any identity validation process. By
building a rogue AP equipped with an IPSec server in live testbed
Wi-Fi networks, we confirm that user devices can leak the IMSI,
which can cause critical privacy problems, such as tracking user
locations. Moreover, we find those protocols can be vulnerable
to several DoS attacks. All of the vulnerabilities we found stem
from the lack of mutual authentication mechanism in the security
negotiation phase.
With regards to defense mechanisms, we propose several practi-
cal countermeasures to protect user’s privacy and usability against
IMSI leaking and DoS attacks. We also discuss trade-off considera-
tions on the security of Wi-Fi Calling including why those vulnera-
bilities exist.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• Empirical analysis of the Wi-Fi Calling specifications:
We analyze Wi-Fi Calling protocol specifications and un-
cover several vulnerabilities experimentally. We classify these
attacks into two different categories: IMSI privacy attacks
and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In the IMSI privacy at-
tack, we describe the feasibility of the server impersonation
attack using the lack of mutual authentication. In the DoS
attack, we demonstrate how three different messages can
force a user equipment (UE) into a vulnerable state, leading
to DoS attacks.
• Implementation and Evaluation of Attacks: We design
and implement the IMSI privacy attack and DoS attack that
can be deployed on a laptop with a Wi-Fi interface and con-
firm their effectiveness using low-cost devices. We demon-
strate that these attacks can be easily built and operated
using readily available tools. We describe our experiments
and procedures that are based on commercially available
hardware and software. We also evaluate the attacks using
commercially available smartphones in real (lab-controlled)
networks.

• Security Analysis: We discuss the underlying reasons for
the vulnerabilities, along with trade-offs between securi-
ty/privacy and other criteria such as usability, deployment
cost, and recommended fixes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we provide an overview of the Wi-Fi Calling technologies. In Sec-
tion 3, we analyze the possible threats and attack in Wi-Fi Calling.
Then, we present our attack scenarios and explain how we imple-
ment our attacks in Section 4 and 5 for IMSI privacy and DoS attack
respectively. We also discuss the impact and applicability of the
attacks in those section. Based on the analysis, we propose the
countermeasures in Section 6. We discuss the trade-offs between
usability and deployment issues in Section 7. Section 8, we compare
our approach with other related works. Finally, we conclude our
work in Section 9.
2 WI-FI CALLING
We briefly describe the Wi-Fi Calling architecture as well as security
mechanisms for understanding the vulnerabilities and attacks we
propose in this work.
2.1 Wi-Fi Calling Architecture
The Wi-Fi Calling feature evolved based on the LTE architecture.
We consider a simplified architecture: we skip other details of the
architecture that are not relevant from the point of view of under-
standing our attacks. Figure 1 depicts this simplified architecture
which contains three main components: User Equipment (UE), Ra-
dio Access Network (RAN), and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) 3GPP
specification. The three components are described below.
User Equipment (UE). UE refers to the actual communication de-
vice, such as smartphones, tablets, and any devices equipped
with Wi-Fi and cellular interfaces. A UE stores the Inter-
national Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) in a Subscriber
Identity Module (SIM) card [6]. The IMSI is a globally unique

15 digit identifier of a subscriber consisting of the mobile
country code (MCC, 3 digits), the mobile network code (MNC,
2 or 3 digits), and the mobile subscriber identification num-
ber (MSIN, 10 digits). When the UE joins to the network for
the first time, the IMSI is used for authenticating a subscriber
by the network with Home Subscriber Server (HSS) which
has a user database for performing authentication.
Radio Access Network (RAN). RAN consists of an AP to manage
the radio signals with the UE and facilitates communication
between the UE and EPC. The protocols, specifications, and
functions of the AP are the same as the generic IEEE 802.11-
based APs used in homes, offices, and public places.
Evolved Packet Core (EPC). EPC is a core network framework for
providing voice and data services on an LTE network [1]. It
consists of several elements as defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [3].
However, we describe only the Evolved Packet Data Gateway
(ePDG), which is newly introduced in the LTE architecture
to support Wi-Fi Calling. The ePDG acts as the gateway
between the public Internet and EPC. ePDG is responsible
for authenticating to UEs when they connect to the network
involving security association (IKEv2/IPsec-based setting up
integrity and encryption for signaling) [4].
2.2 Wi-Fi Calling Handshakes
In Wi-Fi Calling, a UE and an ePDG must perform message hand-
shakes in two phases to establish an IPSec tunnel for secure com-
munication. Figure 2(a) briefly shows the IPSec two-step handshake
process: IKE security negotiation between UE (initiator) and the
ePDG (responder) [18]. IKE is used for performing mutual authen-
tication and establishing and maintaining Security Associations
(SAs). A security association (SA) is a set of policy and key(s) used
to protect information used by the negotiating peers.
The first phase of the Wi-Fi Calling handshake is illustrated in
Figure 2(b) in detail:
(1) A UE sends the IKE_SA_INIT_REQ message to ePDG with
cryptographic materials (Diffie-Hellman (D-H) and nonce
values) for creating the IKE Security Association (SA).
(2) ePDG checks security parameters delivered from the UE
and sends the IKE_SA_INIT_RES including cryptographic
materials to the UE. At this point, each party can generate
the key materials for all of the proceeding messages.
(3) After the IKE_SA_INIT exchange messages, the payloads of
the IKE_AUTH_REQ, which contains the identity (IMSI) of the
UE, are encrypted and integrity protected using SK_e (en-
cryption) and SK_a (authentication or integrity protection)
derived from the Diffie-Hellman (D-H) value to protect the
IKE SA.
(4) Once the UE transmits message, IKE_AUTH_RES, correspond-
ingly the ePDG validates the identity of the UE and sets up
an SA for the first AH or ESP child SA with message.
3 SECURITY IN WI-FI CALLING
The security of Wi-Fi Calling mechanism inherently has the same
risks as the conventional WI-Fi network. Here, we briefly overview
possible threats and attacks under the Wi-Fi network based on 3GPP
Technical Specification 33.234 [1]. Furthermore, we demonstrate

specific attacks which should be taken into consideration carefully
when deploying security mechanisms for Wi-Fi Calling. Table 1
summarizes all possible threats and attacks in Wi-Fi network, which
also identifies what attacks are specific to Wi-Fi Calling from the
others. Regarding the Wi-Fi Calling specific threats and attacks, we
discovered two vulnerabilities: (1) the lack of mutual authentica-
tion and (2) unprotected message exchanges in handshaking. By
exploiting these vulnerabilities, we can carry out the IMSI privacy
attack and the DoS attack using deauthentication frames against
UEs.
3.1 Privacy of Users
The privacy data in mobile networks includes users’ personal in-
formation, such as the IMSI that can be used to identify a specific
user. Also, the privacy data includes information of a user’s service
subscription and physical location at a given time. If an attacker
obtains the privacy data such as the IMSI, the attacker can track
where and when the user has accessed Wi-Fi services.
IMSI privacy attacks for tracking the user location in mobile com-
munications are commonly known problems. The IMSI catcher [31],
