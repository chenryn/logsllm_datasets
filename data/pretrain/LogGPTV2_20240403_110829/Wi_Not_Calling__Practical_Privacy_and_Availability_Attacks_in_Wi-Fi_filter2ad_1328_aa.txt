## Abstract
Wi-Fi Calling, which allows users to make and receive calls over a Wi-Fi network, has been widely adopted to extend coverage and increase capacity in areas with weak cellular signals. However, the security of Wi-Fi Calling mechanisms has not been thoroughly analyzed, potentially exposing greater security risks compared to conventional LTE calling. To ensure secure connections, Wi-Fi Calling uses IETF protocols such as IKEv2 and IPSec.

In this paper, we analyze the security of Wi-Fi Calling specifications and identify several vulnerabilities that allow an adversary to track user locations and perform Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. By setting up a rogue access point in a live testbed environment, we observed that user devices can leak the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), even when it is encrypted. This leaked information can be exploited for tracking user locations. We also discuss how these protocols are vulnerable to various DoS attacks.

To protect user privacy and services against these attacks, we propose practical countermeasures and discuss the trade-offs that pose challenges in applying these countermeasures. Additionally, we suggest amendments to future protocol specifications to address these trade-offs.

## 1 Introduction
The evolution of mobile communication systems has focused on supporting various forms of data, but voice remains a core element of mobile network operators' (MNOs) business models. Wide coverage and sufficient capacity are critical for ensuring reliable voice services. Wi-Fi Calling, or Voice over Wi-Fi (VoWi-Fi), extends coverage and improves capacity in low-signal areas by offloading traffic from LTE to Wi-Fi networks. Unlike traditional VoIP applications like Skype or WhatsApp, Wi-Fi Calling uses regular phone numbers and does not require additional applications.

Most MNOs are integrating their Voice over LTE (VoLTE) services with Wi-Fi Calling to offload voice services in areas with limited spectrum coverage. Major U.S. MNOs, including T-Mobile, Sprint, AT&T, and Verizon, offer Wi-Fi Calling on numerous device models. It is projected that 90% of major MNOs worldwide will deploy Wi-Fi Calling by 2020.

To maintain and enhance security in Wi-Fi Calling, two Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols—Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2) and IP Security (IPSec)—are used. While these protocols are believed to provide strong privacy and availability guarantees, it is crucial to scrutinize potential vulnerabilities and attacks in current Wi-Fi Calling systems.

Recent research has primarily focused on LTE security and privacy, with some studies identifying IMSI privacy threats in Wi-Fi Calling. However, these studies did not analyze possible DoS attacks or provide detailed implementation procedures.

In this paper, we empirically analyze Wi-Fi Calling protocol specifications and identify several vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that it is possible to exchange forged and manipulated packets without identity validation. Using a rogue access point equipped with an IPSec server in a live testbed, we confirm that user devices can leak the IMSI, leading to critical privacy issues such as location tracking. We also find that these protocols are vulnerable to several DoS attacks, stemming from the lack of mutual authentication in the security negotiation phase.

We propose practical countermeasures to protect user privacy and usability against IMSI leaking and DoS attacks. We also discuss trade-off considerations regarding the security of Wi-Fi Calling.

### Contributions
- **Empirical Analysis of Wi-Fi Calling Specifications:** We uncover several vulnerabilities experimentally, classifying them into IMSI privacy attacks and DoS attacks.
- **Implementation and Evaluation of Attacks:** We design and implement the IMSI privacy attack and DoS attack, confirming their effectiveness using low-cost devices and commercially available smartphones.
- **Security Analysis:** We discuss the underlying reasons for the vulnerabilities and the trade-offs between security/privacy and other criteria such as usability and deployment cost.

## 2 Wi-Fi Calling
We provide an overview of Wi-Fi Calling technologies, including the architecture and security mechanisms, to understand the vulnerabilities and attacks we propose.

### 2.1 Wi-Fi Calling Architecture
Wi-Fi Calling evolved based on the LTE architecture. The simplified architecture includes three main components: User Equipment (UE), Radio Access Network (RAN), and Evolved Packet Core (EPC).

- **User Equipment (UE):** Refers to communication devices like smartphones and tablets. UE stores the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) in a SIM card. The IMSI is a globally unique 15-digit identifier consisting of the mobile country code (MCC), mobile network code (MNC), and mobile subscriber identification number (MSIN).
- **Radio Access Network (RAN):** Consists of an Access Point (AP) to manage radio signals and facilitate communication between the UE and EPC.
- **Evolved Packet Core (EPC):** A core network framework providing voice and data services on an LTE network. The Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) acts as the gateway between the public Internet and EPC, responsible for authenticating UEs and setting up security associations using IKEv2/IPsec.

### 2.2 Wi-Fi Calling Handshakes
Wi-Fi Calling involves a two-phase handshake process to establish an IPSec tunnel for secure communication.

1. **IKE_SA_INIT Phase:**
   - The UE sends an IKE_SA_INIT_REQ message to the ePDG with cryptographic materials.
   - The ePDG checks the security parameters and responds with IKE_SA_INIT_RES, allowing both parties to generate key materials.
2. **IKE_AUTH Phase:**
   - The UE sends an IKE_AUTH_REQ message containing the UE's identity (IMSI), encrypted and integrity-protected using SK_e and SK_a.
   - The ePDG validates the UE's identity and sets up an SA for the child SA.

## 3 Security in Wi-Fi Calling
The security of Wi-Fi Calling mechanisms inherently carries the same risks as conventional Wi-Fi networks. We overview possible threats and attacks under the Wi-Fi network based on 3GPP Technical Specification 33.234. We demonstrate specific attacks that should be considered when deploying security mechanisms for Wi-Fi Calling.

### 3.1 Privacy of Users
Privacy data in mobile networks includes personal information such as the IMSI, which can be used to identify a specific user. If an attacker obtains the IMSI, they can track the user's location and access times. IMSI catchers are commonly known tools for intercepting IMSI information.

By exploiting the lack of mutual authentication and unprotected message exchanges in handshaking, we can carry out IMSI privacy attacks and DoS attacks using deauthentication frames against UEs.

## 4 Implementation and Evaluation of Attacks
We design and implement the IMSI privacy attack and DoS attack, confirming their effectiveness using low-cost devices and commercially available smartphones. We describe our experiments and procedures based on commercially available hardware and software.

### 4.1 IMSI Privacy Attack
- **Feasibility of Server Impersonation:** We demonstrate the feasibility of server impersonation using the lack of mutual authentication.
- **Experimental Setup:** We set up a rogue AP with an IPSec server in a live testbed and confirm that user devices can leak the IMSI.

### 4.2 DoS Attack
- **Vulnerable States:** We show how three different messages can force a UE into a vulnerable state, leading to DoS attacks.
- **Experimental Setup:** We use readily available tools to build and operate these attacks, demonstrating their effectiveness in real (lab-controlled) networks.

## 5 Security Analysis
We discuss the underlying reasons for the vulnerabilities, including the lack of mutual authentication and the trade-offs between security/privacy and other criteria such as usability and deployment cost.

## 6 Countermeasures
We propose several practical countermeasures to protect user privacy and usability against IMSI leaking and DoS attacks. These include:
- **Enhanced Mutual Authentication:** Implementing stronger mutual authentication mechanisms.
- **Message Protection:** Enhancing the protection of message exchanges during handshaking.
- **Network Monitoring:** Deploying network monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and mitigate attacks.

## 7 Trade-offs
We discuss the trade-offs between usability and deployment issues, including the balance between enhanced security measures and the impact on user experience and deployment costs.

## 8 Related Work
We compare our approach with other related works, highlighting the unique contributions and findings of our study.

## 9 Conclusion
In conclusion, we have analyzed the security of Wi-Fi Calling specifications and identified several vulnerabilities. We have demonstrated the feasibility of IMSI privacy and DoS attacks and proposed practical countermeasures to protect user privacy and services. Future work should focus on implementing and testing these countermeasures in real-world scenarios.
