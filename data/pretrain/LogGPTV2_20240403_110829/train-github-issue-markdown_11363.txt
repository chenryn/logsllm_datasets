When running the following code in an iPython notebook, it runs for a long
time producing no output, and then the iPython kernel crashes and has to
restart.
    import numpy as np
    from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
    X = np.random.random((100000, 100))
    tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=40, learning_rate=100, verbose=2).fit_transform(X)
Running the same code from the command line produces one line of output
`[t-SNE] Computing pairwise distances...`
and then it dies.
The error is pretty much the same as reported in this older issue. I'll attach
a crash log next, but I think it's out of memory because if I reduce the rows
of X to 10000, then it runs to completion without error.
Some suggested improvements:
  * Estimate the memory required to carry out this operation and warn or error out earlier.
  * Try to recover from OOM errors in libBLAS more gracefully.
  * If possible, reduce the memory requirements of sklearn.manifold.TSNE or implement out-of-core
  * Document the memory requirements in sklearn.manifold (and sklearn.decomposition), and perhaps warn about potential OOM errors and what they'll look like to users. You've already nicely documented the runtime complexities of the algorithms but have not documented their space complexities.
