1 简介
本文档介绍H3C SecPath F1000-C8102 防火墙和H3C SecPath F1000-ServerBlade 服务器安全
智能模块日志信息，包含日志的参数介绍、产生原因、处理建议等，为用户进行系统诊断和维护提
供参考。
本文假设您已具备数据通信技术知识，并熟悉H3C网络产品。
1.1 日志格式说明
缺省情况下，日志采用如下格式：
time name msg
表1-1 日志头字段说明
字段 描述
PRI部分由尖括号包含的一个数字构成，这个数字包含了程序模块（Facility）、严重性（Severity），
pri
这个数字是由Facility乘以 8，然后加上Severity得来
时间紧跟在PRI后面，中间没有空格，格式必须是“Mmm dd hh:mm:ss”，不包括年份。“日”的
数字如果是1～9，前面会补一个空格（也就是月份后面有两个空格），而“小时”、“分”、“秒”
time
则在前面补“0”。月份取值包括：Jan、Feb、Mar、Apr、May、Jun、Jul、Aug、Sep、Oct、Nov、
Dec
设备名称或IP，注意，name字段一定要包含sn，格式是：
name device_name;sn;ipversion;msgversion
Ipversion包括：ipv4,ipv6
msg 该日志的具体内容，包含事件或错误发生的详细信息。
日志信息按严重性可划分为如表1-2所示的八个等级，各等级的严重性依照数值从0～7依次降低。
表1-2 日志等级说明
级别 严重程度 描述
0 Emergency 表示设备不可用的信息，如系统授权已到期
1 Alert 表示设备出现重大故障，需要立刻做出反应的信息，如流量超出接口上限
2 Critical 表示严重信息，如设备温度已经超过预警值，设备电源、风扇出现故障等
3 Error 表示错误信息，如接口链路状态变化，存储卡拔出等
4 Warning 表示警告信息，如接口连接断开，内存耗尽告警等
5 Notification 表示正常出现但是重要的信息，如通过终端登录设备，设备重启等
表示需要记录的通知信息，如通过命令行输入命令的记录信息，执行ping命令
6 Informational
的日志信息等
7 Debug 表示调试过程产生的信息
本文使用表1-3定义的方式表示日志描述字段中的可变参数域。
1
表1-3 可变参数域
参数标识 参数类型
INT16 有符号的16位整数
UINT16 无符号的16位整数
INT32 有符号的32位整数
UINT32 无符号的32位整数
INT64 有符号的64位整数
UINT64 无符号的64位整数
DOUBLE 有符号的双32位整数，格式为：[INT32].[INT32]
HEX 十六进制数
CHAR 字节类型
STRING 字符串类型
IPADDR IP地址
MAC MAC地址
DATE 日期
TIME 时间
1.2 如何获取日志信息
缺省情况下，设备的日志功能处于开启状态，并允许向控制台（console）、WEB 页面、日志服务
器（loghost）和本地日志文件（logfile）方向输出日志信息。您可以在 WEB 页面上实时看到系统
输出的日志信息，也可以通过display log event命令查看事件日志信息。
通过log命令可以设置日志信息的输出规则，通过输出规则可以指定日志的输出方向以及对哪些特
性模块或信息等级的日志信息进行输出。所有信息等级高于或等于设置等级的日志信息都会被输出
到指定的输出方向。例如，输出规则中如果指定允许等级为 6（informational）的信息输出，则等
级0～6的信息均会被输出到指定的输出方向。
• 监视终端是指以AUX、VTY、TTY类型用户线登录的用户终端。
• 配置日志服务器后，日志服务器也可以实时监控日志信息。
• 本地日志文件可以记录日志信息，但仅能通过WEB页面查看。
1.2.1 将日志信息保存到日志文件
缺省情况下，系统根据通过log命令配置的日志过滤条件，将需要记录的日志实时记录到日志文件
当中。日志文件中的内容可以通过WEB页面中的日志查询实时查看。
2
1.2.2 将日志信息发送到日志服务器
您可以通过配置日志服务器向指定的IP地址发送设备的日志信息，还可同时配置日志服务器接收日
志信息的端口号（该值需要和日志主机侧的设置一致，缺省为514）。如果设备侧配置的日志服务器
接收日志信息的端口号与日志服务器侧不一致，则日志服务器将无法接收日志信息。
您可以指定多个不同服务器同时接收设备产生的日志信息。但最多可指定3个。
1.3 日志模块列表
表1-4列出了所有可能生成日志信息的日志模块。
表1-4 日志模块列表
模块名 说明
系统管理日志 包括系统操作日志和系统状态日志
流量日志 与流量相关的日志
网站访问日志 所有访问过的网站
恶意URL日志 访问的恶意URL
上网行为日志 上网行为产生的日志
防攻击日志 发生攻击的日志
系统事件日志 系统事件，比如接口up/down
1.4 文档使用说明
本文将系统日志信息按照日志模块分类。
本文以表格的形式对日志信息进行介绍。有关表中各项的含义请参考表1-5。
表1-5 日志信息表内容说明
表项 说明 举例
ACL [$1:UINT32] [$2:STRING] [$3:COUNTER64]
日志内容 显示日志信息的具体内容
packet(s).
按照参数在日志中出现的顺序对参数
$1：ACL编号
进行解释。
参数解释 $2：ACL规则的ID和内容
参数顺序用“$数字”表示，例如“$1”
$3：与ACL规则匹配的数据包个数
表示在该日志中出现的第一个参数。
日志等级 日志严重等级 6
operator_name=admin; operate_ip=192.168.1.105;
create_time=2014-07-22
举例 一个真实的日志信息举例。
17:56:32;level=notice;reason=mod;result=success;man
agestyle=WEB;content=mod syslog configuration
匹配一条ACL规则的数据包个数。该日志会在数据包个数
