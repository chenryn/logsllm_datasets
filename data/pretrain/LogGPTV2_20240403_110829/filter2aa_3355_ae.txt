4.4.4 Onboard Generator Systems 
A recent development in power supply sys-
tems for mobile equipment is the use of ad-
vanced generators operating off the vehi-
cle's engine.  These generators are capable 
of supplying up to 10 kilowatts of power 
output. These systems convert the idling 
engine speed to AC electrical supply step-
ping up the engine idle only as higher output 
is required.  
The supplier of this patented system is 
Auragen, Inc., which has units available for 
most vehicles manufactured after 1996. The 
use of retired fire/rescue apparatus as 
mounting platforms for the JPS system may 
prevent use of these newer systems.  These 
new systems may be an attractive option for 
minimizing setup time, noise, and generator 
maintenance. With a system installed in a 
mobile communications van, it may be pos-
sible to have the TRP-1000 operational prior 
to arriving on the scene. 
4.5 JPS Corporate Support 
JPS Communications, Inc. has pioneered 
the use of radio interoperability systems for 
use by emergency response personnel. 
They are committed to providing continuing 
customer support and further improvements 
to existing systems, as they are made avail-
able. 
4.5.1 Cabling Issues 
JPS has schematic diagrams available to 
any jurisdiction that needs to connect addi-
tional radios to the TRP-1000 system be-
yond the radios installed with the basic con-
figuration. Some jurisdictions with commu-
nications technicians or specialists have the 
capability, and prefer to make their own ca-
bles. Other jurisdictions have requested 
JPS supply the completed cables. JPS has 
created a catalog of available connection 
cables available for purchase. (See Appen-
dix for JPS Communications, Inc., contact 
information)

4.5.2 Initial Training and Set-Up 
JPS will provide training and setup assis-
tance to any jurisdiction purchasing the 
TRP-1000 systems.  They are willing to as-
sist with initial programming issues and to 
assure capable training is provided.  (See 
Appendix for JPS Communications, Inc. 
contact information) 
4.5.3 Software Upgrades 
JPS will provide free software upgrades to 
existing systems as they become available. 
Users should contact JPS to determine if 
upgrades are available for their unit.  (See

contact information) 
4.5.4 Assistance at Major Scheduled 
Events  
JPS has provided local, state, and federal 
responders with major event deployments, 
including free technical assistance and 
training or operators for the unit as re-
quested.  (See Appendix for JPS Communi-
cations, Inc. contact information)

5 OPERATING SYSTEM MOD-
ELS 
The following are examples of three com-
munities that have established multi-agency 
interoperability 
communications 
systems 
using the ACU/TRP-1000 system.  These 
communities have undertaken initial set-up 
and operation projects aimed at providing 
high performance multi-agency communica-
tions support for emergency response inci-
dents. 
These project models are presented here in 
order to demonstrate the extraordinary ca-
pability of the ACU/TRP-1000 system, and 
to provide insight and ideas to those devel-
oping their own high performance interoper-
able communications system. The exam-
ples cited do not represent the complete 
capability, nor all the possible options and 
configurations possible with the ACU/TRP-
1000 system.  However, they do demon-
strate a dynamic and comprehensive ap-
proach to solving interoperability communi-
cations problems.  
The projects selected are from three distinct 
types of jurisdictions.  Those selected pre-
sent a model from a very large metropolitan 
city, a large growing urban community, and 
a rural/ large city interface jurisdiction.  The 
intent is to present ideas and examples 
covering a variety of settings, background, 
and terrains. 
ODP recognizes that, although the project 
models described here are comprehensive, 
they are not perfect, nor are they the only 
jurisdictions with advanced or high perform-
ance interoperable communication system 
projects.  
5.1 Chicago, Illinois Project 
Chicago is the third largest city in the U.S. 
and has a population of nearly 3 million 
people.  The Chicago metropolitan area 
covers an area of 228.5 square miles that 
encompasses the City and its surrounding 
suburbs and includes six counties in Illinois 
(Cook, Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane and 
Will).  In 2000, the Chicago Fire Department 
responded to over 500,000 calls for help 
responding to various incidents involving 
people with emergency medical conditions 
as well as calls to preserve property.  The 
department has six districts, 24 battalions, 
and a uniformed force of almost 5,000, in-
cluding paramedics. 
In 2000, Chicago acquired six TRP-1000 
systems.  Two units stay in the command 
center.  Two units are reserved for deploy-
ment on an as-needed basis with neighbor-
ing jurisdictions.  One has been installed in 
a surplus vehicle and the final unit will be 
similarly deployed.  One of the mobile sys-
tems will be shared with federal agencies.  
The goal is to support 67 jurisdictions in the 
metropolitan area.  
The City of Chicago's Office of Emergency 
Communications (OEC) is charged with 
providing 911/311 call answering and dis-
patching of Police/Fire/Emergency Medical 
Services (EMS) personnel within the corpo-
rate city limits of Chicago.  The OEC also 
has the responsibility of transferring any 
calls for service received that require the 
response of a suburban public safety 
agency. 
The OEC is responsible for staffing a Field 
Communications vehicle.  The vehicle is 
operational on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a 
week basis and is staffed with an opera-
tor/driver and an electrical mechanic/ driver.  
Face-to-face relief at the incident scene al-
lows for the continuity of communications 
services.  The staff for the vehicle has been 
selected based on previous dispatch ex-
perience, effectiveness in following guide-
lines and procedures, knowledge of both fire 
and police dispatch operations and geo-
graphical knowledge. 
The OEC, in conjunction with participating 
agencies, adopted a training manual con-
sisting of specific modules involving these 
agencies and their operational concerns 
and practices.  Training of the Field Com-
munications vehicle staff took place at the 
OEC, and consisted of the pre-approved 
course along with specific training on the 
operations of the TRP-1000.  
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 5-2 
Each member of the Field Communications 
staff also received vehicle operation train-
ing, driver training, and training in the use of 
personal protective equipment.  Classroom 
and drivers training lasted three weeks.  
Regularly scheduled in-service training cou-
pled with drills and exercises supplement 
this formal training.  The Field Communica-
tions staff "tours" with the Field Communica-
tions vehicle in order to provide on-site in-
formational training to participating agen-
cies. 
The Field Communications vehicle is a re-
furbished 1992, Ford F350, with an ambu-
lance body.  The vehicle is equipped with a 
hydraulic extendible 50-foot tower that dra-
matically increases the range of the system.  
As shown in Figure 5-1, the components 
are still housed in their shock resistant 
cases for increased protection and mobility.  
These units can still be removed from the 
ambulance and installed elsewhere rela-
tively quickly. 
The vehicle currently houses a JPS TRP-
1000 interoperability system with five UHF 
and five VHF radios.  The system has a file 
that tracks and logs connections of any 
phone numbers called as well as date, time 
and who connected or disconnected.  OEC 
has also installed two 800 MHz radios, one 
470-512 MHz radio, and one Motorola Low 
Band radio. 
Data communications are currently handled 
by two Motorola MW520 mobile data com-
puters with 1000 nit screens and one Micro-
slate portable data terminal.  The Field Com 
vehicle is also equipped with one mobile 
cellular phone and a fax/copy/printer.  The 
vehicle 
carries 
10 
portable 
Motorola 
XTS3500 450 MHz radios, 10 spare batter-
ies, and two Cadex C7000 Battery Condi-
tioners/Analyzers. 
The vehicle is equipped with its own on-
board charging system and has a portable 
5KW (kilo watt) gas generator that is carried 
on the rear tailboard to provide extended 
electrical power.  The vehicle carries two 
100 foot 12/3 electrical cables with quad 
boxes and two 25 foot 12/3 cables. 
5.1.1 Chicago, Illinois TRP-1000 De-
ployment 
The Chicago Fire Department is currently a 
member of the Mutual Aid Box Alarm Sys-
tem (MABAS).  The system involves over 
700 separate fire departments in Illinois, 
Southern Wisconsin, Northeastern Indiana, 
and Southwestern Michigan operating on 
over 100 different radio frequencies. Field 
Communications is scheduled to respond 
on all 2nd alarm, or greater calls, and will 
also respond on special requests for inter-
operability communications. 
The Field Communications unit responds on 
all aircraft disasters and accompanies the 
Chicago Fire Department's mobile com-
mand center located at O'Hare Field.  The 
command center responds to all aircraft 
disasters within 150 miles of Chicago.  The 
Field Communications vehicle will fit in a C-
130 (or larger) aircraft for transport if neces-
sary. 
Field Communications responds to all major 
power outages in the metropolitan area.  
The unit provides local public safety agen-
cies with communications between them-
selves and other responders as well as local 
utility providers.  Field Communications also 
responds on all requests for communica-
tions needs at the scene of marine inci-
dents.  Field Communications will respond 
Figure 5-1  View of TRP-1000 mounted in-
side Chicago Fire Departmentâ€™s Field 
Communication Van. 
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 5-3 
to hostage/barricade incidents.  The unit 
also responds to all requests from subur-
ban, county, and state law enforcement 
agencies involved in hostage/barricade inci-
dents.  The Field Communications unit re-
sponds on all level II, or greater, HazMat 
incidents. 
On any given day in the City of Chicago, 
over 30 law enforcement agencies operate 
inside the city limits.  Currently, none of 
these agencies can communicate with each 
other.  
Additionally, the Field Communications unit 
responds and provides needed communica-
tions interoperability to the requesting agen-
cies.  It will NOT replace incident command 
at the scene, but will act as a clearinghouse 
for communications between agencies.  
Immediately following its deployment, the 
operating staff of the Field Communications 
is available for debriefing and critiquing of 
the incident.  They prepare a formal report 
objectively outlining their participation in the 
event and forward the report to the Incident 
Commander. 
5.1.2 Chicago, Illinois Operation 
Plan 
The Office of Emergency Communications 
has verbal commitments from the Chicago 
Fire Department, Chicago Police Depart-
ment, various city service agencies, the Illi-
nois Department of Public Health, and the 
Chicago healthcare industry. They also 
have commitments from the MABAS (cover-
ing 700 fire departments), the Illinois Asso-
ciation of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the 
Community Fireman's Association (CFA 
covering 70 Fire Departments in Northern 
Indiana and Southwestern Michigan), FBI, 
ATF, and the US Army National Guard Civil 
Support Team (CST). 
The Chicago OEC Multi Agency radio Inter-
operability Project (MARIP) team has just 
been given the results of a survey commis-
sioned by the team on 75 surrounding cities 
in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.  The sur-
vey was conducted by a team from the cit-
ies Executive Management School.  The 
survey asked for each city to designate their 
main channel/s of communication (be they 
Fire/Police/EMS or Public Works) and to 
identify a channel that their departments 
could use as a secondary channel.  This 
secondary channel will be designated their 
interoperability channel for the MARIP. 
Our next step will be to begin the process of 
inviting each discipline in the project to a 
briefing.  The disciplines will include Police, 
Fire/EMS, County, State, Federal, Military, 
Mass Transportation and Public Utilities/ 
Public Works.  As an example - We will ask 
the Police Departments to appear and brief 
those with the program, and after a demo of 
the Field Com/TRP1000 ask them to select 
a 13 person representative committee (12 
members and 1 Chairperson) to work on 
developing an operational plan for the vehi-
cle.  The time line for plan submission will 
be 3 months.  After all the plans are submit-
ted we will again meet with all the commit-
tee chairs and digest their reports to design 
a master plan.  We project that by July 1, 
2002, we will be ready for full implementa-
tion. 
5.2 Orlando, Florida Project 
Orlando is one of the fastest growing cities 
in America, presently encompassing over 
105 square miles.  The greater metropolitan 
Orlando area is made up of the City of Or-
lando and three counties (Orange, with a 
population of almost 850,000; Seminole, 
with a population of over 350,000 and Lake 
with a population of just over 200,000).  By 
2005, the area population is projected to 
grow to over 1.75 million. 
Orlando acquired four (4) TRP-1000s.  Their 
project plan re-deploys three of the units to 
the surrounding counties for their use.  Or-
lando will inspect the units on an annual ba-
sis.  
Orlando installed 800 MHz radios so the 
other jurisdictions would have interoperabil-
ity with Orlando.  They requested a radio 
from each of the other jurisdictions to install 
in the unit they kept to assure interoperabil-
ity with each of the recipient jurisdictions.  
ACU/TRP-1000 Handbook 
Page 5-4 
Orlando configured all the systems before 
sending them out.  Each system currently 
houses a TRP-1000 transportable module 
with five UHF and five VHF radios.  Each 
system has a file that tracks and logs con-
nections, disconnects and any phone num-
bers called as well as date, time and who 
connected or disconnected.  The city has 
also installed two 800 MHz radios, one 470-
512 MHz radio and one Motorola Low Band 
radio. They have Mosaic antennas for the 
UHF and VHF and they have two 800 MHz 
5/8 wave antennas.  
5.2.1 Orlando, Florida TRP-1000 De-
ployment 
Orlando houses the TRP-1000 unit in the 
mobile racks to allow dispatchers to be 
more easily trained at their new communica-
tions center.  They are exploring vehicle de-
ployment options.  
The City is also studying a mobile repeating 
option on a 50-foot tower, with four anten-
nas mounted on an aluminum crossbar.
