User:  company needs to conduct network security penetration testing to discover network security risks. Please provide the corresponding penetration testing tools and methods.
Assistant: Penetration testing tools: 1. Metasploit Framework: It can be used to find and exploit system vulnerabilities and provide rich attack modules. 2. Nmap: for host discovery, port scanning and service identification. 3. Nessus: Can be used for vulnerability scanning and vulnerability exploitation. 4. Burp Suite: for web application vulnerability scanning and attack. 5. Aircrack-ng: Used for wireless network vulnerability scanning and attack. Penetration testing methods: 1. Information collection: collect target information, such as IP address, host name, subnet mask, etc. 2. Scan the network: Use tools to scan the target network to find open services and ports. 3. Vulnerability detection: Use vulnerability scanning tools or manually to find security holes in the target system. 4. Penetration attack: use the found loopholes to try to invade the target system and conduct attack drills. 5. Obtain permissions: Obtain the account password of the target system or escalate the privileges to obtain higher privileges. 6. Maintenance access: Set up backdoors and other methods in the target system so that they can continue to intrude, control the system, or steal data later. 7. Report writing: Based on the results of the penetration test, write a detailed report to back up the penetration test data and methods.
