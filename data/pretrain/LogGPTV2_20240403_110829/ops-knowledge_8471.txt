Question: In a design meeting, a developer proposes a new feature that includes an object to hold aggregated data from multiple sources. The object is expected to have at least ten sub-elements, each of which is a complex object itself. What concerns should be raised regarding the proposed design?
"A": "The proposed design may result in a more efficient and streamlined data processing flow.",
"B": "The high number of complex sub-elements may lead to increased memory consumption and slower data processing.",
"C": "The design is likely to reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities due to the isolated handling of each sub-element.",
"D": "If the code that manages the aggregated object is accessible to attackers, it could be susceptible to performance-related security vulnerabilities."
