 Page de-duplication 
KSM enables the kernel to examine two or more already running programs and compare 
their memory.  If any memory regions or pages are identical, KSM merge them into a 
single page physical page on bare-metal host kernel.

This is useful for virtualization with KVM. Once the guest is running the contents of the 
guest operating  system image can be shared when guests are running the same 
operating system or applications.
