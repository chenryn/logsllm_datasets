User: When deploying the same application on multiple servers, how to ensure the version consistency of the application?
Assistant: The following measures can be taken to ensure the version consistency of the application: 1. Use version control tools for code management, such as Git, SVN, etc., to ensure that all developers use the same branch and synchronize the latest code. 2. Use automated deployment tools, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, etc., to deploy applications uniformly and ensure that the application versions on all servers are consistent. 3. Use container technology, such as Docker, Kubernetes, etc., to package the application as a mirror, and use the same mirror version on all servers to deploy the application. 4. Regularly perform version upgrades and bug fixes to ensure that the application versions on all servers are kept up-to-date and safe. 5. Implement strict release process and code review to ensure that only reviewed code can be deployed to the server.
