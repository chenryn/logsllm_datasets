sets of targeted destination IP addresses of all other scans j from
source S, where i (cid:44) j, and where the Jaccard index is the size of
the intersection of the two sets divided by the size of the union.
We define the maximum of these Jaccard indices as the maximum
similarity value of the scan i. A similarity value of 1 indicates that
a source scanned the exact same set of destination IPs, while a
similarity value of 0 indicates that no single destination IP address
was scanned in a different scan.
Statefulness in repeated scans: Figure 9b shows the maximum
similarity for scans of the different target selection categories. Full
scans do show, necessarily, high maximum similarity values, since
these scans target a vast majority of telescope’s addresses (recall
that we define a full scan as > 150K out of the 178K IPs, hence
the similarity index is not necessarily 1). Also CDN-targeted scans
(which consist of 1.9% of the scans, Table 2) overall have higher
similarity values compared to other partial scans. This observation
supports our hypothesis that most of these scans indeed target
domain names, since the DNS resolutions will sometimes be to the
same CDN server address (and sometimes not, and the level of con-
sistency will vary for different domain names). The most interesting
observation from Figure 9b, however, is the difference between par-
tial Internet-wide and localized scans, which collectively are 98%
of the scans. Internet-wide partial scans show very low similarity
values (only 1% have a value higher than 0.2), evidencing that re-
peated scans by the same source are typically stateless and target
“fresh” sets of random IP addresses instead of targeting the same set
of destinations, e.g., from a hitlist. Localized scans, however, overall
have much higher similarity values: over 30% have a value higher
than 0.2 and 19% have a value higher than 0.6. Thus, sources con-
ducting localized scans are much more likely to repeatedly target
the same address blocks / destination IP addresses, suggesting the
use of either hitlists consisting of addresses or address ranges, or
other forms of stateful scanning strategies.
6.2 Services Scanned
Next, we investigate popular port numbers of our identified scans.
We complement our perspective on port prevalence with one month
of data collected in November 2018 in a /8 darknet (UCSD-NT),
operated by CAIDA/UCSD and available to researchers [2]. We will
further describe and compare the visibility of both vantage points
in more detail in § 7.
CDN vs. UCSD-NT overall ports: Figure 10a shows the top-5
ports, in terms of packets, for our overall dataset (not filtered for
scans), as well as the overall distribution of packets arriving in the
UCSD network telescope. Figure 10b shows the port distribution
for our identified scans. All barplots show the top-5 port numbers
and the percentage of packets contributed. Comparing the overall
port distribution in our dataset against UCSD-NT, Figure 10a, we
notice that the CDN servers log a much higher fraction of UDP
traffic on port 137 and 500 (which we will discuss below). We note,
however, that the UCSD-NT port distribution closely matches the
port distribution of our overall detected scans (top bar in Figure 10b).
Here, 4 of the 5 top ports overlap, with the exception of port 80
(which the CDN telescope does not collect) and port 1433.
Contribution of Internet-wide vs. localized: Note that port 23
(Telnet) and 445 (Remote Desktop Protocol) dominate the overall

out more than one scan during our time period, and some 1.8% of
source IPs carried out more than 10 scans. We see this behavior
relatively uniformly across scan types, with the exception of multi;
in this category more than 20% carried out more than 10 scans.
Measuring scan target similarity: To assess if repeated scans, by
a given source IP, target the same or a similar set of addresses, we
calculate for each scan its maximum similarity, the largest fraction
of destination addresses that a scan shared with any other scan
from the same source IP. In particular, for each scan i carried out
by the same source S, we calculate the Jaccard indices over the

some machines, unsuccessfully, try to establish an IPsec connec-
tion and/or NetBIOS name resolution upon establishing a TCP
connection (see, e.g., reports [4, 5]), we believe that the majority
of these packets do not resemble actual scans or exploits of these
port numbers. A more likely explanation is that these packets are a
connection artifact of hosts that scan/scrape actual websites (e.g.,
Alexa Top 1M), hence accessing other services on our machines,
most likely Web.8
Port co-dependency: We do not restrict our definition of scans
by port number, i.e., a scan can target multiple ports. For 53% of
detected scans, we logged packets on more than a single port num-
