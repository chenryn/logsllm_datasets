I am currently working on a Django project and attempting to use a MySQL backend with Python 2.7. I have installed `mysqldb` and followed the instructions provided in this guide: [http://cd34.com/blog/programming/python/mysql-python-and-snow-leopard/](http://cd34.com/blog/programming/python/mysql-python-and-snow-leopard/).

However, when I try to run the Django project, I encounter the following traceback:

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/andyarmstrong/Documents/workspace/BroadbandMapper/src/BroadbandMapper/manage.py", line 11, in <module>

```

I have also tried the solution suggested in this blog post: [http://whereofwecannotspeak.wordpress.com/2007/11/02/mysqldb-python-module-quirk-in-os-x/](http://whereofwecannotspeak.wordpress.com/2007/11/02/mysqldb-python-module-quirk-in-os-x/), which involves creating a symbolic link to the MySQL library directory, but the issue persists.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this problem?

**Response:**

It appears that the issue is related to the dynamic linker being unable to locate the `libmysqlclient.16.dylib` library. To resolve this, you need to add the path to the MySQL client libraries to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable (not `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, as `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is typically used for Linux systems).

Here are the steps to do this:

1. **Locate the MySQL client library:**
   Find the location of `libmysqlclient.16.dylib`. It is usually located in the `lib` directory of your MySQL installation. For example, it might be in `/usr/local/mysql/lib`.

2. **Add the path to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`:**
   You can add the path to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, etc.).

   Open your shell configuration file in a text editor:
   ```sh
   nano ~/.bash_profile  # or .zshrc, depending on your shell
   ```

   Add the following line to the file:
   ```sh
   export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/mysql/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mysql/lib` with the actual path to the MySQL `lib` directory.

3. **Reload the shell configuration:**
   After saving the file, reload the shell configuration to apply the changes:
   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_profile  # or .zshrc, depending on your shell
   ```

4. **Verify the change:**
   You can verify that the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` has been set correctly by running:
   ```sh
   echo $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

5. **Run your Django project:**
   Try running your Django project again to see if the issue is resolved.

If you continue to experience issues, ensure that the `libmysqlclient.16.dylib` file exists at the specified path and that the file permissions are correct. Additionally, make sure that the version of `mysqldb` you are using is compatible with your MySQL server version.
