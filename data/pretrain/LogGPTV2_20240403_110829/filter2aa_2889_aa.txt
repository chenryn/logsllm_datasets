Abstract Ð An analysis of six cases of unexplained aerial phenomena ob-
served by qualified observers over a twenty-year period in various parts of
the Earth and in known physical conditions yields estimates of optical power
output ranging from a few kilowatts to thousands of megawatts. This paper
surveys the methods by which this parameter can be derived from witnesses’
statements, it discusses the various hypotheses one could propose to account
for the observations and it calls for a broad re-examination of sighting files in
an effort to apply this methodology to a larger sample and to better under-
stand the luminosity characteristics of the reported objects.

Introduction
Some of the most striking statements made by witnesses of unusual aerial ob-
jects during their debriefing by investigators have to do with the luminosity of
the phenomenon. They frequently use expressions like ªit lit up the whole
landscapeº or ªevery object in the area stood out, intensely thrown into relief.º
Beyond these subjective statements (which could be affected by physiological
and psychological factors) it is difficult to obtain reliable quantitative data on
the power output of the observed objects. Typically the witnesses are surprised
by the phenomenon and it is rare for them to have any basis of comparison or
calibration. A few such cases do exist, however, and a special effort has been
made here to derive estimates from the data. 
Obvious cautions are immediately raised by this exercise. By definition the
source of the luminosity is an unknown phenomenon. We do not know if the
light is a primary manifestation of its internal physical state (as would be the
case for the sun) or a secondary one, as would be the case for the moon or an
automobile headlight. We do not even know if most of the electromagnetic en-
ergy is released in the visible domain to which human witnesses and most cam-
eras react.
Given these cautions one can, at best, hope to bracket a physical range to
characterize the phenomenon in question. More relevant than the actual

numerical values obtained in a few cases is the methodology involved in ac-
quiring and processing such parameters.
Case Studies
The cases that follow have been extracted from a larger sample where lumi-
nosity or power output data could be obtained. We have excluded some ex-
treme cases (such as the Tunguska explosion of 1908 in Siberia) and all cases
involving a single observer, leaving six adequately documented and re-
searched incidents with multiple witnesses. In cases no. 2 and 3 the primary
witnesses are known to the author, who has interviewed them personally. In
case no. 4 the author has visited the site. In other cases we rely on the data as-
sembled by qualified investigators, all of whom are known to us.2
Case no. 1:  August 27, 1956. McCleod, Alberta (Canada) Ð 
Classi®cation: MA-13
The witnesses in this MA-1 case are Royal Canadian Air Force pilots who
were flying in a formation of four F-86 Sabre jet aircraft (Figure 1). The planes
were flying at 36,000 ft (about 11 km), headed due west over the Canadian
Rockies, about an hour before sunset.4 As they were approaching a large thun-
derhead R. J. Childerhose, the pilot in the second position (left side of the for-
mation) saw a ªbright light which was sharply defined and disc-shapedº or
ªlike a shiny silver dollar sitting horizontal,º far below the planes but above
the lower layer of clouds. It appeared to be ªconsiderably brighter than the
sunlight.º (Figure 2.)
Sighting duration was variously quoted at 45 seconds (Klass, 1968) to three
minutes. The pilot reported the observation to the flight leader, then took a
photograph of it. That photograph, a Kodachrome color slide, was subse-
quently analyzed by Dr. Bruce Maccabee who considered the hypotheses that
the object was a cloud, a plasma phenomenon, or ball lightning (kugelblitz).
We refer the reader to his detailed study5 while presenting here only a summa-
ry of his arguments.
The cloud hypothesis was contradicted by two facts, namely the equal
brightness of the object on both sides as opposed to the darker appearance of
clouds away from the sunlight, and the fact that portions of the object were
brighter than the brightest clouds.
The plasma or ball lightning hypothesis has been mentioned by Klass
(Klass, 1968) and by Altschuler (Altschuler, 1968). It is contradicted by the
radiance of the object and the duration of the observation. Maccabee derives

sec.  If acting as an isotropic Lambertian radiator, the power output within the spectral
range of the film would have been in excess of 109 W.  (Courtesy of Bruce Maccabee)

the radiance L by solving the standard photographic equation, corrected for the
effects of atmospheric attenuation:
L= 4Ef 2exp[(b±a)/cosq]/Tcos4f
(1)
where
E=H/t .
(2)
H is the film exposure level in J/cm2 and t is the shutter time in seconds. L is
the radiance of the object in the direction of the camera in W/sr/cm2, E is the
irradiance on the focal plane of the camera in W/cm2, and f is the ratio of the
focal length to the diameter, as set by the operator of the camera.  The factor
exp[(b±a)/cosq] corrects for atmospheric attenuation, b being the optical
thickness of the atmosphere from the ground to the altitude of the plane, a the
optical thickness to the altitude of the object and q the zenith angle of the slant
path from the plane to the object.  T is the transmission of the optics (aircraft
window and lens) and f is the angle between the optic axis of the camera and
the optical path from the lens to the image.
We refer the reader to Maccabee’s analysis for an excellent discussion of the
range of values of these parameters. He finds a value between 1.09 and 1.34
for the attenuation correction factor, a value of 0.7 for T, shutter time of 1/125
at f/8 and a value of 0.95 for cos4f. The average density over much of the
image is estimated at 0.12, leading to a value of  H = 10-4 J/cm2.
Inserting these values into (eq. 1) and (eq. 2) gives estimates of radiance of
1.7 to 2.0 W/sr/cm2 if the object was at distances of 6 or 20 kilometers, respec-
tively. Assuming that the object was a Lambertian emitter with constant emit-
tance over its surface, Maccabee finds a range of 2.5 ´ 109 W (2,500
megawatts) to 3 ´ 1010 W (30,000 megawatts) for the power output within the
spectral range of the film. As he rightly points out, however, ªthe total power
emitted over all frequencies might be much greater.º
Case no. 2:  September 1965. Fort-de-France (Martinique) Ð 
Classi®cation: MA-1
On July 1, 1965, two French submarines, the Junon and the Daphn…, escort-
ed by the logistic support vessel Rhône, left the Toulon navy base in the
Mediterranean and sailed toward Gibraltar. The ships traveled first to La Horta
in the Azores, then to Norfolk, Virginia, to conduct a series of joint operations
with the U.S. Navy, which was engaged at the time in the recovery of a Gemini
capsule near Bermuda; the French submarines escorted the aircraft carrier
Wasp. Later the ships went through Hurricane Betsy, whose effects they
avoided by diving to three hundred meters. On the way back to France they
stopped for ten days at Pointe-‚-Pitre, Guadeloupe, and for one day at Saintes
before reaching the island of Martinique, where they anchored in late Septem-
ber 1965.
It was during their layover in Fort-de-France one evening, by a dark sky and
clear weather, that a large luminous object arrived slowly and silently from the
west, flew to the south, made three complete loops in the sky over the French
vessels, and vanished like a rapidly extinguished light bulb (Vallee, 1990).
The person who reported this case to us, Mr. Michel Figuet, was at the time
first timonier (helmsman) of the French fleet of the Mediterranean. He ob-
served the arrival of the object from his position on the deck of the submarine
Junon. He had time to go up to the conning tower, where he took six pairs of
binoculars and distributed them to his companions. There were three hundred
witnesses, including four officers on the Junon, three officers on the Daphn…, a
dozen French sailors, and personnel of the weather observatory.
All witnesses aboard the Junon saw the object as a large ball of light or a
disk on edge arriving from the west at 9:15 p.m. It was the color of a fluores-
cent tube, about the same luminosity as the full moon. It moved slowly, hori-
zontally, at a distance estimated at ten kilometers south of the ships, from west
to east.  It left a whitish trace similar to the glow of a television screen. 
When it was directly south of the ships the object dropped toward the earth,
made two complete loops, then hovered in the midst of a faint ªhalo.º (Figure
3).
Mr. Figuet told the author that he observed the last part of this trajectory
through binoculars; he was able to see two red spots under the disk. Shortly
thereafter, the object vanished in the center of its glow ªlike a bulb turned off.º
The trail and the halo remained visible in the sky for a full minute. At 9:45
p.m. the halo reappeared at the same place, and the object seemed to emerge as

if switched on. It rose, made two more loops and flew away to the west, where
it disappeared at 9:50 p.m. The next day Mr. Figuet compared notes with a
communications engineer who had observed the same object from the Navy
fort. Together, they called the weather observatory at Fort-de-France. The
man who answered the call had also observed the object. He stated that it was
neither an aircraft, nor a rocket.
In 1988 the author was able to interview Michel Figuet in Brussels. He con-
firmed the maneuvers and the appearance of the object and stated that he had
met again with some of the crew members whose recollections of the facts
were equally precise. A landscape illuminated by the full moon receives 0.318
lux, or 1.8 ´ 10-3 W/m2. Since there is agreement among the observers that the
object had approximately the same brightness as the full moon and was situat-
ed about 10 kilometers away, we can compute its total luminosity as:
