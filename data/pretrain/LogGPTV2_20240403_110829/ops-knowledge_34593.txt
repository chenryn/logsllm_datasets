User: I am using Twisted to receive data from a socket.
My protocol class inherits from Protocol.
As there are no byte type in Python 2.*, the type of received data is str.
Of course, len (data) gives me the length of the string but how can I know
the number of bytes received ? There is not sizeof or something equivalent that allows
me to know the number of bytes ? 
Or should I consider that whatever the platform, the number of bytes will be 2 * len (data) ?
thanks in advance
Assistant: The length of the string is the length in bytes.
