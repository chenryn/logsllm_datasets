Assistant: You can use the Shell command ps to view the process startup time and running time. Enter the terminal and enter the following command: ```bash ps -eo pid,etime,time,cmd | grep your_process_name ``` Among them: - pid: process ID - etime: the time from the start of the process to the present - time: the time used by the process CPU time - cmd: In the command line of the process, replace your_process_name with the name of the process you want to query, and you can view the startup time and running time of the process.
