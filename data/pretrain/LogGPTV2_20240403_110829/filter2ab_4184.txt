### ATT&CK Technique: Audit (ID: M1047)

**Description:**
Periodically review the Windows Registry for new and unknown network provider DLLs. Specifically, check the following Registry key:

- **Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetworkProvider\ProviderPath`

**Steps to Ensure Valid Network Provider DLLs:**

1. **Identify Valid Network Provider DLLs:**
   - The names of valid network provider DLLs can be found in the following Registry key:
     - **Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order`
   - Each entry in this key should have a corresponding service subkey that points to a DLL located at:
     - **Path:** `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetworkProvider`

2. **Verify DLLs:**
   - Ensure that only the valid network provider DLLs identified in the `Order` key are registered in the `ProviderPath` key.
   - Any new or unknown DLLs should be investigated and, if necessary, removed to prevent potential security risks.

By regularly auditing these Registry keys, you can help ensure that only legitimate and trusted network provider DLLs are in use, thereby enhancing the security of your system.
