User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Win 7 machine going into sleep like state randomly A colleague of mine uses a Win 7 machine in a server like configuration that runs the security camera software. Now the issue is that this machine for no apparent reason goes into a sleep like state, I say sleep like state because the machine clearly has power and appears to be running but does not react to anything. The software does not run in this state. I checked the Event logs but they just stop at the time the state starts. Getting it back online requires a force shutdown. I assumed it was updates at first but after manually testing by forcing updates the machine seemed to restart just fine. Does anyone know where the fault could be?

Assistant: I had similar problem while running batch jobs that takes a long time in my PC. Usually this can be fixed quickly by reviewing the power settings. 

A quick workaround if you dont wana mess up with the power setting is play a video/movie in a loop.
My company doesnt allows movies so i use the default video sample under - "C:\Users\Public\Videos\Sample Videos" and that keeps the PC in active mode always untill i manually shut it down... 
hope that helps :)
