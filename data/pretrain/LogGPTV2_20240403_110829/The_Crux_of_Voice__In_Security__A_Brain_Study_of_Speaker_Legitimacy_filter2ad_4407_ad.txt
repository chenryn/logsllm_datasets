Similarly, on contrasting changes in mean-oxy and mean-
deoxy at different ROIs between the morphed speaker and
the rest trial using WSRT, we noticed statistically signiﬁcant
differences in oxy-Hb at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
frontopolar area, and superior temporal gyrus (Table VII,
rows 1-3 and Figure 5(b)). Also, at frontopolar area, superior
temporal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus, statistically signif-
icant differences in deoxy-Hb were observed for the morphed
speaker than in the rest trial (Table VII, rows 4-6).

and mean deoxy-Hb between the different speaker trial and
the rest trial at various regions of interest revealed statistically
signiﬁcant differences in oxy-Hb at dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontopolar area, superior temporal gyrus, middle tem-
poral gyrus and orbitofrontal gyrus for different speaker trial
than in the rest trial (Table VIII, rows 1-5 and Figure 5(c)).
It also rendered statistically signiﬁcant differences in deoxy-
Hb at dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontopolar area, middle
temporal gyrus, and orbitofrontal area for the different speaker
trial compared to the rest trial (Table VIII, rows 4-6).
Interpretation: Listening, attention and decision-making are
critical components of higher cognitive function. The detection
of voice impersonation attacks in our study involves all these
elements in helping participants ﬁgure out the original and
the fake voices of the speakers. The statistically signiﬁcant
activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the frontopolar
area at the neural level (Tables VI, VIII and VII) is indica-
tive of the involvement of working memory and executive
cognitive functions in this task. The previous studies [5],
[13] have found interaction among the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontopolar area and orbitofrontal area to play a critical
role in conﬂict-dependent decision-making. The activation in
orbitofrontal area portrays that the participants were being
suspicious while identifying the different voices presented to
them. They were sometimes trusting the voice of the real
speaker as real and sometimes distrusting the voice as fake.
A study by Dimoka et al. [15] found that trust was associated
with lower activation in orbitofrontal area. The activation in
orbitofrontal cortex is observed only when users are listening
to voice of different speaker indicating that they were being
suspicious when they were asked to identify different speaker’s
voice sample. This level of suspicion is also reﬂected in the
behavioral results where participants were able to detect the
different speakers much better than the morphed speakers. The
9
activation in superior temporal gyrus and middle temporal
gyrus, related to auditory processing [43], shows that
the
participants were carefully processing the voice of the speakers
to decide their legitimacy. This shows that the participants were
actively trying to decide if the given voice was real or fake.
B. Speaker Legitimacy Analysis
Now we present the results of contrasting neural activations
between the original speaker and fake speakers (i.e.,
the
morphed speaker and the different speaker). These compar-
isons of the brain activities delineate the brain areas involved
in processing the voices of original and morphed speakers
(synthesized voices), and original and different speakers. To
recall, the different speaker scenario is used as a baseline to
study the morphed speaker scenario.
Contrast 1: Original Speaker vs. Morphed Voice: This anal-
ysis provides an understanding of how the original speaker’s
voice and morphed speaker’s voices are perceived by the
human brain. To recall, our experimental task had four victim
speakers. All these speakers were familiarized to participants
during the experiment. In this analysis, we examined the neural
activities when participants were listening to all original speak-
ers and all morphed speakers. For the same, we ran WSRT at
different ROIs to evaluate the differences in mean oxy-Hb, and
deoxy-Hb between original and morphed voice. However, we
did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant differences.
Contrast 2: Original Speaker vs. Different Speaker: In this
analysis, we compared the neural metrics when participants
were listening to the voice of original speaker vs. the voice of
a different speaker. We hypothesized that the original speakers
– since they were familiarized to participants – will produce
different neural activations than the different speakers.
For this analysis, we applied WSRT to contrast the mean
oxy-Hb and mean deoxy-Hb at different ROIs between all
the voices of original speaker and the voices of different
speaker. It revealed statistically signiﬁcant differences in oxy-
Hb for original speaker than different speaker at superior
temporal gyrus (p=.029) with medium effect size (r=.48).
These differences are visualized in Figure 6.
We also applied WSRT to contrast
the neural activity
for original and different speakers’ voices only corresponding
to the samples correctly identiﬁed by the participants per
their behavioral response. We observed statistically signiﬁcant
differences at superior temporal gyrus (p<.05).
trials compared to rest trials on WSRT, we observed differ-
ences in oxy-Hb in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontopolar
area, orbitofrontal area, middle temporal gyrus, and superior
temporal gyrus (all p-values less than p<.05). These areas of
brain are activated in decision making, familiarity analysis, and
real-fake judgment (detailed interpretation presented in Section
VI-A).
We also compared the neural activation when female par-
ticipants were listening to real and morphed voices of a speaker
and did not observe any statistically signiﬁcantly different
result. Similarly, we did not observe any statistically signiﬁcant
difference in neural activation when male participants were
listening to real and morphed voices. This suggests that users
maybe biologically susceptible to fake voices irrespective of
their gender.
D. Familiarity-based Speaker Legitimacy Analysis
To recall, we had polled the participants’ about their famil-
iarity with the two famous celebrities in our pre-test question-
naire. We compared the brain activities when participants were
listening to the famous speakers’ original samples to the brieﬂy
familiar speakers’ original samples. This helped us understand
the differences in neural activations when participants heard
long-term familiarized voices vs. brieﬂy-familiarized voices.
We performed WSRT in mean oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb between
the original
trials of the famous speakers and the brieﬂy
familiar speakers at different ROIs. We observed statistically
signiﬁcantly higher deoxy-Hb at frontopolar area (p=.031)
with medium effect size (r=.48) and middle temporal gyrus
(p=.005) with large effect size (r=.63). These differences have
been depicted in Figure 7.
Fig. 7.
Statistically signiﬁcantly higher deoxy-Hb observed in middle
temporal gyrus (MTG) and frontopolar area (FPA) when participants were
listening to the voice of familiar speaker compared to the unfamiliar speaker.
Interpretation: The famous speakers were previously known
to the participants, so their voice prints might have resided
in the long-term memory. The higher activation in frontopolar
area for famous speakers compared to brieﬂy familiar speakers
showed that the users were using their memory to identify the
original voice samples. Similarly, we also saw higher activa-
tion in middle temporal gyrus for famous speakers voice in
comparison to brieﬂy familiar speakers. The middle temporal
gyrus has been found to be more activated for familiar voices
in previous studies [7]. Overall, these results illustrate that
the human brain processes familiar voices differently from the
unfamiliar voices.

Fig. 6. Statistically signiﬁcantly higher oxy-Hb observed in superior temporal
gyrus (STG) when participants were listening to the voice of original speakers
compared to the voice of the different speaker.
Interpretation of Contrasts 1 and 2: Based on the results
of prior real vs. fake website/painting detection studies [25],
[32]–[34], we expected to see differences in neural activity
corresponding to real vs. morphed voices. However, contrary
to our hypothesis, our results do not reveal such differences,
which suggests that the original voices may have sounded
identical to the morphed voices. This insight is also captured
in our behavioral
task performance analysis (Section V),
and serves well to explain the users’ susceptibility to voice
morphing attacks.
Unlike original vs morphed analysis, we observed statis-
tically signiﬁcant differences in neural activities at superior
temporal gyrus when users were listening to voices of original
speakers vs. different speakers. The superior temporal gyrus
is found to be activated for familiar voices in previous neuro-
science studies [7] (the original speaker voices are the familiar
voices in our case). Given this difference in neural activation,
it is justiﬁed that the users were able to identify the different
speakers in our voice impersonation attacks a large majority
of times (Section V).
Overall, we see that users’ brain activation explains why
people were not able to detect the morphed speakers while they
could detect the different speaker reasonably well, as shown
in the task performance results.
C. Gender-based Speaker Legitimacy Analysis
Since gender may play some role in the detection of
original, different and morphed voices, we pursued gender-
centric analysis from our dataset. In this analysis, we divided
our datasets into two categories based on the gender of the
participants – male and female. We had 10 male and 10 female
participants in our study. We ﬁrst performed analysis on each
category of participants to understand how they react to real,
morphed and different voices compared to rest. Similar to
our analysis in Section VI-A, on using WSRT, we observed
differences in oxy-Hb in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, fron-
topolar area, middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal
gyrus between original voice trails and rest trials (all p-values
less than p<.05) for both male and female participants. We
also observed differences in oxy-Hb at dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex, frontopolar area, and superior temporal gyrus between
morphed and rest for both male and female participants (all p-
values less than p<.05). Similarly, for different speakers’ voice

CLASSIFICATION
In the previous section, we observed that the neural activity
in original vs. morphed speakers was not statistically signiﬁ-
cantly different. In this section, to further validate this result,
we show that the machine-learning on neural data can also not
help classify these differences.
A. Feature and Performance Metrics
For extracting features, we normalized the oxy-Hb and
deoxy-Hb data in each region of interest using z-score nor-
malization. Next, at each ROI, we computed maximum, mini-
mum, average, standard deviation, slope, variation, skew, and
kurtoisis for the normalized oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb data for
each trial as features. We computed these features separately
for the ﬁrst and second half of each 15 second long task. We
also separated the 15 seconds of data into 3 segments, and we
took the average value of each of these 3 segments for the
oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb datastreams. We had one feature vector
for each trial.
To build classiﬁcation models, we utilized off-the-shelf
machine learning algorithms provided by Weka. To this end,
we used 10-fold cross-validation for estimation and validation
of the models built on different algorithms including: Trees –
J48, Logistic Model Trees (LMT), Random Forest (RF) and
Random Tree (RT); Functions – Neural Networks, Multilayer
Perceptron (MP), Support Vector Machines (SMO), Logistics
(L) and Simple Logistic (SL), and Bayesian Networks – Naive
Bayes (NB).
As performance measures, we report the precision (P rec),
recall (Rec), F-measure (F M) or F1 Score for machine
learning classiﬁcation models. P rec refers to the accuracy
of the system in rejecting negative classes and measures the
security of the proposed system. Rec is the accuracy of the
system in accepting positive classes and measures the usability
of the proposed system. Low recall leads to high rejection of
positive instances, hence unusable, and low precision leads to
high acceptance of negative instances, hence insecure. F M
represents the balance between precision and recall.
True positive (TP) represents the total number of correctly
identiﬁed instances belonging to the positive class while true
negative(TN) is the number correctly rejected instances of
negative class. Similarly, false positive (FP) is the number of
negative instances incorrectly accepted as positive class and
false negative (FN) represents the number of times the positive
class is rejected.
B. Speaker Legitimacy Detection Accuracies
Our statistical analysis of neural data related to original
speaker, morphed speaker voices showed some, albeit minimal,
signiﬁcant differences in oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb. Taking this
into account, we extracted features from these underlying
neural differences and built a 2-class classiﬁers as discussed
in Section VII-A to identify original and morphed speakers.
In this classiﬁcation task, the positive class corresponds to
original speaker and negative class corresponds to the mor-
phed. For the speaker legitimacy detection, we observed that
none of the classiﬁers performed well. The best F-measure of
identifying the voice of morphed speaker vs. original speaker
obtained was 53% (see Table IX). To improve the results, we
also evaluated the classiﬁcation model with the best subset of
features selected using correlation-based feature selection al-
gorithm [22], and the best F-measure we achieved was 56.2%.
We did not see statistically signiﬁcant difference in these F-
measures when compared to those of human detection and
random guessing. These results show that, similar to human
behavioral performance, even neural patterns and machine
learning may not be successful to identify voice impersonation
attacks.
