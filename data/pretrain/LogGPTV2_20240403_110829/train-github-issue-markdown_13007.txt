I created a sql metric with the expression:
    CAST(strftime("%s", max("timestamp")) AS INT)
When I used this metric to create a table view the values were not being
populated. Looking into the JSON I found the query had duplicated the `%`:
    query: "SELECT "serviceName" AS "serviceName", CAST(strftime("%%s", max("timestamp")) AS INT)
     AS latest_date FROM "testResults" WHERE timestamp >= '2016-03-29 15:57:43.000000' AND timestamp <= '2016-04-05 15:57:43.000000' GROUP BY "serviceName" ORDER BY 
    CAST(strftime("%%s", max("timestamp")) AS INT) DESC LIMIT 50000 OFFSET 0"
Current end result is this column ends up displaying a 0 for each entry
