A Comparison protocols
A.1 Comparison with unencrypted inputs
Our protocol for comparing with encrypted inputs is Protocol 7 and here is some intuition. We follow the main idea
from Veugen [Veu11] (found in Section 2.1): compute 2l + b − a (over encrypted data) and check the l + 1-th bit (the
bit corresponding to the power 2l). If it is 1, it means that b ≥ a, else b < a.
We also assume that the encryption scheme is additively homomorphic. In [Veu11] (Section 2.1), Veugen presents a
solution for a similar problem except that A only gets the encrypted bit, not in the clear. So we modify his protocol in
Protocol 7.
In the description of protocol 7, N is the modulus associated with Paillier’s cryptosystem.
Protocol 7 Comparing encrypted data
Input A:(cid:74)a(cid:75) and(cid:74)b(cid:75), the bit length l of a and b, the secret key SKQR, public key PKP
Input B:Secret key SKP , public key PKQR, the bit length l
Output A:(a ≤ b)
1: A:(cid:74)x(cid:75) ←(cid:74)b(cid:75) ·(cid:74)2l(cid:75) ·(cid:74)a(cid:75)−1 mod N 2
3: A:(cid:74)z(cid:75) ←(cid:74)x(cid:75) ·(cid:74)r(cid:75) mod N 2
2: A chooses a random number r ← (0, 2λ+l) ∩ Z
4: A sends(cid:74)z(cid:75) to B
5: B decrypts(cid:74)z(cid:75)
6: A: c ← r mod 2l
7: B: d ← z mod 2l
8: With A, B privately computes the encrypted bit [t(cid:48)] such that t = (d < c) using DGK
9: A encrypts rl and sends [rl] to B
10: B encrypts zl
11: B: [t] ← [t(cid:48)] · [zl] · [rl]
12: B: sends [t] to A
13: A decrypts and outputs t
(cid:46) Blind x
We will show the correctness of the protocol and then give a proof of security in the honest-but-curious model using
modular composition. For the correctness, we just modify the proof of [Veu11].
Proposition A.1. Protocol 7 is correct and secure in the honest-but-curious model.
See proof in Appendix C.
A.2 Reversed encrypted comparison
We constructed Protocol 8 which is the same as Protocol 7, except that the roles of A and B are exchanged in Steps 8– 13.
24
Proposition A.2. Protocol 8 is secure in the honest-but-curious model.
The proof is in Appendix C.
Protocol 8 Reversed comparing encrypted data
Input A:(cid:74)a(cid:75) and(cid:74)b(cid:75), public keys PKQR and PKP
Input B:Secret keys SKP and SKQR
Output B:(a ≤ b)
Run Steps 1– 7 of Protocol 7.
8: With B, A privately computes the encrypted bit [t(cid:48)] such that t(cid:48) = (d < c) using DGK
9: B encrypts zl and sends [zl] to A
10: A encrypts rl
11: A: [t] ← [t(cid:48)] · [zl] · [rl]
12: A: sends [t] to B
13: B decrypts and outputs t
B Preliminaries for proofs
B.1 Secure two-party computation framework
All our protocols are two-party protocols, which we label as party A and party B. In order to show that they do private
computations, we work in the honest-but-curious (semi-honest) model as described in [Gol04].
1 , . . . , mA
Let f = (fA, fB) be a (probabilistic) polynomial function and Π a protocol computing f. A and B want to
compute f (a, b) where a is A’s input and b is B’s input, using Π and with the security parameter λ. The view of
party A during the execution of Π is the tuple VA(λ, a, b) = (1λ; a; rA; mA
t ) where r is A’s random tape
t are the messages received by A. We deﬁne the view of B similarly. We also deﬁne the outputs of
and mA
parties A and B for the execution of Π on input (a.b) as OutputΠ
B(λ, a, b), and the global output
as OutputΠ(λ, a, b) = (OutputΠ
A(λ, a, b) and OutputΠ
1 , . . . , mA
A(λ, a, b), OutputΠ
B(λ, a, b)).
To ensure security, we have to show that whatever A can compute from its interactions with B can be computed
from its input and output, which leads us to the following security deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition B.1. The two-party protocol Π securely computes the function f if there exists two probabilistic polynomial
time algorithms SA and SB such that for every possible input a, b of f,
{SA(1λ,a, fA(a, b)), f (a, b)} ≡c
and
{VA(λ, a, b), OutputΠ(λ, a, b)}
{SB(1λ,a, fB(a, b)), f (a, b)} ≡c
{VB(λ, a, b), OutputΠ(λ, a, b)}
where ≡c means computational indistinguishability against probabilistic polynomial time adversaries with negligible
