### Steps to reproduce
When the parent style is scoped the `` will lost the style of the first
tag if other tags on component has a selector with v-if.
Example:
Main.vue:
Test.vue
Open it on Chrome, and no style set on class `test` but I have set it on
`Main.vue`.  
If I remove `class="..."` or remove `v-if="f"` on `Test.vue` then the class
`test` will set..
Is it that I lost something to know in using ``?
Thanks.
### What is expected?
No lost style.
### What is actually happening?
No Style set on the first tag.
