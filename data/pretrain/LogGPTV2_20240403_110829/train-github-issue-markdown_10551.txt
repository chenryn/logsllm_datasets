##### System information (version)
Using the cv2 libraray in a python3.6 application, when I try to set the
preferable target to CUDA using the line
`cv.dnn_Net.setPreferableTarget(cv.dnn.DNN_TARGET_CUDA)` I get the following
error;
    TypeError: descriptor 'setPreferableTarget' requires a 'cv2.dnn_Net' object but received a 'int'
I followed the 4.2 docs when determing the object to use when setting the
target.
Can't really determine if it's a bug or silly mistake.Everything else runs
without issue.
