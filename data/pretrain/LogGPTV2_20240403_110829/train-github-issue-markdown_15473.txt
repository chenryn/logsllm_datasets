##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
Ansible core
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.2.1.0
##### CONFIGURATION
deafult, installed from Ansible ppa
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
N/A
##### SUMMARY
Looks like new version of Ansible 2.2.1 fails in some cases when processing
playbooks and templates  
that have quotation  
Previous version 2.2.0 works fine
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
this is from Kargo playbook, ansible playbook to install Kubernetes  
works with Ansible 2.2.0 and fails with 2.2.1
    - name: Register docker images info
      shell: "{{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker images -q | xargs {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker inspect -f {% raw %}'{{.RepoTags}},{{.RepoDigests}}'{% endraw %}"
      register: docker_images_raw
      failed_when: false
      when: not download_always_pull|bool
this works for 2.2.1
    - name: Register docker images info
      raw: >-
        {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker images -q | xargs {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker inspect -f "{{ '{{' }} .RepoTags {{ '}}' }},{{ '{{' }} .RepoDigests {{ '}}' }}"
      register: docker_images_raw
      failed_when: false
      when: not download_always_pull|bool
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
At least some notes to Release Notes for 2.2.1 changes about quotation
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
I have automatic installation of Ansible from PPA, but with new version my
roles are completely broken  
and need to be reviewed/refactored.  
Moreover, 2.2.0 is removed from PPA, so for me it is really disaster and work
stopper.
Can you please put 2.2.0 back in PPA and PLEASE note in case of such
significant changes.
Thanks!
