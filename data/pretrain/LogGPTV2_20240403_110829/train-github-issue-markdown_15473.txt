### Issue Type
- Bug Report

### Component Name
- Ansible Core

### Ansible Version
- 2.2.1.0

### Configuration
- Default, installed from the Ansible PPA

### OS / Environment
- N/A

### Summary
It appears that the new version of Ansible (2.2.1) is failing in some cases when processing playbooks and templates that use quotation marks. The previous version (2.2.0) works fine.

### Steps to Reproduce
This issue occurs in a Kargo playbook, which is an Ansible playbook used to install Kubernetes. The following task works with Ansible 2.2.0 but fails with 2.2.1:

```yaml
- name: Register docker images info
  shell: "{{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker images -q | xargs {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker inspect -f {% raw %}'{{.RepoTags}},{{.RepoDigests}}'{% endraw %}"
  register: docker_images_raw
  failed_when: false
  when: not download_always_pull|bool
```

To make it work with 2.2.1, the `shell` module needs to be replaced with the `raw` module, as shown below:

```yaml
- name: Register docker images info
  raw: >-
    {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker images -q | xargs {{ docker_bin_dir }}/docker inspect -f "{{ '{{' }} .RepoTags {{ '}}' }},{{ '{{' }} .RepoDigests {{ '}}' }}"
  register: docker_images_raw
  failed_when: false
  when: not download_always_pull|bool
```

### Expected Results
- At least some notes in the release notes for Ansible 2.2.1 regarding the changes in handling quotation marks.

### Actual Results
- I have an automatic installation of Ansible from the PPA, and with the new version, my roles are completely broken and need to be reviewed and refactored.
- Additionally, version 2.2.0 has been removed from the PPA, making this a significant disruption to my work.
- Can you please reinstate version 2.2.0 in the PPA and ensure that such significant changes are noted in future releases?

Thank you!
