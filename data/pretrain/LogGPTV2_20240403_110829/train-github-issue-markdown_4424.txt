### Environment
- **Windows Build Number:** Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1069]
- **PowerToys Version:** 0.13.0

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Ensure that FancyZones is already set up on the remote computer (the one you are connecting to).
2. Initiate a remote connection using the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) - the native Windows application.
3. Attempt to move windows using keyboard shortcuts.

### Expected Behavior
- FancyZones should recognize and function properly within the RDC session, allowing windows to be moved to pre-configured zones using the `Win + Arrow` keys.

### Actual Behavior
- The `Win + Arrow` keys do not move windows to the pre-configured zones in the RDC session.
