**Code Snippet**
Help us help you! Put down a short code snippet that illustrates your bug and  
that we can run and debug locally. For example:
    //config.js
    outputDir: 'src/tests/e2e/test-results',
    use: {
     screenshot: 'on',
    },
    reporter: [
      ['html', { open: 'never', outputFolder: 'src/tests/e2e/test-results' }],
    ],
**Describe the bug**  
As noticed in the above config, I want test artifacts and html report to be in
the same directory.
When I run the tests locally, it generates the `index.html` only and
screenshot isn't saved.  
When I run the tests on Docker (using volume mount), it generates the
`index.html` as well as screenshots are saved.
Wondering why this is the case?
