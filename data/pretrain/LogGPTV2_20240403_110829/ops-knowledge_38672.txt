Question: "In the OKWS system, each service is identified with a unique 20-byte token to communicate with the dbproxy. Analyze the security design related to these 20-byte tokens. Which of the following statements accurately reflect the pros and cons or potential vulnerabilities associated with this token system?"
 "A": "If a service's token is disclosed, an attacker can immediately make unauthorized queries to the database using the compromised service's identity."
 "B": "The tokens are supplied in RPC when services communicate with dbproxy, mitigating the risk of SQL injection by limiting direct SQL query access."
 "C": "A disclosed token does not pose an immediate problem, but if any service is compromised, the attacker can exploit the token to access users' data related to that service."
 "D": "The token system is ineffective because an attacker can easily guess the 20-byte token due to its insufficient length and complexity."
