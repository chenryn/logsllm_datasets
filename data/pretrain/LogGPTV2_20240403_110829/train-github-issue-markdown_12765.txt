It is hard to get the zone to the correct position and correct size with the
mouse.
It would be great if we get a edit button left of the close button. There i
want to put in the position (x pos, y pos) and the size (width, height) - like
in the program WindowManager.
Also it would be great if there is a grab/pick button, where i can choose a
existing window to get the coordinates from it.
And also that i can setup a shortcut for this zone (like Ctrl+Alt+F1) to send
the active window directly to this zone without mouse
And it would be also great, if i can see and setup there the position nr. of
the zone (the dots you see when you drag a window with shift).
