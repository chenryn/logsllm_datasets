When attempting to set up a cluster using the new Multiple-AZ Support on AWS, the process fails after successfully launching the first part of the cluster. The second set of nodes cannot be brought up. Below is the configuration used to start the cluster:

1. The following command, which launches the initial part of the cluster, succeeds:
   ```bash
   export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws
   KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-2a kube-up.sh
   ```

2. However, the subsequent command, intended to bring up the second set of nodes, fails with the error message: "Could not detect Kubernetes master node IP. Make sure you've launched a cluster with 'kube-up.sh'":
   ```bash
   KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-2b KUBE_SUBNET_CIDR=172.20.1.0/24 KUBE_USE_EXISTING_MASTER=true kube-up.sh
   ```

The log detailing the failure to launch the second set of nodes is as follows:

Your cluster is unlikely to work correctly.
Please run ./cluster/kube-down.sh and re-create the cluster. (sorry!)
```

This indicates that the cluster is not functioning properly, and it is recommended to tear down the existing cluster and attempt to recreate it.
