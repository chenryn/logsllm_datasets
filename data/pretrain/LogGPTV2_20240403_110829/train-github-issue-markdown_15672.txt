Bringing up a cluster using the new Multiple-AZ Support fails on AWS. The
first part of the cluster comes up but we fail on bringing up the second set
of nodes. Below is the config to start up:
    # this part succeeds
    export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=aws
    KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-2a kube-up.sh
    # this command fails with: Could not detect Kubernetes master node IP.  Make sure you've launched a cluster with 'kube-up.sh'
    KUBE_AWS_ZONE=us-west-2b KUBE_SUBNET_CIDR=172.20.1.0/24 KUBE_USE_EXISTING_MASTER=true kube-up.sh
And here is the log of the failure to bring up the second set of nodes:

     0 minions started; waiting
     0 minions started; waiting

    Your cluster is unlikely to work correctly.
    Please run ./cluster/kube-down.sh and re-create the
    cluster. (sorry!)
