# Environment
    Windows build number: 19041.329
    PowerToys version: v0.18.2
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys Run
# Steps to reproduce
  1. Open PowerToys.
  2. Make sure _PowerToys Run_ is enabled.
  3. Restart PowerToys.
  4. Look carefully at the screen. A glitch (probably the foreground of the search bar) will appear that will last less than half a second. You can see better on a white background.
Or,
  1. Open PowerToys.
  2. Disable _PowerToys Run_.
  3. Enable _PowerToys Run_.
  4. Wait for the glitch.
# Expected behavior
There shouldn't be any glitch when opening PowerToys. It might be annoying,
and distracting, especially if you set PowerToys to launch at startup.
# Actual behavior
When PowerToys is launched, or _PowerToys Run_ is enabled, a glitch that
contains the parts of the search bar, appears, and then disappears in a
fraction of a second. This gives an unpleasant user experience.
