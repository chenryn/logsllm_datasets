### Version
2.6.11
### Reproduction link
https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-
sammet-51l0g?file=/src/components/HelloWorld.vue
### Steps to reproduce
I have template code like below, and I have set vue-loader's option
`compilerOptions.whitespace = "condense"`;
          {{ msg }}
### What is expected?
no whitespace output between `` and `{{ msg }}`.
### What is actually happening?
"vue-template-compiler" removed whitespace between HTML tags, but left
whitespaces around `{{msg}}`, which causes my button a bit wider than
expected.

Would you please provider another option for `whitespace`, which can remove
whitespaces between tags and Mustache?
