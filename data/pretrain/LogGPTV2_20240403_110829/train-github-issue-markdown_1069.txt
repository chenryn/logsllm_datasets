Please allow terminal to run scripts at startup from a task bar jump list.
What would be nice is having the Windows Terminal jump list provide a list of
startup scripts, same way VS allows me to open projects form the jump list. I
could pull up the jump list from the task bar and select whichever project I
was working on. For example I could select a script from the jump list to take
me to a particular working directory and setup command line compilation for
the terminal instance.
