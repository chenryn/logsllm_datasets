## Expected Behavior
If a user happens to request an old bundle resource with an old hash, the
response should 404, not 500.
## Current Behavior
I'm currently running a Next.js app at https://www.tenable.com/plugins and I'm
getting quite a few 500 errors in my logs after I deploy a new version that
has a new hash from the build (I'm using sticky sessions to minimize the
disruption, but still see some errors long after the deploy).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
**200** -> https://custom-server-koa-
wxksegmzhf.now.sh/_next/7c048a193f99703d6180e88866b6e06b/app.js
**500 Internal server error** -> https://custom-server-koa-
wxksegmzhf.now.sh/_next/OLD_HASH_VALUE/app.js

## Context
Just trying to minimize the number of unneeded 500 errors ðŸ˜„
Appreciate all your work and effort!
