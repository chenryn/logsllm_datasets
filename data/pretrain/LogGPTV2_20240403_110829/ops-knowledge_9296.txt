User: How to implement containerized deployment on the server, including Docker, Kubernetes, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Docker deployment: a. Install Docker Engine b. Write Dockerfile and configuration file c. Build Docker image d. Run Docker container 2. Kubernetes deployment: a. Install Kubernetes cluster b. Write resource lists such as Kubernetes Deployment and Service c. Submit Kubernetes resource list file d. The specific steps for running the Kubernetes service are as follows: Docker deployment: a. Install Docker Engine Install Docker Engine on the server. The official installation script provided by Docker can automatically install Docker Engine. For details, please refer to the official document: https:// docs.docker.com/engine/install/ b. Write Dockerfile and configuration file Write Dockerfile to define the building rules of Docker image. At the same time, modify the Docker configuration file according to the special requirements of the current system environment to ensure that the Docker Engine runs normally. c. Build a Docker image Run the docker build command under the path where the Dockerfile is located to build a Docker image. d. Run the Docker container On the basis of the built Docker image, run the docker run command to start the Docker container to complete the containerized deployment. Kubernetes deployment: a. Installing a Kubernetes cluster Kubernetes officially provides multiple ways to install a Kubernetes cluster. For example, use the kubeadm tool to quickly build a Kubernetes cluster. Detailed documentation can be found on the official website: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/ b . Write Kubernetes Deployment and Service and other resource lists Write Kubernetes Deployment and Service lists, define the deployment rules for required applications, and load balancing services for applications. c. Submit the Kubernetes resource manifest file Use the kubectl tool to submit the Kubernetes resource manifest file and create Kubernetes resource objects such as Deployment and Service. d. Run the Kubernetes service In the configured cluster, use the kubectl command to run the Deployment and Service resource objects to complete the containerized deployment of the application and the deployment of the Kubernetes service with features such as high availability and elastic expansion and contraction.
