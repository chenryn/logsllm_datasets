# Description of the new feature/enhancement
Moving profiles.json to C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\WindowsTerminal would
allow it to make use of the Roaming folder, and also put it in an easier and
more consistent place for people to create symlinks to sync it across several
machines using OneDrive/Google Drive/NextCloud/etc.
