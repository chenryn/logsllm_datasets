### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

Relocating the `profiles.json` file to `C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Roaming\WindowsTerminal` would enable it to utilize the Roaming folder. This change would also provide a more accessible and consistent location for users to create symbolic links, facilitating the synchronization of the file across multiple machines using services such as OneDrive, Google Drive, or NextCloud.

This enhancement would improve the user experience by ensuring that terminal settings are consistently available and up-to-date across different devices.
