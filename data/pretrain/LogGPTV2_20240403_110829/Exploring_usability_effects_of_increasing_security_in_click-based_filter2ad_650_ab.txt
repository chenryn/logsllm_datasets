For durations, we took the mean of successful password en-
try times for each user. For errors, we again calculated the
mean number of errors for successful password entries.
To test hypotheses 1(a) and 1(b), statistical tests evalu-
ating for main eﬀects of number of click-points and image
size were necessary. For statistical tests exploring the ef-
fect of number of click-points, we created three distributions
grouped on the number of click-points and ignoring image
size (i.e., one distribution combining S5 and L5 data, one
including S6 and L6, and one including S7 and L7). Sim-
ilarly, to explore the eﬀect of image size, we created two
distributions based solely on image size (i.e., one distribu-
g
tion including S5, S6, and S7, and one distribution including
L5, L6, and L7).

4.1 Success Rates
We report success rates at three diﬀerent levels: ﬁrst time
success, success within three attempts, and eventual success.
First time success occurs when the password is entered cor-
rectly on the ﬁrst attempt, with no mistakes or restarts.
Success rates within three attempts indicate that fewer than
three mistakes or restarts occurred. Eventual success rates
indicate that the participant made multiple attempts, but
was eventually successful. Mistakes occur when the partic-
ipant presses the Login button but the password entry is

password entry. They are analogous to pressing delete while
entering text, except that PCCP’s implicit feedback helps
users detect and correct mistakes during login.
Success rates were examined for the login, recall-1 and
recall-2 phases. For hypotheses 1(a) and 1(b), linear re-
gressions were used to look for signiﬁcant eﬀects of num-
ber of click-points and image size.
In hypothesis 2, we
used Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) tests to compare the dis-
tributions of the conditions with similar levels of security.
Wilcoxon tests are similar to independent sample t-tests,
but make no assumptions about the distributions of the
compared samples, which is appropriate to the count data
in these individual conditions. During the ﬁrst session (lo-
gin and recall-1), we consider success on ﬁrst attempt to be
the most important measure of success since users’ memory
of the password will still be fresh. For recall-2, occurring
after two weeks, we consider success within 3 attempts as
the most appropriate measure since it most closely reﬂects
account lockout practices for real systems. Results of statis-
tical tests in this section are based these two choices.
Table 3 reports success rates for the login, recall-1 and
recall-2 phases. Success rates were very high in Session 1,
indicating that participants were very successful at remem-
bering their passwords after a short time period. Success
rates after two weeks were much lower, reﬂecting the diﬃ-
culty of the memory task. For clarity, Table 3 shows per-
centages, but the statistical tests were based on the count of
successes per user over the six accounts, yielding a number
from 0 to 6. Figure 4 shows boxplots indicating the ranges
of these counts, distinguishing the diﬀerent ranges by both
click-points and image sizes. Table 4 shows the results of sta-
tistical tests using regression to determine whether the dif-
ferences between the ranges might have occurred by chance.
Hypothesis 1(a): Table 4 shows that in Session 1, nei-
ther the login or recall-1 phases showed any signiﬁcant ef-
fects for the number of click-points. For recall-2, there was a
signiﬁcant eﬀect of number of click-points (p = 0.043) when
considering success within three attempts. This evidence
supports hypothesis 1(a) with respect to success rates.
Hypothesis 1(b): As shown in Table 4, varying the im-
age size did not lead to any signiﬁcant eﬀects in the login
or recall-1 phases. In the recall-2 phase, there was a signiﬁ-
cant eﬀect of image size (p = 0.017). This evidence supports
hypothesis 1(b) with respect to success rates.
Hypothesis 2: Wilcoxon tests showed no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between S6 and L5 in any phase. Similarly, no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in success rates were found between
S7 and L6. Therefore, we have no evidence that having a
larger image or more click-points had a larger impact on
participants’ ability to remember their passwords, oﬀering
participants’ ability to remember their passwords, oﬀering

4.2 Times
Times were measured for each password entry from when
the ﬁrst image appeared on the screen until the participant
successfully logged in. This included the time to enter their
username, as well as any time making mistakes (pressing
the login button and having the system say that the pass-
word is incorrect) or resulting from restarts (analogous to
pressing the backspace key when entering a text password).
All eventually successful password attempts were included
83
in the time calculations. We ran two-way ANOVAs to ex-
amine the main eﬀects of number of click-points and image
size. ANOVAs compare variance of the means for multiple
samples and identify whether any of the samples are likely
to come from diﬀerent distributions. We used independent
samples t-tests to test for signiﬁcant diﬀerences in times be-
tween S6 and L5, and between S7 and L6. These tests com-
pare variance of the means between two distributions.
Mean times for each phase are reported in Table 5 and the
distributions for recall-2 are seen in Figure 3. No clear pat-
tern emerges in the mean times taken to create passwords,
but a general increase in median times can be seen in other
phases as more click-points or larger images are used. As
should be expected, participants took much longer to re-
enter their passwords after two weeks (recall-2), but as in-
tended, this allows comparison between conditions. Table 5
also displays the two-way ANOVA results for main eﬀects of
number of click-points and image size.
Hypothesis 1(a): As seen in Table 5, only the conﬁrm
and login phases show statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences for
number of click-points. These duration results provide little
evidence to support hypothesis 1(a).
Hypothesis 1(b): During recall-2, small increases in me-
dian times can be seen in Figure 3 as larger images are used.
The only statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect of image size is seen
in the conﬁrm phase. These results oﬀer very little evidence
that image size aﬀects time for password entry, and do not
support hypothesis 1(b).
Hypothesis 2: As shown in Table 6, no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in durations were seen for S6 vs. L5 or for S7 vs.
L6. Participants in conditions with comparable theoreti-
cal password spaces could create and recall their passwords
equally quickly. We therefore found no evidence to support
hypothesis 2 with respect to times.

4.3 Errors
An error was recorded every time a participant restarted
their password attempt or failed to login because their pass-
word was incorrect. Since error distributions were non-
normal, we used several non-parametric tests for analysis.
When comparing across all conditions, we ran Kruskal-Wallis
tests (conventionally reported as χ2), which are similar to
ANOVAs, but used when the distribution of the samples is
skewed, as is common with error counts. When compar-
ing two speciﬁc conditions, we conducted Wilcoxon (Mann-
Whitney) tests to check for signiﬁcant diﬀerences.

Participants in all conditions made very few errors when
entering their passwords during Session 1. For the conﬁrm,
login and recall-1 phases, the mean number of errors per ac-
count for each phase was less than 1 (Table 7). After two
weeks (recall-2), participants made many more errors, as re-
ﬂected in means ranging between 1.08 and 4.88 errors. This
contributed to the longer recall-2 times seen in Section 4.2.
The boxplots in Figure 4 show the mean number of errors
per user in the recall-2 phase.
Hypothesis 1(a): Kruskal-Wallis tests showed no eﬀect
of number of click-points on errors in any phase, therefore
oﬀering no support for hypothesis 1(a).
Hypothesis 1(b):
In Session 1, increasing the image
size had no signiﬁcant eﬀect on errors. However, there was
a signiﬁcant eﬀect of image size (χ2(1, n = 63) = 8.846, p =
0.003) in the recall-2 phase, indicating that having larger
images caused participants to make more errors after two
weeks. This result supports hypothesis 1(b), which stated
that increasing image size would decrease usability.
Hypothesis 2: Wilcoxon tests were used to compare the
number of errors between S6 and L5 and between S7 and
L6. Results showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in any phases,
providing no evidence to support hypothesis 2.
4.4 Summary of Results
We chose three measures of usability: success rates, times
and number of errors. As we describe above, phases from the
ﬁrst session (create, conﬁrm, login, and recall-1) use success
on ﬁrst attempt as the measure of success. Recall-2 uses
success within 3-attempts instead. Times and errors include
all activity until successful login.
Hypothesis 1(a): Increasing the number of click-points
will decrease usability. We found partial support for hypoth-
esis 1(a). Although several results indicate a trend towards
decreased usability with additional click-points, few statis-
tically signiﬁcant results were found. The statistically sig-
niﬁcant diﬀerences were in the recall-2 success rates, and in
the times taken to conﬁrm and login with passwords.
Hypothesis 1(b): Increasing the size of the image will
decrease usability. We found evidence supporting hypothesis
1(b). Signiﬁcant eﬀects of image size were seen in the recall-2
phase for both successes and errors. Users with large images
had lower success rates and made more errors than those
with small images. A similar trend was seen in recall-2 time
results, but statistical tests were not signiﬁcant.
Hypothesis 2: For conditions with approximately com-
parable theoretical password spaces, the condition with the
larger image size will have better usability. There were no
signiﬁcant diﬀerences for success rates, times, or number of
errors. Our results provide no support for hypothesis 2.
