User: I have a file, for example "something.exe" and I want to find path to this file
How can I do this in python?
Assistant: Uh... This question is a bit unclear.
What do you mean "have"? Do you have the name of the file? Have you opened it? Is it a file object? Is it a file descriptor? What???
If it's a name, what do you mean with "find"? Do you want to search for the file in a bunch of directories? Or do you know which directory it's in?
If it is a file object, then you must have opened it, reasonably, and then you know the path already, although you can get the filename from fileob.name too.
