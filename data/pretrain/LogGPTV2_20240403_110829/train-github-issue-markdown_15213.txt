Please provide any additional information below.  
When I use bounded typescript 1.4 compiler and the new typescript 1.5 alpha
compiler, everything is OK. I don't know where I should put this issue, so I
put it both in webstorm and typescript issue track platform. Please check and
tell me what should I do.
