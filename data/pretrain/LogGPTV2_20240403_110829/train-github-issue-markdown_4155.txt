I am building a web app with Flask when I encountered the strangest error.
`pandas-0.19.2` calls in `pandas.core.indexing`
    # 32-bit floating point machine epsilon
    _eps = np.finfo('f4').eps
The call never finish in `numpy-1.12.0` when called from the Apache server
environment with `mod_wsgi` (compiled for `Python/3.5.1+` and runtime using
`Python/3.5.2`). The code loads properly when run from a normal `Python/3.5.2`
interpreter.
The very same code executes properly with `pandas-0.18.1` and `numpy-1.11.1`
in the same Apache setup.
