this kind of bulk blacklisting is difﬁcult
enforce in the face of gateway services that maintain a large
pool of numbers over many carriers. Online services that
attempt to restrict the speed at which numbers can be reused
for new accounts face an arms race against gateways.
Phone Reputation. One option suggested in [72] for determin-
ing phone reputation is to create a service which shares abuse
data between service providers. Although little information
about how such a service could be created, we considered
that it might be possible to blacklist abusive numbers if they
are similar to each other.
We conducted a self-similarity analysis against the phone
numbers in our dataset to determine how numbers are pur-
chased. If they are purchased in bulk, it may be possible
to detect them. We analyzed all of the gateways’ numbers
to determine similar numbers using Hamming distance. We
found that most carriers use similar numbers (i.e., those with
a Hamming distance of 2 or less), and the results are shown
in Table VI. Over 40% of all of a gateway’s numbers were
similar in 7 of 8 gateways, however we found that most of
these repeated numbers are in mobile carriers, not VoIP, as
shown in Table VII. The data shows that the gateway numbers
are in the carriers that are most likely to serve legitimate users,
so attempting to block these numbers may result in a high false
positive rate.
Phone Re-veriﬁcation. Phone number re-veriﬁcation would
fail if the number were checked again outside the expected
lifetime of a gateway number. In [72], Thomas et al. saw a
median number lifetime of one hour, a reasonable point to
perform a re-veriﬁcation. In our dataset, however, we have
seen that half of all gateway numbers last up to 20 days.
Therefore, re-veriﬁcation at any interval
is unlikely to be
universally effective since phone number longevity is not
guaranteed.
C. Abuse Campaigns in SMS
Since gateways accept unsolicited messages, often do not
to users providing these
ﬁlter messages, and are subject
numbers to various services, our data contains SMS from

signiﬁcantly differs from the services sending messages, implying the primary purpose of these gateways is PVA fraud.

TABLE VII: An analysis of the similarity of gateway numbers
shows that the majority of numbers are in mobile carrier num-

block these number blocks may result in high false positives.
SPAM campaigns, phishing campaigns, and even one black
market as discussed in Section V-A. In this section, we will
discuss these campaigns.
1) Spam Campaigns: We found 1.0% of tagged messages
across 32 clusters related to advertising. Upon manual inspec-
tion none of these appeared to be solicited messages, so we
consider these to be spam messages. Of the advertising clusters
we identiﬁed, 15 are UK-based ﬁnancial services (e.g., payday
loans, credit lines) from 14 numbers. Five are for distinct bulk
messaging services. These services advertise gateways and the
ability to avoid phone veriﬁcation: “Using our service to create
and verify accounts without your own phone number.”
Another six clusters are from a speciﬁc job stafﬁng site
and appear to be bulk messages related to a job search.
Curiously, these messages contain a name and zip code. We
expanded the search beyond the labeled clusters and found
282 messages in 107 clusters. These messages may be related
to this organization testing their bulk SMS API. All of these
messages were sent to a single gateway number within a seven-
hour timespan, which is unusual when compared to other
bulk message campaigns in our dataset. Finally, two of these
messages have links to surveys via Bitly links. These links
were created by user “smsautodialer”, who has been a member
since July 2015 and has shared over 2,802 Bitly links. The
destination domain has a 0/65 detection ratio on VirusTotal.
We were surprised at the low spam volume observed in
public gateways, as they market themselves as a service for

avoiding spam. This has been a major topic of research, but the
volume of spam trafﬁc in our dataset is lower than previously
measured [37], [65].
In contrast
2) Phishing Campaigns:
to spam, phishing
messages attempt to trick the user into believing he/she is
communicating with a legitimate entity (e.g., to steal service
credentials). These scams typically use “fast-ﬂux” domain reg-
istrations to defeat domain blacklisting strategies. Therefore,
the age of the domain at the time a message arrives containing
that domain is of particular value; if the domain is new, it
may indicate that the domain is malicious. We matched the
timestamps for incoming SMS messages with the registration
times for the domains included in each message.
The
fastest domain to appear
in our dataset was
danske-mobile*com,10 a domain that had been registered
for only 11 hours before it appeared in an SMS message. The
text of the message (translated from German) is “Dear Danske
Bank customer, you have received an internal message” along-
side the URL. We believe this to be a banking phishing mes-
sage, however we were unable to verify the URL’s purpose. At
the time of this writing, the speciﬁc host in the message returns
a DNS NXDOMAIN error and the second-level domain returns
a registrar parking page. The SMS gateway that received this
message did not display the sender MSISDN number, instead
replacing it with “DanskeBank,” which may indicate number
spooﬁng. Curiously, the domain WHOIS data shows detailed
personal information (name, address, phone number) of the
registrant, who is based in the United States. The real Danske
Bank web site has registration data with contact information
in its home country, Denmark. Given this domain’s intended
purpose, we believe that this data is either incorrect or stolen
personal information, and we did not pursue the ownership
further.
In total, 8 domains appeared in messages after being regis-
tered for less than one day, as shown in Table VIII. Only one of
these domains was accessible via HTTP at the time of writing.
The domain, phone-gps*com, has an error and delivers a
stack trace when no HTTP user-agent string is provided; when
we provided one, it delivers empty content (0 bytes). This site,

The page’s code appears to reject any user name or pass-
word entered into the ﬁelds (a common practice among phish-
ing sites), and indeed, upon putting any content in these ﬁelds,
the page returned the error seen in Figure 7. As of November
2015 (less than one month since the message arrived at the
gateway), the site has been taken ofﬂine. Due to the necessity
of retrieving working domains from newly-obtained messages,
this message appears later in our dataset than other messages
we discuss in this paper.
3) Other malicious behavior: Another empirical measure
of the maliciousness of the URLs is scanning these URLs
with security products. VirusTotal provides one such measure
by requesting scans from multiple products. The full results
are displayed in Table IX. VirusTotal returned 417 URLs with
at least one detection. Only 3 URLs had 5 detections, and no
URL had more than 5 detections. Of these detections, 508 were
detected as “malicious site,” 147 as “malware site,” and 25
as “phishing site.” Unsurprisingly, danske-mobile*com
was not detected by any product, since this domain no longer
appears to host any content and it is unlikely that any of these
products can determine phishing attempts using the metadata
we previously discussed.
Overall, abusive messages (spam, phishing, and malware)
consisted of only a small portion of our dataset, despite being
billed as a major problem in popular press. This is especially
strange given that evasion of spam is something many of
the gateways advertise, as we discussed in Section III. Given
previous reports on the pervasiveness of SMS spam, we believe
that some entity in the SMS ecosystem is performing adequate

URLs had at least one detection.
[36]. Analysis of individual systems has led to the discovery
of a number of weaknesses, including usability concerns [24]
and susceptibility to desktop [50] or mobile malware [32],
[38], [40], [49], [51], [59]. SMS-based tokens are especially
vulnerable to link-layer attacks against the cellular network.
These networks use vulnerable channel encryption [28], [29],
[39], allow end devices to connect to illicit base stations [25],
[35], [43], and are vulnerable to low-rate denial of service
attacks [77], [78]. However, the majority of the infrastructure
behind many two-factor authentication systems — the portions
of the system outside the cellular network — has not been
previously explored from a security perspective.
Dmitrienko et al. were the ﬁrst to examine SMS messages
to study security of two-factor authentication schemes [38].
We greatly exceed the scope of their work in ﬁve important
ways. First, our work presents a cohesive examination of
the entire SMS infrastructure — from online services to end
devices. Second, we focus on how online services use SMS
well beyond two-factor authentication. Third, our data includes
two orders of magnitude more services and we identify and
classify the intent of each message. Fourth, we provide a more
detailed classiﬁcation of two-factor authentication systems.
Finally, our more rigorous entropy analysis of two-factor
authentication PINs allow us to make strong claims for more
than 30 services (instead of just 3), helping us to ﬁnd egregious
entropy problems in the popular WeChat and Talk2 services.

as it once was.
D. Takeaways
In this section, we explored malicious uses of the SMS
channel. First, we discussed how our data shows the prevalence
of PVA evasion due to the stark contrast between gateway
number locations and locations of users interacting with the
gateways. We then discussed the difﬁculty of detecting gate-
ways with carrier blocking due to cost and number lifetimes.
Finally, we explored abuse campaigns via SMS and found that
spam, phishing, and suspicious URLs are infrequent, which
may indicate that SMS ﬁltering at the gateways and in the
network are sufﬁcient.
