### Challenges in Bulk Blacklisting

Bulk blacklisting is difficult to enforce, especially when gateway services maintain a large pool of numbers across multiple carriers. Online services that attempt to restrict the speed at which numbers can be reused for new accounts often find themselves in an arms race against these gateways.

### Phone Reputation

One proposed solution for determining phone reputation, as suggested in [72], is to create a service that shares abuse data between service providers. While the details of such a service are not well-documented, it may be possible to blacklist abusive numbers if they exhibit similarities. We conducted a self-similarity analysis on our dataset to determine how numbers are purchased. If numbers are bought in bulk, it might be feasible to detect and block them. We analyzed the gateways' numbers using Hamming distance and found that most carriers use similar numbers (i.e., those with a Hamming distance of 2 or less). The results, shown in Table VI, indicate that over 40% of a gateway's numbers were similar in 7 out of 8 gateways. However, as shown in Table VII, most of these repeated numbers are from mobile carriers rather than VoIP. This suggests that blocking these number blocks could result in a high false positive rate, as the numbers are likely to serve legitimate users.

### Phone Re-Verification

Phone number re-verification would fail if the number is checked outside the expected lifetime of a gateway number. In [72], Thomas et al. observed a median number lifetime of one hour, which is a reasonable point for re-verification. In our dataset, however, we found that half of all gateway numbers last up to 20 days. Therefore, re-verification at any interval is unlikely to be universally effective, as the longevity of phone numbers is not guaranteed.

### Abuse Campaigns in SMS

Since gateways accept unsolicited messages and often do not filter them, our data contains SMS messages from various sources, including SPAM campaigns, phishing campaigns, and even a black market, as discussed in Section V-A. In this section, we will explore these campaigns.

#### Spam Campaigns

We identified 1.0% of tagged messages across 32 clusters related to advertising. Upon manual inspection, none of these messages appeared to be solicited, so we classified them as spam. Among the advertising clusters, 15 were UK-based financial services (e.g., payday loans, credit lines) from 14 numbers. Five clusters were for distinct bulk messaging services, which advertise gateways and the ability to avoid phone verification: "Using our service to create and verify accounts without your own phone number."

Another six clusters were from a specific job staffing site and appeared to be bulk messages related to a job search. These messages contained a name and zip code. Expanding the search beyond the labeled clusters, we found 282 messages in 107 clusters, which may be related to the organization testing their bulk SMS API. All of these messages were sent to a single gateway number within a seven-hour timespan, which is unusual compared to other bulk message campaigns in our dataset. Two of these messages included links to surveys via Bitly links, created by user "smsautodialer," who has been a member since July 2015 and has shared over 2,802 Bitly links. The destination domain had a 0/65 detection ratio on VirusTotal.

We were surprised by the low volume of spam in public gateways, as they market themselves as a service for avoiding spam. This has been a major topic of research, but the volume of spam traffic in our dataset is lower than previously measured [37], [65].

#### Phishing Campaigns

Phishing messages aim to trick users into believing they are communicating with a legitimate entity, often to steal service credentials. These scams typically use "fast-flux" domain registrations to evade domain blacklisting. We matched the timestamps for incoming SMS messages with the registration times for the domains included in each message.

The fastest domain to appear in our dataset was danske-mobile*com, which had been registered for only 11 hours before appearing in an SMS message. The text of the message (translated from German) was: "Dear Danske Bank customer, you have received an internal message" alongside the URL. We believe this to be a banking phishing message, but we were unable to verify the URL's purpose. At the time of writing, the specific host in the message returned a DNS NXDOMAIN error, and the second-level domain returned a registrar parking page. The SMS gateway that received this message did not display the sender MSISDN number, instead replacing it with "DanskeBank," indicating potential number spoofing. The domain WHOIS data showed detailed personal information (name, address, phone number) of the registrant, who is based in the United States. The real Danske Bank website has registration data with contact information in Denmark. Given this domain's intended purpose, we believe the data is either incorrect or stolen personal information.

In total, 8 domains appeared in messages after being registered for less than one day, as shown in Table VIII. Only one of these domains, phone-gps*com, was accessible via HTTP at the time of writing. This site delivered a stack trace when no HTTP user-agent string was provided and empty content (0 bytes) when a user-agent string was provided. The remaining 7 domains were all registered with contact addresses and registrars based in China and took the form of hyphen-separated English words. Since none of these domains had accessible hosts at the time of writing, we were unable to determine their purpose.

#### Other Malicious Behavior

Another empirical measure of the maliciousness of URLs is scanning them with security products. VirusTotal provides such a measure by requesting scans from multiple products. The full results are displayed in Table IX. VirusTotal returned 417 URLs with at least one detection. Only 3 URLs had 5 detections, and no URL had more than 5 detections. Of these detections, 508 were detected as "malicious site," 147 as "malware site," and 25 as "phishing site." Unsurprisingly, danske-mobile*com was not detected by any product, as the domain no longer appears to host any content.

Overall, abusive messages (spam, phishing, and malware) comprised only a small portion of our dataset, despite being billed as a major problem in popular press. This is especially strange given that evasion of spam is something many of the gateways advertise. Given previous reports on the pervasiveness of SMS spam, we believe that some entity in the SMS ecosystem is performing adequate spam filtering, and this problem may no longer be as severe as it once was.

### Takeaways

In this section, we explored the malicious uses of the SMS channel. First, we discussed how our data shows the prevalence of PVA evasion due to the stark contrast between gateway number locations and the locations of users interacting with the gateways. We then discussed the difficulty of detecting gateways with carrier blocking due to cost and number lifetimes. Finally, we explored abuse campaigns via SMS and found that spam, phishing, and suspicious URLs are infrequent, which may indicate that SMS filtering at the gateways and in the network is sufficient.
