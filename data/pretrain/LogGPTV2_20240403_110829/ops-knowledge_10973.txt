User: Our application requires fault recovery. Please introduce common fault recovery techniques and processes.
Assistant: Commonly used fault recovery techniques and processes are as follows: 1. Backup and recovery: When an application fails, if there is backup data that can be recovered, the fault recovery can be performed through backup and recovery. 2. Hot backup: Hot backup refers to real-time backup of application data and configuration to another server. When the primary server fails, it can immediately switch to the backup server to continue running the application. 3. Redundancy: The use of redundancy technology can improve the availability and stability of the system. If RAID technology is used, multiple hard disks are used to form a virtual hard disk. When any hard disk fails, data will not be lost, but data can be recovered from other hard disks. 4. Monitoring and alarm: By monitoring the status and operation of the application program, faults are found in time, and alarm information is sent by email, SMS, etc. to prompt the operation and maintenance personnel to deal with the fault in time. 5. Automated operation and maintenance: By introducing automated operation and maintenance tools, troubleshooting and recovery can be accelerated. If an automated operation and maintenance platform is introduced, tasks such as daily management, application deployment, testing, monitoring, troubleshooting, and recovery can be automated. When recovering from a fault, you generally need to follow the steps below: 1. Fault discovery: Faults are found through the monitoring system or through user feedback. 2. Fault analysis: analyze the fault, find out the cause and scope of the fault, and adopt different fault recovery methods. 3. Fault recovery: According to the fault analysis results, the fault recovery method is adopted for fault recovery. 4. Test verification: test and verify the system after failure recovery to ensure the normal operation of the system. 5. Fault record: record the cause of the fault, the handling process, and the recovery result to provide reference for subsequent fault analysis and processing.
