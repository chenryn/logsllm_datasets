Bug
**What is the current behavior?**
The following code example works well with `text` input type, but allows
inputs like `012` or `0012` to be entered when using the `number` input type.
The `console.log` line always runs and shows the right value, and the App
state is also correct when checked with React Developer Tools. It's only that
the controlled input is not being "controlled" somehow.
    class App extends Component {
      constructor() {
        super()
        this.state = {
          value: '',
        }
      }
      handleChange = e => {
        const value = e.target.value
        const num = parseInt(value, 10)
        console.log(num)
        this.setState({ value: isNaN(num) ? '' : num })
      }
      render() {
        return (
        )
      }
    }

**What is the expected behavior?**  
Input should reflect the state, thus not allowing strings like `012`, etc. to
be displayed.
**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
Did this work in previous versions of React?**
