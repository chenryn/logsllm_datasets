I recently opened a `plugins.js` file from a theme I purchased on ThemeForest. This file contained numerous compressed JavaScript plugins, amounting to a total of 700KB of code. Upon opening the file, my Integrated Development Environment (IDE) froze for several minutes, and I was only able to regain control by right-clicking and closing the tab.

My system specifications are as follows:
- IDE Version: 0.201
- Operating System: Windows 7 (64-bit)
- RAM: 4GB
- Processor: Intel i5

If you have any suggestions on how to improve performance or handle large files more efficiently, I would greatly appreciate your advice.
