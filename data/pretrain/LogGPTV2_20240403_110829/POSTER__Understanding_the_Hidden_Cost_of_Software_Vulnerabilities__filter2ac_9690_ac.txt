provided in Fig. 5, and shows that the majority of the instances are forecasted
precisely. In Fig. 4, although visual representation suggests a weakness of ﬁt with
ARIMA in prediction the stock values, the diﬀerence in the value of MSE for
these to models, 6.42 for ARIMA and 0.59 for NARX, quantitatively justiﬁes
the goodness of the proposed method over methods used in the literature.
5 Results
We experimented with a large number of vulnerabilities, meaning that multiple
vulnerabilities could correspond to a single date. Therefore, the eﬀect we see
could be due to one or more vulnerabilities. For every vulnerability disclosure
date and vendor, we calculate % Abnormal Return on days 0, 1, and 2 (AR1,
AR2, and AR3 respectively as described above). The results are presented in
Table 2. The table contains the normalized MSE, count of the vulnerabilities,
and Abnormal Return on days 1, 2, and 3 for every vendor (as described above).
We observe that vulnerabilities had an adverse impact on the stock price of 17
out of the 36 vendors.
Table 4 represents a breakdown of vendors by industry and their likeli-
hood of their stock being impacted by vulnerabilities. For the classiﬁcation of
388

industries, the software industry contains vendors such as Adobe, Apache, Atlas-
sian, Google, VMware, Sap, Oracle, Redhat, and Alteryx. The device indus-
try includes Advantech and Apple. The networking industry includes Cisco,
Citrix, Netgear, and Zyxel. The security industry includes Fortinet, Juniper,
Paloalto Networks, Symantec, and Trendmicro. The consumer product industry
includes Rockwell Automation, Osram, Splunk, Schneider, Teradata, Facebook,
Netapp, and Viacom. The electronics & hardware industry includes Lenovo,
and Nvidia. Finally, the ﬁnance industry includes Equifax and Dow Jones. To
assign a likelihood of an industry’s stock price being impacted by vulnerabili-
ties, we use Highly-Likely when the number of vendors with stock price aﬀected
negatively by the vulnerabilities in the given industry is larger than those not
aﬀected, Less-Likely otherwise; we use Equally-Likely when the number of ven-
dors aﬀected equals the number of vendors not aﬀected.
We look at vulnerabilities from 10 vendors to ﬁnd the reason for the nearly no-
eﬀect of vulnerabilities in some industries. We see that in every dataset there are
a few dates which have no signiﬁcant positive eﬀect (from vendors perspective)
on the market leading the results to be negative. By referring to the description
of the vulnerabilities, we observe that:
1. Vulnerabilities aﬀecting vendors’ stock negatively are of critical severity (vul-
nerabilities with CVSS version 3 label of CRITICAL) while the rest were less
severe (vulnerabilities with CVSS labels of HIGH or MEDIUM).
2. Vulnerabilities aﬀecting vendors’ stock price negatively have a combination of
version 3 label of HIGH or CRITICAL, and a description containing phrases
such as “denial of service”, “allows remote attacker to read/execute”, “allows
context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External Entity XXE attacks
via a crafted PDF”, and “allows context-dependent attackers to have unspec-
iﬁed impact via an invalid character”. Additionally, vulnerabilities descrip-
tion such as “allows authenticated remote attacker to read/execute”, “remote
attackers to cause a denial of service”, and “allows remote attackers to write
to ﬁles of arbitrary types via unspeciﬁed vectors” have little (on days 0, 1,
and 2) to no eﬀect on the stock price. Therefore, we can conclude that vul-
nerabilities involving unauthorized accesses have a higher cost, seen in their
detrimental eﬀect on the stock price.
3. Vulnerabilities with phrases such as “local users with access to” and “denial
of service” in the description have no impact on the stock. Therefore, DoS
attacks lacking conﬁdentiality factor lead to no impact on stock value.
For the vulnerabilities gathered from the press, we followed the same steps.
We found that these vulnerabilities have an adverse eﬀect on vendor stock price
in almost every case.
6 Statistical Signiﬁcance
To understand the statistical signiﬁcance of our results, we use the conﬁdence
interval of the observations as a guideline. Particularly, we measure the statistical
Understanding the Hidden Cost of Software Vulnerabilities

conﬁdence of overall eﬀect of vulnerabilities corresponding to a vendor on days
1, 2, and 3, respectively. Table 3 shows the conﬁdence intervals (lower and upper
limit) on days 1, 2, and 3, measured with 95% conﬁdence.
95% Conﬁdence Interval. 95% Conﬁdence Interval (CI) is a range that con-
tains the true mean of a population with 95% certainty. For a smaller population,
the CI is almost similar to the range of the data, while only a tiny sample of data
lies within the conﬁdence interval for a large population. In our study, we have
noticed that our data populations are diverse, where some vendors have a small
number of samples, and others have larger number of samples. For example,
Figs. 6, 7 and 8 show the distribution of observations of eﬀect for multiple exam-
ple vendors and several vulnerabilities associated with each vendor. The shown
histogram captures counts of the eﬀect of vulnerabilities; the x-axis includes
brackets of the eﬀect (measured by OAR) and the y-axsis captures the count for
the given eﬀect. The diversity of the eﬀect is well-captured by the count distri-
bution; high severity impact is seen in a vendor where the counts are focused in
the negative side of the interval, whereas lower (or no) impact is seen where the
count focus is in the positive side. The conﬁdence interval with 95% conﬁdence
for a given population (distribution) can be calculated as,
(cid:4)
¯x − 1.96
σ√
n
CI =
, ¯x + 1.96
(cid:5)
,
σ√
n
where ¯x is the mean of the population, σ is the standard deviation, and n is the
number of samples in the population.
Putting it into perspective, while OARi, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}, captures the
overall eﬀect of vulnerabilities corresponding to a vendor, the Conﬁdence Interval
(CIi, where i ∈ {1, 2, 3}) gives the conﬁdence for the eﬀect to lie within its upper
and lower bound. In Table 3, and by considering the data associated with Adobe,
for example, we can say with 95% conﬁdence that the conﬁdence interval for the
population, CIi, contains the true mean, OARi. We also observe that:
1. Our OARi in Table 2 are within their respective conﬁdence intervals, which
means that our results reported earlier are statistically signiﬁcant.
2. The true mean values for Adobe, Palo Alto Networks, Schneider Electric, and
Teradata, on the day a vulnerability is disclosed, are bounded in negative
intervals. Thus, the probability for a vulnerability having an eﬀect on the day
a vulnerability is disclosed on the vendor’s stock price is highly likely.
3. The true mean for Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Schneider Electric, and Zyxel
on days after the day a vulnerability is disclosed are bounded in negative
intervals. Thus, the probability for a vulnerability having a negative impact
on days succeeding the day a vulnerability is disclosed on the vendor’s stock
price is highly likely.
4. The true mean for every vendor on the three days is bounded from below
by negative value. Although the conﬁdence intervals do not say anything
about the percentage of population that would fall in the negative side of
the interval, the lower bound indicate a likelihood that the population would

Fig. 8. Histogram of the eﬀect of vulnerabilities on stock value: Apple
have samples with negative eﬀect on the vendor’s stock. Thus, given the
various vulnerabilities on a speciﬁc vendor, it is likely that some of those
vulnerabilities would have a negative eﬀect on the vendor’s stock value, even
though the overall eﬀect (measured by the mean) would be nulliﬁed. This, as
well, is well captured in our analysis.
7 Discussion and Comparison
There has been several works dedicated to understanding the hidden cost of
software vulnerabilities in the literature, which we discuss in the following across
multiple aspects by comparison.
