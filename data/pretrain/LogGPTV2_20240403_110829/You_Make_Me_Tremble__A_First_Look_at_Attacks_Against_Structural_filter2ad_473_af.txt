A STRUCTURE’S EQUATION OF MOTION
We can model the frame shown in Fig.30a as the simple, dynami-
cally equivalent model shown in Fig. 30b. In this model, the lateral
stiffness of the columns is modeled by the spring (k), the damping
is modeled by the shock absorber (c) and the mass of the floor is
modeled by the mass (m). Figure 30c shows the free body diagram of
the structure. The forces include the spring force 𝑓𝑠 (𝑡 ), the damping
force 𝑓𝑑 (𝑡 ), the external dynamic load on the structure 𝑝 (𝑡 ), and
the inertial force 𝑓𝑖 (𝑡 ). These forces are defined as:
𝑓𝑠 = 𝑘𝑞(𝑡 )
𝑓𝑑 = 𝑐 ¤𝑞(𝑡 )
𝑓𝑖 = 𝑚 ¥𝑞(𝑡 )
(5)
where ¤𝑞(𝑡 ) is the first derivative of the displacement with respect to
time (velocity) and ¥𝑞(𝑡 ) is the second derivative of the displacement
with respect to time (acceleration). Summing the forces shown in
Figs. 30b and c, we obtain the following:
 𝐹 = 𝑚 ¥𝑞(𝑡 ) = 𝑝 (𝑡 ) − 𝑐 ¤𝑞(𝑡 ) − 𝑘𝑞(𝑡 )
(6)
Translating this concept to a multiple degree of freedom and
its equivalent dynamic model is shown in Fig. 31, with 𝑛-degrees
of freedom subjected to 𝑚1 external excitation and 𝑚2 controlling
devices, we obtain the following expression:
Mq(𝑡 ) + Cq(𝑡 ) + Kq(𝑡 ) = Tuu(𝑡 ) + Tpp(t)
(7)
where q(𝑡 ) ∈ R𝑛×1 is the displacement vector relative to the ground,
M, C, K ∈ R𝑛×𝑛 are the mass, damping, and stiffness matrices, re-
spectively; u(𝑡 ) ∈ R𝑚2×1 is the control force vector; Tu ∈ R𝑛×𝑚2
and Tw ∈ R𝑛×𝑚1 are the control and excitation location matrices,
respectively. In terms of calculating the inter-story drift (ISD), the
displacement is shown Fig. 31 and the calculated inter-story drift
is determined by Δ2 = (𝑞2 − 𝑞1) with the inter-story drift ratio
computed as, Δ𝑟 2 = (𝑞2 − 𝑞1)/ℎ2 and Δ𝑟 1 = 𝑞1/ℎ1 . In the case of
the building subjected to seismic loading, the spatial load pattern
vector Tp is equal to −M(cid:8)¯I(cid:9)𝑛×1 ¥𝑞𝑔 (𝑡 ) where the external excita-
tion ¥𝑞𝑔 (𝑡 ) is the ground acceleration time history. Chen et al. [14]
and Connor and Laflamme[21] provide additional information of
the mathematical derivation of buildings equipped with control
devices.

The state variables that define the mathematical representation of
the structure according to Equation (1) are chosen to be: (i) the
position of the moving cart at story 1 𝑥𝑐1, (ii) the position of the
moving cart of floor 2 𝑥𝑐2, (iii) displacement at story 1 𝑥 𝑓 1, (iv)
displacement at story 2 𝑥 𝑓 2, (v) velocity of cart 1 ¤𝑥𝑐1, (vi) velocity
of cart 2 ¤𝑥 𝑓 2, (vii) velocity of story 1 relative to the ground ¤𝑥 𝑓 1, and
(viii) velocity of story 2 relative to the ground ¤𝑥 𝑓 2. These are the
variables that are considered to provide information about the state
of the structure. The output vector z corresponds to the inter-story
drifts Δ𝑥 𝑓 1 = 𝑥 𝑓 1 and Δ𝑥 𝑓 2 = 𝑥 𝑓 2 − 𝑥 𝑓 1. The state-space vector of
the plant is given by
