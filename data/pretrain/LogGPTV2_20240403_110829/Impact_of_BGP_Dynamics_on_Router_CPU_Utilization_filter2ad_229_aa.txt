1 Introduction
The Internet is an interconnection of separately administered networks called Auto-
nomous Systems or ASes. To reach entities outside the AS, the inter-domain routing
protocol used today is the Border Gateway Protocol or BGP [1]. It has been approxima-
tely 15 years since BGP was deployed on the Internet. The number of ASes participating
in BGP has grown to over 16, 000 today. However, this growth has been super-linear
during the past few years [2]. With this sudden growth there has been concern in the
research community about how well BGP is scaling. In particular, it has been noted
that there is signiﬁcant growth in the volume of BGP route announcements (or route
ﬂapping) [3] and in the number of BGP route entries in the routers of various ASes [2].
For every BGP routing update that is received by a router, several tasks need to
be performed [4]. First, the appropriate RIB-in (routing information base) needs to be
updated. Ingress ﬁltering, as deﬁned in the router’s conﬁguration, has to be applied to
the route announcement. If it is not ﬁltered out, the route undergoes the BGP route
selection rules and it is compared against other routes. If it is selected, then it is added
to the BGP routing table and the appropriate forwarding table entry is updated. Egress
ﬁltering then needs to be applied for every BGP peer (except the one that sent the original
announcement). New BGP announcements need to be generated and then added to the
appropriate RIB-out queues.
These actions can increase the load on the router CPU. Long periods of high router
CPU utilization are undesirable due to two main reasons. High utilization can potenti-
ally increase the amount of time a router spends processing a routing change, thereby
increasing route convergence time. High route convergence times can cause packet loss
by increasing the window of time during which the route for a particular destination is
unavailable. Further, high router CPU utilization can disrupt other tasks, such as other
protocol processing, keep alive message processing and in extreme cases, can cause the
router to crash.
In this work, we answer the question “Do BGP routing table changes cause an
increase in average router CPU utilization in the Sprint IP network?”. Sprint operates a
“tier-1” IP network that connects to over 2, 000 other ASes. Thus, we believe that it is a
suitable point for studying the impact of BGP on average router CPU utilization. There
has been prior work [5,6] in analyzing BGP protocol behavior during worm propagation.
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior published work on analyzing the
relationship between BGP protocol behavior and router CPU utilization. We examine

BGP data from multiple routers in the network. We correlate this with SNMP data on
CPU utilization for about 200 routers on different days inside Sprint. The ﬁndings of
our work are:
– On average, BGP processes consume the majority of router CPU cycles. For short
periods of time, we observe very high router CPU utilization due to BGP processes.
– We ﬁnd that during normal network operation, there is some correlation between
short increases in the number of BGP routing table changes and increases in average
router CPU utilization and vice versa, at the time granularity of 5 minutes. However,
over all the instances we observed, the impact was negligible.
– We ﬁnd that during the SQL Slammer worm attack in January 2003, there was a
tremendous increase in the amount of BGP changes that lasted for several hours and
there was a correlation with average router CPU utilization. However, we ﬁnd that
the increase in utilization during this time was under 20% for almost all routers.
There are some limitations of our work:
– Since the Sprint IP network consists purely of Cisco routers, we do not measure
how other router architectures react to BGP protocol behavior.
– We do not benchmark router CPU performance in a laboratory testbed. Our emphasis
is on actual performance in an operational environment.
– We do not attempt to create a detailed model of how the router CPU should react
to different kinds and volumes of BGP messages. Such a model will be heavily
inﬂuenced by the operating system source code, which we do not have access to.
2 Analysis Data
To understand how BGP routing table changes impact average router CPU utilization,
we need to analyze three kinds of data from the operational network. We now describe
the routers that we access, the interactive session data, the SNMP (Simple Network
Management Protocol) data and the BGP data that we analyze.
2.1 Routers
The Sprint network (AS 1239) consists of over 600 routers, all of which are Cisco
routers. We had access to data from 196 routers, the majority of which are Cisco GSR
12000 series and Cisco 7500 series with VIP interfaces. They all have either about 256
MB or 512 MB of processor memory. The route processor on each of these routers is a
200 Mhz MIPS R5000 family processor. The BGP routing protocol runs as part of the
operating system. On older routers such as the Cisco 1600, 2500, 4500, 4700, 7200, and
7500, there is a single processor that runs both the operating system (IOS) and packet
switching [7]. On newer architectures, such as the Cisco 7500−V IP and GSR−12000,
the main processor runs IOS and interface card processors perform distributed packet
switching. On these routers, the route processor runs all the routing protocols, builds the
forwarding, CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding) and adjacency tables and distributes them
to the line cards.

There are typically four BGP processes in Cisco IOS 1. The “BGP Open” process
handles opening BGP sessions with other routers. It runs rarely. The “BGP Scanner”
process checks the reachability of every route in the BGP table and performs route
dampening. It will run once a minute and the size of the routing table will determine how
long it takes to complete. The “BGP Router” process receives and sends announcements
and calculates the best BGP path. It runs every second. The “BGP I/O” process handles
the processing and queueing involved in receiving and sending BGP messages. The
frequency of execution of this process will be related to the frequency of BGP updates.
2.2
Interactive Session Data
All the routers in our study allow command line interface (CLI) access via secure shell
(SSH). Upon logging into the router, we can issue commands to query the state of the
router. We issued the “show process cpu” command to all routers during the study.
This command lists all the processes in IOS, along with the CPU utilization of each
process [7]. Both the percentage utilization of the CPU (over the last 5 seconds, 1 minute
and 5 minutes) and the total number of CPU milliseconds consumed since the last boot
of IOS is reported. This data provides an instantaneous snapshot of what processes are
currently loading the CPU and which processes have consumed the most CPU resources
since boot up. A sample output is below.
CPU utilization for five seconds: 99%/2%; one minute: 18%; five minutes: 15%

Due to the limitation of how frequently we can collect CLI data, we also collect SNMP
data. The SNMP protocol allows for a data collection machine to query certain SNMP
counters on these routers and store the values in a database. We query the 1 minute
exponentially-decayed moving average of the CPU busy percentage as deﬁned in SNMP
MIB 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.2.1.57. We query and store this value once every 5 minutes from each
one of the 196 routers that we have access to. The network operators cited concerns about
affecting the router CPU load if we were to poll this counter more frequently. This data
provides us with the CPU utilization at a relatively large time scale granularity and hence
does not identify the process responsible for high load. We have collected this data for
as long as 2.5 years for some routers.
2.4 BGP Routing Data
In order to know if high CPU utilization is caused by a large number of BGP messages,
we also analyze BGP data. We collect iBGP data from over 150 routers in the Sprint

network, all of which we also collect SNMP data from. We collect BGP data using the
GNU Zebra 2 routing software. We connect to about 150 routers which comprise the
iBGP route reﬂector mesh inside the Sprint network. Each PoP announces BGP routes
that originate from it to the data collector. We also connect as route reﬂector clients to
two routers in two different PoPs.
3 Results
3.1 Short Time Scale Behavior
We ﬁrst address the impact of the BGP routing protocol on router CPU utilization in
short time scales. We analyze interactive session data here using the “show process
cpu” command on routers in the Sprint network. This command was executed during
normal network operation when no signiﬁcant outage or abnormal behavior occurred.
Across all 196 routers that we have access to, we see one of two cases when we execute
the command. The common case is when the CPU is lightly loaded and no process
is consuming a signiﬁcant percentage of CPU load. In other cases, either the “BGP
Scanner” or the “BGP Router” process consumes a signiﬁcant percentage (sometimes
over 95%) of CPU load in the 5 second average, but not in the longer term averages.
This indicates that for very short time periods, BGP processes can contribute to high
load on a router CPU. Aggregate statistics on how often this short time scale behavior
manifests itself are difﬁcult to produce since they are highly dependent on the collection
methodology. Since polling techniques may have a lower priority than other routing
processes in the operating system, aggregate results for such short time scales may be
unreliable. However, for the remainder of this section, we focus on longer time scale
behavior which does not suffer from this problem.
3.2 Aggregate Behavior
The main focus of this work is the impact of BGP dynamics on time scales that are
long enough to have the potential to increase route convergence times and impact router
stability. The ﬁrst issue to address here is how much the overall contribution of the BGP
processes is to the CPU cycles consumed by the router operating system.
The interactive session data shows the number of CPU cycles that each process has
consumed since the router was booted. If we add the values for the three BGP processes
and compare that to the sum of all the processes, we know the percentage of CPU
cycles that the BGP protocol has consumed. On 20 February 2003, we collected a single
snapshot of “show process cpu” data from all 196 routers that we have access to. On
this day, no signiﬁcant outage or abnormal network behavior occurred. Over 85% of
the routers had been up for over 10 weeks when we collected the snapshots, which we
consider to be long enough for a reliable reading. We calculate the percentage of CPU
cycles that BGP processes consume and plot the histogram in Figure 1. We see that
for the majority of routers, BGP processes consume over 60% of CPU cycles. Most of
the routers below 60% were being phased out of the network and thus had few or no

BGP adjacencies. This histogram was similar across other days that we collected data
on. We ﬁnd that the BGP processes consume the majority of CPU cycles during router
uptime. Given how much resource this protocol consumes, there is signiﬁcant potential
for protocol dynamics to directly impact router CPU load.
We now consider how frequently high CPU load occurs in operational routers over
a 2.5 year period. During this time, a CPU load value is reported every 5 minutes via
SNMP. Across the routers that we have data for over 2.5 years, roughly 0.6% of the 5
minute samples are missing. This may be due to router reboots and / or losses in SNMP
data collection. We ﬁnd that typically in less than 1% of these samples the CPU load
was above 50%. For the vast majority of time across these routers, the CPU load was
below 50%.
In Figure 2, we only consider time periods when the CPU load was above 50%. We
transform the data into the number of consecutive time intervals with high CPU load
and plot the cumulative sum of the sorted data. This shows that of the high CPU load
occurrences, the majority of them occur for short time periods, but there are some that
occur for long periods of time. This behavior is typical compared to the other routers
for which we have data. These graphs are over very long periods of time, during which

abnormal network conditions may have occurred to cause the long durations of high
load. We now examine typical network conditions and abnormal network conditions
separately, and speciﬁcally consider the impact by BGP.
3.3 Typical Network Conditions
We begin by considering a typical week (10-17 February 2003) when no signiﬁcant
network event occurred. We examine if variations in the rate of BGP changes impact
the average CPU utilization. In Figure 3, we show the number of BGP routing table
changes at a router in the Sprint network. The graph is similar for other routers in the
network; this one is picked arbitrarily. Each point in the graph represents the total number
of changes to the BGP table during a 5 minute period. We see that on average, there
are about 600 routing table changes every 5 minutes, but spikes of much higher rate of
change occur. One such spike consisted of over 30, 000 changes, which we denote as
“Event A”. However, these spikes do not last a long time.
During this same time period, we plot the CPU load in percentage for the same
router in Figure 4. Each point shows the percentage of CPU cycles that were consumed
by the operating system (the remaining cycles are idle). This value is the 1 minute
exponentially-decayed moving average of the CPU load and there is a point every 5
minutes. We see that the load is typically around 25%, and in one case exceeded 45%
(which we denote as “Event B”).
Comparing Figure 3 to Figure 4 shows little correlation. There is very little cross
correlation between the two time series over the whole week. The CCF (cross correlation
function) magnitude is less than 0.1. In Figure 5, we show the cross correlation between
the two time series for a two hour period around “Event A”. We see that even during
this short but signiﬁcant increase in the number of BGP events, there is only a small
correlation with the CPU load (a maximum CCF of about 0.3). In Figure 6, we focus
on “Event B” where there was a signiﬁcant increase in the CPU load. While there is
some correlation here (a maximum CCF of about 0.6), when we check Figure 3 around
“Event B”, we do not see a very large increase compared to normal activity throughout
the week.
