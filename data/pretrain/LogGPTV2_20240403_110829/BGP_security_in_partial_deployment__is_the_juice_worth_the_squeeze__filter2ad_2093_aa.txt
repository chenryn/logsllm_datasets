**Abstract:**
As the deployment of secure route origin authentication using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) gradually gains traction among network operators, there is a growing push to standardize secure path validation for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), such as S-BGP, soBGP, and BGPSEC. Origin authentication already significantly improves routing security. However, the transition to these more advanced protocols (collectively referred to as S*BGP) is expected to be a long and slow process, with S*BGP coexisting alongside traditional BGP in a state of partial deployment for an extended period.

In this study, we use both theoretical and experimental approaches to evaluate the security benefits provided by partially deployed S*BGP compared to those already offered by origin authentication. Given that routing policies have a profound impact on routing security, we conducted a survey of 100 network operators to identify the most popular policies likely to be used during the partial deployment phase. Our findings indicate that S*BGP offers only marginal additional security benefits over origin authentication when these popular policies are in place. We also examine the security implications of other routing policies, provide prescriptive guidelines for the partial deployment of S*BGP, and highlight how the interaction between S*BGP and traditional BGP can introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.

## 1. Introduction

Recent high-profile routing failures [9, 14, 42, 43] have underscored significant vulnerabilities in BGP, the Internet's interdomain routing protocol. To address these issues, secure origin authentication using the RPKI [34] is gaining traction among network operators. Additionally, there is a push to standardize a path validation protocol, such as S-BGP, soBGP, and BGPSEC, collectively known as S*BGP [28, 33, 49]. Origin authentication is relatively lightweight, requiring minimal changes to existing infrastructure. 

However, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be a lengthy and gradual process, with S*BGP and traditional BGP coexisting in a state of partial deployment. This paper aims to evaluate the security benefits of partial S*BGP deployment, considering the impact of various routing policies and providing guidelines to mitigate potential new vulnerabilities.
