ABSTRACT
As the rollout of secure route origin authentication with the
RPKI slowly gains traction among network operators, there
is a push to standardize secure path validation for BGP (i.e.,
S*BGP: S-BGP, soBGP, BGPSEC, etc.). Origin authentica-
tion already does much to improve routing security. More-
over, the transition to S*BGP is expected to be long and
slow, with S*BGP coexisting in “partial deployment” along-
side BGP for a long time. We therefore use theoretical and
experimental approach to study the security beneﬁts pro-
vided by partially-deployed S*BGP, vis-a-vis those already
provided by origin authentication. Because routing policies
have a profound impact on routing security, we use a survey
of 100 network operators to ﬁnd the policies that are likely to
be most popular during partial S*BGP deployment. We ﬁnd
that S*BGP provides only meagre beneﬁts over origin au-
thentication when these popular policies are used. We also
study the security beneﬁts of other routing policies, pro-
vide prescriptive guidelines for partially-deployed S*BGP,
and show how interactions between S*BGP and BGP can
introduce new vulnerabilities into the routing system.

INTRODUCTION
Recent high-proﬁle routing failures [9,14,42,43] have high-
lighted major vulnerabilities in BGP, the Internet’s interdo-
main routing protocol. To remedy this, secure origin authen-
tication [10, 38, 40] using the RPKI [34] is gaining traction
among network operators, and there is now a push to stan-
dardize a path validation protocol (i.e., S*BGP [28, 33, 49]).
Origin authentication is relatively lightweight, requiring nei-
