## Abstract

In April 2010, China Telecom's hijack of approximately 50,000 IP prefixes highlighted the potential for traffic interception on the Internet. The sensitivity of the hijacked prefixes, including those of US government agencies, garnered significant attention and underscored the importance of characterizing such incidents post-occurrence. This study uses the China Telecom incident as a case study to:
1. Determine what can be learned about large-scale routing anomalies using public datasets.
2. Identify the types of data that should be collected to diagnose routing anomalies in the future.

We develop a methodology for inferring which prefixes may be impacted by traffic interception using only control-plane data and validate our technique using data-plane traces. Our key findings are:
1. The geographic distribution of announced prefixes is similar to the global distribution, with a bias towards the Asia-Pacific region.
2. There is little evidence of subprefix hijacking, supporting the hypothesis that this incident was likely a route leak.
3. Providers inadvertently enabled the interception of their customers' traffic by preferring customer routes.

## 1. Introduction

On April 8, 2010, Autonomous System (AS) 23724, owned by China Telecom, announced approximately 50,000 prefixes registered to other ASes. These prefixes included IPs registered to the US Department of Defense, drawing the attention of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. Unlike previous routing misconfigurations, China Telecom’s network had the capacity to support the additional traffic attracted. Additionally, data-plane evidence suggested that during the incident, Internet traffic reached its correct destination, leading some to speculate that this was an attempt to intercept Internet traffic.

While the China Telecom incident has been discussed in blogs, news outlets, and government reports, there has been no academic attempt to understand it. This study aims to fill this gap by using publicly available control- and data-plane measurements to address the following questions:
1. Understanding the properties of the hijacked prefixes.
2. Quantifying the impact of the event in terms of subprefix hijacking.
3. Explaining how interception was possible.

We emphasize that while we can characterize the incident and show evidence supporting the hypothesis that it appears to be an accident, there is currently no way to distinguish between "fat finger" incidents and those with malicious intent based solely on empirical data.

### 1.1 Insecurity of the Internet's Routing System

Routing security incidents have occurred repeatedly over the past 15 years. These incidents involve an AS originating an IP prefix without the permission of the AS to which the prefix is allocated. Typically, when hijacks occur, the misconfigured network either lacks sufficient capacity to handle the traffic or does not have an alternate path to the destination, resulting in service outages or connectivity interruptions.

More concerning are cases of traffic interception, where traffic flows through the hijacking AS and reaches the intended destination. Without continuous monitoring of network delays or AS paths, such incidents are difficult to detect, creating opportunities for the hijacker to monitor or alter intercepted traffic. Traffic interception was demonstrated in 2008 and more recently during the China Telecom incident.

Since the China Telecom incident involved interception, measuring its impact is extremely difficult without extensive monitoring infrastructure. We define criteria to infer potential interceptions using only control-plane data and use data-plane measurements to validate our criteria and characterize the AS topologies that allowed for inadvertent interception.

### 1.2 Key Insights

- **Geographic Distribution of Announced Prefixes:** The distribution of announced prefixes is similar to the global distribution, with a bias towards the Asia-Pacific region.
- **Matching Existing Routable Prefixes:** Over 99% of the announced prefixes match those existing at Routeviews monitors, supporting the conclusion that the announced prefixes were a subset of AS 23724’s routing table.
- **Inadvertent Interception:** Many networks that routed traffic from China Telecom to the correct destination did so because the destination was reachable via a customer path preferred over the path through China Telecom (a peer).

## 2. Related Work

The China Telecom incident in April 2010 received little attention until November 2010, when the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission published a report to Congress. Subsequently, the incident gained attention in news articles and technical blogs.

BGPMon, an organization that provides BGP monitoring and analysis, performed the first investigation of the China Telecom incident. Using control-plane measurements of BGP messages, they identified anomalous updates and studied the geographic distribution of the hijacked prefixes, finding that the majority belonged to organizations in the US and China.

Renesys confirmed the geographic distribution of hijacked prefixes observed by BGPMon and used traceroute to show that network traffic could pass into China Telecom’s network and back out to the intended destination. Arbor Networks, using ATLAS project data, focused on understanding the amount of traffic diverted into China Telecom but did not observe a significant increase in traffic entering AS 4134 on the day of the incident.

Our focus is on analyzing the incident using publicly available data to understand what can be learned and what types of data should be collected in the future.

## 3. Methodology

To characterize the events of April 8, 2010, we use a combination of publicly available control- and data-plane measurements.

### 3.1 Control-Plane Measurements

- **BGP Updates:** We use Routeviews monitors as a source of BGP updates. Updates with the path attribute ending in “4134 23724 23724” are considered part of the incident. Table 1 summarizes the updates and prefixes matching this signature.
- **Topology Data:** We use the Cyclops AS-graph from April 8, 2010, to infer the set of neighbors of China Telecom and their business relationships, which is crucial for identifying ASes that potentially forwarded traffic in and out of China Telecom during the incident.

### 3.2 Data-Plane Measurements

We use data-plane measurements from the iPlane project and extract traceroutes transiting China Telecom’s network on April 8, 2010. If a traceroute AS-path contains China Telecom (AS 4134 or AS 23724) on April 8 but not on April 7 or 9, we conclude that this traceroute was impacted by the incident. If the final AS in the path is not AS 4134 or 23724, we conclude that the traceroute was intercepted. Figure 1 shows an example of an intercepted traceroute.

In total, we observed 1,575 traceroutes transiting China Telecom on April 8, with 1,124 being impacted and 479 potentially intercepted, of which 357 received a successful response from the target.

### 3.3 Limitations

- **Inaccuracies in the AS-Graph:** AS-graphs suffer from inaccuracies in inferring AS-relationships and poor visibility into peering links, impacting our analysis of interception.
- **Inaccurate IP to AS Mappings:** Our mapping of IP addresses to ASes may be affected by IXPs or sibling ASes managed by the same institution. However, the impact of siblings (e.g., per-province ASes managed by China Telecom) is mitigated since paths to these ASes would normally transit China Telecom’s backbone AS 4134.
