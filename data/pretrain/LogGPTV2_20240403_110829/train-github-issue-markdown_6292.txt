## üìù Provide a description of the new feature
I want a feature that helps me to resize my window to specific size given by
user input ( 1024x724 or 1280x720).
_What is the expected behavior of the proposed feature? What is the scenario
this would be used?_
This feature will help me to resize my window to whatever size I want so that
I can keep my window to my video resolution.  
For example, some times I use a 3440x1440 monitor. when I screen record I want
to record the video in 1280x720 resolution. So I wan to resize my application
window to exactly 1280x720 so that it fits perfectly in my video. currently
I'm resizing my window manually by just adjusting it and it's taking very long
time. If you can give me this feature then I can just drag and drop my window
in that tile and it will automatically get resized to the given size.
