The IDEA
• Read “Mapping Process of Digital Forensic 
Investigation Frameworks” – Selamat, Yusof, 
and Sahib [IJCSNS Vol 8 No 10, Oct 2008]
• Thought: Lots of methodologies out there, but 
none were what I “taught” or saw as issues 
when running a forensic team.
• Why not make my processes and methods 
into a new, practical methodology?
Mapping Process of Digital Forensic 
Investigation Framework
Mapping Process of Digital Forensic Investigation Framework, Selamat, Yusof, Sahib, 2008
Typical Digital Investigation 
Methodologies
• Most frameworks cover the range from 
acquisition to reporting
• Such as: 
– Obtaining authorization for investigations
– Determining evidence locations
– Determining and validating techniques to find and 
interpret significant data
– Summarize and provide explanation of 
conclusions

Stages / Processes / Phases
• There are some really good methodologies 
out there
• Integrated Digital Investigation process (IDIP), 
Digital Forensic Research Workshop (DFRWS)
– Identification, preservation, examination, analysis, 
presentation, and decision
• Enhanced IDIP includes a “Dynamite” Phase

Introduction to the “Problem”
• Problems with learning and performing digital 
Forensic Investigations
– Open solution set, many ways to find or 
approximate the “answer”
– A lot of self-teaching & “sit and do it”
– Patience, learning to “stay on target”, and having 
to learn new techniques while performing an 
investigation
• All of these things improve over time as an 
analyst gains experience
Open Solution Set
• Last cup of coffee[1]
– You arrive in the break room and find 5 individuals 
drinking coffee and the pot empty.  You want to 
determine who drank the last cup.
– How many ways can you determine who drank the 
last cup?
[1] B. Carrier, A Brief Introduction To the Computer History Model, 2008
Determine Who Drank the Last Cup!
• Measure the amount of coffee in each cup
• Measure temperature of each coffee
• Measure strength of each coffee (stronger on bottom of 
pot?)
• Amount of coffee grounds in each cup
• Interview individuals, analysis for truthfulness
• Interview group, analysis for truthfulness
• Develop timeline for coffee drinkers (internal and 
external)
• Measure the temperature of the cup (heat loss) vs. the 
temperature of the coffee
Who Drank the Last Cup!
• A little off the wall…
– Gain a history of known and previous convicted 
last cup takers
– Coffee on breath
– Offer reward to rat them out!
– Dust for the fresh fingerprints
– Are there cameras in break room?  Hallways?
– Interview of last trip to the bathroom, hold 
everyone until they have to go
The Point is
• Is there a combination of methods that 
produces a higher probability answer?
• To be efficient the investigator needs to 
choose the optimal method(s) to draw 
conclusions
• This is what experts in the field do from 
experience and instinct
Thought Experiment
• 3 digital forensic analysts of different skill 
levels are give an identical assignment
– Allowed to interact with requestor
– Requested to develop an estimate of time
– Off they go…
– Performance based on total findings, time to 
process, and estimation of time.
• Based on the way we do things now, what 
results could we expect?
Thought Experiment (2)
• What if we limited it to 20 hours?
– Reduced findings?
– More varied results?
• What about 8 hours?
– Partial results?
– Experts only?
Questions
• In the ANALYSIS phase of your favorite 
comprehensive digital forensics methodology
– How do we do a better job of maximizing our time 
with the requester?
– How do we do a better job of estimating the time 
it takes to solve open solution set problems?
– How do we optimize the methods we use to 
develop conclusions for the case goals?
– Can we achieve consistent results in the field?
Smith-Petreski Methodology
• SPM Details
– Developed for the analysis phase of digital 
investigations
– Organized by the classification of case types
– Development of goals by case type
– Evaluation and quantification of methods to 
determine optimal paths 
– Implementation of a time management framework.
– Part expert system with processes to better develop 
case goals, identify ideal methods, and set time goals
Smith-Petreski Methodology (2)
• Methodology Goals
– Better development of pre-analysis information
– Achieve better estimation of investigation 
required
– Optimize time to achieve case goals
– Provide more consistent results from teams of 
digital forensic investigators
– Provide a framework to predict analysis time, 
resources, and costs
Introduction to the Methodology
• Three Components
– Pre-analysis
• Defined case types with in-depth descriptions, common 
cases goals, typical goals for each case type, and case 
type requirements
– Analysis
• Selection of optimal methods to achieve case goals
– Structured time management
• Recommended allocation of time based on methods, 
case time given, and allows for the re-evaluation of 
methods based on results
Pre-Analysis
• Two basic request methods
– Meet with the requester
• Determination of what the requester wants or believes 
to want
• Opportunity to fine-tune the agreed upon goals
– Request form based
• Less interaction means more detailed forms or requests
• Larger shops typically require more complex 
procedures and processes to maintain the same value 
in digital forensic analysis
Pre-Analysis (2)
• Sources of case goals
– Direct and derive case goals from the initial request
• Find out how this machine was compromised (requester)
• Determine what the attacker did (analyst)
– Common goals based on case time
• Determine the vulnerability or exploit; use this information 
to identify what other systems may be compromised or at 
risk
– Case goals generated by analyst
• Could be anything, but an example is that the attacker 
searched for “Star Wars Systems,” so a follow-up case goal 
would be to identify documents related to “Star Wars 
Systems”
Pre-Analysis (3)
• SPM also includes a structure to determine 
what information should be collected during 
requester meeting based upon the case type
– Required information
• Hard drive of compromised workstation
• Logs from other systems
– Beneficial information
• Network packet captures
• Known vulnerabilities
Pre-Analysis (4)
• Improved guidance for estimating processing 
time based upon the case goals and type
– The primary data points are case size, skill level of 
examiner, and resources available.
– Our determination for the case type “Malicious 
Activity”  with fairly standard goals is 4.2 methods 
with a 20% overhead of total time
• Again, we consider this to be consistent with 
internal dialog that experts use in the field
– I can normally solve this case type using methods 
w,x,y and sometimes z, but I need 4 hours to import, 
16 hours to process, and 2 hours for reporting – plus 
some buffer… 
Case Goal Estimation Time
• Generated by specific case type and the 
number of goals
– Generated by case type and the number of case 
goal agreed upon
• 1 to 3 goals, Malicious Activity case type, 12 hours + 
process time
• 4-6 goals, Malicious Activity case type, 18 hours + 
process time
– This tries to replicate expert internal dialog
Analysis
• Now it is time to sit in front of the computer  
with your tools…
• Goal: Achieve case goals in an optimal time 
frame
• Smith Petreski Index (SPI) is an algorithm to 
assist in determining method or methods with 
the highest probability of achieving case goals
SPI Algorithm
• SPI is generated using the following data points
– Effectiveness, how likely will this method achieve your 
goal in a percentage 
– Level of effort / resources, estimated time to perform 
this method based on small, medium, large estimates
– Compatibility of toolsets, the amount of time in 
minutes to adjust, purchase, or install the 
prerequisites for this method
– Familiarity with method and toolset base on 
descriptions of novice, experienced, and expert (in 
this toolset)
Smith Petreski Index (SPI) DataFields
• For Methods
– Short Description
– Long Description
– Base effectiveness to case goal (Novice, Experienced, 
Expert)
– Analysis time in minutes for dataset size (small, med, 
large)
– Machine time in minutes for dataset size (small, med, 
large)
– Additional costs are “converted” to minutes to adjust 
methods that require a purchase, additional set-up 
time, or resources
• From this SPI and total time are derived
Goal of Generating SPI
• Choosing methods that produce the “best 
bang for the buck” to solve case goals
• We’ve developed software to provide the hard 
values, estimates, initial method sets, and to 
generate the SPI
• What we mean by “methods”
– Specifically not tool based
– Description such as “Generate Web Histories”
– We don’t want to lock in to specific tools or 
operating systems
SPI Algorithm
• Probability based
– Measures effectiveness of a method balanced 
against how long it takes execute that method in 
terms of both person and machine time, as well as 
additional costs.
