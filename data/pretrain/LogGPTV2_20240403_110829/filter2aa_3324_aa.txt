## Introduction

### The Idea
- **Inspiration**: "Mapping Process of Digital Forensic Investigation Frameworks" by Selamat, Yusof, and Sahib (IJCSNS Vol 8 No 10, Oct 2008).
- **Motivation**: Despite the existence of various methodologies, none fully aligned with the practical experiences and teachings of running a forensic team.
- **Objective**: Develop a new, practical methodology based on our processes and methods.

## Typical Digital Investigation Methodologies
- **Coverage**: Most frameworks cover the entire process from acquisition to reporting.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Obtaining authorization for investigations.
  - Determining evidence locations.
  - Validating techniques to find and interpret significant data.
  - Summarizing and explaining conclusions.

## What is a Digital Forensic Methodology?
- **DOJ Methodology**: Includes stages such as identification, preservation, examination, analysis, presentation, and decision.
- **Integrated Digital Investigation Process (IDIP)**: Developed by Carrier & Spafford (2003), it includes similar stages.
- **Enhanced IDIP**: Adds a "Dynamite" phase, as described by Baryamureeba & Tushabe (2004).

## Introduction to the Problem
- **Challenges**:
  - **Open Solution Set**: Multiple ways to find or approximate the answer.
  - **Self-Teaching**: Often involves learning on the job.
  - **Patience and Focus**: Requires staying on target and learning new techniques during an investigation.
  - **Experience Improvement**: Analysts improve over time with experience.

### Example: Last Cup of Coffee
- **Scenario**: Five individuals drinking coffee, and the pot is empty. Determine who drank the last cup.
- **Methods**:
  - Measure the amount, temperature, and strength of each coffee.
  - Analyze coffee grounds in each cup.
  - Interview individuals and groups for truthfulness.
  - Develop a timeline for coffee drinkers.
  - Measure the temperature of the cups.
  - Check for fingerprints, camera footage, and bathroom trips.

### The Point
- **Optimal Methods**: Is there a combination of methods that produces a higher probability answer?
- **Efficiency**: Investigators need to choose the most effective methods to draw conclusions.
- **Expertise**: Experienced analysts use their knowledge and instincts to select the best methods.

## Thought Experiment
- **Scenario**: Three digital forensic analysts of different skill levels are given an identical assignment.
- **Tasks**:
  - Interact with the requestor.
  - Develop an estimate of time.
  - Perform the task.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Total findings.
  - Time to process.
  - Estimation accuracy.

### Variations
- **Limited Time**:
  - **20 Hours**: Reduced findings, more varied results.
  - **8 Hours**: Partial results, experts only.

## Questions
- **In the Analysis Phase**:
  - How can we maximize our time with the requester?
  - How can we better estimate the time to solve open solution set problems?
  - How can we optimize the methods used to develop conclusions for case goals?
  - Can we achieve consistent results in the field?

## Smith-Petreski Methodology (SPM)
- **Details**:
  - Focused on the analysis phase of digital investigations.
  - Organized by the classification of case types.
  - Development of goals by case type.
  - Evaluation and quantification of methods to determine optimal paths.
  - Implementation of a time management framework.
  - Part expert system with processes to better develop case goals, identify ideal methods, and set time goals.

### Methodology Goals
- **Better Pre-Analysis Information**.
- **Improved Estimation of Investigation Requirements**.
- **Optimized Time to Achieve Case Goals**.
- **Consistent Results from Teams**.
- **Framework to Predict Analysis Time, Resources, and Costs**.

## Introduction to the Methodology
- **Three Components**:
  - **Pre-Analysis**:
    - Defined case types with in-depth descriptions, common case goals, typical goals for each case type, and case type requirements.
  - **Analysis**:
    - Selection of optimal methods to achieve case goals.
  - **Structured Time Management**:
    - Recommended allocation of time based on methods, case time given, and re-evaluation of methods based on results.

### Pre-Analysis
- **Request Methods**:
  - **Meet with the Requester**:
    - Determine what the requester wants or believes they want.
    - Fine-tune agreed-upon goals.
  - **Request Form Based**:
    - Less interaction, more detailed forms.
    - Larger organizations require more complex procedures.

- **Sources of Case Goals**:
  - Direct and derived case goals from the initial request.
  - Common goals based on case time.
  - Case goals generated by the analyst.

- **Information Collection**:
  - Required and beneficial information based on case type.

### Case Goal Estimation Time
- **Data Points**:
  - Case size, skill level of examiner, and available resources.
  - Example: For a "Malicious Activity" case with standard goals, 4.2 methods with a 20% overhead of total time.

### Analysis
- **Goal**: Achieve case goals in an optimal timeframe.
- **Smith Petreski Index (SPI)**: An algorithm to assist in determining the method(s) with the highest probability of achieving case goals.

### SPI Algorithm
- **Data Points**:
  - Effectiveness (percentage likelihood of achieving the goal).
  - Level of effort/resources (estimated time to perform the method).
  - Compatibility of toolsets (time to adjust, purchase, or install prerequisites).
  - Familiarity with method and toolset (novice, experienced, expert).

- **SPI Data Fields**:
  - Short and long descriptions.
  - Base effectiveness to case goal.
  - Analysis and machine time for dataset sizes.
  - Additional costs converted to minutes.

- **Goal of Generating SPI**:
  - Choose methods that provide the best value to solve case goals.
  - Software developed to provide hard values, estimates, initial method sets, and generate SPI.

- **Probability-Based**:
  - Measures the effectiveness of a method balanced against execution time and additional costs.
  - Function: \( f(x) = \log_2\left(\frac{1}{1-\text{effectiveness}}\right) \times \text{Inflator} - \text{machineTime} \)

This structured and detailed approach aims to enhance the efficiency and consistency of digital forensic investigations.
