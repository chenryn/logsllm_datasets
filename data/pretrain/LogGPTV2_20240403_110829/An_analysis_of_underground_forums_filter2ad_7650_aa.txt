ABSTRACT
Underground forums, where participants exchange information on
abusive tactics and engage in the sale of illegal goods and services,
are a form of online social network (OSN). However, unlike tra-
ditional OSNs such as Facebook, in underground forums the pat-
tern of communications does not simply encode pre-existing so-
cial relationships, but instead captures the dynamic trust relation-
ships forged between mutually distrustful parties. In this paper,
we empirically characterize six different underground forums —
BlackHatWorld, Carders, HackSector, HackE1ite, Freehack, and
L33tCrew — examining the properties of the social networks formed
within, the content of the goods and services being exchanged, and
lastly, how individuals gain and lose trust in this setting.

INTRODUCTION
Online social networks (OSNs) capture, in a concrete form, the
character and dynamics of human social relationships. Consequently,
the popularity of such services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) has
been followed closely by researchers using the explicit nature of
these networks to characterize social graph properties and how they
inform user interaction [6, 11]. While less well explored, there are
also a range of implicit social networks deﬁned via interaction on
other shared interaction sites (e.g., Web forums, blogs, etc.). In this
paper, we focus on a particular sub-population of such activities:
underground forums.
Users of underground forums participate in many activities simi-
lar to those found on traditional online social networks: they main-
tain proﬁles, add fellow users to buddy lists, and engage in con-
versations via private messaging. However, the “raison d’etre” for

such forums is not simply for social contact, but to support criminal
(or at best “grey hat”) activities. Thus, users of these forums regu-
larly engage in the buying, selling and trading of abusive services
and illegally obtained goods such as credit card numbers, online
currencies, compromised accounts and even drugs. However, since
underground users frequently only know each other online (and via
pseudonyms even there), they must develop new means to establish
trust among themselves.
In this paper, we examine these implicit social networks and
how they are used in the context of six underground forums —
BlackHatWorld, Carders, FreeHack, HackEl1te, HackSector, and
L33tCrew — for which we have complete activity records. Our
analysis is organized into three parts: ﬁrst, we analyze the structure
of the underlying social networks present on the forums, followed
by an examination of the commercial aspects of the sites (e.g., what
types of products are being sold, who are the most active players in
the market, etc.) and ﬁnally we look at how different reputational
factors impact behavior. We believe our work is the ﬁrst analysis
of this type and provides valuable insight into how online crimi-
nal actors create and develop social relationships in support of their
goals.
2. BACKGROUND
Online underground markets have existed in various forms for
decades. Early markets used Internet Relay Chat (IRC), documented
by Thomas et al. [10] and Franklin et al. [4], to provide a public
medium for sharing information about the availability and pricing
of goods and services (e.g., stolen credit cards, accounts, botnets,
cash out services, etc.). 1 Over time, many of these markets moved
to using persistent Web forums and expanded to cover a broader
range of information sharing. Zhuge et al. ﬁrst documented the use
of such forums in China [12] and contemporary analyses have been
published by Holt et al. [5], Radianti [7] and Fallmann et al. [3].
Over time, some of these forums have specialized and many have
moved to “closed” models (i.e., in which new members must be
explicitly vouched for by existing members); for example, Stone-
Gross et al. [9] recently documented the membership and goods on
offer on the private Spamdot.biz forum, which specialized in sup-
port for email spammers. Ultimately, the goal of all such forums is
to expand the knowledge base of the participants (e.g., which reg-
istrars will “look the other way”, how to best manipulate Google
ranking results, etc.) as well as to expand the set of potential trad-
ing partners. However, there is little public research that empirically
examines the social networks formed in such forums or the mech-
anisms employed to manage trust. Indeed, such analyses can be
difﬁcult since modern forums combine public sections, restricted
sections (requiring higher status) and person-to-person private mes-
sages (PMs) that may not be externally visible.

3. DATA OVERVIEW
In this study we have the luxury of “ground truth” — complete
records of six underground forums via SQL dumps of their under-
lying databases. We do not claim that these six are representative
of all underground forums, but they provide us with a starting point
for understanding the dynamics of underground forums. Each of
these datasets has been acquired by unknown outside parties and
made public (“leaked”) via various methods. Each forum contains
a wealth of information: user registration data, private messages
exchanged, forum posts, member status changes, banned user logs,
etc. For a more comprehensive list of the available data, please refer
to the Invision Power Board (for L33tCrew) and vBulletin database
schemas [1, 2]. We brieﬂy describe the purpose of each forum.
BlackhatWorld (BH) was founded in approximately 2005 and
is primarily English speaking. The main focus of BH is blackhat
search engine optimization (SEO), a practice in which users at-
tempt to abusively manipulate search engine algorithms to gain in-
creased page rank. At the time our dataset was obtained, BH did not
have a vibrant trading marketplace, as the site was initially oriented
towards the discussion of blackhat techniques. Today, however, the
site contains over 800 threads in the services-for-sale section and
more than 275 threads in the goods-for-sale section.
Carders (CC) is a German-speaking site primarily focused on
the monetization of stolen credit card numbers and bank account
information. The site is heavily geared towards the exchange of
goods and services. The L33tCrew (LC) forum is very similar to
CC, both in its content and the types of products exchanged.
Freehack (FH) is another German site, but does not target any
one industry. The threads on the forum cover a number of different
topics, ranging from crypting (encoding software to make detect-
ing malware more difﬁcult) to video games. Items for sale include
Steam (gaming) accounts, automatic account creators, and hacking
software. The users typically do not buy or sell stolen credentials.
The remaining sites, HackSector (HS) and HackeL1te (HL), are
similar although HL is English speaking.
Table 1 summarizes the membership and activity across each of
these forums. In total, our analysis covers over 2.5 million posts,
900k private messages, and 100k users. Our dataset also spans a
range of time periods, with the FH and HS datasets covering ap-
proximately six years, while HL is our shortest at roughly a year.
LC is our largest dataset by forum activity, with the largest number
of threads (120k), posts (860k), and private messages (500k). The
six forums exhibit different properties with regards to the number
of posts and private messages exchanged. The forums geared to-
wards commerce, CC and LC, have a much higher number of pri-
vate messages, since many business transactions occur over private
messaging. For example, we observed 23–26 PMs/user for CC and
LC, while the other four forums, whose users primarily swap infor-
mation, exhibit less than 3 PMs/user. Across all forums a fair num-
ber of “lurkers”, or individuals who simply register an account but
take no action, exist on each forum. Over 55% of the users on FH,
HS and HL are lurkers. Again, the trading forums have a smaller
fraction of lurkers with only 35% in CC and 46% in LC.
4. UNDERGROUND SOCIAL NETWORKS
In this section, we analyze the structural properties of the six
different forums. This task is nontrivial in the context of a forum,
since the deﬁnition of a link between nodes (users) remains am-
biguous. To that end, we consider three types of relationships that
exist in the forums: buddy, private message, and thread. Table 2
summarizes the basic social networking statistics for each forum.
A buddy link is the most explicit relationship that exists between
users, and is a directed link since buddy requests may be accepted,
pending, or denied. Thus, accepted requests result in symmetric
links, while pending requests produce unidirectional links. How-
ever, the number of explicitly declared buddy relationships across
the forums is quite small. Less than 10% of all users in each forum
issued a friend request to another user, suggesting that underground
forum users do not think of their relationships as persistent, or that
the members see no utility in friending other users.
Because buddy links do not fully capture the latent relationships
present in the forums, we further analyze the social network by
including links that result from private messaging. If user u1 sends
a PM to user u2, we establish a directed link from u1 to u2.
Lastly, thread relationships result when two users post in the
same sub-forum thread. To establish these links, we order all posts
in the same thread by their post times. We then create a link from
user u2 to user u1 if u2 posted after u1, with the reasoning being
that u2 is interacting with all users in the thread prior to his or her
post. Unsurprisingly, Table 2 shows that these one-to-many thread
relationships produce the most links and fewest weakly connected
components. One may use more advanced techniques (e.g., parsing
“[QUOTE]” and “@” expressions) to establish ﬁner-
grained thread relationships, but we leave this to future work.
