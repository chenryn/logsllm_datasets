ABSTRACT
In this study, we present WindTalker, a novel and practi-
cal keystroke inference framework that allows an attacker
to infer the sensitive keystrokes on a mobile device through
WiFi-based side-channel information. WindTalker is moti-
vated from the observation that keystrokes on mobile devices
will lead to diﬀerent hand coverage and the ﬁnger motions,
which will introduce a unique interference to the multi-path
signals and can be reﬂected by the channel state informa-
tion (CSI). The adversary can exploit the strong correlation
between the CSI ﬂuctuation and the keystrokes to infer the
user’s number input. WindTalker presents a novel approach
to collect the target’s CSI data by deploying a public WiFi
hotspot. Compared with the previous keystroke inference
approach, WindTalker neither deploys external devices close
to the target device nor compromises the target device. In-
stead, it utilizes the public WiFi to collect user’s CSI data,
which is easy-to-deploy and diﬃcult-to-detect. In addition,
it jointly analyzes the traﬃc and the CSI to launch the
keystroke inference only for the sensitive period where pass-
word entering occurs. WindTalker can be launched without
the requirement of visually seeing the smart phone user’s in-
put process, backside motion, or installing any malware on
the tablet. We implemented Windtalker on several mobile
phones and performed a detailed case study to evaluate the
practicality of the password inference towards Alipay, the
largest mobile payment platform in the world. The evalua-
tion results show that the attacker can recover the key with
a high successful rate.

INTRODUCTION
Smartphones and tablets are commonly used for perform-
ing privacy sensitive transactions of banking, payment, and
social applications. Unlike stationary devices connecting to
a secure network and sitting in a physically-secure space,
these mobile devices are often carried by a mobile user and
connected to a dynamic network environment where attack-
ers can physically approach the target user’s device and
launch various direct and indirect eavesdropping attacks.
While direct eavesdropping attacks aim at directly observ-
ing the input of the target device from screen and keyboard,
indirect eavesdropping attacks, a.k.a. side-channel attacks
make use of side channels to infer the inputs on the target
devices. Prior works [2, 3, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 23, 25] have
shown that both types of attacks can be eﬀective in cer-
tain situations. Particularly for the side-channel attacks, it
is shown that the PIN and the words entered at keyboard
can be inferred from the acoustic signal at microphone [3,
12, 25], electromagnetic signal at radio antenna [2], visible
light at camera [18, 23], and motion status at motion sensors
[13, 15, 16]. To access the side channels, these works often
assume either external signal collector devices are close to
the target device (for example, 30 cm) or the sensors of the
target devices are compromised to provide side channel in-
formation. However, in a mobile scenario, either assumption
is hardly true and the impact of attacks is thus limited. In
addition, the prior works [2, 3, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 23, 25]
have studied the keystroke inference aiming at achieving a
high inference accuracy on a series of keystrokes during a
relatively-long period of time. However, the keystrokes on
a mobile device are not always highly sensitive. Obviously,
the eavesdropping attacker has a greater interest in obtain-
ing the payment PIN number in a short moment than a
regular typing. Therefore, the application context informa-
tion also needs to be considered in the keystroke inference
framework. We will show how to use application context to
increase the inference eﬀectiveness.
We present WindTalker, a novel and practical keystroke
inference framework that allows an attacker to infer the sen-
sitive keystrokes on a mobile device through WiFi signals.
WindTalker is motivated from the observation that the typ-
ing activity on mobile devices involves hand and the ﬁn-
ger motions, which produce a recognizable interference to
the multi-path WiFi signals from the target device to the
WiFi router that connects to the device. Unlike prior side-
channel attacks or traditional CSI based gesture recognition,
WindTalker neither deploys external devices close to the tar-
1068get device nor compromises any part of the target device;
instead, WindTalker setups a ‘rogue’ hotspot to lure the
target user with free WiFi service, which is easy-to-deploy
and diﬃcult-to-detect. As long as the target device is con-
nected to the hotspot, WindTalker at the hotspot intercepts
the traﬃc and time-adaptively collect the channel state in-
formation (CSI) between the target device and the hotspot.
The design of WindTalker faces three major technical chal-
lenges.
i) The impact of the hand and ﬁnger movement of
keystrokes on CSI waveforms is very subtle. An eﬀective
signal analysis method is needed to analyze keystrokes from
the limited CSI. ii) The prior CSI collection method requires
two WiFi devices, one as a signal sender and the other as
a signal receiver, which are deployed close to the victim. A
more ﬂexible and practical CSI collection method is highly
desirable for the mobile device scenario. iii) The key infer-
ence must be done at some selective moments for obtaining
a sensitive keystroke, such as payment PIN number. Such
context-oriented CSI collection has not been addressed by
prior works. In this paper, We introduce a novel CSI based
keystroke inference framework, which consists of four specif-
ical contributions.
• We present a practical CSI collection method using
public WiFi architecture without compromising the
victim’s device or deploying an external device very
close to the victim’s device. The victim’s device is
connected to a WiFi hotspot that stealthily collects the
CSI from the victim’s device by enforcing the ICMP
protocol. We further adopt the directional antenna
to eliminate CSI noises introduced by other factors in
public places, such as other people’s movement.
• We propose a keystroke recognition algorithm based
on the collected CSI. Speciﬁcally, we adopt low pass
ﬁlter to remove the high frequency noises and we use
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the
dimensionality of the feature vectors.
• We propose a context-oriented CSI collection method,
which employs both of the traﬃc analysis towards meta
data in WiFi traﬃc and CSI data analysis to recognize
the PIN input moment based on certain CSI tags. The
proposed method can be used to successfully ﬁgure out
the time of the PIN entry on Alipay (a popular mobile
payment platform in China) and launch the keystroke
recognition accordingly.
• We perform an extensive evaluation on keystroke in-
ference towards PIN input at the mobile payment pro-
cess, which is secured by the HTTPS protocol and thus
traditionally believed to be secure. Through our eval-
uation, we demonstrate that the attacker can infer the
PIN number at a high successful rate.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to
launch the keystroke inference towards PIN entry at the
mobile payment (e.g., Alipay). The remainder of this pa-
per is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the
background of this work.
In Section 3, we introduce the
research motivation by showing the correlation of keystroke
and CSI changing. We present the detailed design in Section
4, which is followed by Evaluation, Real-world experiment,
Discussion and Related work in Section 5, 6, 7 and 8, re-
spectively. Finally, we give the conclusion and future work
in Section 9.

2. BACKGROUND
In this section, we introduce the scenario, the overview of
the keystroke inference methods, and preliminaries of chan-
nel state information.
2.1 Scenario
We consider a scenario where a user has a mobile device,
such as a smartphone, or a tablet and he or she is using
the public free WiFi through the device. It is a very com-
mon situation that people could have in the shopping mall,
the airport, and restaurants. A WiFi hotspot is set up at a
corner or on the ceiling, an unnoticeable location from the
user’s view. The user searches all the available WiFi sig-
nals at her device, and may choose to use the WiFi network
if the name of the network “looks” good and the network
is authentication-free. With the application layer security
(HTTPs), the user may believe that the Internet traﬃc is
protected from end-to-end such that the content shown at
the device and the user’s inputs at the device will be only
available to herself and the service provider. However, as
we will show, our WindTalker framework suggests eﬀective
keystroke inference methods targeting at the mobile device.
2.2
In-band keystroke inference model
WindTalker chooses In-band keystroke inference (IKI) model.
As shown in Fig.1(a), WindTalker deploys one Commercial
Oﬀ-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi device close to the target de-
vice, which could be a WiFi hotspot. The WiFi hotspot
provides free WiFi networks for nearby users. When a user
connects her device to the hotspot, the WiFi hotspot is able
to monitor the application context by checking the pattern
of the transmitted packets. In addition, the WiFi hotspot
periodically sends ICMP packets to obtain the CSI infor-
mation from the target device. With the meta data of the
WiFi traﬃc, the hotspot knows when the sensitive opera-
tions happen. And then, the hotspot adaptively launches
CSI-based keystroke inference method to recognize sensitive
key inputs. To the best of our knowledge, the IKI method we
propose is the ﬁrst one using existing network protocols of
IEEE 802.11n/ac standard to obtain the application context
and the CSI information at mobile devices.
Note that the existing works about CSI based gesture
recognition choose another strategy: Out-of-band keystroke
inference (OKI) model[2]. In this model, the adversary de-
ploys two COTS WiFi devices close to the target device and
makes sure the target device is placed right between two
COTS WiFi devices. One is the sender device continuously
emitting signals and the other one is the receiver device con-
tinuously receiving the signals. The keystrokes are inferred
from the multi-path distortions in signals.
Compared with OKI model, the proposed IKI model has
the below advantages. Firstly, compared with OKI model,
1069IKI model does not require the placement of both sender
and receicer device and can be deployed in a more ﬂexible
and stealthy way. Secondly, OKI model fails to diﬀerentiate
the non-sensitive operations on mobile devices (e.g., clicking
the screen to open an APP or just for web-browsing) from
sensitive operation (e.g., inputting the password). Instead,
IKI model allows the attacker to obtain both of un-encrypted
meta data traﬃc as well as the CSI data to launch a more
ﬁne-grained attack.
2.3 Channel State Information
The basic goal of WindTalker is measuring the impact of
hand and ﬁngers’s movement on WiFi signals and leveraging
correlation of CSI and the unique hand motion to recognize
PIN. In the below, we brieﬂy introduce the CSI related back-
grounds.
WiFi Standards like IEEE 802.11n/ac all support Multiple-
Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (OFDM), which are expected to sig-
niﬁcantly improve the channel capacity of the wireless sys-
tem. In a system with transmitter antenna number NT X ,
receiver antenna number NRX and OFDM subcarriers num-
ber Ns, system will useN T X × NRX × Ns subcarriers to
transmit signal at the same time.
CSI measures Channel Frequency Response (CFR) in dif-
ferent subcarriers f . CFR H (f, t) represents the state of
wireless channel in a signal transmission process. Let X (f, t)
and Y (f, t) represent the transmitted and received signal
with diﬀerent subcarrier frequency. H (f, t) can be calcu-
lated in receiver using a known transmitted signal via
H (f, t) =
Y (f, t)
X (f, t)
Since the received signal reﬂects the constructive and de-
structive interference of several multi-path signals scattered
from the wall and surrounding objects, the movements of
the ﬁngers while password input can generate a unique pat-
tern in the time-series of CSI values, which can be used for
keystrokes recognition.
Many commercial devices such as Atheros 9390 [17], Atheros
9580 [22] and Intel 5300 [8] network interface cards (NICs)
with special drivers provide open access to CSI value.
In
this study, we adopt Intel 5300 NICs, which follows IEEE
802.11n standard [1] and can work in 2.4GHz or 5GHz. By
selecting Ns = 30 OFDM subcarriers, Intel 5300 NICs col-
lect CSI value for each TX-RX antenna pair.
3. MOTIVATION
In this section, we illustrate the rationale behind CSI
based keystroke inference on smart phones using real-world
experiments. Fig.2(a) shows the sketch of typical touching
screen during the PIN entry for mobile payment (e.g., Alipay
or Wechat pay). We particularly focus on the vertical touch
and the oblique touch, which are two most common touching
gestures [4, 7, 20]. As shown in the left of Fig.2(b), oblique
touch is the most common typing gesture, which happens
when people press diﬀerent keys. Vertical touch usually hap-
pens when the human continuously presses the same key,
(e.g., continuously pressing 1) in the right of Fig.2(b).
We further investigate how these two common typing ges-
tures inﬂuence CSI. Generally speaking, since CSI reﬂects
the constructive and destructive interference of several multi-
path signals, the change of multi-path propagation during
