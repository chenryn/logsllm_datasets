Figure 6: The ten largest virtual-hosted scams and the
number of IP addresses hosting the scams.
We count multiple scam hosting from two perspec-
tives, the number of virtual hosts used by a scam and
the number of unique IP addresses used by those virtual
hosts. Overall, the scams from our trace are typically
hosted on a single IP address with one domain name.
Of the 2,334 scams, 2,195 (94%) were hosted on a sin-
gle IP address and 1,960 (84%) were hosted on a sin-
gle domain name. Only a small fraction of scams use
multiple hosting. Figure 5 shows the tails of the distri-
butions of the number of virtual hosts and IP addresses
used by the scams in our trace, and Table 6 lists the top
ten scams with the largest number of domains and IP ad-
dresses. Roughly 10% of the scams use three or more
virtual domains, and 1% use 15 or more. The top scams
use hundreds of virtual domains, with one scam using
over 3,000. Of the 6% of scams hosted on multiple IP
addresses, only a few used more than ten, with one scam
using 45. The relatively prevalent use of virtual hosts
suggests that scammers are likely concerned about URL
blacklisting and use distinct virtual hosts in URLs sent in
different spam messages to defeat such blacklists.
The scams in our trace do not use hosting infrastruc-
ture distributed across the network extensively. Most
scams are hosted on a single IP address, providing a po-
tentially convenient single point for network-based in-
terdiction either via IP blacklisting or network ﬁltering.
Assuming that scammers adapt to defenses to remain ef-
fective, such ﬁltering does not appear to be applied ex-
tensively. Scam serving workloads are apparently low
enough that a single host can satisfy offered load sufﬁ-
ciently to reap the beneﬁts of the scam. Finally, if scams
do use botnets as hosting infrastructure, then they are not
used to scale a single scam. A scammer could poten-
tially use a botnet to host multiple different scams, host-
ing each scam on a separate distinct bot, but our method-
ology would not identify this case.
Those few scams hosted on multiple IP addresses,
however, are highly distributed. Scams with multiple
IP addresses were most commonly distributed outside of

the same /24 preﬁx. Of the 139 distributed scams, all
the hosts in 86% of the scams were located entirely on
distinct /24 networks. Moreover, 64% of the distributed
scams had host IP addresses that were all in entirely
different ASes. As an example, one distributed scam
was a phishing attack targeting a bank. The phishing
Web pages were identical across 14 hosts, all in different
/24 networks. The attack employed 91 distinct domain
names. The domain names followed the same naming
convention using a handful of common keywords fol-
lowed by a set of numbers, suggesting the hosts were all
involved in the distributed attack. The fully distributed
nature of these scams suggests that scammers were con-
cerned about resilience to defenses such as blacklisting.
5.3 Shared infrastructure
While we found that most scams are hosted on a single
machine, a related question is whether these individual
machines in turn host multiple scams, thereby sharing
infrastructure across them. For each hosting IP address
in our trace, we counted the number of unique scams
hosted on that IP address at any time in the trace. Fig-
ure 7 shows these results as a logscale histogram. Shared
infrastructure is rather prevalent: although 1,450 scams
(62%) were hosted on their own machines, the remaining
38% of scams were hosted on machines hosting at least
one other scam. Ten servers hosted ten or more scams,
and the top three machines hosted 22, 18, and 15 differ-
ent scams. This sharing of infrastructure suggests that
scammers frequently either run multiple different scams
on hosts that they control, or that hosts are made avail-
able (sold, rented, bartered) to multiple scammers.

5.3.1 Sharing over time
We further examined these shared servers to determine
if they host different scams sequentially or if, in fact,
servers are used concurrently for different scams. For
each pair of scams hosted on the same IP address, we
compared their active times and durations with each
other. When they overlapped, we calculated the duration
of overlap. We found that scams sharing hosts shared
them at the same time: 96% of all pairs of scams over-
lapped with each other when they remained active. Fig-
ure 8 shows the distribution of time for which scams
overlapped. Over 50% of pairs of scams overlapped
for at least 125 hours. Further calculating the ratio of
time that scams sharing hosts were active, we found that
overlapped scams did not necessarily start and end at the
same time: only 10% of scam pairs fully overlapped each
other.
5.3.2 Sharing between scam hosts and spam relays
More broadly, how often do the same machines serve as
both spam relays as well as scam hosting? Hosts used
for both spam and scams suggest, for instance, that ei-
ther the spammer and the scammer are the same party,
or that a third party controls the infrastructure and makes
it available for use by different clients. We can only es-
timate the extent to which hosts play both roles, but we

estimate it in two ways. First, we determine the IP ad-
dresses of all of the hosts that send spam into our feed.
We then compare those addresses with the IP addresses
of the scam hosts. Based upon this comparison, we ﬁnd
only a small amount of overlap (9.7%) between the scam
hosts and spam relays in our trace.
Scam hosts could, of course, serve as spam relays that
do not happen to send spam to our feed. For a more
global perspective, we identify whether the spam and
scam hosts we observe in our trace are blacklisted on
well-known Internet blacklists. When the prober sees an
IP address for the ﬁrst time (either from a host sending
spam or from a scam host), it performs a blacklist query
on that IP address using the DNSBLLookup Perl mod-
ule [16].
Table 3 shows the percentage of blacklisted spam re-
lays and scam hosts. This perspective identiﬁes a larger
percentage (17%) of scam hosts as also sending spam
than we found by comparing scam hosts and open relays
within our spam feed, but the percentage is still small
overall. The blacklists are quite effective, though, at clas-
sifying the hosts that send spam to our feed: 78% of those
hosts are blacklisted. The query identiﬁes most of the
spam hosts as open spam relays — servers that forward
mail and mask the identity of the true sender — whereas
most blacklisted scam hosts are identiﬁed as just send-
ing spam directly. These results suggest that when scam
hosts are also used to send spam, they are rarely used as
an open spam service.
5.4 Lifetime
Next we examine how long scams remain active and, in
the next section, how stable they are while active. The
lifetime of a scam is a balance of competing factors.
Scammers have an incentive to use hosting infrastructure
that provides longer lifetimes and higher availability to
increase their rate of return. On the other hand, for exam-
ple, numerous community and commercial services pro-
vide feeds and products to help network administrators
identify, ﬁlter or take down some scam sites, particularly
phishing scams [1,6,22,25].
We deﬁne the lifetime of a scam as the time between
the ﬁrst and last successful timestamp for a probe opera-
tion during the two-week measurement period, indepen-
dent of whether any probes failed in between (we look
at the effect of failed probe attempts on availability be-
low). We use two types of probes to examine scam host
lifetime from different perspectives (Section 4). Periodic
ping probes measure host network lifetime, and periodic
HTTP requests measure scam server lifetime. Recall that
we probe all hosts for a week after they appear in our
spam feed — and no longer — to remove any bias to-
wards hosts that appear early in the measurement study.

Figure 9: Lifetimes of individual scam hosts and Web
servers, as well overall lifetimes of scams across multiple
hosts.
For comparison, we also calculate the lifetimes of entire
scams. For scams that use multiple hosts, their lifetimes
start when the ﬁrst host appears in our trace and end with
the lifetime of the last host to respond. As a result, scam
lifetimes can exceed a week.
How long are scams active? Figure 9 shows the dis-
tributions of scam lifetime based upon these probes for
the scams in our trace. For ping probes, we show the
distribution of just those scam hosts that responded to
pings (67% of all scam hosts). Scam hosts had long net-
work lifetimes. Over 50% of hosts responded to pings for
nearly the entire week that we probed them, and fewer
than 10% of hosts responded to pings for less than 80
hours. Given how close the distributions are, scam Web
servers had only slightly shorter lifetimes overall. These
results suggest that scam hosts are taken down soon after
scam servers.
Comparing the distribution of scam lifetimes to the
others, we see that scams beneﬁt from using multiple
hosts. The 50% of scams whose lifetimes exceed a week
indicate that the lifetimes of the individual scam hosts
do not entirely overlap each other.
Indeed, individual
hosts for some scams appeared throughout the week of
our measurement study, and the overall scam lifetime ap-
proached the two weeks.
5.4.1 Lifetime by category
A substantial amount of community and commercial ef-
fort goes into identifying malicious sites, such as phish-
ing scams, and placing those sites on URL or DNS/IP
blacklists. Thus, we would expect that the hosting in-
frastructure for clearly malicious scams would be more
transient than for other scams. To test this hypothesis,
we used the categorization of scams to create a group
of malicious scams that include the “Illegal or Question-

able” and “Phishing” categories labeled by the Web con-
tent ﬁlter (32 scams). For comparison, we also broke out
another group of more innocuous shopping scams that
include the “Shopping”, “Information Technology”, and
“Auction” categories (701 scams).
We examined the lifetimes and prevalence on black-
lists of these scams. Figure 10 shows the lifetime distri-
butions of the malicious and shopping groups of scams,
and includes the distribution of all scams from Figure 9
for reference. The malicious scams have a noticeably
shorter lifetime than the entire population, and the shop-
ping scams have a slightly longer lifetime. Over 40%
of the malicious scams persist for less than 120 hours,
whereas the lifetime for the same percentage of shopping
scams was 180 hours and the median for all scams was
155 hours. These results are consistent with malicious
scam sites being identiﬁed and taken down faster than
other scam sites, although we cannot verify the causality.
As further evidence, we also examined the prevalence
of malicious scams on the DNS blacklists we use in Sec-
tion 5.3.2, and compare it to the blacklisting prevalence
of all scams and the shopping scams. Over 28% of the
malicious scams were blacklisted, roughly twice as often
as the shopping scams (12% blacklisted) and all scams
(15%). Again, these results are consistent with the life-
times of malicious scams — being blacklisted twice as
frequently could directly result in shorter scam lifetimes.
5.4.2 Spam campaign lifetime
A related aspect to scam lifetime are the “spam cam-
paigns” used to advertise scams and attract clients. We
captured 319,700 spam emails with links in our trace,
