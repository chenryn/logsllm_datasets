original intuition that proxies are likely to be hosted in countries
where server hosting is easy to acquire.
We might also like to know if some providers are more reliable
than others. Figure 19 shows, for each provider, a map of the world
with each country color-coded according to the overall honesty of
the provider’s claims for that country. If a country is drawn in white,
the provider didn’t claim to have any proxies in that country to
begin with. Bright green means all of the claimed proxies’ CBG++
predictions overlap the country at least somewhat—that is, the
“yes” or “uncertain” categories in Figure 17, after taking data center
locations into account. Dark purple means none of the predictions
overlap the country at all. Colors in between mean CBG++ backs
up the claim for some but not all of the proxies claimed to be in
that country.
There is some variation among the providers; for instance, C and
E are actually hosting servers in more than one country of South
America, whereas providers A and B just say they are. However,
claimed locations in countries where server hosting is difficult are
almost always false. Even in regions like Western Europe, where
hosting is available in any country one would like, providers seem
to prefer to concentrate their hosts in a few locations.
6.1 Data Centers and Prediction Error
Groups of proxies that we believe are all in the same data center
can be used for another check on the accuracy of our geolocation
methods. We are not yet certain enough of our data center groups
to run this analysis on all of the grouped proxies, but we can discuss
the results for a clear-cut case like AS63128. If geolocation worked
perfectly, all of the regions shown in Figure 16 ought to be the
same, but clearly they are not; there isn’t even a single sub-region
that they all cover. Since our two-phase procedure uses a different
randomly-selected group of landmarks for each measurement, vari-
ation is to be expected. Figure 20 shows that there is no correlation
between the size of each prediction region, and the distance to the
nearest landmark for that region from the centroid of all the pre-
dictions taken together. This means the variation is not simply due
to geographic distance; it may instead be due to some landmarks
experiencing more congestion or routing detours than others.

6.2 Comparison with ICLab and IP-to-Location
Databases
Active geolocation has been applied to proxy servers once before, as
part of a larger project, ICLab, to automate monitoring for Internet
censorship across the entire world [39]. We contacted them and
they provided us with their data for comparison.
ICLab’s geolocation checker only attempts to prove that each
proxy is not in the claimed country. It assumes that it is impossible
for a packet to have traveled faster than a configurable speed limit;
their actual tests used 153 km/ms (0.5104 c) for this limit (slightly
faster than the “speed of internet” described in Katz-Bassett et al.
[25]). Given a country where a host is claimed to be, and a set of
round-trip measurements, ICLab’s checker calculates the minimum
distance between each landmark and the claimed country, then
checks how fast a packet would have had to travel to cover that
distance in the observed time. The claimed location is only accepted
if none of the packets had to travel faster than the limit.
Figure 21 shows the percentage of overall claims by each proxy
provider that our algorithm, ICLab’s algorithm, and five popular
IP-to-location databases agree with. The numbers for CBG++ are
calculated two ways: “generous” means we assume that all of the
“uncertain” cases are actually credible, and “strict” means we as-
sume they are all false. ICLab’s algorithm is even stricter than ours,
but most of that is explained by our more subtle handling of uncer-
tain cases. Our “strict” numbers are usually within 10% of ICLab’s.
Looking more deeply into the disagreements reveals that CBG++
almost always predicts a location close to a national border—just
the situation where either algorithm could be tripped up by an
underestimate.
All five of the IP-to-location databases are more likely to agree
with the providers’ claims than either active-geolocation approach
is. As discussed earlier, we are inclined to suspect that this is be-
cause the proxy providers have influenced the information in these
databases. We have no hard evidence backing this suspicion, but
we observe that there is no pattern to the countries for which the

We have also put to the test the location claims of seven major
commercial proxy operators. Our findings are dire: advertised server
locations cannot be relied upon, especially when the operators claim
to have servers in locations where server hosting is difficult. At most
70% of the servers are where their operators say they are, and that
is giving them the full benefit of the doubt; we can only confidently
confirm the providers’ claims for about 50% of the servers, and
all of those are in countries where hosting is easy. Provider A is
especially misleading, but all seven of the providers we evaluated
had at least a couple of questionable hosts. We shared our results
with the providers and asked for an explanation, but all of them
declined to respond.
IP-to-location databases disagree with provider claims. This is what
we would expect to see if the databases were being influenced,
but with some lag-time. As the proxy providers add servers, the
databases default their locations to a guess based on IP address
registry information, which, for commercial data centers, may be
reasonably close to the truth. When the database services attempt
to make a more precise assessment, this draws on the source that
the providers can influence.
7 RELATED WORK
Existing “measurement networks” such as PlanetLab [37], RIPE At-
las [41], or CAIDA Ark [6] have poor coverage outside Europe and
North America, and at their best they only offer enough landmarks
for city-scale geolocation. Wang et al. [44] propose to increase
landmark density to the point where “street-level” geolocation is
feasible, by enlisting small businesses’ Web servers as additional
landmarks, on the assumption that each server is physically located
at the street address of the business. They apply heuristics to ex-
clude sites on shared hosting and centralized corporate networks.
Chen et al. [8] improves on this by using constrained mean-square
error optimization to validate and fine-tune the location of each
street-level server.
As we mentioned in Section 2, researchers in this field have de-
voted considerable effort to modeling the minimum and maximum
feasible distance for each round-trip time measurement. Another
line of research involves incorporating other sources of information
as well as end-to-end round-trip time measurements. The original
Octant (not the reimplementation in this paper) assumes that the
target’s LAN is probably small and any time spent within it is pure
overhead, so it uses traceroute information to subtract off elapsed
time up to the point where the routes begin to diverge. Komosny
et al. [27] elaborated on this by using the Vivaldi [9] “network co-
ordinate system” to model all of the observed distances between
intermediate routers, but did not find an improvement over CBG.
On the other hand, TBG [25] reports substantial improvements over
CBG by using constrained optimization to do the same thing.
Eriksson et al. [15] recommends taking into account prior knowl-
edge (in the Bayesian sense) about where a target host can plausi-
bly be, such as geography (“must be on land”), population density
(“more likely to be in a large city”), or known locations of data
centers. Alidade [7] builds on this concept, drawing on both active
measurements and passive data sources to compile a database that
can be queried as easily as a traditional IP-to-location database, but
with improved accuracy. OpenIPMap [10] has similar goals and
also makes use of crowdsourced location reports.
8 DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated the viability of a simple algorithm for active
geolocation, CBG++, at global scale, especially when it is possible to
use a crude location estimate to select landmarks within the same
continent as the target. We have also confirmed that it is possible
to geolocate proxy servers, even when they cannot be directly
pinged. Our implementation of the four geolocation algorithms,
as well as our measurement code, is publicly available at https:
//github.com/zackw/active-geolocator.

Our results call into question the validity of any network mea-
surement that used VPNs to gain location diversity, especially
to diversify beyond Europe and North America. Also, despite a
steady stream of reports that IP-to-location databases are unreli-
able (e.g. [18, 38, 42]) they are still relied upon in numerous contexts;
we add our voices to those earlier notes of caution.
As we mentioned in the introduction, many of a VPN provider’s
customers might be content to appear to be in a specific country.
We are not aware of anyone having investigated what VPN cus-
tomers think they are buying, when they subscribe to a provider
that advertises servers in many countries. It would be interesting
to find out. Relatedly, while it is well-known that commercial IP-
to-location databases contain errors, we are not aware of anyone
having investigated the possibility of their containing deliberately
false information (perhaps because the database compilers them-
selves were deceived).
One might also wonder whether the VPN operators could ac-
tively mislead investigators about the true location of their servers,
by interfering with round-trip time measurements. They have no
particular reason to do this now, but if active location validation
becomes common, they might be motivated to try it. Previous work
has found that hostile geolocation targets can indeed foul a posi-
tion estimate. Gill et al. [19] and others [2, 33] report that selective
added delay can displace the predicted region, so that its centroid is
nowhere near the target’s true location; more sophisticated delay-
distance models are more susceptible to this, especially if they
derive minimum as well as maximum feasible distances from delay
measurements. Abdou et al. [3] go further, describing two methods
for modifying ICMP echo replies so that some landmarks compute
smaller round-trip times than they should; with this ability, an ad-
versarial target can shift the predicted region to be anywhere in
the world, irrespective of its true location.
Our measurements use TCP handshakes, which include anti-
forgery measures, rather than ICMP echo exchanges; also, we can
trust both the landmarks and the host running the measurement
tool. It is the VPN proxy, in the middle, that is the target of geoloca-
tion and not trusted. Unfortunately, being in the middle means it is
easier for a proxy target to manipulate RTTs both up and down, than
it was for an end-host target as considered by Abdou et al. It can
selectively delay packets, and it can also selectively forge early SYN-
ACKs without needing to guess sequence numbers, since it sees the
SYNs. Conceivably, we could prevent this by using landmarks that
report their own idea of the time, unforgeably, e.g. authenticated
NTP servers [13]—if we could be sure that our measurement client

and all of the landmarks already had synchronized clocks, which is
a substantial engineering challenge in itself.
Finally, our Web-based measurement technique could be used to
geolocate any visitor to a malicious website without their knowl-
edge or consent. This would be foiled by the use of a proxy, VPN,
Tor, or similar, in much the same way that IP-based geolocation is
foiled by masking one’s IP address with these tools. However, it
is still an argument against allowing Web applications to record
high-precision information about page load timings, and we plan
to discuss this with the major browser vendors.
8.1 Future work
We were only able to include seven VPN providers in this study;
there are at least 150 others, some of which make claims nearly
as extravagant as provider A. We intend to expand the study to
cover as many additional providers as possible, in cooperation
with researchers and consumer watchdog organizations looking
into other ways commercial VPN providers may fail to live up
to their users’ expectations. This will also allow us to repeat the
measurements over time, and report on whether providers become
more or less honest as the wider ecosystem changes.
In order to understand the errors added to our position estimates
by the indirect measurement procedure described in Section 5.3,
we are planning to set up test-bench VPN servers of our own, in
known locations worldwide, and attempt to measure their locations
both directly and indirectly.
While our two-phase measurement process is fast and efficient,
it also produces noisy groups of measurements like those shown
in Figure 16. We think this can be addressed with an iterative
refinement process, in which additional probes and anchors are
included in the measurement as necessary to reduce the size of the
predicted region.
We are experimenting with an additional technique for detecting
proxies in the same data center, in which we measure round-trip
times to each proxy from each other proxy. Pilot tests indicate that
some groups of proxies (including proxies claimed to be in separate
countries) show less than 5 ms round-trip times among themselves,
