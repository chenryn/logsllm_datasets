 "A": "Documenting all discovered code paths and testing each path individually, including decision branches and combinatorial analysis."
 "B": "Using a single method, such as race conditions testing, to cover all possible paths and data manipulations concurrently."
 "C": "Relying solely on automatic spidering tools to document the application's links and to infer code paths indirectly."
 "D": "Conducting data flow analysis to track how data is assigned, transformed, and utilized across the application."
Answer: AD
