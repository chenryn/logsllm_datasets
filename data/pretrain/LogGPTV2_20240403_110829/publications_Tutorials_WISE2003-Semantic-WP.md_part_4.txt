Operational Metrics Specification
 Operational metrics are described using a QoS
model represented with a suitable ontology.
The specification of Web services

operational metrics allows the analysis
and computation processes QoS.
Processes can be designed according
to QoS objectives and requirements.
This allows organizations to translate
their strategies into their processes Web Service Annotation
more efficiently.

Creation of Estimates
QoS
To analyze a process QoS, it is necessary
to:
Create estimated for task QoS metrics and
Create estimated for transition probabilities
Once tasks and transitions have their estimates set,
algorithms and mechanisms, such as simulation, can be
applied to compute the overall QoS of a process.

Simulation
While mathematical methods can be effectively
used, another alternative is to utilize simulation
analysis1.
Simulation can play an important role in tuning the
QoS metrics of processes by exploring “what-if”
questions.
In our project, these capabilities involve a loosely-
coupled integration between the METEOR WfMS
and the JSIM simulation system2.

 QoS Semantics
Web processes vs. Semantic Web processes
 BPEL4WS vs. DAML-S

Conclusions
 Present Problems in Process Composition
 Static discovery of Web Services
 Design/deployment-time binding of Web services
 Process Composition is based on interfaces of participating services
 Proposition
 Semantics is the enabler to address the problems of scalability,
heterogeneity (syntactic and semantic), machine understandability
faced by Web services
 Semantics for Web Services
 Semantics can be applied to different layers of Web Services
conceptual stack
 Semantics for Web Services can be categorized into at least 4 different
dimensions namely Data, Functional, Execution and Quality (QoS).
130
131
Conclusions
Semantics can help address big challenges related to
scalability, dynamic environments.
But comprehensive approach to semantics will be
needed:
 Data/information, function/operation, execution, QoS
Semantic (Web) principles and technology bring new
tools and capabilities that we did not have in EAI,
workflow management of the past
