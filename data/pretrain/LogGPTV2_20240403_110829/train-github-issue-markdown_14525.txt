### Environment Details

- **Apache Airflow Version**: 2.0.1
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration**: Google Cloud Platform Compute Engine
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (Focal Fossa)
- **Kernel**: Linux finance-airflow 5.4.0-1041-gcp #44-Ubuntu SMP Fri Mar 26 03:53:35 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- **Installation Tool**: pip

### Issue Description

**What Happened**:
When installing Apache Airflow using the standard command `pip install apache-airflow`, version 2.0.1 of Airflow was installed, which requires `sqlalchemy` version 1.3.18. However, `pip` installed `sqlalchemy` version 1.4.6. This led to an import error when attempting to initialize the database with the command `airflow db init`.

**Error Message**:
```
from sqlalchemy.orm.query import _ColumnEntity
ImportError: cannot import name '_ColumnEntity' from 'sqlalchemy.orm.query'
(/home/foo/airflow/.direnv/python-3.8.5/lib/python3.8/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/query.py)
```

**Expected Behavior**:
The expected behavior is that the `sqlite3` database should be initialized successfully for testing purposes.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Install Apache Airflow on Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS using the following command:
   ```
   pip install apache-airflow
   ```
2. Attempt to initialize the database:
   ```
   airflow db init
   ```

### Additional Information

- Downgrading `sqlalchemy` to version 1.3.18 via `pip install --upgrade sqlalchemy==1.3.18` resolves the issue and allows the database to be initialized.
- It is expected that the correct dependencies should be handled by the `setup.py` file in the `apache-airflow` package. Therefore, it is suggested that the `setup.py` file for the `apache-airflow` version in PyPI be updated to ensure compatibility with the required `sqlalchemy` version.
