Question: "Consider an application design where a use case diagram illustrates a user entering a username and password to authenticate, and a misuse case diagram depicts an attacker extracting valid usernames by analyzing authentication error messages. Which of the following countermeasures would NOT be effective in mitigating the threat posed by the attacker's actions?"
 "A": "Introducing a time delay after each failed authentication attempt to slow down brute force attacks."
 "B": "Providing generic error messages to avoid giving away information about valid or invalid usernames."
 "C": "Locking user accounts for a period of time after several consecutive failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks."
 "D": "Implementing a CAPTCHA system that must be solved after each failed login to distinguish between human users and automated scripts."
Answer: D
