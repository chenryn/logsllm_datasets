User: How to optimize and control network traffic by configuring a load balancer to improve system availability and performance.
Assistant: 1. Select an appropriate load balancing algorithm, and select different load balancing algorithms according to business scenarios and load conditions. Common load balancing algorithms include round robin, weighted round robin, minimum number of connections, shortest response time, etc. 2. Set the health check function to detect the status of service nodes through periodic detection, and automatically eliminate faulty nodes to ensure the stability of the load balancer. 3. Configure session persistence to ensure that user sessions are processed on the same node through cookies, HTTP headers, etc., to avoid user experience degradation caused by frequent node switching. 4. Use the distribution strategy to distribute the requests to different nodes according to the performance indicators, visits, regions and other factors of the service nodes, so as to achieve the effect of load balancing. 5. Apply caching strategies, and set caching strategies for different nodes according to business scenarios to relieve server pressure and improve system performance. 6. Configure the firewall function to restrict and prevent illegal access to ensure system security and stability. 7. Regularly monitor the performance of the load balancer, optimize and adjust according to the monitoring data, and ensure the performance and availability of the load balancer.
