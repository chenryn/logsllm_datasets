off by some distance to the actual author location. Second, the dis-
tance ﬁeld returned by the nearby function is a coarse-grained in-
teger value (in miles). This was a recent change made by Whisper
in February 2014, before which the nearby function returned dis-
tances with decimal values. Third, Whisper server adds a random
error to the answer to each query, i.e. when we query the nearby
list repetitively from the same location, each query returns a dif-
ferent distance for the same whisper. The speciﬁc error function is
unknown.
Attack Details.
To accurately pinpoint a user location, our
approach is to extensively measure the “distance” from different
vantage points, and use large-scale statistics to infer user’s loca-
tion. Speciﬁcally, our attack exploits a key property of Whisper:
servers allow anyone to query the nearby list with arbitrarily self-
reported GPS values as input, and impose no rate limits on such
queries. This effectively helps us to overcome the limitations (i.e.
random error, coarse granularity) on the returned distance. First,
we can reduce or eliminate per-query noise by taking the average
distance across numerous queries from the same observation loca-
tion. Second, even though the absolute distance is still not accurate,
we can estimate the direction to the victim based on the measure-
ments from different locations. Then with distance and direction,
an attacker can repeat the measurement from a location closer to
the victim, thus iteratively deducing the victim’s real location.
We use a simple example to illustrate how this works. Suppose
user A (attacker) ﬁnds user B (victim)’s whisper in the nearby list,
and A wants to pinpoint B’s location:
1. A queries the nearby list to get its current distance (d) to
victim B (averaged across multiple queries).
2. To estimate the direction, A needs additional observation
points. We pick 8 points {A1, A2, ...A8} evenly distributed
on a circle centered at A with radius d (Figure 24). From
each point, A queries the nearby list to measure its distance
to victim {d1, d2, ..., d8}. Suppose X is a dot on the circle,
then objective function Obj =
reaches
the minimum if
−−→
AX is the right direction to the victim.

3. Then the attacker moves to the next location using
−−→
AX and
d, and repeats step 1 and 2. The algorithm terminates if d <
T hre1, or the distance d from two consecutive rounds differs
< T hre2.
In practice, the attacker can script all queries with forged GPS val-
ues and does not need to physically move.
Distance Error Correction.
Finally, we introduce a ﬁnal step
that uses physical measurements to calibrate and add an additional
“correction” factor to location data.
We ﬁrst post a target whisper at a predeﬁned physical location
L (on UCSB campus). Then we measure distances to L using
the nearby list from a set of observation points, each with known
ground-truth distances to L. The ground-truth distance ranges cover
from 1 to 25 miles (in 5 mile increments) and again from 0.1 to 0.9
miles (in 0.1-mile increments). At each increment, we use 8 obser-
vation points (as speciﬁed above) and use each to query the nearby
list 100 times. Figure 25 and Figure 26 plot the ground-truth dis-
tance versus the measured distance (for 25, 50 and 100 requests per
location). For distances greater than 1 mile, we ﬁnd that our es-
timates underestimate true physical distance to the victim. Within
1 mile, it clearly overestimates. This mapping between true and
measured distance serves as a guide for generating our “correction
factor,” which is applied to the ﬁnal estimate.
7.2 Experimental Validation of the Attack
A Single-target Experiment.
We ﬁrst post a whisper at a
pre-deﬁned location on UCSB campus as the target (victim). Then
we run the attack algorithm starting from distances of 1, 5, 10 and
20 miles away from the victim. Our algorithm takes the average
distance over 50 queries per location, and terminates when the esti-
mated distance from consecutive rounds differ < 0.1 mile or when
estimated distance < 0.5 mile (based on Figure 26). We repeat each
experiment 10 times and test the performance with and without our
distance error correction factor. Results are shown in Figure 27
and Figure 28.
147We make two key observations. First, the algorithm is very accu-
rate. The ﬁnal error distance, i.e. distance from the estimated vic-
tim location to the ground-truth location, is only 0.1 to 0.2 miles.
With a radius of 0.2 miles, attackers can already effectively iden-
tify user’s signiﬁcant points of interest (e.g., home, work, shop-
ping mall) and reconstruct a victim’s daily routine using mobility
traces [3]. Second, the results show that distance error correction
improves algorithm accuracy signiﬁcantly and reduces the number
of iterations needed to determine the victim’s location.
Geographically Diverse Targets.
To make sure our results
are not biased and speciﬁc to a single location, we apply the cor-
rection factor computed from local measurements (Figure 25 and
Figure 26) to carry out attacks in different cities. More speciﬁcally,
we post target whispers in Santa Barbara and Seattle Washington,
Denver Colorado, New York City, New York and Edinburgh Scot-
land. All whispers are posted via an Android phone with forged
GPS coordinates. Then we run the algorithm with distance error
correction. We ﬁnd the ﬁnal error distances are consistently less
than 0.2 miles, and that our correction factor can be generalized to
improve estimation accuracy regardless of geographic region.
7.3 Countermeasures
This type of statistical attack cannot be mitigated simply by
adding more noise into the system. Attackers can always apply
increasingly sophisticated statistical and data mining tools to elimi-
nate noise and determine the true location of a whisper. Instead, the
key is to restrict user access to extensive distance measurements.
This means putting more constraints (e.g., rate limits) on queries to
the nearby list. For instance, one approach is to enforce per-device
rate limits. Another is detect fake GPS values, either by relying on
client hardware (difﬁcult) or by detecting “unrealistic” movement
patterns by potential attackers. Finally, the ultimate defense is to
simply remove the “distance” ﬁeld altogether. While the Whisper
engineering team has already addressed this issue, we are not aware
of the speciﬁc steps they took to do so.
8. RELATED WORK
Online Social Networks.
Over the last few years, researchers
have performed measurement studies on online social networks
(OSNs) including Facebook [36,39], Twitter [8,25], Pinterest [12],
and Tumblr [9]. Today’s OSNs have stored large volumes of sensi-
tive data about users (e.g., personal proﬁle, friending information,
activity traces), all of which pose potential privacy risks. Various
techniques have been proposed to compromise user anonymity and
infer users’ sensitive information from social network data [5, 26,
27, 44]. Our study focuses on anonymous social networks, which
prioritize user privacy at the cost of eliminating persistent identities
as well as social links.
Anonymous Online Communities.
Anonymous online ser-
vices allow users to post content and communicate without reveal-
ing their real identity. Researchers have studied various anonymous
platforms including anonymous forums [32], discussion boards [6,
23] and Q&A sites [21]. Most earlier works study user commu-
nities focusing on content and sentiment analysis. More recently,
anonymous social networks have emerged, particularly on mobile
platforms. A recent work [31] conducted a user survey on SnapChat
to understand how they used the anonymous social app. In compar-
ison, our study is the ﬁrst to quantitively study user interaction, user
engagement, and security implications in the anonymous Whisper
network.
Device Localization.
Our attack algorithm to localize Whisper
users is inspired by existing techniques used for device localization
in wireless (mobile) networks [15, 20, 43]. We differ from existing
techniques in our approach to deal with the random errors injected
by Whisper server. Also, our contribution is more on identifying
and validating the security vulnerability instead of the localization
algorithm itself.
9. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Anonymous, mobile-only messaging apps such as Whisper mark
a clear shift away from traditional social networks and towards
privacy-conscious communication tools. To the best of our knowl-
edge, our study is the ﬁrst large data-driven study of social inter-
actions, user engagement, content moderation and privacy risks on
the Whisper network. We show that without strong user identities
or persistent social links, users interact with random strangers in-
stead of a deﬁned set of friends, leading to weak ties and challenges
in long-term user engagement. We show that even in anonymous
messaging apps, signiﬁcant attacks against user privacy are very
feasible. We believe that this shift towards privacy in communica-
tion tools is here to stay, and insights from our study on Whisper
provides value for developers working on next generation systems
in this space.
Whisper is not only a social communication tool, but also a net-
work for sharing anonymous content. Analysis and modeling of
topics and sentiments in Whisper would be interesting topics for
future work. For example, whether and how do users establish
communities around “topics” or “themes”? How can anonymous
posts and conversations impact user sentiment and emotions? How
does user behavior on Whisper compare to those of existing content
networks such as Digg and Quora?
