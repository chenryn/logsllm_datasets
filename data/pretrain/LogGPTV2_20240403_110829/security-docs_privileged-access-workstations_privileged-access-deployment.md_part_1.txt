# Privileged access deployment
This document will guide you through implementing the technical components of the [privileged access strategy](), including secure accounts, workstations and devices, and interface security (with conditional access policy).
![Summary of security level profiles](./media/privileged-access-deployment/privileged-access-deployment-profile-summary.png)
This guidance sets up all of the profiles for all three security levels and should be assigned your organizations roles based on the [Privileged access security levels](privileged-access-security-levels.md) guidance. Microsoft recommends configuring them in the order described in the [rapid modernization plan (RAMP)](security-rapid-modernization-plan.md)
## License requirements
The concepts covered in this guide assume you have Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 or an equivalent SKU. Some of the recommendations in this guide can be implemented with lower SKUs. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Enterprise licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/microsoft-365-enterprise).
To automate license provisioning, consider [group-based licensing](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-groups-assign) for your users.
## Microsoft Entra configuration
Microsoft Entra ID manages users, groups, and devices for your administrator workstations. Enable identity services and features with an [administrator account](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).
When you create the secured workstation administrator account, you expose the account to your current workstation. Make sure you use a known safe device to do this initial configuration and all global configuration. To reduce the attack exposure for the first-time experience, consider following the [guidance to prevent malware infections](/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/prevent-malware-infection).
Require multi-factor authentication, at least for your administrators. See [Conditional Access: Require MFA for administrators](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/howto-conditional-access-policy-admin-mfa) for implementation guidance.
### Microsoft Entra users and groups
1. From the Azure portal, browse to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Users** > **New user**.
1. Create your device user by following the steps in the [create user tutorial](/Intune/quickstart-create-user).
1. Enter:
   * **Name** - Secure Workstation Administrator
   * **User name** - `PI:EMAIL`
   * **Directory role** - **Limited administrator** and select the **Intune Administrator** role.
   * **Usage Location** - For example **United Kingdom**, or your desired location form the list.
1. Select **Create**.
Create your device administrator user.
1. Enter:
   * **Name** - Secure Workstation Administrator
   * **User name** - `PI:EMAIL`
   * **Directory role** - **Limited administrator** and select the **Intune Administrator** role.
   * **Usage Location** - For example **United Kingdom**, or your desired location form the list.
1. Select **Create**.
Next, you create four groups: **Secure Workstation Users**, **Secure Workstation Admins**, **Emergency BreakGlass** and **Secure Workstation Devices**.
From the Azure portal, browse to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Groups** > **New group**.
1. For the workstation users group, you might want to configure [group-based licensing](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/licensing-groups-assign) to automate provisioning of licenses to users.
1. For the workstation users group, enter:
   * **Group type** - Security
   * **Group name** - Secure Workstation Users
   * **Membership type** - Assigned
1. Add your secure workstation user: `PI:EMAIL`
1. You can add any other users that will be using secure workstations.
1. Select **Create**.
1. For the Privileged Workstation Admins group, enter:
   * **Group type** - Security
   * **Group name** - Secure Workstation Admins
   * **Membership type** - Assigned
1. Add your secure workstation user: `PI:EMAIL`
1. You can add any other users that will be managing secure workstations.  
1. Select **Create**.
1. For the Emergency BreakGlass group, enter:
   * **Group type** - Security
   * **Group name** - Emergency BreakGlass
   * **Membership type** - Assigned
1. Select **Create**.
1. Add Emergency Access accounts to this group.
1. For the workstation devices group, enter:
   * **Group type** - Security
   * **Group name** - Secure Workstations
   * **Membership type** - Dynamic Device
   * **Dynamic Membership rules** - `(device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ -contains "[OrderID]:PAW")`
1. Select **Create**.
### Microsoft Entra device configuration
#### Specify who can join devices to Microsoft Entra ID
Configure your devices setting in Active Directory to allow your administrative security group to join devices to your domain. To configure this setting from the Azure portal:
1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Devices** > **Device settings**.
1. Choose **Selected** under **Users may join devices to Microsoft Entra ID**, and then select the "Secure Workstation Users" group.
#### Remove local admin rights
This method requires that users of the VIP, DevOps, and Privileged workstations have no administrator rights on their machines. To configure this setting from the Azure portal:
1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Devices** > **Device settings**.
1. Select **None** under **Additional local administrators on Microsoft Entra joined devices**.
Refer to [How to manage the local administrators group on Microsoft Entra joined devices](/azure/active-directory/devices/assign-local-admin) for details on how to manage members of the local administrators group.
#### Require multi-factor authentication to join devices
To further strengthen the process of joining devices to Microsoft Entra ID:
1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Devices** > **Device settings**.
1. Select **Yes** under **Require Multi-Factor Auth to join devices**.
1. Select **Save**.
#### Configure mobile device management
From the Azure portal:
1. Browse to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **Mobility (MDM and MAM)** > **Microsoft Intune**.
1. Change the **MDM user scope** setting to **All**.
1. Select **Save**.
These steps allow you to manage any device with Microsoft Endpoint Manager. For more information, see [Intune Quickstart: Set up automatic enrollment for Windows 10 devices](/Intune/quickstart-setup-auto-enrollment). You create Intune configuration and compliance policies in a future step.
### Microsoft Entra Conditional Access
Microsoft Entra Conditional Access can help restrict privileged administrative tasks to compliant devices. Predefined members of the **Secure Workstation Users** group are required to perform multi-factor authentication when signing in to cloud applications. A best practice is to exclude emergency access accounts from the policy. For more information, see [Manage emergency access accounts in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access).
#### Conditional Access only allowing secured workstation ability to access Azure portal
Organizations should block Privileged Users from being able to connect to cloud management interfaces, portals and PowerShell, from non-PAW devices.
To block unauthorized devices from being able to access cloud management interfaces, follow the guidance in the article [Conditional Access: Filters for Devices (preview)](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/concept-condition-filters-for-devices#create-a-conditional-access-policy).  It's essential that while deploying this feature you consider, [emergency access account](/azure/active-directory/roles/security-emergency-access) functionality. These accounts should be used only for extreme cases and the account managed through policy.
 > [!NOTE]
 > You will need to create a user group, and include your emergency user that can bypass the Conditional Access policy. For our example we have a security group called **Emergency BreakGlass**
This policy set will ensure that your Administrators must use a device that is able to present a specific device attribute value, that MFA is satisfied, and the device is marked as compliant by Microsoft Endpoint Manager and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
Organizations should also consider blocking legacy authentication protocols in their environments. There are multiple ways to accomplish this task, for more information about blocking legacy authentication protocols, see the article, [How to: Block legacy authentication to Microsoft Entra ID with Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication).
## Microsoft Intune configuration
### Device enrollment deny BYOD
In our sample, we recommend that BYOD devices not be permitted. Using [Intune BYOD enrollment](/mem/intune/enrollment/windows-enrollment-methods) allows users to enroll devices that are less, or not trusted. However it's important to note that in organizations that have a limited budget to purchase new devices, looking to use existing hardware fleet, or considering non-windows devices, might consider the BYOD capability in Intune to deploy the Enterprise profile.
The following guidance will configure Enrollment for deployments that will deny BYOD access.
### Set enrollment restrictions preventing BYOD
1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose > **Devices** > **Enrollment restrictions** > choose the default restriction **All Users**  
1. Select **Properties** > Platform settings **Edit**
1. Select **Block** for All types, except Windows MDM.
1. Select **Block** for all Personally owned items.
### Create an Autopilot deployment profile
After creating a device group, you must create a deployment profile to configure the Autopilot devices.
1. In the [Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), choose **Device enrollment** > **Windows enrollment** > **Deployment Profiles** > **Create Profile**.
1. Enter:
   * Name - **Secure workstation deployment profile**.
