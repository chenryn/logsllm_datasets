Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.
Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.
Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.
Create network segmentation
5.
Log traﬃc between network segments
6.
Incorporate threat intelligence
7.
Perform routine inspections of asset backups
8.
Conduct user security awareness training
9.
Conduct response training (this PBC)
10. Use the ﬁrewall to restrict ﬁle sharing communication, such as SMB[2]
11.
Implement network intrusion detection/prevention systems (NIDS/NIPS) to look for
known adversary tools and malware[3]                 | 1.
Monitor for:
a.
Commands related to remote ﬁle transfer[4]
b.
Newly constructed ﬁles related to tool transfer, especially those that are
duplicated across multiple hosts[5]
c.
Contextual data related to named pipes[6]
d.
Unexpected network share access[7]
e.
Internal network connections that create ﬁles on-system, especially
traﬃc originating from unknown/unexpected sources[8]
f.
Newly constructed processes that assist with lateral tool transfer[9]
2.
Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.
Routinely check ﬁrewall,
IDS,
IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity                   | 1.
Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.
Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.
Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.
Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.
Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.
Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.
Fortify non-impacted critical assets
8.
Use signature detection to quarantine oﬀending processes[3]                           |  |  |
| 2 | (E) Eradication | (R) Recovery      | (L) Lessons/Opportunities |  |  |
| 3 | 1.
Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.
Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.
Reset any compromised passwords
4.
Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle
5.
Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack proﬁle PRIOR to system recovery
6.
Patch asset vulnerabilities                 | 1.
Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time
Objective)
2.
Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.
Resolve any related security incidents
4.
Restore aﬀected systems to their last clean backup                   | 1.
Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.
Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.
Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.
Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.
Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a
chain of behavior that could lead to other activities                           |  |  |
