I have reviewed the existing issues in this repository and believe that my issue is not a duplicate. When I use the `ListItem` component with the `rootRef` prop, I receive the following warning message in the Chrome console:

> Warning: React does not recognize the `rootRef` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `rootref` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

I need to use `rootRef` because I want to display a popover, and the `ListItem` should serve as the anchor element.

Here are the versions of the relevant packages and browser:
- `material-ui`: 1.0.0-beta.23
- `react`: 16.2.0
- Chrome: Version 62.0.3202.94

Thank you for your assistance.
