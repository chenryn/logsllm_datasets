When I use ListItem with rootRef I get a Warning-Message in console in Chrome:
Warning: React does not recognize the `rootRef` prop on a DOM element. If you
intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as
lowercase `rootref` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent
component, remove it from the DOM element.
(i need rootRef because i want to show a popover on the listItem, and the
listItem should be the anchorElement)
