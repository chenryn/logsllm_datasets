Abstract
DDoS defense today relies on expensive and propri-
etary hardware appliances deployed at ﬁxed locations.
This introduces key limitations with respect to ﬂexibil-
ity (e.g., complex routing to get trafﬁc to these “choke-
points”) and elasticity in handling changing attack pat-
terns. We observe an opportunity to address these limita-
tions using new networking paradigms such as software-
deﬁned networking (SDN) and network functions virtu-
alization (NFV). Based on this observation, we design
and implement Bohatei, a ﬂexible and elastic DDoS de-
fense system.
In designing Bohatei, we address key
challenges with respect to scalability, responsiveness,
and adversary-resilience. We have implemented de-
fenses for several DDoS attacks using Bohatei. Our
evaluations show that Bohatei is scalable (handling 500
Gbps attacks), responsive (mitigating attacks within one
minute), and resilient to dynamic adversaries.

In spite of extensive industrial and academic efforts
(e.g., [3, 41, 42]), distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)
attacks continue to plague the Internet. Over the last
few years, we have observed a dramatic escalation
in the number, scale, and diversity of DDoS attacks.
For instance, recent estimates suggest that over 20,000
DDoS attacks occur per day [44], with peak volumes
of 0.5 Tbps [14, 30]. At the same time, new vec-
tors [37, 55] and variations of known attacks [49] are
constantly emerging. The damage that these DDoS at-
tacks cause to organizations is well-known and include
both monetary losses (e.g., $40,000 per hour [12]) and
loss of customer trust.
Introduction
DDoS defense today is implemented using expensive
and proprietary hardware appliances (deployed in-house
or in the cloud [8, 19]) that are ﬁxed in terms of place-
ment, functionality, and capacity. First, they are typi-
cally deployed at ﬁxed network aggregation points (e.g.,
a peering edge link of an ISP). Second, they provide
ﬁxed functionality with respect to the types of DDoS at-
tacks they can handle. Third, they have a ﬁxed capacity
with respect to the maximum volume of trafﬁc they can
process. This ﬁxed nature of today’s approach leaves
network operators with two unpleasant options: (1) to
overprovision by deploying defense appliances that can
handle a high (but pre-deﬁned) volume of every known
attack type at each of the aggregation points, or (2) to
deploy a smaller number of defense appliances at a cen-
tral location (e.g., a scrubbing center) and reroute traf-
ﬁc to this location. While option (2) might be more
cost-effective, it raises two other challenges. First, op-
erators run the risk of underprovisioning. Second, traf-
ﬁc needs to be explicitly routed through a ﬁxed central
location, which introduces additional trafﬁc latency and
requires complex routing hacks (e.g., [57]). Either way,
handling larger volumes or new types of attacks typically
mandates purchasing and deploying new hardware appli-
ances.
Ideally, a DDoS defense architecture should provide
the ﬂexibility to seamlessly place defense mechanisms
where they are needed and the elasticity to launch de-
fenses as needed depending on the type and scale of the
attack. We observe that similar problems in other ar-
eas of network management have been tackled by tak-
ing advantage of two new paradigms: software-deﬁned
networking (SDN) [32, 40] and network functions vir-
tualization (NFV) [43]. SDN simpliﬁes routing by de-
coupling the control plane (i.e., routing policy) from the
data plane (i.e., switches). In parallel, the use of virtual-
ized network functions via NFV reduces cost and enables
elastic scaling and reduced time-to-deploy akin to cloud
computing [43]. These potential beneﬁts have led major
industry players (e.g., Verizon, AT&T) to embrace SDN
and NFV [4, 6, 15, 23].1
In this paper, we present Bohatei2, a ﬂexible and

elastic DDoS defense system that demonstrates the ben-
eﬁts of these new network management paradigms in the
context of DDoS defense. Bohatei leverages NFV ca-
pabilities to elastically vary the required scale (e.g., 10
Gbps vs. 100 Gbps attacks) and type (e.g., SYN proxy
vs. DNS reﬂector defense) of DDoS defense realized by
defense virtual machines (VMs). Using the ﬂexibility
of SDN, Bohatei steers suspicious trafﬁc through the de-
fense VMs while minimizing user-perceived latency and
network congestion.
In designing Bohatei, we address three key algorith-
mic and system design challenges. First, the resource
management problem to determine the number and loca-
tion of defense VMs is NP-hard and takes hours to solve.
Second, existing SDN solutions are fundamentally un-
suitable for DDoS defense (and even introduce new at-
tack avenues) because they rely on a per-ﬂow orchestra-
tion paradigm, where switches need to contact a network
controller each time they receive a new ﬂow. Finally,
an intelligent DDoS adversary can attempt to evade an
elastic defense, or alternatively induce provisioning inef-
ﬁciencies by dynamically changing attack patterns.
In summary, this paper
We have implemented a Bohatei controller using
OpenDaylight [17], an industry-grade SDN platform.
We have used a combination of open source tools (e.g.,
OpenvSwitch [16], Snort [48], Bro [46], iptables [13]) as
defense modules. We have developed a scalable resource
management algorithm. Our evaluation, performed on a
real testbed as well as using simulations, shows that Bo-
hatei effectively defends against several different DDoS
attack types, scales to scenarios involving 500 Gbps at-
tacks and ISPs with about 200 backbone routers, and can
effectively cope with dynamic adversaries.

2 Background and Motivation
In this section, we give a brief overview of software-
deﬁned networking (SDN) and network functions virtu-
alization (NFV) and discuss new opportunities these can
enable in the context of DDoS defense.
2.1 New network management trends
Software-deﬁned networking (SDN): Traditionally,
network control tasks (e.g., routing, trafﬁc engineering,
and access control) have been tightly coupled with their
data plane implementations (e.g., distributed routing pro-
tocols, ad hoc ACLs). This practice has made net-
work management complex, brittle, and error-prone [32].
SDN simpliﬁes network management by decoupling the
network control plane (e.g., an intended routing policy)
from the network data plane (e.g., packet forwarding
by individual switches). Using SDN, a network opera-
tor can centrally program the network behavior through
APIs such as OpenFlow [40]. This ﬂexibility has mo-
tivated several real world deployments to transition to
SDN-based architectures (e.g., [34]).
Network functions virtualization (NFV): Today, net-
work functions (e.g., ﬁrewalls, IDSes) are implemented
using specialized hardware. While this practice was nec-
essary for performance reasons, it leads to high cost and
inﬂexibility. These limitations have motivated the use
of virtual network functions (e.g., a virtual ﬁrewall) on
general-purpose servers [43]. Similar to traditional vir-
tualization, NFV reduces costs and enables new opportu-
nities (e.g., elastic scaling). Indeed, leading vendors al-
ready offer virtual appliance products (e.g., [24]). Given
these beneﬁts, major ISPs have deployed (or are planning
to deploy) datacenters to run virtualized functions that re-
place existing specialized hardware [6, 15, 23]. One po-
tential concern with NFV is low packet processing per-
formance. Fortunately, several recent advances enable
line-rate (e.g., 10-40Gbps) packet processing by soft-
ware running on commodity hardware [47]. Thus, such
performance concerns are increasingly a non-issue and
will further diminish given constantly improving hard-
ware support [18].
2.2 New opportunities in DDoS defense
Next, we brieﬂy highlight new opportunities that SDN
and NFV can enable for DDoS defense.
Lower capital costs: Current DDoS defense is based
on specialized hardware appliances (e.g., [3, 20]). Net-
work operators either deploy them on-premises, or out-
source DDoS defense to a remote packet scrubbing site
(e.g., [8]).
In either case, DDoS defense is expensive.

For instance, based on public estimates from the Gen-
eral Services Administration (GSA) Schedule, a 10 Gbps
DDoS defense appliance costs ≈$128,000 [11]. To put
this in context, a commodity server with a 10 Gbps Net-
work Interface Card (NIC) costs about $3,000 [10]. This
suggests roughly 1-2 orders of magnitude potential re-
duction in capital expenses (ignoring software and de-
velopment costs) by moving from specialized appliances
to commodity hardware.3
Time to market: As new and larger attacks emerge,
enterprises today need to frequently purchase more ca-
pable hardware appliances and integrate them into the
network infrastructure. This is an expensive and tedious
process [43]. In contrast, launching a VM customized for
a new type of attack, or launching more VMs to handle
larger-scale attacks, is trivial using SDN and NFV.
Elasticity with respect to attack volume:
Today,
DDoS defense appliances deployed at network choke-
points need to be provisioned to handle a predeﬁned
maximum attack volume. As an illustrative example,
consider an enterprise network where a DDoS scrubber
appliance is deployed at each ingress point. Suppose the
projected resource footprint (i.e., defense resource us-
age over time) to defend against a SYN ﬂood attack at
times t1, t2, and t3 is 40, 80, and 10 Gbps, respectively.4
The total resource footprint over this entire time period
is 3× max{40,80,10} = 240 Gbps, as we need to provi-
sion for the worst case. However, if we could elastically
scale the defense capacity, we would only introduce a re-
source footprint of 40 + 80 + 10 = 130 Gbps—a 45% re-
duction in defense resource footprint. This reduced hard-
ware footprint can yield energy savings and allow ISPs to
repurpose the hardware for other services.
Flexibility with respect to attack types: Building on
the above example, suppose in addition to the SYN ﬂood
attack, the projected resource footprint for a DNS ampli-
ﬁcation attack in time intervals t1, t2, and t3 is 20, 40,
and 80 Gbps, respectively. Launching only the required
types of defense VMs as opposed to using monolithic
appliances (which handle both attacks), drops the hard-
ware footprint by 40%; i.e., from 3× (max{40,80,10} +
max{20,40,80}) =480 to 270.
Flexibility with respect to vendors: Today, network
operators are locked-in to the defense capabilities offered
by speciﬁc vendors.
In contrast, with SDN and NFV,
they can launch appropriate best-of-breed defenses. For
example, suppose vendor 1 is better for SYN ﬂood de-
fense, but vendor 2 is better for DNS ﬂood defense. The
physical constraints today may force an ISP to pick only
3Operational expenses are harder to compare due to the lack of pub-
licly available data.
4For brevity, we use the trafﬁc volume as a proxy for the memory
consumption and CPU cycles required to handle the trafﬁc.

one hardware appliance. With SDN/NFV we can avoid
the undesirable situation of picking only one vendor and
rather have a deployment with both types of VMs each
for a certain type of attack. Looking even further, we
also envision that network operators can mix and match
capabilities from different vendors; e.g., if vendor 1 has
better detection capabilities but vendor 2’s blocking al-
gorithm is more effective, then we can ﬂexibly combine
these two to create a more powerful defense platform.
Simpliﬁed and efﬁcient routing: Network operators
today need to employ complex routing hacks (e.g., [57])
to steer trafﬁc through a ﬁxed-location DDoS hardware
appliance (deployed either on-premises or in a remote
site). As Figure 1 illustrates, this causes additional la-
tency. Consider two end-to-end ﬂows f low1 and f low2.
Way-pointing f low2 through the appliance (the left hand
side of the ﬁgure) makes the total path lengths 3 hops.
But if we could launch VMs where they are needed (the
right hand side of the ﬁgure), we could drop the total
path lengths to 2 hops—a 33% decrease in trafﬁc foot-
print. Using NFV we can launch defense VMs on the
closest location to where they are currently needed, and
using SDN we can ﬂexibly route trafﬁc through them.
In summary, we observe new opportunities to build a
