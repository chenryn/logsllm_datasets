# Environment
    Windows build number: [Version 10.0.18362.657]
    PowerToys version: 0.18.0
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce
Three monitor setup, from Left to Right:
  * Monitor 1: Browser with active Project + Team Explorer/Output/etc
  * Monitor 2: Main Visual window (code)
  * Monitor 3: Solution Explorer + Additional Apps (ie: chrome debugger usually)
# Expected behavior
Remember each of Visual Studio's individual windows last zone.
# Actual behavior
All VS windows get moved into the last zone I dropped in  
(My guess is because they all end up using the same title or inherit the
parent window handle??)  
Note that VS remembers the last setup correctly if I have "Last known zone"
turned off.
