Applies to: Windows Server 2022, Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012
Sets or displays the file transfer type. The ftp command supports both ASCII (default) and binary image file transfer types:
We recommend using ASCII when transferring text files. In ASCII mode, character conversions to and from the network standard character set are performed. For example, end-of-line characters are converted as necessary, based on the target operating system.
We recommend using binary when transferring executable files. In binary mode, files are transferred in one-byte units.
