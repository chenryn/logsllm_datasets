The `type` command in FTP is used to set or display the file transfer type. FTP supports two types of file transfers: ASCII (default) and binary.

- **ASCII Mode:** 
  - Recommended for transferring text files.
  - In this mode, character conversions are performed to and from the network standard character set. For example, end-of-line characters are converted as necessary based on the target operating system.

- **Binary Mode:**
  - Recommended for transferring executable files or any non-text files.
  - In this mode, files are transferred in one-byte units without any character conversion.

#### Syntax
```plaintext
type [type]
```

#### Parameters
- **[type]**: Specifies the file transfer type. If this parameter is omitted, the current transfer type is displayed.

#### Examples
- To set the file transfer type to ASCII:
  ```plaintext
  type ascii
  ```

- To set the file transfer type to binary:
  ```plaintext
  type binary
  ```

This command allows you to ensure that your files are transferred correctly, maintaining their integrity and format.
