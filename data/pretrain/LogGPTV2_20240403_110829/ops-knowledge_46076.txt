User: In cloud architecture, automation and configuration management are very important. Please provide an automated configuration solution based on Ansible.
Assistant: The Ansible-based automatic configuration scheme is as follows: 1. Install Ansible First, you need to install Ansible on the target node. 2. Write Ansible Playbook Write Ansible Playbook, which contains all components and tasks that need to be deployed and configured, including installing and configuring software packages, creating users and setting permissions, etc. 3. Configure the host list Configure the target node list in the Ansible host so that Ansible can identify the nodes to execute the task on. 4. Execute Ansible Playbook Run Ansible Playbook, Ansible will automatically connect to the target node and execute the specified task. During execution, Ansible sends notifications and alerts based on task status, helping you keep your systems up to date. By using Ansible, entire application stacks can be easily deployed and configured for automation and configuration management. This ensures system consistency and repeatability, and can greatly reduce errors and safety issues caused by manual configuration.
