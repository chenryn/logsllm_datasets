**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):

**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** :
  * GKE

**What happened** :  
When using "source" as volume name in a pod or deployment spec, it fails with
the "spec.template.spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found:
"source"".
**What you expected to happen** :  
kubectl apply -f should not have thrown an error, but deployed the latest
volume.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):
  * Create a pod with at least 2 containers (including init containers)
  * use an emptyDir volume named "source"
  * create this pod or deployment
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
When adding a second volume definition with the same name it works.
Does not work:
          - name: source
            emptyDir: {}
Does work:
          - name: source
            emptyDir: {}
          - name: source
            emptyDir: {}
Does also work:
          - name: source2
            emptyDir: {}
As a sidenote. Applying the duplicate volumes works and getting the yaml from
the apiserver actually only returns one volume.
