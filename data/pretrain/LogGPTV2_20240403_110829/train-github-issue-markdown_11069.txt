Circular dependencies are a huge issue when working with third party tooling
(graphing dependencies, integrating into other build systems etc).
I think the correct solution here would be to put @types/react in the
bundleDependencies
(https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bundleddependencies) attribute in
package.json to make the circular dependency invisible to consumers of this
package.
  * I tried using the `@types/xxxx` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
  * Mention the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.
