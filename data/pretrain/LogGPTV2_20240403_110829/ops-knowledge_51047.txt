User: I created a docker image with python libraries and Jupyter. 
I start the container with the option -p 8888:8888, to link ports between host and container. 
When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container, it is running on localhost:8888 (and does not find a browser). I used the command jupyter notebook
But from my host, what is the IP address I have to use to work with Jupyter in host's browser ? 
With the command ifconfig, I find eth0, docker, wlan0, lo ...
Thanks !
Assistant: To get the link to your Jupyter notebook server:
After your docker run command, a hyperlink should be automatically generated. It looks something like this: http://localhost:8888/?token=f3a8354eb82c92f5a12399fe1835bf8f31275f917928c8d2 :: /home/jovyan/work
If you want to get the link again later down the line, you can type docker exec -it <docker_container_name> jupyter notebook list.
