I have created a Docker image that includes Python libraries and Jupyter. To start the container, I use the `-p 8888:8888` option to map port 8888 between the host and the container.

When I launch a Jupyter kernel inside the container using the `jupyter notebook` command, it runs on `localhost:8888` within the container. However, this does not automatically open a browser on the host machine.

To access the Jupyter notebook from my host machine's browser, I need to determine the correct IP address to use. When I run the `ifconfig` command on the host, I see several network interfaces, including `eth0`, `docker0`, `wlan0`, and `lo`.

**How can I determine the correct IP address to use in my host's browser to connect to the Jupyter notebook running in the Docker container?**

### Solution

To access the Jupyter notebook server from your host machine's browser, follow these steps:

1. **Automatic Link Generation:**
   - After starting the Docker container with the `docker run` command, a hyperlink should be automatically generated. It typically looks like this:
     ```
     http://localhost:8888/?token=f3a8354eb82c92f5a12399fe1835bf8f31275f917928c8d2 :: /home/jovyan/work
     ```
   - You can use this link directly in your host's browser to access the Jupyter notebook.

2. **Manual Link Retrieval:**
   - If you need to retrieve the link at a later time, you can use the following command to list the running Jupyter notebooks inside the container:
     ```sh
     docker exec -it <docker_container_name> jupyter notebook list
     ```
   - Replace `<docker_container_name>` with the actual name or ID of your Docker container.

3. **Determine the Correct IP Address:**
   - The IP address you need to use is typically the IP address of the host machine itself. You can find this by checking the `ifconfig` output for the appropriate network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).
   - For example, if the IP address of `eth0` is `192.168.1.100`, you would use:
     ```
     http://192.168.1.100:8888
     ```
