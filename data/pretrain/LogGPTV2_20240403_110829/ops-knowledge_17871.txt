User: Which linux distro is better suited for Python web development?
Background:
I currently develop on Windows and it's fine, but I am looking to move my core Python development to Linux. I'm sure most any distro will work fine, but does anyone have any reasons to believe one distro is better than another?
Assistant: Any desktop distribution like Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Fedora, ... is OK, But if you want to always have the latest versions, I recommend ArchLinux.
