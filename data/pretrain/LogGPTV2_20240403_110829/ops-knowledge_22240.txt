User: Using Python 2.7 installed via homebrew. I then used pip to install IPython. So, IPython seems to be installed under: 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ 
I think this is true because there is a IPython directory and ipython egg. 
However, when I type ipython in the terminal I get: 
-bash: ipython: command not found
I do not understand why this ONLY happens with IPython and not with python? Also, how do I fix this? What path should I add in .bashrc? And how should I add? 
Currently, my .bashrc reads: 
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/
Thanks!
Assistant: After trying to a number of solutions like above with out joy, when I restarted my terminal, Ipython command launched. Don't forgot to restart your terminal after all the fiddling!
P.S. I think the brew install Ipython did it ... but can't be sure.
