# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Please change the powertoys icon to something that uses a single color. Most
applications follow this rule which makes is easy to organize their icons in
the tray in a way that lets you quickly find the icon, but a multicolor icon
like the current one doesn't fit anywhere. Alternatively, just make it a white
outline icon without any color, like most other win10 icons, so it can be
grouped with those.
Small thing, surprisingly important to get right.
