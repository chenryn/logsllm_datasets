ABSTRACT
Online social networks, such as Twitter, have soared in pop-
ularity and in turn have become attractive targets of spam.
In fact, spammers have evolved their strategies to stay ahead
of Twitter’s anti-spam measures in this short period of time.
In this paper, we investigate the strategies Twitter spam-
mers employ to reach relevant target audiences. Due to
their targeted approaches to send spam, we see evidence of
a large number of the spam accounts forming relationships
with other Twitter users, thereby becoming deeply embed-
ded in the social network.
We analyze nearly 20 million tweets from about 7 million
Twitter accounts over a period of ﬁve days. We identify a
set of 14,230 spam accounts that manage to live longer than
the other 73% of other spam accounts in our data set. We
characterize their behavior, types of tweets they use, and
how they target their audience. We ﬁnd that though spam
campaigns changed little from a recent work by Thomas
et al., spammer strategies evolved much in the same short
time span, causing us to sometimes ﬁnd contradictory spam-
mer behavior from what was noted in Thomas et al.’s work.
Speciﬁcally, we identify four major strategies used by 2/3rd
of the spammers in our data. The most popular of these was
one where spammers targeted their own followers. The avail-
ability of various kinds of services that help garner followers
only increases the popularity of this strategy. The evolution
in spammer strategies we observed in our work suggests that
studies like ours should be undertaken frequently to keep up
with spammer evolution.

INTRODUCTION
Email spam has been a problem for decades. As email
spam ﬁltering programs have improved, with many claiming
99% or higher accuracies, spammers have looked for other
avenues. Online social networks (OSNs), such as Twitter,
are obvious new targets because of their sharp rise in popu-
larity. Twitter alone boasted 140 million users as of March
2012 [20]. Fighting spam on OSNs requires new types of
ﬁltering techniques, owing to the fundamental diﬀerences
between email and OSNs as communication media. As an
example, in the case of Twitter, the unit of communication,
tweet, is merely 140 characters, limiting the eﬃciency of tra-
ditional spam ﬁlters which rely on a certain size of text to
be eﬀective. Owing to the diﬀerences, both operators of
OSNs as well as the research community have recently been
actively pursuing the topic of spam on OSNs.
An over-arching theme across recent spam-related research
work on Twitter has been the characterization of spam ac-
tivity and building classiﬁers to aid in the identiﬁcation of
spammers and spam tweets. Our work complements exist-
ing research around this theme by examining an untouched
aspect of Twitter spam, which is that we do not know how
spammers pick their targets. Having this knowledge can
complement existing eﬀorts to defeat spam by protecting
the targets and also by identifying spammers. Interestingly,
this investigation is possible on OSNs because they are con-
tained ecosystems where both spammers and the targets be-
ing spammed reside as users within the same system. This
is in sharp contrast to traditional email spam where email
addresses sending and receiving spam belong to diﬀerent ad-
ministrative entities.
In our work, we examine over 80K spam accounts on
Twitter and investigate their targets. The strategies we bin
spammers under are motivated by a combination of the func-
tionality provided by popular softwares known to automate
spam on Twitter and a study of the behavior of worst of-
fenders. The key contributions of our work are along the
following two dimensions:
- Strategies for picking targets: We ﬁnd ﬁve key strate-
gies being used by Twitter spammers. We ﬁnd that
389
Twitter spammers overwhelmingly target their own
followers, who are expected to be voluntary subscribers
of spammers’ tweets. This ﬁnding is in sharp contrast
to the observation made by Thomas et al. [16] just
about a year ago where they found that spammers
often failed to garner followers. A plausible expla-
nation for the diﬀerence in observation is that spam-
mers have evolved to adapt around Twitter’s eﬀort to
ﬁght spam [19]. This view is supported by observa-
tions about the thriving underground economy around
buying Twitter followers [13], which makes it easy for
spammers to adapt in the manner we observed.
In terms of other strategies used to ﬁnd targets, we ﬁnd
that a relatively smaller number of spammers also tar-
get the followers of other popular accounts and even
search for targets whose tweets contain keywords of
interest to their spam campaigns. Finally, an even
smaller number of spammers hijack popular discussion
topics (referred to as trending topics, in Twitter par-
lance) to increase the possibility that their tweets are
found by a large number of users interested in follow-
ing those topics. The knowledge about these strategies
can be used to actively identify spammers and to pro-
tect their targets from being spammed.
- Observations about spammer behavior: During the
course of our work, we made multiple observations
about spammer behavior that can be used as features
to improve the performance of existing spam classi-
ﬁers for Twitter. First, almost 3/4th of the spammers
use a certain tweet type exclusively when only 13%
of good users on Twitter have this behavior. In fact,
2/3rd of the spammers target only their own follow-
ers through the spam tweets. In contrast, only 10% of
good Twitter users target only their own followers. We
also learnt that the method used for posting tweets can
also predict whether the tweet is spam or not, primar-
ily because spammers seem to prefer diﬀerent modes
of posting their tweets than other Twitter users.
The key motivation for our work was to complement ex-
isting spam defenses and we believe that the insights gained
can eﬀectively serve that purpose. Additionally, we were
able to draw comparisons with Thomas et al.’s work done
a year ago, where they examined the behavior of Twitter
spammers. The comparisons revealed that even though the
spam campaigns have remained the same, Twitter spammers
have evolved in their strategies in a mere one-year period in
an attempt to stay aﬂoat amidst Twitter’s anti-spam eﬀorts.
This observation suggests that strategies of spammers need
to be re-examined frequently in order to stay ahead of the
game.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
2, we discuss the methodology for our data collection and
how we diﬀerentiate successful from unsuccessful spammers
in our data set. Section 3 provides background information
about types of tweets on Twitter and discusses our observa-
tions on the types used by spam proﬁles. In Section 4, we
describe the major strategies we found which are used by
spammers to ﬁnd their target users. In Section 5, we provide
our observations regarding applications used by spammers.
Section 6 provides a discussion on some interesting observa-
tions in our data set. Sections 7 and 8 provide related work
and conclusions, respectively.
2. DATA COLLECTION AND OVERVIEW
We used Twitter’s streaming API to collect tweets for
November 1st, 2011. The API samples one in ten tweets
and makes them available to us. Our data set contained
19,991,050 tweets and 7,078,643 unique Twitter user account
proﬁles. Since we needed a set of spam proﬁles to test, we
used the output of Twitter’s suspension policy as ground
truth. To determine which accounts were suspended by
Twitter, we visited http://www.twitter.com/
for each username contained in the proﬁles in our data set
and looked for a string indicating suspension of the account.
This process yielded 82,274 suspended proﬁles. These pro-
ﬁles are similar in nature to those analyzed by Thomas et al.
in there recent work where they analyzed suspended Twit-
ter accounts. While we analyze this data for comparison and
to see how Twitter spammers have evolved in the last one
year since Thomas et al.’s work, we further applied a couple
of ﬁltering criteria in order to analyze spammer strategies.
First, we eliminated proﬁles that tweeted in languages other
than English since otherwise we would not be able to ana-
lyze their tweets against various spamming strategies. This
reduced our dataset to 53,083 proﬁles. Further, to run each
proﬁle against various spamming strategies, we needed a cer-
tain number of tweets from each. We set a threshold of 10
tweets within ﬁve days of the data collection day as our
threshold and eliminated proﬁles that tweeted less number
of tweets within the 5-day period. The choice of a 5-day pe-
riod was guided by the intuition that a proﬁle taking much
longer than 5 days to tweet ten times is either inactive dur-
ing our data collection period or was suspended for reasons
other the sending high volume spam. This step pruned our
data set to 14,230 proﬁles. We refer to these proﬁles as suc-
cessful spam proﬁles subsequently in this paper and the rest
of the suspended proﬁles as unsuccessful spam proﬁles.
Figure 1: Lifetime of successful and unsuccessful
spam proﬁles over one month
In the 5-day period, the entire group of 82,274 suspended
proﬁles tweeted 1,353,340 times, of which 2/3rd of the tweets
were from successful spam proﬁles, which comprised only
17% of the proﬁles. In fact, almost half of the tweets from
unsuccessful spam proﬁles arrived on the ﬁrst day of our
data collection. These numbers indicate that most of the
activity from unsuccessful spam proﬁles is front loaded, per-
haps because they get suspended quickly. Figure 1 shows
the percentage of successful and unsuccessful spam proﬁles
that survive on each day for the month of November, 2011.
Since we do not know how long any proﬁle was alive be-
fore November 1st or how long it lived after November 30th,
the lifetimes in this Figure are lower bounds, in that we
underestimate the lifetime of all proﬁles. This Figure shows

Table 1: Tweet types of successful and unsuccessful spam proﬁles and of regular Twitter users
that 70% of unsuccessful spam proﬁles and 15% of successful
spam proﬁles get suspended on the ﬁrst day. Work done by
Thomas et al. a year ago [16] looked at all spammers’ collec-
tively and found that 77% of spam proﬁles were suspended
on the ﬁrst day and 92% within three days. We suspect
that since unsuccessful spam proﬁles are a larger fraction
of proﬁles in our data, that they dominated their data set
as well, potentially masking the behavior of successful spam
proﬁles.
3. TWEET TYPES
Twitter users can send various types of tweets. A basic
tweet, referred to as a regular tweet in the rest of this paper,
is received by all followers of a sender. It appears both on
sender’s home timeline as well as the home timeline of each
of the sender’s followers.
Three other kinds of tweets are allowed in Twitter. The
ﬁrst is called a reply tweet, which is sent as a reply to a tweet.
In addition to appearing on the home timeline of the receiver
provided they are following the sender, a reply tweet appears
on the home timeline of anyone following both the sender
and the recipient. The second type of tweet is a mention
tweet, which is a tweet directed at a speciﬁc Twitter user.
It is much like a reply tweet except that it is more broadly
visible since it appears on the home timeline of anyone who
is following just the sender. Finally, the last type of tweet is
a retweet, which is a mechanism to forward tweets to one’s
followers. This is visible on the home timeline of each of the
sender’s followers.
Note that each user’s home timeline is private to the user,
implying that the tweets appearing there cannot be seen
by anyone else.
In turn, this implies that no one, includ-
ing spammers, can misuse any information contained in the
tweets, such as recipients or tweet content. However, tweets
sent by each user also appear on his/her proﬁle timeline,
which is public by default. Tweets contained there can be
searched and exploited by spammers.
Table 1 shows the tweet types seen in our data. In order
to compare spammer behavior with that of other users, we
randomly picked 100 regular proﬁles in our data. We see
that an overwhelming number of proﬁles across both spam
and other users used regular tweets. Successful spam pro-
ﬁles made the heaviest use of regular tweets, with 89% of
their tweets being regular.
In comparison, half or less of
the tweets from unsuccessful spam proﬁles and other users
were regular. Reply tweets, followed by mentions, were also
popular among unsuccessful spam proﬁles as well as regu-
lar users. Successful spam proﬁles made relatively less use
of these types of tweets, perhaps because Twitter is known
to suspend accounts which send large numbers of replies or
mentions [19].
Retweets were the least popular for both types of spam
proﬁles, with successful ones using them even less than the
unsuccessful ones. Even though retweets were the least pop-
ular among other users as well, they still commanded a sig-
niﬁcant fraction of their tweets. This ﬁnding is intuitive
since spammers get very little leverage out of retweets, which
are similar to unedited forwards of email messages but with-
out any control over the target audience since retweets only
go to one’s followers.
We note that work done by Thomas et al. a year ago [16]
