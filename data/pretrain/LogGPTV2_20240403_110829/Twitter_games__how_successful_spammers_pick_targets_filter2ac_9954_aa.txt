## Abstract
Online social networks like Twitter have surged in popularity, making them attractive targets for spammers. Spammers have evolved their strategies to evade Twitter's anti-spam measures. In this paper, we investigate the tactics used by successful spammers to reach relevant target audiences. By analyzing nearly 20 million tweets from about 7 million Twitter accounts over five days, we identified 14,230 spam accounts that survived longer than 73% of other spam accounts in our dataset. We characterized their behavior, the types of tweets they use, and how they target their audience. Our findings reveal that although spam campaigns have not changed significantly since a recent study by Thomas et al., spammer strategies have evolved, sometimes contradicting earlier observations. Specifically, we identified four major strategies used by 2/3 of the spammers in our dataset, with the most popular being targeting their own followers. The evolution in spammer strategies suggests that frequent studies are necessary to keep up with their adaptations.

## 1. Introduction
Email spam has been a persistent problem for decades. As email spam filters have improved, spammers have turned to new avenues, such as online social networks (OSNs) like Twitter. With 140 million users as of March 2012, Twitter is an obvious target. Fighting spam on OSNs requires new filtering techniques due to the fundamental differences between email and OSNs. For example, Twitter's 140-character limit makes traditional spam filters less effective. Both OSN operators and researchers have been actively pursuing the topic of spam on these platforms.

Recent research on Twitter spam has focused on characterizing spam activity and building classifiers to identify spammers and spam tweets. Our work complements this by examining how spammers pick their targets, which is crucial for protecting potential victims and identifying spammers. This investigation is possible on OSNs because both spammers and targets reside within the same system, unlike traditional email spam.

In our study, we analyzed over 80,000 spam accounts on Twitter to understand their targeting strategies. These strategies are motivated by the functionality provided by popular software used to automate spam on Twitter and the behavior of the worst offenders. Our key contributions are:

- **Strategies for Picking Targets:** We identified five key strategies used by Twitter spammers. The most common strategy is targeting their own followers, which contrasts with earlier findings by Thomas et al. where spammers often failed to garner followers. This change may be due to the thriving underground economy around buying Twitter followers, making it easier for spammers to adapt.
- **Observations about Spammer Behavior:** We found that almost 3/4 of spammers use a specific tweet type exclusively, while only 13% of good users do. Additionally, 2/3 of spammers target only their own followers, compared to 10% of good users. The method used for posting tweets can also predict whether a tweet is spam, as spammers prefer different modes of posting than regular users.

Our findings suggest that spammer strategies need to be re-examined frequently to stay ahead of their evolving tactics.

## 2. Data Collection and Overview
We used Twitter’s streaming API to collect tweets from November 1st, 2011. The API samples one in ten tweets, providing us with 19,991,050 tweets and 7,078,643 unique Twitter user profiles. To identify spam profiles, we used Twitter’s suspension policy as ground truth, resulting in 82,274 suspended profiles. We further filtered these profiles to focus on those tweeting in English and having at least 10 tweets within five days, reducing the dataset to 14,230 profiles. We refer to these as successful spam profiles, and the rest as unsuccessful spam profiles.

Figure 1 shows the lifetime of successful and unsuccessful spam profiles over one month. Most unsuccessful spam profiles were suspended on the first day, while successful profiles lasted longer. This indicates that successful spammers are more adept at evading detection.

## 3. Tweet Types
Twitter allows users to send various types of tweets:
- **Regular Tweets:** Received by all followers and appear on the sender’s and followers’ home timelines.
- **Reply Tweets:** Sent as a reply to a tweet and appear on the home timeline of anyone following both the sender and recipient.
- **Mention Tweets:** Directed at a specific user and visible to anyone following the sender.
- **Retweets:** Forwarded tweets visible to the sender’s followers.

Table 1 compares the tweet types used by successful and unsuccessful spam profiles and regular users. Successful spammers heavily use regular tweets, while unsuccessful spammers and regular users use a mix of tweet types. This suggests that successful spammers avoid drawing attention by using less conspicuous methods.

## 4. Major Strategies Used by Spammers
We identified five major strategies used by spammers to find their targets:
1. **Targeting Own Followers:** The most common strategy, likely due to the ease of acquiring followers.
2. **Targeting Followers of Popular Accounts:** A smaller number of spammers target the followers of popular accounts.
3. **Keyword-Based Targeting:** Some spammers search for users whose tweets contain keywords relevant to their spam campaigns.
4. **Hijacking Trending Topics:** A few spammers hijack popular discussion topics to increase visibility.
5. **Other Methods:** Miscellaneous strategies that do not fall into the above categories.

Understanding these strategies can help in identifying and mitigating spam on Twitter.

## 5. Applications Used by Spammers
We observed that the method used for posting tweets can predict whether a tweet is spam. Spammers often use different applications or methods to post their tweets, which can be a useful feature for spam detection.

## 6. Interesting Observations
Our data revealed several interesting observations, including the rapid evolution of spammer strategies and the effectiveness of targeting one’s own followers. These insights can complement existing spam defenses and help in developing more robust anti-spam measures.

## 7. Related Work
We compare our findings with previous work, particularly the study by Thomas et al. While spam campaigns have remained similar, spammer strategies have evolved significantly in a short period. This highlights the need for frequent re-evaluation of spammer tactics.

## 8. Conclusions
Our study provides valuable insights into the strategies used by successful spammers on Twitter. By understanding how spammers pick their targets, we can develop more effective anti-spam measures. The rapid evolution of spammer tactics underscores the importance of continuous research in this area.
