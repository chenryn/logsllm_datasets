User:  A Baidu cloud server cannot access the external network, how to troubleshoot and solve it?
Assistant: The following are some possible troubleshooting and solutions: 1. Check whether the network configuration of the server is correct, such as whether the IP address, gateway, DNS, etc. are set correctly. You can view and modify the network configuration through command line tools such as ifconfig and route. 2. Confirm that the VPC or network ACL where the server is located is correctly configured with traffic rules to allow the network traffic of the server to enter and exit. 3. Check the server's security group rules to ensure that the required network traffic is properly allowed. For example, if the server needs to access HTTP or HTTPS websites, the corresponding ports 80 and/or 443 need to be opened. 4. Confirm whether the firewall settings of the server are correct and whether the required network traffic will be blocked. 5. If the running application needs to access the external network, you can try to add relevant network configuration or proxy settings in the application code, such as setting the HTTP_PROXY environment variable. 6. If none of the above methods can solve the problem, you can contact the technical support of the cloud service provider to assist in troubleshooting and solving the problem.
