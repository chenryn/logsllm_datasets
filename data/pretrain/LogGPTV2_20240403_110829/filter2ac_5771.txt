Adversaries may exploit external-facing remote services to gain initial access to a network or to maintain persistent presence. These remote services, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), Citrix, and other access mechanisms, enable users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. Typically, these services are managed through remote service gateways that handle connection management and credential authentication. Additionally, services like Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and Virtual Network Computing (VNC) can also be utilized for external access.
