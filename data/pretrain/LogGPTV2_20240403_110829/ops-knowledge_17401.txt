User: I Develop Fairly large python application on server side , with all database connect , files extraction , parsing , command line calls.
It becomes a nightmare for deploying as i used many third party modules outside of standard python lib. And i lost track of them . Especially Differnt Linux OS uses different version of them so it is no longer good to install them using OS's  package manager.
I want to deploy them in all one bundle including current python version i am using (Most OS Still ship with Python 2.5,6 i am using 2.7 and 2.7 specific features.) .
Further more , i have to teach the client to how to deploy , so they can test out in other servers. But they are not linux experts . I have to make it easy , in one script or by doing copy and paste.
There is Portablepython for Windows But there's nothing for Linux. And i had never used python Packaging  as i usually work on server that i only host.
Please enlighten me of avaliable packaging and deployment options for python , that includes all the installed python modules and python itself.

May be VirtualEnv is what you need for this?
