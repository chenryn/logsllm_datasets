### Virtual Private Servers (VPSs)
When using a VPS, the application runs on a virtual machine, allowing access to various countries through OONI and its partners. Some countries, such as Costa Rica, Cambodia, and Tunisia, were excluded from our evaluation because VPS measurements showed less interference than expected, similar to our initial VPN measurements. In China, India, and Iran, we used one VPS each in AS45090, AS14061, and AS62442, respectively. We expect these VPSs to experience the same level of censorship as traditional measurements on personal devices, based on initial results that mirrored user experiences in these countries. VPS measurements can be conducted frequently and continuously, making them essential for collecting a significant number of samples.

### 4.3 Country-specific Host Lists
To gather meaningful results, the tested websites must be relevant in the context of internet censorship and support HTTP/3. To meet these criteria, we first compiled a list of relevant domains and then excluded those that did not support QUIC. As mentioned in Section 2, some domain categories, such as sites with pornographic content, were also excluded. Our initial list included commonly accessed international domains, websites with controversial topics or country-specific restricted content, and sites previously reported as censored. The primary source for these domains was the Citizen Lab Project's censorship test lists, which are widely used in the literature [8, 15, 21]. These lists include approximately 1,400 mostly English-speaking websites and multiple country-specific websites. Additionally, we added the first 4,000 entries from the Tranco Top 1 Million list, which ranks the most frequently accessed domains on the web. This base list was then filtered by making a QUIC request with cURL and removing all domains that did not support QUIC. This process significantly reduced the final host list, with only about 5% of relevant domains passing. Due to the instability of QUIC support for some hosts, we rechecked all remaining domains in a post-processing step (see Section 4.4).

The composition of each country-specific host list is shown in Figure 2. It is important to note that the dataset contains a significant number of .com top-level domains. QUIC is primarily deployed by large internet companies like Google, leading to a bias towards globally popular hosts. Therefore, we expect to see more censorship in countries that heavily censor global targets, such as China.

### 4.4 Data Collection Process
As illustrated in Figure 1, the final measurement process consists of three consecutive phases: input preparation, data collection, and post-processing.

1. **Input Preparation**: The goal of this step is to create a set of request pairs. Each pair includes two HTTP requests to the same target host: one via TCP with TLS and one over QUIC. These requests share the same configuration parameters, including the content of the TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI), the pre-resolved IP address of the target host, and the address of a public DoH resolver. These DNS configurations ensure that the measurements are not biased by DNS manipulation. The requests are saved as JSON objects and used as input for OONI Probe.

2. **Data Collection**: All measurements were conducted between January 15th and March 30th, 2021, at the vantage points described in Section 4.2. At each VPS vantage point, the entire input list was processed in 8-hour intervals. However, due to load variance at the VPSs and temporary server downtime, these intervals sometimes shifted. Table 1 indicates the number of replications and the final sample size for each tested AS.

3. **Post Processing & Validation**: The post-processing step is necessary because some hosts have unstable QUIC support. Random handshake timeout errors can occur, which are indistinguishable from timeout errors caused by censorship. To address this, we retested each failed request from an uncensored network before adding the result to the final dataset. If the request fails again, it is assumed that there is a malfunction at the destination host, and the measurement pair, including both the QUIC and TCP requests, is discarded.

### 5. Evaluation
This section evaluates the state of QUIC blocking by presenting measurement results from vantage points in India, China, Iran, and Kazakhstan. We use HTTPS measurements as a baseline to investigate whether the censor blocks both HTTPS and HTTP/3 connections equally. The tangible measurement results are network failures observed at each connection attempt, such as TLS-hs-to. We use the failure types to determine the most probable cause of the failure. In cases of censorship, the type of failure can help identify the applied blocking method, such as black holing with SNI-based traffic identification.

An overview of our results is shown in Table 1. Note that the final sample size may be smaller than the number of hosts times replications due to invalid requests being filtered out during the validation step.

The very low failure rates of HTTP/3 in AS9198 (Kazakhstan), AS14061, and AS38266 (India) indicate the absence of QUIC censorship at those vantage points. In contrast, the measurements in China, Iran, and India suggest HTTP/3 censorship in the investigated networks. However, not all domains unavailable over TCP are also unavailable over QUIC. This difference is most pronounced in AS45090 (China), where 37.3% of TCP hosts cannot be accessed, compared to only 27.1% of QUIC hosts. Similarly, in the Iranian network AS62442, the failure rate drops from 34.4% to 16.2% when using QUIC instead of TCP. QUIC blocking was also observed in the network of AS55836 in India, where 15% of TCP/TLS connections fail and 12% of HTTP/3 requests. Across all probed networks, the only detected QUIC error type was QUIC-hs-to, suggesting the likely use of black holing as an interference method.

Figure 3 breaks down the observed failure types and shows how the connection response of each tested host changes when using QUIC (right-hand side) instead of TCP. Subsections 5.1 and 5.2 provide a more detailed analysis of these results.

#### 5.1 IP-based Blocking
IP blocking is one of the most common censorship methods. Since traffic is blocked based on the destination IP, it affects both QUIC and TCP traffic. From our measurements, we infer the presence of IP-based blocking in AS45090 (China) and AS55836 (India). The corresponding evidence is listed in Table 2 and will be explained in the following sections.

Due to the larger sample size and temporal consistency, this section focuses particularly on the AS45090 (China) dataset. Three different types of network errors were measured: TCP-hs-to, TLS-hs-to, and conn-reset errors (see Table 1). All hosts that raised an HTTPS connection reset error were still available via HTTP/3 over QUIC. Similarly, in the case of TLS handshake errors over HTTPS, the corresponding HTTP/3 attempt nearly always succeeded. These findings indicate that HTTP/3 over QUIC traffic is less censored than traditional HTTPS via TCP in AS45090. However, if the HTTPS request times out during the TCP handshake (TCP-hs-to), an HTTP/3 request also fails before the QUIC handshake completes.

In such scenarios in AS45090, it is most likely that the destination IP addresses are blocked. Since neither handshake is completed, the response success, TCP-hs-to, route-err, TLS-hs-to, and conn-reset are the observed failure types.
