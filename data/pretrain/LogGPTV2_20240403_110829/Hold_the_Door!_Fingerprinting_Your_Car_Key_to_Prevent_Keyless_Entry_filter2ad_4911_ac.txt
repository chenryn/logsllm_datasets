affect the signal characteristics, we employed the statistical
features to differentiate an attack signal. With the three crafted
features and 20 statistical features used in [33], we ran a
feature selection algorithm to eliminate features that are not
beneﬁcial to performance. From there, we selected the top
ﬁve highest performing features and decided to not employ
all 23 while testing HODOR in consideration of execution
time during the feature extraction phase. As more features are
used, more time is required to compute the features, and this
time delay hinders driver convenience. Moreover, the risk of

to assign equal thresholds to a speciﬁc key fob model. For this
requirement, HODOR performs z-normalization on the output
of the classiﬁer, to compensate for the difference of feature
distribution between the key fobs. Z-normalization calculates
a z-score which has a distribution with a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1. To set a normalization parameter mean
and standard deviation, inspired by the k-fold cross validation
[51], HODOR randomly selects 90 percent of the legitimate
data set for training and 10 percent of the legitimate data
for testing. After repeating 10 times to accumulate the output
of the legitimate test data, HODOR calculates the mean (µ)
and standard deviation (σ) of the corresponding key fob. We
denote this process as Normalization Parameter Calculation
(NPC). In the attack detection phase, output (x) of a classiﬁer
from a newly received signal is normalized as |x−µ|
σ . If any
output from the classiﬁer is not within the indicated threshold
(Γ), the corresponding input is considered malicious. We set
an adequate threshold for each keyless entry system through
evaluation, as shown in the following chapter. Finally, HODOR
rejects the door unlock request if at least one classiﬁer is
deemed malicious. Algorithm 1 illustrates HODOR operation
during training and attack detection.
V. EVALUATION
In this section, we report the evaluation results for HODOR
to show that the system accurately detects attacks deﬁned in
Section III-B. In addition, we performed further evaluations to
demonstrate how HODOR handles environmental factors, such
as temperature variations, NLoS conditions, and battery aging.

A. Experimental Setup
Keyless Entry System. We performed a series of ex-
periments on actual vehicles, a 2014 Kia Soul and 2016
Volkswagen Tiguan. Both vehicle models are equipped with
a PKES system. In the case of the Soul, an FSK modulation
was employed, and a center frequency of 433.92MHz with
a frequency deviation of 30kHz was assigned for UHF-band
RF communication. In the Tiguan, ASK modulation with a
center frequency of 433.92MHz was employed for UHF-band
RF communication.
RF Signal Receiver and Transmitter. For the evaluation
of HODOR, two types of software-deﬁned radio (SDR) devices
were used for the transmission and acquisition of the UHF-
band RF signals. SDR is a radio communication system
that replaces hardware components with a software module.
HackRF One [39] was used to sample the UHF-band RF
signals, and the other HackRF One coupled with a universal
software radio peripheral (USRP) X310 [17] was used to
generate UHF-band RF signals that were to be simulated as
attack signals. With GNU Radio [23], the preprocessing phase
of HODOR was implemented in virtual hardware components.
We set the sample rate of SDR to 5M samples/s in both vehicle
models. Since speciﬁcation of the communication system is
different for the two vehicle models, we assigned different
parameters for each vehicle. The key fob of the Kia Soul
was implemented with a bit rate of 3kbps and a frequency
deviation of 30kHz using FSK modulation. As a result, the
frequency range of the baseband signal begins at 27kHz to
Fig. 9: Experimental setup for ampliﬁcation attack simulation
on the key fob side
33kHz. Ideally, the transition width of a ﬁlter should be zero.
However, since the practical communication system has an
inevitable frequency offset, the receiver must be designed with
a wider bandwidth than in ideal scenarios. Accordingly, we set
the bandwdith of the bandpass ﬁlter to have greater margins
and found the speciﬁc parameter heuristically. Therefore, we
set the high, low cut-off frequencies and transition width of
the bandpass ﬁlter to 15kHz, 45kHz, and 10kHz respectively.
On the other hand, the key fob of the Volkswagen Tiguan
uses a MEGAMOS ID 48 transceiver [62] which utilizes ASK
modulation with a bit rate of 3.5kbps. Therefore, the baseband
signal of a Tiguan has a 7kHz bandwidth. As with the KIA
Soul, considering the frequency offset that occurs in a practical
system, we set the cut-off frequency of the lowpass ﬁlter as
20kHz. In addition, the LF-band RF signals were relayed by
an SMA cable [15] and a loop antenna [14] to simulate the
relay attack. Finally, three RF ampliﬁers were used to simulate
an ampliﬁcation attack, in which the communication range of a
key fob was extended. In our experimental setup, we conﬁrmed
that the vehicle veriﬁes an attack signal as legitimate in every
trial.
Classiﬁcation Algorithm. Classiﬁcation algorithms are
usually categorized as one-class or multi-class classiﬁcation.
Since it is impossible to train for all cases of malicious attacks
before they occur, the classiﬁers should be trained with a set of
features from a legitimate key fob only. In other words, a semi-
supervised one-class classiﬁcation is needed for HODOR to
cover unknown attacks. In our evaluation, a one-class support
vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algo-
rithms were used [49]. The SVM and k-NN algorithms were
performed with the default parameters provided by MatLab
2017a [16]. More speciﬁcally, a residual basis function (RBF)
was used for SVM algorithms, and standardized euclidean
distance was applied for k-NN algorithms, whose parameter
k was set to 1. For each classiﬁer, we collected a set of 100
UHF-band RF signals from a legitimate key fob from a one-
meter distance, and the classiﬁers were trained with them. As
with the training data set, we collected a set of 100 attack
signals in every attack simulation.
Performance Metric. Statistical measures of classiﬁcation
test performance were measured by standard metrics, such
as true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), false
positive rate (FPR), and false negative rate (FNR) [42]. In our
evaluation, TP refers to the case in which HODOR identiﬁed an
attack signal as an attack. Alternatively, TN refers to the case
in which HODOR considered a legitimate signal as legitimate.
FP refers to the case in which HODOR considered a legitimate
signal as an attack and FN refers to the case in which HODOR

as a function of ampliﬁers in an ampliﬁcation attack
Fig. 11: Experimental setup for digital relay attack simulation
considered an attack signal as legitimate. It would only take
one FN case in the keyless entry system to cause a car theft.
Owing to this, we set the objective FNR as 0%, under the
belief that FNR should take precedence over FPR.
B. Single-Band Relay Attack Detection
To simulate the single-band relay attack, we relayed the
LF-band signals to trigger a key fob even if it is out of the LF-
band communication range. An SMA cable and RF ampliﬁer
were used to minimize the path loss of the LF-band signals.
We then sampled the UHF-band RF signals emitted from a
key fob, varying the distance between the vehicle and the
key fob (5m, 10m, and 15m). Fig. 7 shows the experimental
setup for the single-band relay attack simulation. HackRF One
is located on the vehicle side and controlled by a laptop.
Since the signal attenuation becomes larger as the distance
increases, we utilized RF ampliﬁers to increase LF-band signal
strength to relay it to the key fob located more than 10 meters
away. It should be noted that the maximum range that the
UHF-band signal in the PKES system could transmit was
at most 15m in our experimental setup. In addition, we set
the distance between HackRF One and the key fob to one
meter under LoS conditions for capturing legitimate signals.
Fig. 8 shows the output distribution of the k-NN and SVM
algorithms as a function of distance. Due to the nature of the
PKES system, a transmission from an out-of-range key fob is
considered an attack on the PKES system. For the UHF-band
RF signals measured at a distance of 5m, the k-NN and SVM
algorithms both output an FPR of 0%, with an FNR of 0%
at thresholds (ΓP KES) of 4 and 5, respectively. Furthermore,
both algorithms with the same threshold output an FPR of 0%,
with an FNR of 0% where the UHF-band RF signals were
captured at distances of 10 or 15m. As the distance increased,
it became easier to detect a single-band relay attack. Thus, we

conclude that HODOR is able to effectively detect single-band
relay attacks.
C. Dual-Band Relay Attack Detection
We evaluate attack detection performance against two types
of dual-band attacks, (i.e., ampliﬁcation attack, digital relay
attack) which are mentioned in Section III-B.
1) Ampliﬁcation attacks: Since a single-band relay attack
is only possible within the communication range of a key
fob, a victim might easily become suspicious of foul play.
To avoid alerting their victims, adversaries are more likely to
adapt a dual-band attack strategy. A dual-band relay attack
involves relaying the UHF-band signals of a key fob as
well as the LF-band signals of a vehicle. Even though a
key fob is placed out of the communication range, a dual-
band relay attack can still successfully unlock doors. In our
experiments, we ﬁrst applied RF ampliﬁers to extend the UHF-
band communication range. In an ampliﬁcation attack scenario,
the adversary ampliﬁes and forwards the UHF-band signals to
the vehicle. To minimize the path loss between the key fob and
RF ampliﬁer, we directly place the RF ampliﬁer next to the
key fob. Therefore, the UHF-band RF signals were transmitted
much longer distances than the original communication range
permitted. Fig. 9 shows the relay module for the ampliﬁcation
attack simulation. The 12V battery pack supplies DC voltage
to the ampliﬁer, and the experimental setup on the vehicle
side is identical Fig. 7. Deviating slightly from the attack
model
in Section III-B, for experimental convenience, we
relayed the LF-band signal using an SMA cable. Since HODOR
only analyzes the UHF-band signal, this experimental setup
is equivalent to an ampliﬁcation attack model. We employed
several Low Noise Ampliﬁers (LNA) on the UHF band in
a commercial market. Each ampliﬁer (Amp #1, Amp #2,
Amp #3) used for the attack simulation had 30dB, 60dB
and 64dB gains, respectively [1]–[3]. As mentioned in Section
III-B, HODOR sampled the ampliﬁed UHF-band signals, which
had been directly injected by the adversary on the key fob
side. We assumed that the adversary can adjust the SNR level
using a high-quality ampliﬁer or directional antenna, and set
the distance between the adversary and vehicle to the point
where the SNR level is equal to that of legitimate signals. This
