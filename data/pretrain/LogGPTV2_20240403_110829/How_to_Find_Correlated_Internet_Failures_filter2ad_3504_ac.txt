clusions may be limited in that they apply to this data.
Our application of the binomial test upon this dataset allowed us to show
the feasibility of detecting large disruption events (such as power outages during
times of severe thunderstorms) and also much smaller events. The majority of
dependent disruptions last less than an hour although a small fraction continued
for days. Corroborating prior work, we observe that disruption events occur more
frequently at night for some ISPs. However, many disruptions do not aﬀect entire
/24 address blocks, suggesting that prior work may miss detecting them.
Simultaneous renumbering of entire preﬁxes by an ISP would manifest as
a dependent disruption event. However, Richter et al. show that such events
occur rarely in the U.S.; even elsewhere, they occur only in a few ASes [19].
Since Thunderping pings only U.S. addresses, the dependent disruption events
we detected are unlikely to be caused by simultaneous renumbering. We believe
that most of these events are caused by outages and are pursuing eﬀorts to
corroborate our inferences against ground truth.

A Appendix
A.1 Determining Dm in
Section 3.1 described our technique for detecting dependent disruptions through
the calculation of Dmin. Table 1 presents Dmin, computed for various values of N
and Pd. This table shows that, even for large aggregates of IP addresses, often
few simultaneous disruptions are necessary to be able to conﬁdently conclude
that a dependent disruption has occurred.
Table 1. Dmin values for varying values of N and Pd. There is less than 0.01% prob-
ability according to the binomial test that Dmin or more addresses fail for each N
and Pd.

A.2 Analyzing the Conﬁdence of Detected Disruption Events
Here, we examine our conﬁdence in the 20,831 detected dependent disruption
events from Sect. 3.2. The occurrence of Dmin disruptions has less than 0.01%
probability according to the binomial test. We test if most detected dependent
disruption events have exactly 0.01% probability of occurring or if they are well
clear of this threshold.
Figure 8 shows the distribution of the probability that we incorrectly classify
an independent event as dependent. The probability of occurring independently
is less than 0.005% for 90% of the events and less than 0.001% for 75%. Thus,
the probabillity that detected events occurred independently is typically much
smaller than our choice of 0.01%.

Fig. 8. Figure 8 shows the distribution of the probability that the 20,831 detected
dependent disruption events could have occurred independently. For 90% of events,
the probability of occurring independently is less than 0.00005.
A.3 Dependent Disruption Events Across ISPs
We grouped dependent disruption events by ISP to check if any ISPs contribute
an unusual number of events. Figure 9 shows the top 15 ISPs with dependent
disruption events. These top 15 ISPs together account for 13,643 (65%) of all
detected events.
We emphasize that these results are not meant to reﬂect any underlying
problems with these ISPs; Thunderping samples and pings large ISPs more fre-
quently and consequently, ﬁnds more disrupted addresses in them. The purpose
of this analysis is to ensure that no ISP contributes unduly many events.

Fig. 9. Figure 9 shows the number of dependent disruption events detected per ISP.
Note that these numbers are more a reﬂection of addresses sampled and pinged in the
Thunderping dataset than any major underlying problem in their infrastructure. We
leave per-ISP comparisons of dependent disruptions to future work.

Fig. 10. For Comcast, Qwest, and Viasat: Minimum actual disrupted addresses in a
/24 vs. responsive addresses in a /24, for all /24s with at least Dmin address that were
disrupted during a detected dependent disruption event. All ISPs have /24s with actual
disrupted addresses where there continued to be responsive addresses throughout the
disruption.
A.4 Dependent Disruptions May Not Disrupt Entire /24s:
Implications
Continuing our analysis from Sect. 4.4, we investigated if the responsiveness of
other addresses in /24s with actual disrupted addresses would vary across ISPs.
Figure 10 shows per-ISP behavior. We see that all these ISPs have /24s with
actual disrupted addresses where there continued to be responsive addresses
throughout the disruption.
Prior work detecting outages within /24 aggregates may miss these events.
Since a single positive response from an address within a /24 could lead Trinoc-
ular to conclude that the block is alive [18], it can miss dependent disruption
events aﬀecting only a subset of addresses within a /24 address block. Richter
et al.’s technique is capable of detecting partial /24 disruptions [19]; indeed,
many of their disruptions did not aﬀect all addresses in the /24. However, their
choice of the alpha parameter in their technique (alpha = 0.5) meant that they
would only detect disruptions where at least half of the active addresses were dis-
rupted. In this paper, we showed that many /24s with actual disrupted addresses
continued to have more than half of their (sampled) addresses responsive.
We believe that prior work may be able to detect these events by analyzing
broader address aggregates (such as the state-ASN aggregates we use), in addi-
tion to /24 aggregates. In preliminary investigations, we found that many of our
dependent disruption events consisted of multiple observed disrupted /24s that
were each only partially disrupted; that is, a few addresses from many /24s were
disrupted simultaneously but there continued to be other responsive addresses
in these /24s. One of the largest events had 811 addresses from 42 /24 blocks in
the observed disrupted group and 40 of these blocks had responsive addresses.
We leave additional analyses for future work but we believe that we detected
such events due to the broader aggregate of addresses we considered.
