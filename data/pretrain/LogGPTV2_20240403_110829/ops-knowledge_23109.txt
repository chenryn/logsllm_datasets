Question: An online store has a backend process where, after a purchase, if an item is out of stock, it automatically places an order with a partner warehouse. The partner warehouse ships the item and later claims reimbursement. An attacker has found a way to manipulate the system into believing that in-stock items are out-of-stock, triggering orders to the partner warehouse. What is the likely impact of this attack on the online store?
"A": "The partner warehouse will experience a stock surplus due to the miscommunication, leading to inventory management issues.",
"B": "The online store may incur financial losses by reimbursing the partner for items that they actually had in stock.",
"C": "The attack will result in customers receiving their orders faster as the partner warehouse is more efficient in processing orders.",
"D": "The partner warehouse will stop collaborating with the online store due to a breach of the partnership agreement."
Answer: B
