User: From my home pc using putty, I ssh'ed into a remote server, and I ran a python program that takes hours to complete, and as it runs it prints stuff. Now after a while, my internet disconnected, and I had to close and re-open putty and ssh back in. If I type 'top' I can see the python program running in the background with its PID number. Is there a command I can use to basically re-open that process and see it printing its stuff again?
Thanks
Assistant: Things to try:
nohup, or
screen
