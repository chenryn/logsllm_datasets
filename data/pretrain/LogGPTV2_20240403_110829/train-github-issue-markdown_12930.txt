There're some duplicate declarations, for instance:
  * `isValidDirective` (both in `directive_resolver.ts` and `runtime-metadata.ts`, in case #4548 gets merged)
  * `flattenList` (both in `runtime-metadata.ts` and `proto_view_factory.ts`)
It'll be nice if we extract them to separate file and include them wherever
they are required.
If it makes sense I can take this one.
