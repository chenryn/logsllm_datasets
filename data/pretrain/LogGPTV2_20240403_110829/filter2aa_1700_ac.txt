### Vulnerabilities and CVEs

There are more vulnerabilities than there are Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). For example, ARP cache poisoning achieved CVE candidate status in 1999 but never progressed beyond that. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) primarily focuses on vulnerabilities with known exploits, thereby missing what I consider to be the most critical part of the picture.

### Enhancements to CVSS

1. **Distinguishing Exploitability:**
   - CVSS should have a way to distinguish whether a vulnerability is exploitable over the internet versus an internal network. This would allow for better prioritization and focus on cataloging internal vulnerabilities.

2. **Combinatorics:**
   - CVSS needs to incorporate combinatorics to show how a chain of "low-risk" vulnerabilities can lead to a major problem. A potential solution could be an upside-down attack tree, which visually represents the cumulative impact of multiple vulnerabilities.

3. **CAPAC Limitations:**
   - CAPAC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) is not the answer here. The "attack patterns" covered by CAPAC do not address the "chain of separate attacks" I am referring to. Instead, they cover more general patterns like "the pattern all SQL injection attacks follow."

### New Goals for Penetration Testing

Our new goals involve using principles of stealth to mimic real attacks. Real attacks are often blended and involve data exfiltration. Safety is implied; if you cannot be stealthy, safety is not a concern. However, focusing on safety provides other benefits, such as expanding our penetration testing scope to a realistic class of targets. We can convince our clients that safety is the top priority.

### Analogies and Boundaries

Think of the airsoft guns and biodegradable ammo used by today's Opposing Forces (OPFORs). We don't want to take down the people we're trying to train, but we need to set realistic boundaries. For instance, you wouldn't run an OPFOR exercise in an urban area.

### Shells and Data

While shells are cool, we shouldn't be paid for producing them during penetration testing. Blackhats are more interested in credit card information, RSA secrets, product designs, and data that can be monetized. Focusing on data places the emphasis back on the actual target of real-world attacks and allows incident responders to see more realistic data. Our goal is to align the scope of penetration testing with that of blackhats, while adhering to the principle of "safety first."

### Call for Realistic Penetration Testing

I am not alone in calling for more realistic penetration testing. Much of my thinking has been influenced by HD Moore and Valsmith's classes on "Tactical Exploitation," which they presented at DEF CON 15 and SECTOR 2010. They emphasize the importance of long-lived vulnerabilities, such as logic flaws and bad protocol design, over short-lived memory corruption bugs.

### Valsmith and Dave Aitel

Valsmith revisited this topic in 2011, prompting a response from Dave Aitel. Valsmith points out that the exploits he favors, such as logic flaws and protocol design issues, have a much longer shelf-life than memory corruption bugs, which are easier to patch. This aligns with one of the recurring themes in the SpiderLabs Global Security Report: by focusing on these long-lived vulnerabilities, we often exploit ancient flaws like ARP and NetBIOS, and even passwords.

### Haron Meer's Perspective

Haron Meer's talk from 44Con is a good example of someone arguing explicitly for real-world penetration testing and the use of exploits. However, the debate should not revolve around "exploits are good" vs. "exploits are bad." What I advocate for is "safety first." If you can convince me that your exploit won't compromise my target, I will happily use it. Meer's solution is to treat exploits like a trump card in a hybrid tabletop exercise, which works well if your concern is stealth and safety.
