I've been trying to implement Gaussian Processes Regression, which require the
calculation of a matrix inverse. With regular numpy I would use
`np.linalg.inv`, but I can't find this function back in jax.
Everything else is working as expected, and I can use `np.linalg.inv` for
basic calculations.  
Unfortunately, the use of `np.linalg.inv` keeps me from using `grad` to
calculate gradients, which would be the most exciting part of the whole
implementation!
I would love to contribute a PR if someone can tell me where to start.
