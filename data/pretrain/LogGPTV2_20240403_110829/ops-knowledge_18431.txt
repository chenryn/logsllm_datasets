User:  set of Active Directory domain environment is built on Windows Server 2016, please provide a reasonable domain controller backup and recovery plan
Assistant: In order to ensure the high availability and data security of the Active Directory domain environment, the following backup and recovery schemes are recommended: Backup scheme: 1. Regularly back up the system state and system disk, as well as the Active Directory database file NTDS.dit and log files. Backup can be performed directly using the Windows Server Backup tool, or a third-party backup tool. 2. Regularly back up key configuration information such as the system registry in the domain controller, GPO files, scripts in the Netlogon shared directory, authorized DHCP server configurations, and DNS zone files. 3. Regularly back up the system state of Directory Services Repair Mode for forest recovery operations if needed. Recovery Scenarios: 1. Backups can be used to restore the domain controller's system state, data, and configuration files during failure recovery. 2. In the forest recovery operation, all domain controllers must be shut down first, and only one domain controller should be reserved for recovery operation, and the system state should be restored using the backup, and the only DNS server should be configured. 3. After the system is restored, check the system status, network configuration, IP address and other information to ensure the normal operation of the restored domain controller. At this point, all other domain controllers need to be turned on and wait for the synchronization update to complete. 4. If there are still problems after the restoration of the forest, you can use the tools in the directory service repair mode to perform repair operations, such as: Ntdsutil.exe, Eseutil.exe, Replmon.exe, etc. The above backup and recovery plan is only for reference, and the specific plan needs to be adjusted according to the actual situation of the enterprise.
