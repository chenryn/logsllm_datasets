User: How to configure Nginx reverse proxy server to forward HTTP requests to different backend servers and achieve load balancing?
Assistant: To configure the Nginx reverse proxy server and achieve load balancing, you need to perform the following steps: Step 1: Install Nginx On a Linux server, you can use the following command to install Nginx: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx Step 2: Configure reverse proxy To configure the reverse proxy to the proxy, you need to modify the Nginx configuration file and save it in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf. Open the file and add the following in the http section: upstream backend { server backend1.example.com weight=5; server backend2.example.com; server unix:/tmp/backend3; } server { location / { proxy_pass http:// backend; } } This will create an upstream block called backend that contains a list of backend servers that will receive incoming requests. The first line specifies the name, and the remaining lines specify the location of the backend server. The weight parameter can be used to assign more or less load balancing to certain servers. location/ is used to specify the URI to proxy to. This configuration forwards requests to the "backend" wagon we just created. Step 3: Save the changes and restart Nginx When finished, save the changes and restart Nginx for the configuration changes to take effect. sudo systemctl restart nginx Now you have set up an Nginx reverse proxy server that will receive HTTP requests and forward them to different backend servers for load balancing.
