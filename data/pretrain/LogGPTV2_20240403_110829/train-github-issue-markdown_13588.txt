## Issue description
    >>> a = torch.Tensor([1,2,3,4,5])
    >>> a -= a[0]
    >>> a
    tensor([ 0.,  2.,  3.,  4.,  5.])
This seems to be a very confusing result. Even though the below works. I think
the above should at least do broadcasting or throw an exception? Now it is
doing a confusing operation but silent.
    >>> a = torch.Tensor([1,2,3,4,5])
    >>> a -= a[0].item()
    >>> a
    tensor([ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.])
