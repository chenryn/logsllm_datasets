# Bug report
**What is the current behavior?**  
Im using Wallpaper  
and I Get a node: urls error
     App •  ERROR  •  Renderer  in node:util
    UnhandledSchemeError: Reading from "node:util" is not handled by plugins (Unhandled scheme)  .
      Webpack supports "data:" and "file:" URIs by default.
      You may need an additional plugin to handle "node:" URIs.
This might be a duplicate, but i dont understand the other issues because they
were'nt providing a clear solution  
**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**
**What is the expected behavior?**
**Other relevant information:**  
webpack version: 5  
Node.js version: 16.x.x  
Operating System: MacOS  
Additional tools: Quasar, VueJs
