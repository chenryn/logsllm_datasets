of VRPs in APNIC was primarily due to ROAs for three ASNs.10 In
fact, they used to have ROAs that included the MaxLength attribute
to cover a large number of IP prefixes with a single ROA. During
the aforementioned period, however, more than 13,000 VRPs were
introduced separately by disabling all of the MaxLength attributes.
This explains why the number of VRPs spiked, but the fraction of

IP space covered by VRPs remains unchanged. This change was in
fact not initiated by the resource holders, but instead was caused by
the introduction of a new management system at APNIC that uni-
fied management of RPKI and IRR. This system mistakenly started
disaggregating ROAs when existing data was imported into the
system upon launch. When APNIC noticed the sharp increase in
ROAs, they rolled backed this change and reintroduced ROAs with
MaxLength attributes on June 19th, 2017, which makes the number
of VRPs drop back to 7,200 [57]. Similarly, a large jump in VRPs for
RIPENCC on July 31st, 2017 was due to AS8551 (Bezeq International,
Israel). In this case, the resource holder themselves disaggregated
ROAs that used the MaxLength attribute into separate ROAs. This
led to an increase by 3,486 VRPs, whereas again, the fraction of IP
space covered by VRPs remained unchanged.
4.2 BGP Announcements with RPKI
With the knowledge of the number of VRPs that exist, we now
examine how many actual BGP announcements are covered by
VRPs over time. Specifically, we focus on the percentage of BGP
announcements of which IP prefixes are covered by at least one
VRP. Note that having an IP prefix covered by a VRP does not by
itself imply that the BGP announcement is valid (to be valid, it must
be exactly matched with the range of IP prefixes specified in the
VRP); we examine the prevalence of invalid announcements in the
next section.
First, we observe that the number of unique pairs of IP prefixes
with origin ASes is 2.0% ∼ 4.4% higher than the number of unique
IP prefixes as shown in Table 2. This implies that some IP prefixes
are announced by multiple origins. This could be due to intended
purposes such as multi-homing or unintended purposes such as
route leaks or BGP hijacking. We discuss this later in the paper.
Second, Figure 3 plots the fraction of BGP announcements that
are covered by VRPs. A key observation is that the number of
BGP announcements that are verifiable using RPKI is consistently
increasing across all datasets: between 9.98% and 11.28% of BGP
announcements are covered by VRPs in our latest snapshot.
In summary, we observe a surprising level of deployment for
RPKI, both in terms of the number of ASes and the fraction of IP
space covered by VRPs. Next, we explore whether the BGP an-
nouncements covered by VRPs are actually valid or not.

Figure 4: The percentage of invalid BGP announcements
from Akamai, RIPE-RIS, and RouteViews datasets: for the first
two years of its deployment, about 20.76% of the RPKI-
covered BGP announcements are invalid.
5 ROUTE ORIGIN VALIDATION
We now turn to examining the central question in this paper: what
would happen if all ASes deployed RPKI validating routers? Thus, we
focus only on BGP announcements that are verifiable using RPKI
by finding at least one VRP covering the announced IP prefixes;
consistent with prior work [8, 43], we refer to these prefixes as
covered prefixes and these announcements as covered announcements.
We validate all BGP announcements in our datasets by comparing
them with covering VRPs. We do so over the entire history of
our dataset to not only understand the fraction of valid/invalid
announcements today, but to also understand the overall trends.
5.1 Invalid announcements
Recall that a BGP announcement is considered invalid when the
IP prefix is covered by at least one VRP but no VRP matches it; an
announcement is considered unknown when the IP prefix is not
covered by any VRPs.
During the entire measurement period, we observed a total of
46 billion BGP announcements. Of these, 43 billion (91.9%) were
unknown and 3.8 billion (8.1%) were covered; of the covered an-
nouncements, we find that 3.45 billion (90.4%) were valid and that
344 million (9.6%) were invalid.
Figure 4 plots the fraction of all covered BGP announcements
that were invalid that we observed during our measurement period.
However, according to the recommended best practices for network
operators, BGP routes for prefixes more specific than /24 are not
usually accepted to prevent routing table deaggregation [19, 31].
Thus, to obtain the effective BGP announcements that will end
up in BGP tables, we also plot the same graph and filter out the
BGP announcements more specific than /24 in the bottom plot. We
make a number of observations.

gins to drop on September 2018.
First, we observe that a large fraction of covered BGP announce-
ments were actually invalid at the very early stages of RPKI deploy-
ment across all datatsets regardless of /24 filtering; for example,
during 2011, 8,005,538 out of 16,363,056 (48.92%) covered announce-
ments were invalid (in the RouteViews dataset). Interestingly, we
find that 2,199,715 (27.47%) of invalid announcements were due to
announced IP prefixes being covered, but not matched with VRPs
even though their ASNs matched with the VRP ASNs, which implies
potential misconfigurations of VRPs.
Starting from 2012, however, the situation became significantly
better: in our final snapshot, only between 2.25% and 5.39% of the
covered IP prefixes were invalid (depending on the dataset). We
believe the sharp decrease in the fraction of RPKI invalid announce-
ments are due to the RIRs who improved their hosted services and
RPKI training from 2012. For example, the RIPE NCC-hosted inter-
face started to show BGP announcement validity to prefix owners
and offered the option to operators to receive alerts about invalid
announcements. The interfaces of LACNIC and APNIC were simi-
larly modified to show invalid announcements to their users more
clearly.
Second, when we focus on the last 12 months of our measurement
period, we also notice that the overall percentage of invalid prefixes
has further been decreasing since September 2018. A zoomed-in
version of the graph is presented in Figure 5. We believe this is due
to recent efforts from IXPs who adopted RPKI as a service. Some
networks started to drop RPKI invalids either by using this service
or by deploying RPKI validation themselves; for example, DE-CIX
deployed RPKI and started to drop RPKI invalid prefixes in 2019 [50].
Thus, the prefix owners who published invalid RPKI prefixes had
two choices to prevent their announcements from being filtered by
either (a) removing their invalid ROAs or (b) fixing them to match
their announcements. Since we did not observe a drop in RPKI
coverage in Figure 2, we believe that the owners preferred to fix
their ROAs.
5.2 Why BGP announcements are invalid
We just observed that while the fraction of invalid BGP announce-
ments was originally over half of the covered announcements, it
is now much smaller and stable. However, it appears that a non-
trivial fraction of the covered BGP announcements—between 2%
and 5%—are still invalid. We now examine the underlying “reasons”
that make these BGP announcements invalid.
Figure 6: The number of invalid BGP announcements due to
too specific or wrong ASN. Note that the y axis extends up to
21,028 (wrong ASN) on the RouteViews and up to 11,193 (Too
Specific) on the RIPE-RIS dataset.
As we mentioned in Section 2, BGP announcements can be
marked as invalid primarily due to two reasons:
• Too-specific: An announcement would be considered invalid
if the announcement is otherwise valid but the announced IP
prefix is too specific. In other words, the IP prefix is covered by at
least one VRP, and the origin in the announcement is identical
to the VRP ASN, but the announced IP prefix does not exactly
match with the VRP IP prefix. In such a case, it is likely due to
misconfigurations rather than malicious attempts such as prefix
hijacking as the origin AS and VRP ASN are identical.11
• Wrong ASN: The announced prefixes are covered by at least one
VRP, but none of the VRPs match the ASN in the announcement.
These announcements could be malicious as the announcing AS
is not supposed to announce such a prefix. However, it may also
be a configuration error (e.g., ROAs that were not updated when
the IP prefixes were moved to another ASN, or AS multi-homing
where the ROAs were created for one ASN only).
Figure 6 shows the distribution of the reasons during our measure-
ment period. We now dig deeper into each of these two reasons.
5.3 Too-specific announcements
During our measurement period, we observe that on average 48.0%
∼ 51.5% of the invalid announcements are too-specific. For example,
11In theory, an attacker can announce a more specific prefix
and prepend the victim’s AS to the path. However this is unlikely
because the announcement would still appear as RPKI invalid.

this was due to AS 12322 (Free SAS, France), who announced 7,671
invalid IP prefixes, about 96.0% of a total of 7,988 invalid BGP an-
nouncements on that date. When we investigated this, we found
that they published 6 ROAs, which contain 8 IP prefixes; however,
none of them specified the MaxLength attribute to include more
specific IP prefixes. They immediately fixed the issue by adding
the MaxLength field to include more specific IP prefixes on Jan-
uary 22, 2012. Interestingly, we observe that they introduced 8
more ROAs, six of which with a MaxLength attribute on October
23, 2018. However, they again failed to specify a proper value for
MaxLength, which caused nearly 8,800 IP prefixes to go invalid.
Similarly, we also observe another spike on April 16, 2018 on both
the RouteViews and RIPE-RIS datasets; this was due to AS 5089
(Virgin Media Limited), which announced more than 3,200 IP pre-
fixes without setting the MaxLength in the ROAs. Those invalid BGP
announcements would not have occurred if their covering ROAs
had been specified correctly, either by setting a more specific prefix
length in the MaxLength attribute or publishing separate ROAs that
cover the IP prefixes that they announced.
Interestingly, a recent survey study [25] showed that some net-
work administrators were confused regarding the MaxLength at-
tribute; for example, network administrators would incorrectly
assume that the prefix length specified in the ROA would validate
all IP prefixes that are more specific or would not know how to
properly set the MaxLength attribute in ROAs.12
5.3.1 Usage of MaxLength: Now we examine how the
MaxLength attribute is currently being used in ROAs, and why
there have been so many too-specific BGP announcements that end
up being marked as invalid.
We first obtain the IP prefixes from VRPs that do not contain the
MaxLength attribute from all VRPs; Figure 7(a) plots the fraction of
IP prefixes in VRPs without the MaxLength attribute. Interestingly,
we find that the use of MaxLength has been decreasing and only
11.2% of IP prefixes in VRPs use it in our latest snapshot. This aligns
with a previous report [26].
However, when we focus on the actual prefixes that have been
announced through BGP, we see a different behavior. 7(b) compares
the fraction of valid (top) and too-specific IP prefixes (bottom)
where their matched and covered VRPs do not have the MaxLength
attribute. We make a number of observations; we first note that the
MaxLength attribute is widely used to validate BGP announcements;
even though the usage is decreasing, we still see that 52.3% of the
valid IP prefixes are validated through VRPs with the MaxLength
attribute.
We then focus on too-specific announcements; the bottom graph
in 7(b) shows that more than 90% of the too-specific announcements
(and more than 92% in our latest snapshot) are due to VRPs that
do not have the MaxLength attribute. In other words, the majority
of the too-specific announcements could have been validated if
their VRPs were to correctly set the MaxLength attribute or create
explicit VRPs for all the more specifics. This result empirically shows
12For this reason, a recent Internet Draft [24] recommends to
avoid using the MaxLength attribute in ROAs, and publish separate
ROAs covering IP prefixes that authorized ASes may announce.

that some network operators are likely confused about setting the
MaxLength attribute correctly.
As a final example, we look at a steep increase in BGP announce-
ments that are invalid because they are too specific on May 6, 2014;
in fact, the number of too-specific announcements without the
MaxLength attribute in their covered VRPs did not change much
(only less than 40 VRP IP prefixes were added). However, AS 6147
(Telef´onica del Per´u S.A.A, Peru) who previously announced 609 IP
prefixes too-specific (in the RouteViews dataset) due to their nar-
row MaxLength attributes (/19) in their VRPs updated all of their
VRPs to cover more specific prefixes by increasing the MaxLength
attribute to /24. In the plot, this then leaves mostly prefixes that
are too-specific without a MaxLength attribute, as evidenced by
the line rising from around 50% to nearly 90%. This also indicates
that the MaxLength attribute can effectively fix misconfigurations
if used correctly.
As we have seen, it seems to be highly likely that invalid BGP
announcements caused from too-specific IP prefixes are due to
misconfigurations rather than suspicious attempts such as hijacking.
Next, we turn and focus on the BGP announcements originated
from the wrong ASN.

We now examine the fraction of BGP announcements that are cov-
ered, but that are invalid because the origin AS in the announcement
does not match the one in the VRPs. As these announcements are
originated from different (unauthorized) ASes, they could be an
attempt to hijack the IP (sub-)prefixes. However, it does not always
mean that all invalid BGP announcements with wrong ASNs are
hijacking attempts; there could be a number of causes, including
many representing misconfigurations:
• Two different ASNs managed by the same operator: An op-
erator that owns and manages multiple ASNs may update the IP
prefixes without updating the ROAs, thus making the originating
AS in the BGP announcement mismatch with the ASN in the
VRP. To identify this case, we use CAIDA’s AS-organizations
datasets [16] to map ASNs to ISPs, looking for invalid announce-
ments where the conflicting ASes are owned by the same ISP.
• Provider–Customer Relationship: An AS can sub-allocate
part of its IP prefixes to its customers. In such a case, if the
AS publishes ROAs containing the sub-allocated IP prefixes with
its ASN instead of the customer’s ASN, the BGP announcements
originated from the customer will be invalid. We use CAIDA’s
AS relationship dataset [17] to identify relationships between
ASes, looking for invalid announcements where the conflicting
ASes are known to have a provider–customer relationship.
