ABSTRACT
IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking remains a major threat to the security of the
Internet routing system due to a lack of authoritative pre(cid:2)x own-
ership information. Despite many efforts in designing IP pre(cid:2)x
hijack detection schemes, no existing design can satisfy all the crit-
ical requirements of a truly effective system: real-time, accurate,
light-weight, easily and incrementally deployable, as well as ro-
bust in victim noti(cid:2)cation. In this paper, we present a novel ap-
proach that ful(cid:2)lls all these goals by monitoring network reach-
ability from key external transit networks to one’s own network
through lightweight pre(cid:2)x-owner-based active probing. Using the
pre(cid:2)x-owner’s view of reachability, our detection system, ISPY,
can differentiate between IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking and network failures
based on the observation that hijacking is likely to result in topolog-
ically more diverse polluted networks and unreachability. Through
detailed simulations of Internet routing, 25-day deployment in 88
ASes (108 pre(cid:2)xes), and experiments with hijacking events of our
own pre(cid:2)x from multiple locations, we demonstrate that ISPY is
accurate with false negative ratio below 0.45% and false positive
ratio below 0.17%. Furthermore, ISPY is truly real-time; it can
detect hijacking events within a few minutes.

is hijacked may experience reachability problems and cannot easily
identify the actual cause. IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking is essentially a special
form of denial of service attack. Hijacked pre(cid:2)xes can also be used
for carrying out malicious activities, raising the challenge of identi-
fying the actual perpetrator. Eliminating IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking is close
to impossible given today’s routing design, partly due to the lack of
authoritative information on pre(cid:2)x ownerships. Even with such in-
formation, topology can still be spoofed without modifying pre(cid:2)x
owners, resulting in intercepted traf(cid:2)c. Thus, we believe there is
a critical need to design an effective IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking detection
system to inform the mitigation response and help locate the re-
sponsible AS for the attack. Such a detection system should satisfy
all of the following critical requirements:
Real-time: Detection should be real-time to identify short-lived
attacks and minimize potential damage.
Accurate: The detection accuracy must be high, with both low
false positive and false negative ratios.
Light-weight: Detection should be light-weight and scale well
with the number of protected IP pre(cid:2)xes and networks with-
out sacri(cid:2)cing the detection accuracy.
Easy to deploy: The detection system can be easily deployed in-
crementally without requiring privileged access to data such
as live BGP feeds from many ASes.
Incentive to deploy: The system is designed to tie the deployment
effort to the direct bene(cid:2)ts of the deploying organization and
hence creates strong incentives for wide-spread deployment.
Robust in victim noti(cid:2)cation: The system is able to notify the
victim (owner) of the hijacked IP pre(cid:2)x in a robust fashion.
In addition, it is desirable that the system accurately identi-
(cid:2)es and noti(cid:2)es the polluted networks.
Most existing proposals on pre(cid:2)x hijack detection fall into three
categories, as summarized in Table 1, based on the type of infor-
mation used. The (cid:2)rst category of control-plane-based approaches
(e.g., [5, 18, 25]) perform passive monitoring of BGP routing infor-
mation to detect anomalous behavior and hence are easily deploy-
able, but can be fairly inaccurate due to limited BGP data [35] and
legitimate reasons for anomalous updates [12]. The timeliness of
such an approach heavily relies on access to real-time BGP feeds.
The second category of detection systems (e.g., [12]) collect real-
time information from both the control plane and the data plane to
perform joint analysis and hence are real-time, but they also require
privileged access to live BGP feeds and the detection accuracy is
still limited by the vantage point locations of both data sources.
Such limitations can allow attackers to evade detection. The third
category (e.g., [37]) only relies on real-time data plane informa-
tion and hence is more easily deployable via active probing, but

also suffers from the same vantage point limitations. Note that ex-
isting schemes using data-plane information so far have taken an
infrastructure-based approach, relying on a restricted set of net-
work locations to probe pre(cid:2)xes in the entire Internet and hence
suffer from poor scalability. Finally, somewhat ironically, none of
the above proposals have devised a robust way to notify the victim
(owner) of the hijacked IP pre(cid:2)x nor polluted networks, which is
the (cid:2)nal but also a crucial step of the pre(cid:2)x hijack detection pro-
cess.
In this paper, we present an IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking detection system
that satis(cid:2)es all of the above requirements. Our proposed system,
ISPY, exploits a key observation about IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking: due
to the rich connectivity of the ASes in the Internet, a pre(cid:2)x hijack
almost always pollutes a signi(cid:2)cant percentage of the ASes, i.e.,
those ASes will route any packet destined to the hijacked pre(cid:2)x to
the attacker’s network, as opposed to the victim’s network. In other
words, when a pre(cid:2)x hijack is ongoing, the victim’s network will
experience failure in probing a large number of networks, as the
probe reply will be routed to the attacker’s network. This observa-
tion motivates our pre(cid:2)x-owner-centric data-plane-based hijacking
detection system. Essentially, each network deploys ISPY to detect
hijacking of its own pre(cid:2)xes, and ISPY simply performs continu-
ous probing to transit ASes and detects hijacking events based on
the observed reachability to these ASes.
A fundamental difference between ISPY and previous ap-
proaches using data-plane information [37] is that ISPY is pre(cid:2)x-
owner-centric in that each network performs real-time probing in
the data plane to detect potential hijacking of its own pre(cid:2)x(es).
This approach makes the detection system not only real-time and
easy to deploy, same as previous proposals, but also exhibit the fol-
lowing additional properties: (1) accurate as the detection accuracy
is not limited by the placement of any vantage points, (2) creating
strong incentives to deploy as deployment by each pre(cid:2)x owner
directly bene(cid:2)ts itself, (3) light-weight as it is fully decentralized
among the pre(cid:2)x owner networks, and each pre(cid:2)x owner just needs
to continuously probe the over 3000 transit ASes, and (4) intrinsi-
cally robust in victim noti(cid:2)cation as the pre(cid:2)x owner makes hi-
jacking detection decision locally. Furthermore, the pre(cid:2)x-owner-
initiated probing for AS-level paths in ISPY avoids the (cid:2)rewall
problem in previous vantage-point-based probing: since the prob-
ing is initiated from inside the network, the probe packets can usu-
ally exit the pre(cid:2)x owner’s network. Most transit networks enable
ICMP replies; thus, the probes can effectively test reachability to
such networks. Lastly, upon detecting a hijacking event, the victim
network has also identi(cid:2)ed the set of polluted networks and can
notify them of the event, e.g., using a different pre(cid:2)x.
The design and implementation of ISPY face several challenges.
First, it needs to be able to effectively distinguish unreachability
due to a hijacking event from other disruptive routing events such
as link failures, congestion, and miscon(cid:2)gurations. To overcome
this challenge, we propose a pre(cid:2)x-owner’s view of the reachabil-
ity from its network to the rest of the Internet. Such a view consists
of forward AS-level paths taken from the network to reach all the
transit ASes (collected from real-time probing in the data plane).
Using such a pre(cid:2)x-owner’s view of Internet reachability, we show
that unreachability due to hijacking exhibits a very different pattern
in terms of the cuts in the AS-level paths. The number of cuts in
the AS-level paths is then used by ISPY as a unique unreachabil-
ity signature to distinguish hijacking from other disruptive routing
events such as link failures. Despite the high reachability problems
with over 10% of the pre(cid:2)xes in the edge networks as recently
reported by the Hubble system [16], our deployment of ISPY in
88 ASes over a 25-day period has shown that ISPY incurs a very
low false positive ratio, from using the unique unreachability sig-
nature of pre(cid:2)x hijacking, and bene(cid:2)ting from the need to monitor
only reachability to the pre(cid:2)xes of transit ASes which are generally
much more stable than those of edge networks.
As a second challenge, the probing mechanism of ISPYneeds to
be carefully engineered as its performance directly affects the effec-
tiveness of ISPY. In particular, the continuous probing performed
needs to be light-weight to ensure low probing traf(cid:2)c. It must be
ef(cid:2)cient so that each probing round can (cid:2)nish quickly to guarantee
low detection latency. The probing must also be robust to overcome
effects caused by probing-unfriendly events such as ICMP rate lim-
iting, link congestion, and traceroute blocking. A fundamental dif-
ference between ISPY and distributed vantage-point-based mon-
itoring systems (e.g., [16, 37, 20]) is that ISPY is pre(cid:2)x-owner-
centric while pre(cid:2)x hijacking is at the AS-level, and hence a pre(cid:2)x
owner deploying ISPY only needs to monitor the reachability to the
about 3000 transit ASes.1 This low number of monitoring targets
directly contributes to ISPY’s ef(cid:2)ciency and low detection latency.
This paper makes the following contributions. First, we propose
the (cid:2)rst pre(cid:2)x hijack detection system that satis(cid:2)es all six criti-
cal requirements for an effective detection system (see Table 1).
Second, we present the key distinguishing signature of pre(cid:2)x hi-
jacking from other routing failures from the victim network’s point
of view, which forms the underlying foundation for ISPY (Sec-
tion 3). Third, we present the detailed design and implementation
of the pre(cid:2)x-owner-centric probing mechanism demonstrating an
effective working system (Section 4). Fourth, we conduct anal-
ysis and Internet experiments to validate ISPY’s effectiveness in
action (Section 6). We demonstrate that ISPY is light-weight and
can accurately detect pre(cid:2)x hijacking in real time with 0.45% false
negative ratio and 0.17% false positive ratio.
2. BGP PREFIX HIJACKING
In this section, we brie(cid:3)y review IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking targeted at
the interdomain routing protocol. IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking occurs when a
miscon(cid:2)gured or malicious BGP router in a network N either orig-
inates or announces a route to traverse its network for an IP pre(cid:2)x
not owned by itself. Due to a lack of widely deployed security
mechanisms to ensure the correctness of BGP routing updates, for-
warding tables of other networks may be polluted from adopting
and propagating the bogus route. As a result, some of the traf-
(cid:2)c destined to the victim pre(cid:2)x is misrouted to the attacker BGP
1Note that vantage-point-based monitoring systems can often make
use of low overhead probes such as pings (e.g., [16, 37]).
router, which can perform any malicious activities pretending to be
the owner of the victim pre(cid:2)x or may even choose to selectively
forward the traf(cid:2)c back to the victim [4].
For each AS n, it either receives the bogus route or does not at
all observe it. In the former case, it may choose the bogus route if
the route is more preferred and thus become polluted. In the latter
case, n’s neighbors must not be polluted thus preventing n from
observing the bogus route.
IP pre(cid:2)x hijacking can be performed in several ways. We de-
scribe the three main types to facilitate our subsequent discussion
of detection schemes. A more detailed classi(cid:2)cation can be found
in a recent study [12].
1. Regular pre(cid:2)x hijacking occurs when the attack router orig-
inates a route to an existing IP pre(cid:2)x of the victim network.
As a result, the Internet is partially polluted, depending on
how preferable the bogus route is compared to the valid route
from the perspective of various networks.
2. Subpre(cid:2)x hijacking results from stealing a subnet of an exist-
ing pre(cid:2)x in the routing tables by announcing a route for the
subnet originating from the attacker network. Due to longest-
pre(cid:2)x-matching based forwarding, most networks are pol-
luted.
3. Interception-based hijacking is a special case of the regular
pre(cid:2)x hijack in that the attacker network uses one of its un-
polluted neighbors to forward the intercepted traf(cid:2)c back to
the victim.
Our detection system ISPY addresses the basic type of hijack-
ing attack, namely the regular pre(cid:2)x hijacking. In a subpre(cid:2)x hi-
jack, the bogus route for the hijacked subnet will likely be prop-
agated globally, including to the pre(cid:2)x owner, and hence subpre-
(cid:2)x hijacking can be easily detected via simple control-plane tech-
niques such as examining the BGP updates. We also do not address
interception-based hijack [4], as the victim will not observe any
changes in reachability. Interception-based hijack can be partially
addressed by solutions such as encryption [31] for ensuring data
con(cid:2)dentiality and integrity. We plan to investigate performance-
based approaches (e.g., hop count [37] and delay) in our victim-
centric detection framework as future work.
3. KEY OBSERVATION
The design of ISPY exploits a key observation about IP pre(cid:2)x
hijacking: a pre(cid:2)x hijack almost always pollutes a signi(cid:2)cant per-
centage of ASes in the Internet, and hence during a hijacking event,
probes initiated from the victim’s network are expected to witness
unreachability to a large number of ASes. More importantly, this
unreachability to many ASes has a different signature from that due
to a few link failures near the victim’s network, which can also re-
sult in unreachability to many ASes. The unique unreachability sig-
nature of hijacking is used by ISPY to distinguish hijacking from
other disruptive routing events such as link failures and congestion.
In this section, we present a reachability framework that formal-
izes this observation. We (cid:2)rst de(cid:2)ne a pre(cid:2)x owner’s view of the
Internet reachability and motivate the unreachability signature of
hijacking. We then validate the unreachability signature of hijack-
ing via simulations on the AS-level topology of the current Internet.
3.1 Pre(cid:2)x Owner’s View of Internet Reacha-
bility
To facilitate pre(cid:2)x-owner-centric monitoring of potential pre(cid:2)x
hijacking, we need a way to capture the pre(cid:2)x-owner’s view of In-
ternet reachability that can also be easily implemented using exist-
ing probing tools supported in the Internet such as traceroute.
