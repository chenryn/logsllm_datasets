Pilot 2 data and veriﬁed that the RMSE after applying the
models to the ﬁnal data were within these conﬁdence in-
tervals. This enabled us to verify that the models selected
based on our training data were appropriately ﬁt to the
ﬁnal data. All of the models except the model for user
responsibility and the model for local responsibility were
appropriately ﬁt. We retain these two models for analysis
continuity, while acknowledging that a diﬀerent model
might have been a better ﬁt.
Respondents were asked, on a four-point scale from “not
a problem” (1) to “a serious problem” (4), to rate how
problematic they found the discrimination scenario with
which they were presented. The ordering and phrasing of
the scale was taken from a commonly used set of Likert-
type items developed by Vagias [43]. Across all scenarios,
44% of respondents selected a “moderate” (3) or “serious”
(4) problem.
Overall, respondents gave a median rating of “some-
what of a problem” (2) to scenarios in which the dis-
criminatory advertising occurred as a result of the users’
behavior (e.g., Asian people visit technology job sites
more often and thus Asian people saw the ad more often),
compared to a median rating of “moderate problem” for
scenarios in which discrimination occurred due to direct
demographic targeting. In the demographic scenario, 53%
of respondents indicated a moderate or severe problem,
compared to 34% in the behavioral scenario. Figure 4

Table 9: Respondent demographics for the main study.
The Total column is the demographics of the total sam-
ple including both the MTurk and SSI respondents. The
census ﬁgures are from 2015 U.S. Census [41].
Figure 4: Responses for problem severity, broken down
into behavior and demographic conditions.
provides an overview of the scores. If we instead compare
scenarios based on whether a human or algorithm decided
to do the targeting, we ﬁnd the respondents gave a median
rating of “somewhat of a problem” in both cases.
To assess which factors inﬂuence respondents’ percep-
tions of problem severity, we conducted a regression anal-
ysis (as described in Section 5.2.2). Results are shown in
Table 10. Using this analysis, we ﬁnd that respondents’
perception of the severity of the scenario was signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by how the discrimination took place (e.g., based
on users’ online behavior vs. explicitly their demograph-
ics). Behavior-based ad targeting was only 49% as likely
as demographic-based targeting to increase respondents’
severity rating. That is, respondents evidenced less con-
cern when user behavior (in this case, web browsing his-
tory) led to de-facto discrimination than when explicit
demographic targeting yielded the same result.
Respondents also found targeting black and Asian in-
dividuals for more job ads signiﬁcantly less problematic
(58% and 60% as likely to increase severity rating, respec-
tively) than targeting white individuals. On the other hand,

 1 is associated with more responsi-
bility. See Table 10 caption for more detailed explanation.
The implicated entity does not signiﬁcantly aﬀect how
responsibility is assigned to the local news site or end user.
These results, while unsurprising, do help to validate that
our respondents read and understood their assigned sce-
narios. As with problem severity, whether a human or
algorithm made the targeting decision continues to have
no signiﬁcant impact.
Also similarly to problem severity, age proved a signif-
icant factor for three of the four responsibility questions
(not advertiser).
In all three cases, older respondents
were correlated with lower responsibility scores. Finally,
respondents recruited from SSI assigned greater responsi-
bility to the local news site and the end user than MTurk
respondents. Unlike with problem severity, the race of
the respondent appears to have limited correlation with
responsibility assignment in most cases.
5.3.5 Ethical Behavior
Next, we consider respondents’ opinions about whether
each of the four entities behaved ethically. Speciﬁcally,
respondents were asked to agree or disagree that the entity
had behaved ethically, on a ﬁve-point Likert scale from
strongly agree to strongly disagree. Across all scenarios,
75% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the user
behaved ethically (median = agree, or 2). Additionally,
57% of respondents reported that the local news network
behaved ethically (median = agree). On the other hand,
only 49% and 43% agreed or strongly agreed that the
advertiser and ad network, respectively, behaved ethically
(both medians = neutral (3)). We note that these ratings
align well with those observed for responsibility.
The regression results for ethical behavior are shown in
Tables 15–18. Consistent with the ﬁndings from previous
Figure 5: Responsibility scores, per entity, broken down
by the behavioral and demographic conditions.
ad. Respondents provided their responsibility ratings on
a four-point scale including “not at all responsible” (1),
“somewhat responsible” (2), “mostly responsible” (3), and
“completely responsible” (4) [43].
Across scenario types, 63% of respondents rated the
user as “not at all responsible” for the outcome; this was
also the median value. Respondents also did not attribute
a high level of responsibility to the local news network:
the median responsibility score in this case was “some-
what responsible,” with 42% of respondents selecting “not
at all responsible.” On the other hand, only 17% and 18%,
respectively, of respondents rated the ad network and the
advertiser “not at all responsible,” with the median score
for the ad network “mostly responsible” and for the ad-
vertiser “somewhat responsible.” Respondents’ ratings of
responsibility for each entity are shown in Figure 5.
We also applied regression analysis to determine what
factors inﬂuenced respondents ratings of responsibility for
each of these entities. Tables 11–14 illustrate the results
of the regressions for each entity.
For all entities, except for end user, the mechanism by
which the advertisement was targeted (demographics vs.
behavior) is signiﬁcant. The advertiser, ad network, and
local news site all accrue less responsibility when behav-
ior is used. This eﬀect is strongest for the ad network;
respondents are only 33% as likely to rate the ad network
as responsible for the discrimination when demographic
targeting rather than behavioral targeting is used. The
advertiser and ad network also accrue more responsibility
when Asian people are targeted as compared to white
people.
As might be expected, responsibility aligns with the
details of the scenarios seen by the respondents: the ad-
vertiser is assigned more responsibility when the scenario
provided implicates the advertiser than when it implicates
the ad network, and the same holds for the ad network’s
responsibility when the scenario implicates the network.
