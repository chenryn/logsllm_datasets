Asked a bit in the IRC channel and it was suggested that this should be the
case. Basically, if you imagine a real time linter (kind of like Babel's Try
It) that just wants to show errors, or a syntax highlighter that also shows
errors, it would be nice to show Duplicate Declaration Errors (let x = 10; let
x = 10;).
As of right now it appears that the only way to get this is through going
through a transform (as opposed to babylon.parse just throwing it). This is
unfortunate since its a lot of extra work since I won't actually be using the
transform, just wanting to get this one error. I might be wrong here and there
is some in-between step you can do to get this but I don't know.
I am aware that this is kind of a strange error since it waits to happen until
called, so its kind of in the middle, but again unfortunate to require the
full sweep.
