After discussing this topic in the IRC channel, it was suggested that Duplicate Declaration Errors (e.g., `let x = 10; let x = 10;`) should be detectable in real-time. This would be particularly useful for a real-time linter (similar to Babel's "Try It" feature) or a syntax highlighter that also displays errors.

Currently, it seems the only way to catch these errors is by running the code through a transform, as opposed to simply using `babylon.parse`, which does not throw such errors. This approach is unfortunate because it adds unnecessary complexity, especially if the primary goal is just to identify this specific type of error. I may be mistaken, and there could be an intermediate step to achieve this, but I am not aware of one.

I understand that this is a somewhat unique case, as the error is only triggered at runtime. However, it is still undesirable to require a full transformation process just to catch this error.
