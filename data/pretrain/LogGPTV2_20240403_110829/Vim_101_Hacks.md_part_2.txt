### Vim 101 Hacks
**Source:** [www.thegeekstuff.com](http://www.thegeekstuff.com)

#### Basic Navigation Keys
- **j**: Move down one line
- **k**: Move up one line
- **h**: Move left one character
- **l** (lower-case L): Move right one character

**Historical Note:**
The keys `h`, `j`, `k`, and `l` were chosen for navigation because they had arrows on the ADM-3A terminal, which was commonly used with early UNIX systems. If you prefer, you can still use the arrow keys for navigation.

#### Vim Configuration File (~/.vimrc)
- **Local Vimrc:**
  - Configuration options set within a Vim session are valid only for that session.
  - To make settings permanent, add them to the `~/.vimrc` file.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    $ vim ~/.vimrc
    set number
    set list
    ```

- **Location of Local `.vimrc` File:**
  - **UNIX/Linux:** `$HOME/.vimrc` (e.g., `/home/ramesh/.vimrc`)
  - **Windows:** `$HOME/_vimrc` (e.g., `C:\Documents and Settings\ramesh\_vimrc`)

- **Global Vimrc:**
  - For system-wide Vim configuration options.
  - Typically, modify only the local `.vimrc` file.
  - **Location:**
    - **UNIX/Linux:** `$VIM/.vimrc` (e.g., `/usr/share/vim/.vimrc`)
    - **Windows:** `$VIM/_vimrc` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Vim\_vimrc`)
