**Abstract:**
This poster presents an evaluation of security metrics for website fingerprinting (WF) attacks, comparing both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) feature representations. We extend existing security metrics, originally designed for ML-based WF attacks, to evaluate more recent DL-based attacks. Specifically, we analyze the Deep Fingerprinting (DF) attack, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn robust feature representations from raw traffic data. Our experiments, conducted on large datasets, compare the performance of ML and DL features in terms of information leakage, Bayes error, and accuracy. The results show that DL features generally outperform ML features, with some exceptions.

**2. Extending Security Metrics to DL**

The security metrics used in this study were initially designed to analyze handcrafted features developed for early ML-based WF attacks. However, the field has recently shifted towards more powerful DL-based attacks that directly utilize raw traffic information. To evaluate these DL attacks using the existing security metrics, we need to make some adjustments.

In this study, we specifically examine the Deep Fingerprinting (DF) attack. The DF attack uses a CNN model that can automatically learn robust feature representations from raw data. The outputs of the convolutional layers can be considered as the DL model's internal feature representation.

To apply the existing WF metrics to this CNN model, we first extract the learned feature representations. This is done by training the CNN model on a dataset so that the convolutional filters are learned. We then remove the classification and fully-connected layers, leaving only the last convolutional layer, which returns the learned feature representations (see Figure 2).

**3. Evaluation**

For our experiments, we use the large datasets collected by Sirinam et al. [15]. These datasets include 95 sites with 1,000 instances each for both undefended Tor and for Tor with simulated defenses such as WTF-PAD [9] and Tamaraw [4]. For our Walkie-Talkie (W-T) evaluations, we use Sirinam’s W-T dataset, which includes 900 instances each.

We conduct two sets of experiments, varying the feature representation (ML or DL). In the first set, we process data into hand-crafted features using a feature set derived from CUMUL [12] and k-FP [8]. In the second set, we use the DL representation provided by the DF attack model [15].

**3.1 Results**

The results from our experiments are summarized in Table 1. DL features achieve approximately a 20% improvement over ML features when used with the same RF classifier for the WTF-PAD traffic and a 23% improvement for Walkie-Talkie. As expected, the DF attack outperforms the RF classifier in nearly all settings, except for Tamaraw. This is likely due to the 5,000-packet cutoff for trace length used in all DL experiments, which removes the useful total trace length feature, since Tamaraw's high rate of dummy packets leads to very long traces.

**WeFDE Analysis:**
When comparing individual feature leakages to the total feature leakage, we find a surprising mismatch of results. While overall information leakage for undefended, WTF-PAD, and W-T reaches near the maximum possible leakage, the individual leakage measurements show noticeably different patterns. For the undefended dataset, the average leakage per feature value is 1.75 ± 0.50 bits, with a maximum leakage of 2.80 bits. On the other hand, the average leakage for the W-T and WTF-PAD datasets are:

- **W-T:** 1.60 ± 0.40 bits
- **WTF-PAD:** 1.50 ± 0.30 bits

These results highlight the importance of analyzing individual feature leakages in addition to the overall leakage.

**Conclusion:**
Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of DL features in website fingerprinting and the need for careful analysis of individual feature leakages. Future work will focus on further refining these metrics and exploring new defense mechanisms.
