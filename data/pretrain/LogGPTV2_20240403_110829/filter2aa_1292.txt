“Your PoC exﬁltrated email addresses but it seems 
other PII could have been hypothetically at risk. The 
user base was relatively small (a few thousand) as 
this was an experimental project."
“Be sure that any PII that was in your PoC should be 
obfuscated. We are excited that we can be included in 
your talk and help give back to the security 
community."

My bounty account didn’t have 2fac
It’s a trend
Time to clean up and try to 
contain sensitive data while still 
advancing security programs
If you build 
it…
Prepare for 
the worst…
Major requirements
Prevent
Cleanup
If you know conﬁdential or personal data is 
on a system, clean it up - and keep a record 
of the clean up.
Be ready. 
Set policies to prevent data leaks and 
continually enhance them.
Work with your privacy team or compliance 
teams.
