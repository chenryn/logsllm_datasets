## Abstract
In recent years, many medium-to-large Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) have started to offer route servers as a free value-added service to their members. This service has significantly simplified inter-domain routing, enabling members to easily peer with hundreds of networks from the start. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis based on unique datasets from two European IXPs that operate route servers and provided us with extensive BGP and traffic data. Our study correlates a detailed control plane view with a rich data plane view to understand the different peering options available at these IXPs and how major Internet players utilize them. We highlight the critical role of IXPs' route servers in inter-domain routing and demonstrate the benefits of studying IXP peerings with full awareness of traffic. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for both network researchers and operators.

## 1. Introduction
There are currently over 350 Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) worldwide, with some of the largest having more than 500-600 members and carrying as much traffic as global Tier-1 ISPs. With annual membership growth rates of 10-20% and traffic growth rates of 50-100%, IXPs have become key entities in the Internet infrastructure, hosting the majority of today's peering connections. The increasing importance of IXPs is evident in recent studies such as [17, 21, 25, 36].

One of the main reasons for the rise of IXPs is the introduction of route servers (RSes) as a free value-added service. Using an IXP's RS simplifies routing for members, who only need to set up a single BGP session to connect to potentially hundreds of other member ASes. This enables multi-lateral peering (one-to-many) compared to bi-lateral peering (one-to-one). However, little is known about how IXPs operate RSes or how members incorporate RSes into their decision-making processes.

The main contribution of this paper is an in-depth study of IXP RSes, from their architecture and deployment to their use by a wide range of Internet players. Our study combines a detailed control plane view with a rich data plane view to examine how IXPs operate their RSes and how networks make peering decisions. We rely on unique datasets from two European IXPs that operate RSes and provided us with RS-specific BGP data and traffic datasets.

By correlating connectivity and traffic aspects, our analysis highlights the important role of IXP RSes in inter-domain routing. Key observations include:
- RSes enable new and complex peering options and provide open access to a significant portion of Internet routes.
- Multi-lateral peering dominates in terms of the number of peerings but not in terms of traffic.
- RS usage varies across IXPs and members, with certain patterns among similar business types.

These findings have implications for network operators and researchers. For example, the Open-IX initiative aims to establish European-style IXPs in the USA, where the cost of interconnection is high. Our work provides insights into a marketplace where networks have numerous interconnection options and strategic skills. Additionally, our study complements efforts to improve inter-domain routing using technologies like Software Defined Networking (SDN).

For the Internet measurement community, our proprietary datasets can be used to calibrate the quality of BGP measurements, increasing the value of publicly available datasets.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces RS design and operation. Section 3 describes the datasets. Section 4 revisits connectivity-related issues, and Section 5 examines usage-related aspects of peerings. Section 6 looks at peering opportunities and traffic at the level of routed prefixes. Section 7 provides a longitudinal study of peering at IXPs. Section 8 studies how different players implement peering. Sections 9 and 10 discuss trends in Internet peering and related open research problems.

## 2. Trends in IXP Operations
IXPs offer a shared switching fabric where members can exchange traffic once they establish peering connections. This service creates a positive network effect, as more members increase the value of the IXP. In Europe, many IXPs operate on a not-for-profit basis, leading to innovations in service offerings.

### 2.1 Background and Motivation
An important new IXP service offering is the free use of IXP-operated RSes. As more IXPs adopt RSes, their membership grows, and more members use the RS service. This proliferation of multi-lateral peerings creates new peering options and causes members to reconsider their existing arrangements. The ease of joining IXPs and using RSes has led to a trend where one AS can be a member at multiple IXPs, often within the same region. This creates a positive feedback loop, attracting more networks and increasing connectivity and traffic.

### 2.2 The IXP RS as Enabler
Traditionally, connectivity between two ASes is established through a direct BGP session. At IXPs, members initially had to establish bi-lateral BGP sessions, which became cumbersome as IXPs grew. To simplify routing, IXPs introduced RSes. An IXP RS collects routing information from its peers, executes its own BGP decision process, and re-advertises the best routes to all peers. Members connect to the RS via a single BGP session, reducing maintenance overhead. Larger ASes can still establish bi-lateral peerings with selectively-chosen members while using the RS for others.

### 2.3 Deployment History of RSes
The first RSes were deployed in the US around 1995 during the decommissioning of the NSFNET. However, the service did not take off due to the small size of US IXPs. By 2005, an increasing number of European IXPs offered RS capabilities, with Quagga being the de-facto RS. Early versions of Quagga had operational issues, but later versions and OpenBGPD addressed these. In 2008, the BIRD project was relaunched and quickly became the most popular IXP route server. Figure 2 shows the timeline of RS deployments.

### 2.4 BIRD: A Popular Router Daemon for RSes
BIRD is an open-source software routing daemon developed by CZ.NIC Labs and supported by the IXP community. It has been widely adopted, becoming the core routing component of the Netflix Open Connect Appliance since 2013. In the following sections, we describe a BIRD configuration abstracted from the Euro-IX RS example.
