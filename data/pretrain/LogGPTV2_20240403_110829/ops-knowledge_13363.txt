User: Please explain what is RAID technology and its common levels.
Assistant: RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) technology is a technology that combines multiple hard disks into an array to provide high-performance and high-reliability storage solutions. RAID technology can combine multiple hard disks together to form a storage system with large capacity, high performance and good reliability, providing data backup and fault tolerance protection, even if one of the hard disks fails, no data will be lost . The common levels of RAID technology include: 1. RAID 0: striping, which distributes data on multiple hard disks for parallel read and write, improving read and write performance and throughput; but there is no data backup and fault tolerance protection. 2. RAID 1: Mirroring, write data to two hard disks at the same time, provide data backup and fault tolerance protection, but the storage space is only the capacity of one hard disk. 3. RAID 5: stripes plus parity check, the data and its check information are scattered and stored in multiple hard disks, which improves read and write performance, and provides data backup and fault tolerance protection functions, but will be lost when multiple hard disks fail together data. 4. RAID 6: On the basis of RAID 5, the parity bit is added to provide a higher level of data backup and fault tolerance protection, and it can tolerate two hard disk failures at the same time. 5. RAID 10: Combining mirroring and striping, multiple hard disks are divided into two groups, each group is internally mirrored, and then striped, that is, RAID 1+0. Provides high-reliability and high-performance storage solutions.
