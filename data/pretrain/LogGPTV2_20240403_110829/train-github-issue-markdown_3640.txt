# Bug report
## Describe the bug
When I'm deploying a nextjs app, I've got the character `/` appended at the
end of the path, which is not appearing during development.
## To Reproduce
  1. in pages folder, create a component (such as `home.js`)
  2. In development, path will be `/home` if following structure `pages/home.js`
  3. Once deployed (e.g. : `netlify`), path will be `/home/`
## System information
  * OS: macOS 10.13
  * Browser: chrome
  * Version of Next.js: 7.0.2
