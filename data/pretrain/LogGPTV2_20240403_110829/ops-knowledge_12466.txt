User: How to use Ansible automation tool to implement configuration management and deployment tasks for multiple servers?
Assistant: 1. Install Ansible: Install Ansible on a console (which can be Windows, Linux, or Mac) to perform server management tasks on the console. 2. Configure Ansible: The configuration files are ansible.cfg and hosts file, which can be edited with a text editor to ensure correct server configuration. 3. Create the Inventory file: In the Inventory file, each host should have an IP address or a DNS name, and the hosts should be classified with their respective groups. 4. Create a Playbook file: The Playbook file is a YAML file that defines the tasks Ansible should complete on which hosts and how to complete these tasks. 5. Run the Playbook: When running the Playbook file, Ansible checks the hosts in the Inventory file and executes tasks on the groups specified in the file. 6. Monitoring and management: After the Playbook is running, you can monitor and manage the server through Ansible commands and modules. These commands and modules can be used to manage users, profiles and services, and to perform software upgrades and deployments when needed. In short, using Ansible can easily complete the configuration management and deployment tasks of multiple servers, thereby improving work efficiency, reducing error rates, and improving system stability and reliability.
