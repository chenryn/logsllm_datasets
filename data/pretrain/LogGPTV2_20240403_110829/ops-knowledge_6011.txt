User: I have a server which is running CentOS with cpanel/whm. Otherwise, it is pretty much a standard set up.
My problem is that such server is running python 2.4 and I need python 2.6 or later. How do I upgrade without breaking anything?
By the way, I currently have a django application running on that server, which I would also like to move to python 2.6 without breaking it. Is there anything extra that I have to do to do that?
Assistant: You can install any version of python from source as long as you don't overwrite cPanel's python 2.4 installation at /usr/bin.  To do this, use the -prefix= option when you configure the python 2.x or python 3.x source for build.
