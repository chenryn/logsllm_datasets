Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool that provides a wealth of plug-ins and APIs that can support almost all mainstream programming languages and integration tools. It can automatically build, test and deploy applications, and can be integrated with various version control systems and cloud platforms. Through Jenkins, seamless automated deployment can be achieved, thereby improving development efficiency and quality.
