**User:** I need to use rSVG support in Python 2.5.2. It seems that I have to install all 199 dependencies along with the `python-gnome2-desktop` package, which doesn't sound like an ideal solution.

**Are there any alternatives?**

**Assistant:** I ended up installing the entire package, and that provided the rSVG support I needed.
