User: Please introduce the definition and relationship between continuous integration and continuous delivery.
Assistant: Continuous integration means that in the process of software development, after the developers complete the code, they merge their code into the main branch and perform compilation, construction, automated testing and other processes to ensure the quality and consistency of the code and reduce the code integration belt. Risks to come, improve development efficiency and code quality. Continuous delivery refers to sending continuously deployed code to the production environment on the basis of continuous integration. After manual review, testing, and launch, software changes can be released to the production environment in a timely manner, thereby optimizing the software. speed and quality of delivery. It can be said that continuous integration is the basis and prerequisite for continuous delivery. Only when the process of code integration can be effectively managed can the quality of software development and delivery be stable. Continuous delivery is an extension and expansion of continuous integration, which automatically deploys code to the production environment, realizes flexible and efficient delivery control, and ensures that software can be iterated and delivered quickly.
