Threat Planning
A major factor of the engagement is the threat type and characteristics the Red Team must portray.
This is achieved through threat planning. The end state of threat planning is an ability to represent the
threat as closely as possible and to advise the target of implications to the target environment.
Effective planning through the construction of TTPs, profiles, and scenarios significantly improves
the Red Team's ability to ensure the engagement identifies potential threat vectors and assists
defensive operations with identifying gaps in processes, procedures, toolsets, and training.
The level and depth of threat planning are driven by goals and are different on every engagement. At
a minimum, threat planning should include the use of threat TTPs specifically required to achieve a
goal and optionally the characteristics of specific threat actors or threat groups. Consider the
following when planning how a threat will be used during an engagement.
● Threat landscape
What are the target’s characteristics?
What specific TTPs will be required to operate in that environment?
● Threat to the target environment
What are the current threats to an environment identified through OSINT?
What are the current threat concerns of the customer, current issue, or previous
events?
● Real-world examples of threats
What current or prior threats are of concern?
● Threat in scenario or engagement conditions
How will the engagement scenario impact the threat landscape?
● Level of threat capability the team will attempt to emulate
Is the threat capability or level (simple to advanced) important in the
engagement scenario?
A factor Red Team leaders must consider is the realism of the threat. While some organizations may
intentionally decide not to unleash the full capabilities of the threat (e.g., due to the level of target
audience aptitude or environmental constraints), most Red Teams select attack types and strategies to
simulate realistic threats. Exploitation for exploitation's sake or a show of Red Team strength is not
appropriate and will not provide meaningful results. Defining threat-based attacks will provide a
viable mechanism for training the target audience and strengthening the target environment. The Red
Team Lead should carefully weigh the different options in the context of the engagement. This list will
then form the basis of the emerging engagement strategy.
Threat intelligence provides information for analysis, the creation of a threat profile, and
characterization of the threat. A significant factor in the construction of this characterization is the
consideration of the threat's perspective, which can be from inside the target, outside the target, or
having limited access to the target. This profile and characterization information is used to create
threat scenarios. Threat intelligence also feeds the replication of a threat's intent, capabilities, and
TTPs. These can be used to classify and characterize a threat.
Intent
The intent is the "why" in threat operations. The threat's intent may vary greatly depending upon the
target, the sensitivity and value of the target's information, and the desired impacts on both the target
and the threat. A threat’s intent is based on the specifics of an engagement.
A threat may simply want to gather target information. This information is typically something
classified as confidential, proprietary, or intellectual property, and if lost, would be detrimental to an
organization. For example, stolen data could be provided to competitors to build and release in time
with or ahead of the target.
The intent may be to insert faulty or malicious code into the target's current software project. This
code could cause failure or security vulnerabilities at software release. Manipulation scenarios are
an excellent choice to support a supply chain attack scenario.
The threat may want to impact the target’s sales and possibly cause a business failure by releasing
target information to the public.
Intent that directly impacts an organization should be considered during planning over intent that
simply identifies technical flaws.
Capabilities
Capabilities are simply a threat's ability to perform actions given the current funding, technical
knowledge and skill, and target knowledge. A common issue observed in many different industries is
the underestimation of a threat's capability. It is essential to note that information, tools, scripts,
designs, training, etc. available to most information technology and security professionals are also
available to the threat.
TTPs
TTPs are the "how" in threat operations. TTPs are dependent upon the threat's intent and capabilities.
Understanding threat TTPs are extremely useful to both the Red and the Blue Team as the use and
understanding of TTP's is one of the most effective ways to classify and characterize threats by
actions.
Consider these questions when planning threat TTP’s
(Don’t forget to consider the red team’s ability to implement these)
What is the threat’s preferred method of gaining initial access? Web misconfigurations?
Known vulnerabilities? Phishing?
Are there trends in the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)? Things such as file locations,
filenames, system calls, anomalous traffic, etc.
How does the threat perform operations and maintenance against a target? Memory
resident? Binaries? Python? WMI? PowerShell? VBS?
How does the Command and Control (C2) operate? Using what protocols?
Is persistence established? What are the threat’s preferred methods?
Does the threat have a standard or common motive and intent?
A Red Team’s analysis of a threat’s intent, capabilities, and TTPs provides the information required
to create the threat profile. This profile enables the threat characterization used for targeted reviews,
assessments, training, and exercises.
Threat Profile
Planning is vital to emulate a threat or their TTPs. Without a plan, modeling a sophisticated actor can
become extremely difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Too often, Red Teams attempt to emulate a
highly advanced actor, such as "APT group X" or "nation state" with little to no time or budget.
Sophisticated actors have time, money, and resources to build and develop custom tools, exploits, or
techniques. This understanding may seem obvious, but it is important to remember that a Red Team
charged with emulating a specific actor is not that actor. The team may not have the time or budget
needed to emulate a threat perfectly. However, a threat can be emulated just enough to stay within a
reasonable budget, as well as the amount of time, and effort needed to model a threat's core
components.
The Red Team should be helping personnel understand how a specific threat impacts their
organization. To facilitate this practice, a threat profile is used to establish the rules as to how a Red
Team will act and operate. These rules serve as a roadmap for a Red Team by guiding how and what
type of actions should be performed. Even during an in-depth Red Team engagement, a threat profile
should be created to describe the threat and their TTPs.
We've discussed TTPs, but until this point, we haven't provided a means to use them to support an
engagement. Let's start by explaining TTP's through the MITRE ATT&CK framework. MITRE's
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK™) is a curated knowledge
base and model for cyber threat behavior, reflecting the various phases of a threat's lifecycle and the
platforms they are known to target. ATT&CK is useful for understanding security risk against known
threat behavior, for planning security improvements, and verifying defenses work as expected.
ATT&CK is split into Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures. Tactics are the tactical goals a threat may
use during an operation. Techniques describe the actions threats take to achieve their objectives.
Procedures are the technical steps required to perform an action. This framework provides a
classification of all threat actions regardless of the underlying vulnerabilities.
Red teams can emulate realistic TTPs through research and experience, but much of this information
has been compiled in ATT&CK. ATT&CK can be thought of like a menu of TTPs. Red teams can use
this to ensure they have a valid threat profile with a comprehensive set of threat TTPs, and blue teams
can use this to build a scorecard of how well they can defend against the various TTPs.
MITRE ATT&CK Tactics
Initial Access
The initial access tactic represents the vectors adversaries use to gain an initial foothold within a
network.
Execution
The execution tactic represents techniques that result in execution of threat-controlled code on a local
or remote system. This tactic is often used in conjunction with initial access as a means of executing
code once access is obtained, and lateral movement to expand access to remote systems on a network.
Persistence
Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives a threat a persistent
presence on that system. Adversaries will often need to maintain access to systems through
interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote
access tool to restart or alternate backdoor for them to regain access.
Privilege escalation
Privilege escalation is the result of actions that allows a threat to obtain a higher level of permissions
on a system or network. Certain tools or actions require a higher level of privilege to work and are
likely necessary at many points throughout an operation. Adversaries can enter a system with
unprivileged access and must take advantage of a system weakness to obtain local or domain
administrator or SYSTEM/root level privileges. A user account with administrator-like access can
also be used. User accounts with permissions to access specific systems (or perform specific
functions necessary for adversaries to achieve their objective) may also be considered an escalation
of privilege.
Defense evasion
Defense evasion consists of techniques a threat may use to evade detection or avoid other defenses.
Sometimes these actions are the same as or variations of techniques in other categories that have the
added benefit of subverting a particular defense or mitigation. Defense evasion may be considered a
set of attributes the threat applies to all other phases of the operation.
Credential access
Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or
service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to
obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or
domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. This allows the threat to assume
the identity of the account, with all of that account's permissions on the system and network, and
makes it harder for defenders to detect the threat. With sufficient access within a network, a threat can
create accounts for later use within the environment.
Discovery
Discovery consists of techniques that allow the threat to gain knowledge about the system and internal
network. When adversaries gain access to a new system, they must orient themselves to what they
now have control of and what benefits operating from that system give to their current objective or
overall goals during the intrusion. The operating system provides many native tools that aid in this
post-compromise information-gathering phase.
Lateral movement
Lateral movement consists of techniques that enable a threat to access and control remote systems on
a network and could, but does not necessarily, include execution of tools on remote systems. The
lateral movement techniques could allow a threat to gather information from a system without needing
additional tools, such as a remote access tool.
Collection
Collection consists of techniques used to identify and gather information, such as sensitive files, from
a target network prior to exfiltration. This category also covers locations on a system or network
where the threat may look for information to exfiltrate.
Exfiltration
Exfiltration refers to techniques and attributes that result or aid in the threat removing files and
information from a target network. This category also covers locations on a system or network where
the threat may look for information to exfiltrate.
Command and Control
The command and control tactic represents how adversaries communicate with systems under their
control within a target network. There are many ways a threat can establish command and control,
with various levels of covertness, depending on system configuration and network topology. Due to
the wide degree of variation available to the threat at the network level, only the most common
factors were used to describe the differences in command and control. There are still a great many
specific techniques within the documented methods, largely due to how easy it is to define new
protocols and use existing, legitimate protocols and network services for communication.
Creating a Threat Profile by Decomposing a Threat
Threat profiles can be built by decomposing existing threats into core components then recomposing
them into profiles a Red Team can use to describe and execute a Red Team engagement.
The Management Challenge
When a Red Team is asked to perform threat emulation of
a specific actor, the limits of budget, time, and effort can
easily be pushed to the edge.
Strong Red Team leadership is required to bridge the gap
of realism and effectiveness when emulating a threat.
Breaking down a threat into its components and choosing
those items that best exercise the engagement’s goals
provides leadership a roadmap of how the threat will be
accurately represented. In this way, a threat can be
emulated within a budget, time, and resource-constrained
environment.
Creating a threat profile is a great way of establishing the rules as to how a Red Team will act and
operate. These act as a roadmap for a Red Team by providing guidance on how and what type of
actions should be performed. They help all sides (Red and Blue) ensure the Red Team is emulating
the correct threat. Remember, a Red Team engagement is not an all-out hack fest. In many cases, a Red
Team is helping personnel understand how a specific threat impacts an organization. Even during an
in-depth, full-scale Red Team engagement, a threat profile should be created. It helps describe the
threat and their TTPs. This material is ideal for setting the scenario, threading a threat’s story, and can
immensely improve the final report.
Threat Profile Example (Simplified)

The above is a simplified example profile from an actual Red Team engagement. This engagement
was one part of a series of assessments designed to test a Blue Team’s capability of detecting and
profiling a threat. It required the use of defined and specific TTPs. This is the heart of threat
emulation. Defining the profile allowed all parties to be on the same page. At the end of the
assessment, the profile was shared with the Blue Team members to assist the discovery anything that
may have been missed. This provided defenders with the information needed to identify any gaps in
their TTPs, which greatly helped them improve.
The process of decomposing a threat involves:
1. Research of existing threat
2. Breaking down the key elements of a threat profile. (description, goal and intent, key
IOCs, C2 overview, exploitation, and persistence)
3. Recomposing the threat in the form of a profile using information learned and filling
gaps with alternate TTPs (MITRE ATT&CK is a great source to help fill these gaps)
Threat Profile Usage
Threat profiles typically support the engagement story and are used to describe the technical aspects
of a single C2 channel. A single threat profile is used for each C2 channel.
At the end of this chapter, you will have the opportunity to work through a threat profile exercise.
Let’s examine an example of a real attack to illustrate the concept of a threat profile.
A review of a blackhat's tradecraft
This real-world attack will provide context and understanding of how an attack may occur. As you
read through the summary, think about how you could use this in planning and scoping a red team
engagement.
How HackingTeam Got Hacked
Phineas Fisher, a.k.a. Hack Back!, claims responsibility for the Hacking Team attack and release of
documents. The documents were released to WikiLeaks on July 8, 2015. In April 2016, Phineas
Fisher published a report explaining how the Hacking Team attack was accomplished. It was first
written in Spanish and later translated into English.
Tweet Sent from HT’s Twitter account after it was controlled by Phineas Fisher
Hacking Team, an Italian company, is known for selling intrusion and surveillance software to
governments, law enforcement agencies, and corporations. We will not focus on whether you agree
with their practices or not. What is interesting here is the opportunity to review a black hat's
Tradecraft. Why? A Red Team may need to defend their position on how and why they acted in a
certain way. It is common for target organizations to claim that specific techniques are not real or that
a threat “would not do that”. This article is a great reference to use in threat emulation. The TTPs
described are not only are useful in performing an engagement but can help confirm that a Red Team's
actions are threat faithful. Threat faithful engagements that closely mimic a realistic threat, are very
believable and a great way to demonstrate practical adversarial activity.

How the Hack[12] Went Down
Attack Diagram of Hacking Team highlighting major steps
Fisher started by analyzing the target. Fisher recognized that spear-phishing was risky. "I didn't want
to try to spear phish Hacking Team, as their whole business is helping governments spear phish
their opponents, so they'd be much more likely to recognize and investigate a spear phishing
attempt." Early analysis showed the Hacking Team's network appeared to be hardened and to have a
small attack surface. Initial analysis revealed an updated version of Joomla!, a mail server, a couple
of routers, a VPN appliance, and a spam filter. Gaining initial access was not straightforward.
