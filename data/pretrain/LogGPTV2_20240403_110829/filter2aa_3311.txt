About Caleb:
Programming for about 18 years.
I most enjoy hacking and mathy stuff (Signal processing, Machine Learning, AI)
In general, I ﬁnd it interesting to hear the "unhearable", see the "unseeable"
- to tune in to the subtleties around us.
In the computer world, everything is black and white, but the real world is
fuzzy and colorful.
Ontologically, I think the best way to describe myself is as a "Christian Mystic".
I also love Art - Literature, Music, Artsy movies, etc. I'm also an occasional and
unaccomplished poet.
Possible titles for this talk:
Intercepting, modifying, and generating wireless signals with SDR
How digital data is transmitted wirelessly
Controlling wireless IoT devices via crafted radio signals
How the OSI Physical layer works and how to attack it
Background on what led me to doing this stuff - came in from 3 directions:
IoT
Music theory -> Sound analysis
Wireless hacking
We'll be exploring the Physical layer
Harness the invisible energy all around us!
IoT: +5000% attack damage to all wireless hacking
skills
Things that work through radio:
"Radio" (AM, FM)
TV
Cell phones
Wiﬁ
Bluetooth
GPS
Wireless security systems
Any form of Wireless IoT device
SCADA systems / large industrial equipment
Software-Deﬁned Radio (SDR)
HackRF One
LimeSDR
RTL-SDR
In the Wizard/Sorceress metaphor, this is your wand (along with the antenna, of
course).
Sidenote: when using radios, your body can actually become a part of the
antenna, which is very like magical lore - THE ENERGY IS FLOWING THROUGH
YOU!

Understanding waves
What are waves?
Interesting things about waves
They are everywhere
Epitome of change
Superposition principle (wave convolution)
Convoluted waves can be deconvoluted
Orthogonality of waves of differing frequencies
Relation to e
Waves are found everywhere!
Anywhere there is circular motion or vibration, there are waves.
All wireless communication
Sounds waves
Radio waves
Infrared, microwave, etc
Motion of pendulums and springs
Light from the sun at a given place on earth
Temperature on earth
Patterns of the tides
Patterns of breathing
All over moden physics
Quantum Field Theory posits that particles are excitations (waves) in various ﬁelds.
We know from Einstein that matter and energy are related, and since waves are the
epitome of energy, this makes sense.
Possibly the basis for all matter
String Theory posits that everything is made out of small VIBRATING strings
Uncertainty Principle
I accidentally stumbled on the Uncertainty Principle when doing audio analysis
The more samples you take, the more certain you can be of the frequencies
contained
But the more samples you take, the less localized in time you are.
Application: So understanding waves helps you understand the universe!
Waves are the epitome of change
Or to put it another way, "energy".
Calculus deals with change through the "derivative" - the rate of change of a function.
Waves are one of the only graphs for which the derivative of the function is a version
of itself!
The other one I know of is e^x, but there's a reason for that... waves and e are
intimately related in Euler's Formula, e^ix = cos(x) + i sin(x).
More on that in a minute.
Superposition principle
How can you hear many things at once?
How can there be multiple radio waves in the air at the same time which can be
tuned into?
Superposition principle: waves are added together to form more complicated wave
patterns.
Relation to radio hacking: The superposition principle is how there can be many
different radio signals in the air at the same time.
Deconvolution is possible
Because waves of differing frequencies are orthogonal, a convoluted wave (made of
multiple frequencies) can be broken into each of its component frequencies.
This can be done with the Fourier Transform.
Time domain
Frequency domain
Relation to radio hacking: Deconvolution is basically how we "tune into" a particular
radio frequency.
But how is this possible?
Say I have 10 numbers, and I "convolute" (add) them together - you couldn't break
them back into the original numbers. So how can you do this with waves?
Orthogonality of waves of differing
Orthogonality of waves of differing
frequencies
frequencies
You can think of the set of all waves as forming
Hilbert space where each frequency wave is a different
dimension.
You can only deconvolute orthogonal components:
If you have 2 "components" in the same that are not orthogonal, you can't ever
deconvolute them.
Even if they are not fully in the same dimension, if the
vectors are not orthogonal, you can't fully recover the
components:
But you can fully recover the orthogonal components:
And that holds for higher dimensions too:
Relation to radio hacking: this is how, when you tune into a particular frequency, you
don't get tons of interference from all the other waves in the air.
Relation to e
Euler's Formula relates e^x to sin(x) and cos(x):
This is also where we get Euler's Identity:
At x = π, sin(π) = 0, and cos(π) = -1
So e^iπ = -1 + 0
Move the 1 over: e^iπ + 1 = 0
Complex sin waves
Relation to radio hacking: Radio waves are actually transmitted as complex waves,
not simple waves, so if we want to craft our own radio waves to control things, we'll
need to use complex sine waves.
How does digital communication happen over waves?
Modems
"Modem" = "MOdulator" + "DEModulator"
Modulation
Modulation: manipulating a "carrier" wave to carry information.
Types of digital modulation:
Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)
Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)
Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)
Used by many simpler devices
This is the type the wireless outlets I'm controlling uses
Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)
Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
Essentially, this is a combination of ASK and PSK
This is what modern WiFi mostly uses.

Conclusions
All wireless digital communications happens over EM waves.
And though some of the ways information is represented, all of it is still
just plain ol' EM waves.
Now you know how the fundamentals of all radio communication happens!
Including some freakin' awesome foundational math.
Be aware of the potential attack vectors that all wireless systems:
Jamming attacks - not a lot to mitigate this type of attack; but and it's
good to be aware of that. A few possible mitigation schemes:
Spread spectrum radio
Channel hopping
Active low - so if the signal goes away, consider that "triggered"
Replay attacks - make sure rolling codes are good
Brute force attacks - make sure key space is large enough and random
enough
Mixed replay+brute force?
Be wary of wireless communication, and keep this stuff in mind when analyzing
all the new IoT devices coming out!
Thanks!
