### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://jsfiddle.net/ae82rfnv/
### Steps to reproduce
While operating, carefully notice of the transitions
Working flow
  1. tick first box (parent transition plays)
  2. tick second box (child transition plays)
  3. untick second box (child transition plays)
  4. untick first box (parent transition plays)
Broken flow n°1
  1. tick first box (parent transition plays)
  2. tick second box (child transition plays)
  3. untick first box (only parent transition plays)
Broken flow n°2
  1. tick second box (nothing happens)
  2. tick first box (the 2 transitions play in sync)
  3. untick first box (only parent transition plays)
### What is expected?
While unmounting, a transition should search for nested transition and
operates in sequence carefully, running children transition first, then
playing its own transition before unmounting, so all children transition could
run their "leave" transition carefully.
### What is actually happening?
Only the parent transiton runs, ignoring the children transition.

I understand why it does what it does as is, and it makes sense from mounting
point of view ; where the logic fails is in the "final effect" : while the 2
transitions (parent and child) play correctly when mounting, it doesn't run
"the opposite way/backwards" when unmounting.
