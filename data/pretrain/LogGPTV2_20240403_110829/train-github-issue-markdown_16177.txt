Description: There is constraint "All" that allows us to provide several
fundamental constraints that all has to be valid for validation to pass. There
is no constraint "Any" for which we can provide several fundamental
constraints expecting at least one of those to be valid.
Example: We can, per example, have several classes, Invoice, ProInvoice,
DebitNote, CreditNote (accounting). For some property path, we can expect for,
per example, Invoice or ProInvoice to be provided, example:
    @Assert\Any([ @Assert\Type(type="Model\Invoice"), @Assert\Type(type="Model\ProInvoice") ])
This can be done differently, via Callback validator, or Expression validator,
or whatever...
However, "Any" seams a "syntactic sugar", if there is no reason for "No" I
would like to submit a PR.
