In my static folder I have the following symlink:
    semantic.min.css -> ../node_modules/semantic-ui-css/semantic.min.css
When I do a `next export` it copies the symlink into the `out/static` folder.
It would make more sense for it to read the contents of the file that is
symlinked to and place that into the `out/static` folder.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Read the contents of the file pointed to by the symlink and place that into
the `out/static` folder.
## Current Behavior
Symlink is copied.
## Context
I'm symlinking a file in my node_modules directory into my static directory so
whatever version is installed by npm is immediately accessible and so that I
don't have to commit that 3rd party modules file into git. Now I'm having to
manually replace the symlink in the out folder after each export.
