### Example Code
    This route, based on Closed Issue https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/131#issuecomment-1177187775, works, and shows how one can alias a path parameter.
    @router.get("/api/users/{id}/profile/")
    def user_profile(user_id: int = Path(None, alias="id")):
        return {
            "id": user_id,
            "username": "johndoe"
        }
This route, using `"user-id"` instead of `"id"` as the alias, does not work.
    @router.get("/api/users1/{user-id}/profile/")
    def user_profile(user_id: int = Path(None, alias="user-id")):
        return {
            "id": user_id,
            "username": "johndoe"
        }
    ### Description
    Both `Query()` and `Path()` have an `alias` feature.  `Query()` aliases can contain hyphens, but `Path()` aliases cannot.  This appears to be a bug, as the [doc](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/path-params-numeric-validations/#declare-metadata) says about Path metadata
    > You can declare all the same parameters as for Query.
