### Issue with FreeCodeCamp Challenge: Bring Your JavaScript Slot Machine to Life

The challenge at [http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-slot-machine-to-life](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-bring-your-javascript-slot-machine-to-life) has an inconsistency in the second condition.

#### Condition Description
The second condition states:
> You should have used the selector provided in the description to select each slot and assign it the value of `slotOne`, `slotTwo`, and `slotThree` respectively.

#### Selector in the Description
The selector provided in the description is:
```javascript
$($(".slot")[0]).html(slotOne);
```

#### Issue
The condition passes when you use double quotes in the selector, as specified in the description:
```javascript
$($(".slot")[0]).html(slotOne);
$($(".slot")[1]).html(slotTwo);
$($(".slot")[2]).html(slotThree);
```

However, the condition fails if single quotes are used:
```javascript
$($('.slot')[0]).html(slotOne);
$($('.slot')[1]).html(slotTwo);
$($('.slot')[2]).html(slotThree);
```

#### Possible Explanation
This behavior might be due to an attempt to conform to the jQuery JavaScript Style Guide. However, both single and double quotes are valid in JavaScript. In fact, the subsequent challenge, "Waypoint: Give your JavaScript Slot Machine some stylish images," uses single quotes in the description and accepts either single or double quotes:
```javascript
$($('.slot')[0]).html('');
```

#### Screenshots

- **Passing with Double Quotes:**

#### Conclusion
To ensure consistency and avoid confusion, the challenge should accept both single and double quotes, as both are valid in JavaScript. This would align with the behavior of the subsequent challenge and the general flexibility of JavaScript syntax.
