### Analysis of Components and Safety Mechanisms

#### Timeline Models
The analysis should begin with a comprehensive evaluation of all components within the barrier. Properly constructed timeline models, where events correspond to known repair times, are essential. By linking the `EventOccurredX` place with the `DoRepair` place for each component, the model accurately represents and evaluates these aspects.

#### Isolation of Safety Mechanisms
The "Isolation of Safety Mechanism" field in the Work Permit (WP) provides critical information about which components are disabled during the work. For each event that triggers the isolation (or restoration) of a safety mechanism, an instance of the `Disabler` template is added. The `DisablingStart` and `DisablingEnd` places are shared with the places corresponding to the events that trigger the beginning or end of the disabling phase. These could be, for example, `EventOccurredX` places in the timeline model. The `Disabled` place is connected to the `Disabled` place of all components being disabled by this event.

#### Concurrent Work
Concurrent work must be considered during the evaluation. The model is extended to include elements from WPs that have been released but not yet completed. The same procedure as in previous steps is repeated for all concurrent WPs, reusing the already introduced template instances for components and events, to create a unique global model.

#### Metrics and Evaluation
Metrics are defined by the architectural barrier model. The metrics evaluated are the union of those specified for all relevant barriers for the WP. These metrics are translated into reward structures and evaluated at time \( t_{end} \), which is the time when the work specified in the WP application is expected to end.

### Case Study

#### Application to a Real Scenario
This section demonstrates the application of our approach to a real scenario devised with domain experts.

##### The “Gas Leakage” Scenario
One of the hazardous events that might occur during work on a petroleum installation is gas ignition, which can result in serious damage to people and infrastructure. A key barrier to prevent such an event is the detection of gas leakage, which can be automated or manual.

We consider a generic area X, where three gas detectors (A, B, and C) are operating. The area can be logically divided into two parts: X1, where A and B are located, and X2, where C is located. Detectors A and B are close to each other and can independently detect a gas leakage in X1. They can also detect a gas leakage in X2, but only after a delay due to higher gas concentration. Conversely, C can detect a gas leakage in X2 almost immediately but will detect a gas leakage in X1 only after some delay. Detectors A, B, and C may have different failure distributions, including omission failures (missing the gas detection) and late failures (detecting the gas with a delay).

This scenario is a simplified version of a real barrier setup, which can include more details in both physical and cyber dimensions. Gas sensors can be decomposed into an initiator (the physical unit that senses the gas) and a logic solver (the device interpreting the data, containing a CPU). Together, they form a Safety Instrumented Function (SIF).

Gas can also be detected manually by smell, portable detectors, or techniques like smearing liquids on potential leakage areas and looking for bubbles. Gas detectors and manual gas detection form a barrier against fire ignition caused by gas leakage in area X, called "GasDetectionX".

In our example, we consider two WP applications for work in area X:
- **WP1**: An application for hot work (e.g., welding) in area X.
- **WP2**: An already released work permit for replacing one of the gas sensors, to be performed concurrently with WP1.

The evaluation of WP1 follows the workflow in Figure 2. The analysis identifies possible risks and associated barrier models. In our example, the "GasDetectionX" barrier model is retrieved.

A possible representation of the architectural model of this barrier is sketched in Figure 11. The model includes two events: gas leakage in area X1 and gas leakage in area X2, occurring according to exponential probability distributions with rates \(\lambda_{x1}\) and \(\lambda_{x2}\), respectively. The barrier consists of four components: three physical components (gas sensors) and one logical component for manual gas detection. Sensors' failure distributions are exponential, with rates \(\lambda_A\), \(\lambda_B\), and \(\lambda_C\). Sensors can fail in two modes: "late" or "omission," with given probabilities.

The "Manual Gas Detection" component can detect both events. The event can be detected on time, late, or undetected, with probabilities given by parameters \(p_{manu\_ontime}\), \(p_{manu\_late}\), and \(p_{manu\_undetected}\). Gas sensors can also detect both events, with their detection probabilities depending on their working state and the event to be detected. For example, if not failed, sensors A and B detect event X1 on time with a probability of 0.9 and late with a probability of 0.1. They will always detect event X2 late, with a probability of 1.0, due to gas propagation across the two zones. If failed in the "omission" mode, the probability of detecting any event on time or late is always 0.

Metrics of interest for this barrier relate to the two events: leakage in X1 and X2. Specifically, for any event E, we consider:
- \(pE_{late}\): the probability that the event occurs and is not detected on time.
- \(pE_{undet}\): the probability that the event occurs and is not detected at all.

The analysis of concurrent work identifies WP2 as a possible conflicting work, as it operates on components of the same barrier (gas detectors). WP2 is included in the analysis model to establish its impact on risk-related metrics associated with the execution of the work in WP1.

##### Analysis Model Construction
The analysis model is constructed following the procedure in Section V.B. The "Events" step generates two instances of the `EventOccurrence` template, one for each leakage event. The "Components" step generates four `GenericComponent` instances, one for manual detection and three for gas sensors. Steps "Error propagation" and "Propagation of events" do not generate additional template instances. The "Detection facilities" step generates eight `Detector` instances, one for each (component, event) pair. The "Timeline" step generates four `Timeline` instances, one for the WP and three for the history of the gas sensors. Finally, the "Isolation of safety mechanisms" and "Current work" steps generate three `Disabler` instances. All these instances are connected based on their interfaces.

##### Evaluation and Results
The model is evaluated using the Möbius tool [17] with at least \(10^7\) batches, a relative confidence half-interval of 10%, and a confidence level of 99%. Constraints for acceptable risk are:
- Probability of late detection should be below \(10^{-4}\).
- Probability of missed detection should be below \(10^{-6}\).

Results with nominal parameters from Table I are reported in Figure 13. Four cases are compared: WP1 in isolation and WP1 with WP2, considering different sensors as the target of disconnection. Based on the constraints, WP1 in isolation could be accepted, although the probability of detecting X2 late is near the threshold. If WP2 is considered, WP1 can be accepted only if sensor A is disconnected. If sensor C or B is disconnected, a warning should be raised, and the request for WP1 should be rejected.

The generated model for the scenario consists of a total of 21 instances of templates: 2 `EventOccurrence`, 4 `GenericComponent`, 8 `Detector`, 4 `Timeline`, and 3 `Disabler` (Figure 12).

##### Parameters and Default Values
Table I lists the parameters used for the evaluation, their default values, sources of information, and the model templates to which they apply. Some parameters, like the probability of manual detection, may be difficult to estimate, but historical data can be used for similar quantities. Current default values are based on datasheets and expert judgment.
