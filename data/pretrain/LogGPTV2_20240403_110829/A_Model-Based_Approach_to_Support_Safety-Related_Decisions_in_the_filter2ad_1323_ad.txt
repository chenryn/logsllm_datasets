those of all the components in the barrier, should then be con-
sidered as the starting point of the analysis. With properly cre-
ated Timeline models, in which events occur in correspondence 
of  known  repair  times,  and  connecting  EventOcurredX  place 
with the DoRepair place of the corresponding component, this 
aspect can be represented and evaluated correctly. 
Isolation  of  safety  mechanisms.  The  “Isolation  of  safety 
mechanism” field of the WP conveys the important information 
of which components are disabled during the work. For each 
event that triggers the isolation (and restore) of a safety mecha-
nism,  an  instance  of  the  Disabler  template  is  added.  Places 
DisablingStart  and  DisablingEnd  are  shared  with  the  places 
corresponding  to  the  events  that  trigger  the  beginning  or  the 
end of the disabling phase. These could be, for example, Even-
tOccurredX  places  in  the  Timeline  model.  Place  Disabled  is 
connected to the Disabled place of all the components that are 
being disabled by this event. 
Concurrent work. Work that is being undertaken or is going 
to be undertaken concurrently to the WP under analysis needs 
to be taken into account during the evaluation. To this end, the 
model  is  extended  with  elements  from  WPs  that  have  been 
already released, but for which work has not been completed 
yet. The same procedure as in the previous steps is repeated for 
all  concurrent  WPs,  reusing  the  already  introduced  template 
instances  for  components  and  events,  so  that  a  unique  global 
model is obtained. 
Metrics and evaluation. Metrics are specified by the archi-
tectural barrier model. Metrics that are evaluated are the union 
of the metrics specified for all the barriers that are relevant for 
the WP. These metrics are translated to reward structures, and 
evaluated at time tend, with tend being the time at which the work 
specified in the WP application is supposed to end.  
VI.  CASE STUDY 
In  this  section  we  show  the  application  of  our  approach  to  a 
real scenario devised with domain experts. 
A.  The “Gas Leakage” Scenario 
One of the hazardous events that might occur during work 
on a petroleum installation is gas ignition, which may result in 
very serious damage to people and/or the infrastructure. One of 
the barriers to avoid such an event is the detection of gas leak-
age, which may be automated or manual.  
282
We consider a generic area X, in which three gas detectors 
are operating: A, B, and C. The area can be logically divided in 
two parts, X1, where A and B are located, and X2, where C is 
located. Gas detectors A and B are located close to each other, 
and  both  are  able  to  detect  a  gas  leakage  that  occurs  in  X1, 
independently from each other. They are also able to detect a 
gas leakage occurring in X2, but only after gas concentration 
has become higher, thus only after some delay. Conversely, C 
is able to detect a gas leakage occurring in X2 in a negligible 
amount of time; it will also detect a gas leakage occurring in 
X1, but only after some delay. Gas detectors A, B and C may 
potentially be of different types and have different failure dis-
tributions.  Each  may  fail  by  missing  to  detect  the  gas  at  all 
(omission failure) or by detecting the gas, but only after a time 
delay (late failure).  
The presented scenario is a simplification of a real barrier 
setup,  which  can  include  further  details,  both  in  the  physical 
and in the cyber dimensions. For example, gas sensors can be 
decomposed into an initiator (i.e., the physical unit that senses 
the  gas),  and  a  logic  solver  (i.e.,  the  device  interpreting  the 
data, which contains a CPU). Together they are typically con-
sidered a single Safety Instrumented Function (SIF), e.g., see 
[24].  
Gas can also be detected manually (i.e., by people on the 
rig): by smell, portable detectors, or techniques such as smear-
ing liquids on a potential leakage area and looking for bubbles. 
Gas detectors and manual gas detection form a barrier against 
the fire ignition caused by gas leakage in area X. We call this 
barrier “GasDetectionX”. 
In the scenario we use as example we consider two WP ap-
plications for work in area X: 
•  WP1: The work permit under analysis. It is an applica-
tion for hot work (e.g., welding) to be performed in area 
X. 
•  WP2: An already released work permit for work within 
area X. Approved work consists in the replacement of 
one of the gas sensors. This work would be performed 
in parallel with the work in WP1. 
The evaluation of WP1 proceeds according to the workflow 
in Fig. 2. The analysis of the kind of work (hot work) and of the 
location (Area X) identifies the possible risks and the associat-
ed  barrier  models.  In  our  example,  the  model  for  the 
“GasDetectionX” barrier is retrieved. 
A possible representation of the architectural model of this 
barrier is sketched in Fig. 11. The model includes two events of 
interest,  gas  leakage  in  area X1,  and gas  leakage  in  area X2, 
occurring  according  to  an  exponential  probability  distribution 
with  rate  Ȝx1  and  Ȝx2,  respectively.  The  barrier  itself  is  com-
posed  of  four  components:  three  physical  components  (gas 
sensors)  and  one  logical  component,  representing  the  manual 
detection of gas. Sensors failure distributions are exponential, 
with  rate  ȜA,  ȜB,  and  ȜC;  sensors  fail  in  two  possible  failure 
modes: “late” or “omission”, with a given probability. 
The  “Manual  Gas  Detection”  component  can  detect  both 
the events of interest. The event can be detected on time, de-
tected late, or undetected, with probability values given by pa-

rameters  p_manu_ontime,  p_manu_late,  p_manu_undetected 
respectively. Also gas sensors can detect both events of inter-
est. Their detection probabilities are given by a combination of 
their working state (healthy, “late” failure mode, or “omission” 
failure mode) and the event to be detected. For example, if not 
failed, sensors A and B detect event X1 on time with probabil-
ity  0.9  and  late  with  probability  0.1,  while  they  will  always 
detect  event  X2  late,  with  probability  1.0,  since  gas  has  to 
propagate across the two zones. When failed in the “omission” 
failure mode, the probability of a gas sensor to detect any event 
on time, or late is always 0. 
Metrics of interest for this barrier relate to the two events of 
interest: leakage in X1 and in X2. More in detail, for any of the 
two events E we consider: i) the probability that the event oc-
curs and it is not detected on time, pE
late; ii) the probability that 
the event occurs and it is not detected at all, pE
undet. 
The analysis of concurrent work identifies WP2 as a possi-
ble  conflicting  work,  since  it  operates  on  components  of  the 
same barrier (gas detectors). WP2 is thus included in the analy-
sis  model,  in  order  to  establish  its  impact  on  the  risk-related 
metrics associated with the execution of the work in WP1.  
B.  Analysis Model Construction 
The analysis model is constructed following the procedure 
in Section V.B. The “Events” step generates 2 instances of the 
EventOccurrence  template,  one  for  each  of  the  two  leakage 
events; the “Components” step generates 4 GenericComponent 
instances, one for the manual detection element, and three for 
the gas sensors. Steps “Error propagation” and “Propagation of 
events”  do  not  generate  in  this  case  additional  template  in-
stances.  Step  “Detection  facilities”  generates  8  Detector  in-
stances, one for each pair (component,event) such that compo-
nent is able to detect the event. The “Timeline” step generates 
4 Timeline instances, one to model the timeline of the WP, and 
the  other  three  to  model  the  history  of  the  three  gas  sensors. 
Finally,  the  “Isolation  of  safety  mechanisms”  and  “Current 
work” steps generate the three Disabler instances. As previous-
ly  explained,  all  these  instances  are  connected  based on  their 
interfaces.

to provide insights on the following main questions:  
i)  How  do  metrics  change  if  considering  only  WP1  in 
isolation, or considering both WP1 and WP2?  
ii)  How do metrics change if the sensor that is disabled 
by WP2 is sensor A, B, or C?  
iii)  What is the impact on metrics of variations of key pa-
rameters?  
Responding  to  these  questions  demonstrate  the  usefulness 
of the approach in different system conditions, as those reflect 
questions that may be raised by decision makers, or to support 
more long-term planning of work activities on an installation. 
We assume to have the following constraints to fulfill as indi-
cators of acceptable risk: i) probability of late detection should 
be below 10-4, and ii) probability of missed detection should be 
below 10-6. The model has been evaluated with the simulator 
provided with the Möbius tool [17], with at least 107 batches, a 
relative confidence half-interval of 10%, and a confidence level 
of 99%. 
Results  with  the  nominal  parameters  from  Table  I  are  re-
ported in Fig. 13. Four cases are compared: the case in which 
only  WP1  is  considered  in  isolation,  and  the  cases  in  which 
WP2  is  included  in  the  evaluation,  each  time  considering  a 
different  sensor  as  the  target  of  disconnection.  Based  on  the 
above stated constraints, WP1 in isolation could be accepted, 
although  the  probability  of  detecting  X2  late  is  near  to  the 
threshold.  If  considering  WP2  as  parallel  work,  WP1  can  be 
accepted only if the sensor that is disconnected is A. In case the 
sensor  that  is  going  to  be  disconnected  is  C  or  B,  a  warning 
should  be  raised  instead:  in  the  first  case,  the  probability  of 
detecting  X2  late  is  above  the  threshold;  in  the  second  case 
both the probabilities of not detecting X1 and X2 are above the 
threshold. In these cases, the request for WP1 should be reject-
ed. 
Fig. 12. Generated model for the evaluation of the example 
scenario. 
The obtained model for the scenario of interest consists of a 
total of 21 instances of templates selected form the library in 
Section V.A: 2 EventOccurrence, 4 GenericComponent, 8 De-
tector, 4 Timeline, 3 Disabler (Fig. 12). 
C.  Evaluation and Results 
The  default  parameters  that  we  use  for  the  evaluation  are 
reported in Table I. For each of them, we report its default val-
ue,  the  source  of  information  for  determining  such  value,  as 
well as the model template on which it applies. Some parame-
ters, like the probability of manual detection, may be difficult 
to estimate; however, it should be noted that other state-of-the 
art analysis approaches suggest to use historical data for similar 
quantities (e.g., see [6]). Current default values have been de-
vised  partially  on  datasheets,  and  partially  based  on  our  own 
judgment.  
In the evaluation we have performed in this paper we tried
