D. Feelings and Sentiments
AS PART OF OUR QUESTIONNAIRE, WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS FOR 3 FEELINGS ABOUT THE BLACKLIST WARNING. WE CODED AND ANALYZED THESE
FEELINGS FROM A SAMPLE OF 130 PARTICIPANTS THAT ENCOUNTERED A BLACKLIST. WE ALSO INCLUDED 21 PARTICIPANTS THAT ONLY IMAGINED
HITTING A BLACKLIST. BELOW, WE LIST THE TOP 20 REPORTED FEELINGS. TWO CODERS INDEPENDENTLY CODED THE DATA AND THE LEVEL OF
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CODERS, MEASURED BY COHEN’S KAPPA WAS κ = 0.91. QUESTION: “Please describe three general feelings or reactions that
you had after you received this warning message.” OR “Please describe three general feelings or reactions that you would have had after you received this

E. PIN Selection and Changing Strategies
WE CODED AND ANALYZED A SAMPLE OF 200 PIN SELECTION STRATEGIES. BELOW, WE LIST THE TOP 10 SELECTION STRATEGIES. TWO CODERS
INDEPENDENTLY CODED THE DATA. THE LEVEL OF AGREEMENT AMONG THE CODERS, MEASURED BY COHEN’S KAPPA, WAS κ = 0.92. QUESTION:
“People use different strategies for choosing their PINs. Below, we will ask about your strategy. What was your strategy for choosing your PIN?”

“To just chose an easy PIN.”
“I used the numbers from the current time 04:33 PM.”
“I used the ﬁrst four digits of a friend’s phone number.”
WE CODED AND ANALYZED A SAMPLE OF 126 PIN CHANGING STRATEGIES OF PARTICIPANTS THAT ENCOUNTERED A BLACKLIST AND IN RESPONSE
CHANGED THEIR PIN. BELOW WE LIST AND EXPLAIN OUR CODES. TWO CODERS INDEPENDENTLY CODED THE DATA. THE LEVEL OF AGREEMENT
AMONG THE CODERS, MEASURED BY COHEN’S KAPPA WAS κ = 0.96. QUESTION: “After receiving the warning message, please describe how or if your
strategy changed when choosing your PIN.”
