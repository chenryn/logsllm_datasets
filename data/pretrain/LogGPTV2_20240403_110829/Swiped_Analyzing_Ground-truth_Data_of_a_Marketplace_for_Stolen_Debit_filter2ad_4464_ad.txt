Table 2: Magnetic stripe accounts from U.S. issuers, seg-
mented by the top 10 issuers, issuer size (both in terms of total
spend), the four major card networks, and card type. Gross
spend and median price of purchased accounts are in USD.
Supply corresponds to all accounts available for purchase. Re-
funds relative to number of accounts purchased; some were
non-refundable. Certain features appear to make accounts
more valuable to carders. For example, buyers purchased a
higher fraction of the available inventory for accounts from
small and medium-size issuers compared to all but one of the
top 10 issuers, and paid a higher median price.
7.2 International Accounts
Non-U.S. accounts made up 7% of magnetic stripe accounts
available in the shop, but accounted for a disproportionately
higher 14% of magnetic stripe revenue. Support tickets indi-
cated that these international magnetic stripe accounts were
likely being used to commit fraud within the U.S. Table 3
shows aggregate statistics for magnetic stripe accounts from
issuers outside of the U.S. Compared to the U.S., carders
bought a higher fraction of the inventory for 7 of the 10 most
popular international countries. Carders also purchased more
expensive accounts, with the median price of international
magnetic stripe accounts almost twice that of the U.S. This
points to anti-fraud measures of international accounts being
perceived as weak when used within the U.S.
The supply of international accounts was more restricted
than that of the U.S. A large portion of these accounts were
added in a few distinct releases, indicating that many of the in-
ternational accounts likely came from large isolated breaches.
For international banks, discovering and responding to these
breaches would signiﬁcantly limit fraud.

Table 3: Magnetic stripe accounts segmented by country of
the issuer. Gross spend and median price of purchased ac-
counts are in USD. Refunds relative to number of accounts
purchased; some were non-refundable. Purchase rates and in-
ventory varied considerably, such as 17.4% of 170 k accounts
in the U.K., 39.7% of 17.4 M in the U.S., and 83.3% of 32.2 k
in Spain. Median purchase prices for accounts from the U.S.
and Canada were lower than all other countries.
Chinese accounts were consistently popular throughout
the duration of the dataset. They were almost 50% more
expensive than the next highest priced country, and over four
times more expensive than U.S. accounts. In late 2018 and
early 2019, a single seller added more than 15,000 Chinese
magnetic stripe accounts to the shop, a large majority of
which were non-EMV cards (82%) and priced at over $100
per account. As we will discuss in Section 8, magnetic stripes
extracted from non-EMV cards might be easier to monetize
than magnetic stripes from EMV cards, driving up buyer
demand and cost. The shopkeeper also mentioned in support
tickets that Chinese accounts typically had poor anti-fraud
protections when used within the United States. Australian
accounts were the second most expensive, and drove part of
the revenue spike in late 2015 and early 2016 when a seller
uploaded over 25,000 such accounts to the shop. Canada was
the second most popular country in terms of spending, and
exhibited similar demand and pricing characteristics as U.S.
accounts, probably due to their close proximity.
In summary, we found that carders had apparent prefer-
ences for certain issuers and card types. These preferences
suggest that carders expected different fraud gains, potentially
based on perceived differences in anti-fraud measures. In-
creased sharing of expertise and intelligence could help the
“weaker” issuers improve their defenses, especially in the case
of international banks targeted for fraud in the U.S.
8 U.S. EMV Chip Deployment
In order to reduce fraud from counterfeit payment cards, is-
suers have begun equipping their cards with an EMV chip in
addition to the magnetic stripe. These chips, in contrast to
magnetic stripes, are thought to be more secure against du-
plication attacks. To discourage merchants from processing
magnetic stripe transactions, card networks imposed a liability
shift for card-present transactions involving counterfeit cards.
In the U.S., it took effect on October 1, 2015 [19]. (Other
major markets had already implemented a similar liability
shift prior to that date.) Since this date, merchants, not banks,
have been responsible for fraud losses when a card equipped
with an EMV chip is processed as a magnetic stripe swipe
instead of reading the chip. We study the impact of increasing
EMV adoption on the carder shop, especially with regard to
the availability and pricing of magnetic stripe data, which is
required to produce counterfeit cards for in-store purchases.
From a supply perspective, this data can only be stolen when
merchants read the magnetic stripe instead of the chip. This
may occur when merchants are unwilling or unable to process
chip transactions. For example, at the time of writing, there is
still an exception from the liability shift for gas pump transac-
tions [5], and there were reports of merchants disabling chip
transactions during peak holiday shopping periods in 2015 to
shorten checkout times [15]. Our analysis in this section is
limited to U.S. magnetic stripe accounts, since EMV is not
used for CNP transactions, and other countries had already
completed their transition to EMV.
Supply of EMV and non-EMV accounts. The liability shift
occurred 10 months after the start of the leaked data. Overall
supply of magnetic stripe accounts continued to grow signiﬁ-
cantly until the end of the dataset, as discussed in Section 5.4.
This suggests that breached merchants were still processing
large numbers of magnetic stripe transactions, despite the
incentive to read the chip. Figure 10 shows that most of this
magnetic stripe data was stolen from cards equipped with a
chip. New supplies of chipless accounts decreased after the li-
ability shift, but never went to zero. Instead, supply remained
at a relatively stable level during the last years of the dataset.
In terms of stock available for purchase in the shop, there
was an oversupply of EMV accounts. The supply of EMV
accounts nearly doubled every year, such as a 93% increase
from 2017 to 2018. However, only 35% of EMV accounts
added after the liability shift were purchased. In contrast,
84.2% of non-EMV accounts were purchased, and available
stock was effectively shrinking from 359,351 accounts after
the liability shift to 192,078 accounts after 2018. As Figure 11
shows, new non-EMV supply was added at a pace similar to
the purchase rate, but existing older stock was lost due to the
cards reaching their expiration dates.
Sales of non-EMV accounts made up 67.1% of the shop’s
gross revenue before the liability shift, but only 30.4% af-
terwards. EMV sales increased from 32.7% to 68.7%. This
increase appeared to be driven mostly by volume, not prices.
Around the time of the liability shift, buyers paid a median
price of $20.37 for EMV compared to $14.45 for non-EMV ac-
counts. In early 2016, however, the median purchase price of

Figure 10: Weekly supply of U.S. magnetic stripe data.
Even three years after the EMV liability shift (of October
2015), there was signiﬁcant increase in supply, suggesting
that breached merchants were still processing large numbers
of magnetic stripe transactions. Most of the magnetic stripe
data was stolen from cards equipped with a chip, but there
appeared to be a relatively steady supply of chipless cards,
suggesting that non-EMV cards were still being issued.
EMV accounts sharply decreased to $9.76, and has remained
consistently lower than non-EMV accounts since then. Buy-
ers were willing to spend more for non-EMV accounts, but
their supply was limited. (Figure 15 in the appendix shows
longitudinal pricing for EMV and non-EMV accounts.)
Continued supply of non-EMV accounts. Even three years
after the liability shift, the shop continued to receive new sup-
plies of non-EMV accounts. One hypothesis to explain this
phenomenon is that these accounts were mostly invalid. How-
ever, the 29.8% refund rate for non-EMV accounts was not
much higher than the 23.8% refund rate for EMV accounts.
Another hypothesis is that these non-EMV accounts might
have been issued before the liability shift, and the issuer was
waiting for them to expire before reissuing them with EMV.
