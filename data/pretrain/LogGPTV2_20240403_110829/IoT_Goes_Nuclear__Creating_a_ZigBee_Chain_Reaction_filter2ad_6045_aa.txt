Abstract—Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will
densely populate our cities. In this paper we describe a new
type of threat in which adjacent IoT devices will infect each
other with a worm that will rapidly spread over large areas,
provided that the density of compatible IoT devices exceeds a
certain critical mass. In particular, we developed and veriﬁed
such an infection using the popular Philips Hue smart lamps
as a platform. The worm spreads by jumping directly from
one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee
wireless connectivity and their physical proximity. The attack
can start by plugging in a single infected bulb anywhere in
the city, and then catastrophically spread everywhere within
minutes. It enables the attacker to turn all the city lights on
or off, to permanently brick them, or to exploit them in a
massive DDOS attack. To demonstrate the risks involved, we
use results from percolation theory to estimate the critical mass
of installed devices for a typical city such as Paris whose area
is about 105 square kilometers: The chain reaction will ﬁzzle
if there are fewer than about 15,000 randomly located smart
lamps in the whole city, but will spread everywhere when the
number exceeds this critical mass (which had almost certainly
been surpassed already).
To make such an attack possible, we had to ﬁnd a way
to remotely yank already installed lamps from their current
networks, and to perform over-the-air ﬁrmware updates. We
overcame the ﬁrst problem by discovering and exploiting a
major bug in the implementation of the Touchlink part of
the ZigBee Light Link protocol, which is supposed to stop
such attempts with a proximity test. To solve the second
problem, we developed a new version of a side channel attack to
extract the global AES-CCM key (for each device type) that
Philips uses to encrypt and authenticate new ﬁrmware. We
used only readily available equipment costing a few hundred
dollars, and managed to ﬁnd this key without seeing any actual
updates. This demonstrates once again how difﬁcult it is to get
security right even for a large company that uses standard
cryptographic techniques to protect a major product.
1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) is currently going through
exponential growth, and some experts estimate that within
the next ﬁve years more than ﬁfty billion “things” will be
connected to the internet. Most of them will be cheaply
made sensors and actuators which are likely to be very inse-
cure. The potential dangers of the proliferation of vulnerable
IoT devices had just been demonstrated by the massive
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on the Dyn DNS
company, which exploited well known attack vectors such
as default passwords and the outdated TELNET service to
take control of millions of web cameras made by a single
Chinese manufacturer [1].
In this paper we describe a much more worrying situa-
tion: We show that without giving it much thought, we are
going to populate our homes, ofﬁces, and neighborhoods
with a dense network of billions of tiny transmitters and
receivers that have ad-hoc networking capabilities. These
IoT devices can directly talk to each other, creating a
new unintended communication medium that completely
bypasses the traditional forms of communication such as
telephony and the internet. What we demonstrate in this
paper is that even IoT devices made by big companies
with deep knowledge of security, which are protected by
industry-standard cryptographic techniques, can be misused
by hackers to create a new kind of attack: By using this
new communication medium to spread infectious malware
from one IoT device to all its physically adjacent neighbors,
hackers can rapidly cause city-wide disruptions which are
very difﬁcult to stop and to investigate.
We focus in this paper on the popular Philips Hue smart
lamps which had been sold (especially in the European
market) in large numbers since 2012. The communication
between the lamps and their controllers is carried out by the
Zigbee protocol, which is the radio link of choice between
many IoT devices due to its simplicity, wide availability, low
cost, low power consumption, robustness, and long range (its
main disadvantage compared to WiFi radio communication
is its limited bandwidth, which is not a real problem in most
IoT applications). The Hue lamps contain a ZigBee chip
made by Atmel, which uses multiple layers of cryptographic
and non-cryptographic protection to prevent hackers from
misusing the lamps once they are securely connected with
their controllers. In particular, they will ignore any request
to reset or to change their afﬁliation unless it is sent from
a ZigBee transmitter which is only a few centimeters away

from the lamp. Even though the attacker can try to spoof
such a proximity test by using very high power transmitters,
the fact that the received power decreases quadratically with
the distance makes such brute force attacks very hard (even
at ranges of a hundred meters). This requires high power
dedicated equipment and cannot be done with the standard
ZigBee off the shelf equipment.
Our initial discovery was that the Atmel stack has a
major bug in its proximity test, which enables any standard
ZigBee transmitter (which can be bought for a few dol-
lars in the form of an tiny evaluation board) to initiate a
factory reset procedure which will dissociate lamps from
their current controllers, up to a range of 400 meters.
Once this is achieved, the transmitter can issue additional
instructions which will take full control of all those lamps.
We demonstrated this with a real war-driving experiment
in which we drove around our university campus and took
full control of all the Hue smart lamps installed in buildings
along the car’s path. Due to the small size, low weight, and
minimal power consumption of the required equipment, and
the fact that the attack can be automated, we managed to
tie a fully autonomous attack kit below a standard drone,
and performed war-ﬂying in which we ﬂew hundreds of
meters away from ofﬁce buildings, forcing all the Hue lamps
installed in them to disconnect from their current controllers
and to blink SOS in morse code.
By ﬂying such a drone in a zig-zag pattern high over a
city, an attacker can disable all the Philips Hue smart lamps
in city centers within a few minutes. Even though such an
attack can have very unpleasant consequences, its effects are
only temporary since they can be reversed by the tedious
process of bringing each lamp to within a few centimeters
from its legitimate controller and reassociating them.
To test whether the attacker can cause more permanent
damage, we used a combination of known and novel tech-
niques in order to reverse engineer the process chosen by
Philips in order to make a lamp ﬁrmware update possible.
We did it only by using updates for older light models as
reference, without ever seeing any actual ﬁrmware update
issued by Philips for the new Atmel chip. We discovered that
in order to be accepted by the lamp, each ﬁrmware update
had to be both encrypted and authenticated by AES-CCM (in
which AES is used to encrypt a Counter with CBC-MAC);
however, all the lamps (at least from the same product type)
use the same global key. We managed to deduce all the
secret cryptographic elements used by Philips (such as IV
and key) within a few days, using novel side channel attacks
that used only cheap and easily obtained equipment costing a
few hundred dollars, and without physically extracting them
from their secure memory. Once we obtained these secret
values, we could create any new ﬁrmware and upload it into
any Philips Hue lamp.
We have thus demonstrated that a really devastating
low-budget attack can be mounted on this IoT system: A
single infected lamp with a modiﬁed ﬁrmware which is
plugged-in anywhere in the city can start an explosive chain
reaction in which each lamp will infect and replace the
ﬁrmware in all its neighbors within a range of up to a
few hundred meters. This is similar to the worm scenario
which was accidentally triggered by Robert Morris Jr., and
brought the whole internet to a standstill within minutes in
1988. To avoid any similar accidental outcome due to our
experiments, the only change we actually made in the new
ﬁrmware we installed in the infected lamps was to change
the ﬁrmware version number string to IrradiateHue,
which could not possibly cause any harm. However, a real
attacker could permanently brick all the infected lamps by
simply disabling their ﬁrmware update process. Such lamps
cannot be rescued, and have to be thrown away.
Our new attack differs from previous attacks on IoT
systems in several crucial ways. First of all, previous attacks
used TCP/IP packets to scan the internet for vulnerable IoT
devices and to force them to participate in internet-based
activities such as a massive DDOS attack. Since internet
communication is heavily monitored and can be protected
by a large variety of security tools, such attacks can be
discovered and stopped at an early stage, at least in principle.
Our attack does not use any internet communication at all,
and the infections jump directly from lamp to lamp using
only unmonitored and unprotected ZigBee communication.
Consequently, it will be very difﬁcult to detect that an attack
is taking place and to locate its source after the whole light-
ing system is disabled. Another major difference is that our
attack spreads via physical proximity alone, disregarding the
established networking structures of lamps and controllers.
As a result, such an attack cannot be stopped by isolating
various subnetworks from each other, as system adminis-
trators often do when they are under attack. In this sense
the attack is similar to air-borne biological infections such
as inﬂuenza, which spread almost exclusively via physical
proximity. Finally, previously reported attacks are carried
out via linear scans and infections which are all carried out
in a star-shaped structure with a centrally located attacker,
whereas our chain reaction attack spreads much faster by
making each infected lamp the new source of infection for
all its adjacent lamps; the attacker only has to initiate the
infecting with a single bad lamp, and can then retire and
watch the whole city going dark automatically.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes
related work on the security of smart lamps, presents an
overview of our attack, and analyzes how many smart lamps
are needed in order to cause a widespread infection in a
typical city. Section 3 provides the necessary background
for the attack: ﬁrst we describe the ZigBee Light Link
(ZLL) standard which is used by the Philips Hue bulbs,
and then we describe the features targeted in this attack
such as the commissioning and upgrade process. In addition,
we summarize the cryptographic primitives and the side-
channel attacks we will be using against them. Section 4
describes the physical hardware setup, along with the results
of a preliminary power analysis attack against the hardware.
Sections 5, 6, and 7 describe the technical details of the
attack. Section 5 provides details of the upgrade process
and how it relates to spreading a worm, assuming that the
correct encryption keys could be found to disseminate a
valid encrypted and signed ﬁrmware ﬁle. Section 6 describes

a novel power analysis which can recover the encryption
keys (and other associated secret information such as the
I.V.) from the AES-CCM encryption scheme, that requires
less than twice the effort required to break the much simpler
AES-ECB scheme. With encryption keys known, in Section
7 we solve the problem of taking control of a device at very
long ranges, which allows us to feed a device the ‘updated’
ﬁrmware image which we have encrypted & signed with
the recovered keys. Section 8 provides some examples of
what this worm could accomplish, and then we conclude
the paper in Section 9.
2. Attacks on Smart lamps
2.1. Related Work
In recent years numerous works on the security of IoT
devices and protocols were published. Regarding connected
lamps, several vulnerabilities were discovered. Alex Chap-
man [2] managed to extract hard coded encryption keys
used to encrypt data sent between LIFX brand light bulbs.
From this he recovered the Wi-Fi password of the local
network that was sent between the bulbs. Dhanjani [3] had
shown DoS (denial of service) attacks against Philips Hue.
Ronen and Shamir [4] have shown how to use the Philips
Hue and LimitlessLed systems to create a covert channel
to exﬁltrate data from air-gapped networks, and to create
strobes that can cause epileptic seizures. Heiland [5] found
weaknesses in the Osram Lightify app such as unencrypted
Wi-Fi passwords,
lack of authentication in the gateway
and vulnerable usage of ZigBee Home Automation proﬁle.
However those vulnerabilities are not related to the ZLL
(ZigBee Light Link) protocol discussed in this paper.
There are several works speciﬁc to the ZLL protocol and
related products. Armknecht et al. [6] proposed a formal se-
curity model. Zillner [7] and Morgner et al. [8] demonstrated
weaknesses in ZLL and ways to take over lamps. However to
be able to take over lamps from a distance they had to use
custom hardware with much stronger transmission power.
O’Flynn [9] reverse engineered some of the Philips Hue
security design choices, where he raised the possibility of
a lightbulb worm, but did not bypass either the ﬁrmware
security protection or provide a spreading mechanism.
A different type of worm which spreads through Blue-
tooth enabled cellular phones, was described by Carettoni et
al. [10]. ]. It spreads when the cellular phones temporarily
pass by each other, without exploiting any novel vulnerabil-
ity. Our attack on stationary IoT devices exploits previously
unknown weaknesses in the implementation of the Zigbee
protocol.
The ﬁrst power analysis attacks on Atmel AES hard-
ware accelerators was done by Kizhvatov [11] against
the Atmel XMEGA using AES-ECB mode. O’Flynn and
Chen [12] used the same leakage model to attack the At-
mel MegaRF128RFA1 hardware, and attacked the ZigBee
CCM* mode of operation under the assumption of a known
nonce. Jaffe [13] had shown an attack on counter mode
encryption with unknown nonce, but would require 216
sequential block operations on our hardware with the same
nonce while our ﬁrmware can have at most 214 traces.
Moreover, modifying the method by which the counter
updates (using a linear feedback shift register, for example)
would present a serious challenge to his attack.
2.2. Overview of Our Attack
Our attack is much stronger than all of the previ-
ously described attacks since it creates the ﬁrst native and
autonomously self spreading ZigBee worm, targeting the
Philips Hue light system. It is a combination of two novel
attacks:
1) A Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) attack against the
CCM mode used to encrypt and verify ﬁrmware up-
dates, allowing us to encrypt, sign and upload malicious
OTA updates to infect lamps.
2) A takeover attack allowing us to take full control
over lamps from long distances without using custom
hardware.
Our novel takeover attack uses a bug in Atmel’s im-
plementation of the ZLL Touchlink protocol state machine
(used in Philips Hue lamps) to take over lamps from large
