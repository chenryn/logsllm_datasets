I am currently using the WinAppDbg framework to develop a debugger in Python. I can set breakpoints using the `event.debug.break_at(event.get_pid(), address)` function. However, after setting certain breakpoints (not during the setting process, but when the program hits them), I encounter an access violation exception.

For example, I can set breakpoints at addresses 0x48D1EA or 0x47A001 without any issues. But if I set a breakpoint at 0x408020, I get the following exception:

```
0048D0BE: xor esi, eax
0048D0C0: call [winamp!start+0x25c1]
760DCC50: add [ebx], dh
Access Violation
Exception event (00000001) at address 779315DE, process 9172, thread 9616
```

The base address of the module is 0x400000. I am taking the addresses for the breakpoints from a PIDA file generated by IDA, and I have rebased the file so that the addresses should be correctly aligned.

Upon further investigation, it appears that the `pida_dump` script did not use the correct base address. When I rebased the file, the calculation was as follows:

```
new_address = old_address - old_base_address + new_base_address
```

Since the `old_base_address` was incorrect, the calculated addresses for the breakpoints were also incorrect, leading to the access violation exceptions.

Thank you for your help!
