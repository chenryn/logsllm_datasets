To effectively implement CIS Control 15.7, which focuses on securely decommissioning service providers, an organization should follow these key procedures:

1. **User and Service Account Deactivation:**
   - Ensure that all user and service accounts associated with the service provider are deactivated or removed. This includes revoking any access privileges and updating access control lists.

2. **Termination of Data Flows:**
   - Identify and terminate all data flows between the organization and the service provider. This involves disabling or removing any network connections, APIs, or other integration points that facilitate data exchange.

3. **Secure Disposal of Enterprise Data:**
   - Verify that all enterprise data stored within the service provider's systems is securely disposed of. This may involve requesting a certificate of destruction from the service provider, ensuring data is wiped in accordance with industry standards (e.g., NIST SP 800-88), and confirming that no copies of the data remain.

4. **Documentation and Audit:**
   - Maintain thorough documentation of the decommissioning process, including steps taken, dates, and responsible parties. Conduct a final audit to ensure that all decommissioning activities have been completed and that no residual data or access remains.

CIS Control 15.7 falls under the asset type "Data" and is part of the "Protect" security function. By following these procedures, organizations can ensure that their data remains secure and that there are no lingering vulnerabilities after the service provider relationship ends.
