All the Feels
Separate Feelings from States of Being
"I AM so lonely [and no one will ever love me]." 
"I FEEL lonely right now, but I could talk to a friend."
"I AM a mess [and I could not change even if I wanted to]."
"I FEEL heartbroken and exhausted and furious and overwhelmed right 
now, but I didn't always feel this way in the past, and I won't always 
feel this way in the future. 
I can't change what happened, but I can change how I feel about it."
All the Feels
"I am so burnt out." 
"I feel exhausted from working all the time and going home just 
stresses me out more."
"I feel exhausted from working all the time and angry that I have to be on call 24/7 just to get an 
ounce of recognition from my boss, and the attitude I take home isn't making my family life any 
better. And this new guy at work is eyeing my stapler, that bastard."
"That new guy seems pretty good, and I'm terrified he's going to replace me if I can't prove to 
everyone that I'm on his level. But what if I try to learn the new stuff, I'll find out I'm not as fast at it as 
I used to be? I'm afraid to tell my family how anxious I feel, because I'm their rock and I don't want to 
disappoint them. I've been shutting them out, and now I feel guilty that it's gone on for so long that I 
can't bring it up and admit this is all my fault. I think about home when I'm at work, and work when 
I'm at home, and get nothing constructive done at either."

You!
Talking to someone trusted who is educated about suicide intervention can 
save a life. If possible, talk in person. While implementing QPR, you can 
research alternate referral options and help get the PIC to a safe space. 
911
If you think/know an attempt is in progress, call Emergency Services 
immediately.
Current or Past Therapist
Professionals with knowledge of the PIC's medical / psychological history are 
invaluable. Past therapists can help make quality referrals (e.g. after a move or 
due to insurance change). If the PIC won't make the call, you can.
Hospital / Counseling Center
Making the physical move to safe environment drastically lowers mortality risk.
