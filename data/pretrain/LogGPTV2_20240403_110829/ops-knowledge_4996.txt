Question: "Consider an Android device that allows users to set their own root of trust for the purpose of installing custom versions of Android. If this feature is implemented, what security precautions must be in place to maintain the integrity and safety of the device's boot process?"
 "A": "The user-settable root of trust can be set remotely by the manufacturer to ensure only authorized versions of Android are installed."
 "B": "Physical confirmation is required to set or clear the user-settable root of trust, and it must be stored in tamper-evident storage."
 "C": "The device should boot any version of Android without validation once a user-settable root of trust is configured."
 "D": "User notification is not necessary when the device boots using the user-settable root of trust since the integrity is already ensured by the user's configuration."
Answer: B
