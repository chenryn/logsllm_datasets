# RTU (PLC) Controls
RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) or PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) controls can be managed by a single computer in smaller installations, or by multiple servers in redundant clusters for larger installations. Both Master Stations and HMIs (Human-Machine Interfaces) are now supported on all major operating system platforms, including UNIX, Windows, and VMS.

## SCADA Basics
### Components of a SCADA Network – Management Layer
- **Human-Machine Interface (HMI)**: The HMI is the interface that presents process data to human operators and allows them to control the process. It provides a standardized method to monitor and control multiple remote controllers, PLCs, and other control devices, which are often distributed in a way that makes manual data collection challenging.
- **Mimic Diagram**: This is a schematic representation of the plant being controlled. For example, a picture of a pump connected to a pipe can show the operator the current status of the pump and the flow rate. The operator can then use the HMI to switch the pump on or off.

### Components of a SCADA Network – Communications Layer
- **Traditional Communication Methods**: Historically, SCADA systems used a mix of radio, direct serial, and modem connections. Equipment often communicated using proprietary protocols over RS-485 (multipoint serial connection).
- **Proprietary Limitations**: This approach limited upgrade paths for those who invested in specific hardware solutions.
- **Open Protocols**: To address these limitations, open communication protocols such as DNP3.0 (over serial or IP) became popular. Open architecture SCADA systems allow for a mix-and-match approach with different vendors' hardware.
- **Modern Protocols**: In the 2000s, protocols like Modbus/IP enabled more open interfacing, allowing for greater flexibility and interoperability.

### SCADA Network Protocols
- **Raw Data Protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3)**: These protocols are primarily used for serial radio links but can also run over TCP/IP. They read data (e.g., voltage, fluid flow) and send commands (e.g., flip switches, start pumps) and alerts (e.g., "it's broken!").
- **High-Level Data Protocols (e.g., ICCP, OCP)**: OLE for Process Control (OCP) is used for intercommunication between heterogeneous hardware and software combinations, facilitating data and command exchange between applications and databases. These protocols often bridge office and control networks.

### The Operator
The role of the operator is crucial in SCADA systems. Operators use HMIs to monitor and control the processes, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

### SCADA Networks – Past and Present
- **Past**: Early SCADA systems were considered "primitive" compared to modern networks. They used proprietary hardware and software, with limited availability of manuals and procedures. Closed systems were thought to be immune to outside threats.
- **Present**: Modern SCADA networks are interconnected with utility networks, corporate networks, and the internet. Protocols like DNP3 over TCP/IP are common. However, this interconnectivity makes them susceptible to modern cyber-attacks, such as SYN Flood and Ping of Death.

### SCADA Security Vulnerabilities
- **Wonderware SuiteLink Denial of Service Vulnerability**: A significant portion of industrial plants use Wonderware software. A vulnerability was discovered where a malformed packet could cause a memory allocation failure, leading to a service termination.
- **CitectSCADA ODBC Service Vulnerability**: Citect, a subsidiary of Schneider Electric, faced a vulnerability in its ODBC service. This allowed for arbitrary code execution due to a lack of proper length checking, enabling buffer overflow attacks.

### Research and Publications
- **Recent Research**: Numerous studies and presentations have highlighted SCADA security issues. Examples include BlackHat Federal 2006, Hack in the Box 2007, and Defcon 2007.
- **Reasons for Concern**: The potential consequences of a SCADA compromise are tangible, making it a critical area for cybersecurity. Cyber-enabled terrorism is a growing concern.

### SCADA Security Testing
- **Testing Tools**: You can test SCADA network security using existing knowledge and tools available online. Custom tools are not always necessary; standard tools like Sulley Fuzzer and Modscan can be used.
- **Required Knowledge**: Familiarity with 802.11/a/b/g, VoIP, Windows, Unix, SMB, SQL, and intelligence gathering techniques is essential.

### Intelligence Gathering
- **Radio Frequency Scanning**: Modern programmable scanners can store and scan thousands of frequencies, often used to monitor emergency services. Free software packages can decode various data protocols.
- **SCADA Messages Over Radio**: Many SCADA messages and alerts are sent over radio links, which can leak information in clear text, making them accessible to anyone with a scanner.
- **IVR SCADA Control Systems**: Systems like SCADAlarm provide remote access via telephone networks, which can be exploited through caller ID spoofing.
- **War-Dialing**: This technique involves dialing large blocks of numbers to identify and enumerate systems. Free software solutions like Tone-Loc and THC Scan are available for this purpose.

### Conclusion
SCADA systems are evolving from proprietary, isolated systems to more standard, documented, and interconnected ones. This shift brings new security challenges, making it crucial to stay informed and vigilant about potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
