F FAST CONFIRMATION FOR HONEST TRANSACTIONS: PROOF OF
THEOREM 4.7
ℓ
This section uses ideas from the proof of Lemma D.6. Let the transaction tx enters the system15 in round r and
let ℓ be the last level on the proposer blocktree which has proposer blocks at round r. Define
the honest users mined the first proposer block on level ˜ℓ(cid:1)
∗ := max(cid:0) ˜ℓ ≤ ℓ s.t
Let r∗ be the round in which the first proposer block was mined on level ℓ∗. From the definition of ℓ∗ we have
the following two observations:
(1) All the proposer blocks on levels greater or equal to ℓ∗ are mined on or after round r∗ because by
definition there are no proposer blocks on level ℓ∗ before round r∗ and hence no user can mine a
proposer block on a level greater than ℓ∗ before round r∗.
. For rf ≥ r, let us define the following event:
∗
, rf − ∆0] − Zp[r
(2) The adversary has mined at least one proposer block on all levels in [ℓ∗, ℓ].

Lemma F.1. If event Arf occurs, then the transactions tx is included in a block b which is proposed in round
r(b) ≤ rf − ∆0 and confirmed as a leader block by round rf .
Proof. From our first observation, Y p[r∗, rf − ∆0] > Zp[r∗, rf ] implies that by round rf there exists a level
˜l ≥ ℓ∗ which has only one honest proposer block proposed in interval [r∗, rf − ∆0]. Our second observation
says that the adversary has mined a proposer block on all levels in [ℓ∗, ℓ] and therefore, we have ˜ℓ > ℓ. From
Lemma E.9, the single proposer block at level ˜ℓ is confirmed as a final leader block of its level w.p 1 − εm by
round rf . Since this proposer block was mined after round r, it will include the transaction tx.

Let us define the following random variable:
Rf := min rf ≥ r s.t Arf
occurs.

Zp[r∗, rf − ∆0] d= Wrf − V in distribution. Therefore, event Arf
implies Wrf > V and we have
Rf = min rf ≥ r s.t Wrf > V occurs.
The random walk Wrf
has a positive drift of (1−2β) ¯fv

From Lemma F.1 and F.2, we conclude that a transaction, which is part of a transaction block mined in round
r, is referred by a proposer block at level (say) ℓ and the leader block at this level confirmed before round
