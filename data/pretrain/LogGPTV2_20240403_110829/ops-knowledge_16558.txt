Question: Consider a scenario where an individual is attempting to access password-protected data on a device with a Secure Storage Component. As a cybersecurity specialist, identify the sequence of events and the security measures that are triggered when incorrect passcode attempts are made.
"A": "The counter is incremented with each incorrect attempt and if the maximum is reached, the Secure Storage Component erases the counter lockbox.",
"B": "The counter is decremented with each incorrect attempt and if zero is reached, the Secure Storage Component locks the device permanently.",
"C": "The Secure Storage Component attempts to derive the passcode verifier value and lockbox entropy value using the algorithm that created the counter lockbox.",
"D": "Once the maximum attempt count is reached, the Secure Storage Component disables Face ID and Touch ID as part of the anti-replay services."
