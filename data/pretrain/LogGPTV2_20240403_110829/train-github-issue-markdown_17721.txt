I've been trying to dynamically check and uncheck the Table Header checkbox
through another component, and have been unable to do so.
While exploring this issue further I found that in the TableHeader component
setting selectAllSelected to true doesn't seem to be passed on. I've added
dummy props to my table header just to verify I was looking at the right
information, and console.logged the props in willMount and render. The
selectAllSelected seems to default to false.
