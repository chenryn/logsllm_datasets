I have been attempting to dynamically check and uncheck the Table Header checkbox from another component, but I have not been successful. Upon further investigation, I discovered that in the `TableHeader` component, setting the `selectAllSelected` prop to `true` does not seem to be properly passed through. To verify that I was inspecting the correct information, I added dummy props to the table header and logged the props in both the `componentWillMount` (or `UNSAFE_componentWillMount` if using a newer React version) and `render` methods. The `selectAllSelected` prop appears to default to `false`, even when it is explicitly set to `true`.

For clarity, hereâ€™s a more structured breakdown of the issue:

1. **Objective**: Dynamically control the state of the Table Header checkbox from another component.
2. **Issue**: Setting `selectAllSelected` to `true` in the `TableHeader` component does not reflect the change.
3. **Verification**:
   - Added dummy props to the `TableHeader` component.
   - Logged the props in the `componentWillMount` and `render` lifecycle methods.
   - Observed that `selectAllSelected` defaults to `false` despite being set to `true`.

This suggests that there might be an issue with how the `selectAllSelected` prop is being handled or passed to the `TableHeader` component.
