Question: A device manufacturer is preparing to launch a new Android device and wants to ensure it uses file-based encryption (FBE) securely. What are the kernel support requirements that the manufacturer must meet, and why are these requirements critical for the secure implementation of FBE?
"A": "Kernel support for Ext4 and F2FS encryption with version 3.18 or higher is required, as this support facilitates the necessary encryption capabilities within the kernel.",
"B": "Kernel support for inline encryption hardware is optional but recommended, as it can improve performance and reduce power usage during encryption and decryption processes.",
"C": "Kernel version 5.1 or higher is mandatory for all Android devices, as older versions do not support the cryptographic acceleration needed for FBE.",
"D": "Kernel support for ARMv8 CE (Cryptography Extensions) acceleration is discouraged, as it can potentially introduce security vulnerabilities in the encryption process."
Answer: AB
