**Additional Information**  
This maybe unrelated to electron but I spend some days searching for this
issue and electron seems to be the common factor for me, so I'm opening this
issue for others having the same / similar problems.
The GPU acceleration of chromium seems to trigger the problem, but it maybe
related to the driver / hardware.
