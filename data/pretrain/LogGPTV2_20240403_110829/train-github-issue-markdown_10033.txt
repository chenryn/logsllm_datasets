For example, let us say, there is an already formed web page and for example
there is a section with product description, that doesn't use any classes of
the web page due to `reset.css v 2.0` and for example it would be great to
apply `bootstrap.css` to this section specifically.
Maybe it will be possible in future versions or there is a distinct no to
that?
