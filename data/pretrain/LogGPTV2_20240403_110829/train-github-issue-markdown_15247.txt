It seems the `debug!` code isn't properly pushing a span onto the macro
expansion span stack. This code:
    fn main() {
        let a = ~"";
        debug!("foo: %s %s", a);
    }
Only reports the error inside the macro, but not where that macro is getting
used:
    :33:24: 33:42 error: not enough arguments to fmt! for the given format string
    :33             __log(4u32, fmt!( $($arg),+ ))
                                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
