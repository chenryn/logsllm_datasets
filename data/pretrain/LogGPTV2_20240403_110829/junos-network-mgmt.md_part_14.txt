IEEE 802.3ah OAM Link-Fault Management Overview
Ethernet interfaces capable of running at 100 Mbps or faster on EX Series switches, PTX Series, MX
Series, M Series (except M5 and M10 routers), and T Series routers support the IEEE 802.3ah standard
for Operation, Administration, and Management (OAM). You can configure IEEE 802.3ah OAM on
Ethernet point-to-point direct links or links across Ethernet repeaters. The IEEE 802.3ah standard meets
the requirement for OAM capabilities as Ethernet moves from being solely an enterprise technology to
being a WAN and access technology, as well as being backward-compatible with existing Ethernet
technology. Junos OS supports IEEE 802.3ah link-fault management.
The features of link-fault management are:
133
• Discovery
• Link monitoring
• Remote fault detection
• Remote loopback
Starting in Junos OS Release 17.3R1, the Ethernet link fault management daemon (lfmd) runs on the
backup Routing Engine as well when graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES) is configured.
The following features are not supported:
• Ethernet running on top of a Layer 2 protocol, such as Ethernet over ATM, is not supported in OAM
configurations.
• Remote loopback is not supported on the 10-Gigabit Ethernet LAN/WAN PIC with SFP+.
• The remote loopback feature mentioned in section 57.2.11 of IEEE 802.3ah is not supported on
T4000 routers.
NOTE: Aggregated Ethernet member links will now use the physical MAC address as the source
MAC address in 802.3ah OAM packets.
Understanding Ethernet OAM Link Fault Management for ACX Series Routers
The Juniper Networks Junos operating system (Junos OS) for Juniper Networks ACX Series routers
allows the Ethernet interfaces on these routers to support the IEEE 802.3ah standard for the Operation,
Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) of Ethernet in access networks. The standard defines OAM link
fault management (LFM). You can configure IEEE 802.3ah OAM LFM on point-to-point Ethernet links
that are connected either directly or through Ethernet repeaters. The IEEE 802.3ah standard meets the
requirement for OAM capabilities even as Ethernet moves from being solely an enterprise technology to
a WAN and access technology, and the standard remains backward compatible with the existing
Ethernet technology.
Ethernet OAM provides tools that network management software and network managers can use to
determine how a network of Ethernet links is functioning. Ethernet OAM should:
• Rely only on the media access control (MAC) address or virtual LAN identifier for troubleshooting.
• Work independently of the actual Ethernet transport and function over physical Ethernet ports or a
virtual service such as a pseudowire.
• Isolate faults over a flat (or single-operator) network architecture or nested or hierarchical (or
multiprovider) networks.
134
The following OAM LFM features are supported on ACX Series routers:
• Discovery and Link Monitoring
The discovery process is triggered automatically when OAM is enabled on the interface. The
discovery process permits Ethernet interfaces to discover and monitor the peer on the link if it also
supports the IEEE 802.3ah standard. You can specify the discovery mode used for IEEE 802.3ah
OAM support. In active mode, the interface discovers and monitors the peer on the link if the peer
also supports IEEE 802.3ah OAM functionality. In passive mode, the peer initiates the discovery
process. After the discovery process has been initiated, both sides participate in the process. The
router performs link monitoring by sending periodic OAM protocol data units (PDUs) to advertise
OAM mode, configuration, and capabilities.
You can specify the number of OAM PDUs that an interface can skip before the link between peers is
considered down.
• Remote Fault Detection
Remote fault detection uses flags and events. Flags are used to convey the following:
• Link Fault means a loss of signal
• Dying Gasp means an unrecoverable condition such as a power failure. In this condition, the local
peer informs the remote peer about the failure state. When the remote peer receives a dying-
gasp PDU, it takes an action corresponding to the action profile configured with the link-
adjacency-loss event.
NOTE: ACX5096 and ACX5048 routers do not support dying-gasp.
When LFM is configured on an interface, a dying-gasp PDU is generated for the interface on the
following failure conditions:
• Power failure
• Packet Forwarding Engine panic or a crash
• Critical Event means an unspecified vendor-specific critical event.
You can specify the interval at which OAM PDUs are sent for fault detection.
NOTE: ACX Series routers support the receipt of dying-gasp packets, but cannot generate
them.
• Remote Loopback Mode
135
Remote loopback mode ensures link quality between the router and a remote peer during installation
or troubleshooting. In this mode, when the interface receives a frame that is not an OAM PDU or a
PAUSE frame, it sends it back on the same interface on which it was received. The link appears to be
in the active state. You can use the returned loopback acknowledgement to test delay, jitter, and
throughput.
If a remote data terminal equipment (DTE) supports remote loopback mode, Junos OS can place the
remote DTE into loopback mode. When you place a remote DTE into loopback mode, the interface
receives the remote loopback request and puts the interface into remote loopback mode. When the
interface is in remote loopback mode, all frames except OAM PDUs and PAUSE frames are looped
back. No changes are made to the frames. OAM PDUs continue to be sent and processed.
Configuring Ethernet 802.3ah OAM
The IEEE 802.3ah standard for Operation, Administration, and Management (OAM) provides a
specification for Ethernet in the first mile (EFM) connectivity. EFM defines how Ethernet can be
transmitted over new media types using new Ethernet physical layer (PHY) interfaces. You can configure
IEEE 802.3ah OAM on Ethernet point-to-point direct links or links across Ethernet repeaters. The IEEE
802.3ah OAM standard meets the requirement for OAM capabilities as Ethernet moves from being
solely an enterprise technology to being a WAN and access technology, as well as being backward-
compatible with existing Ethernet technology.
For Ethernet interfaces capable of running at 100 Mbps or faster, the IEEE 802.3ah OAM standard is
supported on numerous Juniper Networks routers and switches. This topic describes configuration
support for IEEE 802.3ah OAM features on routers.
Beginning in Junos OS Release 12.1, PTX Series routers support the following IEEE 802.3ah OAM
features at the physical interface level:
• Discovery and link monitoring
• Fault signaling and detection
• Periodic packet management (PPM) processing
• Action profile support
• Graceful Routing Engine switchover (GRES)
To configure 802.3ah OAM support for Ethernet interfaces, include the oam statement at the [edit
protocols] hierarchy level:
oam {
ethernet {
link-fault-management {
interfaces {
136
interface-name {
pdu-interval interval;
link-discovery (active | passive);
pdu-threshold count;
}
}
}
}
}
You can configure threshold values for fault events that trigger the sending of link event TLVs when the
values exceed the threshold. To set threshold values for fault events on an interface, include the event-
thresholds statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management interface] hierarchy level.
You can also configure OAM threshold values within an action profile and apply the action profile to
multiple interfaces. To create an action profile, include the action-profile statement at the [edit protocols
oam ethernet link-fault-management] hierarchy level.
You can configure Ethernet OAM either on an aggregate interface or on each of its member links.
However, we recommend that you configure Ethernet OAM on the aggregate interface, and this will
internally enable Ethernet OAM on the member links.
To view OAM statistics, use the show oam ethernet link-fault-management operational mode command. To
clear OAM statistics, use the clear oam ethernet link-fault-management statistics operational mode
command. To clear link-fault management state information and restart the link discovery process on
Ethernet interfaces, use the clear oam ethernet link-fault-management state operational mode command. For
more information about these commands, see the CLI Explorer.
To enable IEEE 802.3ah OAM support, include the interface statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet
link-fault-management] hierarchy level:
[edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
When you enable IEEE 802.3ah OAM on a physical interface, the discovery process is automatically
triggered.

only when the link-fault-management protocol is configured.
138
Configuring Link Discovery
When the IEEE 802.3ah OAM protocol is enabled on a physical interface, the discovery process is
automatically triggered. The discovery process permits Ethernet interfaces to discover and monitor the
peer on the link if it also supports the IEEE 802.3ah standard.
You can specify the discovery mode used for IEEE 802.3ah OAM support. The discovery process is
triggered automatically when OAM IEEE 802.3ah functionality is enabled on a port. Link monitoring is
done when the interface sends periodic OAM PDUs.
To configure the discovery mode, include the link-discovery statement at the [edit protocol oam ethernet
link-fault-management interface interface-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
link-discovery (active | passive);
In active mode, the interface discovers and monitors the peer on the link if the peer also supports IEEE
802.3ah OAM functionality. In passive mode, the peer initiates the discovery process. After the
discovery process has been initiated, both sides participate in discovery.

link-discovery
Configuring the OAM PDU Interval
Periodic OAM PDUs are sent to perform link monitoring.
You can specify the periodic OAM PDU sending interval for fault detection.
To configure the sending interval, include the pdu-interval statement at the [edit protocol oam ethernet link-
fault-management interface interface-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
pdu-interval interval;
The periodic OAM PDU interval range is from 100 through 1000 milliseconds. The default sending
interval is 1000 milliseconds.

pdu-interval
Configuring the OAM PDU Threshold
You can specify the number of OAM PDUs that an interface can miss before the link between peers is
considered down.
To configure the number of PDUs that can be missed from the peer, include the pdu-threshold statement
at the [edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
pdu-threshold threshold-value;
The threshold value range is from 3 through 10. The default is three PDUs.
SEE ALSO
pdu-threshold
Configuring Threshold Values for Local Fault Events on an Interface
You can configure threshold values on an interface for the local errors that trigger the sending of link
event TLVs.
To set the error threshold values for sending event TLVs, include the frame-error, frame-period, frame-period-
summary, and symbol-period statements at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management interface
interface-name event-thresholds] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name]
event-thresholds {
frame-error count;
frame-period count;
frame-period-summary count;
symbol-period count;
}

Disabling the Sending of Link Event TLVs
You can disable the sending of link event TLVs.
To disable the monitoring and sending of PDUs containing link event TLVs in periodic PDUs, include the
no-allow-link-events statement at the [edit protocols oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-
name negotiation-options] hierarchy level:
[edit protocol oam ethernet link-fault-management interface interface-name negotiation-options]
no-allow-link-events;
