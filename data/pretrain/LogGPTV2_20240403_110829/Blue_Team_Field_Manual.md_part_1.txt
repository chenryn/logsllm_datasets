## 1. Identify (Scope and Inventory)
### 1.1 Scanning for Vulnerabilities
#### NMAP
- Pinging a network:
  ```bash
  nmap -sn <network>
  ```
- Scanning and showing open ports:
  ```bash
  nmap <target>
  ```
- Determining services:
  ```bash
  nmap -sV <target>
  ```
- Scanning common TCP ports (HTTP, HTTPS):
  ```bash
  nmap -p 80,443 <target>
  ```
- Scanning UDP ports (DNS):
  ```bash
  nmap -sU -p 53 <target>
  ```
- Scanning and getting version, OS, and single host including scripting:
  ```bash
  nmap -v -Pn -sS -sU -T4 -O -F --script=vuln <target>
  ```

#### NESSUS
- Basic scan:
  ```bash
  nessuscli scan --policy <policy_name> --targets <target_list> --output <output_file>.html
  ```
- Batch scanning:
  ```bash
  nessuscli scan --policy <policy_name> --targets <target_list> --output <output_file>.html
  ```
- Report conversion:
  ```bash
  nessuscli report --input <input_file>.nessus --output <output_file>.html
  ```

#### OPENVAS
- Step 1: Install server and plugin packages:
  ```bash
  apt-get install openvas-scanner openvas-server openvas-client openvas-plugins-dfsg
  ```
- Step 2: Update vulnerability database:
  ```bash
  openvas-nvt-sync
  ```
- Step 3: Add a new user:
  ```bash
  openvas-adduser
  ```
- Step 4: Log in as admin:
  ```bash
  gvm-cli --gmp-username admin --gmp-password <password>
  ```
