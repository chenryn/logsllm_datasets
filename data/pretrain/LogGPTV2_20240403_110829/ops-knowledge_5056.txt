User: Please explain the database design paradigm, explaining 1NF, 2NF and 3NF respectively.
Assistant: The database design paradigm is a standard used to standardize the database structure, mainly used to avoid data redundancy and data loss problems. Commonly used paradigms are 1NF, 2NF and 3NF. 1NF: The first normal form requires that all data cannot be split, that is, each attribute should be atomic. It is the basis of database design, and any database should meet the requirements of first normal form. 2NF: The second normal form requires that on the basis of satisfying 1NF, non-primary key columns must be completely dependent on the primary key. That is, if there are multiple candidate keys in the table, all non-primary key columns on each candidate key must be fully dependent on that candidate key. 3NF: The third normal form requires that on the basis of 2NF, any non-primary key columns do not depend on other non-primary key columns. That is, each non-primary key column depends only on the primary key and not on other non-primary key columns. Generally speaking, a database structure conforming to the third normal form can guarantee the consistency, integrity and reliability of the data. However, sometimes in order to improve query efficiency, the paradigm requirement may be lowered and some data may be redundant. This requires weighing the pros and cons and making appropriate adjustments based on actual needs.
