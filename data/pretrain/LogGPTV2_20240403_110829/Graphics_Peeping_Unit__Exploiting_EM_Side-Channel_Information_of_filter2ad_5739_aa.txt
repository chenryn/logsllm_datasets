Abstract—As the popularity of graphics processing units
(GPUs) grows rapidly in recent years, it becomes very critical
to study and understand the security implications imposed by
them. In this paper, we show that modern GPUs can “broadcast”
sensitive information over the air to make a number of attacks
practical. Speciﬁcally, we present a new electromagnetic (EM)
side-channel vulnerability that we have discovered in many GPUs
of both NVIDIA and AMD. We show that this vulnerability can
be exploited to mount realistic attacks through two case studies,
which are website ﬁngerprinting and keystroke timing inference
attacks. Our investigation recognizes the commonly used dynamic
voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) feature in GPU as the
root cause of this vulnerability. Nevertheless, we also show that
simply disabling DVFS may not be an effective countermeasure
since it will introduce another highly exploitable EM side-channel
vulnerability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work
that studies realistic physical side-channel attacks on non-shared
GPUs at a distance.
I. INTRODUCTION
Over the past few years, graphics processing units (GPUs)
have become an integral part of modern computer systems,
which are used not only for graphics rendering but also for
intensive parallel computing. Given the fact that many tasks
running on a GPU operate on sensitive information, concerns
about the security of GPUs, especially potential information
leakage, have been raised. Several recently developed attacks
on GPU have justiﬁed such concerns [11], [20], [21], [27],
[30], [33], [41], [47], [65].
Although these existing GPU attacks focus on different
application scenarios, they all require that GPUs be either
logically shared with or physically accessible1 to adversaries.
If an attacker has no physical or logical access to the GPUs
used by her targets, is it still possible that the attacker can
steal sensitive information from such GPUs? In this paper, we
answer this question afﬁrmatively by presenting a new physical
side-channel vulnerability of modern GPUs as well as some
examples of its exploitation.
Speciﬁcally, we have discovered certain electromagnetic
(EM) emanations2 from GPUs which are: 1 exploitable –
we ﬁnd that these EM signals are computation-dependent and
can reveal ﬁne-grained information about the ongoing activity;
and 2 easy to measure – we ﬁnd that such EM signals are
strong and can propagate very far (e.g., more than 6 meters in
1In [11], although contactless, the attack needs to remove GPU’s heat sink
and place a probe near GPU chip surface. In [30], it is the power supply of
the computer rather than the GPU that is instrumented by the attacker.
2In this paper, we use EM emanations and EM signals interchangeably.
many cases) as well as even penetrate thick walls. A further
investigation reveals that the root cause of such exploitable
far-ﬁeld EM emanations is the dynamic voltage and frequency
scaling (DVFS) feature of GPU, which has been playing an
important role in either saving energy or improving GPU
performance [1], [34], [42].
By exploiting the discovered EM side-channel information,
for the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate that it is not only possible but
also practical to mount realistic eavesdropping attacks. Given a
victim who uses a modern GPU without sharing, we show that
an attacker can spy on the victim and identify the webpages
visited by the victim (i.e., website ﬁngerprinting attack) with a
high accuracy. In addition, we show that the keystroke timings
of the victim can be further inferred, which may be used to
recover typed words or passphrases [54], [62]. As the attacker
can be several meters away from the victim and the attacker
can even hide in a separate cubicle or room, the presented
attacks are in effect extremely stealthy.
To the best of our knowledge, our work serves as the ﬁrst
physical side-channel attack on non-shared GPUs at a distance.
Prior to our work, there are only a few studies on leveraging
physical side effects of GPU computation (e.g., power [30]
or near-ﬁeld EM [11]) to breach conﬁdentiality, but all of
them require physical access to the GPUs. On the contrary, we
discover and exploit a far-ﬁeld EM side-channel vulnerability,
which empowers more practical attacks without too unrealistic
proximity requirements.
Even outside of the GPU security area, we ﬁnd that most of
the existing long-range EM-based attacks are to build covert
communication channels [16], [51], [52], [61]. Surprisingly
(or not), there are not many works showing that it is possible
to mount EM side-channel attacks on modern computers to
steal sensitive information from several meters away. This is
because EM emanations that are both far-ﬁeld and exploitable
for eavesdropping attacks appear to be hard to discover. Thus,
our work also serves as a good demonstration of long-range
EM side-channel attacks.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
• We present a new EM side-channel vulnerability that we
have discovered in modern GPUs and can be exploited to
carry out attacks at a distance and/or through a wall. We
identify the ubiquitously used DVFS as the root cause of
this side-channel and ﬁnd that such a vulnerability exists
in many GPUs of both NVIDIA and AMD.

• We formulate a signal processing framework to address
the challenges introduced by potential EM shielding and
strong noise contamination. With the proposed tech-
niques, we can exploit the EM emanations of interest even
when they are greatly attenuated or they are overwhelmed
by strong legitimate communication signals.
• We conduct two case studies on the exploitation of this
newly found EM side-channel vulnerability. The ﬁrst
one is a website ﬁngerprinting attack, and up to 93.2%
accuracy can be achieved in a scenario where the attacker
and victim are 6 meters apart. The second case study is
a keystroke timing inference attack, where we show that
keystroke events can be reliably detected to deduce inter-
keystroke times.
• We show that even though disabling GPU DVFS can be
an effective approach to mitigating the discovered EM
side-channel vulnerability, it will unfortunately introduce
another new one into many GPUs which can be exploited
to mount comparable EM side-channel attacks. We also
discuss some potential countermeasures.
As DVFS has been used or may appear in many other hardware
components [5], [8], [23], [37], [38], our research also gives
a pointer to what may need additional attention during certain
security investigations. (Note that Sehatbakhsh et al. have also
pioneered exploiting EM emanations affected by DVFS to
carry out attacks [51], and we discuss the differences between
their work and ours in Section X.)
Responsible Disclosure. We have reported our ﬁndings to
both NVIDIA and AMD. NVIDIA replied to us that “NVIDIA
is continually investigating ways to minimize board emissions
in future product designs and will take these ﬁndings and
recommendations under advisement”. AMD informed us that
their engineering team reviewed the issue and “no effective
mitigations or ﬁxes have been identiﬁed”.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we provide a brief overview of GPU archi-
tecture and GPU DVFS feature. Note that, in this paper, we do
not consider any integrated GPUs in CPU processors, namely
the term GPU is used to indicate the discrete ones designed
by NVIDIA or AMD only. Moreover, we brieﬂy present the
physical side effects exploited in this paper, namely the EM
emanations.
A. GPU Architecture
GPUs have evolved from hardwired graphics accelerators
into highly parallel programmable computing devices. Usu-
ally, a modern GPU contains a number of single-instruction
multiple-thread (SIMT) processors. Each SIMT processor has
many simple GPU cores, and each core can perform scalar
integer and ﬂoating-point arithmetic operations. Such SIMT
processors are called streaming multiprocessors by NVIDIA
and compute units by AMD. SIMT processors manage, sched-
ule, and execute groups of parallel threads, which are named
warps and wavefronts in the terminology of NVIDIA and
AMD respectively.
To store large amounts of data, a modern GPU normally
has several gigabytes of memory. Such large GPU memory
is shared by all
the SIMT processors on the GPU, and
consists of multiple memory modules. These memory modules
are of special DRAM type tailored for use in GPUs (e.g.,
GDDR5 and GDDR6). In general, a GPU needs high memory
bandwidth to sustain its high computational throughput, and
there are multiple memory controllers used to enable massively
parallel access to the memory modules to reach the desired
bandwidth. The GPU memory is independent of the main
memory on the host side and also managed in its own manner.
Data transfers between the main memory and GPU memory
are via the PCIe bus.
B. Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling
DVFS is a power management technique that has been
widely used with respect to CPUs [60]. It dynamically changes
voltage and frequency to adjust performance for power sav-
ings.3 Instead of always staying at the highest level, perfor-
mance is actively regulated according to current workloads,
which can make very efﬁcient use of energy.
As GPUs continue to grow powerful, their increasing power
consumption has become a radical problem. To address this
problem, the DVFS technique has been applied to GPUs. In
fact, almost every modern GPU provides hardware support for
DVFS [42]. For a GPU, DVFS governs the supply voltage and
frequency of both its cores and memory.
Normally, there are multiple performance levels speciﬁed
by GPU DVFS. (The performance levels are often called per-
formance/power states, namely, P-states.) Each performance
level deﬁnes a setting of voltage and frequency for the GPU
cores and memory. (At a performance level, the frequency
and/or voltage of the GPU cores may not be ﬁxed but can
vary within a speciﬁc range, while the frequency of the GPU
memory usually does not change.) GPU DVFS dynamically
switches performance levels to meet the current computation
needs and minimize power draw, heat generation, and fan
noise. In general, the approach to determining performance
levels in ofﬁcial GPU drivers is proprietary and not well-
documented. The default GPU DVFS approach is employed
automatically, although an end user may choose to disable
its functionality by manually setting ﬁxed frequencies or to
provide a customized approach [31].
C. Electromagnetic Emanations
Given the fact that electric current in the circuitry of a device
varies with time, EM emanations inevitably arise. The EM
emanations generated by a computer system are distributed
widely in the spectrum. As these EM signals generally carry
information about the underlying electronic activities, which
can be linked with certain high-level activities, some of them
have been leveraged in the context of security for attacks [2],
[12]–[14], [25], [51] as well as defenses [17], [43], [64].
3DVFS principally reduces dynamic power consumption PD, which is
proportional to the voltage V quadratically and frequency f linearly, namely,
PD ∝ V 2 × f.

Although the sources of many of the EM emanations are
unknown, a few of them are in effect easy to determine, e.g.,
emanations generated by some components whose activities
are periodic, such as voltage regulators and DRAM clocks [3].
The EM signals created by these components having periodic
switching behavior are also strong and may propagate to a
distance of several meters. Interestingly, some of these signals
may be unintentionally modulated by other activities in the
form of amplitude-modulation (AM) or frequency-modulation
(FM) [3], [48]. For example, the EM signals created by voltage
regulators may be AM-modulated by activities in the circuits
they power. Therefore, these signals act as carrier signals that
convey information about the modulating activities. Moreover,
to measure these far-ﬁeld EM signals, very simple equipment
sufﬁces. For instance, a whip antenna and a cheap software-
deﬁned radio (SDR) device are adequate [51], [64].
III. THREAT MODEL
We assume that there is an attacker who intends to eaves-
drop on a victim to extract some of his/her sensitive informa-
tion, e.g., the webpages the victim is browsing. The attacker
is in the proximity of the victim, but they may still be well
spaced apart. For example, the attacker and the victim may be
colleagues or neighbors. Furthermore, they may be physically
isolated from each other. For instance, the victim may be in
a separate cubicle, ofﬁce, or apartment, to which the attacker
has no access.
The victim uses a desktop computer system which is
equipped with a discrete GPU. (We do not consider laptops
or other mobile computing devices in this threat model.) The
GPU may be a product of either NVIDIA or AMD. We assume
that the victim uses the ofﬁcial driver and its default settings,
which is the most prevalent case in reality. The attacker is
assumed to be able to ﬁnd and employ the same type of GPU
as the one used by the victim for proﬁling. (The attacker may
have known what GPU the victim is using, but if this a priori
knowledge is not available, we will show that the attacker may
still be able to deduce it.) Unlike the prior work on GPU side-
channel or memory dump attacks [27], [33], [41], [65], we do
not require that the use of the GPU or any other computational
resources be shared between the victim and the attacker. We
neither require the presence of any software vulnerabilities.
IV. NEW EXPLOITABLE EM EMANATIONS
Given the aforementioned threat model, an attacker may opt
for EM side-channel attacks, because (1) they are passive and
non-intrusive; and (2) they may be mounted at a distance and
work through walls. Nevertheless, one challenging problem is
to ﬁnd certain exploitable EM signals which may hide in any
place of the spectrum. In this section, we present our newly
discovered, exploitable EM emanations that are generated by
the memory clock in a modern GPU.
A. EM Signal of GPU Memory Clock
First of all, we show the characteristics of the EM emana-
tions of interest. As mentioned in Section II-B, GPU DVFS
deﬁnes multiple performance levels, and it switches between
these levels in accordance with the current GPU workloads.
In other words,
the clock frequencies of the GPU cores
and memory often change. Clocks usually create strong EM
emanations, and hence when a performance level is on/off, we
expect to observe the appearance/disappearance of clear EM
signals at the corresponding clock frequencies in the spectrum.
To verify this anticipated feature, we test several AMD and
NVIDIA GPUs made by different vendors and equipped with
different types of GDDR, which are listed in Table I. These
GPUs are very commonly used, and almost all the recent
architectures of AMD and NVIDIA are covered by them,
including the latest NVIDIA Ampere architecture.
We alter the performance level of each GPU, and examine
the spectral behavior at the corresponding core and memory
frequencies. The inspection results are as follows: (1) the EM
emanations generated by the GPU core clock can be hardly
found; but, (2) the EM signal of the GPU memory clock is
very noticeable and its behavior matches our anticipation; and
(3) interestingly, the EM signal consists of many frequency
components that are over a wide range in the spectrum. For
