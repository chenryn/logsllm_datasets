**Retrieving Old Discussion from #14940:**

The feature to merge metal, roughness, and ambient occlusion (AO) textures into a single texture using different channels has been on our roadmap for the GLTFExporter since the project's inception. I had it on my backlog, but I haven't had the opportunity to work on it yet. 

I agree with @donmccurdy that this is a feature we should prioritize. Here are the proposed rules for handling these textures:

1. **Different Textures with Different Sizes:**
   - If the metal and roughness textures are different and have different sizes, use one of them and skip the other. A warning will be logged to inform the user.

2. **Different Textures with the Same Size:**
   - If the metal and roughness textures are different but have the same size, combine them into a single texture.

3. **Single Texture Present:**
   - If only one of the metal or roughness textures is present, export that texture.

4. **AO Texture with the Same Size:**
   - If the AO texture has the same size as the combined metal/roughness texture, merge the AO texture's red channel into the combined image.

Additionally, I would like to add two features to the wishlist:

1. **Option to Resize Textures:**
   - Introduce an option called `convertSizeWhenCombineTextures` that will attempt to combine textures by rescaling those with different sizes.

2. **Image Comparison for Duplicates:**
   - Implement a mechanism to compare images and detect duplicates. This could be integrated into the exporting process itself or added as a post-processing action within the GLTFExporter.Utils.

By implementing these features, we can enhance the efficiency and flexibility of the GLTFExporter, making it more robust and user-friendly.
