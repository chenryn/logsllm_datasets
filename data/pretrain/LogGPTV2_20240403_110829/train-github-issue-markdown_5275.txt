> Merging metal/rough/AO textures on the same texture on different channels is
> something we had in our plan for features to support in the GLTFExporter
> since the beginning. Actually I had it on my backlog but I have not had time
> yet to take a look at it :)  
>  So I agree with @donmccurdy on the proposal as something we should support
> soon:
> >   * If metal/rough textures are different and have different sizes, use
> one, skip the other, and log a warning.
>>
>
>   * If metal/rough textures are different and have the same size: combine
> them
>
>
>>   * If only one of metal/rough is present, export that.
>>   * If AO has the same size as the (combined) metal/rough, merge its red
channel into that image.
>>
> And I'll add to the wishlist two things:
>
>   * An option as `convertSizeWhenCombineTextures` so it will try to combine
> them by reescaling the ones with different size.
>   * Comparing images to detect duplicates. This could be added on the
> exporting process itself or as a postprocess action including it on
> GLTFEXporter.Utils
