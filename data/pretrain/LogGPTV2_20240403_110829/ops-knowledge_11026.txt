User: In Sublime, we have an easy and convent way to run Python or almost any language for that matter using ⌘ + b (or ctrl + b)
Where the code will run in a small window below the source code and can easily be closed with the escape key when no longer needed.
Is there a way to replicate this functionally with Github's atom editor?
Assistant: To run the python file on mac.

Open the preferences in atom ide. To open the preferences press 'command + . '
( ⌘ + , )
Click on the install in the preferences to install packages.
Search for package "script" and click on install
Now open the python file(with .py extension ) you want to run and press 'control + r ' (^ + r)
