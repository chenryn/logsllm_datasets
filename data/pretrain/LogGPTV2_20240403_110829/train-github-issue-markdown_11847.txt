  * Operating system: Windows 10
Hi! Here's a minimal Electron app to reproduce the bug: electron-webview-
resize-bug.zip
  1. Run the app
  2. Click the button to hide the webview
  3. Resize window
  4. Click the button again to show webview
  5. **Bug:** Notice the webview hasn't been resized (if you resize the window now then the bug disappears)

Actual use case where I hit the bug: tabbed UI with hidden ``s for
non-active tabs.

Bonus bug found while creating the testcase:
  1. Remove the `` tag in `index.html`
  2. Launch the app
  3. **Bug:** The webview doesn't show up at all.
  4. Try reloading with `Ctrl+R`, still doesn't show up
  5. Open devtools with `Ctrl+Shift+I`.
  6. Try realoding with `Ctrl+R`, notice the webview shows up.
The absence of a script / not having the devtools open seems to prevent the
webview from showing? ¯_(ツ)_/¯
