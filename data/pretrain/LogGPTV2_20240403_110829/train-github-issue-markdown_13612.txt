Not a bootstrap issue but an annoying navigation issue in
getbootstrap.com/components/
On my wide screen the height of the left menu is bigger than my screen's
height. Due to some smart scrolling, I guess, all items in the left menu which
are below my visible area are not accessible. I would not normally report an
issue like this, but this website is about CSS and should work as good as the
framework is. And it really is.
