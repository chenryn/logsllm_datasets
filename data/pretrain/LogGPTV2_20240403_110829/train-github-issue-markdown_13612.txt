The issue I'm encountering is not directly related to Bootstrap itself, but rather a navigation problem on the getbootstrap.com/components/ page. On my wide-screen display, the height of the left-hand menu exceeds the height of my screen. Due to what I assume is an intelligent scrolling feature, any items in the left menu that fall below the visible area are inaccessible. 

While I typically wouldn't report such an issue, it's particularly noteworthy here because this website is focused on CSS and should function as seamlessly as the framework it represents. The overall quality of the framework is excellent, so it would be ideal for the website to match that standard.
