### The System and Attacker's Knowledge

The attacker possesses a comprehensive understanding of the system, including the ability to extract the final features that serve as input for the machine learning algorithm. Additionally, the attacker has obtained the transactions performed by the victim in January. Using this information, the attacker replicates the same feature extraction process employed by the fraud detector.

### Attack Strategies and Performance

#### Black-Box
For the Black-Box attack, Scenario 3 is the most effective strategy for the attacker, resulting in the highest amount of money stolen. The evasion rate remains stable across all scenarios, except for the hybrid fraud detector (B5), which shows a significant decrease in performance as the fraud amount increases. In Scenario 1, the hybrid detector achieves a 100% attack detection rate, but this drops to 36% in Scenario 3. The worst-performing detector is B4, which is completely evaded in Scenario 1 and continues to be highly vulnerable in the other scenarios. Detectors B2 and B3 exhibit similar performance metrics across all scenarios.

#### Black-Box with Data
In the Black-Box with Data attack, Scenario 3 again yields the highest amount of money stolen. Detectors B1 and B5 are the most resilient, with evasion rates of 45% and 57% in Scenario 1, respectively. Other detectors show much higher evasion rates (76%-89%-99%-99%-94%). Detector B4 is easily evaded in all scenarios, with an attack detection rate of only 4% in Scenario 3. Detectors B2 and B3 continue to perform similarly across all scenarios.

#### Gray-Box
For the Gray-Box attack, Scenario 3 is also the most effective for the attacker, resulting in the highest amount of money stolen. The worst performance is observed in Scenario 2 against detector B1, with an attack detection rate of 93% and an evasion rate of 52%. Detector B5 shows a significant deterioration in performance, with an evasion rate of 90% and a detection rate of 28%. Detector B4 is easily evaded, with a 100% evasion rate in all scenarios. Detectors B2 and B3 are evaded with an average evasion rate of 85%.

#### White-Box
With full knowledge of the fraud detectors, the attacker can perform a perfect attack, achieving a 100% evasion rate and 0% attack detection rate. The worst performance is observed in Scenario 3 for model B4, leading to a loss of approximately 23 million euros. Model B6 performs much better, especially in Scenario 2. We used Oracles based on the Random Forest algorithm (O3 and O4) to attack detectors B1-B2-B3-B4 and B5, respectively. The Gray-Box experiment was not conducted on detector B6 due to the complexity of its feature set, which requires re-engineering for the Oracle to use effectively.

### Discussion on Results

Table 7 summarizes the experimental results for each evasion scenario, attacker’s knowledge, and fraud detectors. The best results from the detector's perspective are highlighted in green, while the worst results are in red.
