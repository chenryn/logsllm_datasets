the system. He or she knows how to extract the ﬁnal features
that the detector uses as input for the machine learning algo-
rithm. Also, the attacker has retrieved the transactions per-
formed by the victim in January. Then, he or she extracts the
same features used by the fraud detector; the attacker uses

Black-Box. Regarding the Black-Box attack, the best strategy
for the attacker is the one represented in Scenario 3. In fact,
except for the case in which the fraud detector is based on
Logistic Regression (B4) and BankSealer (B6), in Scenario 3
we get attack detection rate values lower than in the other two
Scenarios and much higher values in terms of money stolen.
The values of evasion rate, however, remain stable in all three
scenarios, except in the case where the attack is directed to the
hybrid fraud detector (B5). This detector achieves excellent
results in terms of evasion rate and attack detection rate in
Scenario 1, where the attack is always detected (Attack Detec-
tion Rate = 100%). The performances of this fraud detector
decrease signiﬁcantly with the increase of the amount of the
fraud; in Scenario 3, the Attack Detection Rate is reduced to
36%. The worst fraud detector is B4, which in Scenario 1 is
completely evaded. The performance of the attack against it
remains almost perfect also in the other two scenarios. Mod-
els B2 and B3 obtain similar values in all the metrics for all
the scenarios.
Black-Box with Data. Even for this type of attack, the best
strategy for the attacker is the one applied in Scenario 3, in
which the money stolen reaches the highest values. The fraud
detectors that best counteract the attack are B1 and B5. In
Scenario 1, they have an evasion rate of 45% and 57% re-
spectively, while the other detectors have values much higher
76%-89%-99%-99%-94%. Also, in this setting, the fraud de-
tector B4 is easily evaded in all three scenarios, reaching at
most an attack detection rate of 4% in Scenario 3. Models B2-
B3 continue to be similar, obtaining almost the same values
in all the scenarios.
Gray-Box. Also, for the Gray-Box attack, the best strategy
for the attacker is the one applied in Scenario 3, which obtains
the highest values in terms of money stolen. The worst perfor-
mances of the attack are obtained in Scenario 2, against fraud
detector B1, which has an attack detection rate of 93% and
an evasion rate of 52%. We note signiﬁcant deterioration in
detection performances of detector B5, which has an evasion
rate of 90% and a detection rate of 28%, values much lower
than those obtained in other settings. Detector B4 is easily
evaded, with an evasion rate of even 100% in all three scenar-
ios. As in the other settings, detectors B2-B3 are evaded with
an average evasion rate of 85%.
White-Box. Having complete knowledge of fraud detectors,
we can perform perfect attacks. We can effectively test the
robustness of each fraud detector against a perfect attacker,
which steals the maximum amount of money but is never de-
tected. By conservatively tuning the Injection Rate, we were
able to achieve 100% Evasion Rate and 0% Attack Detection
Rate against all detectors in all scenarios. The worst perfor-
mances are obtained by model B4, which in Scenario 3 leads
the bank to a loss of about 23 million euros. Much better are
the performances of detector B6 that, instead, in Scenario 2
an Oracle based on the Random Forest algorithm, which has
shown to be the best fraud detection system. We used model
O3 and O4 as Oracles for attacking respectively fraud detec-
tors B1-B2-B3-B4 and B5. We do not perform the Gray-Box
experiment on the fraud detectors B6, since the partial knowl-
edge acquired by the attacker can not be directly applied to
perform the attack. In fact, the feature used by B6 can not
be directly used by the Oracle without re-engineering them.
This is due to the fact that B6 uses a combination of statistical
and machine-learning-based detectors with ad-hoc features.
Therefore, an attacker would resort to the Black-Box attack.
White-Box. The attacker has full knowledge of the system,
including the dataset used for the training. The attacker repro-
duces the real system and uses it as Oracle so that he or she
can perform a “perfect” attack.
6.4 Discussion on Results
In Table 7, we present the results of the experimental eval-
uation against the attacks for each scenario and degree of
