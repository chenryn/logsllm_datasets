User: another question for all of you-
So i am trying to get a program called Pysomap to work (its basically ISOMAP but for python[http://web.vscht.cz/spiwokv/pysomap/]), i follow the directions best as i can, building it on Ubuntu, Windows, and Fedora (prebuilt libraries), but cant seem to get it to work. On windows (which is the preferred implementation platform), every time i go to python and import pysomap, it gives me the above error. Anybody know how to solve this?
Thanks

Assistant: This source code is over 5 years old and the build script for floyd looks to assume hard-coded python2.4. 
It seems pretty clear that your floyd module did not build. You will most likely have to go back to the build step and ensure that you are properly generating a _floyd.so. 
If you built it correctly, then this should not fail for you:
python -c "import _floyd"
