User: Running a command alongwith pip gives the following error. Even the command  pip -V  produces the following error. 
I read that the error is due to setuptools version 31.0.0 and it should be lower than 28.0.0. But the version of my setuptools is 26.1.1 and it still gives the same error.

Assistant: Upgrade your setuptools:

wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py -O - | sudo python3

Generally sudo combined with pip is considered harmful, avoid this when your system is not already broken.
