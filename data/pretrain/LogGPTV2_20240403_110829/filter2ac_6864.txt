title:blackhat:asia-22 USMA: Share Kernel Code With Me
The gadget is a mainstream attack method in the Linux kernel. It requires attackers to find available gadgets based on the vulnerability. This is a time-consuming task, and sometimes it is impossible to find a suitable gadget. In addition, the CFI mitigation (such as the PAC on ARM) is merged into the kernel, and it limits this method.This talk discloses a new cross-platform general attack method called USMA. It allows the process to map the kernel memory and modify the kernel code. With it, we can break the CFI mitigations and get ROOT privilege.
