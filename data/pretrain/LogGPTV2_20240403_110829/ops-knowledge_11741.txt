User: As a secondary task to a Python auto-completion (https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi), I'm writing a VIM plugin with the ability to do renaming (refactoring).
The most comfortable way to do renaming is to use cw and autocommand InsertLeave :call do_renaming_func(). To do this I need to access the redo-register (see help redo-register) or something similar, which would record the written text.
If possible, I like to do this without macros, because I don't want to mess up anything.
Assistant: The . register contains the last inserted text.  See :help quote_..
The help doesn't specifically mention any caveats of when this register is populated, however it does mention that it doesn't work when editing the command line.  This shouldn't be an issue for you.
