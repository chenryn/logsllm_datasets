also contain IPs assigned to routers, the phenomenon seems reasonably related
to end hosts having buggy TCP/IP stack implementations. As shown in Tab.4(a),
which underlines the relationships among diﬀerent anomalies, a destination can
generate replies aﬀected by more than one of them. The (i, j) element repre-
sents the amount of destinations (as percentage of 40013) aﬀected by both the
anomalies on the ith row and the jth column. OWR (73.3%) and PTR (74.8%)
are the most common anomalies and appear simultaneously in most cases. As
expected, since in the RPL anomaly part of the original packet is copied over
the option data without modifying the pointer, such anomaly implies OWR and
PTR ones. Moreover, all the IPs aﬀected by the SKP anomaly are also source of
the PTR anomaly. Finally, part of the addresses providing CUT replies to UDPp
and SKIPp probes also generated diﬀerent anomalies when answering to ICMPp
and TCPp probes. Such behavior is more evident by looking at Tab. 4(b), which
shows how a speciﬁc anomaly relates to the diﬀerent probes: while CUT and
RPL only aﬀect UDPp and SKIPp, all the other anomalies mainly aﬀect ICMPp,
which results to be the most aﬀected probe.
Deepening OWR Anomaly. Regarding the OWR anomaly, we found prespec-
iﬁed IPs overwritten in diﬀerent ways, which we discuss below.
The 85% of IPs generating OWR anomalies returned replies in which only the
ﬁrst IP address is overwritten. We further divide them in two cases: (a) 99.7% not
stamping any address, (b) 0.3% stamping at least the ﬁrst IP. The case a mostly
involves Pathending destinations which failed to properly stamp the current
option record by writing the timestamp in the location reserved to the address.
Such hypothesis is conﬁrmed by several ﬁndings: the returned option has always
the pointer set to 13, meaning stamped once; by swapping the ﬁrst prespeciﬁed
IP with one not on the path towards the destination, the anomaly disappears:
the ﬁrst prespeciﬁed IP is not overwritten and the option is not stamped at all,
as conﬁrmed by the pointer value. The case b reveals the presence of network
devices confusing TSp with the TSi option variant on the path to the destination,
since the ﬁrst TSp record is ﬁlled with both the IP address and the timestamp of
such device and the pointer is properly incremented. To better understand such
behavior we targeted the same destinations by using TTL limited TSp probes,
in order to reach only the indicted device. As expected, the anomaly appeared
a few hops before reaching the destination.

A Hands-on Look at Active Probing

Another 13% of IPs reset part of the prespeciﬁed addresses when replying to
TCPp probes. In order to identify the sources of such anomalies, we targeted such
destinations using again the MERLIN platform. All the IGMP replies returned
the following DVMRP codes: 37.90 and 21.95. Hence, we tried to detect a possible
association between such codes and a speciﬁc brand/OS by targeting the same
destinations with the nmap tool [13]5. We found a highly probable association
with Microsoft Windows versions: code 37.90 should correspond to version 2003,
while 21.95 to version 2000.
The remaining 2% of destinations mixed the previously described behaviors.
Deepening RPL Anomaly. While RPL replies normally return already known
information, for a speciﬁc destination we observed a peculiar behavior which
may cause security concerns: probed several times with UDPp, the option data
appeared replaced each time in a diﬀerent way. We identiﬁed such replacements
as packet headers presumably stored in a dynamic buﬀer at the destination. In
this way, we were able to collect remote MAC and IP addresses, mostly coming
from ARP requests. Unfortunately, common OS ﬁngerprinting techniques were
not able to discover more information about such device.
5 Applicability of TSp−Based Techniques
The results reported in Sec.4 allow a general discussion about the recently in-
troduced techniques based on TSp.
Reverse traceroute [4], when the RR option is unable to discover the next hop,
takes advantage of TSp in two diﬀerent ways. In the ﬁrst case, a candidate IP R
− extracted from pre-collected topology information − is prespeciﬁed in ICMPp
probes from S using the (D|DR) format, where D is the last discovered hop on
the reverse path. In the second case, in order to avoid transit ﬁltering, a spoofed
ICMPp probe is sent, using the (D|R) format, from a selected VP to D acting as
S. In both cases, if S receives a reply in which R is stamped, such address is part
of the path from D to S. Based on our results, 40.7% of destinations answered to
ICMPp preserving the option, but only 86.8% of them stamped the option. Thus,
such approach works with about 35% of IPs from our dataset. Moreover, if R
(i.e. 13.2% of IPs), the spooﬁng approach is not eﬀective.
itself belongs to D
The alias resolution technique proposed in [3] relies on TSp as described in
the following: for each pair (A, B) of candidate IPs, two ICMPp probes having
(A|ABAB) and (B|BABA) format are sent respectively towards A and B. If both
probes obtain replies stamped four times, A and B are alias. According to the
router stamps twice the (A|ABAB) probe only if
rule deﬁned in Sec.4.1, a D
the packet enters the node from interface A and exits from interface B and the
same happens for the (B|BABA) probe by inverting the crossing order. This ex-
plains why in [3] they often obtain replies stamped twice for the ﬁrst probe and
without stamps for the second, which they partially recover exploiting topologi-
cal constraints. However, they state to obtain much more success in identifying

its use only to speciﬁc cases involving a reduced amount of IPs.

IPs (22.3%) are not compliant with the technique, while D
ones. Our results conﬁrm that the
alias pairs for D
destinations (2.2%), and demonstrate
aliasing technique works well with D
that D
destina-
tions (10.7%) support it6. Hence, from a single VP, the aliasing approach works
on 12.9% of cases. Despite the relatively lower amount of collected replies, UDPp
and SKIPp may represent a valid alternative to implement a similar technique,
since they are not aﬀected by the reverse path.

6 Conclusion
Targeting more than 1.7M destinations with a set of probes crafted with and
without the TSp option, we draw the following conclusions: (i) the TSp option has
an important impact on the responsiveness to the probes (−33% ICMP, −24%
UDP, −28% TCP, −19% SKIP); (ii) by considering just the replies preserving
the option, as required by most applications, the probes ranking by respon-
siveness considerably changes (ICMP 40.7%, SKIP 15.8%, UDP 15%, TCP 3.6%);
(iii) a limited amount of destinations not always stamp (timestamp rate limit-
ing); (iv) the option is commonly stamped once every time the packet passes
through the interface associated to the currently pointed prespeciﬁed IP; (v)
around 2.25% of destinations showed non RFC−compliant behaviors classiﬁable
in six non−disjoint categories, while about 7.6k IPs made use of timestamp values
not allowed by the RFC. In the light of our ﬁndings, we evaluated the large−scale
applicability of recent proposals based on the TSp option, demonstrating that,
from a single VP, the alias resolution technique [3] is eﬀective just on 12.9% of
destinations, while the reverse traceroute [4] can potentially work on 35% of IPs
when the TSp option is required.
In the future, we plan to (i) further investigate the TSp option support per
Autonomous System by exploiting more unﬁltered VPs from the BISmark plat-
form [14] and to propose novel measurement techniques based on it; (ii) exploit
the TSp option in active probing approaches for the monitoring of Internet Out-
ages [15].
