• Smart speaker could be permanently damaged
• ‘Burning-out’ of components could be a fire hazard
• Other models may be vulnerable
Implications – Bluetooth and smart speakers

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• Attacks viable on some devices
– Any attack/malware capable of arbitrary code execution could deploy this
• Reliant on imperceptibility, susceptibility, exposure duration
• And on no audible components (subharmonics, distortion, etc)
– Could be attenuated with multiple fade ins/fade outs
Feasibility

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Our experiment
PwC
• Some attacks require physical/local access, Bluetooth attacks, etc
• Attackers may be more interested in other avenues
– Espionage, sabotage, financial, etc

• Deshotels, 2014
– Limit frequency range of speakers
– Visibly alerting users when speakers are in use
– Filtering files during processing to remove high/low frequency noise
– Mobiles: permission restrictions on use of speakers by apps
• Heuristic detection
– Rarely, if ever, should an application need access to volume levels
– Maybe muting apps
– Some legitimate uses for ultrasound (Google Nearby Messages, comms)

PwC
• Monitoring environment for HFN/LFN
– SLMs (most consumer models won’t go that high/low)
– Requires specialist equipment
– Android: Ultrasound Detector and Infrasound Detector
– We used both for our pilot study (Kardous & Shaw, 2014)
– Modern smartphones may be suitable for occupational noise measurement
– Within limitations of a given device
– And accepting a certain loss of accuracy

• SoundAlert for HFN detection – PoC only!
• Modified open source application (link below)
• Simple alerts when noise over a threshold is detected
Do not use to evaluate if there is risk of damage or 
adverse effects, or for safety/compliance assessments

Conclusion
Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
August 2019
71
PwC
• Small scale
• Limited number of devices
• Short exposure times
• Constant emission of HFN/LFN may degrade audio equipment
• No human experimentation on perceptibility/susceptibility
– Frequent limitation of research in this area
– Ethical and safety concerns have to come first
Limitations
72
August 2019
Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Conclusion
PwC
• In general, more research needed on the risk of HFN and LFN
• Wider range of equipment, larger-scale, longer durations
• Test overheating effects on other devices
– Take appropriate safety precautions!
• More work on countermeasures, especially detection
• Ethical restrictions make extrapolation challenging
• Get in touch to discuss more!
Future work

Sound Effects: Exploring acoustic cyber-weapons
Conclusion
PwC
• As digital and physical worlds become more integrated:
– Attackers may become increasingly interested in leveraging vulns against humans
– Attack surface likely to grow
– Attacks are (at the moment) often trivial
– And may become possible/more effective at scale
– Lack of consensus for adequate safety guidelines is a challenge
• However:
– Countermeasures are available
– Real-world consequences are difficult to assess
