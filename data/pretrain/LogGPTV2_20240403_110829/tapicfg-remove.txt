### `tapicfg remove` Command

**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `tapicfg remove` command is used to delete a TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface) application directory partition.

**Important:**
- You must be a member of the Enterprise Admins group in Active Directory to execute this command.

**Syntax:**
```plaintext
tapicfg remove /directory:<fully_qualified_domain_name>
```

**Parameters:**

- **/directory:**  
  - **Required.** Specifies the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of the TAPI application directory partition to be removed.
  
- **/?**  
  - Displays help information at the command prompt.

**Remarks:**
- This command can be executed on any computer that is a member of the domain.
- User-supplied text, such as the names of TAPI application directory partitions, servers, and domains, with International or Unicode characters, will only be displayed correctly if the appropriate fonts and language support are installed.
- If your organization still uses Internet Locator Service (ILS) servers to support certain applications, TAPI clients running on Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 can query either ILS servers or TAPI application directory partitions.
- The `tapicfg` tool can also be used to create or remove service connection points. If the TAPI application directory partition is renamed (e.g., due to a domain rename), you must remove the existing service connection point and create a new one with the updated FQDN. Failure to do so will prevent TAPI clients from locating and accessing the TAPI application directory partition.
- You can also remove a service connection point for maintenance or security reasons, such as when you do not want to expose TAPI data on a specific TAPI application directory partition.

This revised version aims to provide a clearer, more organized, and professional explanation of the `tapicfg remove` command.
