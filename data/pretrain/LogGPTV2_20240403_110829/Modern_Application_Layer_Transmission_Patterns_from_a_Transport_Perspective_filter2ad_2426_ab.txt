Fig. 1. Duration of trailing N periods
We next study the behavior of speciﬁc applications 4 with respect to trailing silent
periods. The right plot in Figure 1 shows the characteristics of each port that contributes
at least 1% of the connections with trailing silent periods. The labels on the x-axis
indicate the dataset—“C” for CCZ, “I” for ICSI—and port number for the applications,
with “other” being a combination of all ports not shown independently. The number just
above the x-axis shows the percentage of connections with trailing silent periods that
the given port is responsible for in the given dataset. For each port, the box shows the
quartiles of the distribution of the duration of the trailing silent periods and the whiskers
show the 1st and 99th percentiles.
The ﬁgure shows that at least three-quarters of the connections with trailing silent
periods across datasets are likely web trafﬁc (ports 80 and 443) and web trafﬁc gener-
ally shows the longest trailing silent periods. Additionally, we ﬁnd three times as much
“other” trafﬁc in the CCZ data as in the ICSI data. This is natural in that CCZ traf-
ﬁc contains more peer-to-peer trafﬁc that is widely distributed across the port range
and therefore confounds such simple port-based classiﬁcation (see [15] for details). We
ﬁnd that CCZ trafﬁc using port 83325 has short and highly uniform trailing silent pe-
riods. The “other” trafﬁc generally has the largest spread of trailing silent periods, as
one might expect, given that it is an amalgamation of different applications. The ICSI
dataset includes many SMTP connections with trailing silent periods; while half of
these are at least 10 seconds, the 99th percentile is only 19 seconds, which suggests that
a fairly tight timeout is in play. Finally, we ﬁnd that TCP-based DNS trafﬁc in the ICSI
dataset is responsible for roughly 1% of the trailing silent periods. Two ICSI hosts are
responsible for most of this DNS trafﬁc, and the general pattern of their connections is
consistent with a single, short DNS lookup followed by a 2 minute timeout—which is
consistent with the behavior speciﬁed in RFC 1035 [10].
6 Internal Silent Periods
Our next analysis is of silent periods that happen between periods of activity within con-
nections. These periods indicate an application imposing a non-bulk transfer structure
4 Our traces include only packet headers and therefore we rely on port numbers to identify
applications—as crude as that can sometimes be.
5 As discussed in [15], we have not been able to fully disambiguate this trafﬁc between Bitcoin
and an experimental security camera application known to be in use within the CCZ.

Fig. 2. Number of internal N periods per connection
on their activity. There could still be periods in which the application—and therefore
TCP—tries to move data as fast as possible in bulk transfer fashion, but these silent
periods indicate that is not the applications’ exclusive goal.
Silent Periods Per Connection: Recall from Table 2 that 36.7% and 28.1% of the
connections in the CCZ and ICSI datasets, respectively, contain at least one internal
silent period. From this we understand that a non-trivial fraction of the connections are
not solely concerned with bulk transfer. The left plot in Figure 2 shows the distribution
of the number of internal silent periods per connection in our two datasets. We ﬁnd
general agreement between the datasets with roughly half the connections having only
one internal silent period, and over 90% of the connections having no more than ten
internal silent periods. Therefore, while we ﬁnd that internal silent periods are not rare,
we also ﬁnd that they are in general not numerous on a per-connection basis.
The right plot in Figure 2 breaks down the number of silent periods per connection by
port for ports that contribute at least 1% of the connections with internal silent periods.
Again, the overall fraction of connections is given just above the x-axis, the bars repre-
sent quartiles and the whiskers show the 1st and 99th percentiles. We ﬁnd that over 60%
of the connections with internal silent periods in both datasets are web trafﬁc (ports 80
and 443). Further, most of the popular ports have a median of one internal silent period
per connection and the 75th percentile is under 10 periods across ports. This is consis-
tent with the overall distribution given in the left ﬁgure and shows that popular ports do
not drastically depart from the overall distribution. We do ﬁnd that IMAP connections
at ICSI (port 993) show a large 99th percentile—604 silent periods. This is expected for
email clients that leave connections open for pushed email.
Silent Period Duration: We next assess the duration of internal silent periods, as we
show in Figure 3. This plot shows that most such periods are short—with at least 30%
lasting at most 100 msec and two thirds lasting at most 1 second. These durations are
consistent with the “active off” periods previously identiﬁed in web trafﬁc [4]. However,
more than 10% of the internal silent periods across connections last at least 10 seconds.
These periods likely represent applications that run out of networking tasks.
The duration of internal silent periods is not as uniform across applications as their
number, as shown in Figure 3. For example, SMTP (port 25) is largely rapid exchanges,
with 75% of silent periods lasting less than about 100 msec and no silent period last-
ing more than a few seconds. On the other hand, web trafﬁc (ports 80 and 443) show
