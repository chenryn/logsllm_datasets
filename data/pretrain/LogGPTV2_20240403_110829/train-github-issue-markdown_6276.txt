I am a windows user with two windows monitors. I tend to have shortcuts on my
desktop ordered in a way unique to me. There are times that I either
accidentally sort my icons, or Windows mess up when my monitor goes to sleep,
and they all move around.
My father is a software engineer who wrote me a small application the backup
and restores desktop icon positions, that works over multi-monitors, by merely
keeping a save file of the coordinates of each shortcut on the desktop.
Seeing this feature would surely be helpful to others, and thus I request this
feature.
