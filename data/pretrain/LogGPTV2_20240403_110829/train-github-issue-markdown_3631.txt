When a user closes a modal, nothing gets focus. This breaks keyboard/tabbed
usability (possibly accessibility?). Consider a long form that a user tabs
through elements, and launches modals for things like help text. Ideally the
last button or element used to launch the modal would receive focus back and
the user could continue from where they left off.
Test: simply tab through http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/ and use only the
keyboard to launch the demo modal, escape it, then start tabbing again to see
the behavior in action.
