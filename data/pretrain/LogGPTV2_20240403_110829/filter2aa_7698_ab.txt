type is a decimal number or one of the strings \fBlocal\fR, \fBIP\fR,
\fBMAC\fR, \fBmagic\fR, or \fBphone\fR.  The value is an IP address in
dotted-decimal notation for the \fBIP\fR type, or a string of bytes in
hexadecimal, separated by periods or colons for the other types.  For
the MAC type, the value may also be the name of an ethernet or similar
network interface.  This option is currently only available under
Linux.
.TP
.B hide-password
When logging the contents of PAP packets, this option causes pppd to
exclude the password string from the log.  This is the default.
.TP
.B holdoff \fIn
Specifies how many seconds to wait before re-initiating the link after
it terminates.  This option only has any effect if the \fIpersist\fR
or \fIdemand\fR option is used.  The holdoff period is not applied if
the link was terminated because it was idle.
.TP
.B idle \fIn
Specifies that pppd should disconnect if the link is idle for \fIn\fR
seconds.  The link is idle when no data packets (i.e. IP packets) are
being sent or received.  Note: it is not advisable to use this option
with the \fIpersist\fR option without the \fIdemand\fR option.
If the \fBactive-filter\fR
option is given, data packets which are rejected by the specified
activity filter also count as the link being idle.
.TP
.B ipcp-accept-local
加上这个选项的话，pppd将会接受彼端对于本地IP位址
的意见，即使本地的IP位址已经在某个选项中指定。
.TP
.B ipcp-accept-remote
加上这个选项的话，pppd将会接受彼端对于它的IP位址
的意见，即使远端的IP位址已经在某个选项中指定。
.TP
.B ipcp-max-configure \fIn
 将IPCP配置要求(configure-request)传输的最大数目设
为n（预设为10）。
.TP
.B ipcp-max-failure \fIn
将开始传送配置拒绝(configure-Rejects)之前的IPCP配
置未接收(configure-NAKs)的最大数目以取代n（预设
为10）。
.TP
.B ipcp-max-terminate \fIn
 将IPCP终结要求(terminate-request)传输的最大数目设
为 n（预设为3）。
.TP
.B ipcp-restart \fIn
 将IPCP重新开始的间隔（重新传输的时间限制）设为n
秒钟（预设为3）。
.TP
.B ipparam \fIstring
Provides an extra parameter to the ip-up and ip-down scripts.  If this
option is given, the \fIstring\fR supplied is given as the 6th
parameter to those scripts.
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP configure-NAKs returned before starting
to send configure-Rejects instead to \fIn\fR (default 10).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPv6CP terminate-request transmissions to
\fIn\fR (default 3).
.TP
.B ipv6cp-restart \fIn
Set the IPv6CP restart interval (retransmission timeout) to \fIn\fR
seconds (default 3).
.TP
.B ipx
Enable the IPXCP and IPX protocols.  This option is presently only
supported under Linux, and only if your kernel has been configured to
include IPX support.
.TP
.B ipx-network \fIn
Set the IPX network number in the IPXCP configure request frame to
\fIn\fR, a hexadecimal number (without a leading 0x).  There is no
valid default.  If this option is not specified, the network number is
obtained from the peer.  If the peer does not have the network number,
the IPX protocol will not be started.
.TP
.B ipx-node \fIn\fB:\fIm
Set the IPX node numbers. The two node numbers are separated from each
other with a colon character. The first number \fIn\fR is the local
node number. The second number \fIm\fR is the peer's node number. Each
node number is a hexadecimal number, at most 10 digits long. The node
numbers on the ipx-network must be unique. There is no valid
default. If this option is not specified then the node numbers are
obtained from the peer.
.TP
.B ipx-router-name \fI
Set the name of the router. This is a string and is sent to the peer
as information data.
.TP
.B ipx-routing \fIn
Set the routing protocol to be received by this option. More than one
instance of \fIipx-routing\fR may be specified. The '\fInone\fR'
option (0) may be specified as the only instance of ipx-routing. The
values may be \fI0\fR for \fINONE\fR, \fI2\fR for \fIRIP/SAP\fR, and
\fI4\fR for \fINLSP\fR.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-local
Accept the peer's NAK for the node number specified in the ipx-node
option. If a node number was specified, and non-zero, the default is
to insist that the value be used. If you include this option then you
will permit the peer to override the entry of the node number.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-network
Accept the peer's NAK for the network number specified in the
ipx-network option. If a network number was specified, and non-zero, the
default is to insist that the value be used. If you include this
option then you will permit the peer to override the entry of the node
number.
.TP
.B ipxcp-accept-remote
Use the peer's network number specified in the configure request
frame. If a node number was specified for the peer and this option was
not specified, the peer will be forced to use the value which you have
specified.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-configure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPXCP configure request frames which the
system will send to \fIn\fR. The default is 10.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-failure \fIn
Set the maximum number of IPXCP NAK frames which the local system will
send before it rejects the options. The default value is 3.
.TP
.B ipxcp-max-terminate \fIn
Set the maximum nuber of IPXCP terminate request frames before the
local system considers that the peer is not listening to them. The
default value is 3.
.TP
.B kdebug \fIn
开启核心层级中的PPP驱动程式侦错码。The argument values 
depend on the specific kernel driver, but in general a value of
1 will enable general kernel debug messages.  (Note that these
messages are usually only useful for debugging the kernel driver
itself.)  For the Linux 2.2.x kernel driver, 参数n是一个
由下列值所组合的数字：1开启一般侦错讯息，2要求印
出所接收到的封包内容，而4要求印出传输的封包内容。
On most systems, messages printed by
the kernel are logged by syslog(1) to a file as directed in the
/etc/syslog.conf configuration file.
.TP
.B ktune
Enables pppd to alter kernel settings as appropriate.  Under Linux,
pppd will enable IP forwarding (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
to 1) if the \fIproxyarp\fR option is used, and will enable the
dynamic IP address option (i.e. set /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_dynaddr to
1) in demand mode if the local address changes.
.TP
.B lcp-echo-failure \fIn
 如果有给这个选项，那么如果传送n个LCP回应要求没
有接收到有效的LCP回应回复的话pppd将会推测彼端是
死掉的。如果发生这种情形，pppd将会终结该连线。这个
选项的使用要求一个非零的lcp-echo-interval参数值。
这个选项可以用在硬体数据机控制线路无法使用的情况下
当实际连线被中断之后（e.g.,数据机已经挂断）终结
pppd的执行。
.TP
.B lcp-echo-interval \fIn
如果有给这个选项，pppd每秒将会送出一个LCP回
应要求(echo-request)封包(frame)给彼端。在Linux系
统下，回应要求在n秒内没有从彼端接收到封包时会被送
出。一般彼端应该以传送一个回应回复(echo-reply)来反
应该回应要求。这个选项可以与lcp-echo-failure选项
一起使用来侦测不再连线的彼端。
.TP
.B lcp-max-configure \fIn
 将LCP配置要求(configure-request)传输的最大数目设
为n（预设为10）。
.TP
.B lcp-max-failure \fIn
 将开始传送配置拒绝(configure-Rejects)之前的LCP配
置未接收(configure-NAKs)的最大数目设置为n（预设
为10）。
.TP
.B lcp-max-terminate \fIn
 将LCP终结要求(terminate-request)传输的最大数目设
为n（预设为3）。
.TP
.B lcp-restart \fIn
将LCP重新开始的间隔（重新传输的时间限制）设为
秒钟（预设为3）。
.TP
.B linkname \fIname\fR
Sets the logical name of the link to \fIname\fR.  Pppd will create a
file named \fBppp-\fIname\fB.pid\fR in /var/run (or /etc/ppp on some
systems) containing its process ID.  This can be useful in determining
which instance of pppd is responsible for the link to a given peer
system.  This is a privileged option.
.TP
.B local
不要使用数据机控制线路。  With this option, pppd will ignore
the state of the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the modem and will
not change the state of the DTR (Data Terminal Ready) signal.
.TP
.B logfd \fIn
Send log messages to file descriptor \fIn\fR.  Pppd will send log
messages to at most one file or file descriptor (as well as sending
the log messages to syslog), so this option and the \fBlogfile\fR
option are mutually exclusive.  The default is for pppd to send log
messages to stdout (file descriptor 1), unless the serial port is
already open on stdout.
.TP
.B logfile \fIfilename
Append log messages to the file \fIfilename\fR (as well as sending the
log messages to syslog).  The file is opened with the privileges of
the user who invoked pppd, in append mode.
.TP
.B login
使用系统密码资料库验证使用PAP的彼端。
and record the user in the system wtmp file.  Note that the peer
must have an entry in the /etc/ppp/pap-secrets file as well as the
system password database to be allowed access.
.TP
.B maxconnect \fIn
Terminate the connection when it has been available for network
traffic for \fIn\fR seconds (i.e. \fIn\fR seconds after the first
network control protocol comes up).
.TP
.B maxfail \fIn
Terminate after \fIn\fR consecutive failed connection attempts.  A
value of 0 means no limit.  The default value is 10.
.TP
.B modem
使用数据机控制线路。This option is the default.  With this
option, pppd will wait for the CD (Carrier Detect) signal from the
modem to be asserted when opening the serial device (unless a connect
script is specified), and it will drop the DTR (Data Terminal Ready)
signal briefly when the connection is terminated and before executing
the connect script. 在Ultrix上，这个选项会实作硬
体流量控制，像crtsct选项作的。
.TP
.B mp
Enables the use of PPP multilink; this is an alias for the `multilink'
option.  This option is currently only available under Linux.
.TP
.B mpshortseq
Enables the use of short (12-bit) sequence numbers in multilink
headers, as opposed to 24-bit sequence numbers.  This option is only
available under Linux, and only has any effect if multilink is
enabled (see the multilink option).
.TP
.B mrru \fIn
Sets the Maximum Reconstructed Receive Unit to \fIn\fR.  The MRRU is
the maximum size for a received packet on a multilink bundle, and is
analogous to the MRU for the individual links.  This option is
currently only available under Linux, and only has any effect if
multilink is enabled (see the multilink option).
.TP
.B ms-dns \fI
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows clients, this
option allows pppd to supply one or two DNS (Domain Name Server)
addresses to the clients.  The first instance of this option specifies
the primary DNS address; the second instance (if given) specifies the
secondary DNS address.  (This option was present in some older
versions of pppd under the name \fBdns-addr\fR.)
.TP
.B ms-wins \fI
If pppd is acting as a server for Microsoft Windows or "Samba"
clients, this option allows pppd to supply one or two WINS (Windows
Internet Name Services) server addresses to the clients.  The first
instance of this option specifies the primary WINS address; the second
instance (if given) specifies the secondary WINS address.
.TP
.B multilink
Enables the use of the PPP multilink protocol.  If the peer also
supports multilink, then this link can become part of a bundle between
the local system and the peer.  If there is an existing bundle to the
peer, pppd will join this link to that bundle, otherwise pppd will
create a new bundle.  See the MULTILINK section below.  This option is
currently only available under Linux.
.TP
.B name \fIname
将本地系统的名称设为用来进行验证。
This is a privileged option.  With this option, pppd will
use lines in the secrets files which have \fIname\fR as the second
field when looking for a secret to use in authenticating the peer.  In
addition, unless overridden with the \fIuser\fR option, \fIname\fR
will be used as the name to send to the peer when authenticating the
local system to the peer.  (Note that pppd does not append the domain
name to \fIname\fR.)
.TP
.B netmask \fIn
 把该界面网路掩码设为，这是一个以″十进位数值加
小数点″("decimaldot")符号表示的32位元网路掩码
(e.g.255.255.255.0)。If this option is given, the value
specified is ORed with the default netmask.  The default netmask is
chosen based on the negotiated remote IP address; it is the
appropriate network mask for the class of the remote IP address, ORed
with the netmasks for any non point-to-point network interfaces in the
system which are on the same network.  (Note: on some platforms, pppd
will always use 255.255.255.255 for the netmask, if that is the only
appropriate value for a point-to-point interface.)
.TP
.B noaccomp
Disable Address/Control compression in both directions (send and
receive).
.TP
.B noauth
Do not require the peer to authenticate itself.  This option is
privileged.
.TP
.B nobsdcomp
Disables BSD-Compress compression; \fBpppd\fR will not request or
agree to compress packets using the BSD-Compress scheme.
