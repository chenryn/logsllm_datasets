An attacker with physical access to a Windows system can obtain the SYSKEY
(also called the boot key) by using the following steps:
1. Booting another operating system (such as Kali).
2. Stealing the SAM and SYSTEM hives (C:\\sys32\config).
3. Recovering the boot key from the SYSTEM hive using bkreg or bkhive.
4. Dump the password hashes.
5. Crack them offline with a tool such as John the Ripper.

Client-side Attacks
Note that if you access a file in Windows, you modify the MAC (modify,
access, and change), which is how Windows logs your presence. To avoid
leaving forensic evidence, it is recommended to copy the target host
system prior to launching attacks.
Mounting Windows
There are tools available for capturing the Windows SAM and SYSKEY files. One
method to capture these files is mounting the target Windows system so that the
other tools can access these files while Microsoft Windows is not running.
The first step is to use the fdisk -l command to identify your partitions. You must
identify the Windows and partition types. The fdisk output shows a NTFS partition,
as follows:
Device Boot Start End Blocks Id System
/dev/hdb1* 1 2432 19535008+ 86 NTFS
/dev/hdb2 2433 2554 979965 82 Linux swap/Solaris
/dev/hdb3 2555 6202 29302560 83 Linux
Create a mount point using the command mkdir /mnt/windows.
Mount the Windows system using the command as shown in the following example:
mount -t   /mnt/windows
Now that your target Windows system is mounted, you can copy the SAM and
SYSTEM files into your attack directory using the following command:
cp SAM SYSTEM /pentest/passwords/AttackDirectory
There are tools available for dumping the SAM file. PwDump and Cain and Abel
are just a few examples. Kali offers samdump shown, in the password tools section
of this chapter.
Note that you will need to recover both the Bootkey and SAM files.
The Bootkey file is used to access the SAM file. Tools used to access the
SAM file will require the Bootkey file.

Chapter 4
bkreg and bkhive are popular tools that can obtain the Bootkey file, as shown in the
following screenshot:
Linux passwords
Linux host systems are not as common as Windows and pose a different challenge
for obtaining ROOT access. Many systems may have passwords stored in the clear
when auto-login is enabled such as the .netrc files used for Telnet and FTP. For
most attacks, you will want to capture the passwd and shadow files commonly stored
at /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow.
The shadow file is readable only by ROOT and typically an MD5 hash. The shadow
file is harder to capture than a Window's SAM file. There are methods of capturing
the shadow file using boot loaders such as grub.
Breaking a Linux password is similar to other systems such as Windows. Most
hybrid automated cracking programs such as John the Ripper can identify the type
of hash and brute-force attack the shadow passwords with the right dictionary.
Kali password cracking tools
Kali offers various utilities to bypass password security. Password cracking tools can
be found under Password Attacks and divided into tools used for offline and online
attacks. This section will focus on tools used to compromise host systems during a
web application Penetration Test. There are other tools available in Kali, such as tools
designed to crack passwords for wireless protocols; however, that is out of scope for
this text.

Client-side Attacks
Note that John the Ripper command line and Hydra were covered in
Chapter 3, Server-side Attacks.
Johnny
Johnny is a GUI for the very popular John the Ripper password cracking tool. We
covered the traditional command-line version of John the Ripper is Chapter 3, Server-
side Attacks. Like the command-line version, Johnny has several engines that allows
it to crack different types of passwords, including encrypted and hashed passwords.
Johnny has the ability to auto-detect most hashes and encrypted passwords, making
the process easier for Penetration Testers. Attackers like the tool because it is very
customizable and can be configured in a variety of different ways to speedup
password cracking.
Some customizations may not be available in Johnny. We recommend the
command-line version, John the Ripper, for most attacks.
John the Ripper operates in the following manner:
• Attempts cracking passwords with dictionary words
• Uses dictionary words with alphanumeric characters appended and
prepended
• Puts dictionary words together
• Adds alphanumeric characters to combine words
• Runs dictionary words with special characters mixed in
• When all else fails, attempts brute-force.
To use Johnny, go to Password Attacks | Offline Attacks and select Johnny.
Click on Open Password File and select the password file you want to crack.
The following screenshot shows a shadow file with users BOB, mary, and joey
as the targets.

The Password tab will be filled as Johnny cracks the passwords.
Johnny has configuration tabs on the left side. The Options tab is where you select
the type of attack. The following screenshot shows a definition of the default
behavior and options for selecting the type of hash. Johnny's auto-detection is
typically 90 percent correct.

Client-side Attacks
The Statistics tab displays how long Johnny has been running an active session.
The Settings tab specifies how Johnny will run as shown in the following example:
Note that the default settings for the path to John the Ripper may not be
correct. Make sure to verify the path to John the Ripper under Settings.
In older versions of BackTrack, we found you have to update the path
manually to /pentest/passwords/john/john. Kali 1.0 default is /
user/sbin/john.
The Output tab showcases what Johnny is attacking. You will also find error
messages and updates on the status of an attack session. The following example
shows a message displaying Johnny identifying the type of hash:
John the Ripper and its GUI frontend's default wordlists are very limited. We
recommend using a larger list, which can be found by searching online. To use a
custom wordlist, go to the Options tab and select Wordlist mode. Browse to your
custom wordlist and click on Apply.

Johnny will fill the password cells next to usernames as passwords are cracked. The
following screenshot shows two of the three passwords cracked:
hashcat and oclHashcat
hashcat and oclHashcat are password cracker utilities. oclHashcat is a GPGPU-
based version. The hashcat/oclHashcat utilities are multithread tools that can handle
multiple hashes and password lists during a single attack session. The hashcat/
oclHashcat utilities offer many attack options, such as brute-force, combinator,
dictionary, hybrid, mask, and rule-based attacks.

Client-side Attacks
BackTrack offers many versions of hashcat found under Privilege Escalation
| Password Attacks | Offline Attacks. The "ocl", or open cl, is the open
implementation to unify the Nvidia and ATI GPU drivers. Some versions may
not run even after updating BackTrack. You may need to download the updated
versions from www.hashcat.net.
To use hashcat, open the hashcat application or navigate to Password Attacks
| Offline Attacks | hashcat.
To use hashcat on a document, type hashcat [options] hashfile
[wordfiles|directories. The following example shows hashcat running a
wordlist against a shadow file:
hashcat offers a GUI as well, which acts as a frontend for the CLI. Some people like
it, because it's simple to use and includes displaying the command-line code at the
bottom window.

samdump2
samdump2 is a utility that dumps the Microsoft Windows password hashes from
a SAM file so that they can be cracked by an offline tool. For newer versions of
Windows, you will need another tool to capture the SYSKEY (boot key) file to
access the hashes stored in the SAM database.
samdump2 can be found under Password Attacks | Offline Attacks | samdump2.
When you open samdump, a Terminal window will pop up.
You must mount your target Windows system so that samdump can access the SAM file.
Next, copy the SAM and SYSTEM files into your attack directory.
cp SAM SYSTEM /root/AttackDirectory
Navigate to the attack directory and issue bkhive SYSTEM bootkey to obtain the
bootkey. Copy the bootkey into a text file so that samdump has the SAM file with
bootkey.
cd /root/AttackDirectory > windowshashfiles.txt
Execute samdump using the samdump SAM bootkey command. Copy the output
into a second text file.
Samdump2 SAM bootkey > windowshashfiles2.txt
Now use a password cracking tool such as John the Ripper to crack the hashes!
chntpw
chntpw is a tool on Kali Linux, Backtrack, and other Linux distributions that resets
local passwords on Windows 8 and earlier versions of Windows. It modifies the
Windows password database. This tool is primarily used for getting into Windows
boxes when you do not know the password.
[ 161 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
To use chntpw, boot up the Windows machine with the Kali Live CD. To download
Kali Linux, go to http://www.kali.org/downloads/ and download the ISO image.
Burn the ISO to a CD and boot the Windows machine with the Live CD. On the boot
menu for Kali, select Forensics option.
The SAM file is usually located under /Windows/System32/config. You will need
to navigate in the Terminal screen to this directory. On your system, it may look
something like this:
/media/hda1/Windows/System32/config
Every system might be slightly different. In this example, Kali seems to be using the
serial number of my hard drive as the device location. This is because I have booted
up a Windows 7 virtual machine with the Kali Live CD. The SAM database is usually
in the /media/name_of_hard_drive /Windows/System32/config.
[ 162 ]

Chapter 4
The following screenshot lists the SAM database file on my hard drive:
The command chntpw -l SAM will list out all the usernames that are contained on
the Windows system. The following screenshot shows us the result of running the
command chntpw –l SAM:
The command gives us a list of usernames on the system. When we have the
username we want to modify, we run the command chntpw -u "username" SAM.
In this example, we have typed chntpw -u "Administrator" SAM, and we got the
following menu:
We now have the option of clearing the password, changing the password, or
promoting the user to administrator. Changing the password does not always work
on Windows 7 systems, so we recommend clearing the password. By doing this, you
will be able to log into the target system with a blank password.
[ 163 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
To access chntpw, go to Password Attacks | Offline Attacks | chntpw. A Terminal
window will open, showcasing the welcome screen for chntpw. There are a few
ways to use chntpw, as described on the main landing page as follows:
To use the interactive mode, type chntpw -i and the path to the SAM file. If the target
is a mounted system, you will need to specify the location of the SAM file inside the
mounted directory.
A menu will popup providing options for changing the SAM file. You can select
option 1 to blank out the password.

Ophcrack
Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker based on Rainbow tables. Kali offers a CLI
and GUI version. Ophcrack can import hashes from a variety of formats including
dumping directly from the SAM files of Windows. The following screenshot shows
some of the available formats to load into Ophcrack:
Ophcrack comes with built-in Rainbow tables, as shown in the following example. We
recommend loading the latest Rainbow tables rather than using the default tables.
[ 165 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Client-side Attacks
Rainbow tables are available from online sources such as the developer's website
http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php.
To access ophcrack, go to Password Attacks | Offline Attacks and select either the
CLI or GUI version. Click on Load, and select the path to the file you want to crack
(for example, a Windows SAM file).

Chapter 4
For this example, we used the Kali ISO on a Windows machine and booted Kali in
Forensics mode. We browsed to the /windows/system32/config directory to get to
the SAM database. You can learn more about using Kali Linux in the Forensics mode
in Chapter 7, Defensive Countermeasures, of this book. You can also use an offline copy
of the SAM database directly with Kali.

You should see the hash with the username and user ID. Click on the Crack button
and wait for the password.
Crunch
Crunch is a tool used to generate password lists. This can be extremely helpful if you
are able to gather intelligence on how your target creates passwords. For example, if
you capture two passwords and notice the target uses a phase followed by random
digits, Crunch can be used to quickly generate a list of that phrase followed by all the
possible random digits.
[ 168 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 4
Crunch has special characters that translate to the following:
• @: Inserts lowercase characters
• %: Inserts numbers
• ,: Inserts uppercase characters
• ^: Inserts symbols
For this example, we will assume we know our target uses pass followed by two
unknown characters in their password. To run Crunch for a six character password
having pass followed by two unknown numbers, use %% to represent any number.
To run this and place the output in a text file named newpasswordlist.txt, use the
example input:
The output text file will contain all the possible number combinations. The following
screenshot shows the top of the output file:

To add all lowercase letters, use crunch 6 6 -t pass followed by @@ representing
all the lowercase letters, as shown in the following example:
Now the text file has all lowercase letters and numbers as shown in the
following example:
Other tools available in Kali
There are other useful tools found in Kali. We have limited the list to utilities that
assist with compromising host systems accessing web application servers. There are
other password cracking tools available in Kali not shown in this list; however, the
focus of those tools is out of scope for this text.
Hash-identifier
Hash-identifier is a Python utility used to identify hash types. Most password
cracking tools such as John the Ripper include a auto-detection function for hashes
which are very good and probably 90 percent accurate. This utility can be used to
verify a hash type manually. To use Hash-identifier, run the utility and paste it in
a copy of the hash.

dictstat
dictstat is a Python script utility used for password cracking results analysis or for
a regular wordlist analysis. dictstat will analyze results and provide masks for
brute-forcing password combinations that have already been cracked. This will
likely provide clues for cracking more hashes in the bunch. This can be helpful
when targeting a company with a password policy. The following screenshot

RainbowCrack (rcracki_mt)
RainbowCrack is the hash cracking program that generates rainbow tables to be
used in password cracking. RainbowCrack is different than the standard brute-force
approach by using large pre-computed tables to reduce the length of time needed to
crack a password. RainbowCrack is a decent application; however, there are many
free Rainbow tables available for download, such as www.freerainbowtables.com.
