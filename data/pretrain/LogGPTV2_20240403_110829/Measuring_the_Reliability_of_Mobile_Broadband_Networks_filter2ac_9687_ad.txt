a failure in a load balancer in their CN.
One of the largest events recorded in our measurement
period took place in Tele2 on Nov. 1-2, when 86% of con-
nections were unavailable for more than 6 hours. 41% of
the aﬀected connections lost the PDP context during this
period, while the others maintained a valid IP address but
could not send or receive any data. The failure aﬀected only
Tele2 connections camping on Netcom’s RAN, and Tele2
has conﬁrmed that the root cause of the failure was a failing
component in the peering between these two networks.
An interesting event took place on Oct. 21-22, and aﬀected
all Network Norway connections camping on Telenor’s RAN.
These connections experienced around 50% packet loss for
more than 11 hours. We also observe that the packet loss
rate was higher at times when traﬃc volumes are higher,

of the connections that experience a high loss rate also ex-
perience much downtime and have low Ec/Io values. Out of
the 341 connections where we have all the necessary meta-
data to make this comparison, 8.8% have an average loss
rate higher than 10%. As seen in the ﬁgure, most of these
(73%) have either a downtime ratio >5%, Ec/Io  10%(8.8% of connections)2.3%Downtime > 5%(6.7% of connections)Ec/Io < -15 dBm(6.7% of connections)2.3%0.3%2.3%1.8%2.3%1.8% 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 5 10PDFLost replies in a rowTelenorNetcomTele2Network NorwayIce53Figure 14: Large events since July 2013.
indicating a capacity problem in the connection between
these two networks. Network Norway later conﬁrmed that
this event was caused by a routing problem that sent traﬃc
through a roaming exchange point normally used for inter-
national roaming traﬃc only. This link is dimensioned for
signiﬁcantly lower traﬃc volumes, and could therefore not
support the oﬀered load.
In our discussions with the network operators, we have
learned that several of the loss events identiﬁed in this study
were not detected by their internal monitoring systems. These
systems detect situations where many customers lose their
Internet connections, but not necessarily situations where
packet loss is less than 100%. This shows the potential of
end-user measurements, and illustrates how they can help
operators discover weaknesses and failures in their networks.
Summary of ﬁndings. In this section, we revealed clear
diﬀerences in packet loss between operators. While Telenor
has a non-negligible but low packet loss in most connec-
tions, other operators have higher variation in loss among
connections. Telenor (and Network Norway@Telenor) also
has a high number of loss runs of size 5 or 6, which tend to
occur when connections lose their radio channel. Such short-
lived gaps in packet forwarding can have a negative eﬀect on
applications such as interactive games, which often do not
produce enough traﬃc to acquire a dedicated radio channel.
Overall, the measured loss remains unexpectedly high since
MBB networks rely heavily on link-layer retransmission to
rectify errors. Our observations thus far, however, indicate
that this unexpected loss is mainly related to state RRC
transitions. We defer investigating the exact causes of loss
to a followup study. Finally, we have used loss data to iden-
tify events that aﬀect a signiﬁcant fraction of connections in
a single MBB network. An online alarm system based on
end-to-end measurements that discovers such events can be
useful for both operators and regulators.
6. APPLICATION LAYER RELIABILITY
An important aspect of reliability is a stable performance
on the application layer.
In this section, we look at the
stability in performance of two representative applications:
HTTP download and VoIP using the SIP protocol.
Figure 15: Failure rates in HTTP download tests.
6.1 HTTP download test
Much of the traﬃc in MBB networks goes over the HTTP
protocol, which is used for both web browsing and stream-
ing. Here, we report results from a simple experiment where
a 1 MByte ﬁle is downloaded from a server using the HTTP
GET method. For each test iteration, we record the time it
took to start the data transfer, the total time to complete
the download (if successful), throughput, and any error code.
For each connection, the test was repeated once per hour for
a duration of 3 weeks, giving a total of up to 504 runs per
connection. Based on these measurements, we report on two
diﬀerent metrics: the probability of successfully completing
the transfer, and the probability of achieving a download
rate of at least 1 Mbps.
Note that our aim here is to look at the stability of the
application layer performance, and not to measure the max-
imum achievable throughput in the connection, which would
require a diﬀerent approach.
Figure 15 shows the fraction of download attempts that
could not be successfully completed. We observe that the
fraction of failing attempts is signiﬁcantly higher in Telenor
than in the other networks. 55% of Telenor connections ex-
perience a failure rate higher than 5%, and 12% experience
a failure rate higher than 10%. Ice, on the other hand, sees
very few unsuccessful downloads, with only 9% of connec-
tions having a failure rate above 1%.

Figure 17: Failure rates in VoIP tests.
Looking at the error codes for the unsuccessful transfers,
we ﬁnd that the dominating reason for a failed download
in all networks except Telenor is the failure to establish the
connection. Correlating erroneous transfers with the data
from our connectivity test we observed that these unsuccess-
ful TCP handshakes happen during times with high packet
loss. For Telenor, however, the connection broke after the
initial TCP handshake in 74% of the failing attempts. Such
errors are largely responsible for the diﬀerence between Te-
lenor and the other networks. Looking closer at these events,
we ﬁnd that they happen when the connection can not be
promoted from the CELL FACH to the CELL DCH state.
The download traﬃc will normally trigger such a promotion,
but when this does not happen, the modem responds by re-
setting the connection, and the download fails. There is a
clear diurnal pattern in this type of failures, which makes it
natural to believe that they are related to congestion in the
FACH channel and/or insuﬃcient resources for a promotion
to CELL DCH.
Figure 16 shows, for each connection, the fraction of runs
where the achieved throughput was less than 1 Mbps. Only
3G connections are included in this plot. We observe that
in all UMTS operators, most connections achieve this down-
load rate most of the time. In Netcom, Tele2 and Network
Norway, around 90% of connections achieve at least 1 Mbps
90% of the time or more. Telenor achieves this rate less of-
ten. We believe that this is caused by the higher loss rate ob-
served in Telenor and how it interacts with TCP congestion
control. Ice achieves far lower throughput than the UMTS
operators. Around 20% of the connections never achieve the
target download speed, while only 19% of connections meets
the target in 90% of the cases. From Figs. 15 and 16, we
conclude that Ice oﬀers a slower but more stable download
performance than the UMTS networks.
6.2 Voice-over-IP test
Initiating VoIP calls over MBB connections is becoming
increasingly popular, thanks to the rise of applications such
as Viber [24]. The ability to initiate and complete VoIP calls
are therefore important aspects of the user-experienced reli-
ability. To asses this ability we design a simple experiment
that faithfully emulates a real VoIP call. Our test consists
of a custom-made client that runs on the measurement node
and an Asterisk PBX [6] hosted at the NNE backend. The
client initiates a VoIP call to the PBX using SIP, then it
uses RTP to play a one minute long audio ﬁle. Upon com-
pletion the PBX replays the same ﬁle back to the client and
terminates the call. The audio ﬁle is encoded as G.711 [1]
resulting in a sending rate of about 50 packets per second.
For each connection, we run this experiment once per hour
for one week, giving us 168 calls per connection.
Figure 17 illustrates the fraction of calls that could not be
successfully completed. We observe that the failure rate is
signiﬁcantly higher for Telenor. 30% of Telenor connections
have a failure rate higher than 15% compared to only 4% of
Tele2 connections. 34% and 21% of the failures for Netcom
and Tele2 respectively happened during the call initiation
phase (i.e. the SIP INVITE fails). For Telenor and Network
Norway, however, this percentage drops to 13% and 14.9%
respectively. The remaining failures happened after the call
started successfully. We believe that the explanation for
these dropped calls is the same as for the unsuccessful HTTP
downloads discussed above.
Summary of ﬁndings. This section has shown that short
pauses in packet forwarding that are likely caused by the
lack of available radio resources can lead to signiﬁcant prob-
lems for applications, such as dropped calls and failed down-
loads.
7. ROBUSTNESS BY MULTI-HOMING
So far, our discussion has focused on the experienced reli-
ability in each MBB network separately. A related question
is how much reliability can be increased if an end device can
be simultaneously connected to more than one MBB net-
work. Such multi-homed devices are becoming increasingly
popular, for example as mobile gateways that provide WiFi
service on public transport.
The potential for increased reliability through end device
multi-homing depends heavily on whether coverage and fail-
ure patterns are largely independent across operators.
If
connections to diﬀerent operators tend to fail simultane-
ously due to the same underlying reasons, there is little
to be gained from a redundant connection. Our discussion
in this section focuses on three important aspects of cross-
correlation between operators: coverage, connection failures
and loss events.
7.1 Correlations in coverage
We ﬁrst look at whether diﬀerent operators are similar
with respect to signal quality at a given location. NNE
measurement nodes are distributed widely across Norway,
and we believe they give a reasonable representation of the
indoor signal quality that can be expected in each operator.
Figure 18 gives an overview of the Ec/Io values for all
UMTS connections in all nodes in our dataset. The values
shown are averages across the whole measurement period
(for most connections the variation is small). Since almost

all nodes have a Telenor connection, we sort the nodes based
on the Ec/Io of the Telenor connection, and plot Ec/Io val-
ues for the other connections where available.
We observe that there does not seem to be a strong cor-
relation between operators in general. As expected, we ﬁnd
that for some nodes, Netcom/Tele2 and Telenor/Network
Norway have pairwise very similar Ec/Io due to their na-
tional roaming arrangements. Calculating the Pearson cor-
relation coeﬃcient for each pair of operators conﬁrms the
visual impression from Fig. 18. The correlation coeﬃcient
for the pairs of operators that do not share the same RAN
is between -0.10 (Netcom and Network Norway) and 0.25
(Telenor and Netcom). The correlation is evidently higher
when the respective pair of operators share the same RAN,
that is 0.47 for Tele2 and Netcom and 0.75 for Telenor and
Network Norway. We also performed a similar analysis for
RSSI values, which gave similar results. These ﬁndings are
positive from a robustness perspective, since they indicate
that there is a signiﬁcant potential gain from provider multi-
homing.
7.2 Correlations in downtime
Next, we revisit the connection failures discussed in Sec. 4,
to see how downtime could be reduced if the end user is
able to connect to more than one operator. For each pair
of connections from the same node, we identify the time
periods when both connections were unavailable (i.e., they
had no PDP context). The resulting downtime represents a
lower limit on the downtime that can be achieved if the end
system is able to exploit both connections in parallel.
Figure 19 shows the downtime for three operators (re-
peated from Fig. 6), and the combined downtime for all
pairs of connections from the same operators. Other oper-
ators and pairs are excluded from the graph for readability.
For comparison, we also plot the expected combined down-
time for connection pairs under the (false) assumption that
they fail independently. This value is calculated by multi-
plying the downtime rates of each connection, and serves as
a lower limit on the downtime we can expect by combining
operators.
We make two main observations. First, there is a large po-
tential for reducing downtime through multi-homing. 60%
of the nodes achieve 99.999% uptime when combining Te-
lenor and Tele2 connections; and 55% of the nodes achieve

the same when combining Netcom and Telenor connections.
