User: I am having some trouble with opening a .py file. I have a program that calls this .py file (i.e. pathname/example.py file.txt), but instead of running the python program, it opens it in Notepad. How to I get it to run?
The program itself takes in a file, and creates an output that is more readable.
Edit: The operating system is Windows 7. And the file that is calling the python is a .bat file.
Edit 2: It looks like I had to reinstall python for some reason... but it looks like it is finally working. Why reinstalling never comes to mind in the first place... And then I had to change how the file extention was opened. Thanks guys
Assistant: okay.
1) i tried turning it off and on again. 
2) i uninstalled and reinstalled python
still no joy.  and then!  
in windows explorer there's an open with option that sets the default program that windows is pointed toward if you click on the filename or enter it on the command line.  change that from notepad or whatever it is if it's not python.  change it to python.  then presto. no problem-o.
