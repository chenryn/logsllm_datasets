We described the inherent vulnerabilities of
mobile devices in MANETs and several attacks pos-
sible on such devices. We presented related work in
this area and presented the design and implementa-
tion of our secure routing protocol SecAODV and
IDS. The IDS is routing protocol
independent,
though in this case we have used SecAODV for
routing. The role of the routing protocols is just
to create and maintain routes. Even after protecting
the network from routing disruption attacks, packet
mangling attacks and grey holes, denial-of-service
attacks that use MAC vulnerabilities to disrupt
communication are still possible. However such
attacks cannot be prevented at higher networking
layers, rather security mechanisms need to provided
in the MAC protocol itself.
Nodes can operate on their own, however for
propagating information on misbehaving nodes a
platform to enable collaboration for dissemination
of such IDS data is needed. The scope of a host-
based IDS deployed on a mobile device is limited
to its radio range. We are currently working on
implementing a collaborative IDS which will oﬀer
a collective response to misbehaving or intrusive
nodes. In addition to using thresholds, we are also
working on using signal strengths of neighboring
nodes for detecting misbehaving nodes. Potentially
an IDS may assume that a neighboring node is
dropping packets, when in fact, the node simply
moved out of range of the monitoring node. A
low signal strength will help determine the distance
of the neighboring node and thus help decide if a
node is misbehaving or has simply moved out of
range. Also it will be helpful in selection of nodes
to monitor and increase
scalability and
detection accuracy of the IDS. We are also looking
into the additional energy consumption require-
ments when using secure routing protocols such
as SecAODV and the eﬀect of larger header sizes
