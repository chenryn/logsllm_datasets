## Abstract
The public key infrastructure (PKI) is fundamental for ensuring the authenticity of online communications. It verifies a chain of certificates, but the final step in end-to-end authentication relies on users verifying that the website is what they expect. Users are expected to evaluate domain names, but various "domain impersonation" attacks threaten their ability to do so. If a user can be easily tricked into believing that `amazon.com-offers.com` is actually `amazon.com`, and if security indicators like a lock icon are present, users may believe they have a secure connection to Amazon.

In this study, we:
1. Introduce a new classification of impersonation attack called "target embedding," which embeds an entire target domain, unmodified, using one or more subdomains of the actual domain.
2. Conduct a user study to understand whether users fall for target embedding and compare its efficacy to other popular impersonation attacks (typosquatting, combosquatting, and homographs). We find that target embedding is the most effective against modern browsers.
3. Perform a longitudinal analysis using all HTTPS certificates collected by Censys to examine how target-embedding impersonation has evolved, who issues impersonating certificates, who hosts the domains, and where the economic choke-points are. We conclude with a discussion of counter-measures against this growing threat.

## Introduction
The public key infrastructure (PKI) provides mechanisms for users to verify with whom they are communicating online. The PKI ensures end-to-end authentication by verifying a website's certificate chain and checking for revocation. However, the final step in end-to-end authentication involves the user ascertaining the identity of the entity on the other side of the connection. Users typically rely on two pieces of information: security indicators (e.g., the lock icon) and the website's domain name.

While the security community encourages users to look for security indicators when sharing private information, user studies show that these indicators are often misinterpreted. There has been little research on whether users effectively evaluate domain names. For example, if users can be easily tricked into believing that `amazon.com-offers.com` is `amazon.com`, they might believe they have a secure connection to Amazon, even with the presence of a lock icon.

This paper makes three broad contributions:
1. **A new classification of domain impersonation**: We introduce "target embedding," a form of impersonation that embeds an unmodified target domain using one or more subdomains of the actual domain.
2. **A user study of susceptibility to domain impersonation**: We conducted a user study to compare the effectiveness of target embedding with other impersonation attacks (typosquatting, combosquatting, and homographs).
3. **A wide-scale longitudinal study of target embedding**: We analyze all HTTPS certificates collected by Censys to understand the prevalence, issuance, hosting, and economic aspects of target embedding.

## Background and Related Work
### Domain Impersonation Attacks
Various forms of domain impersonation attacks have been identified, including:
- **Typosquatting**: Domains with a small edit distance from the target (e.g., `youtueb.com`).
- **Bitsquatting**: Flipped bits in the ASCII representation (e.g., `fagebook.com`).
- **Combosquatting**: Domains that include a target’s brand name alongside other string tokens (e.g., `facebook-login.com`).
- **Homographs**: Domains that use confusable characters, often Unicode, to mimic the target (e.g., `faceb00k.com`).
- **Homophones**: Domains that sound the same as the target when read aloud (e.g., `fasebook.com`).

These attacks typically occur in the effective second-level domain (e2LD). We introduce "e2LD spoofing" to describe attacks that generate a domain with a new e2LD, impersonating a similar-looking e2LD.

### Target Embedding
Target embedding is a new form of impersonation that embeds a complete, unmodified target domain, including the top-level domain (TLD), using one or more subdomains of the actual domain. For example, `www.facebook.com.user-29de84ca4bfa72.tk` embeds `facebook.com` within the subdomains of `user-29de84ca4bfa72.tk`. Unlike other impersonation attacks, target embedding operates outside the e2LD and requires at least one subdomain.

### User Perception and Comprehension of URLs
Research has shown that some users do look at the address bar to evaluate a website's legitimacy. Education efforts to make users consider the address bar have been effective, but users still struggle with identifying impersonation techniques. Our user study complements this work by measuring the effectiveness of different types of domain impersonation.

## Do Users Fall for Target Embedding?
To motivate our study, we performed a user study with 244 participants to understand how thoroughly users fall for target embedding compared to other impersonation attacks (typosquatting, combosquatting, and homographs).

### Study Design
Participants were presented with 48 questions, each showing a URL and the name of an organization, and asked to answer "Yes" or "No" to the question: "Do you believe that this is the organization’s URL?" This approach raises suspicion and draws attention to the address bar, potentially capturing a lower bound of users' susceptibility to impersonation attacks.

### Results
- **Target embedding** led to the second-highest number of mistakes (428), after homographs (480). It was significantly more effective than combosquatting (279), typosquatting (185), and Punycode (66).
- **Punycode** was extremely effective in mitigating homograph attacks, with participants significantly less likely to fall for Punycoded domains.
- **Target embedding** is currently the greatest threat, leading to more user mistakes than any other impersonation attack possible in modern browsers.

### Implications on the Web’s PKI
Our results highlight the need for better defenses against target embedding in the PKI. Potential solutions include improved user education, enhanced browser warnings, and stricter certificate issuance policies.

## Conclusion
This study introduces target embedding, a new form of domain impersonation, and demonstrates its effectiveness through a user study and longitudinal analysis. We provide insights into the prevalence and economic aspects of target embedding and discuss potential counter-measures to mitigate this growing threat.
