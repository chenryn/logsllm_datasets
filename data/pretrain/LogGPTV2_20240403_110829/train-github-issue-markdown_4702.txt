As requested here I'm filing a bug report for the following test case:
    $ cat hosts
    ---
    - group: all
      hosts:
      - host: 10.120.137.188:23000
      - host: 10.120.137.188:23001
    $ ansible all -i ./hosts -m shell -a uptime
    10.120.137.188:23000 | FAILED => FAILED: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
    10.120.137.188:23001 | FAILED => FAILED: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
