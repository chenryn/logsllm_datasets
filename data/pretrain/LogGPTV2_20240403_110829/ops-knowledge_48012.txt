User: Given a text file containing tens of thousands of domain names, please design a fast algorithm to check whether the same domain name exists in it.
Assistant: A possible solution is as follows: 1. Read in all the domain names in the text file and store them in a hash table. When storing, the domain name is used as the key, and the value does not need to be set. 2. For each new domain name, query it as a key in the hash table. If the key already exists, the domain name is a duplicate; otherwise, it is stored in the hash table. To avoid hash collisions, solutions such as chained hash tables or open addressable hash tables can be used. 3. For large-scale text files, the file can be divided into small blocks, and each block is processed in a similar way. At the end, multiple hash tables are merged to check for duplicate domain names that span different blocks. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) (where n is the number of domain names), so it can process very large datasets quickly and efficiently. At the same time, due to the adoption of a hash table, a small memory space is required to store data.
