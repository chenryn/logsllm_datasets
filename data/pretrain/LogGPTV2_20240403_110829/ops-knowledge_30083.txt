Assistant: This log chunk shows two tasks (1198 and 1199) being assigned and run, a broadcast variable being read and stored in memory, and five blocks being found locally. Additionally, the File Output Committer Algorithm version is 1 and the PythonRunner is reporting total, boot, init, and finish times.
