Hopefully you can see a demonstration here, although it may depend on your
browser font sizes: http://jsbin.com/hofeg/2/edit

If the tooltip appears too close to the edge of the container, then the
browser reshapes it to stay inside the container. Tooltip doesn't properly
account for this change in size.
It seems to attempt to; at the end of applyPlacement it tried to reposition
the arrow:
    this.replaceArrow(arrowDelta, $tip[0][arrowOffsetPosition], arrowPosition)
Before this line, the arrow is actually in the right place. After it, the
arrow has moved to somewhere behind the tooltip, so it's not visible.
