[Stack Overflow - Matplotlib Won't Plot Line of Same X-Values](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16999586/matplotlib-wont-plot-line-of-same-x-values/17000144?noredirect=1#comment24658630_17000144)

The issue at hand is that when a graph with a single horizontal line is generated, the line does not appear in Google Chrome. However, the line is visible in Adobe Illustrator and Internet Explorer. 

Interestingly, as soon as the line deviates from being perfectly straight, it becomes visible in all browsers. This behavior is distinct from the known issue where vertical or horizontal lines may disappear due to zooming or refreshing.
