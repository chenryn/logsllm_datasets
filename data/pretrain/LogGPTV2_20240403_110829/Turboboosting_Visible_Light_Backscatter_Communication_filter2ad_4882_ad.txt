5.5 Size Tradeoff
In our ViTag implementation, we dedicate two-thirds of the area to
solar cell and one-third to retroreflector. It is natural to ask: is this
ratio the right choice or even the golden rule?
From Tab. 2, we observe that in the process of a query, peak
power happens in the receiving state. In addition, the passive na-
ture of PassiveVLC determines that the receiving phase is ahead
of the backscattering phase, which results in a more challenging
requirement for energy harvesting. For instance, in the case of
0.25 kbps, the power provided by solar panel needs to meet the re-
quirement of the peak power (373 µW ) instead of the (much lower)
average power (97 µW ).
Our measurements show that in the dark chamber, the LED
flashlight casts 240 lux at the solar panel from a distance of 5 m
away. In turn, one single solar cell (at the size of 54 × 27 mm) is able
to provide 196 µW at 1.98 V . Therefore, the two cells we use are
able to provide 392 µW to cover the required energy consumption.
Note that this energy harvesting measurement is conservative –
the ambient light intensity is often larger than 200 lux and thus
more energy can be harvested for powering ViTag. To this end, our
experimental measurements justify the ratio in our prototype.
Furthermore, the aforementioned scenario assumes a continuous
communication is required. If the communication process can be
intermittent, then the power requirements can be relaxed because
in practice it just takes the solar panel more time to harvest the
energy to reach the operating voltage.
6 LINK BUDGET ANALYSIS
Much like the link budget analysis on RF links [7], it is desirable
to perform similar analysis for PassiveVLC to understand the re-
lationship and trade-off among the involved key factors such as
device’s form-factor size, transmitted power of the illuminating
infrastructure and the communication distance. For instance, when

our ViReader is integrated into car’s headlight for the purpose of
recognizing road sign or pedestrian at least 30 m away, what’s
the required minimum size of ViTag? As another example, when
a ViReader-enabled ceiling light wants to talk to the IoT devices
placed in indoor environments, what is the suggested transmission
power of the lighting infrastructure? Intuitively, a small increase in
range will lead to a significant increase in path loss. To compensate
for that, one simple solution is to adopt a larger retroreflector-LCD
suite to concentrate more energy for the uplink budget. However,
a larger LCD comes with more energy consumption, and in turn
needs a larger solar panel. Hence, a systematic analysis would
provide insights for guiding real application deployment.
For a retroreflector-based visible light backscatter communica-
tion system with LCD modulators, we propose a model (with all
the parameter definition in Tab. 3) to count in the transmission
power of the light source and all the factors of the gains and losses
from the transmitter and the visible channel medium (downlink,
retroreflector, LCD, etc.). The energy received by the photodiodes
of ViReader is as follows:
Pr = Pt Gt

4πR2 Gr e Lm

In this equation, there are six factors contributing to the two
critical phases which we will elaborate in the rest of this section.
6.1 Power budget of Passive/Retro Transmitter
The transmission power of the uplink actually originates from
ViReader-Tx. The radiated on-path light energy is determined by
Pt and Gt (θ ) (transmission power and directional characteristics of
the light source) often modeled by Lambertian model [9]. In other
words, these two factors together indicate how strong the downlink
light beam is emitted towards the ViTag.
The third factor characterizes the downlink path loss and how
much energy can be collected by the retroreflector of area Ar e at
a distance of R from ViReader-Tx, which is similar to Friis free
space equation in radio propagation. In our case, thanks to its
energy concentration property (Fig. 2), a larger retroreflector can
harvest more energy for backscattering and thus improve the SNR
of the received signal and potentially increase the communication
distance. However, we note that it is not always practical to reply
on increasing the retroreflector’s area to extend the distance. The
linearity can be easily overwhelmed by the square factor in power
attenuation, let alone the attenuation factor becomes quadratic
when considering the uplink together.
6.2 Path Loss of Retrocommunication
The first three factors compute the amount of energy captured by
ViTag. The next step is to determine how much the backscattered
energy can reach at the photodiodes or light sensor in ViReader-Rx.
Typical omni-directional antenna has relatively low directional
gain because the energy disperses in all directions. However, thanks
to the auto-focus feature of retroreflectors, it is possible to meet
both high gain and wide angular range at the same time. Gr e,
the directional gain of the retroreflector, plays a key role here.
To be more specific, Gr e is equal to RA (α, β ), the retroreflection
coefficient of the material, which determines how much energy it
can concentrate for retroreflection given the incident light beam at
a certain incidence angle β, to a certain observation angle (towards
to the light sensor) α, deviated from the incident light. 2 While
α is determined by the communication distance once the relative
position of led and photodiode is fixed, β is directly associated
with how flexible the orientation of ViTag can be when point to
ViReader. For visible light backscatter systems, it is desired to have
such material with a high RA and it is insensitive to β at the same
time. For the commodity retroreflectors [1] we use, it has an RA
of 500 cd· lx−1· m−2 (β = 5 ◦, α = 0.2 ◦), which leads to a Gr e of
27 dBi. In addition, RA only attenuates 5 dB as β reaches to 40 ◦.
Our evaluation shows that at β = 60 ◦, the gain is still sufficient to
support an uplink transmission in 1 m. On the other hand, when
β is fixed, RA stays high only within a small α (typically less than
1 ◦) and attenuates sharply as α rises above 1.5 ◦. In Fig. 15, we
show the illustration of the energy distribution of the reflected in
gray scale. The resulting concentrated and narrow reflected beam
suggested the placement of the light sensor is crucial in improving
the SNR of the uplink.
Lm, the energy loss when light passes through the LCD modula-
tor, also impacts the backscattered signal strength. In our system,
the incidence light will pass through the LCD twice, before and
after the retroreflection. Due to the polarizing nature of the LCD
[2], a beam of non-polarized light becomes polarized after pass-
ing through and lost 50% power. Coupled with other factors (such

vation angle of about 1.5 ◦.

positives in RFID’s case.
To evaluate the usability of PassiveVLC system in such scenario,
we mount our ViReader prototype on the ceiling at 2 m in front
of a door with a dip angle of 40 ◦ to ensure a 0.5 m of working
range on the floor derived from the analysis of ground projection
of the light cone. The number of 0.5 m is chosen to account for both
PassiveVLC’s response time (225 ms) and human walking speed (1
m/s). We ask five male and female subjects to wear our ViTag badge
at different height (1, 1.05, 1.1, 1.15, 1.2 m) and head up towards the
door at their natural walking speed. We count a test “successful” as
ViReader is able to receive the ViTag’s response without issuing
retries. We conduct 100 tests in total and our experimental results
show PassiveVLC achieve 90% of success rate.
7.2 Optical IoT/Sensor Networking
The second use case we present is optical IoT/sensor networking.
Home/office sensors (motion, temperature, humidity et al.) can be
integrated into ViTag and their sensory readings can be streamed to
a ViReader-capable lighting LED infrastructure. PassiveVLC brings
two benefits in this scenario: Firstly, it reduces the deployment
cost because of its battery-free property. Secondly, it avoids the
interference with other existing RF-based devices.
We instrument a wide FoV ceiling lamp of with our ViReader
and place 1 to 5 ViTags in different locations (table, chair, TV, etc.)
but still within ViReader’s view. Each ViTag is assigned a unique ID
and will response to ViReader’s ID-based interrogation with 4-byte
sensor data. The time to finish polling all the present ViTags are
0.225, 0.45, 0.675, 0.9 and 1.125 sec when 1 to 5 ViTags deployed
respectively. We observe this “perfect” linearity because PassiveVLC
is not running any operating system and thus all the operations
can be scheduled into cycles precisely. We note that a complete
PassiveVLC polling system requires a scanning/initialization phase
as well as a MAC protocol, which we leave for future work.
8 DISCUSSION
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS). Due to the directional propagation
property of light, PassiveVLC gains certain intrinsic security benefit
such as sniff-proof, but it also suffers from an intrinsic limitation -
it cannot work in NLoS situations, as any VLC system does.
Data Rate. The data rate or response time of PassiveVLC is doomed
by the LCD shutter’s turn-over rate, which may further limit its ap-
plication to those low data rate IoT applications. There are several
handy ways to improve the data rate to some extent. For exam-
ple, instead of using a black-white LCD, color LCDs can be used
to enable more communication channels. Accordingly, color fil-
ters should be added on the receiver side to distinguish different
channels. As another example, one can use a plural of retroflectors
and LCD shutters to achieve almost linearly increasing data rate,
as evidenced in [41]. We further believe, once the technology is
widely adopted, the market demand will stimulate the production
of faster LCD shutters. Finally, devices other than LCD, e.g., digital
micromirror device (DMD) can be treated as a promising modulator
candidate – it can achieve tens of kbps with 100 mW power budget

as absorption of liquid crystal), our measurements show that the
power loss for the first time passing through the LCD is approxi-
mately 65%. The case of the second time is much more complicated
because the retroreflector may change the polarization direction
of the light, and it is challenging to measure the loss because the
incident and outgoing light beams overlap in space. We estimate
this loss as 50%3 and thus Lm is approximately -7.6 dB. In addition,
Lm also is also relevant to the data rate because when the LCD
(dis)charging time is reduced, the amplitude of the modulated signal
is “attenuated”as well. In our measurements, compared with the
case of 0.25 kbps, the extra loss at a rate of 0.5 kbps and 1.0 kbps
is 7.7 dB and 20.4 dB respectively. Note that this measurement is
based on our ViReader-Rx module, and thus it includes the impact
of the variant frequency response in our circuit implementation
when ViTag operates at different data rate.
We have conducted several controlled experiments to verify our
analysis. First, we change the area of retroreflector Ar e and fix
other parameters. The results shown in Fig. 16(a) demonstrate that
received signal strength (square of the ADC voltage reading) is
linearly proportional to Ar e with R2 of 0.9886. Next, we fix Ar e
and change the communication distance R and plot the results
in Fig. 16(b). We make a linear fit of the received signal strength
and the distance in log scale. The results show that the received
signal strength is inversely proportional to 4.6th power of the dis-
tance, which fits our model well with R2 of 0.9953. Note that our
measurement starts at 1.2 m because the ADC is saturated from
a closer location. However, PassiveVLC can still work at the dis-
tance of [0.6,1.2] m as long as we operate the average voltage when
trend-based modulation is applied away from the saturation region.
7 PROOF-OF-CONCEPT APPLICATIONS
We evaluate two proof-of-concept applications to show how Pas-
siveVLC applies to real world scenarios.
7.1 Smart Check-in System
Most existing smart check-in systems use RFID card, fingerprint or
iris based identification techniques which requires a user in prox-
imity. We argue that when bearing with ViTag a badge, PassiveVLC
users can potentially enjoy a seamless experience when passing
by different check-in points – a ViReader-enabled door will auto-
matically grant the access when a authenticated PassiveVLC user
