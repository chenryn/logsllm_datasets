Question: "An application is deployed in multiple environments: development, testing, and production. Each environment requires different database credentials, API keys, and service URIs. The developer has implemented a configuration file. Evaluate the following configurations and select the instances that would lead to the weakness described as using an invariant value in dynamically changing contexts."
 "A": "The configuration file includes a section for each environment, with environment-specific values for each setting."
 "B": "Database credentials are hardcoded in the application source code and are the same for all environments."
 "C": "API keys are loaded from environment variables that are set differently on each deployment environment."
 "D": "A service URI defined as 'http://localhost/service' is used for service calls, regardless of the deployment environment."
