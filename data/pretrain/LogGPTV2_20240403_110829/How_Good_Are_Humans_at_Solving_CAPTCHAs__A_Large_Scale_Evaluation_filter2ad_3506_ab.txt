IMAGE CAPTCHA FEATURES
ebay.com consist of six letters in a dark color on a white
background. To obfuscate the text, individual characters are
randomly tilted, shifted up and down and placed so as to
overlap one another.
Microsoft.
Google.
Google.com is a popular search engine that provides many
other services, such as webmail. Image captchas from
google.com consist of a white background with red, green
or blue lettering that forms a pseudo-word – a sequence of
characters that could probably be an English word, but isn’t
– of four to ten lowercase letters. To obfuscate the text,
characters are squeezed, tilted and moved so that they touch
each other, and the character sequence is arranged in a wave.
Mail.ru.4
Live.com is the server for Windows Live IDs,
the user
accounts for Hotmail, MSN Messenger, Xbox LIVE, and
other Microsoft sites. Image captchas from live.com consist
of eight dark blue digits and uppercase letters on a gray
background. To obfuscate the text, characters are squeezed,
tilted and moved so that they touch each other, and the
sequence is arranged in a wave.
Recaptcha.
Recaptcha.net provides image captchas to a large number
of high proﬁle sites, such as Facebook, Ticketmaster, and
Craigslist. Captchas from recaptcha.net consist of two words
(roughly 5-20 characters, according to the captcha answers
we collected) in black on a white background. To obfuscate
the text, the words are drawn from scanned books, where op-
tical character recognizers failed on at least one of the words.
Additionally, the characters of both words are squeezed into
a wave-like shape.
Skyrock.
Mail.ru is the biggest free Russian webmail provider. Image
captchas from mail.ru consist of six blue outlines of letters
and numbers on a white background. To obfuscate the text,
characters are tilted, bent, moved up and down, and the entire
background is covered with hundreds of other outlines of
letters and numbers.
4The Mail.ru captcha is scaled at 0.5
Skyrock.com is a social network and blogging site that is
popular in many French speaking countries. Image captchas
from skyrock.com consist of ﬁve to six dark colored digits
and lowercase letters on a lighter colored background. To
obfuscate the text,
the characters are squeezed and the
sequence is arranged in a wave.

B. Audio captchas
When available for the sites presented above, we also
collected their audio captchas. As a result we also studied
the following 8 audio captcha schemes.
Authorize.
Slashdot.org is a website with user-submitted and editor-
evaluated current affairs news, accompanied by forum-style
comments. Image captchas from slashdot.org consist of a
single English word of six to eight lower case letters in
black on a white background. To obfuscate the text, some
characters are ﬁlled while others are only outlines, a number
of zig-zag lines are drawn over all the letters, and small black
dots spot the background.
Blizzard.5
WorldOfWarcraft.com is the website for the popular online
game World of Warcraft (WoW), run by Blizzard Enter-
tainment. Image captchas from worldofwarcraft.com consist
of six to eight bright colored letters on a darker patterned
background. To obfuscate the text, characters are slightly
tilted, squeezed and shifted up and down.
Yahoo.6
Audio captchas on authorize.net consist of a female voice
speaking aloud each of the ﬁve letters or digits of the image
captcha. The voice clearly articulates each character, and
there is minimal distortion. The example waveform and
spectrogram are 3 second clips including the letters Q, 5
and V. These show that a good pause appears between
each spoken character, and that the vowel formants (the
thick black waves in the middle of the spectrogram, which
are good indicators of both vowels and the surrounding
consonants) are clearly visible in each word.
Digg.
Yahoo.com is a popular search engine, portal and webmail
provider. Image captchas from yahoo.com consist of ﬁve to
eight black digits and upper or lowercase letters on a white
background. To obfuscate the text, characters are squeezed,
bent and moved so that they touch each other, and the
character sequence is arranged in a wave.
5The Blizzard captcha is scaled at 0.75
6The Yahoo captcha is scaled at 0.75
Audio captchas on digg.com consist of a female voice
speaking aloud ﬁve letters. There is heavy white noise
in the background, and sometimes an empty but louder
segment is played between letters. The example waveform
and spectrogram are 3 second clips including the letters N,
L and an empty louder segment. The overall darkness of the
spectrogram shows the heavy white noise which somewhat
obscures the vowel formants.

AUDIO CAPTCHA FEATURES
interjected. The example waveform and spectrogram are 3
second clips containing the words “zero”, “it” and “oh” at
the beginning, middle and end of the segment. The spec-
togram shows how similar the formants from the background
noise look to the true vowel formants, and of the three largest
amplitude wave groups in the waveform, only the ﬁrst and
the last are actual words.
Note that because of the difﬁculty of this captcha, we
were unable to say with conﬁdence how many digits were
presented, or even that the captcha was supposed to consist
only of digits. Thus, the entries in Table II for Google are
estimated from the answers we collected from our human
subjects.

eBay.
Audio captchas on ebay.com consist of the same six digits
from the image captcha being spoken aloud, each by a differ-
ent speaker in a different setting. The example waveform and
spectrogram are 3 second clips containing the digits 6, 0, 7,
7 and 7 - note that the digits in these captchas are delivered
much faster than those of authorize.net or digg.com. The
waveform shows the variability of the various digits due to
different speakers and different background noise levels, and
the spectrogram shows that the vowel formants are short and
often obscured by the noise.
Google.
Audio captchas on live.com consist of ten digits being
spoken aloud, each by a different speaker over a low quality
recording, with various voices playing simultaneously in the
background. The example waveform and spectrogram are 3
second clips containing the digits 1, 4, 6, 5 and 0 - like the
eBay audio captchas, these digits are delivered quite fast
to the user. While all the high amplitude sections of the
waveform correspond to the actual digits, the spectrogram
shows that the vowel formants are somewhat obscured by
the background noise.
Audio captchas on google.com consist of three beeps, a
male voice speaking digits aloud, the phrase “once again”,
and a repeat of the male voice speaking the digits. In the
background, various voices are playing simultaneously, and
confusing decoy words like “now” or “it” are occasionally
404
Recaptcha.
Yahoo.
Audio captchas from recaptcha.net consist of eight digits
spoken by different speakers, with voices in the background
and occasional confusing words interjected. This is similar to
the live.com presentation, but the digits are delivered much
more slowly - the 3 second clip in the example waveform
and spectrogram includes only the digit 6 and a confusing
“eee” sound, with the next actual digit following about a
second after the end of this clip7.
Slashdot.
Audio captchas from slashdot.org consists of a single word
spoken aloud, followed by the same word spelled letter by
letter. The speech is generated by a text-to-speech system,
with a computer-generated male voice. The example wave-
form and spectrogram are the entire 3 second clip containing
Leathers, L, E, A, T, H, E, R and S. The spectrogram shows
that the vowel formants are very clear (not surprsing, as they
were computer-generated), though the speed of the letter-
spelling speech in these captchas is among the fastest of all
the audio captchas we surveyed.
7We used the default version supplied by the PHP API, but the recaptcha
webpage suggests they also have another audio captcha scheme based on
spoken words
405
Audio captchas from yahoo.com consist of three beeps and
then a child’s voice speaking seven digits with various other
child voices in the background. The example waveform
and spectrogram are a 3 second clip containing the digits
7 and 8. The digits are the largest amplitude sections
on the waveform, though the spectrogram shows that the
background voices look very much like the “real” speech.
IV. REAL WORLD USAGE : EBAY DATA
Before testing humans on our corpus of captchas, we ﬁrst
gathered some information about how captchas are used
in the wild. With our collaborators at eBay, we gathered
statistics on how captchas were used on their site over the
course of a week in 2009, as shown in Table IV. Over the
course of a week, eBay provided nearly 14 000 000 captchas
to its users. Of these, over 200 000 were failed, suggesting
that an average eBay user answers their captchas correctly
98.5% of the time. Thus, in our study, we would expect to
see our subjects with captcha solving accuracies in roughly
this range.
Another interesting aspect of the eBay statistics is the
usage of audio captchas. Of the 14 000 000 captchas, more
than 100 000 were audio captchas, indicating that 0.77% of
the time, users prefer to have audio captchas over image
