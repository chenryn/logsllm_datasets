ASes or preﬁxes is tricky, especially because we do not have a pri-
ori knowledge about their signature in terms of ASes and preﬁxes.
Indeed, some of these clusters might very well be present in a sin-
gle location but for administrative reasons split their infrastructure
into multiple ASes or use multiple preﬁxes due to multi-homing.
One known example is Rapidshare [8], that relies on multiple ASes
and preﬁxes yet whose facility is a single data-center.
Therefore, we estimate the number of countries in which a host-

Number of ASN for infrastructure
(Number of clusters in parenthesis)
Figure 6: Country-level diversity of content infrastructure
clusters.
ing infrastructure cluster is present based on geolocation informa-
tion. For each cluster we check onto how many countries it is de-
ployed. Figure 6 shows the resulting relationship in the form of a
stacked bar-plot. On the x-axis, we show the number of ASes in
which clusters are discovered. We annotate the number of different
clusters found for a given number of ASes in parenthesis. On the
y-axis, we show the fraction of clusters whose preﬁxes are located
in a given number of countries (see legend).
As shown in Figure 6, most of the hosting infrastructure clusters
that use a single AS are present in a single country. As a cluster’s
footprint is on more ASes, the likelihood that it is present in multi-
ple countries increases. At the same time, a signiﬁcant fraction of
hosting infrastructure clusters using multiple ASes are located in a
single country. Because of the limited number of content infrastruc-
ture clusters located in 5 or more ASes (33 clusters), the fraction
for these clusters in Figure 6 simply reﬂects a few instances of par-
ticular hosting infrastructures. Most of these clusters are present in
several countries, thus, are probably CDNs.
4.2.4
Summary
In this section, we used our clustering algorithm to identify host-
ing infrastructures based on network features. We validate our clas-
siﬁcation based on additional information for two large CDNs. We
present evidence of how Akamai and Google slice up their host-
ing infrastructures for different hosting purposes, and show which
content is hosted on which hosting infrastructures. We distinguish
between smaller hosting infrastructures based on both their features
and their geographic deployment. We ﬁnd a relationship between
the number of ASes on which a hosting infrastructure is present
and the multiplicity of its locations, giving a hint about their de-
ployment strategy.
4.3 Mapping Hosting Infrastructures
To ﬁnd out the geographic location of the hot-spots that serve
most hostnames from our list, we compute both content potentials
on a per country basis. Table 4 shows the results for both poten-

tials. Note, for the USA only, we provide the state level. The lines
of Table 4 are ranked by decreasing normalized content delivery
potential and show the top 20 hosting infrastructures.
Despite the division into states, the USA leads the ranking with
its hosting infrastructure in California. Indeed, in total 9 US states
are among the top 20. On the second place we ﬁnd China. Di-
rectly comparing California with China reveals that China’s deliv-
ery potential is a lot lower than California’s, yet the values of their
normalized potential are quite close. Comparing China’s poten-
tial with its normalized potential indicates that a large fraction of
the content served from China is only available in China. In total,
China and California together count for over 23 % of hostnames
of our list in the normalized potential. Besides USA and China, 7
European countries are among the top 20, as well as Japan, Aus-
tralia and Canada.
In total we see content being delivered from
122 countries/US states, or 77 countries. The top 20 countries/US
states presented here are responsible for 70 % of all hostnames in
our study.
4.4 Revisiting AS Rankings
Geographic hot-spots are insightful in that they reﬂect where
large chunks of the hosting infrastructures are. However, they pro-
vide little insight to understand how content is delivered to Internet
users. Therefore, we investigate where content resides at the AS-
level.
To map hosting infrastructure clusters to ASes, we rely on the
same approach as in Section 4.2.3. For each cluster, we take the
preﬁxes from which it serves content, and map each preﬁx to an AS
number using BGP data. This gives us a set of AS numbers for each
cluster. Recall that a hosting infrastructure cluster is deﬁned by a
set of hostnames it serves. We reuse the notion of content delivery
potential, as introduced in Section 2.4, but where “locations” are
now ASes. The content delivery potential of an AS is the fraction
of hostnames it can potentially serve from all the clusters that are
hosted on this AS.
Figure 7 provides the top 20 ASes in terms of their content de-
livery potential. Unexpectedly, we ﬁnd mostly ISPs in this top 20.
Note that the CMI (cf. Section 2.4) is very low for all the top ranked
ASes. The two genuine content hosters in the list are Akamai and
Bandcon. There are two main factors explaining the unexpected top
