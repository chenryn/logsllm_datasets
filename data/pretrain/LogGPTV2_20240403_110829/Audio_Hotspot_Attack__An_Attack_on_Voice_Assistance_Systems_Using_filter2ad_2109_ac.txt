SPL ranging from 45 dB(A) to 78 dB(A) (the maximum SPL
for the dynamic speaker). the common environmental noise
levels are shown in [27]. To calculate the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), we use the following formula Eq. 7 [28]
SNR [dB] = SPL of sound [dB] − SPL of noise [dB]
(7)
We use the sound level meter to measure the SPL of voice
command and noise. Figure 8 shows the results. For both
devices, the attack was most successful when the noise SNR
was over than 0 [dB], i.e., when the input command and
noise have the same volumes. Activation voice commands
were more tolerant of noise. This observation agrees with
those previously-described in Section 5.1.
5.2.2 Nonstationary noise
We evaluate noise tolerance in an environment that has non-
stationary noise. As nonstationary noise, we adopt babble
noise. We used the room dedicated for acoustic experiments.
We chose three types of noise settings: Default, Speech
Blocker, and Chic dinner, which are taken from Ref. [29].
These noise types contain conversations in English. We
summarize the results in Figure 9. We attempt to input the
voice command 10 times in each setup. For both devices,
the attack was successful when SNR was -5 [dB] and over.
When the SNR is 0 [dB], i.e., when the volumes of input
command and noise are same, attacks sometimes failed. In
other cases, these results follow the observation of Fig 8.
5.3 Impact of voice commands
To study the impact of voice commands, various commands
are inputted into the target devices. In this experiment, the
distance between the parametric loudspeaker and the target
devices was ﬁxed at 1.5 m. Again, the output audible SPL

from the parametric loudspeaker was ﬁxed to 60 dB(A). The attack was
most successful when the SNR was larger than 0 [dB].

tion of Fig 8.
of the parametric loudspeaker was set to 60 dB(A). Each
command was tested 10 times.
Table 3 shows the results. As indicates by the results, the
attack success rate was high for commands of short lengths.
We note that although the lengths of these commands were
short, they can be used for malicious purposes; for example,
by starting with the recognition command “Set volume 0,”
an attacker can improve the probability of success for the
next attacks as a voice response from the device will not
be heard by a nearby person. The attacker can also turn IoT
devices on/off. If this device is a piece of heating equipment,
considerable physical damage is possible. In contrast, for
longer commands, the attack success rate was low.
We conjecture that there are several reasons behind this
observation, e.g., the occurrences of infrequent words or
the accumulation of recognition errors. These results agree
with [6], who showed that longer commands, emitted as
ultrasounds, were prone to failure.

Fig. 10. Overview of the experimental setup. Left: user study of the linear
attack in the acoustic room. Right: user study of the cross attack in the
acoustic room. We use four dynamic speakers to adjust the noise level.
5.4 Evaluation of the cross attack
To perform the cross attack, the AM sound wave was sep-
arated into the carrier wave and the lower sideband wave
using MATLAB [30]. The two sound waves were ampliﬁed
and emitted through the two parametric loudspeakers. The
ampliﬁers were adjusted so that the SPL of the audible
sound was at its maximum at the target area (center of the
room). The average SPL of audible sound was 42.7 dB(A).
The cross attack was tested by changing the position of
the target device, as shown in Figure 10 (Right). In the
ﬁgure, the blue circles indicate measurement points, where
a sound level meter was set. Two parametric loudspeakers
were set so that they would cross at the center point. Unlike
the linear attack setup, this setup was not symmetrical and
each parametric loudspeaker transmitted a different signal
(i.e., a carrier wave and a sideband wave, respectively). We
established 5×5 = 25 measurement points. As shown in the
ﬁgure, we installed four dynamic speakers to ﬁne-tune the
SPL of ambient room noise. We conﬁgured the directions
of the dynamic speakers such that noises were equally
distributed throughout the room. We ﬁxed the distance
between the target device and two parametric loudspeakers

2 m, and the SPL of noise was set to 43 dB(A).
At each position, the attack was repeated 10 times, with
the number of successes counted. Figure 11 shows the
results. The ﬁrst ﬁnding was that the attack was successful
only in the area targeted by the cross attack. Second, for
the activation voice command, the attack success was 100%
for both devices. Finally, although the success rate was low
for voice recognition (“what’s on my next schedule?”), it
remains a realistic threat, given the fact that an adversary
can repeat the attack until it succeeds.
5.5 Summary
Throughout this section, we evaluated attack feasibility.
First, the experiments demonstrated that the attacks were
successful over long distances. In the experiment room (500
cm × 500 cm), Google Home attacks were 100% successful at
350 cm and Amazon Echo attacks were more than 90% suc-
cessful at 150 cm. The hallway experiments demonstrated
that, for both devices, attacks were successful at distances
greater than 10 m. Second, we discovered that the attacks
were tolerant of environmental noise. For both devices, the
attack success rate remained high at a noise SPL of 60 dB(A).
This SPL corresponded to the SPL used for the experiments
described in Section 6. Finally, the attacks were successful
with various types and lengths of voice commands.
6 HUMAN STUDY EXPERIMENTS
In psychoacoustics, hearing is different from objective SPL
measurements [31]. We tested to conﬁrm whether the direc-
tional sound generated from parametric loudspeakers could
be perceived by humans around the targeted device. To
this end, we conducted extensive user study experiments
to answer the RQ3: “Is the attack stealthy for nearby people
and unrecognizable for them?” To complement the results
of our human studies (subjective evaluation), SPL measure-
ments were taken with the sound level meter (objective
evaluation).

6.1 Experimental setups
Figure 10 presents an overview of the experimental setup.
For the linear attack mode, both a parametric loudspeaker
and a dynamic speaker were used to observe their differ-
ences. In the ﬁgure, the blue circles indicate measurement
points, where a participant was seated. As the setup was
symmetric in nature, 3 × 5 = 15 measurement points were
set only in the right half. We omitted the left half to reduce
the workload of the participants without sacriﬁcing the gen-
erality of the results. The distance between the measurement
points was set to 1 m. For the cross attack, two parametric
loudspeakers were set so that they would cross at the center
point. We established 5×5 = 25 measurement points, with a
chair at each measurement point (See Appendix B, Figure 2).
The output power of the adversary’s parametric / dy-
namic loudspeakers was adjusted so that the SPL of the
audible sound (not the ultrasound) measured 3 m away
from the parametric loudspeaker was 60 dB(A). Accounting
for the inaudible sound wave, the total SPL was 120—130
dB(A) for all these settings. Finally, for the four dynamic
speakers that generate 1/f noise, we adjusted the output
power such that the audible SPL was 60 dB(A) at a distance
of 3 m. For reference, the SPLs of common environmental
noises are summarized in [27].
6.2 Human study overview
6.2.1 Participants
For the user study, we recruited 20 normal-hearing partici-
pants. Of these, 12 were female and eight were male, with
ages ranging from 19 to 27. Thus, the participants were
younger on average. Because younger people tend to have
better hearing, we selected a severe condition to evaluate
recognizability.
The participants consist of students at our university. We
let the participants choose the preferred language from the
two choices, Japanese and English. While 16 participants
who selected Japanese are all native speakers of Japanese,
other three participants who selected English were ﬂuent
in English but not necessary were the native speakers of
English. Two of them are from Indonesia and the other
is from China. For each participant, consent was obtained
before enrolment. All participants were informed that they
could quit the experiment whenever they desired. Other
ethical considerations are discussed in section 7.
6.2.2 Procedure
For each setup, each participant was ﬁrst directed to sit in
a chair set at the position marked with the star symbol in
Figure 10. Then, the height of loudspeaker(s) was adjusted
so that the participant’s sitting height matched the position
of the loudspeaker(s). For each participant, the heights and
angles of the speakers were ﬁxed throughout the experi-
ments. After the beginning of a session, a random word
is emitted twice from the speaker at a random moment
in time. A participant reports whether they recognize the
word. If they recognize it, they write down the word that
they recognized.
From the set of random words, those containing between
3 and 6 phonemes were selected. It was also ensured that
the words would be difﬁcult to predict beforehand, e.g.,
9
wake-up words typically used for voice assistance systems
were avoided. Each participant repeated the sessions after
moving to another chair.
To ensure the quality of the subjective evaluations, we
used a silent task with each participant. During the silent
task, no voice sounds were emitted. If a participant reported
that they heard something during the silent task, the other
results reported by the participant were considered unreli-
able and removed. Consequently, two participants’ results
were removed from the ﬁnal analyses.
6.2.3 Evaluation of recognizability
To quantify the recognizability reported by the participants,
we used a Jaccard index for the sets of letters in two
words t and r, which are a test word and a reported word,
respectively. For instance, if a test speech word is ‘fest’ and
the reported word is ‘test’, the Jaccard index is computed
as J(‘fest’, ‘test’) = 3/5 = 0.6. For reference, a randomly
sampled answer sheet reported by one of the participants is
shown in Appendix B.
In total, for each measurement point, we collected 18
scores reported by the 18 participants. At least one score for
each measurement point was In total, for each measurement
point, we collected 18 scores , reported by the 18 partici-
pants. At least one score for each measurement point was
omitted, as there was one silent task for each participant.
To quantify the recognizability, the average of the reported
scores was taken for each measurement point.
6.3 Results of the human study
Figure 12 shows the linear attack results. The heat maps
represent the average Jaccard index scores. Notably, for the
dynamic loudspeaker experiment, most participants suc-
cessfully recognized the test speech words across a wide
range. In fact, the test words were audible even behind the
speaker. On the other hand, for the parametric loudspeaker
experiment, the audible space was limited to a narrow area
(i.e., the direction of directional sound propagation). The
generated sound wave was somewhat inaudible over a short
range owing to the fact that the generated ultrasonic beam
moved forward before it was demodulated in the air.
Figure 13 shows the cross attack results. It is important
to note that there seem to be no audible spaces in the room.
However, as shown in the previous subsection 5.4, the cross
attack was successful in emitting malicious voice commands
to the voice assistance systems. This contradiction can be
explained as follows: as the cross point was limited to a
very narrow area, it did not “hear” the areas close to the
participant’s ears. Even if a participant was able to catch
either a carrier wave or a lower sideband wave, they would
not recognize them unless they caught both sound waves at
a cross point. To complement the results of the human study,
the results of the objective sound level meter evaluations are
presented in Figure 14.
6.4 Summary
In this section, we examined the recognizability of sounds
generated from parametric loudspeakers. For comparison,
we also examined the characteristics of the sound generated
by a dynamic speaker. Both the subjective and objective

[33], [34]. One possible method of overcoming this limi-
tation would be to install parametric loudspeaker(s) on a
ceiling, thus creating a “sound shower.” In fact, parametric
loudspeakers are often mounted on ceilings to make sounds
audible only at one point in the room, without the risk of
interruption form an obstacle. Even when it is unrealistic
to mount a parametric loudspeaker on the ceiling, it would
still be effective to place it at a raised or a side position to
ensure that the sound wave emitted avoids obstacles.
We used two smart speakers, Google Home and Amazon
Echo, as examples of popular devices with voice assistance
systems. Other types of voice assistance systems include
smartphones, in-car navigation systems, and commercially
available medical devices. Studying the effectiveness of the
Audio Hotspot Attack on most of these other devices will
be conducted in future studies; however, we did verify that
the attack worked on several smartphones. Although the
evaluation of the latter is not as thorough as that presented
in section 5, some results have been given in the Appendix
for reference.
Finally, although we sought to make these studies scien-
tiﬁcally reproducible, the target devices are updated regu-
larly. Furthermore, as the majority of the off-the-shelf voice
assistant devices today run the speech recognition on the
server side, it is prone to change over time. Therefore, once
changes are made to the hardware or software in the voice
assistance devices, other results may differ from the ones
we obtained. As off-the-shelf products are “black box” in
nature, it is difﬁcult to fully understand how input sound
waves are processed by the device’s hardware and/or soft-
ware. Therefore, to make the results of the experiments
to be invariable and reproducible, it would be desirable
to develop open-source hardware and software platforms,
