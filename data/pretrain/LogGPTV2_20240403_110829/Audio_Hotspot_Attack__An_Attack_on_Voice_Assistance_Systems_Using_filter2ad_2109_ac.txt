### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Environmental Noise

The sound pressure level (SPL) of the dynamic speaker ranges from 45 dB(A) to 78 dB(A), with 78 dB(A) being the maximum. Common environmental noise levels are detailed in [27]. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated using the following formula [28]:

\[ \text{SNR [dB]} = \text{SPL of sound [dB]} - \text{SPL of noise [dB]} \]

We used a sound level meter to measure the SPL of both the voice command and the ambient noise. Figure 8 presents the results. For both devices, the attack was most successful when the SNR was greater than 0 dB, indicating that the input command and noise had similar volumes. Activation voice commands were more tolerant of noise, which aligns with the observations in Section 5.1.

### Nonstationary Noise Evaluation

To assess noise tolerance in an environment with non-stationary noise, we used babble noise. The experiments were conducted in a room dedicated to acoustic tests. We selected three types of noise settings: Default, Speech Blocker, and Chic Dinner, as described in [29]. These noise types include English conversations. The results are summarized in Figure 9. We attempted to input the voice command 10 times in each setup. For both devices, the attack was successful when the SNR was -5 dB or higher. When the SNR was 0 dB, i.e., when the volumes of the input command and noise were equal, the attacks sometimes failed. In other cases, the results were consistent with those in Figure 8.

### Impact of Voice Commands

To study the impact of various voice commands, we inputted different commands into the target devices. The distance between the parametric loudspeaker and the target devices was fixed at 1.5 meters. The output audible SPL of the parametric loudspeaker was set to 60 dB(A). Each command was tested 10 times.

Table 3 shows the results. The attack success rate was high for short commands (2-5 words). Short commands, such as "Set volume 0," can be used for malicious purposes. For example, by setting the volume to zero, an attacker can prevent the device from producing any audible response, making subsequent attacks more likely to go undetected. Additionally, attackers can turn IoT devices on or off, potentially causing physical damage if the device controls heating equipment. In contrast, longer commands had a lower success rate, possibly due to infrequent words or accumulated recognition errors. These results are consistent with [6], which showed that longer ultrasonic commands are prone to failure.

### Cross Attack Evaluation

To perform the cross attack, the AM sound wave was separated into the carrier wave and the lower sideband wave using MATLAB [30]. The two sound waves were amplified and emitted through two parametric loudspeakers. The amplifiers were adjusted to maximize the SPL of the audible sound at the target area (center of the room). The average SPL of the audible sound was 42.7 dB(A).

The cross attack was tested by changing the position of the target device, as shown in Figure 10 (Right). Blue circles indicate measurement points where a sound level meter was placed. Two parametric loudspeakers were positioned to cross at the center point. Unlike the linear attack setup, this setup was asymmetrical, with each parametric loudspeaker transmitting a different signal (carrier wave and sideband wave, respectively). We established 25 measurement points (5x5 grid). Four dynamic speakers were installed to fine-tune the SPL of ambient room noise, ensuring even distribution. The distance between the target device and the two parametric loudspeakers was fixed at \( \sqrt{2} \) meters, and the SPL of noise was set to 43 dB(A).

At each position, the attack was repeated 10 times, and the number of successes was counted. Figure 11 shows the results. The attack was successful only in the targeted area. For activation voice commands, the attack success rate was 100% for both devices. Although the success rate for voice recognition ("what’s on my next schedule?") was low, it remains a realistic threat, as an adversary can repeat the attack until it succeeds.

### Summary of Experimental Results

Throughout this section, we evaluated the feasibility of the attacks. First, the experiments demonstrated that the attacks were successful over long distances. In the experiment room (500 cm × 500 cm), Google Home attacks were 100% successful at 350 cm, and Amazon Echo attacks were more than 90% successful at 150 cm. Hallway experiments showed that attacks were successful at distances greater than 10 meters. Second, the attacks were tolerant of environmental noise, with high success rates even at a noise SPL of 60 dB(A). Finally, the attacks were successful with various types and lengths of voice commands.

### Human Study Experiments

In psychoacoustics, hearing differs from objective SPL measurements [31]. We conducted extensive user studies to determine whether the directional sound generated by parametric loudspeakers could be perceived by humans near the targeted device. The goal was to answer RQ3: "Is the attack stealthy for nearby people and unrecognizable for them?" To complement the subjective evaluations, we also took SPL measurements using a sound level meter (objective evaluation).

#### Experimental Setups

Figure 10 provides an overview of the experimental setup. For the linear attack mode, both a parametric loudspeaker and a dynamic speaker were used. Blue circles indicate measurement points where participants were seated. The setup was symmetric, with 15 measurement points in the right half. The distance between the measurement points was 1 meter. For the cross attack, two parametric loudspeakers were positioned to cross at the center point, with 25 measurement points (5x5 grid) and a chair at each point (see Appendix B, Figure 2).

The output power of the parametric/dynamic loudspeakers was adjusted so that the SPL of the audible sound measured 3 meters away was 60 dB(A). The total SPL, including the inaudible sound wave, was 120-130 dB(A). For the four dynamic speakers generating 1/f noise, the output power was adjusted to achieve an audible SPL of 60 dB(A) at 3 meters. Common environmental noise levels are summarized in [27].

#### Participants and Procedure

We recruited 20 normal-hearing participants, 12 female and 8 male, aged 19 to 27. Participants were students at our university and could choose their preferred language (Japanese or English). All Japanese participants were native speakers, while the three English-speaking participants were fluent but not necessarily native speakers. Consent was obtained before enrollment, and participants were informed they could quit at any time.

Participants sat in chairs at the marked positions and the height of the loudspeakers was adjusted to match their sitting height. A random word was emitted twice from the speaker at a random moment. Participants reported whether they recognized the word and, if so, wrote it down. Words containing 3-6 phonemes and difficult to predict were chosen. Each participant repeated the sessions after moving to another chair.

To ensure the quality of the subjective evaluations, a silent task was included. If a participant reported hearing something during the silent task, their results were considered unreliable and removed. Two participants' results were excluded from the final analysis.

#### Evaluation of Recognizability

Recognizability was quantified using the Jaccard index for the sets of letters in the test word and the reported word. For example, if the test word was 'fest' and the reported word was 'test', the Jaccard index would be 3/5 = 0.6. For each measurement point, we collected 18 scores from the 18 participants, with one score omitted due to the silent task. The average Jaccard index was calculated for each measurement point.

#### Results of the Human Study

Figure 12 shows the linear attack results, with heat maps representing the average Jaccard index scores. For the dynamic loudspeaker, most participants recognized the test words across a wide range, even behind the speaker. For the parametric loudspeaker, the audible space was limited to a narrow area, with the sound wave becoming inaudible over a short range due to the forward movement of the ultrasonic beam before demodulation.

Figure 13 shows the cross attack results. There appear to be no audible spaces in the room, but the cross attack successfully emitted malicious voice commands. This contradiction can be explained by the fact that the cross point is very narrow and does not reach the areas close to the participant's ears. Even if a participant caught either the carrier wave or the lower sideband wave, they would not recognize the command unless both waves were caught at the cross point. Objective sound level meter evaluations are presented in Figure 14.

### Summary

This section examined the recognizability of sounds generated by parametric loudspeakers and compared them to dynamic speakers. Both subjective and objective evaluations were conducted. Parametric loudspeakers create a narrow, focused sound field, making the attack stealthy and unrecognizable to nearby people. Future studies will explore the effectiveness of the Audio Hotspot Attack on other devices, such as smartphones and in-car navigation systems. The results may vary with updates to the hardware and software of the target devices, and open-source platforms would be beneficial for reproducibility.
