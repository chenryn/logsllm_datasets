ABSTRACT
While trawling online/ofﬂine password guessing has been inten-
sively studied, only a few studies have examined targeted online
guessing, where an attacker guesses a speciﬁc victim’s password
for a service, by exploiting the victim’s personal information such
as one sister password leaked from her another account and some
personally identiﬁable information (PII). A key challenge for tar-
geted online guessing is to choose the most effective password can-
didates, while the number of guess attempts allowed by a server’s
lockout or throttling mechanisms is typically very small.
We propose TarGuess, a framework that systematically charac-
terizes typical targeted guessing scenarios with seven sound math-
ematical models, each of which is based on varied kinds of data
available to an attacker. These models allow us to design novel and
efﬁcient guessing algorithms. Extensive experiments on 10 large
real-world password datasets show the effectiveness of TarGuess.
Particularly, TarGuess I(cid:24)IV capture the four most representative
scenarios and within 100 guesses: (1) TarGuess-I outperforms its
foremost counterpart by 142% against security-savvy users and by
46% against normal users; (2) TarGuess-II outperforms its fore-
most counterpart by 169% on security-savvy users and by 72%
against normal users; and (3) Both TarGuess-III and IV gain suc-
cess rates over 73% against normal users and over 32% against
security-savvy users. TarGuess-III and IV, for the ﬁrst time, address
the issue of cross-site online guessing when given the victim’s one
sister password and some PII.

INTRODUCTION
Passwords ﬁrmly remain the most prevalent mechanism for user
authentication in various computer systems. To understand pass-
word security, a number of probabilistic guessing models, e.g.,
Markov n-grams [21, 25] and probabilistic context-free grammars
(PCFG) [31, 35], have been successively proposed. A common
feature of these guessing models is that they characterize a trawl-
ing ofﬂine guessing attacker who mainly works against the leaked

password ﬁles and aims to crack as many accounts as possible.
As highlighted in [16], ofﬂine guessing attacks, no matter trawling
ones or targeted ones, only pose a real concern in the very limited
circumstance:
the server’s password ﬁle is leaked, the leakage
goes undetected, and the passwords are also properly hashed and
salted. Recent research [7, 16] has realized that it should be the
role of websites to protect user passwords from ofﬂine guessing by
securely storing password ﬁles, while normal users only need to
choose passwords that can survive online guessing.
Online guessing can be launched against the publicly facing
server by anyone using a browser at anytime, with the primary
constraint being the number of guesses allowed. Trawling online
guessing mainly exploits users’ behavior of choosing popular pass-
words [22, 34], and it can be well addressed by various security
mechanisms at the server (e.g., suspicious login detection [14],
rate-limiting and lockout [18]). However, targeted online guessing
(see Fig. 1) can exploit not only weak popular passwords, but also
passwords reused across sites and passwords containing personal
information. This is a serious security concern, since various
Personally Identiﬁable Information (PII) and leaked passwords be-
come readily available due to unending data breaches [2, 3, 17].
For instance, the most recent large-scale PII data breach in April
2016 [3] involves 50 million Turkish citizens, accounting for 64%
of the population. According to the CNNIC 2015 report [1], over
78.2% of the 668 million Chinese netizens have suffered PII data
leakage. In a series of recent breaches, over 253 million American
netizens become victims of PII and password leakage [27].
This indicates that the existing password creation rules (e.g., [15,
28]) and strength meters (e.g., [24,32]) grounded on these trawling
guessing models [21, 25, 31, 35] can mainly accommodate to the
limited ofﬂine guessing threat, taking no account of the targeted
online guessing threat which is increasingly more damaging and
realistic. This misplaced research focus largely attributes to the
failure (see [7, 33]) of the academic world to identify the crux
of current practices and to suggest convincingly better password
solutions than current practices to lead the industrial world.
The main challenge for targeted online password guessing is to
effectively characterize an attacker A’s guessing model, with multi-
ple dimensions of available information (see Fig. 2) well captured,
while the number of guesses allowed to A is small – the NIST
Authentication Guideline [18] requires Level 1 and 2 systems to
keep login failures less than 100 per user account in any 30-day
period. The following explains why it is a challenge.
First, people’s password choices vary much among each other.
When creating a password, some people reuse an existing pass-
word, and some modify an existing password; Some incorporate
PII into their passwords, yet others do not; Some favor digits,
some favor letters, and so on. Thus, a user population’s passwords
created for a given web service can differ greatly. Therefore, the
Figure 1: Targeted online guessing. Figure 2: Multiple info for A.
trawling guessing models [21, 25, 31, 35], which aim to produce
a single guess list for all users, are not suitable for characterizing
targeted online guessing.
Second, users’ PII is highly heterogeneous. Some kinds of
PII (e.g., name, and hobby) are composed of letters, some (e.g.,
birthday and phone number) are composed of digits, and some
(e.g., user name) are a mixture of letters, digits and symbols. Some
PII (e.g., name, birthday and hobby), as shown in Fig. 2, can be
directly used as password components, while others (e.g., gender
and education) cannot. As we will show, most of them have an
impact on people’s password choice. Thus, it is challenging to, at a
large-scale, automatically incorporate such heterogeneous PII into
guessing models when the guess attempts allowed is limited.
Third, users employ a diversiﬁed set of transformation rules to
modify passwords for cross-site reuse. As shown in [12, 32], when
given a password, there are over a dozen transformation rules,
such as insert, delete, capitalization and leet (e.g., password!
passw0rd) and the synthesized ones (e.g., password!
Passw0rd1), that a user can utilize to create a new password.
How to prioritize these rules for each individual user is not easy.
Moreover, which transformation rules users will apply for pass-
word reuse are often context dependent. Suppose attacker A targets
Alice’s eBay account which requires passwords of length 8+, and
knows that Alice is in her 30s. With access to a sister pass-
word Alice1978Yahoo leaked from Alice’s Yahoo account, A
will have a higher chance by guessing Alice1978eBay than by
Alice1978 due to the inertia of human behaviors. Yet, when
Alice’s leaked password is 123456, A would more likely succeed
by guessing Alice1978 than by Alice1978eBay. When site
password policies are also considered, the situation may further
vary. Such context dependence necessitate an adaptive, semantics-
aware cross-site guessing model.
1.1 Related work
Zhang et al. [37] suggested an algorithm for predicting a user’s
future password with previous ones for the same account. Das et
al. [12] studied the password reuse issue, and proposed a cross-site
cracking algorithm. However, their algorithm is not optimal for
targeted online guessing for four reasons. First, it does not consider
common popular passwords (e.g., iloveyou, and pa$$w0rd)
which do not involve reuse behaviors or user PII. Second, it as-
sumes that all users employ the transformation rules in a ﬁxed
priority. Yet, as we observe, this priority is actually dynamic
and context-dependent. Third, their algorithm does not consider
various synthesized rules. Fourth, it is heuristics based.
Li et al. [20] examined how user’s PII may impact password
security, and found that 60.1% of users incorporate at least one
kind of PII into their passwords. They proposed a semantics-rich
algorithm, Personal-PCFG, which considers six types of personal
information: name, birthdate, phone number, National ID, email
address and user name. However, as we will show, its length-
based PII matching and substitution approach makes it inaccurate
to capture user PII usages, greatly hindering the cracking efﬁciency.
Our TarGuess-I manages to overcome this issue by using a type-
based PII matching approach and gains drastic improvements.
1.2 Our contributions
In this work, we make the following key contributions:
(cid:15) A practical framework.
To overcome the challenges
discussed above, we propose TarGuess, a framework to
characterize typical targeted online guessing attacks, with
sound probabilistic models (rather than ad hoc models or
heuristics). TarGuess captures seven typical scenarios, with
combination of various
each based on a different
information available to the attacker.
(cid:15) Four probabilistic algorithms. To model the most repre-
sentative targeted guessing scenarios, we propose four al-
gorithms by leveraging probabilistic techniques including
PCFG, Markov and Bayesian theory. Our algorithms all
signiﬁcantly outperform prior art. We further show how
they can be readily employed to deal with the other three
remaining attacking scenarios.
(cid:15) An extensive evaluation. We perform a series of experi-
ments to demonstrate that both the efﬁcacy and general ap-
plicability of our algorithms. Our empirical results show that
an overwhelming fraction of users’ passwords are vulnerable
to our targeted online guessing. This suggests that the danger
of this threat has been signiﬁcantly underestimated.
(cid:15) New insights. For example, Type-based PII-tags are more
effective than length-based PII-tags in targeted guessing.
Simply incorporating many kinds of PII into algorithms will
not increase success rates, which is counter intuitive. The
success rate of a guess decreases with a Zipf’s law as the
rank of this guess in the guess list increases.
2. PRELIMINARIES
We now explicate what kinds of user personal information are
considered in this work and elaborate on the security model.
2.1 Explication of personal information
The most prominent feature that differentiates a targeted guess-
ing attack from a trawling one is that, the former involves user-
speciﬁc data, or so-called “personal info”. This term is sometimes
used inter-changeably with the term “personally identiﬁable info”
[10, 20], while sometimes their deﬁnitions vary greatly in different
situations, laws, regulations [23, 29]. Generally, a user’s personal
info is “any info relating to” this user [29], and it is broader than
PII. For better comprehension, in Table 1 we provide the ﬁrst
classiﬁcation of personal info in the case of password cracking,
making a systematical investigation of targeted guessing possible.
We divide user personal information into three kinds, with each
kind having a varied degree of secrecy, different roles in passwords
and various types of speciﬁc elements. The ﬁrst kind is user PII
(e.g., name and gender), which is natively semipublic: public to
friends, colleagues, acquaintances, etc., yet private to strangers.
The second kind is user identiﬁcation credentials, and parts of them
(e.g., user name) are public, while parts of them (e.g., password)
are exclusively private. The remaining user personal data falls into
the third kind and is irrelevant to this work. We further divide user
PII into two types: Type-1 and Type-2. Type-1 PII (e.g., name and
birthday) can be the building blocks of passwords, while Type-2
PII (e.g., gender and education [22]) may impact user behavior of
password creation yet cannot be directly used in passwords. Each
type of PII shapes our guessing algorithms quite distinctly.
Here we highlight a special kind of user personal information —
a user’s passwords at various web services. As shown in [12, 32],
users tend to reuse or modify their existing passwords at other sites
(called sister passwords) for new accounts. However, such sister
passwords are becoming more and more easily available due to the
unending catastrophic password ﬁle leakages (see [2, 4, 27]).
