User: Task 11: Introduce how to use network commands in Linux
Assistant: In Linux, you can use many different network commands to manage and analyze network connections and configurations. The following are some commonly used network commands and their usage: 1. ping command: The ping command is used to test the network connection. It can send a signal to a specific IP address or domain name and wait for a response. For example: $ ping www.google.com PING www.google.com (172.217.13.68) 56(84) bytes of data. 64 bytes from lga34s14-in-f4.1e100.net (172.217.13.68): icmp_seq=1 ttl =55 time=3.10 ms 64 bytes from lga34s14-in-f4.1e100.net (172.217.13.68): icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=3.03 ms 64 bytes from lga34s14-in-f4.1e100.net (172.217.13.68 ): icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=3.05 ms ^C --- www.google.com ping statistics --- 3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2004ms rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 3.025/3.062/3.104/0.052 ms 2. ifconfig command: ifconfig command is used to configure and display the network interface in the system, you can view and modify the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, etc. For example: $ ifconfig eth0 eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0c:29:ff:ff:ff inet addr:192.168.1.1 Bcast:192.168.255.255 Mask:255.255.0.0 UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST MTU:1500 Metric:1 RX packets :727987 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0 TX packets:631860 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0 collisions:0 txqueuelen:1000 RX bytes:107087019 (107.0 MB) TX bytes:1780109 60 (178.0 MB) 3. netstat command: The netstat command is used to display the network connection, routing table, interface status, etc. in the system. For example: $ netstat -a Active Internet connections (servers and established) Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State tcp 0 0 192.168.1.1:ssh 192.168.1.2:62645 ESTABLISHED tcp 0 0 192.168.1.1:http 19 2.168. 1.3:50160 TIME_WAIT tcp 0 0 192.168.1.1:http 192.168.1.3:50163 TIME_WAIT tcp6 0 0 :::80 :::* LISTEN 4. route command: route command is used to configure and display the routing table in the system, you can add , delete, and modify routing rules. For example: $ route Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface 192.168.1.0 * 255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 eth0 169.254.0.0 * 255.255.0.0 U 1000 0 0 eth0 default 192 .168.1.254 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth0 5. host command: The host command is used to query the IP address corresponding to the domain name or reversely query the domain name corresponding to the IP address. For example: $ host www.google.com www.google.com has address 172.217.13.68 6. nslookup command: nslookup command is used to query Domain Name System (DNS) records, you can check DNS server, domain name alias, reverse query, etc. For example: $ nslookup www.google.com Server: 192.168.1.254 Address: 192.168.1.254#53 Non-authoritative answer: Name: www.google.com Address: 172.217.13.68 Each of these commands is very powerful and useful. You will use at least some of them for any Linux task that involves network administration and configuration, so using network commands in Linux is very important.
