User: Instead of encapsulating my entire code in a try{} except{} block, is there someway of catching exceptions globally?
Basically I am looking for a way to have a global exception handler which will handle all unhandled exceptions in the my python application written for google app engine
Assistant: You application probably has a main() function, put the try/except in that function, and it'll catch everything from your application.
