## Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

Scrolling with a precision touchpad is highly convenient, but only if the application responds to scroll events instantly. This smooth and responsive scrolling behavior can be observed in applications such as Microsoft Edge, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains IDEs (when the "Smooth Scrolling" option is enabled).

To enhance the user experience, I propose adding an option to Windows Terminal that allows for pixel-by-pixel scrolling, rather than the current line-by-line scrolling. This would provide a more fluid and precise scrolling experience, aligning with the high standards set by other modern applications.
