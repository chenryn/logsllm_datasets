### NOTE: This feature is addition to #1066
# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
Scrolling with (precision) touchpad is very convenient but only if application
responds to scroll event instantly. This can be observed in Microsoft Edge,
vscode, JetBrains IDEs (Smooth Scrolling option).
I think that Windows Terminal should have option to enable scrolling not line
by line but pixel by pixel.
