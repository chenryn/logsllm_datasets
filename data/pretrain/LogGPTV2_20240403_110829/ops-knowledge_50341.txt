Question: In an audit of a company's data sanitization process for decommissioned servers, it was found that merely overwriting memory cells was insufficient to prevent data recovery. What physical properties of hardware could contribute to this inadequacy and what mitigation strategy could address this issue?
"A": "The adhesive quality of stickers on the servers may retain data imprints; applying RFID tags to track decommissioned hardware for complete destruction could mitigate this.",
"B": "Screen burn-in may display the last shown information; implementing screen dimming technology could mitigate this effect.",
"C": "Magnetic media remanence can retain data; degaussing the drives before disposal could prevent data recovery.",
"D": "The residual charge of ROMs/RAMs could allow data recovery; physically destroying the memory chips could prevent this."
Answer: CD
