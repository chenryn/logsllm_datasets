Abstract—IP address blacklists are a useful source of infor-
mation about repeat attackers. Such information can be used
to prioritize which trafﬁc to divert for deeper inspection (e.g.,
repeat offender trafﬁc), or which trafﬁc to serve ﬁrst (e.g., trafﬁc
from sources that are not blacklisted). But blacklists also suffer
from overspecialization – each list is geared towards a speciﬁc
purpose – and they may be inaccurate due to misclassiﬁcation
or stale information. We propose BLAG, a system that evaluates
and aggregates multiple blacklists feeds, producing a more useful,
accurate and timely master blacklist, tailored to the speciﬁc
customer network. BLAG uses a sample of the legitimate sources
of the customer network’s inbound trafﬁc to evaluate the accuracy
of each blacklist over regions of address space. It then leverages
recommendation systems to select the most accurate information
to aggregate into its master blacklist. Finally, BLAG identiﬁes
portions of the master blacklist that can be expanded into larger
address regions (e.g.
/24 preﬁxes) to uncover more malicious
addresses with minimum collateral damage. Our evaluation of 157
blacklists of various attack types and three ground-truth datasets
shows that BLAG achieves high speciﬁcity up to 99%, improves
recall by up to 114 times compared to competing approaches, and
detects attacks up to 13.7 days faster, which makes it a promising
approach for blacklist generation.
I.
INTRODUCTION
IP blacklists (“blacklists” for short), which contain iden-
tities of prior known offenders, are usually used to aid more
sophisticated defenses, such as spam ﬁlters or security infor-
mation and event management (SIEM) systems, in identifying
trafﬁc that warrants further analysis [15]. Blacklists do not have
to be very accurate to be used in this advisory mode, since they
merely aid another, more sophisticated system, which decides
trafﬁc’s destiny. In fact, prior works [66], [60], [63], [70], [74]
show that blacklists are often not very accurate or useful. They
do not misclassify many legitimate sources, but they miss the
majority of malicious sources.
What if a network suffers a novel attack, which bypasses its
sophisticated defenses? Or what if the attack has such a large
volume that the more sophisticated system cannot keep up?
In these situations, networks usually resort to crude defenses,
such as rate-limiting trafﬁc or ﬁltering all incoming trafﬁc to
a given port number or a destination [65], [67], [1], [54].
IP blacklists could be used as emergency response,
in
case of a novel or large-scale attacks, to ﬁlter attacks from

prior known malicious sources, and act as the ﬁrst layer of
defense. For example, an email server hit by a heavy phishing
campaign, whose signature does not yet exist in the server’s
spam ﬁlters, could use blacklists to drop emails sent by prior
known malicious sources. Or a network under a distributed
denial-of-service attack could use blacklists to drop all trafﬁc
sent by prior known malicious sources, to lessen its load.
Blacklists are easy to implement since only the source IP
address of incoming trafﬁc is checked, which can be cheap
at line speed. In this emergency mode, blacklists would have
to be very accurate, since they would actively drop trafﬁc. This
means that blacklists should be able to identify the majority
of attack sources while keeping misclassiﬁcation of legitimate
sources low. This paper explores how to generate sufﬁciently
accurate blacklists for emergency use.
Individual blacklists today suffer from several drawbacks
that limit their accuracy in malicious source identiﬁcation.
Firstly, individual blacklists miss many malicious sources. This
effect may come from their limited vantage points – e.g.,
blacklist maintainers may have honeypots in the United States
but not in India – or from their limited scope – e.g., blacklists
are created for speciﬁc attack classes, like spam. On the other
hand, compromised devices are constantly being drafted into
botnets and misused for different attacks, such as sending spam
one day and participating in denial-of-service attacks on a
different day. Aggregating blacklists from different maintainers
and across various attack types can improve the accuracy of
malicious source identiﬁcation over any individual blacklist.
Secondly, blacklists are snapshots of malicious sources at
a given time. Attackers are known to evade blacklisting by
staying dormant, only to resume malicious activities later [66].
Historical blacklist data can provide additional intelligence on
active past offenders that are likely to re-offend in the future.
Finally, malicious sources have historically been known to
concentrate in a few mismanaged networks [81]. Thus, ex-
panding certain blacklisted IP addresses into IP preﬁxes could
improve the accuracy of malicious source identiﬁcation. But
the aggregation of data from multiple lists and past periods,
and expansion of addresses into preﬁxes may greatly increase
misclassiﬁcations of legitimate trafﬁc if applied naïvely. We
propose BLAG (BLacklist AGgregator), which performs smart
aggregation of blacklist data, and tailors this data to the
customer network1. BLAG’s blacklists have a much higher
accuracy of malicious source identiﬁcation and they keep
collateral damage to legitimate sources low. BLAG overcomes
problems of existing blacklists as follows:

emergency response.
(a) Blacklist coverage in routable /24 pre-
ﬁxes that are blacklisted.
(b) Blacklist overlap across different black-
list categories.
(c) IP addresses blacklisted in the same /24
preﬁx.
Figure 1: Blacklists have low coverage and tend to overlap with other categories of blacklists. Therefore, aggregating blacklists
of different types can improve coverage. Also blacklisted addresses tend to be collocated, thus expanding IP addresses to preﬁxes
may further improve malicious source identiﬁcation.
1) Aggregation: BLAG aggregates IP addresses from 157
blacklists of different attack types to improve coverage.
BLAG also includes historical listings from these bla-
cklists and assigns relevance score that determines which
historical IP addresses are more likely to re-offend.
2) Estimate misclassiﬁcations: BLAG uses a recommen-
dation system, together with a sample of sources that
send inbound trafﬁc to a customer network to tailor its
blacklist to this customer. BLAG identiﬁes portions of
individual blacklists that may lead to the legitimate source
misclassiﬁcations and prunes them out. Other portions are
aggregated into the master blacklist for this customer.
3) Selective expansion: BLAG selects a subset of
IP
addresses on the master blacklist
to expand into /24
preﬁxes. Only those IP addresses are expanded, where
the expansion is not likely to increase legitimate source
misclassiﬁcations for the given customer.
We present
three real-world deployment scenarios for
BLAG2 covering different attacks, where customer networks
can reduce the burden on resource-intensive technologies.
BLAG improves existing blacklisting approaches by increas-
ing recall (malicious source identiﬁcation) from 0.1–18.4%
to 6.4–69.7%, while maintaining high speciﬁcity (legitimate
source identiﬁcation) of 95–99.5%. BLAG also outperforms
PRESTA [78], a proposed blacklist aggregation approach by
achieving 11.5–84.4% higher speciﬁcity, with comparable re-
call. BLAG also improves the detection delay, discovering
malicious sources 8.8–13.4 days faster than competing ap-
proaches.
II. PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT BLACKLISTS
In this section, we illustrate the drawbacks that blacklists
have, that limit their usefulness in emergency scenarios. We
then discuss possible solutions to improve blacklisting and
some challenges that we must address. We ﬁrst show that bla-
cklists generally have low coverage and blacklists of different
attack types tend to overlap with one another (Section II-A).
This motivates the need for aggregating multiple blacklists

of different attack types to improve coverage of malicious
sources. We further show IP addresses that were blacklisted in
the past get blacklisted again, and sometimes soon after they
were removed from a blacklist (Section II-B). This motivates
the need for inclusion of historical blacklist data to further
improve coverage of malicious sources. Finally, we show that
blacklisted IP addresses are often collocated within the same
/24 preﬁx, thus, expanding some IP addresses to preﬁxes can
improve attack detection (Section II-C).
In all cases, some addresses that appear on blacklists may
be “wrongly accused”, i.e., they may be misclassiﬁed, legit-
imate sources or they may be previously malicious sources,
which were since cleaned. We illustrate this in Section II-D
to motivate the need for smart, selective aggregation and
expansion only of those portions of blacklists that are unlikely
to contain legitimate sources.
In this section, we leverage our Blacklist dataset, whose
details are given in Section IV-A. It consists of 157 publicly
available, popular blacklists. We collected their data regularly
for 11 months in 2016. We have roughly categorized each
blacklist into four categories, based on the type of malicious
activities they capture. Spam blacklists monitor email spam or
emails that contain malicious content and Malware blacklists
monitor IP addresses that host or distribute malware. Attack
blacklists, on the other hand, contain IP addresses that initiate
DDoS attacks, bruteforce or attacks on speciﬁc protocols such
as VoIP or SSH. Finally, Reputation blacklists list IP addresses
that have a low reputation, e.g., because they send unwanted
trafﬁc. The algorithm to calculate this reputation is known only
to blacklist maintainers.
A. Fragmented Information
Monitoring the entire Internet accurately is impossible. By
necessity, each blacklist will gather data from some limited
area of the Internet, and thus information about malicious
sources will be fragmented over many blacklists. Figure 1(a)
illustrates the coverage of individual blacklists in our Blacklist
dataset and the unique contribution of blacklists over the
dataset “Black24,” containing all routable /24 preﬁxes (ex-
tracted from Routeviews [71]) that have at least one blacklisted

address. On average, a blacklist reports only 3.03% of Black24.
Nixspam blacklist [68] has the highest coverage of 60.7%
of Black24. Some blacklists also have unique contributions,
i.e., they list addresses from preﬁxes that appear on no other
blacklist. On average, a blacklist contributes unique addresses
that belong to 0.16% of Black24. Nixspam blacklist has the
highest unique contribution – 10.9% of Black24. Previous
studies observed similarly low coverage [74], [60] of blacklists.
Another possible reason for fragmented information is the
blacklists’ focus on a speciﬁc type of attacks. This is again
by necessity as blacklists built from spam ﬁlter alerts will
only see spam sources, while intrusion detection systems will
only see sources of scans and network attacks. Figure 1(b)
shows the overlap of blacklist categories on the y-axis with
the blacklist categories on the x-axis. On average, blacklist
categories have an overlap of 20.4% with other blacklist
categories. The highest overlap is seen in the “attack” category
(average 38.7% overlap) and the lowest overlap is seen with
the “spam” category (average 2.5% overlap). Although our
categorization may not be perfect, we observe that IP addresses
are reported across different types of blacklists. Therefore,
aggregating multiple blacklists across different attack types
can increase blacklist coverage and detect sources of multiple
attack types.
B. Re-offense Is Frequent
Figure 2(a) shows the percentage of blacklisted IP ad-
dresses (in any blacklist) that have been removed and then
appeared again on the same blacklist. On average, 29.3%
of blacklisted IP addresses re-offend. Particularly,
in two
blacklists, Bambenek Pushdo and Palevo, all IP addresses
blacklisted re-offend. However, these are very small blacklists
that have reported only 1 and 12 IP addresses during our
monitoring period. Figure 2(b) shows the duration between
each offense, that is, the number of days the IP addresses
stay dormant before they are blacklisted again. On average,
reoffenses occur within 9 days and about 91% of reoffense
occurs within 30 days. This motivates the need for aggregation
of historical blacklist information, especially over the recent
past, to improve coverage of malicious sources.
C. Malicious Sources Are Co-located
Prior research has shown that attackers tend to concentrate
in a few mismanaged networks [81]. Thus blacklisting an
