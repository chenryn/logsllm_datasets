  * OS Version: Win10
I know window.visibleEditors is supposed to contain actual text editors but it
is not possible to tell at the moment if a VirtualDocument (ie a
htmlContentProvider) is in view.
The scenario I would need this for is for detecting if a Virtual Document has
focus when a command is triggered. If there is another work around for this
please let me know.
Thanks ðŸ˜„
