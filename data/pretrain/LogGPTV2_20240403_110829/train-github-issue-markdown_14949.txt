### Expected Behavior and Usage Scenario of the Proposed Feature

**Expected Behavior:**
The proposed feature would enable users to navigate directly from state A to state B using a single keyboard shortcut. This streamlined process aims to enhance user productivity by reducing the number of steps required to achieve the desired outcome.

**Usage Scenario:**
This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where frequent and rapid transitions between two specific states are necessary. For example, in a classroom or work environment, this feature can help users quickly switch between different applications or windows, maintaining their focus and productivity.
