in situations where excess capacity is available.
For deﬂniteness we consider the following explicit
speciﬂcations of communication and computation pa-
rameters in the analysis. Suppose all packets have a
ﬂxed length and consider a continuous transmission set-
ting where a sender has an available bandwidth of W
packets per second which he fully utilizes. We con-
sider a shared channel model where the attacker has
the capability of transmitting at the rate of RW pack-
ets per second where R is the dimensionless attack fac-
tor. We assume that sender packets arrive in order at
the receiver (though adversarial packets may be timed
and inserted anywhere in the sequence) and that the
receiver has a computational budget of K = Ks sig-
nature checks per second on average. Finally, we sup-
pose that packet transmissions are over an independent
loss channel in which each packet transmitted by the
sender is lost independently with probability p. We do
not assume that the adversary’s packets are also sub-
ject to loss. Typical numbers that we consider in the
examples and simulations are 1500 byte packets; trans-
missions over 1 Mbps, 10 Mbps, and 100 Mbps connec-
tions, which translate into packet transmission rates
of W = 83, 833, and 8333 packets per second, respec-
tively; proportionate and disproportionate attacks with
attack factors R = 1 and R = 10, respectively; compu-
tational budgets K between 40 to 800 public key checks
per second on stock PC’s assuming that we can devote
5% to 10% of the processor toward signature checks;
packet loss probabilities p of 5%, 20%, and 40%; conﬂ-
dence parameter – = 0:01; and overhead o between 5%
and 10%.

rates,
In this setting our goal is to determine the size and
composition of a transmission group that meets the
conﬂdence and overhead constraints. Let N (to be de-
termined) denote the number of packets in a transmis-
sion group and let Nd, Nh, and Ns denote the num-
ber of data packets, hash and parity packets, and sig-
nature packets, respectively, comprising the transmis-
sion group. Once determined, the size the transmission
group speciﬂes the sender-side authentication latency,
¿ = N=W . (Of course, this is for the independent loss
model; in a correlated loss model, the authentication
packets will need to be interspersed across the follow-
ing transmission group to combat burst errors leading
to a latency of approximately 2N=W .)
Signature Stream
The number of signature copies Ns needed per trans-
mission group will be determined loosely by the loss
rate and the attack factor. The actual estimates de-
pend on whether the sequential veriﬂcation or bin ver-
iﬂcation protocols are adopted and we consider these
in turn.
Selective sequential veriﬂcation Suppose that
each incoming signature is veriﬂed independently with
probability …. The following result is elementary but
useful.

Lemma 1 The receiver will successfully verify a sig-
nature in any given transmission group with conﬂdence
at least 1 ¡ – provided Ns ‚ log(–)=log
1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)…
.
A fortiori it su–ces if Ns ‚ ¡ log(–)=(1 ¡ p)….
Proof: Consider the start of the transmission of the
current group of signature packets (i.e., Ns copies of
the same signature packet). The probability that a
given signature packet is both successfully received and
veriﬂed by the receiver is given by (1 ¡ p)…. It follows
¡
that the probability that none of the bona ﬂde signature
packets in the current group is successfully veriﬂed is
1 ¡ (1 ¡ p)…
Ns and we require this to be no larger
than –. The bound on Ns follows. Finish oﬁ the proof
with the elementary observation ¡ log(1 ¡ x) > x for
⁄
0 < x < 1.
¢
As the entire transmission group requires N=W sec-
onds for transmission, under an informed DoS attack
on the signature stream with attack factor R, the max-
imum number of packets in the signature stream of the
current group is Ns+RN = R(Nd+Nh)+(R+1)Ns. To
keep within the computational budget of K signature
checks per second on average at the receiver, it su–ces
hence to verify signatures randomly with probability
… = KN=W
Ns + RN

K(Nd + Nh + Ns)
W R(Nd + Nh) + W (R + 1)Ns
: (2)
(More accurately, … is chosen as the smaller of the
above quantity and 1; to obviate trivialities suppose
that the right-hand side above is less than 1.) A di-
rect application of the lemma shows that a choice of
Ns ‚ ¡ log(–)=(1 ¡ p)… will provide adequate protec-
tion against a signature (cid:176)ood DoS attack while staying
within the given computational resources.
It follows
that the number of signatures Ns may be chosen to be

It is easy to verify that Q is convex
and has two real roots. Indeed, the discriminant of the
quadratic is nonnegative and given by

As we may choose Ns to be any integral value greater

and by virtue of the above bound on the discriminant
we hence obtain the following
Theorem 2 Under a signature (cid:176)ood attack with attack
factor R in a shared channel with independent packet
loss probability p, selective sequential veriﬂcation at a
rate of K signature checks per second on average will
result in the acquisition of a valid signature for any
transmission group with probability at least 1 ¡ – if

Observe that, as anticipated, the number of signature
copies in a transmission group is determined by the
attack factor R and the loss rate p and that, moreover,
Ns may be speciﬂed independently of Nd and Nh.
Selective bin veriﬂcation The probability that
none of B selected bins contains a valid signature is pB.
Thus, we can ensure that the probability of encounter-
ing a valid signature in the group of bins correspond-
ing to a transmission group is at least 1 ¡ – provided
B ‚ log –=log p. Consider a signature (cid:176)ood attack with
attack factor R over a shared channel. Condition on the
number of consecutive transmission groups for which
veriﬂcation failed following the last successfully vali-
dated transmission group. The window of signature
packets given j ‚ 0 consecutive group veriﬂcation fail-
ures is then bounded above by (j +2)RN + Ns packets.
Selective bin veriﬂcation proceeds by examining the B
smallest bins in order of size. The total number of
signature packets in these B bins is then bounded by
=Ns. As the probability of j consec-

It su–ces if the right-hand side is bounded above by

The mean rate of signature checks will be bounded by

Observe that the signature overhead imposed by the
two strategies is very comparable.
Hash/Parity Stream
The number of hash packets k in a transmission group
is proportional to the number of data packets in the
group, k = ﬁNd for some constant ﬁ. If, for instance,
packets have size 1500 bytes and for hashes we use
the ﬂrst 10 bytes (of 20) in a SHA hash, then each
hash packet of 1500 bytes contains the hashes of 144
data packets (some packet real estate to the tune of
56 bytes being consumed by various headers) and thus,
k = Nd=144. The number of parity packets ‘ requisite,
however, in the absence of a DoS attack depends on
the channel loss probability as seen in the estimate (1)
though, as seen, ‘ only grows linearly with k, hence
with Nd. In the absence of a hash/parity (cid:176)ood attack,
the total number of packets Nh = k + ‘ required in the
hash/parity stream increases linearly with the number
of data packets Nd. The typical overhead is less than
a couple of percent as we see in Table 3.
Hash/parity (cid:176)ood attacks may be handled on one of
two levels. Hash computations are typically an order
of magnitude faster than signature veriﬂcations; a re-
ceiver can compute of the order of 77; 000 packet hashes
per second but only about 8000 signature checks per
second on a stock PC. If the attack factor R and avail-
able bandwidth W are both moderate (for instance, a
proportional attack on a 10 Mbps link), the receiver
can simply compute the hash of all packets in the
hash/parity stream discarding spurious packets (as-
suming that a valid signature has been acquired).
If
the attack factor R exceeds the capacity of the receiver
Kh to perform all the hashes, a variation on the bin
strategy allows us to force the adversary to diﬁuse his
advantage at small cost in overhead. The idea is to se-
lect a number of parity packets large enough that the
the lowest population B bins contain at least k valid
packets from the hash/parity stream. As packet losses
are independent, Hoeﬁding’s bound quickly allows us
to estimate the requisite number of bins,

to ensure that at least k of the B selected bins contain
valid hash/parity packets.
The analysis now parallels that for the number of
signatures in selective bin veriﬂcation and we obtain
the following
Theorem 4 Selective bin veriﬂcation yields at least k
packets in the hash/parity stream with conﬂdence at
least 1 ¡ – if the number of packets in the hash/parity
stream satisﬂes

The number of parity packets ‘ that are requisite can
now be determined as the larger of the values deter-
mined from (1) and (3).
Data Stream
The number of packets in the data stream of a trans-
mission group can now be determined. Recall that a
design parameter is the maximum allowable transmis-
sion group authentication overhead o ‚ (Nh+Ns)=N =
1¡Nd=N which is typically speciﬂed by the application.
The number of packets Nd in the data stream hence is
required to satisfy Nd ‚ (1¡ o)N = (1¡ o)(Nd + Nh +
In line with the discussion for the hash/parity
Ns).
stream, we may set Nh = cNd for a constant c so that
we obtain the following
Theorem 5 A choice of
Nd ‚
(1 ¡ o)Ns
1 ¡ (1 ¡ o)(1 + c)
data packets in a transmission group together with
Nh = cNd hash/parity packets guarantees that the over-
head is no larger than the speciﬂed o.
We can recast the bound in terms of data rates. Sup-
pose an application has to support a minimum data
rate of D packets per second. Under continuous trans-
mission, this is equivalent to requiring that the maxi-
mum allowable overhead satisﬂes o ‚ 1¡ D=W so that
we may cast the expression for Nd in terms of the data
rate D that the application has to support.
Observe that N = Nd=(1 ¡ o) so that, in particu-
lar, the sender-side authentication latency ¿ to achieve
conﬂdence of at least 1 ¡ – of verifying received pack-
ets in a transmission group is approximately N=W …
Nd=W (1 ¡ o). Consider a low bandwidth, low compu-
tational capability example where the sender has ac-
cess to a 1 Mbps channel, whence W = 83 packets per
second assuming 1500 byte packets, and the receiver
can only compute Ks = 40 public key checks per sec-
ond. The hash/parity overhead is trivial as is easy to
see: only a single hash packet is required. Consider a
proportionate DoS signature attack with R = 1. Sup-
pose the channel has an error rate of p = 1=2. With a
choice of conﬂdence parameter – = 0:01, and a maxi-
mum speciﬂed overhead of 20% the latency is approxi-
mately 2 seconds. If the maximum speciﬂed overhead is
5%, the latency is approximately 9 seconds. We provide
some more examples focusing on higher bandwidths in
the following sections. At 10-100Mbps we get latencies
of 1-2 seconds and overheads of 1-3%.
Data (cid:176)ood attacks are easy to handle if the attack
factor is moderate: we simply compute all hashes dis-
carding packets that are spurious.
If the attack fac-
tor exceeds the computational capability of the receiver
to compute hashes, a data (cid:176)ood attack eﬁectively in-
creases the packet drop rate: as many arriving data
packets are veriﬂed as there is computational capacity
to handle the hashes. A variant of the bin approach
may be used here as well to weed out large attacks on
individual packets.
B.3 Acquisition Phase
We now derive a bound on the parameter g, the number
of transmission groups, over which we buﬁer signature
packets to protect against a replay attack. It is easy
to see that the probability that we fail to acquire a
valid current signature within g groups is (cid:176)g where (cid:176) =
(1¡(1¡ p)…)Ns. Thus choosing g = log –= log (cid:176) su–ces
to ensure that we will obtain a valid current signature
packet with conﬂdence at least 1 ¡ –.
