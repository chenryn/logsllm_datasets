### Title: The Evil Alt-Ego: (Ab)using HTTP Alternative Services

The HTTP Alternative Services header (Alt-Svc, RFC 7838), introduced in 2013 by experienced developers with the intention of improving load balancing, protocol optimization, and client segmentation, has been widely implemented in both mobile and desktop browsers. However, this seemingly benign feature has an insidious side that can be exploited by malicious actors.

In this presentation, we will delve into the history of the Alt-Svc HTTP header, its original purpose, and the significant risks it inadvertently poses to end users. We will examine how Alternative Services can be misused to scan ports blacklisted by browsers, probe firewalled hosts, and launch Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Additionally, we will highlight how these services can be abused to bypass popular security measures such as Safe Browsing, and online site checkers like VirusTotal, URLVoid, Sucuri, and IPVoid.

In the realm of privacy, the Alt-Svc header can be hijacked to track users at both the network layer by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and at the application layer by first or third-party websites. This allows for the circumvention of third-party tracking protections on browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Brave. Furthermore, the header can be used covertly by various access points, such as a coffee shop, to exfiltrate parts of a victim's browser history.

Our attacks differ from standard JavaScript-based attacks in that they operate at a lower level of abstraction, making them invisible to the user through the browser's interface or JavaScript-based detection techniques. These attacks require no user interaction and can be executed from third-party web content, affecting browsers such as Firefox, Tor, Chrome, and Brave to varying degrees. It is crucial that these vulnerabilities be addressed in the browser source code, and we have disclosed them accordingly.

We will conclude with a discussion of vendor responses and practical mitigations, some of which are currently being implemented by browser developers. To date, one of our reported vulnerabilities has been patched by Mozilla (CVE-2019-11728), and another has been fixed under Brave's bug bounty program.

In summary, this talk will underscore how a single, well-intentioned protocol update can give rise to a multitude of unintended and exploitable "alt-egos."
