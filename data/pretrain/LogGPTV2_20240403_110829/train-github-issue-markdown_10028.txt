 **Pablo** opened **SPR-7710** and commented
In freemarker, if I use the formInput macro with an array parameter:
spring generates a form with an invalid id: 'values[0]'
This is related to https://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-2380, which was
the same bug but with jsp. It is possible that the same happens with velocity.
To fix it in freemarker, you can change, in spring.ftl:
160c160  
${stringStatusValue}" ${attributes}  
â€”
>  _")?replace("]", "_ ")}' name="${status.expression}" value=" fieldType!="password">${stringStatusValue}"
> ${attributes}
This change replaces the [ and ] with _.
I am currently using spring 2.5, so it would be nice to have it backported, if
possible.
thanks a lot.
