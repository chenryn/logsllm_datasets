**Title: Botconf 2016 - Cracking Banking Fraud**

This workshop delves into the world of banking malware, with a specific focus on the relentless pursuit by researchers to uncover and decipher the configurations that guide these attacks. These configurations, often referred to as "attack playbooks," dictate which banks are targeted and the methods used to carry out the fraud. The constantly evolving nature of these data fragments, coupled with the frequent changes in encryption methods, keeps security professionals on high alert.

During this workshop, participants will gain an in-depth understanding of the modus operandi of banking malware. They will step into the role of a researcher, engaging in a hands-on, guided process to analyze encrypted configurations and study the techniques used to protect the data. The workshop will cover the methods of encryption employed by the malware and guide participants through the formulation of a simple decryption method. 

Our case study will center on the notorious Dridex malware, a sophisticated and widely-used banking Trojan. Participants will be introduced to the landscape of banking fraud, learn about the research process for decrypting and understanding malicious encryption, and acquire fundamental tools and skills for handling encrypted data of unknown formats. Additionally, they will experience the excitement of a live challenge, putting their newly acquired knowledge to the test.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in combating banking fraud and the practical skills needed to address real-world threats.
