**Question: How to undo a DROP Table? I accidentally dropped all tables. Can I restore them? I don't have a backup copy.**

**Answer:**

If you do not have any form of backup, unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to recover the dropped tables. 

However, if you have any kind of backup, even if it is outdated, and if binary logging was enabled (via the `log-bin` option in your MySQL configuration file, typically `my.cnf` or `my.ini`), there may be a chance to recover the data from the point of the last backup. You would need to use the binary logs to replay the transactions up to the point just before the `DROP TABLE` command was executed.

I'm sorry to hear about this situation; it's certainly a difficult way to start the week. If you have any further details or need assistance with the recovery process, please let me know.
