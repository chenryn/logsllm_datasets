User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to undo DROP Table? I accidentally dropped all tables. Can I restore back? I don't have the backup copy.

Assistant: If you have literally no backup then I'm 99% sure you're out of luck.

If you do have any form of backup, however old, then do you have binary logging turned on via the log-bin option into the MySQL config file (my.ini)? If so they you might be able to recover since last backup.

Bad way to start a week dude, sorry.
