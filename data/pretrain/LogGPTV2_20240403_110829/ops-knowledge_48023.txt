User: How to build a Python package from source code?
Assistant: The basic steps to build a Python package are as follows: 1. Write the source code, usually placed in a separate folder; 2. Create the necessary files, such as README.md, LICENSE. Among them, README.md is optional, but it is recommended to use it to explain the purpose of the project and API usage and other information; 3. Create a setup.py file, which is the main configuration file for Python packaging and deployment. After installing the setuptools and wheel modules, you can use the command python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel to package the code; 4. Execute the packaging command to generate the source package and the binary package, where the source package (.tar.gz) contains the complete source code, and the binary package (.whl) is binary code compiled for different platforms and Python versions; 5. Use the twine tool to upload the package to PyPI (other Pypi servers can also be used). After twine is installed, you can use the twine upload dist/* command to upload the package; 6. Install the package: use the pip install command pip install package_name to install the Python package. Note: 1. In order to avoid duplication of package names, first check whether the package name already exists on PyPI; 2. In the setup.py file, you need to set the project name, version number, author, dependent library, entry script and other information.
