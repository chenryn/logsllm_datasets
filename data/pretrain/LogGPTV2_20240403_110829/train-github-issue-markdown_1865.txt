In the provided image, you can observe that when the animation is running, a scroll bar appears. This issue has been noted on OS X 10.6.8 with the latest version of Chrome. Additionally, there is a slight 1-pixel white border visible between the navigation bar and the collapsed navigation items. This border did not appear in the previous release (RC1).
