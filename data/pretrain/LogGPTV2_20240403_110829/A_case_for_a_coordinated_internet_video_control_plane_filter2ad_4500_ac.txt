### Network Capacity and Distribution Costs

A given network is characterized by its capacity, i.e., the number of clients it can serve, and its distribution costs. Our objective is to assign each user a suitable Content Delivery Network (CDN) and bitrate that maximizes a notion of global utility for both content providers and consumers. This assignment must operate within the provider’s cost constraints and the CDNs' capacities. 

### Challenges in CDN and Bitrate Assignment

There are three main challenges in this process:

1. **Utility and Policy Objective Definition**:
   - We need to define a suitable utility function that reflects the quality of service, such as bitrate, buffering, and other quality metrics.
   - The utility function should also align with the provider’s policy goals, such as prioritizing premium customers over non-paying users.
   - Designing a comprehensive video utility metric that combines various quality aspects (e.g., bitrate, rebuffering, startup delay) is an open challenge [21, 35, 40].
   - Providers may also specify additional policy constraints, such as whether to admit new clients when all CDNs are overloaded.

2. **Optimization Speed**:
   - The optimization must be fast enough to periodically re-optimize assignments in response to dynamic network conditions.

3. **Stability and Bias Avoidance**:
   - The optimization process must be stable and should not introduce biases or instability (see Section 5.1).

### Potential for Improvement

Before designing a specific control plane, we aim to establish the potential improvement in video quality that can be achieved by choosing a better CDN. This section analyzes the potential performance enhancement that clients could achieve by selecting a more suitable CDN. These techniques can be extended to realize the performance oracle described in the previous section.

#### Approach

Our goal is to determine the potential performance improvement if each session makes the best possible choice. Ideally, each client would try all possible combinations and select the one with the best performance (e.g., rebuffering rate). In practice, continuous probing of all combinations is impractical. Therefore, we extrapolate the performance based on observed data from similar clients, considering attributes like ISP, location, device, and time-of-day. We follow previous work on non-parametric prediction [24, 33] with some simplifying modifications.

We make two simplifying assumptions:
- Bitrate selection is not considered in this section.
- Session outcomes are independent, and CDN performance does not degrade with load. These assumptions will be relaxed in Section 5.2.

Our approach has two logical stages: estimation and extrapolation, which we describe next.

### Video Control Plane Overview

A centralized control plane for optimizing content delivery is not a new concept and has been used within CDNs and ISPs for server selection and content placement [12, 13, 36]. However, our approach introduces two key differences:
1. **Cross-CDN Optimization**: Combining cross-CDN optimization with bitrate selection/adaptation.
2. **Midstream Switching**: Focusing on midstream switching of both parameters, whereas most CDN optimizations focus only on start-time selection.

As a starting point, we assume that the control plane operates per content provider, such as YouTube or Hulu, to monitor and improve the video experience for their customers. Interaction issues between multiple providers and controllers are discussed in Section 7.

Figure 6 shows a high-level overview of the three key components in the video control plane:
1. **Measurement Component**: Actively monitors the video quality of clients.
2. **Performance Oracle**: Uses historical and current measurements to predict the potential performance for a particular combination of CDN and bitrate.
3. **Global Optimization Engine**: Assigns the CDN and bitrate for each user based on the measurement and performance oracle.

### Key Components and Challenges

#### Measurement Engine
- Periodically collects quality statistics for active users.
- The client-side player reports these statistics every few seconds, including video quality metrics (e.g., buffering, join time, average bitrate).
- Collects user and session attributes (ISP, location, current CDN, player version) to aid in performance prediction.
- The challenge is to choose the right granularity of attributes and quality metrics and to determine the appropriate reporting frequency.

#### Performance Oracle
- Predicts the potential performance for different CDN and bitrate combinations.
- Answers "what-if" style questions to guide the control plane in making optimal decisions.

#### Global Optimization Engine
- Uses the measurement and performance oracle to assign the best CDN and bitrate for each user.

### Estimation and Extrapolation

#### Estimation
- For each set of attribute values, compute the empirical performance distribution for the metric of interest (e.g., rebuffering ratio).
- Compare distributions to determine the best performance.

#### Extrapolation
- Identify the parameter with the best performance distribution for a specific attribute value.
- Extrapolate the best possible performance by drawing from the empirical distribution.
- Address data sparsity using a hierarchical approach, considering coarser attribute combinations when fine-grained data is insufficient.

### Improvement Analysis

For this analysis, we selected two popular providers that use multiple CDNs but do not explicitly optimize based on observed quality. This ensures unbiased potential improvement.

#### Validation
- Validate the extrapolation by creating a synthetic dataset with randomly assigned CDNs to ensure no spurious improvements are predicted.

#### Average Improvement
- Compute the average improvement in video quality over a one-week period.
- Figure 8 shows significant improvements in buffering ratio, join time, and failure rate for Provider1, while Provider2 already has good delivery quality.

#### Improvement Under Stress
- Analyze potential improvements during extreme scenarios where CDNs perform poorly.
- Results show dramatic improvements in buffering ratio and failure rate under stress conditions.

### Main Observations
- Better CDN selection can significantly improve video delivery quality.
- Specific improvements include more than 2× in mean buffering ratio and startup time, and 10-32× in buffering ratio and failure rate under stress.

### Toward a Practical Design

The previous section establishes the potential for improvement. In practice, the control plane must consider the impact of bitrate, CDN load, and future performance predictions. We present a preliminary effort to address these issues, aiming to establish a feasible and concrete control plane rather than an "ideal" one.
