• Port mirroring (using a firewall filter-based method) at the [edit forwarding-options port-mirroring
instance] hierarchy
• Native analyzer at the [edit forwarding-options analyzer] hierarchy
NOTE: You can configure both of the preceding methods on the same device. See "Sample
Configuration Results" on page 1238 for an example.
The following address families are supported in 1:N port mirroring:
• ethernet-switching
• inet
• inet6
Here are the limitations that you need to keep in mind as you configure the feature:
• Next-hop group members can be Layer 2 only, not Layer 3.
• You can configure next-hop-group output support only for local port mirroring—that is, not for remote
port mirroring or for remote port mirroring to an IP address (GRE encapsulation).
• You can configure as many as 4 next-hop groups, and you can add up to 4 interfaces to each next-
hop group. You must define at least 2 destinations to send packets to more than one destination;
however, you can define just one destination in a next-hop group.
Table 124 on page 1235 lists the configuration-hierarchy combinations you use to build your 1:N
mirroring topology:

Features of Packet Mirroring with Layer 2 Headers for Layer 3 Forwarded Traffic | 1240
Limitations for the Packet-Level Mirroring Configuration | 1240
This document focuses on a capability to select traffic using a wide variety of IPv4 or IPv6 filter match
conditions and to mirror entire packets with their original Layer 2 header information.
Layer 2 header information might be essential to identify a specific customer in an edge router
deployment or a specific Internet peer in a public peering case.

Features of Packet Mirroring with Layer 2 Headers for Layer 3 Forwarded Traffic
In a nutshell, you can mirror the original Layer 2 packet header when the l2-mirror action is configured in
a family inet or family inet6 filter. Packets can be mirrored locally or remotely by using GRE tunnels.
If you specify the output interface in your mirroring configuration as a GRE tunnel interface, packets are
encapsulated in GRE before transmission. A port-mirroring instance can be configured with multiple
output protocol families.
Limitations for the Packet-Level Mirroring Configuration
• The new action, l2-mirror, is only supported for family inet and family inet6filters.
• Layer 2 mirroring is not supported on gr-*/*/* interfaces.
Configure a Filter with a Port-Mirroring Instance or with Global Port Mirroring
You configure l2-mirror under either firewall family (inet | inet6) filter filter-name term then port-mirror
(global port mirroring) or firewall (inet | inet6) filter filter-name term then port-mirror-instance instance-
name (port-mirroring instances, or "PM instances").
Having l2-mirror configured for a term indicates that for packets matching this term, the Layer 2 packet
is mirrored. The software performs commit checks for invalid configurations, such as when l2-mirror is
configured but no port-mirroring output interface is configured for family any in the global-level or
instance-level port mirroring configuration. If you deactivate l2-mirror, the mirroring behavior reverts to
Layer 3 mirroring.
The following two examples show the configuration of a filter (the filter name in the examples is f1) with
a port-mirroring instance and with global port mirroring. In both examples traffic is mirrored to the
remote destination over a GRE tunnel.
NOTE: The port-mirroring configurations, which are under forwarding-options, are configured with
family any, but the match conditions in the filter configuration are done under family inet. Using
family any enables the mirroring of Layer 2 packets.
1. To configure the filter with a port-mirroring instance:
NOTE: You can specify a gr- interface as your mirror destination. See Configuring Generic
Routing Encapsulation Tunneling on ACX Series for information on configuring gr- interfaces
1241
(the document refers specifically to ACX Series routers; the same information applies to
various other routers, including MX10003.)

2. To configure the filter with global port mirroring:

input {
rate 2;
}
family any {
output {
interface gr-0/0/0.0;
}
}
}
}

tcp-flags "(syn & fin & rst)";
}
1243
then {

}
}
}
}
}
interfaces {
gr-0/0/0 {
unit 0 {
tunnel {
source 10.1.1.2/32;
destination 10.1.1.1/32;
}
family bridge {
interface-mode access;
vlan-id 100;
}
}
}
}
routing-instances {
i1 {
instance-type virtual-switch;
interface gr-0/0/0.0;
bridge-domains {
bd100 {
vlan-id 100;
}
}
}
}
Configure Mirroring for FTI Tunnels
When the data path traverses a flexible tunnel interface (FTI) tunnel, the output packet is sent with
tunnel encapsulation. You can set up a configuration that mirrors the original packet as well as the
packet with all encapsulations as it egresses out.
To mirror the original packet, configure input mirroring on the ingress WAN interface.
To mirror the packet with all encapsulations, enable output mirroring on the egress WAN interface.
1244
To enable mirroring based on a filter installed on the FTI interface, you use a two-step process:
1. You mark packets for mirroring using the policy action at the fti- interface. The policy action is
typically used to select the egress rewrite rule, but in this case, the policy action is used to mark
interesting packets with an internal policy attribute, without any special rewrite rule configured.
2. You have the software intercept packets that match the specific policy on the egress WAN side and
initiate the l2-mirror action. Packets are reported with Layer 2 header information, including tunnel
encapsulation.
NOTE: The following example shows Layer 3 port mirroring. To obtain Layer 2 port mirroring,
simply configure the l2-mirror action as shown in the preceding examples in this document.
1. Define policy-map policy-map-name under the class-of-service stanza:
class-of-service {
policy-map {
pm1;
}
}
2. Apply an output filter on the FTI with action policy-map pm1:
family inet {
filter mirror-all {
term mirror {
from {
policy-map pm1;
}
then {
count all;
port-mirror-instance mirror-to-gre;
accept;
}
}
term default {
then accept;
}
}
filter f1 {
term t1 {
1245
from {
source-address {
10.1.1.2/32;
}
}
then {
policy-map pm1;
count c1;
}
}
term t2 {
from {
source-address {
10.36.100.1/32;
}
}
then accept;
}
}
}
3. The following configuration output shows the FTI configuration on interface fti0.1001. (For more
detail on configuring an FTI tunnel, see Flexible Tunnel Interfaces Overview.)
interfaces {
fti0 {
unit 1001 {
tunnel {
encapsulation vxlan-gpe {
source {
address 198.51.100.1;
}
destination {
address 198.51.100.2;
}
tunnel-endpoint vxlan;
destination-udp-port 4789;
vni 22701;
}
}
family inet {
filter {
1246
output f1;
}
address 10.18.1.1/27;
}
family inet6 {
address 2001:db8::1:1/126;
}
}
}
}
4. Add a filter (here named mirror-all) on the egress WAN interface with match from policy-map pm1 then
port-mirror:
family inet {
filter mirror-all {
term mirror {
from {
policy-map policy-map-name;
}
then {
count all;
port-mirror-instance mirror-to-gre;
accept;
}
