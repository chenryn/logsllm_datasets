User: How to build a highly available web application?
Assistant: To build a high-availability web application, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Architecture design: choose an appropriate architecture, such as distributed architecture, micro-service architecture, etc., to ensure that the system has scalability, high concurrency and high load capacity. 2. Database: Choose a database with strong scalability and high reliability, such as distributed database, cloud database, etc. At the same time, the database needs to be load balanced and backed up to ensure data security and data availability. 3. Server configuration: use load balancing technology to evenly distribute requests to multiple servers to ensure server availability. At the same time, it is necessary to monitor and maintain the server, and detect and deal with server failures in time. 4. CDN technology: CDN technology can be used to distribute static resources to nodes around the world, improving user access speed and availability. 5. Disaster recovery backup: Establish multiple data centers and backup servers to ensure the system has disaster recovery and fault tolerance capabilities. 6. Monitoring and log: Establish a monitoring system and a log system to monitor the system's operating status in real time, and find and deal with problems in a timely manner. 7. Security protection: Establish security policies and protection mechanisms, strengthen the system's security protection capabilities, and ensure system security and availability.
