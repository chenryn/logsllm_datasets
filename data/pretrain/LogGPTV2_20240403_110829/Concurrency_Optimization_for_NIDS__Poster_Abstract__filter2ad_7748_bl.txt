season The fresh truffle samples were assessed at three time intervals; 0, 7 and 14 days to monitor the changes in the metabolite profile of the 
truffles during storage The results showed that 64 compounds were identified in all of the truffle samples at all time points 11 key compounds 
showed significant changes between time points including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 2,4-dithiapentane In addition, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 
as well as 2,4-dithiapentane are compounds only found in white truffles (Tuber Magnatum) The findings of this study will provide truffle growers an 
insight on the impact of truffle aging on the aromatic qualities of truffles Further studies are currently in progress to improve the preservation of the 
truffle aroma

During the production of olive oil an important amount of wastes are generated In last few years, their reutilization via recovery of polyphenolic 
fraction has attracted an increasing attention Currently, the market of olive-based dietary supplements is composed of a broad range of natural 
extracts claiming different health effects and often sold without a clear statement on their chemical composition The aim of the present study 
was to characterize the chemical profiles of a range of different olive-based dietary supplements Such products were analyzed via untargeted 
metabolomics, using liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (Orbitrap LTQ-XL), in order to explore their composition 
PCA revealed a clear separation of samples according to the type of product (first component, 40% variance) and also according to the part of the 
olive-plant used (17% variance) The first component clearly divided gemmotherapy products from the other ones Most of phenolics were present 
in these products in lower concentration (or not present) The second component was the one that separated the products according to the part 
of the olive plant used in their formulation, the fruits from the leaves A Student’s t-test was performed in order to select the putative biomarkers 
discriminating among the observed classes Finally, most promising biomarkers were annotated, and the ones identified at level 1 were also 
quantified via HPLC Alliance DAD-QDa MS (Waters) The data produced with this study is suitable to support the unambiguous classification of the 
olive-based dietary supplements Funding: Operational Plan “POFESR 2014/20” (Autonomous Province of Trento)

Food Intake Biomarkers for Increasing the Efficiency of Dietary Pattern Assessment through the Use of Metabolomics: 
Unforeseen Research Requirements for Addressing Current Gaps
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cristina Andres-Lacueva, University of Barcelona, Spain
CO-AUTHORS: Mar Garcia-Aloy, Raul González-Domínguez
Current research on nutritional sciences depends upon the precise measurement of food intake Despite being the most widely used dietary 
measurement tools, self-reported surveys are not exempt from already recognized limitations1,2,3 Low dietary assessment accuracy contributes 
to the inconsistency of results already observed in many instances when trying to understand the connections between diet and healthiness or 
disease risk, thereby weakening their potential translation to clinical and public health applications2 The drawbacks of conventional instruments 
have encouraged research on food intake biomarkers (FIBs) as a complementary or alternative measure of dietary intake, being one of the 
cornerstones of nutritional epidemiology2 Accurate dietary assessment is a challenge in nutritional research, needing powerful and robust tools for 
reliable measurement of food intake biomarkers In this work, we have developed a novel quantitative dietary fingerprinting (QDF) approach, which 
enables for the first time the simultaneous quantitation of about 350 urinary food-derived metabolites, Thus, this metabolomic approach represents 
one-step further toward precision nutrition and the objective of improving the accurateness and comprehensiveness in the assessment of dietary 
patterns and lifestyles 1 J Agric Food Chem 2018, 66, 5-7 2 Trends Food Sci Technol 2017, 69, 220−229 3 Curr Opin Food Sci 2017, 16, 96−994

Cognitive performance is related to glucose metabolism and metabolic activation that are regulated by diet We studied the effects of a brain-
friendly diet (Brainfood) on metabolic and physiological parameters and cognitive performance in office workers at assumed metabolic risk 
We conducted a diet-switch, 4-week intervention study on 84 volunteers with elevated plasma LDL levels in pre-screening The Brainfood diet 
focused on regular meal frequency and optimal intake of polyunsaturated fats, fibre and salt, whereas the control diet was a typical western diet 
Plasma samples were collected at the end of the lead-in, control and intervention periods, and analysed using high-throughput NMR spectrometry 
for quantification of lipoprotein subclasses and particle sizes, cholesterol, glycerides, phospholipids, apolipoproteins, fatty acids, amino acids, 
ketone bodies, fluid balance, glycolysis and inflammation markers A non-commercial mobile healthcare device recorded ECG, optical pulse 
plethysmography, accelerometric signal and thoracic impedance Cognition was measured with standardized neuropsychological tests (Bourdon-
Wiersma, FAT, N-Back, NASA-TLX, KSS, RAVLT, Stroop, WMS-III, Task-switching) under a psychologist’s supervision and as tablet, PC or online tests 
Brainfood reduced saturated fat and salt intakes and increased polyunsaturated fat, fibre, vitamin C and D, iron and magnesium intakes Favourable 
effects were seen in the atherogenic lipid measurements, such as fatty acids, LDL, IDL and small VLDL, as well as fatty acids, phospholipids and 
glutamine Intervention did not affect the physiological or cognitive parameters except for a decrease in inaccuracy of visual attention (p=0027) 
The Brainfood diet could be recommended for office workers as a healthy diet following Nordic Nutrition recommendations

Background: Promising results from pre-clinical and clinical research support a potential role for berries and their associated phytochemicals in 
the prevention of oral cancer Strawberries are a significant dietary source of berry phytochemicals Our group recently conducted a randomized, 
cross-over, placebo-controlled clinical study, in which subjects consumed strawberries powder (24 g/day) and a placebo product, each for 7 days 
Objective/Hypothesis: Our objective was to investigate key markers of strawberry exposure in the urine of healthy individuals and individuals 
at high risk for oral cancer (smokers) using metabolomics Methods: Urine samples from 9 smokers and 10 non-smokers following placebo and 
strawberry interventions were volumetrically normalized according to osmolality and chemically profiled using UHPLC-QTOF-MS Data were 
modeled using multilevel, multivariate analyses to capitalize on the cross-over design of the study Results: A total of 41 markers were found, 
26 of which were elevated following strawberry treatment and 15 following the placebo Using ion fragmentation and comparison to authentic 
and synthesized standards, we identified metabolites elevated with the strawberry intervention including urolithin A (and phase II metabolites), 
dihydroxybenzoic acids, and phase II metabolites of strawberry aroma compounds Markers of placebo consumption included phase II metabolites 
of flavorants and a metabolite of colorants included in the formulation Conclusions: Distinct metabolic profiles pertaining to strawberry and placebo 
treatment arms were observed and provide targets for validation These findings will inform future clinical trials with strawberry products with regard 
to potential markers of exposure and implications of study design on metabolomic profiles

Identifying Natural Compounds as Inhibitors of Quorum Sensing Transcriptional Regulator (SdiA) of Klebsiella pneumoniae 
through Modelling, Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mohamed Alajmi, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia
CO-AUTHORS: MD Tabish Rehman
Bacteria can communicate amongst themselves through cell-cell signalling system; quorum sensing (QS) Gram-negative bacteria detect 
N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) signalling molecules through LuxR transcriptional regulators Certain bacteria do not produce signalling 
molecules but can detect the signals produced by other bacterial species through SdiA (suppressor of cell division inhibition) SdiA is a homolog 
of LuxR transcription regulator and thus regulates AHL-mediated transcription of various virulent genes In the present work, we employed a 
computational biology approach to identify novel inhibitors of SdiA by screening natural compounds First, we modelled the structure of SdiA using 
Modeller using 4LFU as template (646% sequence identity and 100% coverage) ProCheck, Verify3D, Ramachandran plot scores (>995% residues 
in the favourable and allowed regions) and ProSA-Web (Z-score=-845) have been employed to ascertain the good quality of the generated SdiA 
model RMSD between SdiA model and 4LFU template was estimated to be 021 Å The secondary structural contents of SdiA model was predicted 
using PDBsum Further, CASTp identified only one pocket as the most probable binding site of SdiA (area=523083 Å2 and volume=351044 Å3) 
Autodock Vina was employed to perform high throughput virtual screening (HTVS) on a library of natural compounds available at InterBioScreen 
Ltd The potential inhibitors were again docked on SdiA using flexible docking in Autodock Further, molecular mechanics-general born surface area 
(MM-GBSA) was used to evaluate the effect of solvent on protein-ligand complex stability Finally, molecular dynamics simulation was performed on 
the two best inhibitors to confirm the potential of the identified inhibitors against SdiA

PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mee Youn Lee, Konkuk University, South Korea
CO-AUTHORS: Mee Youn Lee, Han Sol Seo, Digar Singh, Sang Jun Lee, Choong Hwan Lee
Ginseng berries (GBs) show temporal metabolic variations among different maturation stages, determining their organoleptic and functional 
properties We analyzed metabolic variations concomitant to five different maturation stages of GBs including immature green (IG), mature green 
(MG), partially red (PR), fully red (FR), and overmature red (OR) using mass spectrometry (MS)–based metabolomic profiling and multivariate 
analyses The PLS-DA score plot based on GC–MS datasets highlighted metabolic disparity between preharvest (IG and MG) and harvest/
postharvest (PR, FR, and OR) GB extracts along PLS1 (349%) with MG distinctly segregated across PLS2 (182%) Forty-three significantly 
discriminant primary metabolites were identified encompassing five developmental stages (VIP > 10, p  10, p < 005), with most displaying 
higher relative abundance during preharvest stages excluding ginsenosides Rg1 and Re Furthermore, we observed strong positive correlations 
between total flavonoid and phenolic metabolite contents in GB extracts and antioxidant activity Comprehending the dynamic metabolic variations 
associated with GB maturation stages rationalize their optimal harvest time per se the related agroeconomic traits

Environmental factors such as excessive dietary intake have a critical role in the pathogenesis of life style-related diseases including diabetes 
and obesity; nutrition education contributes to the prevention of these diseases Novel biomarkers of dietary intake are required to apply nutrition 
education effectively To identify biomarkers of macronutrient intake, we have used a metabolomics approach As a pilot study, we performed 
metabolomic analysis using human samples after test meal (Terumeal(R)) After intake of the test meal, increases and/or decreases in peaks 
detected by LC/MS analysis were distinguished in human plasma and urine samples Correlation analysis of the metabolomic data of the test 
meal itself and the human samples revealed that many components derived from Terumeal(R) could be detected, and that the values were altered 
time-dependently after meal in human samples Based on findings from this study, we established a protocol for the development of biomarkers of 
macronutrient intake Next, we performed metabolomic analysis using human samples after white rice or white bread intake as representatives of 
carbohydrate, a component of macronutrient Samples in 8 healthy volunteers were taken 7 times over a period of 24 hours Increases in peaks by 
LC/MS analysis were detected after bread intake but were not detected after rice intake in human plasma samples Components derived from bread 
or its derivatives modified in the body were detected in human plasma samples after bread intake Thus, integrated analysis of metabolome data 
both in human samples and various food compositions revealed candidates for biomarkers of macronutrient intake

Using different untargeted GC-MS trapping techniques reveals the comprehensiveness of volatile compounds in  
flavouring ingredients
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Carmen Diez Simon, Wageningen UR, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Roland Mumm, Robert D. Hall
Metabolomics has become a valuable data-driven, holistic approach that is able to generate novel hypotheses, identify novel biomarkers and 
elucidate underlying modes of action Whereas metabolomics has been applied to diverse plant materials, applications in processed foods is still 
in its infancy, especially in relation to flavour aspects Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that metabolomics has great potential to identify 
sensory-relevant compounds From this, it became evident that existing technologies have huge potential but need further development to obtain 
robust analytical data for complex food products We have developed methods for the untargeted analysis of volatiles from process flavours The 
challenge lies in developing optimal headspace trapping techniques that give the most comprehensive picture together with an efficient and robust 
detection of volatiles A number of volatile trapping techniques including solid-phase microextraction (SPME), stir-bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), 
and dynamic headspace (DHS) were compared for their relative values and robustness for the analysis of the volatiles present Results showed 
that the techniques differ in their efficiency in trapping of different classes of volatile compounds suggesting a need to tailor the volatile extraction 
technique depending on the specific composition of the process flavour Methodologies have been developed which: deliver robust data on 
sensory-relevant compounds; allow for identifying unknown (Maillard-related) compounds that contribute to the prediction of sensory attributes 
and; give us deeper insights into the most relevant chemical reactions Acknowledgements: The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from NWO,

Urinary Metabolomic Profiling to Identify Biomarkers of Carrot Intake
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Siva Charan Sri Harsha Pedapati, University College Dublin, Ireland
CO-AUTHORS: Roshaida Abdul Wahab, Lorraine Brennan
Metabolomics has emerged as a key technology to identify novel food-intake biomarkers in a range of foods The objective of this research was to 
identify urinary biomarkers of carrot intake using an untargeted metabolomics approach In this context, a randomized cross-over acute intervention 
study was conducted on eleven participants who consumed carrots (Test food) and turnips (control food) in random order Urine samples were 
collected postprandially and analysed by UPLC-QTOF-MS The data obtained was reduced to 3148 features in positive mode and 3015 features in 
negative mode applying filtering procedures such as data alignment and sample occurrence frequency Robust PLS-DA models were obtained when 
comparing fasting samples with 12h (R2X=0725, Q2=0331) time point post-consumption of carrots The variable importance for the projection (VIP) 
list was created from PLS-DA plots with scores ≥15 considered as discriminant features between the two time points Time series plots revealed 29 
features (15 in positive mode and 14 in -ve mode) with a time response following carrots consumption with 11 features demonstrating a differential 
time course compared to the control food Ferulic acid 4-sulphate (m/z 2730074), Pyrocatechol sulphate (m/z 1889864), N-Feruloylglycine (m/z 
2510721), L-Tyrosine (m/z 1820802) were identified as metabolites reflective of carrot intake using databases such as METLIN, HMDB and confirmed 
by LC-MS/MS Future work will focus on confirmation of the remaining discriminating features and examine dose response relationship to ascertain 
biomarker validity Overall, the untargeted metabolomics approach developed proved to be successful in the identification of urinary markers of 
carrot intake

Australian native plants and their application in food
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Sara Ghorbani Gorji, School of Agriculture and Food Sciences, The University of Queensland, Australia
CO-AUTHORS: Sara Ghorbani Gorji, Siyuan Chen, Zhenzhen Li, Melissa Fitzgerald
Australia has a diverse native flora, that contains plants that have been used as food or medicine by Indigenous people for many thousands of 
years However, to date Western knowledge about the properties of these plants is limited, and where information is available, it is clear that 
these plants offer unique properties in terms of flavour and nutritional value Recently, there have been many reports about the nutritional value 
of Indian turmeric (Cucurma longa) In Northern Queensland, a native Australian turmeric (Cucurma australasica) is found, and it is reported that 
Indigenous people roast and consume the rhizomes In this study we have explored the rhizomes of Australian native turmeric for the presence 
of phytochemicals important to human health, unique flavours, and nutritional properties, and compared these with the traditionally consumed 
Indian turmeric rhizomes With the aid of metabolomics, the phytochemical, volatile compounds and minerals of Australian and Indian turmeric 
were studied Various antioxidant assays were used to compare the antioxidant activity The potential of using Australian turmeric in niche products 
such as turmeric latte or confectionary was also studied Sensory analysis provided new insights about the application of Australian turmeric in the 
market Our results showed that the Australian turmeric has comparable nutritional value to Indian Turmeric and furthermore, consumers preferred 
Australian turmeric over Indian turmeric in a formulation for turmeric latte This research helps to understand potential applications of Australian 
native turmeric, ultimately increasing its economic value, and offering a native competitor to the now highly sought Indian turmeric

UPLC-Orbitrap-MS and GC-TOF-MS based Metabolomics Analysis on the differentiation of Red Ginseng of Two Different 
Geographical Origins
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Ailsa Chui-Ying YUEN, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong
CO-AUTHORS: Siu-Wai WAN, Tung-Ting SHAM, Chi-On CHAN, Daniel Kam-Wah MOK
Red ginseng (also called Hongshen in Chinese) is the steamed dried root and rhizome of Panax ginseng CA Mey and is a famous Chinese medicine 
for tonifying qi The northern part of China and South Korea are two main cultivation areas of red ginseng, and ginseng produced in these locations 
differs in qualities and thus in their market prices too Previous studies have used hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios to differentiate 
ginseng collected from these two locations However, this technique requires specialized instrument and does not provide information about the 
quality of red ginseng Meanwhile, the analysis of ginseng mainly focuses on its ginsenoside content, however, it could be affected by various 
factors such as the steaming process, age and the part of the ginseng (main or lateral root) In this study, red ginseng samples collected from 
China and Korea were extracted using the modified Bligh and Dyer’s liquid-liquid extraction method with subsequence analysis using GC-TOF-
MS (aqueous layer) and UPLC-Orbitrap-MS (organic layer) Multivariate analysis was carried out to identify the key metabolites for differentiating 
between red ginseng from these two locations Our results showed that carbodiimide, propionic acid, disaccharide (maltose, fructose, sucrose), 
ginsenoside Re, Rf, Notoginsenoside R2 could be tentatively identified as the metabolites to differentiate between ginseng from these two origins 
The results suggested that the metabolomic profile of red ginseng could provide more comprehensive information to differentiate between Chinese 
and Korean red ginseng

Metabolomics-based Approach for the Evaluation of Post-Harvest Quality of White Leg Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) 
Cultured in Different Salinity
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Eiichiro Fukusaki, Osaka University, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Sri Hayati, Julie Ekasari, Sastia P. Putri
Shrimp is one of the most important commodities in aquaculture industry and has important significance in global food supply Salinity plays an 
essential role in shrimp aquaculture and is considered to affect post-harvest quality (physical and sensory attributes) However, there is no study 
on the correlation between salinity and metabolite profiles The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of different salinity on physical 
and sensory attributes, and metabolome of white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) As an initial analysis, shrimp was cultured in different salinity 
(10, 20, 30 ppt) for ten weeks under controlled condition and were subsequently analyzed for physical attributes (texture and color analysis), 
sensory analysis, and untargeted GC/MS analysis The result for texture profile analysis showed that there is an increase trend in springiness and 
cohesiveness value along with increase of salinity level Moreover, color measurement showed that ∆L*(lightness-darkness) and ∆b*(yellow-blue) 
score showed a positive trend along with increase of salinity, and thus both of texture and color could be used as a reference for selected sensory 
attributes GC/MS based metabolme data were subjected to Principle Component Analysis to clalify the important metabolites varying depending 
on salinity change to be several amino acids The findings from this study provide an insight on the effect of different salinity towards metabolite 
composition of shrimp and can act as a useful feedback for shrimp aquaculture industry

Discovering the flavor of the fine flavor cocoa of Piura/Peru
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Madina Mansurova, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, Peru
CO-AUTHORS: Stephanie Michel, Alfredo J. Ibañez
Flavor and aroma are the most important characteristics of chocolate and is key to determining the final price that the customer is willing to pay for 
the product Peru is one of the countries that produces and exports the finest cocoa beans (Fine Flavor Cocoa, or FCC), and the chocolate as a final 
product In this project we have developed an analytical method based on mass spectrometry to identify the volatile compounds profile responsible for 
the fine flavor of the Peruvian chocolate from Piura Furthermore, we have observed the development of those taste markers during the manufacturing 
of the chocolate from cocoa beans Finally, we cross-correlated the results of our measurements with the quality control team of the FCC-based 
chocolate company to corroborate with a panel the taste markers that we have detected molecularly In summary, our methodology allowed us to 
map chemical compound patterns that represent the flavor and aroma of the final product (chocolate), making it possible to differentiate it from other 
ordinary cocoa chocolates, as well as from other fine flavor chocolate producers with different cacao origin or different manufacturing Hence, this 
approach can be applied to other chocolate producers, as well as other food products to define, analyze and quantify flavor and aroma compounds 
This information would be of great help for those companies whose sale price depends on their organoleptic characteristics
