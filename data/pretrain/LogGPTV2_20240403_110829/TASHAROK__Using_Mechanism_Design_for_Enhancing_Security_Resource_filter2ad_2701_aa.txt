Abstract—We consider interdependent systems managed by
multiple defenders that are under the threat of stepping-stone
attacks. We model such systems via game-theoretic models and
incorporate the effect of behavioral probability weighting that is
used to model biases in human decision-making, as descended
from the field of behavioral economics. We then incorporate
into our framework called TASHAROK, two types of tax-based
mechanisms for such interdependent security games where the
central regulator incentivizes defenders to invest well in securing
their assets so as to achieve the socially optimal outcome. We first
show that due to the nature of our interdependent security game,
no reliable tax-based mechanism can incentivize the socially
optimal investment profile while maintaining a weakly balanced
budget. We then show the effect of behavioral probability
weighting bias on the amount of taxes paid by defenders, and
prove that higher biases make defenders pay more taxes under
the two mechanisms. We then explore voluntary participation
in tax-based mechanisms. To evaluate our mechanisms, we use
four representative real-world interdependent systems where we
compare the game-theoretic optimal investments to the socially
optimal investments under the two mechanisms. We show that the
mechanisms yield higher decrease in the social cost for behavioral
decision-makers compared to rational decision-makers.

I. INTRODUCTION
Today’s interdependent systems face sophisticated attacks
from external adversaries where the attacker aims to breach
specific critical assets within the system [1], [2]. Such attacks
pose a serious danger to large-scale critical infrastructure (e.g.,
the massive supply chain attack on SolarWinds in 2020 [3]
and the recent Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May
2021 [4]). Such attacks have motivated several attempts to
improve the cyber security of these systems [1], [5], [6],
[7], [8]. Several challenges exist for these improvements.
System operators often have limited security budgets that they
need to allocate wisely within the systems they manage to
reduce security risks. Moreover, coordination in large-scale
systems that are composed of many interdependent subsystems
managed by different operators is challenging as each operator
has her local priority of securing her own subsystem.
Prior work has considered such security decision-making
problems in both decision-theoretic [9], [10], [11], [12] and
game-theoretic settings [13], [14], [15], [16]. The crux of the
problem is that the security risk (usually captured by the
probability of successful attack on system’s critical assets)
faced by a defender depends on her own security investments
as well as those of other defenders securing subsystems that
are interdependent with her subsystem. However, most existing
work has relied on classical models of decision-making, where
all defenders and attackers are assumed to be fully rational
decision-makers [13], [16], [17].

humans consistently deviate from these classical models
of decision-making. Most notably, research in behavioral
economics has shown that humans perceive gains,
losses
and probabilities in a skewed, nonlinear manner [18]. In
particular, humans typically overweight
low probabilities
and underweight high probabilities, where this weighting
function has an inverse S-shape, as shown later in Figure 2.
Many empirical studies (e.g., [19], [18], [20]) have provided
evidence for this class of behavioral models. These effects
are relevant for evaluating the security of interdependent
systems in which decisions on implementing security controls
are not made purely by automated algorithms, but rather
through human decision-making, albeit with help from threat
assessment tools [12], [21]. The prevalence of human factors
in security decision-making has been recognized through
popular press articles [22], [23] and in academic studies [24],
[25], [26]. Recent research has also shown that cybersecurity
professionals’ risk perceptions are as susceptible to systematic
biases as those of the general population [27], [28] and related
behavior of system-administrators securing systems [29].
Recent work has begun to model and predict the effect of
behavioral decision-making on security investments [25], [30],
[31], [32], [33]. However, none of this research sheds light
on the mitigation of such cognitive biases and these works
have only studied specific interdependent games. In contrast,
we consider general defense allocation techniques that can be
applied to any system whose failure scenarios are modeled
by an attack graph. We consider tax-based mechanisms to
guide behavioral decision-makers towards enhancing their
security investments and incentivize them to achieve socially

reduce the overall security risk.
Fundamentally, our framework, TASHAROK1, identifies the
effects of behavioral bias on the design of mechanisms for
improving security decisions in interdependent systems.
Throughout our paper, we consider two classes of defenders.
Behavioral defenders: These defenders make security
investment decisions subject
to the nonlinear probability
weighting cognitive bias, found in prospect-theoretic models.
They misperceive the probabilities of a successful attack on
each edge of the attack graph of the system network.
Non-behavioral (rational) defenders: These defenders make
security investment decisions based on the classical models of
fully rational decision-making. Thus, they correctly perceive
the probability on each edge within the attack graph.
Problem setup and mechanism design:
In this paper, we model a security setup of interdependent
systems with multiple defenders. Each defender is responsible
for defending a subnetwork of

such interdependent systems, stepping-stone attacks are often

targets. These

the whole network.
i.e.,
We first show the difference between the Pure-Strategy
Nash Equilibrium (PNE)2 investments (by both rational and
behavioral defenders) and the socially optimal investments via
multiple motivating examples. We then design two tax-based
mechanisms that enhance security investment decision-making
for our interdependent security games. Such mechanisms use
monetary payments/rewards to incentivize socially optimal

those minimizing the sum of
the costs of all defenders due to a security attack. The two
tax-based mechanisms are the ‘Externality’ mechanism [35]
and the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (‘VCG’) mechanism [36].
These mechanisms enhance the implemented security policy
by incentivizing defenders to allocate their limited security
resources to minimize the system’s social cost.

comparison with four prior solutions for optimal security
controls with attack graphs [25], [12], [38], [9]. In conducting
our analysis, we address several domain-specific challenges
in the context of
systems.
These include augmenting the attack graph with certain
parameters such as edges’ sensitivity to security investments
(Equation 2), estimation of baseline attack probabilities
(Table II), modifying mechanism formulations
for our
interdependent security games (Section V), and incorporating
behavioral biases in our formulations (Section II).
Key insights:
Abstracting from the details, we provide three hitherto
unknown insights into the security of interdependent systems.
1) A social planner (e.g., government agency) can achieve
much lower security loss than each defender acting on
her own. The difference increases when security defenders
have more cognitive biases (Figure 9). The global planning
is beneficial even if the planner is behavioral (Example 1).
However, if the degree of interdependency is slight, then
there is no need to go to the complexity of setting up central
regulation — each defender acting independently (selfishly)
achieves close to the optimal security (Figure 10(a)).
2) Our work supports recent proposals for companies to buy
cyber insurance as part of their risk management strategy.
In such process, the company would pay a tax (determined
by the regulator depending on the system architecture
(Figure 12)) and then transfer the financial risks related
to network and computer incidents to that regulator.
3) Behavioral decision-making leads to suboptimal resource
allocation and thus tax-based mechanisms can be more
helpful in a system with behavioral defenders compared to
non-behavioral (rational) decision-makers (Figure 11). In
such mechanisms, we prove that behavioral biases make
defenders pay more taxes compared to rational defenders.
In summary, this paper makes the following contributions:
1) We propose a security investment guiding technique for
defenders of interdependent systems whose assets have
