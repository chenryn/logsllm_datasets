two researchers and some wording was changed to make the survey specific for
process navigation. All items were measured using a seven-point Likert-type
scale with anchors from ”Strongly disagree” (which mapped to 1) to ”Strongly
agree” (which mapped to 7). The survey included one item worded with proper
negation. Items were shuffled to reduce monotony of questions measuring the
same construct.
3.2 Setup and procedure
The subjects were students of the Department of Informatics Engineering, Uni-
versity of Coimbra. Before the experiment, subjects had a one semester intro-
ductorycourseonInformation Systems Management.Inthelastweekofclasses,
subjects were asked to give their opinion on the use of process navigation as a
way to help them manage process models in the future.
The concept of a process navigation system was described to subjects using

After all participants had listen and understood the UI mockups, the exper-
imenter shortly introduced the format of the survey and the survey was handed
out. The survey was identical for all subjects. The subjects did not receive any
textual description of the mockups.
As soon as every subject received the survey, they were asked to start filling
outthequestionnaire.Theexperimenterstayedintheroomforthewholeexper-
iment assuring there was no collaboration among the subjects. Subjects could
leave the room as soon as they were finished and every subject finished within
15 minutes. There were no limits on time.

which are marked with a star in the Figure; e.g. a bar showing KPIs, icons, and the
visual outline of the signs for next steps was improved.

endofa14weekssemester.Duringthefirstfourweeksofthesemester,students
were taught Business Process Management (e.g. state diagrams, workflow nets,
Petri nets, tasks, activities, cases, control-flow, etc.). During the reminding of
the semester, process models from ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure
Library) were also covered. At the time the survey was completed, students had
a good knowledge of (business) process modeling and management. The sample
consisted of 7% female and 93% male students with an age between 22 and 26
years. All the students (100%) were from Computer Science. No tests for colour
blindness or visual acuity were conducted.
3.4 Analysis and findings
Prior to the assessment of the survey, guidelines for screening missing data and
outliers were followed. The 14 usable questionnaires were examined for missing

number of subjects, no other tests were carried out.
Descriptive statistics showed that subjects have ranked the process naviga-
tion approach high in the items PU, PEOU, ATU, and BI. Most common an-
swerstothequestionspertainingtheseitemsincludedI strongly agree,I agree,I
somewhat agree. Table 1 shows the median of the answers. Results suggest that
subjects agree with the usefulness and perceived use of the metaphor since the
median for most questions was 6, i.e. subjects have given the answer I agree.
Subjects have also a positive attitude toward using a system implementing the
metaphor, and believe that if such a system would exist they would use it.

The main objective of the prototype was to further study how mobile workers

were significantly influenced by the interpretation of the meaning of the naviga-
tion metaphor by subjects, the prototype allows us to study how the metaphor
isperceived.Forinstance,wecanvisualizearbitrarycasestoprocessworkerson

effects of applying the navigation metaphor to process management on mobile
devices, the desktop controller application does not (yet) comprise a workflow
engine that automatically derives the next situation to be shown to users. In-
stead,thesimulationismanuallycontrolledandsituationsmaybeeitherdefined
dynamically or loaded from configuration files.
This basic simulation process is shown in Figure 4. It starts with the launch
of the controller application on a PC which needs to be connected to the same
networkasthemobiledevices(orwhichisreachablefromtheinternetviaitsIP
address). Then, the simulation front-end is started on Android powered mobile
devices. Upon its start, the simulation front-end will try to establish a connec-
tion to the controller. Afterwards, the simulation supervisor may load a specific
workflow case, update it to its specific needs and transmit it to connected front-
ends. If a completely new situation is to be created, this may also be achieved
by the supervisor using the controller application. It is important to note that

the controller itself is not meant to be used as a solution for process modeling;
instead, it allows for creating single tasks with a graphical user interface.
Upon receiving a specific case, the front-ends will set up the corresponding
visualization. Subjects can introspect it, interpret the labels and descriptions,
andmakeadecisionaboutwhattodonextbyinteractingwiththeirdevice(e.g.
by touching the label of one of the alternatives shown on screen). This decision
is then send back to the controller and visualized to the supervisor. It is then
his responsibility to switch to the next situation in the workflow.

Even though both, architecture and the basic simulation process, were im-
plemented in a very simple manner, they allow for studying the first important
results relevant to the interaction of agents within a distributed, mobile work-
flow execution environment. First, the prototype shows our concept of how a
workflow instance may be visualized following the navigation metaphor as de-
scribed in earlier sections. It has some limited flexibility because of its current
status, such as it only provides a detailed view on a specific case but not (yet)
an overview of the whole process instance such that it supports taking single
decisions but does not outline the route up to the destination. Second, it shows
that the interaction between concurrently acting workflow agents need to be
considered more closely. Even though agent selection and notification may be
considered a standard feature of modern workflow management systems, the
mobile scenario adds another level of complexity to the underlying problem in
which agents may be temporarily disconnected from a central server instance.

the selection of a following task but no updates on the status of data or other
workflow resources.

The applicability of the car navigation metaphor to workflow systems has been
first discussed in [12]. In our work, we take one step forward and explore how it
can be used to guide the development of mobile workflow solutions.

instances are not visualized. The approach sees large processes as maps and the

Navigator for visualizing process models. While the idea is interesting, so far,
it only enables to represent models using a 3D view. Since process models are

of a 3D representation, except, possibly, the hierarchical visualization of sub-

process modeling using virtual environments. The system relies on Second Life,
a head mounted display, and enables the modeling of processes using BPMN.
While this work contrasts with ours since we target the navigation of process
models and instances, the results are relevant since preliminary data indicates
that users interact well with virtual environments. Vankipuram et al. [14] rely
on virtual world replay to visualize critical care environments. Our approach is
distinct since we target the use of metaphors with a high degree of acceptance
among end users for navigation applied to mobile devices.
Hackmann et al. [6] present a BPEL execution engine (called Sliver) which
supports a wide variety of devices ranging from mobile phones to desktop PCs.
The challenge of the work done was to demonstrate that mobile devices are
capable of hosting sophisticated workflow/groupware applications. Leoni and
Mecela [10], in contrast, describe a distributed workflow management system
that runs on mobile devices (in this case on the Windows Mobile platform),
that relies on BPEL for its execution logics. Following the traditional task list

6 Conclusion
Research indicates that new workflow paradigms for mobile devices can be in-
spired from the TomTom metaphor. Therefore, we have established an isomor-
phism between navigation and workflow systems which aggregates mappings in
three categories: (1) topology of route networks, (2) the connectivity of maps,
and (3) landmarks. Afterwards, we have conducted an acceptance evaluation to
determine if end users would use a workflow system implementing a car naviga-
tion metaphor. The results were encouraging and led to the implementation of
a first prototype. We believe that the isomorphism will enable users to reapply
their knowledge from the domain of driving to the domain of workflow manage-
ment and, thus, will facilitate the navigation of process models and instances.
Our future work will focus on the implementation of additional features and to
carry out a more complete system evaluation.
