ATT&CK ID:T1628.001
ATT&CK Technique Name:Suppress Application Icon
A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher. This hides the fact that it is installed, and can make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions.
