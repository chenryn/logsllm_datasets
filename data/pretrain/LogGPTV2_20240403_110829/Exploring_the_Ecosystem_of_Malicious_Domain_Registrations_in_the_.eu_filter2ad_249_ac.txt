Fig. 7. Times of registrations for campaign c 19. Note the impact of daylight saving
time starting from the last Sunday of March.
As listed in Table 3, we encounter a few cases where registration ﬁelds belong-
ing to the same registrant vary typographically inside a single campaign.
In campaign c 15, we also observed registrant names for which the name
ﬁeld has been ﬁlled inconsistently, leading to name patterns such as Lastname
Lastname or Firstname Firstname Lastname.
Table 3. Minor inconsistencies found in the registration details campaign domains.
Some registration details have been obfuscated for privacy reasons.

Adaptive Registration Strategies. Several campaigns alter their strategies
throughout their lifetime. For instance, ﬁve campaigns have registered domains
via multiple registrars: c 01, c 03, c 11, c 12 and c 16. Figure 8 illustrates how
campaign c 11 sequentially changes between 4 registrars over the entire duration
of the campaign. Malicious actors might change registrars for economic reasons
(cheaper domain registrations) or to evade detection. Alternatively, the change
in registrar can be triggered by an intermediate reseller that changes registrar.
Table 4 lists for each campaign the amount of adaptive registration details
that were used throughout its lifespan. While ﬁve campaigns use just a single
phone number and email address, the large majority leverage multiple registra-
tion details. The email providers that are categorized as “Campaign” indicate
that a domain name that was registered as part of the campaign, was later used
as the email provider for a new registration.
As primary indicators of evasion sophistication, we list two metrics. Firstly,
we give the maximum number of domains for which a campaign has reused a

single phone number or email address. Secondly, we measure the longest period
during which a registrant’s phone or email address has been reused. c 15, c 12
and c 8 demonstrate the highest sophistication in terms of minimizing the reuse
of registrant details. However, c 15 uses many diﬀerent self-registered email
providers and only reuses details sparsely over a long period. In other words,
they leverage a more elaborate strategy than c 12 and c 8, where registrant
details seem to be automatically generated in a hit-and-run fashion The success
of c 15’s strategy is supported by its low blacklist presence. In contrast, c 2, c 11
and c 18 deploy exhibit more simple and high-volume strategies.

providers used per campaign.
