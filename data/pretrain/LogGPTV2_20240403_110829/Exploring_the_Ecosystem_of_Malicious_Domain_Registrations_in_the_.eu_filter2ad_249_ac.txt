### Figure 7: Times of Registrations for Campaign c19
Note the impact of daylight saving time, which starts from the last Sunday of March.

### Inconsistencies in Registration Details
As listed in Table 3, we encounter a few cases where registration fields belonging to the same registrant vary typographically within a single campaign. For example, in campaign c15, we observed registrant names where the name field has been filled inconsistently, leading to patterns such as "Lastname Lastname" or "Firstname Firstname Lastname."

#### Table 3: Minor Inconsistencies Found in Registration Details (Campaign Domains)
| Attribute | Inconsistencies |
|-----------|-----------------|
| c04 street | P.O BOX 3...4 |
| c11 city | AIX EN PROVENCE |
| c11 street | 1... ROUTE D AVIGNON, 1... ROUTE D’AVIGNON |
| c16 street | 947 C...R, 9457 C...R |
| c11 city | AIX-EN-PROVENCE |

**Note:** Some registration details have been obfuscated for privacy reasons.

### Adaptive Registration Strategies
Several campaigns alter their strategies throughout their lifetime. For instance, five campaigns (c01, c03, c11, c12, and c16) have registered domains via multiple registrars. Figure 8 illustrates how campaign c11 sequentially changes between four registrars over the entire duration of the campaign. Malicious actors might change registrars for economic reasons (cheaper domain registrations) or to evade detection. Alternatively, the change in registrar can be triggered by an intermediate reseller that changes the registrar.

**Note:** The email providers categorized as "Campaign" indicate that a domain name registered as part of the campaign was later used as the email provider for a new registration.

### Indicators of Evasion Sophistication
We list two primary metrics to indicate evasion sophistication:
1. **Maximum Number of Domains Reusing a Single Phone Number or Email Address**
2. **Longest Period During Which a Registrant’s Phone or Email Address Has Been Reused**

Campaigns c15, c12, and c8 demonstrate the highest sophistication in minimizing the reuse of registrant details. However, c15 uses many different self-registered email providers and only reuses details sparsely over a long period, indicating a more elaborate strategy. This is supported by its low blacklist presence. In contrast, campaigns c2, c11, and c18 deploy simpler, high-volume strategies.

### Conclusion
The analysis of the registration data reveals that malicious actors employ various adaptive strategies to avoid detection. These strategies include changing registrars, using multiple phone numbers and email addresses, and minimizing the reuse of registrant details. Understanding these tactics is crucial for developing effective countermeasures.
