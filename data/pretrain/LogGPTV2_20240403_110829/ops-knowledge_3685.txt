User: So, I want the long_description of my setup script to be the contents from my README.md file. But when I do this, the installation of the source distribution will fail since python setup.py sdist does not copy the readme file.
Is there a way to let distutils.core.setup() include the README.md file with the sdist command so that the installation will not fail?
I have tried a little workaround where I default to some shorter text when the README.md file is not available, but I actually do want that not only PyPi gets the contents of the readme file but also the user that installs the package.
Assistant: To manually include files in a distribution do the following:

set include_package_data = True
Create a MANIFEST.in file that has a list of include <glob> lines for each file you want to include from the project root. You can use recursive-include <dirname> <glob> to include from sub-directories of the project root.

Unfortunately the documentation for this stuff is really fragmented and split across the Python distutils, setuptools, and old distribute docs so it can be hard to figure out what you need to do.
