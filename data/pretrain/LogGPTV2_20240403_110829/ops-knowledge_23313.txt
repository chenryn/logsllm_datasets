For example, to search for all files named 'myfile.txt' in the global file index, you can use the following command: ``` locate myfile.txt ``` Note: Before using the locate command for the first time to search, you need First use the updatedb command to update the global file index. 3. grep: Search for the specified text in the file content. For example, to search for files containing the text 'hello world' in all files in the current directory, use the following command: ``` grep -r 'hello world' . ``` where the -r option instructs grep to be in a subdirectory Search recursively. '.' means to search the current directory. 4. rg: similar to grep, but faster.
