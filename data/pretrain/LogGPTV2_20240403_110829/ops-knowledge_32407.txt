User: I have installed both versions of python that is python 2.7 and python 3.5.3. When I run python command in command prompt, python 3.5.3 interpreter shows up. How can I switch to python 2.7 interpreter?
Assistant: It depends on OS (and the way Python has been installed).
For most current installations:

on Windows, Python 3.x installs a py command in the path that can be used that way:

py -2 launches Python2
py -3 launches Python3

On Unix-likes, the most common way is to have different names for the executables of different versions (or to have different symlinks do them). So you can normally call directly python2.7 or python2 to start that version (and python3 or python3.5 for the alternate one). By default only a part of all those symlinks can have been installed but at least one per version. Search you path to find them
