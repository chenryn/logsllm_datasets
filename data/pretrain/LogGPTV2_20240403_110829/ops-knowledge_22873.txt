User: My application caches some data on disk.  Because the cache may be large, it should not be stored on a network drive.  It should persist between invocations of the application.  I have a mechanism for the user to choose a location, but would like the default to be sensible and "the right thing" for the platform.
What is the appropriate location for such a cache?  Is there an API for determining the appropriate location?  How do I call it from Python?
Assistant: Does the app have any preferences, settings or options that the user can specify? If so, add an option where the user can specify the location of the data, with a default of the current Windows temp directory.
There's always a chance they may not have enough space on the drive with the temp directory, and would need to use a different drive/directory.
