User: How to use the Git version control system to manage and collaborate on code development?
Assistant: The following are the steps for code management and collaborative development using the Git version control system: 1. Install Git: First, you need to install the Git version control system on the local computer. You can download it from the official website, and follow the prompts to install and configure it. 2. Create a warehouse: Use Git to create a new code warehouse, you can use the following command: `git init`. In the process of creating a warehouse, Git will automatically create a `.git` subdirectory for the code warehouse to store version information and history records. 3. Add files: To add files or folders that need to be version controlled to the warehouse, you can use the following command: `git add [file]`. You can also use `git add *` to add all files to the repository. 4. Submit the code: Use Git to submit the code to the local code warehouse, you can use the following command: `git commit -m "commit message"`. Among them, `commit message` is a brief description of the code submission. 5. Create branches: Git can create multiple branches to develop at the same time, you can use the following command: `git branch [branch-name]`. where `branch-name` is the name of the new branch. 6. Switching branches: During code collaborative development, you need to switch between different branches, you can use the following command: `git checkout [branch-name]`. Among them, `branch-name` is the name of the branch to switch to. 7. Merge code: When the development of new functions is completed, it needs to be merged into the main branch, and the following command can be used: `git merge [branch-name]`. Among them, `branch-name` is the name of the branch that needs to be merged. 8. Push code: In the process of collaborative development, you need to push your own code to the remote code warehouse, you can use the following command: `git push origin [branch-name]`. Among them, `origin` is the name of the remote code warehouse, and `branch-name` is the name of the branch to be pushed. The above are the basic steps for code management and collaborative development using the Git version control system. It should be noted that when using Git for code management, you should always maintain a complete development history and follow good collaborative development norms and processes.
