Preface
On behalf of the program committee, it is our pleasure to present to you the
proceedings of the Fifth Symposium on Recent Advances in Intrusion Detection
(RAID). Since its ﬁrst edition in 1998, RAID has established itself as the main
annual intrusion detection event, attracting researchers, practitioners, and ven-
dors from all over the world.
The RAID 2002 program committee received 81 submissions (64 full papers
and 17 extended abstracts) from 20 countries. This is about 50% more than last
year. All submissions were carefully reviewed by at least three program commit-
tee members or additional intrusion-detection experts according to the criteria
of scientiﬁc novelty, importance to the ﬁeld, and technical quality. Final selection
took place at a meeting held on May 15–16, 2002, in Oakland, USA. Sixteen full
papers were selected for presentation and publication in the conference procee-
dings. In addition, three extended abstracts of work in progress were selected for
presentation.
The program included both fundamental research and practical issues. The
seven sessions were devoted to the following topics: anomaly detection, stepping-
stone detection, correlation of intrusion-detection alarms, assessment of intrusion-
detection systems, intrusion tolerance, legal aspects, adaptive intrusion-detection
systems, and intrusion-detection analysis.
RAID 2002 also hosted a panel on “Cybercrime,” a topic of major concern
for both security experts and the public.
Marcus J. Ranum, the founder of Network Flight Recorder, Inc., delivered a
keynote speech entitled “Challenges for the Future of Intrusion Detection”.
The slides presented by the authors and the panelists are available on the
RAID 2002 website, http://www.raid-symposium.org/raid2002/
We sincerely thank all those who submitted papers as well as the Program
Committee members and the additional reviewers for their eﬀorts. Special thanks
go to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich for hosting this year’s
edition of the RAID Symposium.

Detecting Long Connection Chains of Interactive
Terminal Sessions

Abstract. To elude detection and capture, hackers chain many
computers together to attack the victim computer from a distance.
This report proposes a new strategy for detecting suspicious remote
sessions, used as part of a long connection chain. Interactive terminal
sessions behave diﬀerently on long chains than on direct connections.
The time gap between a client request and the server delayed ac-
knowledgment estimates the round-trip time to the nearest server.
Under the same conditions, the time gap between a client request
and the server reply echo provides information on how many hops
downstream the ﬁnal victim is located. By monitoring an outgoing
connection for these two time gaps, echo-delay comparison can identify
a suspicious session in isolation. Experiments conﬁrm that echo-delay
comparison applies to a range of situations and performs especially well
in detecting outgoing connections with more than two hops downstream.
Keywords: Stepping stone, connection chain, intrusion detection, com-
puter security, network security, network protocol, terminal session, de-
layed acknowledgment, reply echo, echo delay.
1 Introduction
Network security and intrusion detection have become important topics of ac-
tive research [1,4,5,3]. As the use of the Internet becomes more common and
widespread, so have network attacks and security breaches. Because the growing
number of network attacks is ever more costly, network security and intrusion
detection now play a crucial role in ensuring the smooth operation of computer
networks.
1.1 Motivation
A skilled computer hacker launches attacks from a distance in order to hide his
tracks. Before launching an actual attack with noticeable consequences, a skilled
hacker will break into many computers across many political and administra-
tive domains, to gather computer accounts. With access to multiple computer

accounts, the hacker can chain these computers through remote sessions, using
the intermediate computers in the chain as stepping stones to his ﬁnal victim.
