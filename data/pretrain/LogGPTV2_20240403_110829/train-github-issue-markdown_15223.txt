#### Challenge Name
http://beta.freecodecamp.com/en/challenges/basic-css/change-the-color-of-text
#### Issue Description
When using inline style to change the h2 element to the color red, my output
says "try again" and that I need to change the h2 color to red. I have tried
both inline style and using style tags.
UPDATE: this also occurred a few challenges later, when directed to change h2
elements to 'blue' using CSS. Could possibly be an issue with the rest of the
'Basic CSS' section.
