User: I can't seem to figure out how to zoom in or anything, and the font is so small. Thank you for your help. I'm using a mac if that helps
Assistant: On the top menu, choose Options, then Configure IDLE.  The Fonts/Tabs tab will be displayed.  There is a Size button.  Click on it and select a bigger size than the default of 10.  At present, this only only affects the font in Shell, editor, and output windows, but that is the main issue for me.
EDIT: correct Options menu entry as suggested by Nathan Wailes.  IDLE Preferences was once the title of the resulting dialog, but it is now Settings.
