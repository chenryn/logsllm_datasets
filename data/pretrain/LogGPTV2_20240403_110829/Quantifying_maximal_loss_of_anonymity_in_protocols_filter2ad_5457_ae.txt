Using Proposition 4.2 we get the channel capacity(in bits):
d(h1(1−λ0−λ1)+h2(1−λ0+2λ1)+(h3+h4)(1−λ0)) = 1.354

7.2 Anonymity: the impact of network con-
k
nectivity
In an onion network each individual router can allow or
disallow connections from other routers. Using the same
additional constraint as in the previous case study, we set oﬀ
to investigate the relationship between the connectivity and
the loss of anonymity in an onion network. This can be the
basis to understand quantitatively how much connectivity
an onion network needs to have to achieve a certain level of
anonymity.
In this case, the connection from node 2 to node 4 is re-
moved, as shown in Figure 4. The additional constraint is
maintained:
h1 = 2h2

The observable outputs and corresponding probabilities
are listed in Table 6. From the table, we can get o using

With the constraints the system has only one solution
h1 = 0.2488, h2 = 0.1244, h3 = 0.2834, h4 = 0.2834
λ0 = −0.2609, λ1 = 0.1155
Using Proposition 4.2 we get the channel capacity in a sim-
ilar way (in bits)
d(h1(1−λ0−λ1)+h2(1−λ0+2λ1)+(h3+h4)(1−λ0)) = 1.819
Notice there is hence a diﬀerence of 0.54 bits between 1.891
and 1.354 as in the previous case study, which is due to the
reduced connectivity of the second network. As the intuition
suggests, if there is better connectivity and generally more
paths to choose from, then there will be higher entropy with
respect to the observations, and better anonymity can be
achieved. This example shows that our techniques can be
used to measure the impact from certain parameters of a
protocol on the loss of its anonymity.
7.3 Anonymity: Knowing the path length
In this section, we are going to show how the Theorem 4.3
and Proposition 4.4 can be applied to study the impact of
tuning the path length in Onion Routing.
In an onion network, suppose the protocol sets the length
of the path which is also known to the attacker. In this case,
the path length is represented by additional, “low” informa-
tion in theoretical terms.
For illustration, we use the same case as in Figure 4 with-
out any constraint. Here Rj represents the probability that
a path has a length of j. For example, we use R2 for the
path 1 → 2 → R because the length is 2.
We will show that the channel capacity hereby derived will
be a linear combination of Rj, which implies that tuning Rj
will eﬀectively change the channel capacity.
In this case, the constraints are only built up from the
joint probability of the input:X
(hi, Rj) = Rj
i
For this example, the observable outputs and corresponding
joint probabilities are listed in Table 7. Here the secret is
listed in the ﬁrst column as before; the path lengths are
either 2 or 3 which are interpreted as R2 and R3 in the
second one; the probabilities (os, Rj) are (hi, Rj) because
each pair has diﬀerent output.
From Table 7, each input pair (hi, Rj) produces diﬀerent
outputs, thus the conditional probabilities φ is:
φi,j,k = 1
From o and φ and Theorem 4.3 we deduce that the channel

Using Proposition 4.4 we get the channel capacity:
λkfi,j,k) = R2 + 2R3 bits
i,j,k
k
which is a linear combination of R2 and R3. For example, if
we assume R2 = R3 then the corresponding channel capacity
is
R2 + 2R3 = 1.5 bits
In fact, when Rj is introduced into the system of equations,
the solution of the system of equations becomes a linear
combination involving Rj. The channel capacity (maximal
anonymity loss) is then a linear function of Rj. Therefore,
ideally we can ﬁnd an optimum probabilistic distribution of
the path length that will result in the best anonymity.
An important implication is that it becomes possible to
tune the parameters within the protocol (e.g. path length)
to automatically adapt to dynamic properties of the anony-
mity system (e.g. possible location and distribution of ad-
versaries and level of connectivity). It is beyond the scope of
this paper to discuss the speciﬁc algorithms used by Onion
Routing, however we believe an opportunity clearly exists
to improve such protocols in the light of our analysis.
8. CONCLUSION
This paper introduced Lagrange multipliers to analyse the
channel capacity in anonymity protocols. The constraints in
the Lagrange method are shown to have a practical relevance
e.g. in reﬂecting real properties of networks, in quantifying
the design weaknesses in anonymity protocols, but also to
specify and analyze the impact of properties like network
connectivity.
We believe our work, as a theoretical framework, is ac-
curate, useful and feasible. We applied the methodology
to analyze three diﬀerent protocols. More applications can
certainly be found in such areas like communications, voting
and auctions.

Scalability: The solution of system of equations can be
very costly as the number of unknown (constraints) grows.
There is a wealth of knowledge in the literature on eﬃcient
solutions to systems of equations which we haven’t explored
so far.
Inequality and Nonlinear Constraints: In this paper
we have dealt with constraints expressed as linear equa-
tions. We are currently working on the use of nonlinear
constraints. Further, to deal with inequalities as constraints
we need to use a generalization of the technique known as
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions.
Probabilistic analysis: A comparison of the information
theoretical and probabilistic analysis of anonymity protocols
would be very interesting. For example It would be interest-
ing to compare our analysis with the probabilistic analysis
of Onion routing presented in [14].
