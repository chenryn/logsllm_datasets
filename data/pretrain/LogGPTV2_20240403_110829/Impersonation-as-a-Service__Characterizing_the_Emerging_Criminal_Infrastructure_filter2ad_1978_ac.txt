### Accounts and Crawling Strategies

The accounts used in our study were not linked to each other, suggesting that market operators maintained a high level of crawling-detection efforts during our activities. To mitigate this issue, we employed several strategies to access specific pages and resources on ImpaaS.ru. As noted in [11], direct URL access (as opposed to navigating through the website) can trigger anomalies in crawler monitoring systems. Therefore, we operationalized all crawling activities through browser instrumentation, configuring the crawler to mimic human activity patterns (e.g., timeouts between requests proportional to the length of the visited webpage, taking breaks, etc.). This setup allowed us to silently crawl the market without detection or the banning of our remaining accounts.

### Data Collection and Datasets

While the above strategy was necessary, it made it impossible to gather complete information on resources due to the large number of requests (Lim-3). Consequently, we created two datasets:

1. **Full Database**: This dataset includes information on approximately 262,000 user profiles on ImpaaS.ru, including infection and update dates, prices, the number of browsers for which resources are available, the number of collected fingerprints, and the number of stolen cookies.
   
2. **Sampled Database**: This dataset adds resource information to a random selection of approximately 5% (n = 13,512) of the user profiles available on the market. Initially, the fraction was set to 10%, but approximately half of the selected profiles were removed from the market during the data collection process.

The collected data is available for sharing with the research community at [https://security1.win.tue.nl](https://security1.win.tue.nl).

### Analysis Procedure

The data analysis in Section 5 is divided into two subsections:
- **Section 5.1**: Provides an overview of the data collected in the Full dataset, characterizing ImpaaS.ru operations by examining its evolution, victim profile characteristics, profile updates, and pricing.
- **Section 5.2**: Analyzes the distribution and effect of resources on pricing, as reported in the Sampled database. Standard sanity checks, such as regression results, are performed on all analyses. Reported logarithms are natural logarithms unless otherwise specified.

### Manual Resource Classification

To factorize the types of resources reported in the Sampled database, we manually classified each resource into one of six categories. Table 2 lists these categories and their definitions. The classification was done by one of the authors over 454 unique platforms. The other author independently classified a random sample of 100 platforms, achieving an agreement score of 89%. After review, conflicts were resolved, and the classification was updated accordingly. Additional random checks did not reveal any remaining mismatches.

### Ethical Considerations and Limitations

No personally identifiable information is included in our dataset. IP addresses of victims are masked on the platform, and no detailed information about the victims is available without purchasing a user profile. For ethical reasons, we did not purchase any user profiles. This limitation means we do not have access to the software bundle provided by ImpaaS.ru and cannot ascertain the quality or operative aspects of the IMPaaS service. However, we can provide a full evaluation of the data available to the attacker when browsing for victims.

### Data Analysis

#### Overview of Collected Datasets

**Full Dataset**:
- **Collection Period**: December 2017 to March 2020
- **Number of User Profiles**: Approximately 262,000
- **Browser Distribution**: Most profiles target only one browser, with the top 5% targeting three browsers. Only 35 profiles report data for more than six browsers.
- **Cookie Distribution**: Skewed similarly to browser distribution.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Profiles are distributed globally across 213 countries.
- **Price Range**: From 0.7 to 96 USD; 50% of the profiles cost at most 5 USD, while the priciest 5% are priced above 20 USD.

**Sampled Dataset**:
- **Collection Period**: March 2018 to March 2020
- **Number of User Profiles**: 5.2% (n = 13,512)
- **Resource Information**: Detailed information on available resources, with an average profile having upwards of 30 resources. Most resources are of type "Services," while "Social" and "Commerce" are less common. Cryptocurrency and money transfer resources are the least numerous.

### Overview of ImpaaS.ru Operations

To provide an overview of the IMPaaS operations, we first examine the Full dataset. Approximately 12% of all profiles are not associated with a browser on the victimâ€™s system, and these profiles do not allow for impersonation attacks under the IMPaaS model. We exclude these from further analysis. The number of available real fingerprints is surprisingly low, with only 4.3% of the available profiles having at least one. This suggests that real fingerprints, available browsers, cookies, and resources could be the driving force behind ImpaaS.ru activities.

Figure 2 provides an overview of the geographic distribution of user profiles and their median price per country. Most profiles belong to users in the United States and Europe, with a high fraction of EU countries showing volumes similar to those of the US. Users in Asian and African countries are comparatively less affected. ImpaaS.ru does not provide profiles for users in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan (CIS countries). Median prices vary from country to country rather than at a macro-regional level. For example, EU median prices are higher in Spain (m = 9.55, sd = 9.07) and the UK (m = 8.3, sd = 7.5) compared to Germany (m = 7.21, sd = 8.21) and Finland (m = 6.96, sd = 6.68). Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests confirm that profile prices in Spain and the UK are significantly higher than in Germany and Finland.
