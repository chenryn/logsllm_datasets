accounts were not linked to each other in any way,4 suggesting
that market operators have kept their crawling-detection efforts
high during our activities. To mitigate this problem we employed
different strategies to access specific pages and resources to crawl
on ImpaaS.ru: as already noted in [11], accessing URLs directly
(as opposed to via website navigation) may generate anomalies in
crawler monitoring systems. For this reason, we operationalised all
crawling activities through browser instrumentation, and config-
ured the crawler to mimic activity patterns compatible with those
3Whereas a full list of the probed features is not available from ImpaaS.ru nor from
our analysis (see section 4), a number of commercial and free solutions could be
employed by the ImpaaS.ru malware to implement reliable fingerprinting of the
infected systems.
4The first two accounts were obtained from a single member of ImpaaS.ru and active
on Torum. The other accounts all came through invitation codes generated by either
different market members, or released by ImpaaS.ru operators themselves to different
and unrelated accounts we control on Crdclub.

of a human user (e.g. timeouts between requests proportional to
the length of the visited webpage, taking breaks, ...). With this final
setup, we finally managed to silently crawl the market avoiding the
detection and ban of the remaining accounts in our possession.
While necessary, the above strategy makes it impossible to gather
complete information on Resources due to the exploding number
of requests (Lim-3). This results in two datasets:
‚Ä¢ Full database includes information on approximately 262‚Ä≤000
user profiles on ImpaaS.ru, including (infection, update)
dates, prices, number of browsers for which resources are
available, number of collected fingerprints for that user pro-
file, and number of stolen cookies.
‚Ä¢ Sampled database adds Resources information to a ran-
dom selection of approximately 5% (ùëõ = 13‚Ä≤512) of the user
profiles available on the market.5
The collected data is available for sharing to the research com-
munity at https://security1.win.tue.nl.
4.3.1 Analysis procedure. The data analysis in Section 5 is split
in two subsections: in Sec. 5.1 we provide an overview of the data
collected in the Full dataset, and characterize ImpaaS.ru op-
erations by looking at its evolution, victim profile characteristics,
profile updates, and pricing; in Sec. 5.2 we analyse the distribution
and effect of Resources on pricing, as reported in the Sampled
database. Standard sanity checks (e.g. on the regression results
presented in Sec 5.2) are performed on all analyses. Reported loga-
rithms are natural logarithms unless otherwise specified.
Manual resources classification. To factorize the type of resources
reported in Sampled database in the analysis, we provide a clas-
sification of each resource in one of six categories. Table 2 lists
the employed categories and their corresponding definitions. The
classification was done manually by one of the authors over 454
5This fraction was originally set to 10%, however approximately half of the selected
profiles were removed from the market during the data collection process.

unique platforms for which Resources are reported in the dataset.
The other author independently classified a random sample of 100
platforms, reaching an agreement score of 89%; after review, con-
flicts were resolved and the classification was updated accordingly.
Additional random checks did not reveal any remaining mismatch.
Ethical considerations and limitations. No personally identifiable
information is reported in our dataset. IP addresses of victims are
masked on the platform, and no detailed information about the
victims is available without purchasing a user profile. For obvious
ethical concerns, we did not purchase any. Whereas this limits
our analysis in that we do not have access to the software bundle
provided by ImpaaS.ru, and cannot ascertain in detail the quality
or operative aspects of the IMPaaS service provided by ImpaaS.ru,
we are in the position of providing a full evaluation of the data is
available to the attacker when browsing for victims.
5 DATA ANALYSIS
Table 3 provides an overview of the collected datasets.
Full dataset. The data collection spans from Dec 2017 to March
2020, involving approximately 262‚Ä≤000 user profiles. Most user
profiles available on ImpaaS.ru target only one browser, with the
top 5% targeting three browsers. Only 35 user profiles report data for
more than six browsers in our data. Cookie distribution is similarly
skewed. Profiles are distributed globally across 213 countries6, and
prices range from 0.7 to 96 USD; 50% of the profiles cost at most 5
USD, whereas the priciest 5% are priced above 20 USD.
6Although there are only 195 recognized countries worldwide, ImpaaS.ru reports ISO
3166-1 codes, which do not distinguish sovereign nations from dependent territories.
Sampled dataset. This dataset reports data on 5.2% of the pro-
files available on ImpaaS.ru spanning from March 2018 till March
2020 (ùëõ = 13‚Ä≤512). For this dataset, we collected detailed infor-
mation regarding the available resources. As this is a random
sample, values are distributed similarly to Full dataset. Addition-
ally, we extract information on the number and type of resources
available for each profile. The average profile has upwards of 30 re-
sources; most resources are of type Services, whereas Social and
Commerce are less common. Cryptocurrency and Money transfer
resources appear to be the least numerous in a profile.
5.1 Overview of ImpaaS.ru operations
To provide an overview of the IMPaaS operations conducted in
the market we first look at the full dataset summarized at the top
of Table 3. Interestingly, we find that approximately 12% of all
profiles are not associated to a browser on the victim‚Äôs system.7
As these profiles do not allow for impersonation attacks under the
IMPaaS model, we remove those from further analysis. Relative to
the number of user profiles, the number of available real fingerprints
is surprisingly low, with only 4.3% of the available profiles having at
least one. Note however that this refers only to Real fingerprints
collected by the malware, not the Synthetic fingerprints that
can be synthesized from user data (ref. Sec.4.2). Nonetheless, this
suggests that (real) fingerprints, available browsers, cookies, and
resources could be the driving force behind ImpaaS.ru activities.
Figure 2 provides an overview of the geographic distribution of
the user profiles available on ImpaaS.ru and their median price
per country. Most of the profiles belong to users in the United
States of America and Europe, with a high fraction of EU countries
showing volumes similar to those of the US. Users in Asian and
African countries are comparatively less affected. As commonly
seen in Russian cybercrime markets [2], ImpaaS.ru does not pro-
vide profiles for users in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan
(CIS countries). Furthermore, with the exception of Chad and the
Central African Republic, the CIS countries appear to be some
of the only unaffected countries, globally. Overall, median prices
appear to vary from country to country rather than at a macro-
regional level. For example, EU median prices seem to be higher
in Spain (ùëö = 9.55, ùë†ùëë = 9.07) and GB (8.3, ùë†ùëë = 7.5) than in Ger-
many (ùëö = 7.21, ùë†ùëë = 8.21) or Finland (ùëö = 6.96, ùë†ùëë = 6.68). A set of
Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests evaluating the alternative hypothesis that
SP and GB profile prices are higher than DE and FI ones confirms
