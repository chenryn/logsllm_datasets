Question: An application uses AES encryption for sensitive data protection. The developers have decided to use user-supplied passwords directly as encryption keys. What are the potential security risks of this approach? (Select two.)
"A": "User-supplied passwords may not cover the full key space, leading to reduced encryption strength.",
"B": "The password's entropy is increased, making it more resilient against brute-force attacks.",
"C": "Direct use of passwords may lead to the use of a limited character set, decreasing the entropy.",
"D": "User-supplied passwords are always longer than the required AES key size, leading to performance issues."
Answer: AC
