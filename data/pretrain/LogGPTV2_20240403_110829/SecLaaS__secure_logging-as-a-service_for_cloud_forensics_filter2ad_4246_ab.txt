### Log Collection and Forensic Investigation in Cloud Environments

#### 1. Challenges in Log Collection
In a cloud environment, multiple layers such as the network, operating system, database, and application generate valuable logs for forensic investigations. Collecting these logs from various servers and layers and providing them to investigators in a secure manner is extremely challenging.

**Accessibility of Logs:**
Logs generated at different layers must be accessible to various stakeholders, including system administrators, forensic investigators, and developers. Each stakeholder requires specific log data:
- **System Administrators:** Need relevant logs to troubleshoot the system.
- **Developers:** Require logs to fix application bugs.
- **Forensic Investigators:** Need logs to aid in their investigations.

To ensure that each stakeholder gets exactly what they need, an access control mechanism is essential. This mechanism should provide only the necessary logs in a secure manner, preventing unauthorized access by malicious actors, such as cloud employees who might violate user privacy.

**Multi-tenancy:**
In cloud computing, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can share the same physical infrastructure, leading to co-located logs for different customers. This multi-tenant nature differs from traditional single-owner systems, making it challenging to collect and provide logs without mingling other users' data. An alleged user might claim that the logs contain information from other users. Therefore, the investigator must prove to the court that the provided logs belong to the malicious user while preserving the privacy of other tenants.

**Chain of Custody:**
The chain of custody is crucial in digital forensic investigations. It ensures that evidence is collected, analyzed, and preserved in a way that is admissible in court. In traditional forensics, this involves gaining physical control of the evidence. However, in cloud environments, this step is not feasible due to multi-jurisdictional laws, procedures, and proprietary technologies. Thus, collecting, analyzing, and presenting logs in cloud forensics must follow a clear chain of custody, detailing how logs were generated, stored, and accessed.

**Presentation:**
The final step in digital forensic investigation is presenting findings to the court. In cloud forensics, this is particularly challenging due to the complex structure of cloud computing. Proving the integrity of network and process logs in a way that is admissible in court is more difficult compared to traditional computer forensics.

### 2. Threat Model

#### 2.1 Definition of Terms
- **User:** A customer of the cloud service provider (CSP) who uses the CSP's storage service. Users can be either malicious or honest.
- **Log:** Any log generated in the cloud, such as network logs, process logs, or operating system logs.
- **Proof of Past Logs (PPL):** A proof that verifies whether certain logs belong to a particular user.
- **Investigator:** A professional forensic investigator who collects necessary logs from the cloud infrastructure during an incident.
- **CSP:** The Cloud Service Provider, responsible for generating PPL and providing log access through an API or management console.
- **Log Chain (LC):** Maintains the correct order of logs, ensuring that logs are presented in the actual order of generation.
- **Auditor:** Typically a court authority that verifies the correctness of logs using PPL and LC.
- **Intruder:** A malicious person, possibly a CSP employee, who aims to reveal user activity from PPL or log storage.

#### 2.2 Attackerâ€™s Capability
- **Users and Investigators:** Do not trust the CSP and can be malicious.
- **CSP:** Assumed to be honest when publishing PPL and LC but can collude with users or investigators to provide tampered logs.
- **Collusion:** Users, investigators, and CSPs can collude to provide fake logs to the auditor.
- **Intruders:** Can acquire PPL to learn about user activity or alter logs.

#### 2.3 Possible Attacks
- **Privacy Violation:** If PPL is published publicly, malicious individuals can acquire and analyze the logs. Even honest CSP employees with access to log storage can identify user activity.
- **Log Modification:** A dishonest CSP can modify, remove, or reorder logs to save a malicious user or frame an innocent one.
- **Repudiation by CSP:** The CSP can deny previously published PPL/LC.
- **Repudiation by User:** A malicious user can claim that the logs contain another user's data.

#### 2.4 System Properties
A secure log service for clouds should possess the following properties:
- **I1:** The CSP cannot remove a log entry after publishing the PPL.
- **I2:** The CSP cannot change the order of a log from its actual order of generation.
- **I3:** The CSP cannot plant false logs after-the-fact.
- **I4:** An investigator cannot hide or remove a log entry when presenting logs to the court.
- **I5:** An investigator cannot change the actual order of a log entry when presenting evidence.
- **I6:** An investigator cannot present phony logs to the court.
- **I7:** The CSP cannot repudiate any previously published proof of logs.
- **C1:** From the published proof of log, no adversaries can recover any log.
- **C2:** A malicious cloud employee will not be able to recover logs from the log storage.

### 3. The SecLaaS Scheme

#### 3.1 Overview
SecLaaS is a system for secure retrieval and storage of logs and proof of past logs. It ensures that logs are stored securely and made available to forensic investigators in case of attacks. Malicious activities of a VM can be detected from various logs generated in the Node Controller (NC). SecLaaS extracts and stores these logs in a persistent log database, ensuring integrity and confidentiality.

#### 3.2 Schematic Description
- **Log Entry (LE):** Extracted from different log sources.
- **Encrypted Log Entry (ELE):** Some fields of LE are encrypted using a common public key of security agencies.
- **Log Chain (LC):** Ensures the correct order of log entries using a hash-chain scheme.
- **Database Entry (DBLE):** Consists of ELE and LC.
- **Accumulator Entry (AE):** Stores the proof of DBLE.
- **Proof of Past Log (PPL):** Generated daily and published along with the CSP's public key.

#### 3.3 System Details
- **Log and Proof Insertion:**
  - **Parser Module:** Collects and parses logs from different sources.
  - **Logger Module:** Encrypts confidential information, creates the Log Chain, and prepares the DBLE.
  - **Proof Storage:** Stores the AE and updates the accumulator.
  - **PPL Generation:** At the end of each day, the logger generates and publishes the PPL.

- **Verification:**
  - **Integrity Verification:** Verifies the integrity of the proof and individual log entries.
  - **Order Verification:** Ensures the logs are in the correct order.

### 4. Conclusion
SecLaaS provides a robust solution for secure log collection and verification in cloud environments. By ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of logs, it addresses the challenges of multi-tenancy, chain of custody, and presentation in cloud forensics.
