  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I would expect that when I programmatically set the value of the multiline
TextField to '', the text inside it would disappear.
## Current Behavior
Currently, the previous value inside the multiline TextField is NOT being
cleared after setting the value to ''.
## Steps to Reproduce
You can directly reproduce the bug here: https://codesandbox.io/s/wwpojv800k
  1. Type something in the multiline TextField.
  2. Press the Reset button
Results:  
The content of the multiline TextField is not cleared.
Here is a very simple component you can directly add to your code to reproduce
the bug:
    import React from 'react';
    import TextField from 'material-ui/TextField';
    import Button from 'material-ui/Button';
    class Test extends React.Component {
        constructor() {
            super();
            this.state = {
                content: '',
            };
        }
        handleChange() {
            return (event) => {
                this.setState({content: event.target.value});
            };
        }
        resetContent() {
            this.setState({content: ''});
        }
        render() {
            return (
                    Reset
            );
        }
    }
    export default Test;
