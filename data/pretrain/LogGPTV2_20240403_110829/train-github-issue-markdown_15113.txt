It appears that you may have encountered a potential bug, or the result was not as expected. To illustrate this issue, I have created a fiddle demonstrating the problem.

Here is the code:

```javascript
// Definition of a shape (a 40x40 square)
const shape = new THREE.Shape();
shape.moveTo(0, 0);
shape.lineTo(40, 0);
shape.lineTo(40, 40);
shape.lineTo(0, 40);
shape.lineTo(0, 0);

// Convert the shape to geometry
const geometry = shape.makeGeometry();

// Material
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000, linewidth: 2 });

// Line
const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);

// Add the line to the scene
scene.add(line);
```

The issue is that the last segment of the square seems to be missing. Could you please confirm if this is the behavior you observed? If so, it might be worth checking if there are any known issues with the `THREE.Shape` and `THREE.Line` classes in the version of Three.js you are using, or if there are any additional configuration steps required.
