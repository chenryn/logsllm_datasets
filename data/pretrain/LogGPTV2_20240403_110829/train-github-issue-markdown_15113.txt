Not sure but I think this is a bug or I at least expected something else...
I made a fiddle here to demonstrate...
    // definition of a shape ( a 40x40 square)
    shape = new THREE.Shape();
    shape.moveTo( 0, 0 );
    shape.lineTo( 40, 0 );
    shape.lineTo( 40, 40 );
    shape.lineTo( 0, 40 );
    shape.lineTo( 0, 0 );
    // convert the shape to geometry
    var geometry = shape.makeGeometry();
    // material
    var material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial( { color: 0xff0000, linewidth: 2 } );
    // line
    line = new THREE.Line( geometry,  material );
    scene.add( line );
The last segment seems to be missing...
