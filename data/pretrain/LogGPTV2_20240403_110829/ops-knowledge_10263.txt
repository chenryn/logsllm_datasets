Certainly! Here is a more refined and detailed Kusto Query Language (KQL) query to identify the use of Image File Execution Options (IFEO) in conjunction with `.bat` files, specifically in the context of Wadhrama ransomware activity:

```kql
// Query to detect potential Wadhrama ransomware activity involving IFEO and .bat files

DeviceRegistryEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where RegistryKey has_any ("sethc", "utilman", "osk", "magnify", "narrator", "DisplaySwitch")
| where RegistryValueName == "Debugger" or RegistryValueName == "DebugFlags"
| where RegistryValueData has ".bat"
| extend RansomwareIndicator = iff(
    RegistryValueData has "Wadhrama",
    "Potential Wadhrama Ransomware Activity",
    "Unknown"
)
| project 
    Timestamp,
    DeviceName,
    ActionType,
    RegistryKey,
    RegistryValueName,
    RegistryValueData,
    RansomwareIndicator
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Explanation:
1. **Time Filter**: The query filters events from the last 7 days.
2. **Registry Key Check**: It looks for registry keys that are commonly targeted by IFEO modifications, such as `sethc`, `utilman`, `osk`, `magnify`, `narrator`, and `DisplaySwitch`.
3. **Registry Value Name Check**: It ensures that the registry value names are either `Debugger` or `DebugFlags`, which are typically used in IFEO settings.
4. **Registry Value Data Check**: It checks if the registry value data contains a `.bat` file reference.
5. **Ransomware Indicator**: It adds a custom column to indicate if the activity is potentially related to Wadhrama ransomware.
6. **Projection and Ordering**: It projects the relevant fields and orders the results by timestamp in descending order.

This query should help you identify and investigate potential Wadhrama ransomware activity involving IFEO and `.bat` files.
