### Zero-Inflated Poisson Models: Coefficients and Analysis

The coefficients of the zero-inflated Poisson models are presented in Tables 9 and 10. These models are used to analyze the data for first-time and existing users of the contract system, both during stable periods and during the COVID-19 period.

#### Table 10: Zero-Inflated Poisson Regression (First-Time and Existing Users of the Contract System)

### Discussion on Anonymization and Data Transparency

Given the nature of the marketplace, it is trivial to identify specific entities. Therefore, we have decided to reject the cover that trivial anonymization or pseudonymization would provide to this paper, while still protecting individual users and transactions. By avoiding the pretense that this forum is not identifiable, we shift the focus to an actual accounting of the potential harms associated with the different kinds of data and analysis presented.

This approach ensures a more transparent and honest representation of our findings, allowing for a more meaningful discussion on the implications and potential risks associated with the data.
