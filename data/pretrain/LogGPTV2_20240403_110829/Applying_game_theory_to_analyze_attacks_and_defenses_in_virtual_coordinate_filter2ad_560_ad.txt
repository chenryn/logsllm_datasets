temporal outlier detection. We now again consider spatial-
temporal outlier detection, however we consider that the spatial
outlier detection uses an adaptive threshold. We initialize the
spatial threshold with 2. In Table VI, we can see the Nash
equilibrium using Game 3 and Game 4 as deﬁned in Table I
in Section V-B. The different strategies are shown in Table III.
We note that we also compare the strategy c = 0, which means
that control theory is not used at all. Considering Game 3,
where we assume the attacker wants to disturb as much as
possible the correct functioning of the system with the effect
that the prediction error increases signiﬁcantly, the resulting
best attack method is to apply inﬂation attack with 30%
attackers with a probability of 0.54 and the oscillation attack
with 30% attackers with a probability of 0.46. For the defender
the best way to handle this attack method is to make use of
the constant c = 0.06 with a probability of 0.93, c = 0.08
with 0.07 probability, and the 75th percentile of the prediction
error for updating the closed-loop feedback control described
in Section IV-B.
In Game 4, we assume the attacker does not only intend
to harm the network as much as possible but that he wants
to remain undetected. With the resulting Nash Equilibrium we
can see that for the attacker the best choice overall is to have
only 10% attackers in the network, as otherwise the attacks
become too obvious and are detected by the outlier detection.
The overall defense mechanism is to use the 75th percentile
with c = 0.06 and c = 0.08 or to use the 50th percentile
with c = 0.08. It can be seen that there are 3 different Nash
Equilibria for this game model, this means that all of these
points lead to the best possible gain for the defender with
respect to the attack method applied.
We again use the secondary evaluation to determine how
irrational the players can act while still maintaining the same
optimal equilibrium proﬁles, as rationality can not be guar-
anteed. In Figure 4, we present the regular QRE. The y-axis
represents the probability for a strategy for a given λ. We
notice that in Game 3 (Figure 4(a)), the QRE converges to the
Nash equilibrium for λ → 0, implying that even if the attacker
is irrational, he will follow the Nash equilibrium with respect
to the prediction error. Regarding Game 4, the QRE converges
to the Nash equilibrium for λ ≈ 100 (Figure 4(b)), which is a
fast convergence although λ can become ∞. Using this metric
as the basis of the payoff function, an irrational attacker will
diverge from the Nash Equilibrium, but as it becomes more

C. AMP Data Set Analysis
Analysis for the outlier detection defense mechanism
with ﬁxed threshold. We evaluate the AMP data set looking
at both error metrics for different spatial outlier threshold
selections. Table VII describes the resulting strategy proﬁles
from following Game 1. We notice that for this data set, the
resulting strategy proﬁles are not nearly as homogeneous as
those for the King data set. Most of the resulting strategy
proﬁles consist of a mixed strategy, meaning that the different
strategies should be utilized with the given probability in order
to be as effective as possible. For example, given the spatial
outlier threshold of 1.25, the attacker has the most impact
while applying the deﬂation attack with only 10% malicious
nodes in the system with a probability of 0.55 and applying
the oscillation attack with 10% malicious nodes in the system
with a probability of 0.45. The countermeasures look similar,
applying spatial-temporal outlier detection and temporal out-
lier detection with probabilities of 0.93 and 0.07 respectively.
Overall, we can see that the spatial-temporal outlier detection
has highest probability of being applied. Interestingly, unlike
the King data set, the temporal outlier detection is often part of
the equilibrium, but only with low probability. The outcomes
for Game 2 are reﬂected in Table VIII. For this evaluation, only
the spatial-temporal outlier detection and the spatial outlier
detection are considered in the equilibriums.
Next, we investigate the optimal countermeasure with re-
spect to the different attacks. The spatial outlier detection
performs best against the three attacks. Assessing the different
thresholds, results show that a threshold value of 1.25 is the
best choice, a threshold value of 1.5 is second best, 1.75 third,
while 2 is last. Furthermore, we also evaluated the regular QRE
as we did for the King data set. Similar to the previous data set,
we note that with respect to the prediction error (Figure 3(a)),
players could be almost completely irrational while their best
strategies will still follow the Nash equilibrium, as it converges
for λ → 0. The relative error (Figure 3(b)) converges fast to
the Nash equilibrium for λ ≈ 500.
Analysis for spatial-temporal outlier detection with
adaptive spatial threshold. We evaluate the AMP data set
with spatial-temporal outlier detection and an adaptive thresh-
old selection for the spatial threshold. We initialize the spatial
threshold with 2. Table IX describes the resulting strategy pro-
ﬁles for the different payoffs and conﬁguration strategies for
Game 3 and Game 4 as deﬁned in Table I in Section V-B. We
again note that the different strategies are shown in Table III,
including the strategy c = 0, where control theory is not used.
We notice that the resulting Nash Equilibria are similar to the
Nash Equilibria for the KING data set. Based on this, we can
assume that independent of the data set we should apply in the
closed-loop feedback control a percentile of 75th percentile for
the prediction error. An attacker can disturb the network the
most while applying the inﬂation attack, but if he wants the
attacks to be undetected then deﬂation and oscillation are the
best attack choices. Furthermore, we again evaluate the regular
QRE and notice that with respect to Game 3 (Figure 5(a)) the
QRE converges to the Nash equilibrium for λ → 0, implying
that even if the attacker is irrational he follows the strategy
