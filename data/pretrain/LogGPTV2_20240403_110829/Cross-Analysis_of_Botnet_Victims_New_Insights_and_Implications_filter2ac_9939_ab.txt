other. Speciﬁcally, the IP address ranges of (77.* - 96.*), (109.* - 125.*), and
(186.* - 222.*) are highly infected by both types of botnets and their shared
regions (Common) are also distributed in the similar ranges.
To investigate how many infected networks are “really” shared between them,
we draw a diagram which represents the number of infected networks of each type
of botnet and networks that they share in common in Figure 1(b). There are

97,290 Common infected networks, 1,242,409 Type I EX networks, and 40,612
Type II EX networks.
Contrary to our expectation, the two types of botnets are distributed over
similar IP address ranges and there are many Common infected networks be-
tween them. However, this observation is only about the distribution over the
IP address space and it is very hard to ﬁnd semantic meanings such as their
physical locations from this result. For instance, even though we know a /24
subnet 111.111.111/24 is an infected network, we may not understand who are
using the subnet and where the subnet is located. More importantly, why is the
subnet more likely to be infected by certain type (or both types) of botnets? In
addition, the ranges are too broad to comprehend clearly. We show range (77.*
- 96.*) is highly infected, but that does not mean that all IP addresses in the
range are infected, we need more ﬁne-grained investigation. Besides that, we also
ﬁnd that there are some diﬀerences between them (i.e., Type I EX and II EX
infected networks are still signiﬁcant) and they also need to be understood, be-
cause they can show which ranges are more vulnerable to which type of botnet.
Only considering IP address ranges might not clearly show these diﬀerences.
Thus, we are motivated to consider more viewpoints that provide us some
understandable meanings with ﬁne-grained level semantic information. We have
selected four interesting viewpoints (we call them categories): (i) geographical
distribution of infected networks, which lets us identify more (or less) vulnerable
locations and their correlation with certain types of infections, (ii) IP address
population/density, which helps us understand relationships between the num-
ber of assigned IP address to the country and the number of infected networks
of the country, (iii) remote accessibility of networks, which shows us how open
(and thus possibly prone to infection) the networks are and whether there is
a correlation with certain infection types, and (iv) dynamism of IP addresses,
which tells us whether vulnerable networks use more dynamic IP addresses and
the correlation with infection type. In each category, we build a hypothesis based
on some intuition and then we perform a large scale passive or active measure-

ment to verify the hypothesis and gain some insights.
Insight 1. Interestingly, the two types of botnets are distributed in similar IP
address ranges despite of their diﬀerent infection types. In addition, the ranges
are continuous and it might imply that vulnerable networks are close to each
other. More ﬁne-grained analysis over the ranges might help us ﬁnd new results
and insights.
3.2 Geographical Distribution of Infected Networks
In our ﬁrst test, we have observed that two types of botnets seem to have similar
distributions over the IP address space. Thus, we could infer that the distribu-
tions of two diﬀerent types of botnets over geographical locations are similar to
each other. From this intuition, we make the following hypothesis.
Hypothesis 2. Type I and Type II infected networks are mainly distributed
over similar countries.
(a) Common
(b) Type I and I EX
(c) Type II and II EX
Fig. 2. Infected network distributions over the countries (x-axis for country code, y-axis
for percentage)
To verify this hypothesis, we investigate how each type of infected network is
distributed over countries. When we observe the overall distribution of each type
of botnet over the countries, we ﬁnd that all Common, Type I, Type I EX, Type
II, and Type II EX infected networks spread all over the world (with the exception
of Africa), but there are some concentrated areas. To analyze the result in detail,
we select the top 16 countries of each case and show their distributions in Figure
2. Results are sorted by the number of infected networks of the countries. Here,
X-axis represents the country code and Y-axis represents the percentage of each
infection type, e.g., if there are 100 Common infected networks overall and 14
infected networks are located in Turkey (its country code is TR2), the percentage
of Turkey is 14%.

In Figure 2(a), Common infected networks are mainly distributed in Asia
(e.g., Turkey, Korea, Russia, China, and India) with more than 35%. Figure
2(b) also presents that Type I and I EX infected networks are mainly distributed
over Asia. The distributions of Type I EX infected networks are quite similar
to that of Type I. The distributions of Type II and II EX infected networks are
shown in Figure 2(c). Here we still observe more than 30% as being located in
Asia.
From the observations, we ﬁnd two interesting things. First, the set of coun-
tries that are highly infected are not very diﬀerent for each type of botnet (i.e.,
if some countries are highly infected by Type I botnet, they are also likely to be
infected by Type II botnets). This implies that these countries are more prone
to be infected regardless of infection methods. Second, there are some countries
that are highly vulnerable to one type of botnet over the other. China is a good
example of this. China has a lot of Type I infected networks. However, it has
relatively small portions of Type II infected networks. We presume that most of
the networks in China are accessible from remote scanning botnets because Type
I botnets usually use network scanning techniques to ﬁnd new victims. We will
test this in section 3.4 and show whether our presumption is correct.
Insight 2. There are some countries which are prone to be infected by both
types of botnets. However, some other countries are more likely to be infected
by one type of botnet. Management policies of networks (e.g., network access
control) could aﬀect malware infection of the country.
3.3
IP Address Population
From the previous result, we know that the infected networks of each type of
botnet are concentrated mainly within several countries but the infection rates
between them are diﬀerent. Why is the infection rate between them diﬀerent?
Are there any possible answers or clues that might explain this? To ﬁnd out some
clues, we ﬁrst focus on the number of IP addresses assigned to each country.
IP addresses are not assigned evenly over networks or locations [22] [21]. In
terms of the IPv4 address space, there are some IP address ranges which have
not been assigned to users but registered only for other purposes, e.g., (224.*
- 239.*) is assigned for multicast addresses [22]. In addition, IP addresses have
been assigned diﬀerently over locations, e.g., more than 37% of IP addresses are
assigned to the United States, while Turkey only has less than 0.5% [21]. From
this fact, we can easily infer that countries that have more IP addresses could
have more chances to be infected by malware leading to Hypothesis 3. Here, we
will use the term of IP address population to represent the number of assigned
IP addresses and we deﬁne high IP address population country as the country
ranked in the top 30 in terms of the number of assigned IP addresses, and low

IP address population country as the country ranked below 30. All ranking in-
formation is based on [21].
Hypothesis 3. Countries with more IP addresses (high IP address popula-
tion countries) might contain more of both types of infected networks than low
IP address population countries.
To verify this hypothesis, we compare the number of infected networks of each
type of botnet with the number of IP addresses assigned to each country. The
comparison results are shown in Figure 3. We can see that the number of infected
networks of the Type I, II, I EX, II EX botnets are relatively proportional to
the IP address population (i.e., the more IP addresses a country has, the more
infected networks it contains). However, in the case of Common infected networks,
they are NOT proportional to IP address population. On the contrary, they are
mainly distributed over some low IP address population countries.
Fig. 3. Infected network distribution versus IP address population (x-axis for percent-
age of assigned IP addresses to a country, y-axis for percentage of infection of each
type of botnet in the country)
Intuitively, countries with more IP addresses have more chances to be in-
fected. Thus, we can easily accept the results of Type I, II, I EX, II EX. How-
ever, why do some high IP address population countries have less Common
infected networks while some low IP address population countries have more?
There may be several possible reasons for this. For example, the security edu-
cation/knowledge of people may play a role. People may open some vulnerable
services or click suspicious URLs without serious consideration, if they do not
have enough education/knowledge of security in some countries. Another possi-
ble reason is in regards to network management. If networks in a country are well
managed and protected very carefully, it is harder for malware to ﬁnd chances
to infect the networks. Thus, malware infection rate would not be proportional
to the number of IP addresses in the country.
10
Seungwon Shin, Raymond Lin, and Guofei Gu
The other interesting point is the percentage of infected networks over all
networks of the country (e.g., if a country has 100 networks and if 10 networks
among them are infected, the percentage of infected networks of the country is
10%). We have observed that high IP address population countries are likely to
have more infected networks. However, it does not mean that most (or a high
percentage) of networks in the country are infected. For example, even though
the United States has more number of Type II infected networks than other
countries (except Turkey), the infected networks may only cover small percentage
of all networks in the United States, because the country has around 38% of IP
addresses of the world. This can reveal some low IP address population countries
whose networks are more vulnerable (in terms of percentage) than other countries
and they could be ignored if only considering the absolute number of infected
networks.
To investigate the percentage of infected networks of each country, we have
used the data from the IP2Location.com report [21]. In the report, we ﬁnd that
2,505,141,392 IP addresses have been observed in the world. This may not cover
all observable IP addresses in the world. However we believe that it is close to
the real value. Their report also shows the percentage of IP addresses that each
country has out of all observed IP addresses.
We use this data to calculate the number of IP addresses assigned to each
country. Then, we calculate the number of /24 sub-networks of each country
by dividing the number of IP addresses assigned to the country by 256. At this
time, we make an assumption that “IP addresses are assigned to each country
with the minimum unit size of /24 subnet” to make our calculation easy. And we
calculate the ratio of infected networks in each country with it and the number
of infected /24 subnets. This scenario can be formalized as follows.
{ Θ = the number of all IP addresses in the world (i.e., 2,505,141,392)
{ ϵj = the percentage of assigned IP addresses to the country j
{ αj = the number of /24 subnets in country j
{ γi = the number of infected networks of type i botnet (e.g., γ1 represent the
number of infected networks of Type I botnet)
{ ηi = the percentage of infected networks of type i botnet in each country
Our goal is to calculate the value of η of each country, and this can be
obtained by the following formula (here j 2 f1, 2, ..., 240g, and 240 denotes the
number of countries which have observable IP addresses).
{ αj = (cid:2)
256
{ ηi = (cid:13)i
(cid:11)j
(cid:3) ϵj
(cid:3) 100, where i 2 f1, 2g
The distribution of the values of η over some selected countries are shown in
Figure 4. This result is quite diﬀerent from the previous result (in Figure 2). In
the case of Common (Figure 4(a)), some top ranked countries in Figure 2 show
quite low η values. Russia, Korea, China, and the United States are examples of
this case, however Turkey still represents high η value. From the results, we can
understand which countries are more vulnerable (i.e., high η value). Peru is an

interesting case. It has not been known as a country containing large number of
infected networks in our previous results. However large portions of its networks
in the country seem to be infected. Type I, I EX, II, and II EX also show similar
characteristics to the Common case and the results are shown in Figure 4 (b)
and (c). Based on these results, we may focus on some vulnerable countries
(e.g., Turkey and Peru) to study infection trends of botnets. They may be good
candidates for monitoring in order to comprehend the infection trends of botnets.
We try to reveal the reason why Turkey and Peru show high η values. From
our investigation, we ﬁnd a possible reason. It can be caused by geopolitical rea-
sons. Some previous work pointed out that Turkey has been suﬀered from large
cyber attacks generated by its neighbor countries such as Russia [24]. This ex-
