When I open my Command Prompt, the default path is `C:\Users\acer>`. I want to change the path to `C:\Python27`.

Here are the steps I followed:
1. I entered `cd..` twice to navigate up two directories.
2. Then, I entered `cd Python27` because my `Python27` folder is located in the `C:\` directory.

However, I received the following error message: "The system cannot find the path specified."

Can anyone help me?

**Response:**

There's no need for the multiple `cd ..` commands. You can directly change to the `C:\Python27` directory by entering:

```cmd
cd C:\Python27
```

This should work if the `Python27` folder is indeed located in the `C:\` directory. If you still encounter issues, please double-check that the folder name and path are correct.
