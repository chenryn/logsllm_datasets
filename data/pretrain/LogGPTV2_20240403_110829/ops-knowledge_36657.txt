User: When I open my Command Prompt,
the default path is C:\Users\acer>
so I want to change the path to C:\Python27
the method is as follows
i enter cd.. 2 times..
then I enter cd.. Python27 
as my Python27 folder located in C:\
however, I got this message "the system cannot find the path specified"
Can anyone help me?
Assistant: No need for cd .. mumbo jumbo, just go cd C:/Python27.
