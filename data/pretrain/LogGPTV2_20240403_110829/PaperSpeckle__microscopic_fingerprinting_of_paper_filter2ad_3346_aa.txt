ABSTRACT
Paper forgery is among the leading causes of corruption in
many developing regions [2].
In this paper, we introduce
PaperSpeckle, a robust system that leverages the natural
randomness property present in paper to generate a ﬁnger-
print for any piece of paper. Our goal in developing Pa-
perSpeckle is to build a low-cost paper based authentication
mechanism for applications in rural regions such as micro-
ﬁnance, healthcare, land ownership records, supply chain
services and education which heavily rely on paper based
records. Unlike prior paper ﬁngerprinting techniques that
have extracted ﬁngerprints based on the ﬁber structure of
paper, PaperSpeckle uses the texture speckle pattern, a ran-
dom bright/dark region formation at the microscopic level
when light falls on to the paper, to extract a unique ﬁnger-
print to identify paper. In PaperSpeckle, we show how to
extract a “repeatable” texture speckle pattern of a micro-
scopic region of a paper using low-cost machinery involving
paper, pen and a cheap microscope. Using extensive test-
ing on diﬀerent types of paper, we show that PaperSpeckle
can produce a robust repeatable ﬁngerprint even if paper is
damaged due to crumpling, printing or scribbling, soaking
in water or aging with time.

INTRODUCTION
Forgery of paper documents has been a major cause of
corruption in several countries around the world, especially
in developing regions. In these regions, most of the impor-
tant essential services such as ﬁnancial systems, healthcare,
governance, land records completely rely on paper as the
basic medium for storing critical information. In addition,
these services use paper as the primary means for establish-
ing identity and verifying the authenticity of information.
Hence, any form of mass paper forgery can negatively impact
the functioning of essential services and aﬀect large popula-
tions. For example, the recent stamp paper scam in India
unearthed an underground racket that produced fake stamp
papers to forge important land and governance records re-
sulting in a massive loss of over $10 billion dollars to the
exchequer [2].
In this paper, we introduce PaperSpeckle, a robust system
that leverages the natural randomness property present in
paper to generate a ﬁngerprint for any piece of paper.
The basic idea used in PaperSpeckle is the concept of tex-
ture speckles - when light falls onto an object, the scattered
light when projected to a screen produces bright and dark re-
gions formed due to paper’s texture and underlying physical
non-uniformities. Texture speckles are randomly distributed
making them a worthy candidate for generating ﬁngerprints.
The concept of speckles has been used in the area of laser
speckles to proﬁle objects [15]. Typically, extracting good
speckle patterns requires expensive equipment.
In Paper-
Speckle, we show a simple repeatable texture speckle pattern
extraction using paper, pen and a low cost microscope. We
capture the phenomena of multiple scattering of partially
coherent light (natural light) from the complex microscopic
structure (surface irregularities and particles) of the paper to
obtain the texture speckle pattern and use this information
to produce a ﬁngerprint of a speciﬁc region of the document.
Based on our experiences working in several rural develop-
ing regions, PaperSpeckle also addresses many of the prac-
tical constraints that occur in developing regions. Paper-
Speckle is low-cost, portable and compact. PaperSpeckle
can work with sub-$100 USB microscope connected to a sim-
ple mobile device. Paper based documents are very poorly
maintained in developing regions and can easily get dam-
aged due to a variety of factors: bad storage environments,
damage due to rain, crumpling and aging of paper. Based
on extensive stress testing, we show that PaperSpeckle is
robust and can withstand severe environmental conditions.
To illustrate the magnitude of robustness and damage resis-
99tance, PaperSpeckle can match ﬁngerprints even when the
conditions are non-ideal: (a) crumpling; (b) soaking the pa-
per in water; (c) generating the ﬁngerprint under diﬀerent
lighting conditions (diﬀerent microscopes) and (d) aging of
paper over time.
The rest of the sections are organized as follows: Sec-
tion 2 provides a brief description of speckles in general and
introduces the concept of paper speckle and how texture
speckle patterns can be extracted from a paper. Section
3 presents ﬁngerprint generation algorithm, that is used to
compare and distinguish speckle patterns, Section 4 presents
our implementation of the PaperSpeckle system on a desk-
top/laptop setting and also on a cellphone. Section 5 presents
a detailed evaluation of PaperSpeckle system and Section 6
discusses the application scenarios. In Section 7, we discuss
some of the issues regarding cloning or fabrication of paper
and some its limitations and we conclude with a look into
the future in Section 8.
1.1 Related Work
There have been a variety of paper ﬁngerprinting solu-
tions [8, 18, 16, 9, 30, 25, 7, 31, 3, 29] that have been pro-
posed to deal with this problem of paper forgery. One canon-
ical solution is to manufacture watermarked paper that uses
a special form of paper or ink material that is hard to repro-
duce [29, 8, 18, 16, 9, 30]. Another approach is to use diﬀer-
ent types of lithography techniques [10] to embed a unique
watermark in paper that would be hard to remove or dupli-
cate. The problem with both these approaches is that they
require expensive machinery or access to specialized paper
(which can be limited) which can constrain their applicabil-
ity to specialized applications such as currency notes, checks,
oﬃcial government paper records etc. In addition, the pa-
per/inks used in some of these techniques [29, 16, 9] are
specially prepared (using physical or chemical means). An-
other problem with these watermarking techniques is that
they embed the same watermark across a bulk collection of
documents (eg. currency notes, checks, oﬃcial paper); hence
watermarked documents of the same type are indistinguish-
able.
In many common applications (healthcare, ﬁnance)
which use paper-based records, it is essential to distinguish
individual paper documents from each other and prove its
authenticity. While standard bar-coding techniques [27] can
embed a unique code into each paper, such codes can easily
be reproduced and duplicated. PaperSpeckle diﬀers from
these standard techniques in that it uses the natural ran-
domness in paper and provides a low-cost distinguishable
ﬁngerprint for any piece of paper.
Smith et. al. introduced ﬁber ﬁngerprinting [7, 25] which
uses the ﬁber structure of the paper to provide unique sig-
nature of the paper. There have been patents on authenti-
cating paper documents based on their grain or ﬁber struc-
ture [19, 12]. The Print Signatures work by Zhu et. al. [31]
uses the randomness in character printing by a laser printer
to provide a unique signature of that region of paper. They
use a microscope to zoom into the minor ink splatters near a
character and extract the random pattern associated in the
ink splatter. Recently, Clarkson et. al. [4] used mid-range
scanners to model the 3D ﬁber structure of a paper and pro-
vide unique ﬁngerprints based on it. Cowburn et. al. [3, 1]
use laser microscopy to look into the complex ﬁber structure
of paper to produce a unique ﬁngerprint of the paper.
Our approach diﬀers from these related works in three
signiﬁcant ways. First, in PaperSpeckle we do not form
a 3D representation of the underlying paper structure nor
do we use laser microscopy. We capture the phenomena of
multiple scattering of partially coherent light (natural light)
from the complex microscopic structure (surface irregulari-
ties and particles) of the paper region using a microscope to
obtain the texture speckle pattern and use this information
to produce a unique ﬁngerprint of a region of the document.
The physical property that we use to ﬁngerprint the paper
is very diﬀerent from existing solutions. The scale at which
the speckle pattern is extracted is at a microscopic level: a
pixel in a speckle pattern is about 1-2 microns. To give a
sense of the scale, the size of a red blood cell in the human
body is about 8 microns.
Second, the technique used in ﬁngerprint generation is
diﬀerent from existing solutions and the ﬁngerprint is much
more compact. In addition to this, we also provide a detailed
evaluation with respect to adverse environmental conditions
and show that our system is robust in real world settings.
Not only our system works without any modiﬁcation to the
paper document, it can be used with any specialized ink
(such as the Uniball 207 Gel ink) to provide robust security
in various scenarios. Texture speckle patterns can be ex-
tracted even when specialized ink or paper is used. We do
not generate secure sketch of the ﬁngerprint, since in devel-
oping regions authentication of a piece of paper is performed
in an oﬄine manner with an untrusted device. Also, the ad-
versary might have access to the original document, which
makes the secure sketch non-useful.
Third, unlike bulky equipment like scanners and laser sur-
face authentication devices, we use a portable, handheld mi-
croscope to obtain the speckle pattern, that can be used in a
widespread fashion in developing regions. Our system works
both on a desktop/laptop and a cellphone. Cellphone is
widely prevalent in the developing regions across the world
and since our system also works on a cellphone, it can be
readily used in a variety of settings.
Optical marks [17] are used to authenticate paper doc-
uments using latent images in diﬀerent layers of a paper
document. In our application, we do not manufacture pa-
per documents, nor do we modify the document in any way.
Due to the eﬀect of multiple scattering of light through the
structure of the paper, texture speckle pattern arises; and
the ﬁngerprint generated from this texture speckle pattern is
used to authenticate that piece of paper.
2. SPECKLES
In this section we provide a brief background on laser
speckles and then introduce paper speckles which are based
on partially coherent light source (light of ﬁnite bandwidth).
We discuss its advantages over laser speckles, describe the
device setup and ﬁnally show how repeatable paper speckle
patterns can be extracted using a microscope (with inbuilt
LED) and a piece of paper.
2.1 Laser Speckles
When light falls onto an object and the scattered light is
projected onto a screen, the screen is speckled with bright
and dark regions which represents a speckle pattern [11].
A Speckle pattern is a random intensity pattern produced
by the mutual interference of coherent or partially coherent
wavefronts that are subject to phase diﬀerences or intensity
ﬂuctuations. At the screen these rays have a diﬀerent op-

speckle pattern represents how partially coherent light from
the LED gets scattered through the rough surface and the
underlying microscopic structures of the region of the paper
focused on.
These texture speckle patterns generated from a simple
microscope with an inbuilt LED light source makes an ex-
cellent choice for a paper ﬁngerprint due to a variety of fac-
tors. First, as shown in prior work on laser speckles [3],
speckle patterns generated from lasers are tamperproof even
if paper is soaked in water, crumpled, aﬀected by aging etc.
- the chances that the microscopic structure gets aﬀected
are small. As we show in this paper, the ﬁngerprint gen-
erated from texture speckle patterns from partially coher-
ent light source is suﬃcient to achieve the same objectives.
Second, generating these texture speckle patterns is cheap
(when compared to laser speckles), and is easy to use which
make them a great choice for developing regions. Third, ex-
tracting just the ﬁber structure of the paper at a relative
macroscopic level with a small zoom might be susceptible
to cloning by the adversary. While the ﬁeld of view of our
microscopes are about 0.5mm (or much smaller based on the
magniﬁcation) in diameter, ﬁber ﬁngerprinting uses a much
larger region of about 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm.
The light from the LED is focused on the paper and the
scattered light from the paper is captured by the imaging
system, which consists of an optical microscope arrange-
ment. The microscope has two controls, one is the magni-
ﬁcation and another is the focus. The images are captured
using a ﬁxed magniﬁcation of 200x, but the focus is varied
to provide a more crisp image, with minimal blur.
The texture speckle pattern is dependent on the proper-
ties of the imaging system: the type of incident light source,
the distance between the light source and the object, the
