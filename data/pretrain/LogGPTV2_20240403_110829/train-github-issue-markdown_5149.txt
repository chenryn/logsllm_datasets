find_first would be a performance enhancement. The current alternative would
be something like:
argmax (some boolean function...)
which requires a lot of extra work if all you want is the index of the first
occurance.
This is frequently wanted for 1-d arrays, where it's meaning is unambiguous. I
think semantics for n-d (n > 1) arrays is up for discussion.
