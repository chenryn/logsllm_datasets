this is standart superset time series bar chart:

query:
    SELECT DATE(order_date, -strftime('%d', order_date) || ' days', '+1 day') AS __timestamp,
           deal_size AS deal_size,
           sum(sales) AS "(Sales)"
    FROM "Vehicle Sales"
    JOIN
      (SELECT deal_size AS deal_size__,
              sum(sales) AS mme_inner__
       FROM "Vehicle Sales"
       WHERE order_date >= '2003-01-01 00:00:00.000000'
         AND order_date = '2003-01-01 00:00:00.000000'
      AND order_date = '2003-01-01 00:00:00.000000'
      AND order_date = '2003-01-01 00:00:00.000000'
         AND order_date < '2005-06-01 00:00:00.000000'
       GROUP BY deal_size
       ORDER BY mme_inner__ DESC
       LIMIT 100
       OFFSET 0) AS anon_1 ON deal_size = deal_size__
This JOIN increases the data loading time  
Old superset works fine
