### Review Features

We have defined several review features that package registries can implement to proactively secure user access and detect vulnerable or malicious packages. Unfortunately, none of these features are currently supported. Below is a detailed explanation of each feature:

1. **Metadata Analysis**:
   - **Description**: This involves analyzing the metadata of a given package, which includes dependency analysis, author information, update history, and additional packaged components.
   - **Purpose**: To identify potential security risks by examining the package's dependencies, author, and update history.

2. **Static Analysis**:
   - **Description**: This involves performing linting for stylistic and logical code analysis.
   - **Purpose**: To detect vulnerable or malicious code, as well as to scan binary components with anti-virus (AV) solutions.

3. **Dynamic Analysis**:
   - **Description**: This involves analyzing the behavior of a package by dynamically executing it and monitoring suspicious behaviors, such as network connections and file accesses.
   - **Purpose**: To identify runtime vulnerabilities and malicious activities that may not be apparent from static analysis alone.

### Remediation Features

Once security teams have identified abnormal signals that warrant further investigation, they carry out the following remediation actions:

1. **Removal**:
   - **Basic Operations**: 
     - Remove the affected package.
     - Disable the publisherâ€™s account.
   - **Proactive Operations**: 
     - Remove the package from all installed instances.
   - **Purpose**: To prevent further damage and ensure that the malicious package is no longer available for installation.

2. **Notification**:
   - **Mechanism**: RMs notify the public about the offending package through various channels.
   - **Purpose**: To inform users and developers about the security issue and provide guidance on how to mitigate the risk.

By implementing these review and remediation features, package registries can significantly enhance the security and integrity of their ecosystems.
