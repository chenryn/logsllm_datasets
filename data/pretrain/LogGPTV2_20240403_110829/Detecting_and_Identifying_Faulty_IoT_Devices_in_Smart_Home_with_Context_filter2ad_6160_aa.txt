## Abstract
A fast and reliable method to detect faulty Internet of Things (IoT) devices is essential in IoT environments. This paper introduces DICE, an automatic method for detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices using context extraction. The system operates in two phases: a precomputation phase and a real-time phase. During the precomputation phase, DICE computes sensor correlations and transition probabilities between sensor states. In the real-time phase, it detects and identifies faults by analyzing violations of these correlations and transitions. We demonstrate that DICE accurately and promptly identifies faulty devices through evaluations on various fault types and datasets.

## 1. Introduction
The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted various aspects of human life, including smart homes and cities. These IoT applications, which use sensors and actuators, provide convenient services but are prone to frequent device failures due to their limited computational capabilities and exposure to harsh environments. Sensor faults can have severe consequences, extending from the cyber to the physical domain. For example, a faulty light sensor in a smart home could lead to privacy breaches.

Recent studies have proposed solutions for detecting faulty sensors in IoT environments by leveraging correlations between activities and sensors or between actuators and sensors. However, these methods often require user intervention, lack generality, and are computationally expensive. Additionally, they may take too long to detect faults, leading to serious issues.

In this paper, we propose DICE, an automatic method for detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices based on context extraction. Our approach does not require user activity recognition, works for various device and fault types, and is faster than existing methods. DICE consists of two phases: a precomputation phase where sensor correlations and state transition probabilities are computed, and a real-time phase where correlation and transition violations are detected and faulty devices are identified.

To evaluate our system, we implemented a smart home testbed with various sensors and actuators and tested it on both internal and publicly available datasets. Our results show that DICE achieves an average precision of 94.9% and recall of 92.5%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of IoT environments.

**Main Contributions:**
- **Novel Design:** A new method for detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices.
- **Usability:** No user intervention required; context is automatically extracted.
- **Generality:** Works for binary and numeric values, and handles various fault types.
- **Feasibility:** Requires minimal computation time.
- **Promptness:** Detects and identifies faults quickly, with an average detection time of 3 minutes and identification time of 28 minutes.

## 2. Related Work
Sensor failure detection and identification have been extensively studied, with three main approaches: network-level, homogeneous, and heterogeneous.

### 2.1 Network-Level Approach
Network-level solutions, such as those in [12]–[16], monitor packet flow and use distributed sensor node monitoring to detect anomalies. These methods are effective for fail-stop faults but struggle with non-fail-stop faults.

### 2.2 Homogeneous Approach
Homogeneous approaches, like [17]–[24], deploy multiple sensors of the same type to detect anomalies. While effective, these methods increase deployment costs and rely on threshold-based decisions, which can be challenging to optimize.

### 2.3 Heterogeneous Approach
Heterogeneous approaches, such as SMART [5], FailureSense [7], IDEA [6], CLEAN [8], and 6thSense [9], combine different sensor types to detect failures. However, these methods often require user intervention, lack generality, and are computationally expensive. Table I summarizes the usability, generality, feasibility, and promptness of these methods compared to DICE.

## 3. DICE: Detection & Identification with Context Extraction

### 3.1 Overview
DICE is designed for typical smart homes with diverse IoT devices, a home gateway, and a cloud server. The system operates in two phases: precomputation and real-time.

#### 3.1.1 Precomputation Phase
During the precomputation phase, DICE computes:
- **Correlation Extraction:** Correlations among sensors.
- **Transition Extraction:** Transition probabilities between sensor states.

#### 3.1.2 Real-Time Phase
In the real-time phase, DICE:
- **Detects Correlation Violations:** Analyzes sensor data to find deviations from expected correlations.
- **Detects Transition Violations:** Monitors state sequences to identify abnormal transitions.
- **Identifies Faulty Devices:** Compares problematic contexts with probable ones to pinpoint the faulty device.

## 4. Evaluation
We evaluated DICE on a smart home testbed with various sensors and actuators, using both internal and public datasets. The results show that DICE achieves high precision and recall, confirming its effectiveness in detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices.

## 5. Discussion
DICE addresses the limitations of existing methods by providing a user-friendly, general, feasible, and prompt solution for detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices. Future work will focus on further optimizing the system and expanding its application to other IoT environments.

## 6. Conclusion
DICE is a novel and effective method for detecting and identifying faulty IoT devices in smart homes. By leveraging context extraction, DICE enhances the reliability of IoT environments without requiring user intervention. Our evaluation demonstrates that DICE outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed, making it a valuable tool for maintaining the integrity of smart home systems.
