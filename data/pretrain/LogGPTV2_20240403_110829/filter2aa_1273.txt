#### Motivation
Despite the extensive literature and discussions on the dangers of using OPEN and WEP-based WiFi networks, the level of awareness about WiFi vulnerabilities remains low. A recent study by AirTight Networks in April 2009 found that:
- 56% of clients were probing for one or more SSIDs.
- 13% of clients were probing for OPEN ad hoc networks.

Most users are vulnerable, yet they are often unaware of the risks.

#### Introducing Wi-Fish Finder
Wi-Fish Finder is a tool designed to:
1. Discover active WiFi clients.
2. Identify the networks they are probing for.
3. Determine the security settings of the probed networks.

While steps 1 and 2 have been implemented before, the unique feature of Wi-Fish Finder is step 3. Even clients that only connect to WPA and WPA2 networks can be vulnerable.

#### Network Name Leakage
WiFi-enabled roaming clients often leak the names of networks they have connected to in the past. This can include OPEN or WEP networks, making these clients susceptible to honeypot-style attacks.

#### Determining Security Settings
A WiFi-enabled laptop retains a memory of various WiFi networks it has connected to. If the security settings of each probed SSID can be determined, a matching honeypot can be created instantly.

#### Key Points
- If the probed SSID list contains at least one OPEN network, a simple OPEN honeypot will suffice.
- If the list includes at least one WEP network, Caffe Latte can be used.
- If the list contains only WPA-PSK networks, a honeypot attack is still possible (see next slide).
- If the list contains only WPA2 networks, a honeypot attack is still possible in some cases (see next slide).

#### Latest Advancements in Dictionary Attack Tools
To perform a dictionary attack, only the first two frames of the 4-way EAPOL handshake are required. Thanks to Thomas D’Otreppe's latest aircrack-ng, not all four handshake frames are necessary. This was disclosed at UNAM, Mexico City, on November 27-28, 2008.

#### WPA/WPA2-PSK Client Targeting: Attack Choreography
1. **Initial Connection**: The client and AP establish a connection.
2. **Dictionary Attack**: The attacker collects the first two frames of the 4-way handshake by setting up a fake access point and luring the client to connect. The passphrase is then retrieved using the latest aircrack-ng tool.
3. **Final Connection**: The AP is reconfigured with the correct passphrase, allowing the client to complete the 4-way handshake and connect to the attacker’s machine.

#### Conclusion
Despite the measures taken to secure WiFi infrastructure, WiFi-enabled devices still require adequate security. An infected laptop can pose a serious threat to an organization, as highlighted by SANS in their recent report: [Newest WLAN Hacks Come From Afar](http://darkreading.com/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=2Y42ER3MPBL2OQSNDLOSKHSCJUNN2JVN?articleID=217100332).

Wi-Fish Finder is a valuable tool for reflecting the security posture of WiFi-enabled client devices and assessing their risk levels.

#### Food for Thought
- Can the PNL of a client that does not broadcast its SSID in probes be guessed?
- Hint: Consider a dictionary attack!
