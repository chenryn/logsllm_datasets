As for now, there is no way to disable code splitting feature with some
option.
Build & rebuild time is more with code splitting, so, it is useful from
developer experience point of view to disable it in development mode.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-remove-webpack could handle some of
cases, excluding modern `import()` signature.
