Currently, there is no direct option to disable the code splitting feature. Code splitting increases both the build and rebuild times, which can negatively impact the developer experience. Therefore, it would be beneficial to have the ability to disable code splitting in development mode.

One potential solution is to use the `babel-plugin-remove-webpack` package, which can handle some cases. However, it does not support the modern `import()` syntax.

For more information, you can refer to the [npm package documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-remove-webpack).
