3.3 Third Iteration - Visual Elements and
Lay-User Feedback
The third iteration focused on the visual appeal and the understand-
ability of the awareness-raising material. We added visual elements
to the material and incorporated qualitative feedback of lay-users
on both, the textual descriptions and the visual elements. To this
end, we met with several lay-users from our university (i.e. secre-
taries, designers, and project coordinators) in our lab, gave them the
awareness-raising material and asked them to point out any aspect
they had problems understanding or found visually unappealing.
With respect to the textual descriptions, only minor changes (e.g.
wording) were necessary. For the visual design, we added dedicated
icons to signify the dierent types of content: a red skull signifying
the attack description, a blue shield signifying the defence descrip-
tion, and a blue speech bubble with an "i" on it to signify further
hints. Also, images illustrating each of the attacks were added to
the attack’s descriptions. Figure 1 depicts these visual elements.
4 USER STUDY METHODOLOGY
In their review of literature on information security awareness,
Haeussinger and Kranz [14] recommend to evaluate awareness-
raising materials in real work environments. Additionally, small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seem to be a particularly
interesting target for attackers: 61% of attacks in 2017 occurred
in organisations with under 1000 employees [33]. Therefore, we
decided to conduct our study with 90 lay-users employed in three
dierent SMEs in their real work environments (30 participants in
each SME). The main goal of this study is to evaluate the eective-
ness of the awareness-raising material in conveying the knowledge
regarding the attacks and defences to the users. In addition, cor-
rectly assessing the security of passwords is a crucial aspect of
password management. Even when relying on password managers,
users in the SME context most often have to choose some passwords
themselves, in particular the master password for their password
manager [37], but also the password for unlocking their worksta-
tion and other uses [16]. Therefore, we also assessed the material’s
eect on the participants’ respective skill. Additionally, we wanted
736
to gain qualitative feedback from the users with respect to the use-
fulness of the awareness-raising material and the images added
in the third iteration of its development. The study methodology
conforms to all requirements of our university’s ethics commission.
In the following, we explain in detail the hypotheses, procedure,
and questionnaires of our study as well as some important aspects
of the analysis methodology.
4.1 Hypotheses
To evaluate the eectiveness of the awareness-raising material, it
is important to test whether the contained knowledge is action-
able, i.e. the participants know how to behave in a situation of
attack. To that end, typically pre-treatment and post-treatment
questionnaires with the same items are used to measure the dier-
ence in performance of the participants (where the treatment is the
awareness-raising material). Our respective hypothesis is:
H1a:
The awareness-raising material signicantly increases the
users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-
related behaviour in dierent scenarios known to the
participant before reading through the material.
However, a frequent criticism of such evaluations is that the pre-
treatment questionnaire primes the participants with respect to
the treatment. It remains therefore unknown if an improvement
which is measured after the participants have read through the
material can be transferred to new scenarios. Therefore, we decided
to investigate not only whether participants improve their ability
to discern secure from insecure password-related behaviour in
scenarios known from the pre-treatment questionnaire, but to also
include new scenarios to the post-treatment questionnaire. Our
corresponding hypothesis is:
H1b:
The awareness-raising material signicantly increases the
users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-
related behaviour in dierent scenarios unknown to the
participant before reading through the material.
The skill of correctly assessing the security of passwords is essential
to the assessment of behaviour related to password security in the
face of guessing attacks, even when relying on technologies such
as password managers. Our respective hypothesis is:
H2a:
The awareness-raising material signicantly increases the
users’ ability to correctly assess the security of passwords.
The above hypotheses H1a, H1b, and H2a pertain to the eect of
the awareness-raising material observed directly after the treat-
ment. In addition to this direct eect, it is important that the ef-
fect of the awareness-raising material does not decline even after
longer periods of time, since companies will usually distribute
awareness-raising material not continuously, but rather in intervals
(e.g. annually, biannually, or quarterly). Therefore, we decided to
also investigate the eects of the awareness raising material in a
retention after six months. The respective hypotheses are
H1c:
The awareness-raising material signicantly increases the
users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-
related behaviour in dierent scenarios known to the
participant before reading through the material even six
months after reading it.

4.2 Procedure
To investigate the hypotheses outlined in the last section, we em-
ployed a study procedure consisting of four phases: (1) a pre-treatment
questionnaire measuring the baseline for the hypotheses in our par-
ticipant sample; (2) the treatment using the developed awareness-
raising material, (3) a post-treatment questionnaire measuring the
eect of the treatment with respect to the aforementioned hypothe-
ses and gathering the qualitative feedback as well as collecting basic
demographics data, and (4) a retention questionnaire measuring the
eect of the treatment with respect to the aforementioned hypothe-
ses after six months. Figure 2 depicts an overview of these phases
in the context of the hypotheses presented in the last section.
The evaluation was conducted with employees at three SMEs in
Germany. Consequently, we conducted the user study in German,
i.e. the awareness-raising material and the questionnaires were
given to the participants in German. The participants were explic-
itly selected as lay-users with respect to information security and
from a wide range of professions by a contact person in each of the
three organisations. The contact person also sent out and collected
the questionnaires. Using a contact person as intermediary in each
organisation ensured that participants remained anonymous, de-
spite answering the questionnaires in their real work environment.
Participants received the questionnaires and the awareness-raising
material as PDF-les via email one after the other as per the four
phases outlined before (i.e. one PDF-le per phase). The PDF-le in
the st phase comprised the pre-treatment questionnaire with the
respective instructions (overall 20 pages). The PDF-le in the sec-
ond phase comprised only the awareness-raising material (overall
110 pages). The PDF-le in the third phase comprised the post-
treatment questionnaire with the respective instructions (overall
42 pages). The PDF-le in the fourth phase comprised the retention
questionnaire and the respective instructions (overall 30 pages).
Only upon sending the completed pre-treatment questionnaire, the
participant received the awareness-raising material with the instruc-
tion to take their time to read it. Once the participants conrmed
that they had read the awareness-raising material, they received the
post-treatment questionnaire. After all participants in an organisa-
tion had completed the post-treatment questionnaires, the contact
person sent the lled-out questionnaires to the authors. Then, after
six months the contact person received the retention questionnaires
for all participants and again sent the lled ones back to us. Only
one of the SMEs agreed to participate in the retention session. This
is further discussed in section 7.
4.3 Questionnaires
In this section, we present the items used in our evaluation. All
items were developed in an iterative process using feedback from
psychologists and from two rounds of pre-tests with lay-users.
For H1a d 22 scenarios were developed to evaluate the par-
ticipants’ ability to correctly assess specic password-related be-
haviour as secure or insecure. For each of the 11 attacks described
in section 3, two scenarios were developed: one representing secure
behaviour and one representing insecure behaviour. The scenarios
were developed with additional feedback from information security
consultants, in order to increase the real world relevancy of the sce-
narios for SME employees. The scenarios are closely aligned with
the attacks and defences described in the awareness-raising mate-
rial. Thereby, our goal was to create challenges for the participants
that did not simply test the declarative knowledge. Instead, we
created scenarios that required the participant to judge password-
related behaviour aligned to the attacks and defences as secure
737

or insecure in the same way they would have to judge their own
behaviour when applying the newly gained knowledge in dierent
situations of their daily lives. An overview of all 22 scenarios can
be found in table 2 in the appendix at the end of this paper. In
the questionnaires, each scenario was accompanied by two ques-
tions: (1) a binary question where the participants had to indicate
whether they believed the scenario represents secure or insecure
behaviour and (2) an open text question oering the participants
the possibility to justify their decision.
To allow testing H1a d using the developed scenarios, the pre-
treatment questionnaire comprised only 11 of the 22 scenarios cho-
sen at random for each participant (one for each of the attacks, bal-
anced in terms of secure/insecure behaviour). The post-treatment
questionnaire comprised all 22 scenarios. This allowed us to assess
not only the performance in scenarios known before the treatment,
but also the participants’ ability to transfer the gained knowledge
to new scenarios. The retention questionnaire also included all
22 scenarios. The order of the scenarios was randomised for each
participant in all questionnaires.
For H2a,b, the participants had to rate 12 passwords according to
their security on a 5-point Likert scale (see Figure 3 on the next page
for the full list). Only the two ends of the scale were labelled as very
insecure and very secure. Of the 12 passwords, seven were chosen
to be guessable within seconds using Hashcat with the best64 and
generated2 rule sets in conjunction with Mark Burnett’s wordlist
[8] which he specically released for academic research (in the
following "insecure passwords"). The remaining 5 passwords were
chosen using a German diceware list (about 80’000 entries, created
from the German Mozilla Firefox dictionary) to be not guessable
with reasonable eort (in the following "secure passwords"). All 12
passwords were included in all three questionnaires.
With respect to the qualitative feedback, we asked free text
questions regarding four aspects: (1) the relevancy of the included
information (item: "Was the content of the awareness-raising ma-
terial relevant for you?"); (2) additional information the partici-
pants would have hoped for (item: "Which additional information
would you have hoped for in the awareness-raising material?");
(3) helpfulness of the images for understanding the content of the
awareness-raising material (item: "Were the images helpful in un-
derstanding the content of the awareness-raising-material? How
could they be improved?"); and (4) whether the awareness-raising
material will have an eect on how the participants manage their
passwords and, if so, what eect it is (item: "Will the content of
the awareness-raising material inuence the way you currently
manage your passwords?"). As demographics, we only collected the
participants’ gender and age. The qualitative questions inquiring
the participants’ opinion on the awareness-raising material’s con-
tent and visual elements (as well as the demographics questions)
were only present in the post-treatment questionnaire.
4.4 Analysis
Due to the fact, that only employees from one SME lled the re-
tention questionnaires, the size of the sample is also reduced to a
third. Therefore, we rst present the analysis of the results of the
pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires (i.e. H1a,b and
H2a) in section 5. Thereafter, we present the results of the retention
questionnaires (i.e. H1c,d and H2b) in section section 6.
For the analyses pertaining to the assessment of behaviour in
scenarios related to password security, the participants responses
were aggregated into ratios of correct responses for each scenario.
Thereby, it is important to note that H1a and H1c are thus based
on a within-subject design: all responses pertaining to scenarios
not seen by the respective participant in the pre-treatment ques-
tionnaire are excluded from the post-treatment questionnaire data
in this analysis. Consequently, paired hypothesis tests are used
in this case. In contrast, the analyses of H1b and H1d are based
on a between-subjects design: the responses in the post-treatment
questionnaire stem solely from participants that have not seen
the respective scenarios in the pre-treatment questionnaire. Con-
sequently, independent sample hypothesis tests are used in this
case. Since our data was not normally distributed we used the non-
parametric Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples and the
non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for independent samples.
We used Bonferroni-Holm-corrected  -levels where appropriate.
Eect sizes are interpreted according to [9] as small (r   0.10),
medium (r   0.30) or large (r   0.50).
5 RESULTS – PRE-TREATMENT AND
POST-TREATMENT QUESTIONNAIRES
In this section, we present the results of our analysis of the data
pertaining to the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires.
Overall 90 employees from three SMEs in Germany lled the pre-
treatment and post-treatment questionnaires. Six participants had
to be excluded from the analysis. Their answers to the free text
questions showed detailed knowledge of information security (e.g.
dierent encryption algorithms) and therefore raised doubts as
to whether they would qualify as lay-users. Of the remaining 84
participants, 56 were male, 27 were female, and one participant
chose to not answer this question. The participants’ age ranged
from 19 years to 43 years (M: 30.0 years; SD: 5.4 years).
5.1 Assessment of Scenarios
For most scenarios, the participating employees assessed the de-
scribed behaviour correctly in the pre-treatment questionnaire.
Two scenarios (3 and 13) stood out due to large numbers of in-
correct answers. A large portion of the free text answers to these
two scenarios indicated that specic formulations in the scenarios
caused participating employees to misinterpret them. This indicates
methodological problems with the scenarios (as opposed to prob-
lems with the content of the awareness-raising material), which
were not uncovered in the pre-tests. For scenario 3, the majority of
participants perceived a locked drawer at home not as secure stor-
age. For scenario 13, the majority of participants perceived that a
dog’s birthday would not be a secret, despite the scenario explicitly
stating this as fact. Thus, we excluded these two scenarios from the
analysis and only the responses to the remaining 20 scenarios were
considered. An overview of the results is depicted in Figure 3a.
5.1.1 Analysis of H1a. The awareness-raising material leads to
an overall increase in correctly assessed scenarios from 88.2% before
the treatment to 93.3% afterwards, when considering the responses
with respect to the scenarios participants saw before and after the
