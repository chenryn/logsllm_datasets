### Interaction and Communication

#### 3.3 Third Iteration - Visual Elements and Lay-User Feedback

The third iteration focused on enhancing the visual appeal and understandability of the awareness-raising material. We incorporated visual elements and gathered qualitative feedback from lay-users regarding both the textual descriptions and the visual design. To achieve this, we met with several lay-users from our university (e.g., secretaries, designers, and project coordinators) in our lab. We provided them with the awareness-raising material and asked them to identify any aspects they found difficult to understand or visually unappealing.

For the textual descriptions, only minor changes (e.g., wording) were necessary. For the visual design, we introduced dedicated icons to signify different types of content: a red skull for attack descriptions, a blue shield for defense descriptions, and a blue speech bubble with an "i" to indicate additional hints. Additionally, we added images illustrating each type of attack to the attack descriptions. Figure 1 illustrates these visual elements.

### 4. User Study Methodology

In their review of literature on information security awareness, Haeussinger and Kranz [14] recommend evaluating awareness-raising materials in real work environments. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are particularly vulnerable, with 61% of attacks in 2017 occurring in organizations with fewer than 1,000 employees [33]. Therefore, we conducted our study with 90 lay-users employed in three different SMEs, with 30 participants in each SME. The primary goal was to assess the effectiveness of the awareness-raising material in conveying knowledge about attacks and defenses. Additionally, we evaluated the material's impact on participants' ability to correctly assess the security of passwords, a crucial aspect of password management. Even when using password managers, users often need to choose some passwords themselves, such as the master password for the manager and the password for unlocking their workstation [37, 16].

We also sought qualitative feedback from users regarding the usefulness of the awareness-raising material and the images added in the third iteration. The study methodology adhered to all requirements of our university’s ethics commission.

#### 4.1 Hypotheses

To evaluate the effectiveness of the awareness-raising material, it is essential to test whether the contained knowledge is actionable, i.e., whether participants know how to behave in an attack situation. Typically, pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires with the same items are used to measure the difference in performance. Our hypotheses are:

- **H1a:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-related behavior in different scenarios known to the participant before reading through the material.
- **H1b:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-related behavior in different scenarios unknown to the participant before reading through the material.
- **H2a:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to correctly assess the security of passwords.

These hypotheses (H1a, H1b, and H2a) pertain to the immediate effect of the awareness-raising material. To ensure that the effect does not decline over time, we also investigated the retention of knowledge after six months. The respective hypotheses are:

- **H1c:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-related behavior in different scenarios known to the participant before reading through the material, even six months after reading it.
- **H1d:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to discern secure from insecure password-related behavior in different scenarios unknown to the participant before reading through the material, even six months after reading it.
- **H2b:** The awareness-raising material significantly increases the users’ ability to correctly assess the security of passwords even six months after reading it.

**Figure 2: Overview of the Study Design**
- **Pre-Treatment Questionnaire:** Assessing behavior in 11 scenarios (randomly selected and ordered).
- **Treatment:** Providing the awareness-raising material.
- **Post-Treatment Questionnaire:** Assessing behavior in 22 scenarios (11 known and 11 new, randomly ordered).
- **Retention Questionnaire (after six months):** Assessing behavior in 22 scenarios (11 known and 11 new, randomly ordered).

#### 4.2 Procedure

To investigate the hypotheses, we employed a four-phase study procedure:
1. **Pre-Treatment Questionnaire:** Measuring the baseline for the hypotheses in our participant sample.
2. **Treatment:** Using the developed awareness-raising material.
3. **Post-Treatment Questionnaire:** Measuring the effect of the treatment and gathering qualitative feedback.
4. **Retention Questionnaire:** Measuring the effect of the treatment after six months.

The evaluation was conducted with employees at three SMEs in Germany. The study was conducted in German, and the participants were selected as lay-users with respect to information security. A contact person in each organization distributed and collected the questionnaires, ensuring participant anonymity. Participants received the questionnaires and the awareness-raising material as PDF files via email. Only one SME agreed to participate in the retention session, which is further discussed in section 7.

#### 4.3 Questionnaires

The items in the questionnaires were developed iteratively with feedback from psychologists and two rounds of pre-tests with lay-users. For H1a–d, 22 scenarios were developed to evaluate participants’ ability to assess specific password-related behavior as secure or insecure. Each scenario included a binary question and an open text question for justification.

- **Pre-Treatment Questionnaire:** 11 out of 22 scenarios (randomly selected and ordered).
- **Post-Treatment Questionnaire:** All 22 scenarios (randomly ordered).
- **Retention Questionnaire:** All 22 scenarios (randomly ordered).

For H2a,b, participants rated 12 passwords on a 5-point Likert scale. Seven passwords were chosen to be guessable within seconds using Hashcat, while the remaining five were chosen to be non-guessable with reasonable effort.

Qualitative feedback questions included:
1. Relevance of the included information.
2. Additional information desired.
3. Helpfulness of the images.
4. Impact on password management.

#### 4.4 Analysis

Due to the reduced sample size for the retention questionnaires, we first analyzed the results of the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires (H1a,b and H2a) and then the retention questionnaires (H1c,d and H2b). For the analysis of behavior assessment in scenarios, participants' responses were aggregated into ratios of correct responses. Paired hypothesis tests were used for H1a and H1c, while independent sample hypothesis tests were used for H1b and H1d. Non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank and rank sum tests were used, and Bonferroni-Holm-corrected α-levels were applied where appropriate.

### 5. Results – Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment Questionnaires

Overall, 90 employees from three SMEs in Germany completed the pre-treatment and post-treatment questionnaires. Six participants were excluded due to detailed knowledge of information security, leaving 84 participants (56 male, 27 female, 1 unspecified; age range: 19-43 years, mean: 30.0 years, SD: 5.4 years).

#### 5.1 Assessment of Scenarios

Most participants assessed the described behavior correctly in the pre-treatment questionnaire. Two scenarios (3 and 13) had large numbers of incorrect answers due to misinterpretations. These scenarios were excluded from the analysis. The overall increase in correctly assessed scenarios from 88.2% before the treatment to 93.3% afterwards indicates a positive effect of the awareness-raising material.
