both discounts combined amounted to an average of $4.49 per
magnetic stripe account and $1.33 for CNP, corresponding
to 25% and 9% of the total listing prices, respectively. We
provide detailed discount information to highlight a challenge
for researchers monitoring carder shops by scraping their
websites; advertised discounts require scraping the entire in-
ventory regularly in order to make accurate revenue estimates.
Furthermore, the quantity of loyalty discounts and refunded
purchases may not be visible externally at all. It is an interest-
ing question for future work how accurately internal shop data
could be inferred from externally visible data, and whether
increased breach data sharing among banks could potentially
allow for more accurate inferences.
5.4 Supply & Demand
Weekly supply of accounts increased consistently over the
lifetime of the shop, with a few signiﬁcant spikes. While
the shop added an overall average of 38,800 accounts per
week in 2015, Figure 4 shows a temporary increase to more
than 70,000 accounts per week in late 2015 and early 2016
(peaking at 123,929 accounts in one week). After that, aver-
age weekly supply increased each year, with 48,400 accounts
added weekly in 2016, 64,600 in 2017, and 93,600 in 2018
and 2019. Many of the spikes were due to large releases
from one or a few sellers, including the temporary increase in
late 2015 and early 2016, which was caused by an inﬂux of
accounts from Australia.
Weekly revenue, driven largely by magnetic stripe accounts
and shown in Figure 7, mirrors some but not all trends of sup-
ply. Perhaps not surprisingly, revenue grew only slowly in the
ﬁrst six months of the shop’s existence. The temporary spike
in inventory of late 2015/early 2016 was mirrored in increased
revenue, reaching more than $700k per week for nine weeks,
with a maximum of $904k. Most notably, revenue during
this period increased disproportionately for international mag-
netic stripe accounts, largely due to an inﬂux of accounts from
Australia. However, this effect subsided after a few months.
(We investigate international accounts in Section 7.2.) While
supply increased throughout the rest of the shop’s lifetime,
revenue never again exceeded $800k per week. This suggests
that the shop may have reached saturation in the magnetic
stripe market, or at least an excess of less desirable accounts.
The market for CNP accounts appeared to be in a different
situation. The ﬁrst such accounts were added to the shop
in October 2015, and never made up more than 1.7% of the
accounts available for purchase on the store. Sales of CNP,
however, accounted for up to 11% of the store’s weekly rev-
enue. The number of CNP accounts added to the store each
week grew at an average rate of 22.7% per week, over four
times as fast as the accumulation of unsold inventory (4.8%),
meaning that as supply of CNP accounts increased, demand

For comparison, magnetic stripe accounts
added to the store and unsold inventory grew at nearly iden-
tical rates of 4.0% and 3.7%, respectively. This indicates
potential latent demand for CNP accounts, in contrast to the
large back stock of less desirable magnetic stripe accounts.
Both the supply of accounts and spending of buyers ex-
hibited regional differences. We based regional data on the
zip code where the account was stolen for magnetic stripe
accounts, and the billing zip code for CNP. Figure 8 shows a
heatmap of this data in each state, normalized by capita. (We
excluded Washington, D.C., because its unique status as a sin-
gle city resulted in much higher per-capita spending than any
state.) For magnetic stripe sales, South Carolina was by far
the most popular state, with nearly one dollar spent per inhab-
itant (60% more than the next highest state). This ﬁnding is
consistent with customer support conversations encouraging
buyers to perform fraudulent magnetic stripe transactions in
the southeastern U.S., where anti-fraud measures were per-
ceived to be weaker. Colorado and Nevada stood out as hot
spots for accounts added, but not for spending. In 2018, one
seller added over 700 k accounts from Colorado and 230 k
accounts from Nevada. In Colorado, this amounted to nearly
eight times more accounts than all other years combined.
However, per-capita spending was only three times that of
other years, a much smaller proportional increase. In Nevada,
per-capita spending in 2018 decreased by 23% compared to
the previous year, despite the large increase in regional sup-
ply. These ﬁndings show that there may be factors other than
supply driving regional demand of magnetic stripe accounts.
Understanding these factors, whether they are possible secu-
rity deﬁciencies of banks based in the region, a local presence
of carder networks and other supporting criminal infrastruc-
ture, or simply a myth among carders, might illuminate what
makes speciﬁc accounts more susceptible to fraud attempts.
For CNP accounts, the “home” region of a stolen account
seemed to have little effect on purchasing habits. State-by-
state per-capita supply and spending were nearly identical,
suggesting that regional differences in demand were mainly a
consequence of availability. Cashing out an account online
requires less attention to the “home” region of the account,
since an online purchase can be placed using a proxy IP
address geolocated in the billing zip code, whereas in-person
transactions would require physical travel. Kansas stood out
as a hot spot, with 69% of accounts coming from a single
seller, and 93% of those accounts added in 2018.
The shop that we studied had difﬁculty supplying more
stolen CNP data. This is counter to prior research [13,14] and
therefore an important point for future work. Open questions
include whether this ﬁnding is limited to this speciﬁc shop,
due to the current stage of EMV transition in the United
States, or a more general effect hinting at CNP data being
more difﬁcult to steal at a larger scale.
5.5 Refunds
When customers purchase accounts, they can have their va-
lidity checked by the shop’s checker services. A declined
authorization could mean that the account has been ﬂagged as
stolen by the card issuer, and would allow the buyer to receive
a refund from the shop, subject to certain restrictions. One of
these restrictions is that the shop marks certain categories of
accounts as non-refundable.
Shop policies regarding refundability evolved over time.
The supply of refundable CNP accounts, for instance, de-
creased signiﬁcantly from 96% in 2015 to 17% in 2018, and
none of the CNP accounts added in January 2019 was listed
as refundable. In responses to support tickets, the shop admin
justiﬁed not granting refunds for most CNP accounts with
the difﬁculty of accurately checking their validity. Supply
of refundable magnetic stripe accounts, however, steadily in-
creased from 46% in 2015 to 84% in January 2019. Over the
entire dataset, 46% of purchased magnetic stripe accounts,
and 55% of purchased CNP, were sold as non-refundable.
Overall, the shop granted refunds for 1.9 M magnetic stripe
accounts amounting to $33.5 M of sales (34% of gross mag-
netic stripe revenue), and 49.5 k CNP accounts worth $597 k
(12% of gross CNP revenue).
Due to frequently changing refund rules, these trends do
not allow us to draw any direct conclusion about issuers’
anti-fraud performance. However, they illustrate the scale
and potential impact of this customer-friendly policy on the
shop’s revenue margin, as we will further discuss in Section 9.
6 Pricing Strategies
Based on a review of support tickets, it appears that the shop,
not sellers, were responsible for setting the prices of accounts.
These prices were not uniform, and ranged from $0.21 to
$256.76. The shop’s pricing strategy had two components,
the initial asking price, and a possible discount that could be
added at a later point for older back stock. In the following,
we present a preliminary exploration of initial and discounted
account prices. Our goal is to identify factors that may have
inﬂuenced pricing, which in turn provides us with indicators
for features that make stolen accounts more valuable.
Initial Asking Price. Through a random forest of decision
trees, we were able to predict the initial asking price of ac-
counts (irrespective of whether they were purchased) with an
R2 of 0.74 for magnetic stripe accounts. The average validity
of a batch of accounts, as indicated by the shop upon release,
explained 54% of pricing. According to customer support
tickets, the shop computed the validity of a release based
on 20 random accounts veriﬁed through one of the shop’s
checkers when obtaining the release from the seller. In the
dataset, the average initial price was $56.75 in magnetic stripe
releases with more than 95% validity, as opposed to $24.23
in releases advertised as having less than 40% validity. Com-

Figure 8: Seller supply (# of accounts) and gross buyer spending ($) per capita in each state. South Carolina stood out as a
popular area for both supply and demand of magnetic stripe accounts. Colorado and Nevada’s large supply was due to isolated

ments in the ticketing data further support the ﬁnding that
releases with lower percentages of valid accounts had lower
prices. Noteworthy additional features and their importance
included debit versus credit (11.4%), type (such as prepaid vs.
corporate cards, 10.4%), issuing bank (10.4%), and location
(7.1%). The average initial price of magnetic stripe debit
cards in the dataset was $15.33, whereas credit cards cost an
average of $24.49.
For CNP accounts, we did not encounter any pricing fea-
tures of signiﬁcant importance. While the decision tree anal-
ysis determined that release validity was the most important
feature for CNP pricing, the R2 was only 0.33, and the average
price difference for releases of different validity (segmented
as above) was less than one dollar.
Sale Price. A similar analysis on the price at which accounts
were purchased (after discounts) yielded similar results (R2 of
0.85 for magnetic stripe, and 0.34 for CNP). Again, the most
important feature was the average validity of the release (53%
for magnetic stripe, and 86% for CNP), followed by the time
during which the account had gone unsold on the shop (15%
and 10%, respectively). Figure 9 plots the “shelf time” of ac-
counts before they sold against the median price buyers paid
for them, as well as the number of items sold. Around 47%
of magnetic stripe sales, and 76% of CNP sales happened
during the ﬁrst 4 weeks of the account being added to the
shop. Presumably due to the much more limited supply, CNP
sales of older stock declined faster than for magnetic stripe
accounts. At the same time, purchase prices of CNP remained
relatively stable and did not appear to be correlated with the
account’s age. Magnetic stripe buyers, in contrast, tended to
purchase higher-priced accounts quickly within the ﬁrst few
weeks of being added. Median purchase prices of magnetic
stripe accounts initially started out higher than for CNP (at
$18.48), and gradually decreased to $2.91 for accounts 20
weeks and older. In customer support conversations, the shop
operators indicated that the validity rate of magnetic stripe
accounts decreases over time due to banks detecting the com-
mon point of purchase2 for breaches, while the validity rate

of stolen CNP accounts tends to remain more constant since
they often do not have a common point of purchase. However,
we cannot verify these claims.
Summary. The advertised validity rate of a release had the
most impact on listing price, while its time on the shop had
the largest impact on sale price. While our preliminary results
shed light on factors that appear to inﬂuence pricing, we also
note that we did not account for possible interactions between
features, or longitudinal trends such as the shop optimizing
the pricing strategy, or card issuers improving their anti-fraud
measures. Furthermore, it is an open question to which extent
these ﬁndings generalize to other carding shops.
for any overlap in their purchase history to infer a common location as the
likely source of the breach. This allows issuers to ﬂag additional accounts
used at this location as potentially compromised before fraud is attempted.

We investigate the varying attractiveness of magnetic stripe
accounts by segmenting them based on the issuer, network,
and type.3 We considered sets of accounts with a characteris-
tic to be more attractive if 1) customers purchased a higher
percentage of available accounts, or 2) customers purchased
accounts for a higher price. We analyze U.S. and interna-
tional accounts separately since U.S. accounts comprised
93% (17.4 M) of available magnetic stripe accounts, whereas
international accounts appeared to be more attractive overall.
7.1 U.S. Accounts
Shop customers bought stolen U.S. magnetic stripe accounts
from a total of 6,929 issuers. 43% of this spending was con-
centrated in the top 10 issuers, which were all larger national
U.S. banks (Table 2). While overall spending was in the
millions of dollars for each of these banks, there were notable
differences in how much of their inventory sold. Customers
purchased 83.2% of USAA Savings Bank accounts, for in-
stance, but only 27.0% of American Express-issued accounts.
We considered the next 104 entities medium-size issuers;
they accounted for 25% of spending. It is noteworthy that
in aggregate, the medium-size issuers had a higher fraction
of their inventory bought than any of the top 10 issuers, ex-
cept for USAA Savings Bank. Similar trends hold for the
remaining 6,815 small issuers, which accounted for 22% of
spending. For 10% of U.S. accounts we could not determine
the issuer;4 they accounted for 9% of spending.
There were notable differences in terms of the card network.
For the four major card networks, those with a higher rate of
purchase also had a higher median price. Carders paid the
lowest median price and purchased the smallest portion of
American Express cards, then Discover, Mastercard, and Visa.
Carders appeared to perceive American Express as having
stronger defenses against fraud. However, 28% of American
Express-branded accounts were issued by third-party issuers,
and it is unclear whether these perceived defenses were at the
issuer or card network level.
When segmenting by account type, prepaid debit accounts
stand out at a purchase rate of 67.6%, more than 25 percent-
age points higher than non-prepaid debit or credit accounts.
At the same time, prices paid were highest for credit accounts,
followed by prepaid debit, and lowest for other debit accounts.
The high purchase rate suggests that prepaid debit cards may
be perceived as having the weakest anti-fraud measures. The
slightly lower prices, in turn, might indicate that carders ex-
pect available balances to be lower than those of credit cards.
3We do not explore CNP accounts in this section since our prior analysis
suggested that account features did not signiﬁcantly affect their attractiveness.
4Resolving an account to an issuer is done based on lists of BIN-to-issuer
mappings. No complete authoritative list of these mappings was publicly
available, thus we used the resolution provided by the shop.
