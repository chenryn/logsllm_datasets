When `rust-bindgen` sets `cargo:rustc-link-search` to `/usr/local/lib` via `build.rs`, it can cause linking failures due to duplicate candidate dynamic libraries (dylibs) being found in both the bootstrap library directory (`/usr/local/lib`) and the Rust library directory (`/usr/local/lib/rustlib/../lib`).

Specific errors encountered include:

[Please provide the specific error messages here for further context and clarity.]

This issue arises because the linker is unable to resolve which version of the dylib to use, leading to conflicts during the build process. To resolve this, you may need to adjust the linker search paths or ensure that the correct versions of the libraries are used.
