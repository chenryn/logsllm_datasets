### Title: Blackhat EU-21: Picking Lockfiles - Attacking and Defending Your Supply Chain

**Abstract:**

Open-source software (OSS) development benefits from public contributions, which can enhance features and improve the overall quality of the project. However, this collaborative nature also makes OSS projects vulnerable to supply chain attacks. In this presentation, we explore both offensive and defensive perspectives on a technique that hides malicious code in open-source contributions, thereby reducing the likelihood of detection during code review.

Our technique exploits lockfiles, which are commonly used by modern package managers to ensure deterministic resolution of dependencies. We have identified several key observations:
1. Package managers often do not adequately verify the integrity of lockfiles.
2. Lockfiles are machine-generated, and minor modifications can easily go unnoticed during code reviews due to the large volume of changes.
3. The widespread use of third-party packages and package managers in OSS projects further exacerbates the risk.

For blue teams, we provide a lightweight tool designed to verify the integrity of lockfiles, suitable for integration into continuous integration (CI) pipelines. For red teams, we demonstrate both manual and automated methods for selecting targets and tampering with lockfiles. We also share relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and offer guidance on what to look for when defending against or simulating such attacks.

This work builds upon the research by Liran Tal [1], expanding it by introducing additional methods for tampering with lockfiles, applying these methods to other programming ecosystems (Ruby on Rails and Go, in addition to Node.js), and providing tools for verifying lockfile integrity and automating the tasks of targeting suitable dependencies and tampering with lockfiles.
