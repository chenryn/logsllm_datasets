ABSTRACT
Residential Internet connectivity is growing at a phenomenal
rate. A number of recent studies have attempted to character-
ize this connectivity—measuring coverage and performance
of last-mile broadband links—from a various vantage points
on the Internet, via wireless APs, and even with user cooper-
ation. These studies, however, sacriﬁce accuracy or require
substantial human time. In this work, we present a novel
two-pass method to characterize neighborhood networks. We
demonstrate that the two pass method dramatically reduces
the time spent in active measurement while retaining ac-
curacy. A case study on two neighborhoods in Pittsburgh
provide new and accurate insights into broadband connec-
tivity, including throughput, broadband coverage (DSL vs.
cable vs. ﬁber), NAT conﬁgurations, DHCP, DNS usage.
The results further characterize 802.11 connectivity in the
neighborhood.

INTRODUCTION

Over the past few years, residential network connectivity has
undergone a number of dramatic changes. Residences have
moved from using dialup to using a broad range of wireless
technology within the home and a mix of broadband DSL,

cable modem and ﬁber-based technologies to connect homes
to the Internet. The result of the increase in broadband
connectivity is that residential Internet use has far more
impact on the Internet than it did in the past.
Unfortunately, there is relatively little work that charac-
terizes typical network connectivity to the home user. Most
existing measurement studies, datasets and tools target the
core of the Internet. A few recent studies have attempted
to characterize residential broadband connectivity. These
studies have used three types of measurements: Internet-
based [6], home-user driven [9], and wireless access point
(AP) based measurements [8]. Internet-based measurement
studies, which probe residential links from remote Internet
locations, have been the largest in scale. However, these
studies suﬀer from measurement noise and inaccuracy since
the measurements are performed far from the target links.
While studies that rely on users to perform tests at their
homes greatly improve accuracy, they require signiﬁcant user
participation to collect results. Finally, measuring connectiv-
ity using wireless APs also provides accurate characterization
of connectivity but requires signiﬁcant time from the indi-
viduals performing the measurements. This tends to limit
the scale of such studies.
In this paper, we adopt the wireless AP-based approach
to measuring residential connectivity. Unlike the other two
approaches, AP-based measurement allows us to focus on
neighborhood-level connectivity and answer questions about
how residential connectivity varies within a small geographic
area.
In addition to the measurement study, one of the
key contributions of this paper is a set of measurement
tools and methods, called Mark-and-Sweep, that ensures the
accurate and time eﬃcient collection of wireless-AP based
measurements in a neighborhood (Section 2). We achieve
these improvements by dividing the measurement task into
a two stage process.
In the ﬁrst stage, we drive around
the neighborhood and passively record all transmissions we
observe along with GPS coordinates. This gives us a map
of the APs within a neighborhood and key properties (e.g.
SSID, security settings, channel, signal strength at diﬀerent
locations) of the APs. Using this data, we prune out APs with
low signal strength and identify ideal locations to perform
active measurements for the rest of the APs. In the second
stage, we drive to the chosen locations and perform detailed
active probing of the APs to measure properties of their
wireless network and last-mile connectivity.
We have performed this two-pass measurement of resi-
dential connectivity in a densely populated neighborhood
near Carnegie Mellon University and a more sparsely popu-
lated suburban neighborhood in Pittsburgh. In this paper,
we analyze these measurements to evaluate the beneﬁts of
Mark-and-Sweep (Section 3) and to answer key questions
about residential connectivity (Section 4). We compare the
measurement performance of Mark-and-Sweep with the tradi-
tional approach of stopping every few homes (approximately
every 75 ft) and performing a set of active measurements.
Our results show that Mark-and-Sweep identiﬁes just as
many APs and provides similar or better accuracy for its
active probes as the traditional approach; more importantly,
Mark-and-Sweep obtained these measurements almost six
times faster.
We use the above measurements to consider how eﬀectively
an ISP could provide roaming wireless connectivity in a
neighborhood and how wireless connectivity could be used
to allow users to access wired last-mile links in other homes.
While some of the observations are obviously speciﬁc to the
neighborhoods measured, we believe that our results highlight
useful measurement and analysis methods for answering
such questions. Our tools and data can also be used to
evaluate a wide range of questions regarding the design of
access networks and the feasibility of neighborhood-wide
applications or networks. Mark-and-Sweep and the data
presented in this paper are publicly available.1
2. MARK-AND-SWEEP
Our method for collecting network information focuses on
achieving two goals: (1) ensuring an accurate set of collected
data; (2) maximizing the amount of data collected for the
amount of human time invested in taking measurements.
Our experience, and that of others [5, 8], demonstrates
that the largest percentage of time associated with obtaining
detailed measurements collected through wireless networks is
in the scanning, per-AP association, DHCP, and subsequent
broadband tests. These stages of the measurement process
are particularly slow when measurements are taken in an
area of poor signal strength. In addition, poor signal strength
can degrade measurements of broadband performance (the
wireless medium may be too slow or lossy to permit accurate
measurement).
To address this potential ineﬃciency, we use a two-pass
measurement scheme. In the ﬁrst pass, we drive through an
area without stopping, collecting extensive passive measure-
ments of all APs. We do not associate with APs during this
pass. We use these measurements to create a plan for the
second pass, in which we measure each access point and its
associated network in-depth exactly once at the approximate
location where its signal strength was the strongest.
Pass 1: Access point identiﬁcation and location.
The goal of the ﬁrst pass is to determine which APs are in an
area, approximately where those APs are located, and where
their signal strength is the strongest. This information has
been the focus of a number of war-driving eﬀorts (see Wiggle,
WiFiMaps, PlaceLab), and data from previously war-driven
areas could be used as input to our tool.
Movement pattern: During these runs, we scan all streets
in the targeted area at least twice (usually once per side)
using kismet. Since we are only passively recording data,
we can cover a given geographic area rapidly and drive at
approximately 20 mph during this pass. Multiple passes
through the same location ensure that we identify all APs
that have a reasonably strong signal and are transmitting
packets including data and beacons.
Measurements collected : For each AP detected, we record
its bssid, essid, channel, encryption methods, and supported
rates. In addition, we record the signal strength of every
packet heard, and the GPS coordinates of the observation.
Between passes: Access point preprocessing. Based
on the collected information, we determine which access
points to measure in depth and the optimal locations for
such measurements. The preprocessing has two parts:
AP Pruning: The list of APs is pruned to include only
unencrypted APs with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of
20 dB or larger. In Section 3, we oﬀer justiﬁcation for this
threshold. This pruning eliminates weak APs where the
measurements either 1) are likely to fail; or 2) are likely to be
wireless-bottlenecked to the extent that they do not provide
insight on the actual residential broadband link.
Path Planning: Given the list of APs to measure and the
map of all AP observations for a neighborhood, we identify
the location where each AP’s signal was the strongest. We
then determine an order in which to visit these locations that
minimizes driving time. Currently, path-planning is done
manually; a future version of the tool will use path planning
software to suggest an eﬃcient route to visit the APs.
Pass 2: In-depth network characterization. The
second pass of war driving collects detailed wireless and
wired network measurements from targeted access points.
We use a combination of kismet (for discovery) and wicrawl
2 (as an infrastructure to run individual tests on each AP).
Movement pattern: When taking measurements during this
pass, we use “war-parking” instead of war-driving. The driver
stops at the locations speciﬁed during the preprocessing phase
and searches for access points in range for testing. We use
the Navit open source mapping software to plot the testing
locations and the current location of the testing vehicle. A
custom application integrates the mapping, location checking,
and ﬁltering of the speciﬁc access points to be tested. This
application informs the driver when to stop to conduct the
tests, starts a ﬁltered version of wicrawl speciﬁc to access
points to be tested at that location, and ﬁnally updates
the map and removes access points that have been tested
successfully.
Measurements collected for each AP : The tool ﬁrst attempts
to connect to each access point. Next, it sends ﬁve DHCP
requests in a row to quickly obtain an IP address, using
the ﬁrst response it receives. The tool records the entire
DHCP response for later analysis. If the association or DHCP
attempts fail, the tool prompts the user to reposition the
vehicle and attempt the test once more.
Once it has an IP address on the target wireless LAN, the
tool performs ﬁve tests:
1. Ping. Ping a test server in the CMCL lab at Carnegie
Mellon University.
2. Port Availability. Attempt to open a TCP connection
to the test server on ﬁve ports: 25 (SMTP), 80 (HTTP),

is an open source tool available at http://
443 (HTTPS), 587 (authenticated SMTP) and 56123
(a high-numbered port).
3. Traceroute. Run traceroute to the test server.
4. NAT. Use the open source STUN client/server to
determine the NAT type.
5. Throughput. Send UDP packets at 15 Mbps for 4 sec-
onds to measure upstream and downstream bandwidth
to the test server (if the success rate exceeds 90% we
increase the transmission rate). We use a version of
nuttcp that we modiﬁed to work through NATs.
While collecting these measurements, we simultaneously
use tcpdump to record a packet dump of all sent/received
traﬃc on the laptop’s second wireless interface (running in
monitor mode). We use this packet trace to help determine
which measurements are aﬀected by poor quality in the
wireless medium. At the end of this process, we parse the
collected data ﬁles (kismet output and GPS log from pass 1;
association, GPS and experiment log from pass 2; and packet
dump from the monitor NIC in pass 2) and insert the results
in a database for further analysis.
3. METHOD EVALUATION
Our two-pass method has two potential beneﬁts: 1) reducing
the total amount of time required to characterize a neigh-
borhood network, and 2) improving the accuracy of the
collected measurements, compared to alternate approaches.
Time savings come from careful planning that allows us to
stop and collect detailed measurements only once for each
AP. Accuracy improvements (particularly for performance
metrics such as latency and throughput) come from choosing
a single measurement location with a high-quality wireless
link, thereby removing, as much as possible, any wireless
medium bottlenecks.
To validate the two beneﬁts of our method, we compared
Mark-and-Sweep to two alternate measurement schemes in
a smaller geographical area with 40 unencrypted APs. The
alternate schemes work as follows: We drive through the
given area, stopping to collect measurements every 75 ft. At
each stop, we discover all APs, associate with each one and
collect all measurements of Mark-and-Sweep’s pass 2. We
then deﬁne two measurement schemes: one that performs
detailed active measurements only once per AP at the time
that DHCP ﬁrst succeeds (Measure-First) and one that per-
forms detailed active measurements for all APs at each stop
(Measure-All). Measure-First aims to reduce the time taken
by performing active measurements as soon as possible and
only once; Measure-All aims to improve accuracy by mea-
suring the same AP multiple times and reporting the best
value.
We compare the total amount of time spent in active mea-
surement, number of APs that were successfully measured
and UDP throughput for each scheme in Table 1. We report
the average UDP throughput for the APs whose maximum
SNR is greater than 20dB to provide a fair comparison, and
show the UDP throughput distribution for all APs from
Measure-All in Figure 1. The measured throughput values
for Mark-and-Sweep are as accurate as Measure-All’s but are
collected almost 6 times faster. The faster Measure-First is
2.7 times slower than Mark-and-Sweep and reports through-
put measurements that rarely exceed 2 Mbps. These results
attest to the importance of measuring at the location of the
best wireless signal. The APs that were pruned by Mark-
and-Sweep for pass 2 provide very low throughput (Figure 1)

and will always be wireless-bottlenecked even at the best
location. We prune 4 APs, a relatively high fraction of APs,
in this test area because the test area is small and we observe
many weak signals of APs that are located outside the test
area. Later in this section, we report the actual number
of DHCP-able APs we might have missed because of the
threshold.
Mark-and-Sweep uses a 20 dB threshold to decide whether
to collect detailed measurements from an AP. A similar
criterion could be used by Measure-All. We report on the
results of such a scheme, Measure-All(Thresh), in Table 1.
To further validate the choice of 20 dB as a cutoﬀ threshold,
we quantify the number of plausible measurement points
we lose due to such thresholding in a neighborhood where
we actually performed the measurement (SQ in Section 4).
Given the poor quality of the wireless link at less than 20 dB
SNR values, DHCP leases rarely succeed. The total DHCP
successes from APs that had maximum SNR value less than
20dB was only 9 out of 181 such APs.
4. RESULTS
Mark-and-Sweep enables us to gain an accurate view of
neighborhood networks today. Below, we provide a sample
of the ﬁndings one can derive using the collected measure-
ments (Mark-and-Sweep can be easily extended to include
more measurements). We measured two neighborhoods in
Pittsburgh: Squirrel Hill (denoted SQ) and part of Ross
and McCandless Township (RMT) in suburban Pittsburgh.3
While both neighborhoods are mainly residential, the Squir-
rel Hill area is more densely packed with detached homes,
townhouses and small apartments. The areas we wardrove
span 1.3 sq. km for Squirrel Hill and 3 sq. km for Ross and
McCandless Township.
