A description and proposal
DAN CALDWELL
The  policies  for  the  safety  and  control  mechanisms  for  nuclear  weapons
have only recently attracted public attention.1 This article will focus first on
the  development  and  deployment  of  permissive  action  links  (PAL)  by  the
United  States and then turn to the nuclear control technology  and policies
of other countries.  It will conclude with  a consideration  of the  advisability
of  the  United  States  providing  information  concerning  permissive  action
links to  other  countries.
The development of permissive action links
In  1958 the  US  Congress,  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Department  of
Defense,  amended  the 1954 Atomic Energy Act to allow for  dispersion of
nuclear  weapons  to  American  allies  in  Europe.  In  addition,  the  Depart-
ment  of  Defense  proposed  that  military  personnel  from  NATO  countries
receive  training  concerning  the  firing  of  nuclear  weapons.  Within  four
months,  Thor and Jupiter missiles were being installed in Britain, Italy and
Turkey,  and  military personnel  from  these countries were being trained in
the operation of nuclear weapons.2 To assure that the United States would
retain  custody  and  control of these nuclear  weapons, the  'two-key'  system
was  adopted.  According  to  this  procedure,  two  keys  were  required  to
launch a nuclear weapon.  One  key was to be in the possession of a British,
Italian  or  Turkish  officer  and  the  other  on  the  person  of  a  US  officer.
While  visiting  a  Thor  missile  base  at  Feltwell,  England,  in  June  1959,
however,  Congressman  Charles  O.  Porter  found  that  the  British  missile
control  officer  possessed  both  his  key  and  the  second  key  that  was
supposed  to be  in  American  control.  Congressman  Porter  noted  that  this
lapse  in  regulations  meant  that  '.  .  . the  American  legal  reservation  of
control  would  have  been  effectively  short-circuited  so  far  as  the  use  of
atomic  warheads  were  concerned  on  those  particular  missiles'.3
Even  when  regulations  were  observed,  the  two-key  system  did  not
guarantee  that  nuclear  weapons  would  remain  under  American  control.
For  example,  following  a  1960  fact-finding  trip  to  US  missile  bases  in
Europe by members of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy  (JCAE), the
executive director of the committee said: 'We were scared stiff by what we
saw  . ..  we wondered what would happen  if,  for some reason -  two NATO
states falling out, perhaps -  the Turk [i.e., a non-US missile control  officer]

Why,  the Turk  would  have  himself  a  modern  weapon,  that's  what.'4
Added  to this concern  was that  regarding  nuclear weapons  stationed  in
the Federal  Republic of  Germany.  According  to one member  of  the  1960
JCAE  trip,  'We  landed  in  West  Germany  and  saw  all  of  these  German
planes with  German  [Maltese] crosses and  an eighteen-year-old  American
private with a rifle to guard US nuclear weapons. I was not reassured.'5  As
a  result  of  all  of  the  concerns  that  were  revealed  during  the  JCAE  trip  to
Europe,  Harold  Agnew  of  the  Los  Alamos  Laboratory  wrote  a  letter  to
Major  General  A.  D.  Starbird,  the  director  of  the  military  applications
division of the US Atomic Energy  Commission, soon after  his return  from
Europe. In this letter, Dr Agnew pointed out: 'It was apparent that several
potentially  serious problems  may  exist under  the  present  arrangements of
custody  and control of weapons and with the safety  of certain weapons we
have furnished  the NATO community'.6 Agnew went on to recommend  'that
a  coded  arming control  device be provided  in those  NATO weapons  which
must  have  a ready  capability'.7
The  need  for  safety  mechanisms  on  nuclear  weapons  was  underscored
on  the day  that John  Kennedy  was inaugurated,  20 January  1961, when  a
B-52  flying  from  El  Paso,  Texas,  to  Utah  exploded  enroute.  Four  days
later a B-52 carrying two 24-megaton bombs crashed outside of Goldsboro,
North  Carolina,  during  a  routine  training  mission.  The  chemical  high-
explosive yield of one bomb was detonated  by the impact of the crash  but
this did not detonate the nuclear  material  in the  bomb. All but one of  the
other  bomb's  safety  mechanisms  were  triggered,  and  had  the  final
mechanism  been  triggered,  the  bomb  would  have  gone  off.8
These  incidents  deeply  disturbed  President  Kennedy,  for  they  clearly
and  dramatically  showed  the  possibility  of  a  serious  nuclear  weapons
accident.  In addition,  Kennedy  was aware of the shortcomings of the two-
key system  in  Europe.  Stemming  from  these  concerns,  Kennedy  ordered
US  scientists  at  the  Los  Alamos,  Livermore  and  Sandia  labs  to  develop
new systems for  insuring US control  of nuclear weapons. The work  of  the
scientists  had  been  preceded  by  a  conceptual  description  of  an  improved
control  procedure  written  by  a  social  scientist  at  the  Rand  Corporation,
Fred  Ikle, who had  proposed  that  the US should place electronic locks or
'permissive  action  links'  on  US  nuclear  weapons.
Ikle's idea was taken  up by the  Kennedy  Administration  and  translated
into reality by the scientists and weapons designers in the nuclear weapons
labs,  and  PAL  were  installed  on  many  US  land-based  nuclear  weapons  in
the  1960s.  Interestingly,  PAL were  not  (and  have  not  been  to  the  present
date)  placed  on  nuclear  weapons  deployed  on  US  Navy  ships  or
submarines.9  In  fact,  the  only  naval  nuclear  weapons  to  have  PAL are
nuclear  depth  charges  that  are  stored  on  land.
What  is  a  permissive  action  link?  Permissive  action  links  can  be  very
simple.  Indeed,  early  PAL were  simple  electro-mechanical  combination
locks.  When  the  correct  numerical  code  was  fed  into  the  PAL device,  the
electrical  circuit  of  the  nuclear  weapon  was  completed  and  the  weapon

could  be  detonated,  assuming  that  the  other  safety  procedures  (e.g.,  the
'two-man  rule')  were  followed.  Initially,  PAL were  simply  attached  to  the
electrical circuitry of nuclear weapons. Weapons designers recognized  that
it  would  be  relatively  easy  to  'wire  around'  these  early  PAL and  they
subsequently  'buried'  the  PAL devices  deep  inside  the  weapon,  making
them  virtually  inaccessible  to  anyone  trying  to  arm  a  weapon  without
authorization.  In  addition,  weapons  designers  of  more  recent  PAL have
encapsulated  the  entire  nuclear weapon  or the  PAL with a protective  skin.
Any  penetration  of  this covering results in  automatic, irreparable  damage
to  the  weapon,  making  it  impossible  to  detonate.  Vice  Admiral  Gerald
Miller has offered  the best general description of  PAL in the open literature:
The  Permissive  Action  Link  (PAL)  Program  consists  of  a  code  system
and  a family  of  devices integral  or  attached  to  nuclear  weapons  which
have  been  developed  to  reduce  the  probability  of  an  unauthorized
nuclear  detonation.  The  devices are  designed  to  preclude  the  use  of  a
nuclear  weapon  without  first  inserting  the  correct  numerical  code.  The
code  system  is a  highly  secure  system  which  permits  the  using  unit  to
obtain  the  proper  numerical  code  only  after  the  PAL  unlock  has  been
authorized.
As  the  above  discussion  indicates,  several  generations  of  permissive
action  links  have  been  developed  and  deployed  by  the  United  States.
Table  1 presents data on  the category of  PAL deployed  on various types of
US  nuclear  weapons.

Given  the sensitivity of the subject,  it is difficult  to find information  about
the  nuclear  weapons control  technology  of  other  countries.11 This  section
examines  the  policies  of  Britain,  France,  the  Soviet  Union,  the  People's
Republic of China, Israel, India  and Pakistan. For each of these countries,
the  section  will  describe  the  nature  of  its  nuclear  arsenal,  the  political
authority  with  control  over  nuclear  weapons,  and  the  nuclear  weapons
control  technology  possessed  by  each  country.
BRITAIN
The mainstay of the British  nuclear arsenal  currently consists of 64 Polaris
submarine-launched  ballistic  missiles  (of  either  the  A-3  or  A-3TK
Chevaline type) deployed on four Resoliition-dass  submarines. In addition,
Britain  has tactical  nuclear  bombs  and  nuclear  depth  bombs.12 It  also  has
Programs of Cooperation  with the United  States for  Lance  missiles and its
artillery, whereby  the  US provides the  nuclear  warhead  and  Britain  owns
and  operates  the  delivery  system.
As a member of NATO, Britain has committed its forces to the defence of
member countries. The 'Athens Guidelines' adopted by NATO in May 1962
stipulate  that  nuclear  weapons  will  be  used  only  after  consulting  with
other  members  'time  and  circumstances  permitting'  and  unless  'supreme
national  interests'  are  at  stake.  British  nuclear  forces  are  deployed  and
targeted  according  to  Alliance  plans  and  are  highly  integrated  with  US
forces  and  plans.  The  parts  of  Britain's  tactical  nuclear  capability  which
involves  US  warheads  are  subject  to  the  same  command  and  control
arrangements  as  US  tactical  nuclear  warheads.13
The  authority  in  Britain  to  release  nuclear  weapons  rests  with  the
Parliament;  however,  in  practice  the  Prime  Minister  is  responsible  for
directing  British  defence.  If  the  NATO  commander  decided  that  nuclear
weapons  were  necessary,  SACEUR  on  his  own  or  at  the  request  of  a
