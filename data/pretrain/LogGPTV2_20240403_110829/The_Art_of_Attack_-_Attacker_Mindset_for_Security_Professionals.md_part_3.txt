ity enough that allows repurposing of information when a situa-
tion calls for it and the agility to adapt the information in ways not
always intended by the source; and finally, this mindset requires
self- awareness. Self- awareness is invisible. No one can “see” that
you are self- aware, but almost everyone can feel if you are or not.
You must leave people feeling however you need them to in order
to fulfill your objective. I will cover this in a later chapter on target
psychology.
The Attacker and the Mindset
It’s silly to argue about the “true” meaning of a word—a word
means whatever people believe it to mean— but for me, “hacking”
information through AMs means using information in ways unan-
ticipated by the original source. Just as a hacker uses something in
a way it was not intended to be used, an attacker uses information
in a way it was not intended. This gives AMs a sense of neutrality
on the surface, but delving a little deeper into it, it encompasses
the art of the mindset seamlessly: information exists, and we are
free to process it and apply it however we want. A great attacker
will always apply information for the good of the attack; they will
always bend and twist the information in a way that furthers the
mission or gains the objective.
In the most traditional sense, an attacker is an individual, or a
group of individuals, who seeks to destroy, expose, alter, disable,
and steal information or to gain unauthorized access to or make
unauthorized use of an asset or person. Attackers are often por-
trayed as ruthless individuals with almost otherworldly skills and
the means to win against their victims. They will try to find the path
of least resistance for the biggest gain. To an extent this is true, but
10 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
as we have already covered in part, an attacker’s main ammo is the
leveraging and weaponization of information— without this, they
are powerless. The world runs on data now, so information is abun-
dantly available. Malicious attackers will use information to gain
information from their targets; ethical attackers will do the same
but will teach the targets how their own information can be used
against them, how to recognize when that is happening, and how
to prevent it.
There are two main states of attacker mindset: there’s before
the vulnerable information has been carved out and there’s after.
One commonality exists between them: every step you take as an
attacker must go in the direction of the objective. The nature of
AMs means it boils down to forming information around the objec-
tive, inferring in cases, leveraging information where possible, and
concealing other information where needed. These are the core
competencies that make up AMs, and we are about to start untan-
gling them. But it is prudent to note that you do not need the skills
to understand the laws of AMs, and you do not need the laws to
use the skills. It’s the application of the skills against the laws that
makes the mindset:
• The first law of AMs states that you start with the end in mind,
knowing your objective. This will allow you to use laws 2, 3, and
4 most effectively.
• Law 2 states that you gather, weaponize, and leverage informa-
tion for the good of the objective. This is how you serve law 1.
• Law 3 says that you never break pretext. You must remain dis-
guised as a threat at all times.
• Law 4 tells you that everything you do is for the benefit of the
objective. The objective is the central point from which all moves
an attacker makes hinge. You cannot diverge from the objective
set out because of law 1.
It is the interwoven use of five cognitive skills that form the
backbone of the attacker mindset:
1. You cannot become a good ethical attacker without a healthy
dose of curiosity.
What Is the Attacker Mindset? 11
2. Your curiosity will not pay off without persistence.
3. You will have nothing to persist in if you cannot take in infor-
mation and leverage the most mundane of it correctly.
4. You will need to have mental agility enough to actively adapt
information in the moment.
5. If you have all of these skills, you will still only succeed if you
have a high level of self-a wareness, because you must always
know what you bring and how to leverage it. Self- awareness
will allow you a higher level of influence over someone else.
These five things play a role in every job you will get as an ethi-
cal attacker looking to succeed.
AMs Is a Needed Set of Skills
Defenses against attackers generally center on building techno-
logical protections to combat ever-l urking adversaries. Businesses
typically try to fortify their assets by closing off the most obscure
entry points, which is commendable. But it becomes irrelevant
if they leave the front door wide open rather than employing an
active defense. Attackers are often relentless and dogged types
(and need to be in order to succeed). Protecting against this can be
difficult, because the threat is somewhat faceless and motionless
until one day it’s not—h ow can we truly protect ourselves against
such a faceless, shapeless entity, you may wonder? Something that
doesn’t seem like it’s a threat at all until one day it appears, and
it is tangible, dangerous, and consequential. Looking the threat in
the face leaves most companies wondering how they could have
missed imagining the scenario in which they find themselves, and
the truth is there are infinite attack scenarios. Imagining and bar-
ricading against them all is futile. Learning to think like an attacker,
seeing how information about you can be used against you, will
not stop it from happening, but it will make halting attacks in their
tracks that much easier. It’s the closest thing to a security panacea I
will see in my working lifetime, of that I have no doubt.
People, typically not in the cybersecurity or information security
industries, wonder if it’s safe or even ethical to teach people how
12 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
to think like an attacker, whether that be teaching a penetration
tester how to break into networks or a social engineer how to elicit
information and use it against a target. My response is always this:
the solution to successfully fending off attacks and staying ahead of
them is to be able to think like those who would seek to attack us.
I am not teaching people to be malevolent or corrupt; I am teaching
them to how to be ethical— testing people, companies, and secu-
rity for our greater good. When a company is attacked, regardless if
they left themselves open to it or not, it affects the people who work
there; it affects the people who used the services. This should not
be overlooked or taken lightly. Because of the stakes, we must have
only trusted individuals within our workplaces, or the information
security/cybersecurity sectors test our businesses.
Also, as I have said in the introduction and countless times
before, whether it be when asked by people curious about my pro-
fession or in interview and training settings, putting the word ethi-
cal, or some variation of it, before the word attacker will not make
the words that follow invisible to malicious actors. I also cannot
control who buys this book. But I believe that learning to think like
a malicious attacker can and will help us, as security professionals,
get ahead, stay ahead, and beat them. We take their power when we
can think like them, but with a purer intent.
As a society, we test everything: we test our cars to see how
they’ll fare on impact, we test buildings for structural safety, we
even test markets before launching products. We train our emer-
gency personnel, too, and rightly so. We wouldn’t simply place a
person in front of a burning building with a hose expecting them to
put it out; we test our firefighters, give them experience and build
their skills. The same goes for many other professions. As busi-
nesses, we can and should test everything. “Everything” includes
human- based defenses. Testing people against ostensibly malicious
attacks is tactical, daunting, and dynamic, but it works as a way of
upping security, and it’s the next great defense in security for busi-
nesses, and for us all. One of the most effective ways to uncover
flaws and weaknesses in a business’s security posture is to carry out
planned attacks, exposing gaps in their defenses before a malicious
attacker can take advantage.
What Is the Attacker Mindset? 13
Finally, while testing people is of course not teaching them the
attacker mindset, it is teaching them how an attack might rear its
ugly head and that alone gives them defenses against it. So, as secu-
rity professionals, it’s also our duty to form attack methods that,
once executed, have no long- lasting adverse effects on the popula-
tion tested— a major contrast when compared to those breeched by
a malicious attacker. After all, some of the most devastating attacks
haven’t been the most technical— they’ve simply been human ver-
sus human. The catch is that only one human knows about the
attack as it unfolds. By offering insight into the principles of AMs,
we should be able to move the needle on security in the right direc-
tion without adversely affecting the population.
A Quick Note on Scope
The word scope will be used frequently throughout this book and
chapter. It refers to a document that is an agreement on the work
you’re going to perform for a client. It outlines what you can and
cannot do. It is your get out- of- jail- free card if you are caught (if you
stuck to the terms of it) and possibly your never- go- to- actual- jail
card if you are caught (if you stuck to the terms of it).
The scope will permit you to do a whole host of things, like
enter a building from any given area or use real employee names
in a phish. It might let you break into a building during the day but
not at night (within normal working hours), or it might allow you
to impersonate employees, both in person and over the phone. It is
decided by the client.
Here’s the bottom line of scope: you don’t have to do everything
scope permits. You cannot do a single thing it prohibits. Ensure
you understand scope before you embark on the work. Make sure
it uses clear language, and make sure you clarify anything you are
unsure of.
Collectively, as a team, we’ve broken into hundreds of serv-
ers and physically compromised many of the world’s most tightly
guarded corporate and government facilities, including banks,
corporate headquarters, and defense sites. However, I am always
struck by how James Bond–like people think the job is. Each job is
14 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
a long process that looks at legalities, operational conflicts that have
to be worked around, and deliverables.
The first phase of the process is aligning with the target, pick-
ing a period in which to attack and defining the scope. To discuss
that in great detail is beyond the range of this book, although an
important point about scope should be made: scope limits what you
do, not how you think. Breaking that down a little further, the scope
matters to you because it tells you what you are and are not allowed
to do— if you are not allowed to impersonate an internal employee,
then you might pivot to impersonating a contractor. You may not be
allowed to spoof numbers or name drop, so your AMs will have to
forge ahead, giving you deceptive and creative ideas to offset those
limitations. For instance, if you can’t spoof numbers, you might get
a burner number that’s a few digits off from the one the target will
expect. If you can’t name drop, you might use names that sound
close to the one. If scope limits you from using tools, like card clon-
ers, then you might have to use a look- alike card and feign a tech-
nical error when it won’t permit you access. Basically, scope adds
complexities to your job, but it doesn’t limit the power of your AMs;
it simply exercises it in different ways.
There are good and bad outcomes that arise from having a scope
in place. Primarily it is a protection for you as an attacker, which
is why stepping outside the lines of them can be so damaging and
devastating, both to your company and to your career. They are pro-
tection for the target, too. Most often you will hear new people in
the field saying a real attacker would never stick to scope, so why
should they? This is more complex than you’d first think. The first
part of the statement is true; an attacker does not have a scope to
stick to. However, if the client is asking you to go after the same
asset that a real and malicious attacker would, the outcome is the
same. Your clients should train their staff on how to spot attacks
even when they are using spoofed numbers and impersonation, but
if you are able to successfully breach them with these limitations in
place, you further hit home to them how vulnerable they are. Scope
is an attacker’s blessing in disguise.
What Is the Attacker Mindset? 15
There are, however, grounds to challenge scope. If the client is
too extreme in either direction, without good cause, you should—
professionally—b e able to point out to them how it precludes valu-
able testing. For instance, if you are vishing a bank and the client
doesn’t want you to use any semblance of an existing department as
your pretext, you might point out that such limitations are heavily
skewed in a way that will impact the findings and go against their
security posture and future mitigations. It’s too far removed from a
realistic attack scenario.
However, if you are breaking into a government facility and the
client doesn’t want you to take any device in that’s able to film or
photograph, that shouldn’t be too much of a concern for you as long
as a mechanism is in place for you to prove your successes (and
failures). Some clients will want a representative to accompany you;
others will want you to check in at different points throughout the
building. In the case of most pen tests, you will usually screenshot
your progress. However, some clients will prohibit this and use their
own logs as an example.
We will not cover report writing, although it is a large part of a
job for most clients. What I will say about reports is that they should
not be approached with fear or loathing. Equally, they should not
be treated as precious. They are a way for you to give a coherent
and exhaustive rundown of what you did from start to end and to
give recommendations based on all of that. Giving the client all the
vulnerabilities you saw but didn’t take is important, too. I care more
for a simple and easy report to both write and to read. There’s still
an element of AMs law involved in writing them: you must know
the objective of the report (to show them where they are vulnerable
and how to close those vulnerabilities); you must be able to take
the information you gathered and describe it effectively, leverag-
ing it for the report; you will have to stay professional the entire
report— it is not a document for you to write your moves out like a
screenplay; and you must always keep the objective of the report in
mind so that it doesn’t drift in the direction of fiction or in the direc-
tion of data only, without fixes.
16 THE ATTACKER MINDSET
Summary
• Attacker mindset can be used from your computer, but it really
can’t be taught there. It’s a set of skills and laws working in
combination.
• AMs is a set of cognitive skills applied to four laws. Used
together, they produce an advantage for the attacker and a dis-
advantage of the target.
• Teaching the attacker mindset to those who don’t seek to harm
us, but to protect us, will greatly impact our successes in infor-
mation security going forward.
• The following chapters present a complete system for building
this mentality and untangling the complex web of thinking and
resulting actions that make an attacker mindset so formidable.
• Reports are, for most people, the least fun part of the job but the
most important part for the client.
Key Message
War is 90 percent information; the rest is how you apply it to the
objective. An attacker takes in information to achieve an objec-
tive, but instead of profiting in the end, an ethical attacker seeks
to strengthen defenses they circumvented or defeated. AMs’ larg-
est commodity is information; it is the use of this information that
defines the attacker and the attack.
To carry out the acts of an attacker requires curiosity and
persistence, which are interdependent as one often drives the other.
Information processing is another important skill. A subset of infor-
mation processing is mental agility— you cannot use information
agilely if you cannot first parse it. Self-a wareness is the ability to use
yourself in a way that is beneficial for the objective.
Chapter 2
Offensive vs. Defensive
Attacker Mindset
B
efore we dive into the components of the mindset, it is
worthwhile to categorize it into its offensive and defensive
sides. In this chapter, we will briefly look at what offensive
and defensive security is and how they differ from each other. Then
we will look at the offensive and defensive side of the mindset and
what each side brings to its security counterpart in terms of skill
and functionality.
Many millions of dollars in public and private investment have
been spent on new technologies, usually for defensive measures
rather than offensive. Offensive security is a proactive and an oppo-
sitional approach to protecting computer systems, networks, and
individuals from attacks. The offensive part of the attacker mindset
is also oppositional and dogged.
Defensive security, however, uses a reactive approach that
focuses on prevention and detection of attacks. The defensive mode
of your AMs will allow you to be reactive, helping you see ways
in which you might be caught and hopefully circumventing those
defenses with the help of your offensive prowess. Afterward, your
defensive AMs will allow you to see ways to prevent attacks, mak-
ing you extremely valuable to any client.
