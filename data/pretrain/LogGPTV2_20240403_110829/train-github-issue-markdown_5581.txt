### What do you see as an issue?
Currently, in the Airflow documentation of Tableau connector, it is marked as
deprecated to use a token to authenticate to Tableau.  
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-
tableau/stable/connections/tableau.html#authenticating-to-tableau
However, since MFA enforcement release (27th April 2023), it is now impossible
to use a user/password to authenticate as a service account.
### Solving the problem
Put the deprecated (even remove?) flag on the user/password authentication,
and mark the access token authentication as strongly recommended.
