(8,000 proxies) using other than basic authentication (such as
digest or NTLM). These proxies reported with a total of 2,705
unique realms, the ten most common ones being shared by
85 % of proxies, as shown in Table VIII. The most common
realm “Private port. Please go away and have a nice day”3
related to a Network Functions Virtualization platform was
used by 28 % of the proxies, followed by Squid’s default realm
(“Squid proxy-caching web server”, 16 %) and “Proxy Auth”
(of unknown origin, 13 %). 62 % (~420,000) of all proxies
were located in the USA, followed by Zambia with 72,000
proxies, while the rest were spread out all around the world.
The top four AS consisted of 40 % of all proxies and had
each over 50,000 proxy instances running seems to indicate
that these are probably hosted by service providers. Table VII
shows the distribution of proxies among continents per port.
a) Proxy Implementations: We also analyzed Server
headers from these responses (provided by 93 % of all proxy
responses). There were a total of 460 unique server strings, but
by taking only the ﬁrst part (i. e. “squid” from “squid/4.0.20”)
into account, we were left with 113 unique implementations.
The most commonly deployed proxy software on any port was
Squid, totaling up to 96 % of all proxies revealing their identity.
The eleven most popular, uncleaned versions (excluding one
without a version number) were Squid adding up 83 % of
proxies, all running old, unmaintained versions between 3.1.23
and 4.0.20. The most common with 27 % was a two-year-
old Squid 4.0.20, followed by 3.5.12 (released in Nov 2015)
with 15 % and 3.5.27 (Aug 2017) with 12 % of all responses.
Luckily, most of these are too old to be vulnerable to a recently
found unauthenticated code execution ﬂaw [52]. The ﬁrst non-
Squid responses were CCProxy (12th most common, 5,569
proxies) and Zscaler (14th, 4,588). Squid was also the most
common implementation on all our scanned ports, including
about 140,000 installations on non-default ports. Table IX lists
the most common implementations from all tested ports.
3https://github.com/T-NOVA/Squid-dashboard/blob/master/squid/squid.conf
b) SOCKS Proxies: For SOCKS, we saw replies from
almost 32,000 SOCKS4 and ~20,000 SOCKS5 proxies (from
almost ﬁve million SYN-responsive hosts), totaling to ~34,000
(50 % supporting both versions) unique proxies.
2) Open Proxies: From all the scanned ports and out of
almost 690,000 proxies, just under 3 % (~20,000) were open
proxies. The most popular port for open proxies in absolute
numbers was surprisingly not Squid’s 3128 (which came sec-
ond with 5,100 proxies), but the generic port 8080 with 8,600
open proxies (4.8 % from all on that port). While 71 % (11,869)
of all open HTTP proxies supported the CONNECT command
for HTTPS connections, more importantly, 53 % supported it
also on non-HTTPS ports. In contrast to all proxies, the most
open proxies (totaling to 23 %) were located in China, followed
by the USA (17 %), Brazil (5 %), and Russia (4 %). Proxies
from these four countries add up to over 50 % of all open
proxies. We refer to Table VII for details on geographical
location and openness of proxies among continents. A notable
detail is that although the number of proxies is much lower
in Asia and South America, the proxies in these continents
were more likely to be open than the ones in Europe or North
America. The likelyhood of being an open proxy was much
higher for the privoxy port 8118 than for the rest of the ports.
a) Open SOCKS Proxies: Out of 34,216 SOCKS prox-
ies, 6 % were open proxies, 38 % supporting both SOCKS
versions. On SOCKS-speciﬁc features, 47 % of open SOCKS4
and 76 % of open SOCKS5 proxies supported the DNS ex-
tension. Furthermore, 9 % of SOCKS5 proxies were IPv6
enabled, and 10 % allowed successful UDP relaying. During
our investigation, our identd server observed merely 543 ident
requests, surprisingly only from 28 addresses for the SOCKS
port 1080. Most of the request came for ports 8080 (260), 8888
(163), and 3128 (88), which indicates that these were likely
caused by our crawling activities.
3) Vulnerable Proxies: When ignoring the large Privoxy
population we are going to discuss later in Section IV-D6
and the proxies allowing CONNECT only on port 443, we
