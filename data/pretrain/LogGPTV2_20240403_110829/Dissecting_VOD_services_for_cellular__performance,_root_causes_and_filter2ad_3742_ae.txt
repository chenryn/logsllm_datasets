Across the 14 network profiles the median of average bitrate im-
provements is 10.22%. For the 3 profiles with the lowest average
bandwidth, the duration for which the lowest track is played re-
duces by more than 43.4% compared with the case of considering
only the declared bitrate for track selection. Meanwhile, for all
profiles we observe the stall duration stays the same, except for
one profile, where it increases marginally from 10 s to 12 s. Note
Figure 14: H3 encounters a stall soon after starting to play.
that the above results just illustrates the potential of using fine-
grained segment size information. The development of superior
HAS adaptation schemes for VBR to make better tradeoff between
video quality and stalls is a separate research topic in itself.
In summary, we suggest the services should expose actual segment
bitrate information to the adaptation logic, and that the adaptation
logic should utilize such information to improve track selection.
4.3 Improving Startup Logic
We find that some apps such as H3 always have stalls at the begin-
ning of playback with certain network bandwidth profiles, while
other apps do not have stalls under the same network condition.
This indicates potential problems with the startup logic. As shown
in Figure 14, H3 first selects the track with a bitrate around 1 Mbps,
which is higher than the available network bandwidth . It starts
playback after downloading the first segment. For the second seg-
ment it keeps selecting the same track as it may not yet have built
up enough information about the actual network condition. As the
network bandwidth is lower than selected bitrate, the buffer goes
empty before the second segment is downloaded, leading to a stall.
The investigation into the design difference between apps with
and without QoE problems can give us hints on potential causes and
solutions. We find H3 and H2 set similar startup buffer durations.
However, H2 does not encounter stalls with the same network,
while H3 does. Further analysis shows that each segment of H2 is
only 2 s long and it downloads 4 segments before starting playback,
while the segment duration for H3 is 9 s and it starts playback once
a single segment is downloaded. Based on this observation, we
hypothesize that the likelihood of having stalls at the beginning of
playback does not only depend on the startup buffer duration in
seconds but also on the number of segments in the buffer. Using
just 1 segment as startup buffer introduces a high possibility to
have stalls at the beginning of playback.
To validate this hypothesis and identify improvements, we char-
acterize the tradeoff brought by startup buffer duration setting
between resulting startup delay and stall likelihood at the begin-
ning of a video session, and propose suggestions for determining
the setting empirically. We instrument ExoPlayer to set different
startup buffer durations and play the Testcard stream, a publicly
available DASH stream [7], with different segment durations. We
also configure the player to use different startup track settings. We

same track, the actual bitrates of segments vary significantly. Recent
studies [19, 21] extract QoE information from statistical reports sent
from the client to servers for certain players. However, this can not
be generalized to other services. Some other works [20, 21, 46, 47]
propose to apply machine learning techniques to get QoE infor-
mation from network features such as delay and throughput, but
it unavoidably introduces errors. A recent work [18] proposes to
get initial loading time and stall time from UI events, but it needs
app-specific instrumentation and does not reveal bitrate informa-
tion. Some other studies[29, 49, 51, 53] examine telephony systems
and live multimedia streaming systems. We study popular mobile
video-on-demand services.
Proposal of novel adaptation algorithms. Many prior
works [27, 31, 33, 37, 39, 50, 52] have investigated the opportunities
for optimizing the rate adaptation algorithms. Jiang et al. [31]
propose an adaptation algorithm that improves fairness between
multiple video streaming applications. Li et al. [33] use a TCP-like
probe approach to select video bitrate. PiStream [52] leverages
physical layer information in LTE network to help predict network
bandwidth and adapt video bitrate. Huang et al. [27] select
video bitrate based on buffer occupancy. These state-of-the-art
algorithms can help improve video streaming performance. In
this paper we investigate the algorithms deployed in commercial
mobile VOD systems in practice.
Diagnosis of QoE issues in video streaming systems. Prior ef-
forts [23–26, 30, 32, 38, 42–44]have also emphasized the importance
and challenges of diagnosing the performance problems of video
streaming. Jiang et al. [30] propose to use clustering method over
client attribute to identify root cause to video problems. A recent
work [22] builds a machine learning model to perform root cause
analysis for poor video QoE based on network characteristics. These
works focus on identifying problems caused by external environ-
ment such as poor network condition. We focus on characterizing
the QoE impact of the service design.
6 CONCLUSION
We conduct a detailed measurement study of a wide cross-section
of 12 popular mobile streaming VOD services to develop a holistic
understanding of their design and performance. Using carefully
crafted measurements, we tease out important component designs
across the end-end pipeline, including track settings, startup be-
havior, track switching behavior etc., and identify a number of
QoE issues and their underlying causes. Using what-if-analysis,
we develop best practice solutions to mitigate these challenges.
By extending the understanding of how elements of service de-
sign impact QoE, our findings can help developers better navigate
the design space and build mobile HAS services with improved
performance.

calculate the average startup delay and the stall ratio, i.e. ratio of
runs with stalls, with 50 bandwidth profiles of 1 min generated
by dividing the lowest 5 10-min bandwidth profiles. As shown in
Figure 15, we have the following observations.
• The stall ratio depends on both the startup buffer duration and
the segment duration. With the same startup buffer duration of
8 s, the stall ratio with segments of 4 s is only 57.7% of the ratio
with segments of 8 s.
• Compared with using 1 segment as startup buffer, using 2 or 3
segments significantly reduces the stall possibility. In all video
settings, the stall ratio for using 3 segments is less than 41.7% of
the stall ratio for 1 segment.
• Using a higher bitrate track as startup track can significantly
increase stall possibility, especially when startup buffer is only
1 segment. With the startup buffer duration set to be 4s, when
increasing the startup track bitrate from 0.5Mpbs to 1Mbps, the
stall ratio increases from 60.0% to 91.1%.
Our findings suggest that apps should set the startup buffer duration
to 2 to 3 segments. We check the implementation of ExoPlayer. The
startup buffer duration is a static value in seconds which developers
can configure. We suggest the player should enforce the startup buffer
threshold both in terms of duration and segment count. The startup
track bitrate should also be relatively low to avoid stalls. Similar
suggestions can be also applied to the logic when the player recovers
from stall events.
5 RELATED WORK
QoE characterization of commercial video streaming sys-
tems. Some existing works make effort to characterize streaming
QoE of video services. However, none of existing methodologies
can be generally applied to the mobile VOD services we study. Some
studies [28, 31] extract bitrate information from the request URL
based on certain URL patterns. However, the URL pattern differs
between services and many services even do not have such patterns.
For example, we find that Netflix and Amazon do not directly put
bitrate information in the URL. Akhshabi et al. [17] estimate the
segment duration based on their sizes. However, we find that many
video services use variable bitrate (VBR) encoding. Even for the
