When trying to open a link via `shell.openExternal('https://www.google.com')`
it causes Atom to freeze in case the default browser is Chromium (`chromium-
browser`).
After getting the prompt that Atom has freezed and hitting the kill button I
get the following dump on my console on which I've invoked Atom
    [9784:0416/151609:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox! See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment for more information on developing with the sandbox on.
    App load time: 224ms
    ...
    The setuid sandbox is not running as root. Common causes:
      * An unprivileged process using ptrace on it, like a debugger.
      * A parent process set prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, ...)
    Failed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported, Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted
    The program 'atom' received an X Window System error.
    This probably reflects a bug in the program.
    The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
      (Details: serial 789 error_code 3 request_code 40 minor_code 0)
      (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
       that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
       To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
       option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
       backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
I'm running Xubuntu 14.10 (64bit) with the latest Chromium installed available
via apt-get and Atom 0.192.0
