When attempting to open a link using `shell.openExternal('https://www.google.com')`, Atom freezes if the default browser is Chromium (`chromium-browser`). After receiving a prompt that Atom has frozen and clicking the "Kill" button, the following error dump appears in the console where I launched Atom:

```
[9784:0416/151609:ERROR:browser_main_loop.cc(170)] Running without the SUID sandbox! See https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/LinuxSUIDSandboxDevelopment for more information on developing with the sandbox on.
App load time: 224ms
...
The setuid sandbox is not running as root. Common causes:
  * An unprivileged process using ptrace on it, like a debugger.
  * A parent process set prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, ...)
Failed to move to new namespace: PID namespaces supported, Network namespace supported, but failed: errno = Operation not permitted
The program 'atom' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 789 error_code 3 request_code 40 minor_code 0)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
   option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
```

I am currently using Xubuntu 14.10 (64-bit) with the latest version of Chromium installed via `apt-get` and Atom 0.192.0.
