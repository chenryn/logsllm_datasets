The ReactTransistionGroup assumes that children should be prepended to their
siblings when inserted into the parent. I think we should add an optional prop
that allows configuration to prepend or append children. I have working code I
can submit a pull request I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing
something.
    childrenToRender.push(React.cloneElement(
      this.props.childFactory(child),
      {ref: key, key: key}
    ));
