### Disclosing Security Vulnerabilities: A Complex Issue

Is it necessary to disclose all security vulnerabilities? Likely not. Oracle's internal metrics indicate that, across all product families, over 90% of security vulnerabilities are identified internally, a percentage that has increased since the company began tracking these metrics.

Furthermore, as more vendors adopt a bundling strategy for security patches—releasing them on a regular schedule (monthly, quarterly, or otherwise)—the number of vulnerabilities in each bundle becomes less significant. The primary goal is to address multiple critical security issues in a single patch rather than piecemeal.

While knowing the number of security issues fixed in a patch may raise customer concerns, it is not always possible to draw meaningful conclusions about a product's security-worthiness from this information alone. Without knowing how many issues were fixed but not publicly disclosed, or whether the trend of "new vulnerabilities introduced" versus "old vulnerabilities found and fixed" is positive, it remains challenging to make accurate inferences. This is akin to estimating the size of an iceberg based solely on the portion above water; with icebergs, we have specific gravity data, but with vulnerabilities, there is no way to estimate what lies beneath.

### The Limitations of Using Published Security Vulnerabilities as a Metric

Using the "number of published security vulnerabilities" as a quality metric or for security comparisons is problematic because it is both gameable and invites gaming. If a vendor believes that the number of published vulnerabilities will be used against them competitively, they may be incentivized to underreport significant vulnerabilities to present a better public image. It is important to note that no vendor publicly reports every issue they fix, often due to practical limitations, such as the inability to fix all issues in older versions. However, creating positive incentives to protect customers, rather than reasons to game the system, is in the best interest of the industry.

In a competitive market, businesses seek any advantage they can, including security-worthiness. However, the number of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities is not an objectively fair or competitive metric.

### Harnessing Internal Competitive Metrics

The potential downsides of using external (public) security metrics competitively can be mitigated by leveraging internal competitive metrics. Peer pressure within an organization can drive improvements in security practices. For example, Oracle has made several significant acquisitions in recent years. As part of post-acquisition integration, development organizations from acquired companies are aligned with Oracle's secure development practices. One challenge is that different acquired entities are at varying stages of secure development practice, both in terms of their starting point and their alignment with Oracle Software Security Assurance (OSSA).

To address these disparities, Oracle has implemented a more structured governance program around software assurance. The primary purpose of the collected metrics is to measure the adoption and degree of OSSA practices across the organization. These metrics are reported to the Oracle Security Oversight Committee (OSOC) and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The secondary purpose is to identify and assist organizations that are slow in adopting standard Oracle secure development practices. Resources from Oracle Global Product Security (GPS) are concentrated on these "slow learners" or "late adopters," which may include product assessments, accelerated use of automated tools, and other fast-tracked OSSA requirements.

### Security Compliance Scorecard

The security compliance scorecard is a tool used to track the adoption of OSSA practices. It includes various elements such as secure coding practices training, product security checklists, and participation in critical patch updates. The scorecard is designed to evolve over time as the state of the art in software assurance improves. For example, the use of automated tools, which is one of the most effective and cost-efficient ways to eliminate preventable defects, is a key compliance area. Over time, new tools may be adopted, and compliance will include their use.

One of the benefits of the scorecard is its "shaming effect" on groups with OSSA adoption issues. For instance, the mandatory online class on Oracle Secure Coding Standards (OSCS) saw a rapid increase in completion rates when a bar chart was created to show the percentage completion for each organization. The chart highlighted the "worst offenders" and spurred immediate action to improve compliance rates.

### Anticipating Greater Customer Interest and Regulation

A third reason for a governance structure is to anticipate greater customer interest in secure development practices and a potential requirement for transparency, possibly driven by regulation. Anecdotally, more RFPs are requesting information on secure development practices. Being able to track and report on these practices by development group enables more transparent and accurate RFP responses. In at least one case, increased customer concern about a particular product's security led to a concerted effort to enhance OSSA activities, which would not have been possible without the baseline reporting provided by the security compliance scorecard.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the number of publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities is not a reliable metric for assessing security-worthiness, internal competitive metrics and structured governance programs can drive significant improvements in secure development practices. Oracle's approach, which includes a security compliance scorecard and targeted assistance for slow adopters, demonstrates a commitment to continuous improvement and transparency.
