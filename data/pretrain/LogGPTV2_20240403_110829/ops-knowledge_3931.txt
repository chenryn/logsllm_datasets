User: I have just started with Python. When I execute a python script file on Windows, the output window appears but instantaneously goes away. I need it to stay there so I can analyze my output. How can I keep it open?
Assistant: You can launch python with the -i option or set the environment variable PYTHONINSPECT=x. From the docs:

inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x

So when your script crashes or finishes, you'll get a python prompt and your window will not close.
