User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题partition turned read only after mysql crash I am not able to write on a particular partition. The mysql data directory is hosted on that partition and it suddenly became read-only when mysql crashed on a query.

[root@ESERVER new_dir]# &gt; /data/test.txt
-bash: /data/test.txt: Read-only file system

[root@ESERVER ~]# tail -f /var/log/messages

Is is possible that a partition may become read-only due to heavy query?

Assistant: The issue is certainly the reverse.

The IO error Buffer I/O error on device sdb3, logical block 422576160 will have caused the file system to be mounted read-only. You will likely see this in /var/log/messages further down.

This is very likely to be due to a degraded disk or a firmware bug.
