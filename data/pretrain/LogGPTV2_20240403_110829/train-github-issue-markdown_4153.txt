    If a program has unused variables, then 6g produces a compile error. It would be nicer
    as a compile warning instead. Often I'm commenting out a piece of code during debugging
    which can change a variable from used to unused, meaning I have to temporarily get rid
    of the variable which is a nuisance.
    e.g.
    package main
    func main() {
        var n int
    }
    produces
    test.go:4: n declared and not used
    and no object file
    Preferred: same warning, but also an object file
