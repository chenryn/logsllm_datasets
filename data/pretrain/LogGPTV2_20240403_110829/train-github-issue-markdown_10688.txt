(Original issue below the line)
As suggested below, it makes sense to make `texcache` private, which need to
go through a deprecation cycle. See
https://matplotlib.org/stable/devel/contributing.html#api-changes for a more
detailed description of what is required in terms of deprecating something.
Also, see the helper function `deprecate_privatize_attribute` and how it is
used in the code base.
Marking as good first issue since there is a minor, well-defined, change. But
it may require a bit of reading up to get it right.

### Documentation Link
https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/texmanager_api.html
### Problem
texcache = '/home/elliott/.cache/matplotlib/tex.cache'
### Suggested improvement
Not a big deal, but maybe one can at least add a doc-string stating that is
points to `$HOME/.cache/matplotlib/tex.cache` or however it is actually
determined.
