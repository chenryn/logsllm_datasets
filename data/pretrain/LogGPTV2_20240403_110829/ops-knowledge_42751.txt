User: I'm trying to deploy a new version of my Python/Django application using eb deploy.
It unfortunately fails due to unexpected version of the application. The problem is that somehow eb deploy screwed up the version and I don't know how to override it. The application I upload is working fine, only the version number is not correct, hence, Elastic Beanstalk marks it as Degraded. 
When executing eb deploy, I get this error:

"Incorrect application version "app-cca6-160820_155843" (deployment
  161). Expected version "app-598b-160820_152351" (deployment 159). "

The same says in the health status at AWS Console.
So, my question is the following: How can I force Elastic Beanstalk to make the uploaded application version the current one so it doesn't complain?
Assistant: I've realised that the problem was that Elastic Beanstalk, for some reasons, kept the unsuccessfully deployed versions under .elasticbeanstalk. The solution, at least in my case, was to remove those temporal (or whatever you call them) versions of the application.
