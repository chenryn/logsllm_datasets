## Monitoring Common Security Features

### Display Real-Time Information from Device to Host

**Summary:**
This section describes how to display real-time monitoring information about each device between the device and a destination host.

**Command:**
```bash
user@host> traceroute monitor host
```

**Options:**
- `host`: Sends traceroute packets to the specified hostname or IP address.
- `count number` (Optional): Limits the number of ping requests.
- `inet` (Optional): Forces the traceroute packets to an IPv4 destination.
- `inet6` (Optional): Forces the traceroute packets to an IPv6 destination.
- `interval seconds` (Optional): Sets the interval between ping requests.
- `no-resolve` (Optional): Suppresses the display of hostnames.
- `size bytes` (Optional): Sets the size of the ping request packet.
- `source address` (Optional): Uses the specified source address.
- `summary` (Optional): Displays the summary traceroute information.

**Example Output:**
```bash
user@host> traceroute monitor host2
My traceroute [v0.69]

### Display Multicast Path Information

**Summary:**
This section describes how to display information about a multicast path from a source to the device.

**Command:**
```bash
user@host> mtrace from-source source host
```

**Options:**
- `source host`: Traces the path to the specified hostname or IP address.
- `extra-hops number` (Optional): Sets the number of extra hops.
- `group address` (Optional): Traces the path for the specified group address.
- `interval seconds` (Optional): Sets the interval between statistics gathering.
- `max-hops number` (Optional): Sets the maximum number of hops.
- `max-queries number` (Optional): Sets the maximum number of query attempts.
- `response host` (Optional): Sends the response packets to the specified hostname or IP address.
- `routing-instance routing-instance-name` (Optional): Traces the specified routing instance.
- `ttl number` (Optional): Sets the TTL value.
- `wait-time seconds` (Optional): Sets the time to wait for a response packet.
- `loop` (Optional): Loops indefinitely.
- `multicast-response` (Optional): Forces the responses to use multicast.
- `unicast-response` (Optional): Forces the response packets to use unicast.
- `no-resolve` (Optional): Does not display hostnames.
- `no-router-alert` (Optional): Does not use the router alert IP option.
- `brief` (Optional): Does not display packet rates and losses.
- `detail` (Optional): Displays packet rates and losses.

**Example Output:**
```bash
user@host> mtrace from-source source 192.1.4.1 group 224.1.1.1
Mtrace from 192.1.4.1 to 192.1.30.2 via group 224.1.1.1 Querying full reverse path... * *

### Monitor Security Policies

**Summary:**
This section describes how to monitor security policies and record permitted or denied traffic.

**Action:**
- **Count**: Configurable in an individual policy. Collects statistics for sessions that enter the device for a given policy and for the number of packets and bytes that pass through the device in both directions.
- **Log**: Logging capability can be enabled with security policies during session initialization (`session-init`) or session close (`session-close`).

**Note:**
- Enabling `log` on `session-init` logs denied connections.
- Enabling `log` on `session-close` logs sessions after their conclusion/tear-down.
- Enabling both `session-init` and `session-close` degrades performance compared to enabling `session-init` only.

### Monitor Interfaces and Switching Functions

**Summary:**
This section describes how to monitor interfaces and switching functions.

**Command:**
```bash
user@host> monitor interface (interface-name | traffic)
```

**Options:**
- `interface-name`: Name of a physical or logical interface.
- `traffic`: Displays statistics for all active interfaces.

**Output Control Keys:**
- `c`: Clears delta counters.
- `f`: Freezes the display.
- `i`: Displays information about a different interface.
- `n`: Displays information about the next interface.
- `q` or `ESC`: Quits the command.
- `t`: Thaws the display.

**Example Output:**
```bash
user@host> monitor interface fe-0/0/0
host1 Seconds: 5 Time: 04:38:40
Delay: 3/0/10
Interface: fe-0/0/0, Enabled, Link is Up

Input bytes: 885405423 (3248 bps) [2631]
Output bytes: 137411893 (3344 bps) [10243]

Output packets: 636071 (1 pps) [23]
