### Packet Forwarding and Routing

- **Packet Forwarding**: The process of forwarding a packet based on the contents of the routing table.
- **Route Determination Process**: The process of selecting the appropriate route from the routing table for forwarding a packet.
- **Route Cache**: A table where IPv4 stores the next-hop IPv4 addresses and interfaces for recently determined destination IPv4 addresses.
- **Router**: A TCP/IP node that can forward packets not addressed to itself (also known as a gateway in IPv4).
- **Routing Table**: A set of routes used to determine the next-hop address and interface for IPv6 traffic sent by a host or forwarded by a router.

#### Abstract
This chapter provides an overview of the Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) over TCP/IP and its implementation in Microsoft Windows. Although not essential for environments using Active Directory, NetBIOS over TCP/IP is still utilized by certain applications included with Windows. Understanding NetBIOS names and their resolution is crucial for network administrators to troubleshoot related issues.

#### NetBIOS over TCP/IP Overview
NetBIOS was developed in the early 1980s to facilitate application communication over a network. It defines:
- **Session Layer Programming Interface**: A standard API at the Session layer of the OSI model, allowing applications to utilize the services of installed network protocol stacks.
- **Session Management and Data Transport Protocol**: A protocol functioning at the Session and Transport layers, providing commands and support for:
  - Network name registration and verification.
  - Session establishment and termination.
  - Reliable connection-oriented session data transfer.
  - Unreliable connectionless datagram data transfer.
  - Protocol and adapter monitoring and management.

**NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT)** sends the NetBIOS protocol over TCP or UDP:
- **NetBIOS session traffic**: TCP port 139
- **NetBIOS name management traffic**: UDP port 137
- **NetBIOS datagram traffic**: UDP port 138

**Figure 11-1** shows the architecture of NetBT components in the TCP/IP protocol suite.

RFCs 1001 and 1002 define NetBIOS operation over IPv4. NetBT is not defined for IPv6. NetBIOS over TCP/IP is sometimes referred to as NBT.

#### Enabling NetBIOS over TCP/IP
To enable NetBT on Windows, follow these steps:
1. Open Network Connections.
2. Right-click a connection and select the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) component.
3. Click Properties, then Advanced, and finally the WINS tab.
4. Choose the appropriate option in the NetBIOS setting.

**Figure 11-2** shows the WINS tab for the Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) component.

**NetBIOS Setting Options**:
- **Default**: Enables NetBT if the network connection has a static IPv4 address configuration. If using DHCP, it uses the DHCP options in the DHCPOffer message to either disable or enable and configure NetBT. To disable NetBT using DHCP, set the Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) Microsoft vendor-specific option to 2. This is the default setting for LAN connections.
- **Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP**: Enables NetBT, regardless of the DHCP options received. This is the default setting for remote connections (dial-up or virtual private network).
- **Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP**: Disables NetBT, regardless of the DHCP options received.

NetBT is not required for Windows unless using NetBIOS applications, such as the Computer Browser service, which maintains the list of computers in the Network window and the Microsoft Windows Network window of My Network Places. File and printer sharing in Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2003 can operate without NetBT.

#### NetBIOS Names
A NetBIOS name is 16 bytes long and identifies a NetBIOS resource on the network. It can be unique (exclusive) or group (non-exclusive). Unique names are used for specific processes, while group names are used for multiple computers.

The File and Printer Sharing over Microsoft Networks component (Server service) registers a unique NetBIOS name based on the computer name. The exact NetBIOS name is the 15-byte computer name plus a sixteenth byte of 0x20. Other services that use NetBIOS include the Client for Microsoft Networks component (Workstation service) and the Messenger service.

**Figure 11-3** shows the use of NetBIOS names in the NetBT architecture.

#### Common NetBIOS Names
| Registered Name | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `ComputerName0x00` | Name registered for the Workstation service. |
| `ComputerName0x03` | Name registered for the Messenger service. |
| `ComputerName0x20` | Name registered for the Server service. |
| `UserName0x03` | Name of the user currently logged on, registered by the Messenger service. |
| `DomainName0x1B` | Domain name registered by a domain controller running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2003. |

#### NetBIOS Name Registration, Resolution, and Release
All NetBT nodes manage NetBIOS names through processes for name registration, name resolution, and name release.

- **Name Registration**: When a NetBT host initializes, it registers its NetBIOS names using a NetBIOS Name Registration Request message. If a unique name is already registered, the host receives a negative response and typically displays an error message.
- **Name Resolution**: NetBIOS applications broadcast a NetBIOS Name Query Request message on the local network or send a unicast message to an NBNS. The responding host or NBNS sends a positive or negative NetBIOS Name Query Response message.
- **Name Release**: When a NetBIOS application stops, the host requests the NBNS to no longer respond to queries for the name and stops sending negative name registration responses.

#### Segmenting NetBIOS Names with the NetBIOS Scope ID
The NetBIOS scope ID is a character string appended to the NetBIOS name, isolating a set of NetBT nodes. Without scopes, a unique NetBIOS name must be unique across all resources. With scopes, it only needs to be unique within a specific scope.

**Figure 11-4** shows an example organization using two NetBIOS scopesâ€”APPS and MIS.

**Configuring a NetBIOS Scope ID**:
- Through the DHCP NetBIOS Scope ID option (option 47) for DHCP clients.
- By configuring the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netbt\ScopeID` registry value on the local computer.

#### NetBIOS Name Resolution
NetBIOS name resolution maps a NetBIOS name to an IPv4 address. Methods include:

- **NetBIOS Name Cache**: A local table in RAM containing recently resolved NetBIOS names and their corresponding IPv4 addresses.
- **NBNS (WINS)**: A server that complies with RFC 1001 and 1002, providing name resolution of NetBIOS names.
- **Local Broadcast**: NetBIOS Name Query Request messages broadcast on the local subnet.
- **Lmhosts File**: A local text file mapping NetBIOS names to IPv4 addresses for applications on remote subnets.
- **Local Host Name**: The configured host name for the computer.
- **DNS Resolver Cache**: A local RAM-based table containing domain name and IP address mappings.
- **DNS Servers**: Servers maintaining databases of IP address-to-host name mappings.

#### Resolving Local NetBIOS Names Using a Broadcast
- **Step 1**: NetBT checks the NetBIOS name cache for the IPv4 address. If found, no broadcast is sent.
- **Step 2**: If not found, the host broadcasts up to three NetBIOS Name Query Request messages on the local subnet.
- **Step 3**: Each neighboring host checks its local NetBIOS table to see if it has registered the requested name.
- **Step 4**: The host that has registered the queried name sends a positive NetBIOS Name Query Response message.

**Limitations of Broadcasts**:
Routers do not forward broadcasts, confining them to the local subnet.
