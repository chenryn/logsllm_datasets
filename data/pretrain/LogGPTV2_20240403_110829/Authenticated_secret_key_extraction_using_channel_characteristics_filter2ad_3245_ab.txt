pacity messages and got capacity messages from others, each
sensor performs classiﬁcation on the collected ARVs result-
ing in two groups with diﬀerent ARV mean values, adds
the sensors whose ARV values are in the group with smaller
ARV mean into the trusted group. The nodes in the trusted
groups are believed to be authenticated. The capacity mes-
sages of trusted neighbors will be processed to ﬁnd the nodes
that are trusted by these neighbors, which are added into the
trusted group if they were not there. This process is recur-
sively executed until all the nodes with a trust path to the
node are added to the trusted group. At the end of this
phase, each node has the knowledge of all the channel secret
capacity information as well as the set of trusted neighbors.
(4) Deciding Maximum Entropy: Having got the capacity
topology, we would like to know the maximum size of secret
key that can be delivered from each sensor to CU based on
the channels with diﬀerent secret capacities. In the above
authentication process, some on-body sensors are directly
accepted by CU, whose channels to CU are stable with a
low-entropy key between each of them and CU. Even if the
sensor is authenticated by multi-hop authentication, it can-
not guarantee that the direct unstable channel between itself
and CU has a high entropy. The task is thus to ﬁnd out the
maximum secret key that can be obtained between a sensor
and CU given the capacity topology. This becomes a gener-
alization of single-source single-sink maximum-ﬂow problem.
Therefore, we can let each sensor node run the maximum-
ﬂow algorithm on the topology to ﬁnd the path(s) through
which the entropy of the key information transmitted from
itself to CU can be maximized.
(5) Key Aggregation Broadcast: After having found the
max-ﬂow path(s) between a source sensor node and the des-
tination node CU, it remains to let the BAN nodes along the
path(s) securely exchange their derived secret keys to help
the sensor node and CU extract a shared maximum secret
key. For this purpose, we let each of the remaining sensors on
the path, except the source sensor and the destination node
CU, broadcast the XORed value of the keys shared with its
pre-hop and next-hop sensors in turn. For example, in Fig.2,
if there is a max-ﬂow path 3-2-5-CU between node 3 and the
CU, the intermediate nodes 2 and 5 shall broadcast k23⊕k25
and k25 ⊕ k5CU respectively. Node 3 and the CU can derive
both k23 ⊕ k5CU based on the broadcast messages and their
respectively secret keys, and choose either k23 or k5CU as the
1029ﬁnal key for this path. During the broadcast process, when
the source sensor and the CU receive such key aggregation
messages, they will refer to the trust table stored in their
memory.
If the sender of the broadcast message is in the
trust table, they accept content of the message. Based on
the information obtained from all the broadcast messages it
accepts, with the key possessed by itself, this sensor gets all
the shared keys along the path(s) by XOR operations if all
the nodes on the path(s) are trusted. The ﬁnal secret key
shared with the CU is the concatenation of the shared keys
from individual max-ﬂow paths.
4. EXPERIMENT EVALUATION
4.1 Experimental Setup
Our experiments were conducted on Crossbow TelosB motes
(TRP2400) which are all equipped with IEEE 802.15.4 ra-
dio. We used 10 TelosB motes in most experiments: 8 as
on-body sensors, which are randomly placed on the body
surface, one as the CU and one as the oﬀ-body attacker.
We also varied the ratio of number of on-body sensors to
that of oﬀ-body attackers. For device authentication, we
mainly emphasize on studying the eﬀectiveness diﬀerentiat-
ing on-body motes from oﬀ-body nodes with our multi-hop
authentication method.
Similar to BANA, our experiments were conducted in three
locations - a small room, a medium size room and the rela-
tively large corridor in the university building. We studied
three movements - walking, sitting-and-rotating, and sitting-
and-rolling. The experiments were conducted on three indi-
viduals including males and female. Diﬀerent from BANA,
in our experiments we have relatively relaxed requirements
on the movements. For example, for the walking movement,
subjects can walk freely instead of walking slowly.

4.2 Node Authentication
For node authentication alone, we conducted 17 experi-
ments with the random combination of the following factors
- location of experiment, movement, mote placement and
subject. As shown in Table.3, we can see that the over-
all false positive rate in ASK-BAN is almost 14 times less
than that of BANA, reducing from 40.44% to 2.94%. Such
a dramatic diﬀerence can mainly be explained by the free
conﬁguration in the experiments.
In our 17 experiments,
the false negative rate under diﬀerent on-body to oﬀ-body
node ratios remains 0 which is the same as BANA.
4.3 Authenticated Secret Key Extraction
In our experiments, we conducted three tests in the small
room and the corridor respectively to validate the eﬀective-
ness of ASK-BAN in terms of secret key extraction rate.
From our experiments with the 8 on-body sensors, we found
Figure 4: Comparison of secret key rate of ASK-
BAN and other solutions.
that ASK-BAN is able to generate an average secret key rate
of 7.29bps in the corridor if t = 6ms for each node. For the
small room-5ms, the rate is about 8.03bps. That for small
room-6ms setting is about 8.03bps. On the other hand, if
we utilize the direct channel to the CU for each node to ex-
tract the secret key, the average bit rates are about 1.04bps,
0.90pbs, and 0.94pbs for corridor-6ms, small room-6ms, and
small room-5ms settings respectively. This means that ASK-
BAN boosts the secret bit rate for about 8 times than that
using direct channel to CU.
As comparison, we also applied the one-hop relay method
suggested by Lai et al.[3]. As the results shown in Fig.4, it is
easy to see that ASK-BAN is about 2 to 4 times faster than
the one-hop relay method. Moreover, existing work on pair-
wise secret key extraction on BAN would have comparable
key rate to ASK-BAN. For example, Ali et al. [1] achieved a
secret bit rate up to 10.18bps for a single pair of BAN nodes
based on RSS measurements. However, this solution does
not provide node authentication at the same time.
5. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, for the ﬁrst time we propose a lightweight au-
thenticated secret key extraction protocol for BAN merely
based on wireless channel measurement. By utilizing ob-
served channel property, we solved the self-contradictory re-
quirements for node authentication and fast secret key ex-
traction. Our proposed multi-hop authentication method
can signiﬁcantly reduce the false positive rate than an exist-
ing work BANA. To boost the secret key generation rate, we
designed a novel collaborative secret key extraction solution
based on max-ﬂow algorithm.
