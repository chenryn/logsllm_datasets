## Abstract

Modern automobiles are extensively computerized, making them potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks. Previous research has shown that the internal networks of some modern cars are insecure, but the associated threat model, which requires prior physical access, has been considered unrealistic. This paper aims to address the question of whether automobiles can be susceptible to remote compromise by systematically analyzing their external attack surface. We discover that remote exploitation is feasible through a wide range of attack vectors, including diagnostic tools, CD players, Bluetooth, and cellular radio. Additionally, wireless communication channels enable long-distance vehicle control, location tracking, in-cabin audio exfiltration, and theft. We also discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive ecosystem that contribute to these vulnerabilities and highlight the practical challenges in mitigating them.

## Introduction

Modern vehicles are controlled by complex distributed computer systems, comprising millions of lines of code executing on multiple heterogeneous processors, interconnected by internal networks such as CAN. While this architecture offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency, safety, and cost, it also introduces new security risks. For example, previous work has demonstrated that an attacker with access to a car's internal network can bypass all computer control systems, including critical safety features like brakes and engine [14].

However, the threat model underlying past research, which assumes an attacker's ability to physically connect to the internal network, has been criticized as unrealistic. It is often pointed out that attackers with physical access can also mount non-computerized attacks, such as cutting brake lines.

This situation highlights a significant gap in knowledge regarding the extent and practicality of external attacks. Our research aims to fill this gap by conducting a systematic and empirical analysis of the remote attack surface of a late-model mass-production sedan. We make four principal contributions:

1. **Threat Model Characterization:** We systematically identify possible external attack vectors based on the attacker's ability to deliver malicious input via indirect physical access, short-range wireless access, and long-range wireless access. We characterize the attack surface exposed in current automobiles and their numerous I/O channels.

2. **Vulnerability Analysis:** For each access vector category, we investigate concrete examples and assess the level of actual exposure. We find practically exploitable vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary automotive control without direct physical access. These include compromising diagnostics equipment used by mechanics, playing a specially modified song in WMA format through the media player, exploiting hands-free Bluetooth functionality, and calling the car's cellular modem to play a crafted audio signal encoding an exploit.

3. **Threat Assessment:** We evaluate the utility of the uncovered vulnerabilities to an attacker, considering how they might leverage a car's external interfaces for post-compromise control. We demonstrate multiple post-compromise control channels, including TPMS wireless signals and FM radio, interactive remote control via the Internet, real-time data exfiltration of position and speed, and surreptitious streaming of cabin audio. We also explore potential attack scenarios and assess whether these threats are purely conceptual or pose real risks.

4. **Synthesis:** We reflect on the similarities among the vulnerabilities we uncovered and argue that many of these security issues arise from systemic structural problems in the automotive ecosystem. We provide concrete, pragmatic recommendations to significantly enhance automotive system security until deeper architectural redesigns can be implemented.

## 2. Background and Related Work

Modern automobiles are controlled by a diverse array of digital components, known as Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which manage various functionalities, including the drivetrain, brakes, lighting, and entertainment. Charette estimates that a modern luxury vehicle includes up to 70 distinct ECUs, with tens of millions of lines of code [5]. These ECUs are interconnected by common wired networks, typically variants of the Controller Area Network (CAN) or FlexRay bus, enabling complex safety and convenience features.

This architecture, however, also provides a broad internal attack surface, as each component on a given bus has at least implicit access to every other component. Several research groups have described how this architecture can be exploited if compromised components are present [15, 24, 26, 27, 28]. Our own group has demonstrated that if an adversary can communicate on one or more of a car’s internal network buses, they can maliciously control critical components across the entire car [14].

Research on the external attack surface of modern vehicles is limited. Notable exceptions include Rouf et al.'s analysis of the wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) [22], which focused on privacy implications and methods for manipulating drivers. Other work has addressed computer security issues related to car theft, such as Francillon et al.'s demonstration of relay attacks against keyless entry systems [9] and attacks on RFID-based protocols used by engine immobilizers [2, 6, 11]. There has also been work on future security issues associated with proposed vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems [4, 13, 21]. To our knowledge, we are the first to comprehensively consider the full external attack surface of contemporary automobiles, characterize the threat models, and experimentally demonstrate the practicality of remote threats, control, and data exfiltration.

## 3. Automotive Threat Models

While previous research has highlighted specific classes of threats to automotive systems, it is crucial to place these threats and defenses in the context of the entire automotive platform. In this section, we aim to provide a comprehensive treatment by characterizing the threat model for a modern automobile. Our threat model is informed by the experimental investigations we conducted, which are described in subsequent sections.

### 3.1 Indirect Physical Access

Modern automobiles provide several physical interfaces that either directly or indirectly access the car’s internal networks. We consider the full physical attack surface under the constraint that the adversary may not directly access these interfaces but must work through an intermediary.

- **OBD-II Port:** The most significant interface is the OBD-II port, federally mandated in the U.S., which provides direct access to the car’s key CAN buses. While our threat model forbids direct access, the OBD-II port is commonly accessed by service personnel during routine maintenance. If an adversary can compromise the systems at the dealership, they could amplify this access to attack any cars under service. Such systems are typically internet-connected, making traditional means of personal computer compromise applicable.
- **Entertainment Systems:** Modern vehicles also provide CD players and digital multimedia ports (USB, iPod/iPhone docking ports) for entertainment. An adversary could deliver malicious input by encoding it onto a CD or as a song file and using social engineering to convince the user to play it. Alternatively, they could compromise the user’s phone or iPod and install software that attacks the car’s media system when connected. Many media systems are interconnected with the CAN bus, making a compromised CD player a potential vector for attacking other automotive components.

### 3.2 Short-Range Wireless Access

Indirect physical access has operational complexities, targeting challenges, and limitations in controlling the time of compromise. Here, we consider the attack surface for automotive wireless interfaces that operate over short ranges, including Bluetooth, Remote Keyless Entry (RKE), RFIDs, Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS), WiFi, and Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC). We assume the adversary can place a wireless transmitter in proximity to the car’s receiver (between 5 and 300 meters depending on the channel).

- **Bluetooth:** Bluetooth is the de facto standard for hands-free calling in automobiles and is standard in mainstream vehicles. While the lowest level of the Bluetooth protocol is typically implemented in hardware, the management and services component is often implemented in software. The range of Class 2 devices used in automotive implementations is typically 10 meters, but this can be extended with amplifiers and directional antennas [20].
- **Remote Keyless Entry (RKE):** Most modern vehicles use RF-based RKE systems to remotely open doors, activate alarms, flash lights, and start the ignition. These systems typically use digital signals encoded over 315 MHz in the U.S. and 433 MHz in Europe.
- **Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS):** In the U.S., all 2007 model year and newer cars are required to support TPMS, which monitors tire pressure and sends wireless signals to the ECU.
