Abstract
Modern automobiles are pervasively computerized, and
hence potentially vulnerable to attack. However, while
previous research has shown that the internal networks
within some modern cars are insecure, the associated
threat model — requiring prior physical access — has
justiﬁably been viewed as unrealistic. Thus, it remains an
open question if automobiles can also be susceptible to
remote compromise. Our work seeks to put this question
to rest by systematically analyzing the external attack
surface of a modern automobile. We discover that remote
exploitation is feasible via a broad range of attack vectors
(including mechanics tools, CD players, Bluetooth and
cellular radio), and further, that wireless communications
channels allow long distance vehicle control, location
tracking, in-cabin audio exﬁltration and theft. Finally, we
discuss the structural characteristics of the automotive
ecosystem that give rise to such problems and highlight
the practical challenges in mitigating them.
Introduction
1
Modern cars are controlled by complex distributed com-
puter systems comprising millions of lines of code execut-
ing on tens of heterogeneous processors with rich connec-
tivity provided by internal networks (e.g., CAN). While
this structure has offered signiﬁcant beneﬁts to efﬁciency,
safety and cost, it has also created the opportunity for new
attacks. For example, in previous work we demonstrated
that an attacker connected to a car’s internal network can
circumvent all computer control systems, including safety
critical elements such as the brakes and engine [14].
However,
the threat model underlying past work
(including our own) has been met with signiﬁcant, and
justiﬁable, criticism (e.g., [1, 3, 16]). In particular, it is
widely felt that presupposing an attacker’s ability to physi-
cally connect to a car’s internal computer network may be
unrealistic. Moreover, it is often pointed out that attackers
with physical access can easily mount non-computerized
attacks as well (e.g., cutting the brake lines).
This situation suggests a signiﬁcant gap in knowledge,
and one with considerable practical import. To what ex-
tent are external attacks possible, to what extent are they
practical, and what vectors represent the greatest risks?
Is the etiology of such vulnerabilities the same as for
desktop software and can we think of defense in the same
manner? Our research seeks to ﬁll this knowledge gap
through a systematic and empirical analysis of the remote
attack surface of late model mass-production sedan.
We make four principal contributions:
Threat model characterization. We systematically
synthesize a set of possible external attack vectors as
a function of the attacker’s ability to deliver malicious
input via particular modalities: indirect physical access,
short-range wireless access, and long-range wireless
access. Within each of these categories, we characterize
the attack surface exposed in current automobiles and
their surprisingly large set of I/O channels.
Vulnerability analysis. For each access vector category,
we investigate one or more concrete examples in depth
and assess the level of actual exposure. In each case we
ﬁnd the existence of practically exploitable vulnerabilities
that permit arbitrary automotive control without requiring
direct physical access. Among these, we demonstrate the
ability to compromise a car via vulnerable diagnostics
equipment widely used by mechanics, through the media
player via inadvertent playing of a specially modiﬁed
song in WMA format, via vulnerabilities in hands-free
Bluetooth functionality and, ﬁnally, by calling the car’s
cellular modem and playing a carefully crafted audio
signal encoding both an exploit and a bootstrap loader
for additional remote-control functionality.
Threat assessment. From these uncovered vulnerabili-
ties, we consider the question of “utility” to an attacker:
what capabilities does the vulnerability enable? Unique
to this work, we study how an attacker might leverage a
car’s external interfaces for post-compromise control. We
demonstrate multiple post-compromise control channels
(including TPMS wireless signals and FM radio), inter-
active remote control via the Internet and real-time data
exﬁltration of position, speed and surreptitious streaming
of cabin audio (i.e., anything being said in the vehicle) to
an outside recipient. Finally, we also explore potential at-
tack scenarios and gauge whether these threats are purely
conceptual or whether there are plausible motives that
transform them into actual risks. In particular, we demon-
strate complete capabilities for both theft and surveillance.
Synthesis. On reﬂection, we noted that the vulnera-
bilities we uncovered have surprising similarities. We
believe that these are not mere coincidences, but that
many of these security problems arise, in part, from
systemic structural issues in the automotive ecosystem.
Given these lessons, we make a set of concrete, pragmatic
recommendations which signiﬁcantly raise the bar for
automotive system security. These recommendations are
intended to “bridge the gap” until deeper architectural
redesign can be carried out.
2 Background and Related Work
Modern automobiles are controlled by a heterogeneous
combination of digital components. These components,
Electronic Control Units (ECUs), oversee a broad range
of functionality, including the drivetrain, brakes, lighting,
and entertainment. Indeed, very few operations are not
mediated by computer control in a modern vehicle (with
the parking brake and steering being the last holdouts,
though semi-automatic parallel parking capabilities are
available in some vehicles and full steer-by-wire has been
demonstrated in several concept cars). Charette estimates
that a modern luxury vehicle includes up to 70 distinct
ECUs including tens of millions of lines of code [5]. In
turn, ECUs are interconnected by common wired net-
works, usually a variant of the Controller Area Network
(CAN) [12] or FlexRay bus [8]. This interconnection
permits complex safety and convenience features such as
pre-tensioning of seat-belts when a crash is predicted and
automatically varying radio volume as a function of speed.
At the same time, this architecture provides a broad
internal attack surface since on a given bus each compo-
nent has at least implicit access to every other component.
Indeed, several research groups have described how
this architecture might be exploited in the presence
of compromised components [15, 24, 26, 27, 28] or
demonstrated such exploits by spooﬁng messages to
isolated components in the lab [10]. Most recently,
our own group documented experiments on a complete
automobile, demonstrating that if an adversary were
able to communicate on one or more of a car’s internal
network buses, then this capability could be sufﬁcient
to maliciously control critical components across the
entire car (including dangerous behavior such as forcibly
engaging or disengaging individual brakes independent of
driver input) [14]. However, these results raise the ques-
tion of how an adversary might be able to access a car’s
internal bus (and thus compromise its ECUs) absent direct
physical access, a question that we answer in this paper.
About the latter question — understanding the external
attack surface of modern vehicles — there has been
far less research work. Among the exceptions is Rouf
et al.’s recent analysis of the wireless Tire Pressure
Monitoring System (TPMS) in a modern vehicle [22].
While their work was primarily focused on the privacy
implications of TPMS broadcasts, they also described
methods for manipulating drivers by spooﬁng erroneous
tire pressure readings and, most relevant to our work,
an experience in which they accidentally caused the
ECU managing TPMS data to stop functioning through
wireless signals alone. Still others have focused on the
computer security issues around car theft, including
Francillon et al.’s recent demonstration of relay attacks
against keyless entry systems [9], and the many attacks
on the RFID-based protocols used by engine immobi-
lizers to identify the presence of a valid ignition key,
e.g., [2, 6, 11]. Orthogonally, there has been work that
considers the future security issues (and expanded attack
surface) associated with proposed vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) systems (sometimes also called vehicular ad-hoc
networks, or VANETs) [4, 13, 21]. To the best of our
knowledge, however, we are the ﬁrst to consider the full
external attack surface of the contemporary automobile,
characterize the threat models under which this surface is
exposed, and experimentally demonstrate the practicality
of remote threats, remote control, and remote data
exﬁltration. Our experience further gives us the vantage
point to reﬂect on some of the ecosystem challenges that
give rise to these problems and point the way forward
to better secure the automotive platform in the future.
3 Automotive threat models
While past work has illuminated speciﬁc classes of threats
to automotive systems — such as the technical security
properties of their internal networks [14, 15, 24, 26, 27,
28] — we believe that it is critical for future work to place
speciﬁc threats and defenses in the context of the entire
automotive platform. In this section, we aim to bootstrap
such a comprehensive treatment by characterizing the
threat model for a modern automobile. Though we
present it ﬁrst, our threat model is informed signiﬁcantly
by the experimental investigations we carried out, which
are described in subsequent sections.
In deﬁning our threat model, we distinguish between
technical capabilities and operational capabilities.
Technical capabilities describe our assumptions con-
cerning what the adversary knows about its target vehicles
as well as her ability to analyze these systems to develop
malicious inputs for various I/O channels. For example,
we assume that the adversary has access to an instance of
the automobile model being targeted and has the technical
skill to reverse engineer the appropriate subsystems and
protocols (or is able to purchase such information from
a third-party). Moreover, we assume she is able to obtain
the appropriate hardware or medium to transmit messages
whose encoding is appropriate for any given channel.1
When encountering cryptographic controls, we also
assume that the adversary is computationally bounded
and cannot efﬁciently brute force large shared secrets,
such as large symmetric encryption keys. In general, we
assume that the attacker only has access to information
that can be directly gleaned from examining the systems
of a vehicle similar to the one being targeted.2 We believe
these assumptions are quite minimal and mimic the
access afforded to us when conducting this work.
By contrast, operational capabilities characterize the
adversary’s requirements in delivering a malicious input
to a particular access vector in the ﬁeld. In considering
the full range of I/O capabilities present in a modern
vehicle, we identify the qualitative differences in the
challenges required to access each channel. These in
turn can be roughly classiﬁed into three categories:
indirect physical access, short-range wireless access,
and long-range wireless access. In the remainder of this
section we explore the threat model for each of these
categories and within each we synthesize the “attack
surface” presented by the full range of I/O channels
present in today’s automobiles. Figure 1 highlights where
I/O channels exist on a modern automobile today.
Indirect physical access
3.1
Modern automobiles provide several physical interfaces
that either directly or indirectly access the car’s internal
networks. We consider the full physical attack surface
here, under the constraint that the adversary may not
directly access these physical interfaces herself but must
instead work through some intermediary.
OBD-II. The most signiﬁcant automotive interface is
the OBD-II port, federally mandated in the U.S., which
typically provides direct access to the automobile’s
key CAN buses and can provide sufﬁcient access to
compromise the full range of automotive systems [14].
While our threat model forbids the adversary from direct
access herself, we note that the OBD-II port is commonly
1For the concrete vulnerabilities we will explore, the hardware
cost for such capabilities is modest, requiring only commodity laptop
computers, an audio card, a USB-to-CAN interface, and, in a few
instances, an inexpensive, off-the-shelf USRP software radio platform.
2A question which we do not consider in this work is the extent to
which the attack surface is “portable” between vehicle models from
a given manufacturer. There is signiﬁcant evidence that some such
attacks are portable as manufacturers prefer to build a small number
of underlying platforms that are specialized to deliver model-speciﬁc
features, but we are not in a position to evaluate this question compre-
hensively.

accessed by service personnel during routine maintenance
for both diagnostics and ECU programming.
Historically this access is achieved using dedicated
handheld “scan” tools such as Ford’s NGS, Nissan’s
Consult II and Toyota’s Diagnostic Tester which are
themselves programmed via Windows-based personal
computers. For modern vehicles, most manufacturers
have adopted an approach that is PC-centric. Under this
model, a laptop computer interfaces with a “PassThru”
device (typically directly via USB or WiFi) that in turn
is plugged into the car’s OBD-II port. Software on the
laptop computer can then interrogate or program the car’s
ECUs via this device (typically using the standard SAE
J2534 API). Examples of such tools include Toyota’s
TIS, Ford’s VCM, Nissan’s Consult 3 and Honda’s HDS
among others.
In both situations Windows-based computers directly
or indirectly control the data to be sent to the automobile.
Thus, if an adversary were able to compromise such
systems at the dealership she could amplify this access to
attack any cars under service. Such laptop computers are
typically Internet-connected (indeed, this is a requirement
for some manufacturers’ systems), so traditional means
of personal computer compromise could be employed.
Further aﬁeld, electric vehicles may also communicate
with external chargers via the charging cable. An
adversary able to compromise the external charging
infrastructure may thus be able to leverage that access
to subsequently attack any connected automobile.
Entertainment: Disc, USB and iPod.
The other
important class of physical interfaces are focused on
entertainment systems. Virtually all automobiles shipped
today provide a CD player able to interpret a wide
variety of audio formats (raw “Red Book” audio, MP3,
WMA, and so on). Similarly, vehicle manufacturers also
provide some kind of external digital multimedia port
(typically either a USB port or an iPod/iPhone docking
port) for allowing users to control their car’s media
system using their personal audio player or phone. Some
manufacturers have widened this interface further; BMW
and Mini recently announced their support for “iPod Out,”
a scheme whereby Apple media devices will be able to
control the display on the car’s console.
Consequently, an adversary might deliver malicious
input by encoding it onto a CD or as a song ﬁle and
using social engineering to convince the user to play it.
Alternatively, she might compromise the user’s phone or
iPod out of band and install software onto it that attacks
the car’s media system when connected.
Taking over a CD player alone is a limited threat; but,
for a variety of reasons, automotive media systems are
not standalone devices. Indeed, many such systems are
now CAN bus interconnected, either to directly interface
with other automotive systems (e.g., to support chimes,
certain hands-free features, or to display messages on
the console) or simply to support a common maintenance
path for updating all ECU ﬁrmware. Thus, counterintu-
itively, a compromised CD player can offer an effective
vector for attacking other automotive components.
3.2 Short-range wireless access
Indirect physical access has a range of drawbacks in-
cluding its operational complexity, challenges in precise
targeting, and the inability to control the time of compro-
mise. Here we weaken the operational requirements on
the attacker and consider the attack surface for automotive
wireless interfaces that operate over short ranges. These
include Bluetooth, Remote Keyless Entry, RFIDs, Tire
Pressure Monitoring Systems, WiFi, and Dedicated Short-
Range Communications. For this portion of the attack
surface we assume that the adversary is able to place
a wireless transmitter in proximity to the car’s receiver
(between 5 and 300 meters depending on the channel).
Bluetooth. Bluetooth has become the de facto standard
for supporting hands-free calling in automobiles and
is standard in mainstream vehicles sold by all major
automobile manufacturers. While the lowest level of the
Bluetooth protocol is typically implemented in hardware,
the management and services component of the Bluetooth
stack is often implemented in software. In normal usage,
the Class 2 devices used in automotive implementations
have a range of 10 meters, but others have demonstrated
that this range can be extended through ampliﬁers and
directional antennas [20].
Remote Keyless Entry.
Today, all but entry-level
automobiles shipped in the U.S. use RF-based remote
keyless entry (RKE) systems to remotely open doors,
activate alarms, ﬂash lights and, in some cases, start the
ignition (all typically using digital signals encoded over
315 MHz in the U.S. and 433 MHz in Europe).
Tire pressure.
In the U.S., all 2007 model year and
newer cars are required to support a Tire Pressure Moni-
