User: How to deploy auto-scaling EC2 instances using AWS CLI?
Assistant: To deploy an auto-scaling EC2 instance using the AWS CLI, follow these steps: 1. Install the AWS CLI: If you haven't installed the AWS CLI, the first step is to install it. You can install it through the official documentation of AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html). 2. Create a Launch Configuration: In the AWS EC2 console, click on "Launch Configuration" and then "Create Launch Configuration". Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image), choose the instance type (Instance Type) for the instance, add the appropriate rules for the security group, and create a launch configuration. 3. Create an auto-scaling policy: In the AWS console, create an auto-scaling policy. Define the minimum and maximum number of instances, and the launch configuration to run when autoscaling. 4. Create an Auto Scaling Group: In the AWS EC2 console, create an Auto Scaling Group. Name the group name, select the VPC and subnet, and select the launch configuration and auto-scaling policy you just created. 5. Scaling using the AWS CLI: By using the autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group command of the AWS CLI, you can use the autoscaling group created earlier in the console to scale the instance. For example: ``` aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name my-auto-scaling-group --launch-configuration-name my-launch-config --min-size 2 -- max-size 5 --desired-capacity 2 ``` 6. Check auto-scaling: Through the AWS EC2 console, create an auto-scaling policy and check whether the number of instances increases as expected. Through the above steps, you can easily deploy auto-scaling EC2 instances using the AWS CLI.
