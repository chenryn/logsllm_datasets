“The Blighter AUDS counter-UAV system can detect a drone six miles (10km) away using electronic scanning radar, track it using 
precision infrared and daylight cameras and specialist video tracking software before disrupting the flight using an inhibitor to 
block the radio signals that control it. This detect, track, disrupt, defeat process is very quick and typically takes 8-15 secs.”
