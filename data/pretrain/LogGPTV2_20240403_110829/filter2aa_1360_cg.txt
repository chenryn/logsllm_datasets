Google Images reverse online search, the result will be other similar images, or exact duplicate images, on other 
sites. Visiting these sites provides more information on the target.
Note that adding context to the reverse-search field after submission can improve accuracy. As an example, a 
reverse-search of a photo from Linkedln might produce many inaccurate results, but including the name or 
employer of your target will often display only applicable evidence. Another way to use this service is to search 
for a target within the Google Images search page. The images in the results will present additional options when 
clicked. A larger version of the image will load inside a black box. The three options to the right of the image 
will allow you to visit the page where the image is stored, view the image in full size, or "Search by image". 
Clicking the "Search by image" link will present a new search results page with other images similar to the target 
image. These connect to different websites which may contain more intelligence about the subject

Regardless of the services that you arc executing, I urge you to use caution with sensitive images. Similar to my 
view of analyzing online documents for metadata, I believe that submitting online photos within these engines 
is harmless. If the photo is already publicly online, there is very little risk exposing it a second time. My concern 
involves child pornography and classified photos. As a former child pornography investigator and forensic 
examiner, there were several times that I wanted to look for additional copies of evidence online. However, I 
could not. Even though no one would know, and the photos would never appear any place they should not, 
conducting reverse image searches of contraband is illegal. It is technically distributing child pornography (to 
Google). While working with a large FBI terrorism investigation, I had possession of ten photos on which I 
wanted to conduct a reverse image search. The photos were part of a classified case, so I could not. Overall, 
never submit these types of photos from your hard drive. It will always come back to haunt you.
Whenever I have any public images that call for reverse image searching, I always check all five of these sendees. 
While I rarely ever get a unique result on Baidu, it only takes a few seconds to check every time. This diligence 
has paid off in the past. These manual searches do not need to be as time consuming as one may think. We can 
automate much of this process to save time and encourage thorough investigations. First, we should take a look 
at direct URL submission. For the following examples, assume that your target image is the cover of my privacy 
book from the web page at intekechniques.com/book7.html. The actual target image is stored online at the 
URL of https://inteltcchniques.com/img/EP2.png. The following direct addresses would conduct a reverse 
image search at each service listed.

Beginning in 2018, I noticed that both Google Images and Bing Images were returning fewer results than in 
previous years. It seemed as though each were trying to limit the number of matching photos, possibly with the 
intent to present only relevant images based on previous search history or whatever they "think” we want from 
them. In 2019,1 had an investigation focused around an online image. When I conducted a reverse image search, 
I received one result, which was a copy I already knew existed. When 1 cropped the image to only display my 
target, I received more search results. I find diis technique applicable to Google and Bing, but I believe it works 
best with Yandex. The following is a demonstration of this method, using a public image recently posted to 
Twitter.
Figure 21.02 (left) is the original image obtained from Twitter. A reverse image search through Google, Bing, 
and Yandex revealed numerous results, but none of them contained my target displayed on the far left. I cropped 
the image, as seen in Figure 21.02 (right), to display only the target and resubmitted to Yandex. This immediately 
identified numerous images of the target. Figure 21.03 displays one of these images. Both Google and Bing 
displayed no results from this cropped image. I cannot stress enough the importance of reverse-searching images 
through Yandex. I find their service superior to all others.
This service was mentioned in Chapter Fourteen and has a ven’ specific specialty’ which can be beneficial to an 
internet researcher. It is a reverse image search engine that only provides positive results that appear on the 
website Reddit. It was originally launched as a way for users to identify when someone reposted a photo that 
had previously been posted on the website. The user could then "down-vote" the submission and have it 
removed from the front page. We can use this in investigations to locate every’ copy of an individual photo on 
Reddit. You can either provide a link to an image or upload an image from your computer. The following static 
URL submits our target image for reverse analysis on Reddit.

Facebook also allows a specific query for images from posts. The traditional method is to search a keyword and 
navigate to the Photos filter. However, we can replicate this via URL, as follows.
For the first several years of Twitter's existence, it did not host any photos on its servers. If a user wanted to 
attach a photo to his or her post, a third-party photo host was required. These have always been free and 
plentiful. Often, a shortened link was added to the message, which forwarded to the location of the photo. 
Twitter now hosts photos used in Twitter posts, but third-party hosts are still widely used. The majority of the 
images will be hosted on Instagram, which was previously explained. If you have already identified your target's 
Twitter page, you will probably have the links you need to see the photos uploaded with his or her posts. Many 
Twitter messages have embedded images directly within the post. Twitter now allows you to search keywords 
for photo results. After you conduct any search within the native Twitter search field, your results will include a 
filter menu on the top. The "Photos" results will only include images which have a reference to the searched 
keyword within the message or hashtag. You can also filter this search for people, videos, or news. The direct 
URL query for all Twitter images associated with "osint" would be the following.
Real World Application: These reverse image search sites can have many uses to the investigator. In 2011,1 
searched a photo of damage to a popular historic cemetery that was vandalized. The results included a similar 
photo of the suspect showing off the damage on a blog. An arrest and community service soon followed. Later, 
while working with a private investigator, I was asked to locate any hotels that were using the client's hotel 
images on websites. A reverse image search identified dozens of companies using licensed photos without 
authorization. This likely led to civil litigation. More recently, a federal agent asked me to assist with a human 
trafficking case. He had a woman in custody who spoke little English. She was arrested during a prostitution 
sting and was suspected of being a victim of trafficking. A reverse image search from one online prostitution ad 
located all of her other ads which identified the regional areas that she had recently been working, a cellular 
telephone number connected to her pimp, and approximate dates of all activity.
This is another specialized reverse image search utility which only queries against images stored on the Internet 
Archive and within Open Library (also an Internet Archive product). Any results will likely contain public images 
such as published photos and book covers. I have yet to receive any benefit to my investigations with this service, 
but it should still be available in your arsenal of tools. Root About does not support search via a direct URL
Pictriev is a service that will analyze a photo including a human face and try to locate additional images of the 
person. The results are best when the image is of a public figure with a large internet presence, but it will work 
on lesser-known subjects as well. An additional feature is a prediction of the sex of the target as well as age.
While this is not a traditional reverse image search, it does provide value. The goal of this service is to identify 
the content of an image. If you upload a photo of a car, it will likely tell you the make, year, and model. An 
upload of an image containing an unknown Chinese word may display a translation and history details. The site 
prompts you to upload a digital file, but you can also drag and drop an image from a web page in another tab.

342 Chapter 21
In order to find a photo related to a target, the image must be stored on a website. The most common type of 
storage for online digital photos is on a photo-sharing site. These sites allow a user to upload photographs to an 
account or profile. These images can then be searched by anyone with an internet connection. Almost all of 
these hosts are free for the user and the files will remain on the site until a user removes them. There are dozens 
of these sendees, many allowing several gigabytes worth of storage. While I mentioned earlier that a Google 
Images or Bing Images search was most appropriate for all photo sharing hosts, Flickr deserves a mention.
Flickr attempts to geo locate all of the photos that it can. It attempts to identify the location where the photo 
was taken. It will usually obtain this information from the Exif data, which will be discussed in a moment. It can 
also tag these photos based on user provided information. Flickr provides a mapping feature that will attempt 
to populate a map based on your search parameters. I believe this service is only helpful when you are 
investigating a past incident at a large event or researching the physical layout of a popular attraction.
Flickr, purchased by Yahoo and now owned by SmugMug, was one of the most popular photo-sharing sites on 
the internet. Many have abandoned it for Twitter and Instagram, but the mass number of images cannot be 
ignored. The majority of these images are uploaded by amateur photographers and contain little intelligence to 
an investigator. Yet there are still many images in this "haystack" that will prove to be beneficial to the online 
researcher. The main website allows for a general search by topic, location, username, real name, or keyword. 
This search term should be as specific as possible to avoid numerous results. An online username will often take 
you to that user's Flickr photo album. After you have found either an individual photo, user's photo album, or 
group of photos by interest, you can begin to analyze the profile data of your target. This may include a username, 
camera information, and interests. Clicking through the various photos may produce user comments, responses 
by other users, and location data about the photo. Dissecting and documenting this data can assist with future 
searches. The actual image of these photos may give all of the intelligence desired, but the data does not stop 
there. A search on Flickr for photographs related to the Occupy Wall Street protesters returned over 157,000 
results.
Tumblr blogs have a heavy emphasis on images, and search engines do not always index associated keywords 
well. Therefore, we should consider a query specifically on the site. The following URL queries images associated 
with "osint".
There are three specific uses of the Flickr Application Programming Interface (API) that I have found helpful 
during many online investigations. The first queries an email address and identifies any Flickr accounts associated 
with it. The second queries a username, and identifies the Flickr user number of the connected account. The 
final option queries a Flickr user number and identifies the attached username. Unfortunately, all of these 
features require a Flickr API key. I have included a throwaway key within the search tools explained at the end 
of the chapter. However, it may not function for long after the book is published. If the key should be terminated 
by Flickr, simply request your own free key at https://www.flickr.com/services/api/. Once issued, replace my 
test key (27cl96593dad58382fc4912b00cfl 194) within the code of the tools to your own. A demonstration may

Navigating to the profile displays details such as the join date, followers, and photo albums. This may seem like 
a lot of work for a minimal number of details, but this is quite beneficial. There is no native email address search 
on Flickr, but we can replicate the function within the API. You may not find young targets sharing images here, 
but the massive collection of photos spanning the past decade may present new evidence which was long 
forgotten by the target.
Every' digital photograph captured with a digital camera possesses metadata known as Exif data. I have already 
explained several applications which extract this data from documents and images, but we need to have a better 
understanding of the technology. This is a layer of code that provides information about the photo and camera. 
All digital cameras write this data to each image, but the amount and type of data can vary. This data, which is 
embedded into each photo "behind the scenes", is not visible by viewing the captured image. You need an Exif 
reader, which can be found on websites and within applications. Keep in mind that some websites remove or 
"scrub" this data before being stored on their servers. Facebook, for example, removes the data while Flickr 
does not. Locating a digital photo online will not always present this data. If you locate an image that appears 
full size and uncompressed, you will likely still have the data intact. If the image has been compressed to a smaller 
file size, this data is often lost. Any images removed directly from a digital camera card will always have the data.
I now know that my target possesses a Flickr account associated with the email address, the username for the 
account, and the unique user number which will never change. Next, assume that we only knew the username.

1 consider Jeffrey's Exif Viewer the online standard for displaying Exif data. The site will allow analysis of any 
image found online or stored on a drive connected to your computer. The home page provides two search 
options. The first allows you to copy and paste an address of an image online for analysis. Clicking "browse" on 
the second option will open a file explorer window that will allow you to select a file on your computer for 
analysis. The file types supported are also identified on this page. The first section of the results will usually 
provide the make and model of the camera used to capture the image. Many cameras will also identify the lens 
used, exposure settings, flash usage, date and time of capture, and file size. In one example, I could see that the 
camera used was a Canon EOS Digital Rebel with an 18 - 55mm lens at full 55mm setting. Auto exposure was 
selected, the flash was turned off, and the photo was taken at 2:30 pm on May 7, 2011. Not all of this will be 
vital for the researcher, bur every bit of intelligence counts.
Many new SLR cameras, and almost all cellular telephone cameras, now include GPS. If the GPS is on, and the 
user did not disable geo-tagging of the photos in die camera settings, you will get location data within the Exif 
data of the photo. Figure 21.04 (left) displays the analysis of an image taken with a camera with GPS. The data 
is similar to the previous analysis, but includes a new "Location" field. This field will translate the captured GPS 
coordinates from the photo and identify the location of the photo. Farther down this results page, die site will 
display an image from Google Maps identifying the exact point of the GPS associated with the photo. Figure 
21.04 (right) displays this satellite view including a direction identifier. Since most cellular telephones possess an 
accelerometer, the device documents the direction die camera was facing. Most Android and iPhone devices 
have this capability’, ^our results will vary depending on the user's configuration of their GPS on the device.
This is one of the reasons you will always want to identify the largest version of an image when searching online. 
The quickest way to see die information is through an online viewer.
Scrolling down the analysis page will then identify many camera settings that probably provide little information 
to the researcher. These include aperture information, exposure time, sharpness, saturation, and other image 
details. Mixed in with this data is the serial number field. This is most common in newer SLR cameras and will 
not be present in less expensive cameras. These cameras usually identify the make, model, and serial number of 
the camera inside every photo that they capture. A serial number of a camera associated with an image can be 
valuable data. This can help an analyst associate other photos found with a target's camera. If an "anonymous" 
image was found online that included a serial number in the Exif data, and another image was found of a target 
of the investigation, these two photos can be analyzed. If the serial number as well as make and model of cameras 
match, there is a good likelihood that the same camera took both images. However, it is important to know that 
this data can be manipulated. Using software such as ExifTool, a user can modify this data. While this is not a 
popular tactic to use, it is still possible.

Real World Application: In a civil litigation, a subject claimed an injur}' that prohibited him from work, walking, 
and a normal life. The suit claimed damages from pain and suffering and sought a monetary judgment for future 
lack of ability to work. A brief scan of the subject's online photo album revealed fishing trips, softball games, 
and family adventure vacations. With Exif information data intact, exact dates, times, locations, and cameras 
were identified and preserved. The subject withdrew his lawsuit.
This site was designed to help camera theft victims with locating their camera if it is being used by the thief 
online. For that use, you would find a photo taken with the stolen camera, and drop it into the previous site for 
analysis. This analysis identifies a serial number if available. If one is located, type the serial number into Camera 
Trace. It will attempt to locate any online photographs taken with the camera. This service claims to have indexed 
all of Flickr and 500px with plans to add others. A sample search using a serial number of "123" revealed several 
results. The website urges users to sign up for a premium sen-ice that will make contact if any more images 
appear in the database, but 1 have never needed this.
Another piece of information that we can look for inside the Exif data is the presence of a thumbnail image 
within the photograph. Digital cameras generate a small version of the photo captured and store it within die 
Exif data. This icon size image adds very little size to the overall file. When a user crops the image, this original 
smaller version may or may not get overwritten. Programs such as Photoshop or Microsoft Photo Editor will 
overwrite the data and keep botii images identical. Other programs, as well as some online cropping tools, do 
not overwrite this data. The result is the presence of the original and uncroppcd image within the Exif data of 
the cropped photo. An example of this is seen in Figure 21.05. /\ cropped photo found online is examined 
through Jeffrey's Exif viewer. The cropped full-size large photo is seen on the left. The embedded smaller 
original photo was not overwritten when cropped. We can now sec what the image looked like before it was 
cropped. This technique has been used by police to identify child pornography manufacturers. These pedophiles 
will crop themselves out of illegal images to avoid identification. When photos of the children arc found by 
police, an original uncropped image may be enough to identify and prosecute a molester. This is not limited to 
law enforcement. Some tcch-sawy fans of television personality Catherine Schwartz examined a cropped photo 
on her blog in 2003. Inside the Exif data was the uncroppcd version which exposed her breasts and quickly 
made the rounds through the internet. We must remember this unfortunate lesson when we consider posting 
our own content to the internet.
