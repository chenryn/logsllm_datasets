### Reverse Image Search Techniques and Tools

#### Google Images Reverse Search
Google Images reverse search allows you to find other similar or exact duplicate images across the web. By visiting these sites, you can gather more information about your target. To improve the accuracy of your search, add context to the search field after submitting the image. For example, a reverse search of a LinkedIn photo might produce many inaccurate results, but including the name or employer of your target will often yield more relevant results.

To use this service, you can upload an image directly on the Google Images search page. Clicking on the image in the search results will present additional options:
- **Visit Page**: Go to the page where the image is stored.
- **View Image**: See the image in full size.
- **Search by Image**: Conduct a new search for other images similar to the target image.

These connected websites may contain more intelligence about the subject.

#### TinEye
TinEye is another powerful reverse image search tool. You can paste or enter the image URL to start the search. Here are the URLs for various reverse image search services:
- **TinEye**: http://tineye.com/search/?url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Google**: https://www.google.com/searchbyimage?site=search&sa=X&image_url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Yandex**: https://yandex.com/images/search?rpt=imageview&url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Baidu**: https://graph.baidu.com/upload?image=https%3A%2F%2Finteltechniques.com%2Fimg%2FEP2.png
- **Bing**: https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailv2&iss=sbi&q=imgurl:https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png

#### Caution with Sensitive Images
When using these services, exercise caution with sensitive images. Submitting publicly available photos is generally harmless, but avoid submitting child pornography or classified photos. Even though no one would know, conducting reverse image searches of contraband is illegal and technically constitutes distributing child pornography (to Google). As a former child pornography investigator and forensic examiner, I have seen the legal and ethical implications of such actions.

#### Manual and Automated Searches
For thorough investigations, I recommend checking all five major reverse image search services: Google, Bing, TinEye, Yandex, and Baidu. While Baidu rarely provides unique results, it only takes a few seconds to check. Automating this process can save time and ensure thoroughness. For example, if your target image is the cover of my privacy book from the webpage at inteltechniques.com/book7.html, the actual target image URL is https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png. The following direct addresses would conduct a reverse image search at each service:

- **TinEye**: http://tineye.com/search/?url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Google**: https://www.google.com/searchbyimage?site=search&sa=X&image_url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Yandex**: https://yandex.com/images/search?rpt=imageview&url=https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png
- **Baidu**: https://graph.baidu.com/upload?image=https%3A%2F%2Finteltechniques.com%2Fimg%2FEP2.png
- **Bing**: https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailv2&iss=sbi&q=imgurl:https://inteltechniques.com/img/EP2.png

#### Cropped Reverse Image Searching
Starting in 2018, I noticed that both Google Images and Bing Images were returning fewer results than in previous years. In 2019, during an investigation, I found that cropping the image to focus on the target yielded more results. This technique works well with Yandex. For example, Figure 21.02 (left) shows the original image from Twitter. A reverse image search through Google, Bing, and Yandex revealed numerous results, but none contained the target displayed on the far left. After cropping the image (Figure 21.02, right) and resubmitting to Yandex, I identified numerous images of the target (Figure 21.03).

#### Specialized Reverse Image Search Services
- **Karma Decay (karmadecay.com)**: A reverse image search engine that only provides positive results appearing on Reddit.
- **Root About (rootabout.com)**: Queries images stored on the Internet Archive and Open Library.
- **Wolfram Image Identification Project (imageidentify.com)**: Identifies the content of an image.
- **Pictriev (pictriev.com)**: Analyzes a photo with a human face and tries to locate additional images of the person.
- **Twitter Images**: https://twitter.com/search?q=osint&f=image
- **Facebook Images**: https://www.facebook.com/search/photos/?q=osint

#### Real-World Applications
Reverse image search can be invaluable in various scenarios:
- **Cemetery Vandalism Case (2011)**: A reverse image search of a vandalized historic cemetery led to the arrest and community service of the suspect.
- **Hotel Image Misuse**: A reverse image search identified dozens of companies using licensed hotel images without authorization, leading to potential civil litigation.
- **Human Trafficking Case**: A reverse image search from an online prostitution ad located all other ads, regional areas of activity, and a cellular telephone number connected to the pimp.

#### Photo-Sharing Sites
- **Flickr (flickr.com)**: Allows users to upload photographs, which can be searched by anyone. Flickr attempts to geolocate photos and provides a mapping feature.
- **Tumblr (tumblr.com)**: Has a heavy emphasis on images. Use the following URL to query images associated with "osint": https://www.tumblr.com/search/osint

#### Exif Data
Every digital photograph captured with a digital camera contains Exif data, which provides information about the photo and camera. Websites like Jeffreyâ€™s Exif Viewer (exif.regex.info/exif.cgi) can display this data. Many new SLR cameras and cellular phones include GPS, providing location data within the Exif data.

#### Cropped Images and Thumbnails
Some programs do not overwrite the thumbnail image in the Exif data when an image is cropped. This can be used to identify the original uncropped image, as seen in Figure 21.05.

#### Online Barcode Reader
- **Online Barcode Reader (online-barcode-reader.inlitercsearch.com)**: Provides additional barcode identification options.

By leveraging these tools and techniques, investigators can gather valuable intelligence and make informed decisions.
