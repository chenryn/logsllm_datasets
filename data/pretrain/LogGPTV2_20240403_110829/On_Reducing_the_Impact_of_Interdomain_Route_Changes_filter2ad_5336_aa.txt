Abstract. Interdomain route changes are frequent and they can have
negative impact on a network’s operation: during route convergence,
packets get delayed and dropped; after route convergence, changes in
the egress point for reaching a destination can alter the network’s in-
tradomain traﬃc patterns and trigger new traﬃc-engineering. In this
paper, we look into reducing the impact of interdomain route changes
on the network’s operation. First, we investigate a route decision pro-
cess which avoids the selection of routes that cause egress point changes.
However, this decision process does not consider the potential beneﬁt of
selecting a more preferred route even if it causes an egress point change.
Then, we propose a system which only avoids route changes causing re-
curring intradomain traﬃc shifts by processing the route changes history
and by selectively modifying route attributes which aﬀect the route de-
cision process. We evaluate both approaches using data from a major
European ISP. The modiﬁed route decision process avoids 89% of the
observed intradomain traﬃc shifts caused by interdomain route changes,
whereas route attribute modiﬁcations reduce the number of traﬃc shifts
on average by 25%, and as much as 50%.
1 Introduction
Interdomain route changes can be highly disruptive to a network’s operation
[1][2]. During route convergence, traﬃc can be delayed by routing loops or
dropped by temporary loss of routes [3][4]. This is particularly harmful for low-
latency and high-availability applications. Route changes also add considerable
operational overhead. After route convergence, traﬃc may traverse the network
through a diﬀerent path. This can modify the network’s traﬃc patterns and
trigger new traﬃc-engineering in order to eﬃciently use the network resources.
The higher the frequency of such route changes, the more time operators have
to spend ensuring a balanced traﬃc distribution in the network.
BGP route changes are caused by a variety of external events (e.g., remote
failures, new peerings, policy changes). Although BGP’s pathological behavior
has decreased considerably [5], many legitimate route changes still occur and can
cause disruptions to the aﬀected networks. Operators have no control over these
route changes but they can leverage their network’s path diversity [6] in order to

reduce the negative impact. Our work focuses on reducing the impact of inter-
domain route changes on networks with suﬃcient path diversity by avoiding the
route changes which lead to egress point changes. These changes take longer to
converge [7], harming data plane performance. They also aﬀect the network’s in-
tradomain traﬃc patterns and can interfere with the internal traﬃc-engineering
(e.g., the conﬁguration of MPLS tunnels).
First, we investigate a modiﬁed route selection algorithm called Stick-To-
Egress (STE) which avoids intradomain traﬃc shifts by preferring alternate
routes through the same egress point with that of the previously selected route.
The problem with STE is that it prioritizes the aversion of the traﬃc shift and
disregards the potential beneﬁt of the route change (e.g., permanently switching
to a shorter route advertised to another egress point). Then, we present a system
which targets more intelligent route selection and only avoids the traﬃc shifts
caused by recurring route changes. This system deviates less from the standard
route decision process and allows route changes unless the route history shows
that they are caused by unstable routes. It does so by boosting the route at-
tributes of previously selected stable routes in order to avoid the recurrence of
a route change. Route boosting exploits both the network’s path diversity and
the knowledge provided by already ”seen” route changes.
We perform a measurement study of the interdomain route changes as seen
by a major European ISP in a period of eight months. We ﬁnd that: 1) A consid-
erable amount of route changes have high impact: on average 46% of the route
changes cause intradomain traﬃc shifts, and from these, only 3% are intention-
ally caused by the network’s operators through routing policy changes. 2) 89% of
the observed traﬃc shifts could be avoided by STE. Thus, this network possesses
suﬃcient path diversity which can be exploited in order to make route choices
with minimum impact on the network’s operation. 3) 52% of the high-impact
route changes are recurring. 4) The route boosting avoids on average one in
four - and as much as one in two - traﬃc shifts caused by the observed route
changes. Also, it avoids the rerouting of traﬃc ﬂowing towards the top-ranking
destination networks for this ISP, helping to stabilize large traﬃc volumes. The
remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Sections 2 and 3, we present
related works and our dataset, respectively. In Section 4, we analyze the inter-
domain route changes observed by the ISP and emulate the STE route selection
algorithm. In Section 5, we present the route boosting system and investigate
its beneﬁts and cost. Finally, we conclude in Section 6.
2 Related Work
Interdomain routing is known to be unstable: routes change often [8], and a route
change can take hours to converge [9]. Several previous works are reactive; they
reduce the convergence time [10][11], or minimize the negative impact of slow
route convergence [12][13]. These works mitigate the impact of route changes on
data plane performance but do not address the problem of managing the unsta-
ble traﬃc patterns caused by the route changes. Proactive methods - including

our work - directly suppress unnecessary route changes. Route Flap Damping
(RFD) [14] deactivates routes that ﬂap frequently. However, RFD may suppress
relatively stable routes that only ﬂap momentarily, and thus, signiﬁcantly de-
crease the set of available routes [15]. Instead, our work increases the preference
of routes that are shown to be more stable. Also, RFD targets pathological rout-
ing instabilities whereas our work targets legitimate route changes. The latter are
recurring in longer timescales and impact a larger range of preﬁxes (not only the
unstable and unpopular ones [16]). Overall, RFD is complementary to our work.
Stable Route Selection (SRS) [17] proposes a modiﬁed BGP decision process
which prefers routes that have been up the longest. Route boosting also favors
route stability but only for preﬁxes which suﬀer from recurring route changes.
The rest of the preﬁxes do not necessarily beneﬁt from stable route selection.
So, route boosting lets their route selection follow the standard BGP decision
process. Additionally, route boosting also opts for intradomain traﬃc pattern
stability by favoring the selection of routes that maintain the currently selected
egress point.
3 Dataset
Our dataset includes routing tables from the backbone IP network of a major
ISP in Europe. This network is comprised by 13 BGP-speaking routers with
961 eBGP neighbors. Two routers are route-reﬂectors and maintain BGP ses-
sions with all other routers. The network has customer-to-provider, provider-
to-customer, and peer-to-peer relationships with its neighboring ASes. It has
customers in four continents, peers with hundreds commodity peers, and buys
transit from multiple upper tier providers. We analyze daily snapshots of rout-
ing tables over eight non-consecutive (due to missing routing tables) months in
2007 and 2008. A routing table snapshot contains approximately 200,000 dis-
tinct preﬁxes and as many as a million routes. It is important to note that, since
we do not have access to more frequent routing table snapshots, we only see a
sample of the interdomain route changes and the intradomain traﬃc shifts that
the network experiences. Thus, we are limited to the route change granularity
given by this sampling frequency. Finally, the dataset includes a summary report
of the outgoing traﬃc volumes per destination AS for a 24-hour period.
4 Stick-To-Egress Route Selection
First, we count the number of interdomain route changes that cause intradomain
traﬃc shifts: the new next-hop for reaching the destination preﬁx in the most
recent routing table snapshot resides on a diﬀerent egress router than the old
next-hop in the previous routing table snapshot. We ﬁnd that on average 46%
of the route changes cause egress point changes. We characterize these route
changes as high-impact. The rest of the route changes are mostly changes to
secondary routes, or changes to the AS-path of the best route.

Then, we analyze the high-impact route changes in order to exclude the
changes which are intentionally caused by the network’s operators and not by
external events. Operators change route attributes such as local-preference (LP)
and Multi-Exit-Discriminator (MED) in order to make routes more or less prefer-
able and aﬀect the route selection process. In particular, it is common to assign a
MED value at the import side of every session in order to show session preference
[18]. We illustrate the methodology for counting intentional route changes:

if RB1’ in RS2 where RB1.NextHop == RB1’.NextHop and
(RB1.LP != RB1’.LP
or

(RB2’.LP != RB2.LP
or
RB2’.MED != RB2.MED),
RB2’’ = Best(RS2 where RB2 is replaced by RB2’)
if
(RB2’’ == RB1), intentional route change
We consider a route change intentional when (i) we observe a change in the LP
or MED value of either the old or the new best route (lines 1-2, 5-6) and (ii) the
route change would not occur if the changed route attribute remained the same
(lines 3-4, 7-8). Condition (ii) is required so that, when a route attribute change
with no impact on route selection coincides with a route change caused by an
external event, the route change is not counted as intentional. In our dataset,
we ﬁnd only 3% of the high-impact route changes to be intentionally caused by
the network’s operators. For the rest of this paper, we focus on how to reduce
the impact of the unintentional route changes.
One way to reduce the impact of interdomain route changes is to modify the
route decision process and prefer routes that stick to the same egress point. The
Stick-To-Egress (STE) route selection algorithm prefers alternate routes through
the egress point of the previously selected route. Selecting such an alternate route
- if existing - ensures that route convergence is faster [7] and that the traﬃc
towards the destination preﬁx traverses the network via the same intradomain
path. We illustrate the STE route selection algorithm:
Prefer routes
1. With a higher local-preference.
2. Advertised to the same egress point with the previously selected route.
3. With a shorter AS-path.
4. Originated from IGP than from EGP.
5. With a lower Multi-Exit-Discriminator.
6. Learned from eBGP than from iBGP.
7. With lower intradomain routing costs.
8. From routers with lower router IDs.
STE adds the second step to the standard BGP decision process. The ﬁrst step
ensures that business relationships are not violated given that LP mostly rep-
resents business relationships between networks [19]. STE exploits the fact that

many networks have multiple routes to a single destination [6]. These networks
can use their alternate routes to avoid intradomain traﬃc shifts.
We emulate STE in order to estimate how many of the observed traﬃc shifts
the analyzed network could avoid by preferring routes that stick to the same
egress point. We see an - on average - 89% reduction in the number of intrado-
main traﬃc shifts caused by interdomain route changes. Although the interdo-
main routing activity varies during the analyzed period, STE constantly avoids
a high percentage of traﬃc shifts. Thus, the analyzed network has suﬃcient path
diversity which makes STE highly eﬀective in reducing the impact of interdo-
main route changes. We note that the cases where STE cannot prevent the egress
point change are when (i) no alternative route exists, or (ii) the most frequently
selected route has a diﬀerent egress point from the alternative routes.
5 Route Boosting
Should all
interdomain route changes causing intradomain traﬃc shifts be
avoided? STE also suppresses beneﬁcial route changes (i.e., route changes to-
wards more preferred and stable routes) because it has no means of assessing
whether the beneﬁt of avoiding a traﬃc shift outweighs the cost of settling
with a less preferred - according to the standard BGP decision process - route.
Route boosting assesses the beneﬁt of a route change by looking into the re-
cent route history and prevents only recurring route changes caused by unstable
routes. Speciﬁcally, it does not modify the route selection algorithm but suggests
routing policy changes which make the most stable route more preferable than
the unstable route that causes back-and-forth traﬃc shifts. The routing policy
changes prevent the future recurrence of the route change. Fig. 1 presents an
overview of the route boosting system.
