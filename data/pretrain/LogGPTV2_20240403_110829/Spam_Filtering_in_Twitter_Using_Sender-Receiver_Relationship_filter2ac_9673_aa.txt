Abstract. Twitter is one of the most visited sites in these days. Twitter
spam, however, is constantly increasing. Since Twitter spam is diﬀerent
from traditional spam such as email and blog spam, conventional spam
ﬁltering methods are inappropriate to detect it. Thus, many researchers
have proposed schemes to detect spammers in Twitter. These schemes
are based on the features of spam accounts such as content similarity, age
and the ratio of URLs. However, there are two signiﬁcant problems in
using account features to detect spam. First, account features can easily
be fabricated by spammers. Second, account features cannot be collected
until a number of malicious activities have been done by spammers. This
means that spammers will be detected only after they send a number of
spam messages. In this paper, we propose a novel spam ﬁltering system
that detects spam messages in Twitter. Instead of using account features,
we use relation features, such as the distance and connectivity between
a message sender and a message receiver, to decide whether the current
message is spam or not. Unlike account features, relation features are
diﬃcult for spammers to manipulate and can be collected immediately.
We collected a large number of spam and non-spam Twitter messages,
and then built and compared several classiﬁers. From our analysis we
found that most spam comes from an account that has less relation with
a receiver. Also, we show that our scheme is more suitable to detect
Twitter spam than the previous schemes

Introduction
Twitter has grown tremendously over the past few years. With sites such as
Google, YouTube, and Facebook, Twitter is ranked in the top 10 most visited
sites [1]. In February 2009, Twitter was the fastest-growing website with a growth
rate of 1,382% [2]. In 2011, people sent about 140 million tweets per day and
460,000 new accounts were created per day [3]. The enormous growth of Twitter
allows many users to share their information and communicate with each other.
This popularity, however, also attracts spammers.
Spammers have several goals, which are phishing, advertising, or malware
distribution. These goals are similar to traditional spam in email or blogs, but
Twitter spam is diﬀerent. Twitter limits the length of each message to less
than 140 characters. Because of this limitation, spammers cannot put enough
information into each message. To overcome this restriction, spammers usually
send a spam containing URLs that are created by URL shortening services.
When a user clicks the short URLs, he will be redirected to malicious pages.
Since the messages are short and the actual spam content is located on external
spam pages, it is diﬃcult to apply traditional spam ﬁltering methods based on
text mining to Twitter spam.
Many researchers have proposed methods to detect spammers in Twitter [4–
12]. These methods are mostly based on the characteristics of social networks. To
ﬁnd spammers and collect their information, honeypot-based approaches have
been proposed [4–6]. These studies created several honey-proﬁles and waited
for spammers’ contacts. After collecting spammer’s activity, they analyzed the
collected data and tried to automatically identify spammers by analyzing spam-
mer’s behavior. Other researchers tried to automatically detect spammers based
on statistical analysis [7–12]. They also collected a large number of user proﬁles
and manually classiﬁed the users into spammers and non-spammers. They con-
ducted a study of the characteristics of user proﬁles, user behaviors and tweet
contents based on the collected data. Finally they trained a classiﬁer to identify
spammers using data mining techniques.
Previous work has classiﬁed spammers with high accuracy, but two critical
limitations exist. First, they used the account features such as tweeting interval,
content similarity, age, the number of followings and the number of followers.
These account features, however, can be manipulated by spammers. For instance,
spammers can post both benign and spam tweets at irregular intervals. They can
also create several spam accounts and follow each other to raise their reputation
in social networks. Moreover, spammers can use accounts created a long time
ago to manipulate the age feature. Secondly, previous work is able to detect
spammers only after spam has already been sent to legitimate users because
user history data is needed to decide whether a user is a spammer or not. To
classify a user, previous methods need to know how a user has been tweeting and
what a user has been tweeting. Therefore, there is an inevitable delay between
spam account creation and its detection. Because of the delay, previous work
has been criticized [13]. Even if spammers are detected and removed, they can
still create accounts and then send spam again.
In this paper, we propose a spam ﬁltering method in Twitter. Instead of
account features, our study considers the relation features between a message
sender and a receiver, which are diﬃcult for spammers to manipulate. We con-
struct directed graphs based on the following and followed relations in Twitter.
In the graphs, we measure two relation features: distance and connectivity be-
tween users. The distance is the length of the shortest path and the connectivity
is measured by using min-cut and random walk. We investigated the distribution
of spam messages according to the distance between users. From the experimen-
tal results, we are able to ﬁnd that most spam comes from users at a distance
of more than three hops from receivers. We have also investigated the min-cut
and random walk between normal users, and between spammers and normal
users. From the results, we verify that the connectivity between normal users is
diﬀerent from the connectivity between spammers and normal users. Since our
system does not rely on user history data, it allows service managers or clients
to identify spammers in real-time. This means that when a user receives a mes-
sage from a stranger, our system identiﬁes the sender at once. If the sender is
identiﬁed as a spammer, the message is ﬁltered.
In summary, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:
– We propose a spam ﬁltering system for Twitter. We classify the messages
as spam or benign messages by identifying the sender. Our experiments are
performed on Twitter data, but we believe that our system can also be
applied in other social networks.
– We propose two relation features, which are distance and connectivity, to
identify spammers. These relation features are unique features of social net-
works and are diﬃcult for spammers to forge or manipulate.
– Our system identiﬁes spammers in real-time, meaning that service managers
or clients can classify the messages as benign or spam when a message is
being delivered.
We organize the remainder of this paper as follows. In Section 2, we brieﬂy
present the background on traditional spam and an overview of Twitter. Section
3 explains the overall processes including graph construction and features we
used to identify spam. Section 4 describes the experiments and evaluation results.
In Section 5, we discuss a few issues that need more consideration and in Section
6, we conclude the paper.
2 Background
Spam appears in email, blogs, Short Message Services (SMS), and Social Net-
working Sites (SNS). Many researchers have proposed schemes to detect spam.
The common feature of spam, as deﬁned by the researchers, is that it is unso-
licited one [14]. However, it is diﬃcult to decide whether a message is unsolicited
in receivers’ side. Thus, content ﬁltering methods are widely used [15]. In social
networking services such as Twitter, however, content ﬁltering approaches are
not eﬀective because spam contains only a few words and URLs. Domain and
URL blacklisting techniques have also been proposed to ﬁlter spam, but Grier
et al. showed that the blacklists are too slow to protect users since there is a de-
lay before hostile sites are included in blacklists [16]. Moreover URL shortening
services make it more diﬃcult to detect sites in blacklists. Thus, the approach
is not eﬀective in Twitter because almost all users use URL shortening services
due to limitation of message length. Because of these reasons, traditional spam
detection approaches are diﬃcult to apply to Twitter. Therefore, a new approach
is needed with a focus on the characteristics of Twitter.

2.1 Twitter features
There are Twitter-speciﬁc features including tweet, mention, reply, retweet, hash-
tag, following, and follower.
Tweet. In Twitter, both a post and posting action are called tweets. Twitter
restricts the length of tweets to no more than 140-characters. Because of this
restriction, people commonly use URL shortening services when they are posting
URLs. Similarly, spammers use shortened URLs and few words to attract clicks.
Following and follower. Following someone means subscribing their tweets as
a follower. If user A follows user B, B is following of A and A is a follower of B (see
Fig. 1). The updates of user B automatically appear to user A. This is similar
to Really Simple Syndication (RSS). Followings and followers are represented
as edges in Twitter graph. A Following relation means out-edge and a follower
relation means in-edge (see Fig. 1).
Mention. If @username is included in a tweet, it is called a mention. Mentions
appear to a receiver even if the receiver is not a follower of the sender. It is almost
the same as a message function on other social networking sites. Spammers
commonly use this function to send spam because normal users rarely follow
spammers. On Twitter, a reply is also considered a mention.
Retweet A retweet is a reposting another user’s tweet. When a user ﬁnds a
tweet that he wants to share with his followers, he can use the retweet function.
Hashtag The ’#’ symbol is a hashtag in Twitter. The hashtag is attached to the
front of keywords to categorize tweets. This function is the same as a tag used
in blogs. If a keyword is hashtagged a lot, it will appear in trending topics that
appear to all Twitter users. Spammers often use trending topics in their tweets
even though these topics are irrelevant to the contents of the spam messages.
They also try to make trending topics using the keywords they want.

Twitter users can report a spammer by clicking the “Report to @username for
spam” menu on the spammer’s proﬁle page. Reported spammers are reviewed
by the administrators and then suspended. Users can also report spammers by
mentioning them to the oﬃcial @spam account [17]. However, these manual
methods require users’ eﬀort and there are many fake reports. Besides the users’
reporting, Twitter has established several restrictions to prevent spam and abuse.
The representative restrictions are as follows:
– Following a large number of users in a short time
– Following and unfollowing someone in a short time or repeatedly
– A small number of followers compared to the amount of following
– Multiple duplicated updates
– Updates mainly consisting of links
The above restrictions, however, are easy to avoid and spammers can always
create new accounts even though their old accounts have been suspended. Still,
about a hundred spam accounts are reported to the @spam account every day.
Twitter published a blog post which stated that spam has been reduced as a
result of their restrictions and that they constantly stand against spammers [18].
According to the posting, the percentage of spam per day has decreased from
11% in August 2009 to about 1.5% in February 2010. However, the data that
only consists of percentages is diﬃcult to analyze objectively. If legitimate tweets
are increased much faster than spam, the percentage of spam is decreased. In
fact, Twitter grew by about 1,400% in 2009 [19]. Moreover, there are about 140
million tweets per day [3]. This means that there may exist about a million spam
messages, if 1% of tweets are spam.
3 Overview
We identify spam using the relation information between users. First, we measure
the distance of user pairs. For example, when two users are directly connected
by a single edge, the distance between the users is one. This means that the two
users are friends. When some user pairs have a small distance longer than one,
this means they have common friends although they are not friends themselves.
In our experiment, almost all messages that come from a user whose distance is
more than four are spam. Thus, the relationship is meaningless or untrustworthy
when the distance is over four. If some user pairs have a distance greater than
four, one of the users has very few relationships or no relationship like spammers.
Therefore, we treat the messages coming from a user whose distance is greater
than four as spam and we only identify the messages coming from a user whose
distance is at least four.
The second feature is the connectivity between users. The connectivity rep-
resents the strength of the relationships. An edge may exist between a legitimate
user and a spammer when the spammer establishes a relationship with a legiti-
mate user. Yu et al. called these edges attack edges [20, 21]. Each spammer has
few attack edges because the spammers are diﬃcult to establish relationships
with legitimate users. Thus, the connectivity between a legitimate user and a
spammer is weaker than the connectivity between legitimate users, when the
distance is the same. We measure connectivity by using random walk and min-
cut techniques. To evaluate our system, we collected a considerable amount of
normal messages and spam messages from Twitter and identiﬁed the messages
using their features. Distance and connectivity were not used in the previous
work for detecting spam and they are diﬃcult to be manipulated by the spam-
mers. In addition, our system allows service managers or clients to identify each
message in real-time. Thus, there is no delay, unlike in account-based methods.
3.1 Graph
To measure distance and connectivity, we used specialized subgraphs of the social
network graph representing the relation between users. Twitter network can be
represented by directed graph using following and follower relations. Our method
focuses on the relation between the message sender and the receiver. Thus, we
only construct the graph between them. Let a directed graph G = (V, E) be an
entire social network graph and G(cid:48) = (V (cid:48), E(cid:48)) be a subgraph of G satisfying the
following conditions:
1. The graph G(cid:48) = (V (cid:48), E(cid:48)) is a subgraph of a graph G = (V, E).
2. The source node s and terminal node t are included in V (cid:48).
3. All nodes in V (cid:48) are included in the paths from s to t.
4. All edges in E(cid:48) are included in the paths from s to t.
We construct the graph G(cid:48) and measure the distance and connectivity be-
tween a node s and a node t. In our case, the graph G is the entire Twitter
network graph, the node s a message receiver, the node t a message sender. Our
system evaluates the sender on the receiver’s position; thus, the paths from the
receiver to the senders are considered. In the graph G(cid:48), all nodes are included
in the paths from the receiver to the sender. There are three steps to construct
the graph G(cid:48) of Twitter.
1. Put the receiver, his followings and followings of his followings to V (cid:48) and
edges between them to E(cid:48).
2. Put the sender, his followers and followers of his followers to V (cid:48) and edges
between them to E(cid:48). If the distance between the sender and the receiver is
lower than four, G(cid:48) will be connected.
the sender from V (cid:48) and edges to them from E(cid:48).
3. Remove the nodes which are not included in the paths from the receiver to
