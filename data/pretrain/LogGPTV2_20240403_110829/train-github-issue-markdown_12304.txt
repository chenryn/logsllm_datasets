As an user, when completing challenges in a non-english language and running
into a challenge that does not have an active translation, I want a
notification explaining that translation is being worked on, and the current
one is missing. And invitation to contribute with it, perhaps?
Said notification should link to the translation repo's issues, with the
respective language tags selected.
Active translations are translations of a challenge that is relatively up to
date
