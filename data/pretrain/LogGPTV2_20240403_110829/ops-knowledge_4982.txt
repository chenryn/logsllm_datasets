User: I would like to wipe out all data for a specific kind in Google App Engine. What is the
best way to do this?
I wrote a delete script (hack), but since there is so much data is
timeout's out after a few hundred records.
Assistant: Yes you can:
Go to Datastore Admin, and then select the Entitiy type you want to delete and click Delete.
Mapreduce will take care of deleting!
