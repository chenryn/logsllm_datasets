**User:**
I would like to delete all data for a specific kind in Google App Engine. What is the best way to accomplish this? I wrote a deletion script, but it times out after processing a few hundred records due to the large volume of data.

**Assistant:**
To efficiently delete all data for a specific kind in Google App Engine, you can use the Datastore Admin tool. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Datastore Admin interface.
2. Select the entity type (kind) that you want to delete.
3. Click the "Delete" button.

The Datastore Admin will use MapReduce to handle the deletion process, ensuring that even large datasets are deleted effectively without timing out.
