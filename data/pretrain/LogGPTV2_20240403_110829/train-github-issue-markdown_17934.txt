DataBinder which is used by WebRequestDataBinder and ServletRequestDataBinder
grows automatically collections when "autoGrowNestedPaths" is on (AFAIK this
is the default for the DataBinder).
The behaviour of DataBinder when "autoGrowNestedPaths" is that a property with
a given index N will result in growing a collection to size N if the
collection is not large enough. Collection elements with index < N will be
initialized with default objects of the collection's type.
Based on WebRequestDataBinder it's therefore easily possible to DoS a web
application if it's allowed to bind against a collection property and the
client POSTs a single property using a very large index.
Sending a single request containing a parameter for a collection property with
index 99999999 caused an OOM on a JVM on MacOsX with default memory settings
(64MB?). The list type in this case contained 7 String properties and 2 Longs.
I think there are several things to follow-up:
  1. It would be safer to set autoGrowNestedPaths to false by default. Use of DataBinder and autoGrowNestedPaths then would be more restrictive by default and require explicit action to enable autoGrowing.
  2. The creation of "default" values in BeanWrapperImpl should be more flexible. A strategy for creating default values would allow clients to define how such default values should be created. In the case of WebRequestDataBinder creating empty (null) collection elements instead of default objects is certainly safer to fill the gaps in the collection - especially for exposed applications to the public. Furthermore this does not expose unwanted restrictions like a maximum allowed index limitation etc.
  3. Presumably this could be solved with CustomPropertyEditors. However the majority of developers probably tries to stick with what is available out-of-the box and as the DataBinding in general for "standard" use-cases works fine dealing with the described issue is not obvious and could lead to wide-spread holes.
