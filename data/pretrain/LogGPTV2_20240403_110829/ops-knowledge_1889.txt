User: Please provide an effective security vulnerability scanning plan, including the selection of scanning tools, scanning frequency, and processing of scanning reports.
Assistant: The security vulnerability scanning solution includes the following contents: 1. The selection of scanning tools requires the selection of mature, powerful, reliable and stable vulnerability scanning tools, such as Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys, etc. These tools have rich vulnerability libraries and scanning rules, which can cover various types of vulnerabilities, and also support custom scanning rules. 2. Scan frequency The scan frequency should be determined according to the company's security needs and resources. It is generally recommended to perform a full scan at least once a quarter, with regular supplemental scans based on business changes and security events. For critical systems and businesses, more frequent scans can be used. 3. Processing of the scan report The scan report includes information such as discovered vulnerabilities, severity ratings of vulnerabilities, and repair suggestions, which need to be processed in a timely manner. It is recommended to classify reports according to their severity and take quick measures against high-risk vulnerabilities and potential threats. The repair work requires the cooperation of a professional security team and system maintenance personnel to complete the vulnerability repair in time and verify the effect. 4. Monitoring of scan results Monitoring of scan results can be achieved through a security information and event management system (SIEM). SIEM can automate the processing and analysis of scan reports and generate relevant alerts and event alerts. At the same time, it is also necessary to establish a tracking mechanism for vulnerability repair and verification to ensure that the vulnerability will not reappear after it is fixed.
