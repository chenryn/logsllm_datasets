[0.0,6.0,0.0,1.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,7.4,0.9,0.0,1.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Periodic
B: Sparse
C: Stationary
D: Unable to determine

Assistant: Answer: B
