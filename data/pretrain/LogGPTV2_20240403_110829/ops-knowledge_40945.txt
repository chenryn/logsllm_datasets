I am using macOS Mountain Lion and have installed Python 2.7.4 from the official `python.org` website.

It appears that the newly installed version is invoked by the command `python2`, as it displays the version 2.7.4. The default, pre-installed version of Python on my Mac, which is 2.7.2, is invoked with the command `python`. Is this correct?

How can I configure the `python` command to point to the newly installed `python2` (version 2.7.4)?

**Solution:**

To change the `python` command to point to the newly installed `python2`, you need to update your system's PATH environment variable. This can be done by running a shell script provided by the Python installation.

1. **Locate the Shell Script:**
   - The shell script should be located in the `/Applications/Python 2.7` directory. It is typically named something like `UpdateShellProfile.command`.

2. **Run the Shell Script:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the shell script:
     ```sh
     cd /Applications/Python\ 2.7/
     ```
   - Run the shell script:
     ```sh
     ./UpdateShellProfile.command
     ```

3. **Verify the Change:**
   - After running the script, open a new terminal session or source your shell profile (e.g., `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`):
     ```sh
     source ~/.bash_profile  # or .zshrc, depending on your shell
     ```
   - Verify that the `python` command now points to the new version:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```

For more detailed information, please refer to the `README.txt` file included with the Python installation.
