dcgpofix
Recreates the default Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for a domain. To get to the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC), you must install Group Policy Management as a feature through Server Manager.
Important
As a best practice, you should configure the Default Domain Policy GPO only to manage the default Account Policies settings, Password Policy, Account Lockout Policy, and Kerberos Policy. Additionally, you should configure the Default Domain Controllers Policy GPO only to set user rights and audit policies.
