User: How to use Git to manage code? Please explain how Git basically works.
Assistant: Steps to use Git to manage code: 1. Create a new Git warehouse locally 2. Use the add command to add the files to be managed to the temporary storage area 3. Use the commit command to submit the files in the temporary storage area to the local warehouse 4. If you need to collaborate with other people, you can use the push command to push the code to the remote warehouse. 5. If you need to update the local code, you can use the pull command to pull the latest code from the remote warehouse. It is a "repository" (Repository), which stores the historical versions of all files in the current directory. In Git, each version of a file has a unique ID number called a "SHA1 value". This value can be used to find a specific version of a file, or to compare different versions of a file to determine how to merge them. When we perform an operation in Git, such as adding a file or modifying a file, Git will record this operation, form a new version, and update the repository. Git adopts the "Distributed" version control method. Everyone has a complete version library, and the modification and merging of files are all done locally. If you need to collaborate with others, you can push the changes in the local repository to the remote repository, or pull the latest version of the file from the remote repository. This distributed approach can improve collaboration efficiency and ensure data security.
