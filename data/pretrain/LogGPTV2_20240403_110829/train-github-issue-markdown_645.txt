I started trying to use VSCode with ES6 and I'm running into this. Changing
the declaration to `import * as path from 'path'` for example works for
intellisense, but then babel's transpiled output is invalid. Is there a plan
to switch to the current syntax? If not, could anyone point me to some
instructions on how to modify the d.ts files to work in this case?
