Question: In the WPA2-PSK protocol, several elements contribute to the security of the handshake process. What would be the potential security consequences of not including the MAC addresses of both the access point and the client in the derivation of the PTK? Select all that apply.
"A": "It would prevent the client and access point from verifying the integrity of the nonces exchanged during the handshake.",
"B": "It would make the PTK independent of the specific devices involved, potentially allowing for the reuse of the PTK across different sessions.",
"C": "It would increase the difficulty of brute-force attacks against the PTK due to the reduced complexity involved in its derivation.",
"D": "It could lead to a situation where the same PTK is used across different networks with the same SSID and password, weakening network segregation."
Answer: BD
