Based on previous issues, it is not clear if there are plans to incorporate
the implementation of `groupslices` from `GroupSlices.jl` into Base. This
function is quite common when one needs to just find the `unique` columns in a
large array for further processing.
Past discussions include:
  * #14142
  * #15503
  * #1845
The current registered version of `GroupSlices.jl` in Julia 1.x is a fork from
the original author's version. Any chance this functionality could be part of
Julia v1.5?
