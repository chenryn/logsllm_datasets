Deceptive 
Hacking 
How misdirection 
can be used to steal 
information without 
being detected 
Bruce “Grymoire” Barnett 
Magician & Computer Scientist 
Magicians and hackers have a lot in 
common 
• They like to wear black 
• They like to “shock” people 
• They have Secret Knowledge 
Assumptions 
.umptions 
Ass… 
Magicians’ Arsenal 
• Actions 
• Props 
• People 
• Basic Psychology 
– Misdirection 
• Advanced Psychological Techniques 
• Example of the Magician-Hacker 
Feint 
• Pretend to do something, but in reality nothing 
happens (the hand is empty) 
• “A False Show” 
Hack: Purposeful delay,  
“Checking your computer for viruses”  
Bluff 
• “Feint” but calling attention to the action 
• Pretending, when nothing really has happened 
or will happen.  
Hack: “We have detected a virus on your computer” 
Phish, Used in Social Engineering 
Sleight 
• ..is a Secret Action, combined with technique 
• Sleights are less valuable if they are well known 
• Sleights may require years of practice 
• Sleights can be worth money 
• Sleights are sold with an underground economy 
• The best sleights look natural 
Hack: Exploit, Buffer Overflow, 0Day. Etc. 
Temps or Timing 
• Timing is used to improve deception 
• Or make people forget 
Hack: Planning ahead, low frequency port scan 
Gimmick 
• A secret device 
• Performs some useful function which is 
unexpected because it is secret 
Hack: Rootkit 
Gaff 
• A visible device with a secret function 
Hack: Easter Egg, backdoor, hidden function 
Fake (Feke) 
• A simulation or emulation of a real device 
Hack: Trojan Horse, Man-in-the-middle 
Secret Accomplice, Stooge, Shill, 
Trusted Insider 
• Someone who knowingly helps the attacker 
• The victim does not know the insider is an 
enemy 
• The more trusted, the less they are suspected 
• “The Enemy of my Enemy” ploy 
Hack: Insider Threat, “Friend Request” from stranger 
Unwitting accomplice 
• Someone who unknowingly helps 
– “Please forward this to everyone you know” 
– “I’m trying to help one of your colleagues who’s 
visiting us today…” 
Hack: Social Engineering 
The Patsy, or “Fall Guy” 
• Innocent 
• But takes the blame 
Naturalness – first principle of magic 
• Often takes years to perfect some sleights 
• Failure to deceive occurs if unnatural 
– i.e. Email from your “friend”  
• The more natural it is, the greater probability of it succeeding 
• The Nemesis of the magician is the video 
recording 
– Forensics  
Hack: Everywhere 
And when naturalness isn’t possible 
• Minimize the unnaturalness as much as possible 
– E.g. Reduce the number of log entries, alerts 
– Make log entries look more natural 
• “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA” => “ProjectDirectory” 
• English Shellcode 
• Hide what you can’t eliminate 
– E.g. Oracle.com vs Orade.com vs. 0racle.com 
Hack: replicate legitimate e-mail, similar domain names 
And when you can’t, make the 
unnatural natural 
• Contrived Justification 
– Create a reason for the unnatural action 
– Social Engineering 
• Repetition  
– Making the unnatural natural 
– Make a script kiddy attack have the same log pattern 
as your attack 
Hack: Social engineering, port scans with secret attack 
Misdirection 
• A way to control attention so they don’t see 
anything unnatural 
Focus their attention away from the 
unnatural 
• Stimulate Interest 
– Attract attention 
– Appeal to their interests 
• Distract attention from the unnatural part 
– “OMG! Check out what she is doing in this picture!” 
Hack: Spam, thumbnails w/fleshtones 
Directed Misdirection 
• Can be caused by an action, or be distracting by its 
very nature. 
• Can cause suspicion 
• Attracts interest because of the topic 
– Lady Gaga!/Beyonce! 
– Justin Bieber! 
– Free iPad! 
• or uniqueness of the event 
– Setting off a fire alarm 
– Manipulating the HVAC 
– Another attack 
Discovered Misdirection 
• Done ahead of time 
• Undetermined when it happens. However, when 
discovered, it commands attention. 
• If you can control the timing….. 
Hack: Discovering a server is infected with a virus 
Constrained Misdirection 
• Hacker controls the “view” of the victim 
• Getting the victim to remotely access the system 
that is secretly under control  
Hack: Virtual Machine, Man-in-the-middle 
Encourage false conclusion 
• Develop a false premise 
– Provide evidence that the false premise is correct 
• Create a false alarm 
– Purposely create a condition that “raised an alarm” 
and then proves it was wrong. Repeat 
– Causes alarms to be distrusted 
• Repetition can be used to encourage a false 
conclusion 
– A Feint can mask a Sleight. 
Hack: fabricated evidence, EICAR signature in real virus 
Stuxnet? 
Use multiple methods 
• Spectator thinks that because a method  wasn’t 
used one time, concludes it wasn’t used ever. 
• Allows multiple ways to accomplish the same 
thing if one method will be detected 
• Purposely reveal method to encourage false 
conclusion 
Hack: Multiple 0days in virus 
The Switch 
• Let them examine everything before and/or after 
Hack: Switching malware in and out, self destruction 
Fake Revelation 
• Reveal an inferior method used by “others” 
• An example will follow…… 
Conclusion 
• By combining the toolkit and psychology of a 
magician 
• With the skills of a hacker 
• Creates a new style of hacking 
• The goal: undetectable hacking 
Now let’s create a scenario for the 
magician-hacker 
• Company XYZ has valuable IP 
• XYZ has excellent security 
• Hacker is already inside  
• If it is discovered that the IP is stolen, it is worth 
less $$ 
• Obvious exfiltration attempts would be detected 
The Patsy 
• Unlucky Lucy is administrator of the IP server 
• Lucy is smart and alert! 
• The magician-hacker has partial access to 
Lucy’s account and places some files in a 
directory she owns…… 
• Which are propagated through the network 
• He also creates some web\forum accounts using 
Lucy’s name, and posts outrageous comments 
• There is also Innocent Ivy……. 
Magic: Discovered Misdirection 
More preparation from the Magician 
Hacker 
• Places an archive of files on a public-facing 
server in an obscure but publicly accessible URL 
• Causes the off-site backup to increase in size 
each day 
• The file Lucy is sharing contains a 0day virus 
• Next he generates a faked press release 
Magic: Temps/Timing 
“Company XYZ announces Adult Services” 
Magic: Creating a False Conclusion 
Then he makes a phone call to 
Innocent Ivy 
• “I found some porn on your web server.” 
• Ivy reports this to Chief. 
• Magician-Hacker reveals details of “new exploit”  
Magic: Bluff, Unwitting Accomplice, Creating a False  
Conclusion, Reveal an inferior method used by others 
Meanwhile… 
• CEO is told of “adult  content” found on web site. 
• Blogs are now commenting on it 
• PR Nightmare begins.  
• XYZ published Press Release in response 
• CEO wants quick remedy. NOW! 
• Virus signatures created by AV companies 
Magic: Creating a False Alarm, Appeal to their interests 
“Random” e-Mail to Ivy 
• “One of your people, Lucy, was bragging about 
XYZ’s new adult services on a web forum.” 
• Rough draft of the forged Press Releases, and 
jpegs,  are also found in Lucy’s Directory 
• Ivy reports to Chief, Lucy gets fired 
• Virus signatures updated to include new attack 
Magic: Bluff, Directed Misdirection 
And then… 
• Second bogus Press Release published 
– Announces “Public Key,” with URL, signed w/key 
– Reiterates that Company is going into “Adult 
Services” 
– Claims CEO has “Issues” with company’s new 
direction 
– Anti-virus finds hundreds of infected files 
Magic: False Conclusion, misdirection 
The plot thickens 
• Infected machines start exporting random data 
to machines on the Internet 
• Anti Virus software detected infected files in 
Innocent Ivy’s directory, but these are different 
Magic: Discovered Misdirection, Naturalness, Repetition 
The Sucker Punch 
• Source code of the virus is found in Ivy’s 
Directory 
• Also –”Adult” web pages are found 
• Drafts of the second forged press release found 
• Innocent Ivy fired 
Magic: Discovered Misdirection, Naturalness, Repetition

Wrongful

Management 
Change in System 
Administration 
The goal of the magician-hacker 
• Steal the information from the database 
• Don’t be detected while it happens 
• Be as natural as possible 
• Leave no evidence  
What happened 
1. A full backup of the server started 
2. One small change DNS poisoning  
3. When done, all traces of the modifications are 
removed 
Magic: Sleight, Gaff, The Switch, Naturalness 
Lessons 
• Detecting the  magician-hacker requires 
understanding new actions and motivations 
• Unrelated events may not be unrelated 
• The obvious answer may not be the right answer 
• Increased forensics  
• People, like computers, are assets too
