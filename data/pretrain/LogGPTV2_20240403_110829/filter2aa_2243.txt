**Magician & Computer Scientist**

#### Introduction
Magicians and hackers share several common traits:
- They often wear black.
- They aim to "shock" people.
- They possess secret knowledge.

#### Assumptions
Both magicians and hackers rely on the following tools and techniques:

**Magicians’ Arsenal:**
- **Actions**: Physical movements.
- **Props**: Tools and devices.
- **People**: Audiences and accomplices.
- **Basic Psychology**: 
  - **Misdirection**: Diverting attention.
  - **Advanced Psychological Techniques**: More complex manipulations.
  
**Example of the Magician-Hacker Feint:**
- **Feint**: Pretend to do something, but in reality, nothing happens (e.g., an empty hand).
- **Hack Example**: Purposeful delay, such as "checking your computer for viruses."

**Bluff:**
- **Description**: A feint that calls attention to a non-existent action.
- **Hack Example**: Claiming, "We have detected a virus on your computer."

**Phishing in Social Engineering:**
- **Sleight**: A secret action combined with technique.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Less valuable if well-known.
  - Requires years of practice.
  - Can be sold in underground economies.
  - The best sleights look natural.
- **Hack Example**: Exploits, buffer overflows, zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Timing (Temps):**
- **Use**: Improving deception or making people forget.
- **Hack Example**: Planning ahead, low-frequency port scans.

**Gimmick:**
- **Description**: A secret device performing an unexpected function.
- **Hack Example**: Rootkit.

**Gaff:**
- **Description**: A visible device with a secret function.
- **Hack Example**: Easter Egg, backdoor, hidden function.

**Fake (Feke):**
- **Description**: A simulation or emulation of a real device.
- **Hack Example**: Trojan Horse, Man-in-the-Middle attack.

**Secret Accomplice, Stooge, Shill, Trusted Insider:**
- **Description**: Someone who knowingly helps the attacker.
- **Characteristics**:
  - The victim does not know the insider is an enemy.
  - The more trusted, the less they are suspected.
- **Hack Example**: Insider Threat, "Friend Request" from a stranger.

**Unwitting Accomplice:**
- **Description**: Someone who unknowingly helps.
- **Examples**:
  - "Please forward this to everyone you know."
  - "I’m trying to help one of your colleagues who’s visiting us today…"
- **Hack Example**: Social Engineering.

**The Patsy, or “Fall Guy”:**
- **Description**: An innocent person who takes the blame.

**Naturalness – First Principle of Magic:**
- **Importance**: Often takes years to perfect some sleights.
- **Failure**: Occurs if the action appears unnatural.
- **Effectiveness**: The more natural it is, the greater the probability of success.
- **Nemesis**: Video recording (forensics).

**When Naturalness Isn’t Possible:**
- **Minimize Unnaturalness**:
  - Reduce log entries and alerts.
  - Make log entries look more natural.
  - Hide what you can’t eliminate.
- **Hack Examples**:
  - Replicate legitimate email.
  - Use similar domain names (e.g., Oracle.com vs. Orade.com vs. 0racle.com).

**And When You Can’t, Make the Unnatural Natural:**
- **Contrived Justification**: Create a reason for the unnatural action.
- **Repetition**: Make the unnatural seem natural.
- **Hack Example**: Port scans with secret attacks.

**Misdirection:**
- **Definition**: Controlling attention to avoid detection.
- **Techniques**:
  - Stimulate interest.
  - Distract from the unnatural part.
- **Hack Example**: Spam, thumbnails with fleshtones.

**Directed Misdirection:**
- **Causes**: An action or by its very nature.
- **Effects**:
  - Attracts interest due to the topic.
  - Causes suspicion.
- **Hack Example**: Setting off a fire alarm, manipulating HVAC.

**Discovered Misdirection:**
- **Preparation**: Done ahead of time.
- **Discovery**: Commands attention when discovered.
- **Hack Example**: Discovering a server is infected with a virus.

**Constrained Misdirection:**
- **Control**: Hacker controls the victim’s view.
- **Hack Example**: Virtual Machine, Man-in-the-Middle attack.

**Encourage False Conclusion:**
- **Develop a false premise**.
- **Create a false alarm**.
- **Repetition** to reinforce the false conclusion.
- **Hack Example**: Fabricated evidence, EICAR signature in a real virus.

**Stuxnet?**
- **Multiple Methods**: Using different methods to achieve the same goal.
- **Hack Example**: Multiple zero-day exploits in a virus.

**The Switch:**
- **Description**: Letting them examine everything before and after.
- **Hack Example**: Switching malware in and out, self-destruction.

**Fake Revelation:**
- **Description**: Revealing an inferior method used by others.

#### Scenario: Company XYZ
- **Context**: Company XYZ has valuable IP and excellent security.
- **Objective**: Steal the information undetected.

**The Patsy:**
- **Unlucky Lucy**: Administrator of the IP server.
- **Hacker Actions**:
  - Gains partial access to Lucy’s account.
  - Places files in a directory she owns.
  - Creates web/forum accounts using Lucy’s name and posts outrageous comments.

**Magic: Discovered Misdirection:**
- **Preparation**:
  - Places an archive of files on a public-facing server.
  - Causes the off-site backup to increase in size each day.
  - The file Lucy shares contains a zero-day virus.
  - Generates a faked press release.

**Magic: Temps/Timing:**
- **Press Release**: "Company XYZ announces Adult Services."

**Magic: Creating a False Conclusion:**
- **Phone Call to Innocent Ivy**:
  - Reports finding porn on the web server.
  - Ivy reports to Chief.
  - Hacker reveals details of a "new exploit."

**Meanwhile:**
- **CEO Informed**: "Adult content" found on the website.
- **PR Nightmare**: Blogs comment on it.
- **Company Response**: Publishes a press release.
- **Virus Signatures**: Created by AV companies.

**Random Email to Ivy:**
- **Content**: "Lucy was bragging about XYZ’s new adult services on a web forum."
- **Evidence**: Forged press releases and jpegs found in Lucy’s directory.
- **Outcome**: Lucy gets fired, virus signatures updated.

**Second Bogus Press Release:**
- **Announces Public Key**.
- **Reiterates Adult Services**.
- **Claims CEO has issues**.
- **AV Finds Infected Files**.

**The Plot Thickens:**
- **Infected Machines**: Export random data to the Internet.
- **AV Detects Files**: Different from previous ones.

**The Sucker Punch:**
- **Source Code Found**: In Ivy’s directory.
- **Adult Web Pages Found**.
- **Drafts of Second Press Release Found**.
- **Outcome**: Innocent Ivy fired.

**Circle of Chaos:**
- **PR Nightmare**.
- **Virus Outbreak**.
- **IP Leaking?**.
- **Wrongful Termination**.
- **Confidence in Management**.
- **Change in System Administration**.

**Goal of the Magician-Hacker:**
- **Steal Information**: From the database.
- **Undetectable**: Avoid detection.
- **Natural**: Appear as natural as possible.
- **No Evidence**: Leave no trace.

**What Happened:**
1. Full backup of the server started.
2. Small change: DNS poisoning.
3. Traces of modifications removed.

**Lessons:**
- **Understanding New Actions and Motivations**.
- **Unrelated Events May Be Related**.
- **Obvious Answers May Be Incorrect**.
- **Increased Forensics**.
- **People as Assets**: Like computers, people are also assets.
