I'm finding a very odd issue that I was able to replicate on multiple
machines.
I have an html+js app that I wrapped around with Electron. I am having problem
with the MacOS distribution.  
There is one HTML text field that won't let me paste text into it. This bug
only happens after I follow the procedure to distribute the app (copy my app/
folder into Electron.app).
In all the other instances, I can copy or paste just fine :
  * when I run it via npm start (mac and win)
  * when I run it by doubleclicking electron.app and dragging app/ over it
  * on windows
I wonder, what can be the difference there? How can I debug something like
this?
