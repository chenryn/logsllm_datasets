User: I'm confused by some behavior of my Mac OS X Terminal and my Django manage.py shell and pdb.
When I start a new terminal, the Standard Input is displayed as I type. However, if there is an error, suddenly Standard Input does not appear on the screen. This error continues until I shut down that terminal window.
The Input is still being captured as I can see the Standard Output.
E.g. in pdb.set_trace() I can 'l' to display where I'm at in the code. However, the 'l' will not be displayed, just an empty prompt.
This makes it hard to debug because I can't determine what I'm typing in.
What could be going wrong and what can I do to fix it?
Assistant: If you exit pdb you can type reset and standard input echo will return. I'm not sure if you can execute something similar within pdb. It will erase what is currently displayed however.
