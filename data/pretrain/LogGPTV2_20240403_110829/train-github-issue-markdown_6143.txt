I've found that there is some direction that hiding the communication time
while computing einsum ops.

I think it would be implemented somewhere since the affiliation of the paper
is Google and used in TPU chips.  
Is there any reference implementation that I could follow?
Also, I found this information while reading the following paper.

If anyone who knows some reference implementations or materials that help to
implement it, please let me know.
Thank you for your support.
