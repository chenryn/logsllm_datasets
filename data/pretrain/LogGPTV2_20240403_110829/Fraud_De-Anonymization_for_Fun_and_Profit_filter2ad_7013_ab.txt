secret for security reasons [65], popular belief claims that large
numbers of positive reviews help products achieve higher search

Fraud Origin. The pressure to succeed has created a black market
for search rank fraud. Specialized fraud workers (also referred to as
Moreover, let U ∗ ⊆ U be the set of all fraudster-controlled
accounts in an online system, and let W be the set of all fraud
worker accounts in crowdsourcing sites. In addition, let W ∗ =
{(Wl , Ul , Sl )| Wl ∈ W, Ul ⊆ U ∗, Sl ⊆ S, l = 1 . . . f } ⊂ V be a
known set of f search rank fraud worker profiles where V is the
universe of all worker profiles. A profile consists of a crowdsourcing
account id (Wl ), an incomplete set of user accounts (Ul ) known to
be controlled by Wl in the peer-opinion system, and the incomplete
set of subjects (Sl ) known to have been fraudulently reviewed by
Wl . Section 9 describes a protocol to identify crowdsourced fraud
workers and build seed profiles for them.
Ideally, we want to attribute each account in U ∗ to the fraudster
who controls it. However, some accounts in U ∗ may not be con-
trolled by any of the known fraudsters in W ∗. To address this issue,
we formulate two distinct problems: fraud de-anonymization and
pseudonymous fraudster discovery:
Fraud De-Anonymization. Build a function F DA: U ∗\∪f
l =1Ul (cid:55)→
W ∗, that, given a user account u ∈ U ∗ suspected of participation in
search rank fraud, returns the fraud worker in W ∗ most likely to
control u. In Section 4.1 we expand this definition in a maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) based framing of the problem.
Pseudonymous Fraudster Discovery. Build a function PF D : U ∗\
l =1Ul (cid:55)→ V \W ∗ that, given a set of fraudster-controlled accounts
∪f
that were not assigned to one of the known fraudsters by the FDA
function, returns a new set of fraudster profiles from V \ W ∗ that
control these accounts.
Unlike standard de-anonymization, the adversarial process of
identifying users from data where their Personally Identifiable In-
formation (PII) has been removed [52], the fraud de-anonymization
problem seeks to attribute detected search rank fraud to the humans
who posted it. A solution to this problem will enable peer-review
services to identify the impactful crowdsourcing fraudsters who tar-
get them, and provide appealing fraud feedback proof to customers,
e.g., links to the crowdsourcing accounts responsible for boosting
a product’s rating. Furthermore, accurate fraud de-anonymization
will allow online services and law enforcement to retrieve bank-
ing information and real identities of fraudsters. Thus, fraud de-
anonymization may provide counter-incentives for crowdsourcing
workers to participate in fraud jobs, and for product developers to
recruit them.
In Section 4 and 6, we introduce unconstrained optimization and
discriminative fraud de-anonymization algorithms, respectively,
while in Section 7 we propose a pseudonymous fraudster discovery
algorithm. In Section 8, we show how Detego iteratively invokes a
pseudonymous fraudster discovery algorithm followed by a fraud-
ster de-anonymization algorithm, to expand knowledge of fraud
workers and the accounts they control.
4 UNCONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION BASED
DE-ANONYMIZATION
We first propose a maximum likelihood based de-anonymization ap-
proach motivated by a realistic generative model of review posting
behavior. Next, we compute the likelihood of each worker having
generated a given suspicious fraudulent review history. We then
find the worker who maximizes such likelihood.
4.1 Definitions and Approach
We postulate a probabilistic review-posting model from accounts
controlled by fraudsters, inspired by Su et al. [69]. Specifically, we
assume that a fraudulent account u controlled by a fraudster profile
(W , U , S ) ∈ W ∗ is likely to review subjects in a pairwise-disjoint
family of sets over S, FW = {Ω1, Ω2, . . . , Ωm} (Ωi ∩ Ωj = ∅∀ i (cid:44) j)
with different multiplicative factors r1, r2, . . . , rm describing u’s
responsiveness to each Ωi. Further, we assume that the review
history of a user account is described by a sequence of indepen-
dent and identically distributed random variables R1, R2, . . . , Rn
where Rk ∈ S represents the k-th subject reviewed from the ac-
count. Therefore, a fraudulent account’s review posting behavior
is characterized by FW and ri for all i = 1 . . . m.
Let {pj} be a probability measure over the sample space S, re-
j=1 pj = 1. For
any fraudster profile (W , U , S ) ∈ W ∗, we define random variable
Rk (FW, r) with values in S and with the probability distribution:

of multiplicative factors. Specifically, the probability that the k-th
review targets subject sj is proportional to factor rm if subject sj
satisfies Ωm’s membership properties. Otherwise, this probability
is simply given by the ratio pj /c.
Let R1 (FW, r), R2 (FW, r), . . ., Rn (FW, r), be a review history
suspected to be fraudulent. Given a set of candidate workers, each
described by a family of sets FW, the fraudster de-anonymization
problem derives the maximum likelihood estimates ˆr and ˆFW of
the function:

4.2 UODA
We introduce UODA, an unconstrained optimization based de-
anonymization approach that maximizes the function in Equa-
tion (2) without any constraints on the multiplicative values r1, . . . , rm.
Theorem 4.1 characterizes the solution for the fraudster de-anony-
mization problem under this unconstrained setting.

Theorem 4.1. Let S be the set of subjects hosted by the online
j=1 pj =
1). Let C = {FW1 , . . . , FWf } be a collection of family sets for each
fraud worker, where FWl ={Ωl1, Ωl2, . . ., Ωlm}. For any FW ∈ C,
define a random variable Rk (FW, r) taking values in S and obeying
the probability distribution in Equation (1). Given a review history

Intuition. Equation (4) from Theorem 4.1 attributes a user ac-
count to the worker profile in W ∗ most likely responsible for the
account’s review history R1 (FW, r), R2 (FW, r), . . ., Rn (FW, r). The
Ω sets partition worker’s reviews into groups of subjects that have
different characteristics (features). qi is the fraction of subjects in
the account’s review history that are in the investigated worker’s
Ωi. Pi is the total popularity of all the subjects in the set Ωi. The
first term of Equation (4) reveals that the ˆFW associated worker
most likely to control the suspect account has a family of Ω sets
for which most of qi are large and Pi are small; that is, many of the
subjects in the account’s review history appear in the worker’s sets
Ωi that are neither too big or popular.
