Question: Why is it generally a poor security practice to derive cryptographic keys from human-memorable passwords or passphrases?
"A": "Human-memorable passwords often lack sufficient entropy and can be vulnerable to statistical guessing attacks.",
"B": "Cryptographic hash functions such as SHA256 are too slow and computationally intensive, making the system prone to denial of service attacks.",
"C": "Deriving keys from passwords requires too much storage space to maintain a secure mapping of passwords to keys.",
"D": "Password-based keys are usually very long and complex, making it difficult for users to remember without compromising security."
Answer: A
