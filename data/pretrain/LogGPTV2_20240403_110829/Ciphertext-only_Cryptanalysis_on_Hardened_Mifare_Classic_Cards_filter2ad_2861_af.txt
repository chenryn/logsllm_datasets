Hardened mifare Classic cards (e.g. SmartMX and mi-
fare Plus) are not susceptible to previously published card-
only attacks. However, they are vulnerable to our attack
described in this paper. Moreover, in order to mitigate our
attack, backwards compatibility with the mifare Classic
protocol is inherently broken. Therefore, we conclude that
all mifare Classic compatible cards should be regarded as
plain memory cards and system integrators can no longer
trust their data’s authenticity and conﬁdentiality.
We have fully implemented and tested our attacks in prac-
tice on various hardened MIFARE Classic cards and recov-
ered secret keys within minutes. Furthermore, we present
an extensive complexity analysis with the theoretical bound-
aries to give a better estimate of the average running-time.
The only prerequisite of our attack is that a single key
must be known in advance. However, in practice this re-
quirement is almost always satisﬁed due to the massive de-
ployment of cards that use a default key for at least one or
more memory sectors.
We have notiﬁed the manufacturer NXP seven months in
advance of publication and practically demonstrated our at-
tack on their hardened mifare Classic cards. After notiﬁca-
tion, we attended several meetings to discuss the attack and
its impact. Furthermore, they asked us to review a draft of
their customer notiﬁcation letter wherein they acknowledge
our work and discourage to use the mifare Classic compat-
ible technology in the future.
7.1 Recommendations
We strongly advice system integrators to migrate away from
mifare Classic compatible systems and start using strong
and cryptographically secure systems. There are many al-
ternative contactless smart cards that support well-studied
cryptographic algorithms and formally veriﬁed authentica-
tion protocols. However, system integrators which are ab-
solutely unable to upgrade their infrastructure could tem-
porarily consider the following palliating countermeasures:
(i) Deploy hardened cards and diversify all keys. – Re-
quires the adversary to perform a diﬀerent attack prior
to ours, involving either eavesdropping or communica-
tion with a reader. This has to take place in a con-
trolled environment, risking camera detection.
(ii) Perform authenticity and integrity checks in the back-
oﬃce on a regular basis to detect fraudulent transac-
tion.
