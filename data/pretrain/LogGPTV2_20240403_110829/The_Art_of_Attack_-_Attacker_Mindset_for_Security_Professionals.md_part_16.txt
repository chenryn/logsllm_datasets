In a strategy meeting or planning meeting with your team,
brainstorming sessions that result in everyone pouring out their
ideas, fueling yet more ideas and solving the problem, is an example
of nonlinear thinking. Asking open- ended questions in an attempt
to solve a problem is another example. In the field, asking targets of
the environment a question like “I’m new here. How do you request
a new badge?” is an example of nonlinear thinking. You might not
need one, but you will be able to pivot in any case.
By contrast, the thoughts of a linear thinker tend to form a line,
meaning that at any given time, it is obviously that one thought
leads to the next, then to the next, and so on. The implicit assump-
tion in referring to somebody as a linear thinker is that the thought
process is easy to understand, and that the conclusions seem logi-
cally sound. There are pros and cons to both. For instance, linear
thinkers are good in subjects that work on cause and effect. But
there is a danger in relying too heavily on logic. The danger is
related to where you start. Once a starting point is chosen, there
are reduced numbers of logical conclusions to any given problem.
There is immense beauty in logic; it allows us to reach an answer
from a given starting point. Unfortunately, relying on one starting
point can prevent you from finding a more beneficial answer in
some situations.
132 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
For example, imagine trying to get over a nine-f oot smooth wall
with no ladder or ropes. You might try many ways: running, jump-
ing, and aiming to catch the top of the wall. But what if you were
so seized by that logic and starting point that you forgot you could
probably dig under it? This example is simplistic, but it features
what is often a linear thinker’s downfall: the inability to be agile
once a direction is set. Logic says that you have been tasked with
getting over the wall (the starting point), and it pushes you to do so
with all the ways you can think of. Rigid thinking isn’t always a bad
thing, but it shouldn’t be used at the expense of creative thinking
for long if the results aren’t in your favor.
The pros of nonlinear thinkers are that they are good at grasp-
ing abstract subjects and, importantly, creatively solving a problem,
something often required on an engagement. As an example, on a
job in 2020 for Social-E ngineer LLC, my team successfully snuck a
petite- sized human down a trash chute and into the kitchens, which
were one wall away from the SOC, which was accessible through
the roof of the chef’s bathrooms. I picked up on the scent of that
route by pushing my phone camera through the bin hole and film-
ing the inside. The assumption was that they must go somewhere.
Upon reviewing the footage, we could see light at the other side
of the bin encasement. We had tried to get in the door for hours
before that point. Logically it made sense. It was the only door we
could get to at that point; we had tools to get past the lock, but we
couldn’t. We kept trying, though, because we did not want to give
up. Trash chutes are unrelated in our minds as access to a room.
Nonlinear thinking banishes those restrictive thoughts.
Tying Them Together
Critical thinking is an important part of performance. Mentally
manipulating information to make effective decisions is possible
with access to information and accurate evaluation of it.
As the name suggests, and as we have seen, nonlinear think-
ing is not thinking along straight lines or in a sequential manner.
Information Processing 133
In nonlinear thinking, we make connections among unrelated con-
cepts or ideas. Nonlinear thinking can expand in multiple direc-
tions, rather than in one direction, and count on the probability that
there are multiple starting points from which to apply logic to a
problem in order to solve it. Nonlinear thinking is less constrictive
but not wholly less structured.
All of these types of thinking are important. AMs relies on
thinking outside the bounds of what is average. The real power is in
knowing when to use each of them or when a combination of types
might be used. For an attacker, logic is best used when you have
time and information. Reasoning should be used wherever you can
employ it— either creatively or logically.
Summary
• None of us can observe everything closely, so we have to aim to
select the significant.
• To observe in an effective and efficient manner, you have to
train your attention as an attacker, learning to focus on relevant
features and disregard those that are less salient.
• Intuition is not, contrary to popular belief, something we are
born with. Observation and experience help inform intuition.
• Lie detection myths flood the social arena of pseudoscience, but
reading people, expressions, and environments stem from the
general act of observation. The more you do it, the better you’ll
get at it.
• Critical thinking dictates that, if need be, any solution can be
changed to better fit the current situation and is an important
part of performance.
• Being able to evaluate information and arrive at a decision that
advances or benefits the situation is the desired outcome of crit-
ical thinking.
• Being able to use heuristics when critical thinking fails you or
cannot be used is often the difference between fast failure or
continued success.
134 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
• No matter what, problem solving is a required skill. Most of us
can often get there with some measure of critical thinking, intu-
ition, or heuristics.
• Nonlinear thinking is the key component of this ability. How-
ever, nonlinear thinking is not akin to chaotic thinking. It’s an
ability so solve problems from multiple starting points and from
different directions.
• Finally, critical thinking and intuition can work in tandem with
nonlinear thinking.
Key Message
Sufficient observation to arrive at an outcome is key to a successful
attack. One of the challenges you’ll face as an attacker is to observe
in a way that is not conducive to everyday living. To do this, you
must learn how to parse visual and auditory information efficiently.
Critical thinking is purposeful and deliberate cognitive process-
ing and serves other higher-l evel tasks such as decision-making.
You must do so without the burden of cultural pressure from your
workplace or peers.
Nonlinear thinking does not equal chaos. An attacker’s mind
is geared toward precision. Understanding it in this way will pay
dividends.
All types of thinking eventually intertwine with mental agility,
which is a fancy way of saying “adapting” and means that you take
the information and successfully apply it to your circumstances or
objective.

Information Processing
in Practice
T
o talk about how to process information, we first have to talk
about information itself. When I talk about information,
I mean facts, figures, knowledge, details, evidence, findings,
insight, and intelligence. Finding these sorts of information types is
most commonly achieved through Open- Source Intelligence, often
referred to as OSINT.
OSINT means many things to many people. Its official definition
is the practice of collecting information from published or otherwise
publicly available sources. These sources include newspapers, broad-
casts, official government documents made available to the public,
and most often OSINT is reduced to information available online. Of
course, there are other ways to gain information that are either not
listed in this book or illegal.
However, just having heaps of information on a company or its
asset, as examples, is not the final step in your intelligence gather-
ing endeavors. You, as the collector, must be able to scrutinize infor-
mation for its value in relation to the objective set out.
135
136 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
Now we can talk about information processing. Information
processing is how you perceive, analyze, manipulate, use, and
remember information. Processing information is as critical as col-
lecting it, and it must be processed strictly through the use of the
laws of the mindset, which are:
1. Start with the end in mind
2. Weaponizing information for the good of the objective
3. Pretext can never be broken*
4. Every action taken must be in support of the objective
*If you are too early in the process to have a pretext, this takes
the form of being in your attacker mindset—being curious, persistent,
and acting on behalf of the other three laws.
In this chapter, we look at what reconnaissance is and, broadly
speaking, how it is performed. But most importantly, we look at
how to make information agile and the power behind your attacks.
Reconnaissance
Good reconnaissance is critical to great ethical hacking and attack-
ing. Reconnaissance is generally the bulk of an attack, which
explains why using the four laws of AMs in conjunction is so criti-
cal. All the information you gather has to further your attainment
of the objective and help you with law 3 (don’t break pretext) in
particular.
We can then further reduce part of AMs’s second law of gath-
ering, weaponizing, and leveraging information to a type of self-
discipline. Given that your mind as an ethical attacker (EA) most
often is curious, it’s easy to commit to the belief that persistence
goes hand in hand with curiosity. Self- discipline will keep you safe
from the epic time sink of a rabbit hole that leads nowhere. For
example, if your job is to get into a data center whose lock cannot
Information Processing in Practice 137
be picked, that is guarded by armed guards, that employs 24/7 sur-
veillance, and that is also manned by drones, you will spend time
looking in the most obvious places— shift switch times, distraction
techniques, and drone information—i n an attempt to replicate the
design and get your own bird’s- eye view, ways to jam the signal, and
ways to take over or stop the other surveillance feeds. But you might
also look to the sewers, which are most likely not monitored. Cases
like this are currently rare but will become increasingly common as
the future unfolds.
In a more likely scenario, if the objective is to gather personal
data on an executive so that you can simulate an attack directly on
them—now a common occurrence in this industry— you will spend
a disproportionate amount of time looking for personal rather than
professional items. You wouldn’t forgo looking at the target’s pro-
fessional life altogether, but you would let it lead you, when and
where possible, back to their personal life. If you had to form an
attack on an executive based on their professional life only, you
would not follow any leads back to their professional life that you
couldn’t link back to them personally. For example, you would link
them only to peers with whom you could prove they had an exter-
nal relationship.
As an example, I will use myself. I will not use dorks (AKA
“Google Hacks”) or too many specialized search terms, but if you
are interested, please refer to the notes section on the website where
you can catch up on more reading and brush up on more OSINT
skills, including dorks. I will move through the example quickly,
because it’s not an exhaustive show-a nd-t ell of how to search, but
merely an illustration of how to stay somewhat disciplined and
what information is worth gathering, superficially.
If an attacker were given me as a target to attack, and the scope
cleared that attacker to phish, vish, or socially engineer me in per-
son, only using personal information, I suspect it would go some-
thing like this:

Google search: Maxie Reynolds
I clicked the first five links on the first page of Google results,
as seen in Figure 7.1 and one from the second page of results, as
shown in Figure 7.2.

By clicking the third search result (twitter.com) shown on the
first page of results, I was able to find that I have a dog and a Mac-
Book Pro, as shown in Figure 7.3.

140 THE LAWS AND SKILLS
With enough investigation (looking around the page, checking
the comments, or using brute-f orce Google searches), you could
work out the dog is a Pharaoh Hound, which is not a common
dog. That information might be valuable, depending on what else
you can find. It goes in the first bucket: recon.
Figure 7.4 Further information on Target
Figure 7.4, also shows relevant information. Thanks to it, you
now know I was born in 1988— which is always handy informa-
tion. You know that I am Scottish, which may be valuable used in
conjunction with other information. You know that I wrote another
book (Would I accept an interview request for this book? Would I
accept it via email?) and that I have at least one loose tie to the BBC
in Britain. You also know I live in the Los Angeles area (good info
for all sorts of attacks). From here you could check Facebook or Ins-
tagram to see if you could narrow down an address. If that proved
futile, you could check other photos for famous landmarks in the
frame and pinpoint my typical movements and even my location.
Case in point, I often run OSINT challenges on my own social
media as is seen in Figure 7.5. Recently I posted this photo:
Information Processing in Practice 141
Figure 7.5 OSINT challenge example from social media
From that photo, some 160 people were able to pinpoint
my location.
Back to finding an attack avenue: In the case of my workplace’s
website at the time of writing, as seen in Figure 7.6, which I could
then use to reverse search, getting an app or service to do a fair
amount of heavy lifting for me. Yandex is especially helpful. Yandex
is the most-u sed search engine in Russia and, in my opinion, is by
far the best reverse image search engine, with a powerful ability
to recognize faces, landscapes, and objects. At the time of writing,
however, there were no valuable leads found with Yandex. So I pivot
back to my original find—the page I got the image from.
This is an example of a professional page giving personal infor-
mation. It also lets you know I have ties to the SANS Institute (Phish
from SANS?) and that I used to work offshore with underwater
robots (Would I answer a phish from a university or science, tech-
nology, engineering and mathematics [STEM] course asking me
to take part in an initiative for kids regarding underwater robots?
I probably would).
142 THE LAWS AND SKILLS

Further investigation into the book could lead you in a thou-
sand different ways. You could contact me looking to do a follow-
up for a podcast. For a vish, you could pretend to be a reporter,
aiming to get information for an article. You could ask me to
verify myself, which isn’t the strongest move, but it might work.
By getting some security questions out of me, you might gain
some valuable information. You could also use this information
to approach me as an aspiring author looking for tips (which
wouldn’t be believable— I’d know you hadn’t read the book) and
ask for my address to send a copy of your own manuscript to. The
podcast’s description mentions that I’ve dabbled in stunts; this
is another avenue to explore. You can make certain inferences:
I must be pretty fit or must have been quite fit at that time. Was
there a specific place I was training? A few searches would tell
you that I trained at a popular private gym in West Hollywood.
There’s another avenue to explore.
You could use this information in a number of ways against
me. Picking one would depend on the objective, whether it is
to find details, discover sensitive information, or perform a
long attack.
So, in under two minutes, with one search and by scanning
a few finds, you could’ve identified three potential phishes and a
good amount of detail: my year of birth, nationality, computer type,
Information Processing in Practice 143
and ties to large establishments. Most of these, especially the last,
have good jumping- off points in which more information could be
searched for and tied back to the objective.
This is a light take on what AMs is capable of; it’s thought-
provoking for the newest members of the community or those who
are just interested, and it’s probably too superficial for the veter-
ans among you. However, the purpose of the search is not to show-
case deft skills that you can learn and perform for your own work;
instead, it is intended to show that information can be found any-
where, and nothing precludes a result from being useful— only the
objective does.
It’s your self- discipline as an EA that keeps you from going
down the rabbit hole of “Technical Team Lead” or searching for
more information on my consulting with government agencies,
because it doesn’t follow the objective and you may not have ruled
out the possibility of more information that better fits your objec-
tive. Only when all else had failed would you resort to those sorts of
searches in case there was a hint of a personal artifact.
