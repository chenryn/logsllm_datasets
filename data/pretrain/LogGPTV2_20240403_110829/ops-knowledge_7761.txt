User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Nginx 1.2.1: How to analyse 500 Internal Server Error I'm responsible for a nginx server that redirects and splits requests. At our production engine we run nginx 1.2.1 and on a test machine we run 1.4.1. The configuration is the same but on the production environment I always get a 500 Internal Server Error"but on the test environment all runs fine. I always checked the access.log and the error.log of Nginx. But there is nothing to worry about.

How can I analyse the error and do some further investigation on the cause of this error?

Assistant: Here is the nginx checklist I use when diagnosing errors.


verify your nginx configuration using

sudo nginx -t


it is a very basic step but one that should always be done first.
verify nginx is running

sudo service nginx status

Verify the log files specified in your site configuration

find /etc/nginx -name '*.conf' | xargs grep -i log

If you are getting a 500 error, you should be seeing an entry in your error log related to the error that will give you a hint as to why the error is happening.  If you do not see an error message in your error log, you have an error log configuration problem and you will want to verify the timestamps on the error log file to make sure it is being updated.
