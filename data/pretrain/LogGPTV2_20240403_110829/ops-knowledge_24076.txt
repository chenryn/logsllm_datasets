User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Strange entry in Apache log in my previous post I got something weird in Apache log. Again, I found something strange, but what freaks me out is the response code. It's not 501 anymore, but 200. What do you say? Should I enable the paranoid-mode? Here's the entry:

***.***.***.*** - - [02/Feb/2011:00:42:51 +0100] "=\xa29)\x84\x11\xd0O\xa7@\xbd\x8f\xc4G\x96T\xf4" 200 25564

Assistant: It wasn't a valid HTTP-request. You could get similar log entry doing something like telnet youserver 80 and then Entering 'HELLO'. I guess there's some index.php at the root of your server?
