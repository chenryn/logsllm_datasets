Hellfire Security
Overview
What is it?
Exploiting it!
Fixing it!
Moving Forward
Wrapping Up
Modern Day Networks
Vendor Dependent
Difficult to scale
Complex and Prone to Break
Distributed and Often Inconsistent
Configuration
Uses inflexible and difficult to innovate 
protocols
Unable to Consider Other Factors
… And Good Luck If You Want 
To Change It!
Enter … Software Defined Networking
Separate the Control and Data Plane
Forwarding Decisions Made By a Controller
Routers and Switches Just Forward Packets
Controllers
Programmed with the Intelligence
Full visibility of the Network
Can consider the totality of the network
before making any decision
Enforce Granular Policy
Enter … Software Defined Networking
Switches
Bare-Metal Only
Any Vendor … Hardware or Software
Solves Lots of Problems
Know the State of the Network Rather Than 
Inferring It
Run Development and Production Side-By-Side
More Practical …
Solves Lots of Problems
Less Expensive Hardware
BGP
Maintenance Dry-Out
Customer Egress Selection
Better BGP Security
Faster Convergence
Granular Peering at IXPs
Solves Lots of Problems

How Prevalent Is It Going To Be?
Gartner: 10 critical IT trends for the next five 
years
Major Networking Vendors Have Products or 
Products Planned for SDN
InformationWeek 2013 Survey
60% felt that SDN would be part of 
their network within 5 Years
43% already have plans to put it in
production
So It’s Gonna Be All …
Not Exactly!
Protocol Weaknesses
Encryption and Authentication via TLS
More of a suggestion than a requirement though …
Started Out Good
Heading Backwards
v1.0.0 over TLS
v1.4.0 over TCP or TLS
Protocol Weaknesses
Controllers
Floodlight … Nope
Opendaylight … Supported but not required
Switches
Arista … No
Brocade … Surprisingly, Yes
Cisco … Another, Yes
Dell … No
Extreme … Another, Yes

Just Full Control of the Switch
All Via “dpctl” command-line
tool

Openflow
Centralization Entails Dependency
Dependency Can Be Exploited
How are vendors handing it?
Floodlight
Explored by Solomon, Francis, and Eitan
Their Results … Handling It Poorly
Opendaylight
Unknown but worth investigating
It is Java for God Sake!

Is Anything Outward Facing?
Better Not to Take Anyone’s Word 
for It
Just Find Out for Yourself
Reported
While Data Centers/Clouds are the Killer App for SDN
NIPPON EXPRESS
FIDELITY INVESTMENTS
VMWARE
Starting to see it moving toward the
LAN
Caltech
Cern 
And WAN
Google, NTT, and AT&T
Discovered (Scanning Project)
Service Discovery Ran on Entire Internet
Seeing Both Controllers and Switches
Still Going Through Results Though
Data Collected Full of Noise
Let’s Just Say that I Now Know
Where All the Tarpits Are!
Some Attacks
Small Local Area Network
One Admin Host
Two User Hosts
One Server
One IDS
Attacker will …
Identify Targets
Enumerate ACLs
Find Sensors
Tool
of-map.py
Downloads flows from an Openflow controller
Uses the flows
To identify targets and target services
To build ACLs
To identify sensors
Works with Floodlight and Opendaylight
via JSON
Demonstration
And Some More Attacks …
Small Local Area Network
One Admin Host
Two User Hosts
One Server
One IDS
Attacker will …
Gain Access to the Server
Isolate the Administrator
Hide from the IDS
And Attack the Server
Tool
of-access.py
Modifies flows on the network through
the Openflow Controller
Adds or Removes access for hosts
Applies transformations to their
network activity
Hides activity from sensors
Works with Floodlight and Opendaylight
via JSON
Demonstration
And Some Pwnage …
Sorry Linux Foundation!
Zero-Day Exploit
Opendaylight has other southbound APIs besides Openflow
No Encryption for Southbound Netconf API
No Authentication for Southbound Netconf API
Just Connect and Exchange Messages
XML-RPC
Remember Java?
Boom Goes Opendaylight
And it runs as “Root”
Demonstration
If No Exploit …
Service Not Available or They Fix It
Not to Worry
Password Guess the !!!!!!
Default Password Weak
Strong Passwords Turned Off
No Account Lockout
No SYSLOG Output
Repeat!
Attacker will …
Identify Targets
Enumerate ACLs
Find Sensors
Gain Access to the Server
Isolate the Administrator
Hide from the IDS
And Attack the Server
And Pwn That Network Too!

Available Solutions
For Now
For the Future
For Now
Transport Layer Security
Feasible?
Realistic?
Hardening … Duh!
VLAN … It’s the Network Stupid!
Code Review Anyone?
For the Future
Denial of Service (SDN Architecture)
Network Partitioning
Controller Clustering
Static Flow Entries
Modification (SDN Applications)
Traffic Counters
Respond to Abnormalities
Verification (SDN Operations)
Impact
With this one box, you get everything they have
There is the Obvious
Own Any Data They Own
Control Any Aspect of Their Operation
Control Their Fate
Opens Up A World of
Possibilities
How It Could Go Right
Vendor Independence and ultimately lower cost
Networks that match the application and the 
businesses needs not the other way around
Faster Evolution of the Network
Production-Scale Simulation
and Experimentation
Exchangeable Network Aspects
Dynamic and Truly Active
Defenses
How It Could Go Wrong
Denial of Service
Peer Node
External Node
Selectively Dropping Traffic?
MiTM
Entire Networks
Local Subnets or Hosts
Shadow Operations
Darknets
Uber Admins
Making the Difference
Traditional Means of Securing Controllers Still Apply
Security Needs to Be Part of the Discussion
Until Now … How SDN Can Help Security
But How Secure is SDN?
Analyses being Done
But By Outsiders
Traditional Approach and 2-D
Controller’s Need A Security
Reference and Audit Capability
SDN has the potential to turn the entire Internet 
into a cloud
Benefit would be orders of magnitude above what 
we see now
But there is hole in the middle of it that could 
easily be filled by the likes of the NSA … or 
worse yet, China
Let’s Not Let That Happen
And That Start’s Here
