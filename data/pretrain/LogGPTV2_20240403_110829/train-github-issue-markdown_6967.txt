My goal is to enhance the integration of my Electron application with the desktop environment. Specifically, I would like to enable the following functionalities:
- Copy a file to the clipboard and paste it into the native operating system's file explorer (e.g., Windows Explorer or macOS Finder).
- Drag and drop files between the Electron app and the desktop, as well as between the app and other applications (e.g., Sublime Text).

Currently, the closest solution I have found is by utilizing Chromeâ€™s built-in support for dragging files out to the desktop, as described in this article: [http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/gmail-dragout](http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/gmail-dragout). However, this functionality appears to be limited to the OS file explorer and does not work when dragging files into other applications.

I am opening this discussion to gather ideas and potential solutions from the community. Have any developers already found effective ways to implement these features?
