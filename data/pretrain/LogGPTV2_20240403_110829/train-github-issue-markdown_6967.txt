My use case is to better integrate my Electron app into the desktop
environment. This includes being able to copy a file to clipboard and paste it
to the native OS explorer/finder as well as to drag and drop between the app
and the desktop.
As of today the closest I can get is by leveraging Chrome's own support for
dragging out files to the desktop
(http://www.thecssninja.com/javascript/gmail-dragout). However this support
seems limited to the OS explorer/finder and does not work to drag something
into another application (eg. Sublime).
Opening this issue to gather some ideas how to support this kind of feature
and maybe other developers have found solutions already?
