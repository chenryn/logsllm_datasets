### Crawl Analysis and Peer Reachability

During the crawl, 30%–38% of discovered peers were found to be unreachable. The breakdown of these unreachable peers is as follows: 2%–3% are departed peers, 15%–24% are firewalled, and the remaining 3%–21% are either also firewalled or overwhelmed ultrapeers. However, since Cruiser only needs to contact one end of an edge, it can discover at least 85%–91% of edges. Given that firewalled peers cannot directly connect to each other (i.e., they cannot be located at both ends of a missing edge) and they constitute more than half of the unreachable peers, the actual portion of missing edges is significantly smaller.

### Quantifying Snapshot Accuracy

We rigorously examined the effect of crawling speed and duration on two dimensions of snapshot accuracy: completeness and distortion. Our evaluations [30] revealed the following:
1. **Completeness**: Cruiser captures nearly all ultrapeers and the pairwise connections between them, as well as the majority of connections to leaves.
2. **Distortion**: Both node and edge distortion in captured snapshots increase linearly with the crawl duration.
3. **Accuracy**: Snapshots captured by Cruiser have minimal distortion. For example, we found that two back-to-back snapshots differed by only 4% in their peer populations.

### Data Set

We have captured over 18,000 snapshots of the Gnutella network during the past eleven months (April 2004–February 2005) using Cruiser. Specifically, we collected back-to-back snapshots for several one-week intervals and randomly distributed snapshots at various times of the day to ensure representativeness. In Section 4, we use four of these snapshots to illustrate graph properties of the overlay topology. In Section 5, we use sets of hundreds of back-to-back snapshots to examine how the overlay topology evolves over time.

### Overlay Graph Properties

The two-tier overlay topology in modern Gnutella (and other unstructured P2P networks) consists of ultrapeers forming a "spaghetti-like" top-level overlay and a large group of leaf peers connected to this top-level overlay. We treat individual snapshots of the overlay as graphs and apply different forms of graph analysis to examine their properties, with special attention to the top-level overlay. Throughout our analysis, we compare our findings with similar results from previous studies. However, it is important to note that we cannot determine whether reported differences (or similarities) are due to changes in the Gnutella network or inaccuracies in the captured snapshots of previous studies.

### Implementation Heterogeneity

The open nature of the Gnutella protocol has led to several known (and possibly many unknown) implementations. Determining the distribution of different implementations among participating peers is crucial, as their design choices directly affect the overall properties of the overlay topology. Table 2 presents the distribution of different implementations across discovered ultrapeers, showing that a clear majority of contacted ultrapeers use the LimeWire implementation. Additionally, around 94% of LimeWire ultrapeers use the most recent version of the software available at the time of the crawl. These results reveal that while heterogeneity exists, nearly all Gnutella users run LimeWire or BearShare.

### Node Degree Distributions

#### Top-Level Overlay

Previous studies reported that the distribution of node degree in the Gnutella network exhibited a power-law distribution [23, 2, 7] and later changed to a two-segment power-law distribution [20, 23]. To verify this property for the modern Gnutella network, Figure 3(a) depicts the distribution of node degree among all peers (both unreachable and reachable) in the top-level overlay for the four sample snapshots presented in Table 1. This distribution has a spike around 30 and does not follow a power-law. A key question is to what extent this difference in degree distribution is due to the change in the overlay structure versus errors in captured snapshots by earlier studies.

To examine this, we captured a distorted snapshot using a slow crawler, similar to the 50-connection crawler used in an earlier study [23]. Figure 4(a) shows the degree distribution based on this distorted snapshot, which is significantly more similar to a two-piece power-law distribution. If we further slow down the crawling speed, the resulting snapshots contain a higher degree of edge distortion, and the derived degree distribution looks more similar to a single-piece power-law distribution, as reported by earlier studies [2, 7]. This finding demonstrates that using distorted snapshots captured by slow crawlers can lead to incorrect characterizations of P2P overlays.

Because we were unable to contact every top-level peer, the distribution in Figure 3(a) is slightly biased low, as it does not include all edges. To address this, we split the data into Figures 3(b) and 3(c), which depict the neighbor degree distribution for reachable and unreachable peers, respectively. The data in Figure 3(b) is unbiased, as we successfully contacted each peer and discovered every edge connected to them. The spike around a degree of 30 is more pronounced in this figure. Figure 3(c) presents the observed degree distribution for unreachable top-level peers (i.e., overloaded or NATed). This distribution is biased low, as we cannot observe the connections between pairs of these peers. Many of these peers likely have a true degree closer to 30, with the true distribution likely similar to that in Figure 3(b).

The degree distribution among contacted top-level peers has two distinct segments around a spike in degree of 30, resulting from LimeWire and BearShare's behavior of attempting to maintain 30 neighbors. Peers with higher degrees represent other implementations that try to maintain a higher node degree or rare users who have modified their client software. Peers with lower degrees are those that have not yet established 30 connections. To verify this hypothesis, we plot the mean degree of peers as a function of their uptime in Figure 5. The standard deviation for these measurements is quite large (around 7–13), indicating high variability.

### Conclusion

In summary, our analysis of the Gnutella network reveals significant insights into the reachability, accuracy, and degree distributions of the overlay topology. The use of Cruiser allows for high-quality snapshots, and the observed degree distributions suggest a structured approach to maintaining connections, particularly among LimeWire and BearShare implementations. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of these findings on the overall resilience and performance of the Gnutella network.
