Abstract—Face authentication systems are becoming increas-
ingly prevalent, especially with the rapid development of Deep
Learning technologies. However, human facial information is easy
to be captured and reproduced, which makes face authentication
systems vulnerable to various attacks. Liveness detection is an
important defense technique to prevent such attacks, but existing
solutions did not provide clear and strong security guarantees,
especially in terms of time.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a new liveness
detection protocol called Face Flashing that signiﬁcantly increases
the bar for launching successful attacks on face authentication
systems. By randomly ﬂashing well-designed pictures on a screen
and analyzing the reﬂected light, our protocol has leveraged
physical characteristics of human faces: reﬂection processing at
the speed of light, unique textual features, and uneven 3D shapes.
Cooperating with working mechanism of the screen and digital
cameras, our protocol is able to detect subtle traces left by an
attacking process.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of Face Flashing, we imple-
mented a prototype and performed thorough evaluations with
large data set collected from real-world scenarios. The results
show that our Timing Veriﬁcation can effectively detect the time
gap between legitimate authentications and malicious cases. Our
Face Veriﬁcation can also differentiate 2D plane from 3D objects
accurately. The overall accuracy of our liveness detection system
is 98.8%, and its robustness was evaluated in different scenarios.
In the worst case, our system’s accuracy decreased to a still-high
97.3%.

INTRODUCTION
User authentication is a fundamental security mechanism.
However, passwords,
the most widely used certiﬁcate for
authentication, have widely known drawbacks in security and
usability: strong passwords are difﬁcult to memorize, whereas
convenient ones provide only weak protection. Therefore, re-
searchers have long sought alternative security certiﬁcates and
methods, among which biometric authentication is a promising
candidate. Biometric authentication veriﬁes inherent factors
instead of knowledge factors (e.g., passwords) and possession
factors (e.g., secure tokens). Some biometric-based schemes

have already been proposed. They exploit users’ ﬁngerprints,
voice spectra, and irises. Face-based schemes have become
increasingly widespread because of rapid developments in face
recognition technologies and deep learning algorithms.
However, in contrast to other biometrics (i.e., iris and retina
recognition) that are difﬁcult for adversaries to acquire and
duplicate, human faces can be easily captured and reproduced,
which makes face authentication systems vulnerable to attacks.
For example, adversaries could obtain numerous photographs
and facial videos from social networks or stolen smartphones.
Furthermore, these images can be easily utilized to build facial
models of target individuals and bypass face authentication
systems, beneﬁting from architectural advances in General-
Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and advanced
image synthesizing techniques. Such attacks can be as simple
as presenting a printed photograph, or as sophisticated as dy-
namically generating video streams by using video morphing
techniques.
To counter such attacks, liveness detection methods have
been developed during the past decade. Crucial to such meth-
ods are challenge-response protocols, in which challenges are
sent to the user who then responds in accordance with dis-
played instructions. The responses are subsequently captured
and veriﬁed to ensure that they come from a real human being
instead of being synthesized. Challenges typically adopted in
studies have included blinking, reading words or numbers
aloud, head movements, and handheld camera movements.
However, these methods do not provide a strong security
guarantee. Adversaries may be able to bypass them by using
modern computers and technology. More speciﬁcally, as Li
et al. [17] argued, many existing methods are vulnerable to
media-based facial forgery (MFF) attacks. Adversaries have
even been able to bypass FaceLive, the method proposed by
Li et al. and designed to defend against MFF attacks, by
deliberately simulating the authentication environment.
We determined that the root cause of this vulnerability
is the lack of strict time veriﬁcation of a response. That is,
the time required for a human to respond to a movement
challenge is long and varies among individuals. Adversaries
can synthesize responses faster than legitimate users by using
modern hardware and advanced algorithms. Therefore, previ-
ous protocols could not detect liveness solely on the basis of
response time.
To address this vulnerability, we propose a new challen-
geresponse protocol called Face Flashing. The core proposal
of this protocol is to emit light of random colors from a liquid-
crystal display (LCD) screen (our challenge) and use a camera
to capture the light reﬂected from the face (our response). The
response generation process requires negligible time, whereas
forging the response would require substantially more time.
By leveraging this substantial difference, Face Flashing thus
provides effective security in terms of time.
The security of the Face Flashing protocol is based on two
factors: time and shape. We use linear regression models and a
neural network model to verify each factor, respectively. Our
veriﬁcation of time ensures that the response has not been
falsiﬁed, whereas veriﬁcation of shape ensures that the face
shape is stereo and face-like. By using these two veriﬁcations,
our protocol simultaneously satisﬁes the three essentials of
a secure liveness detection protocol. First, we leverage an
unpredictable challenge, ﬂashing a sequence of effectively
designed, randomly generated images. Second, our responses
are difﬁcult to forge not only because of the difference in time
but also in the effort required to generate responses. In par-
ticular, legitimate users need not perform any extra steps, and
legitimate responses are generated automatically (through light
reﬂection) and instantaneously, whereas adversaries must ex-
pend substantially more effort to synthesize quality responses
to bypass our system. Third, we can effectively verify the
genuineness of responses by using our challenges. Speciﬁcally,
we verify users on the basis of the received responses; for
example, by checking whether the shiny area in the response
accords with the challenge (lighting area in challenges will
always produce highly intensive responses in a local area).
The detailed security analysis and our adversary model are
presented in later sections of this paper.
II. BACKGROUND
In this section, we describe the typical architecture of face-
based authentication systems (Section II-A). Subsequently,
we brieﬂy review attacks and solutions of liveness detection
(Section II-B).
A. Architecture of Face Authentication Systems
A typical architecture of face authentication system is
illustrated in Fig 1. It
is divided into two parts: front-
end devices and the back-end server. The front-end devices
comprises camera and auxiliary sensors such as ﬂash lamps,
microphones. The back-end server contains two main modules:
a liveness detection module and a face recognition module.
When the user commences the authentication process,
the
liveness detection module is initiated and sends generated
parameters to front-end devices (Step 1). Subsequently, the
front-end devices synthesize challenges according to the re-
ceived parameters and deliver them to the user (Step 2). After
receiving the challenges, the user makes expressions, such as
smiling blinking, as responses. The sensors in the front-end
devices capture such responses and encode them (Step 3).
Either in real time or in post processing, the front-end devices
send the captured responses to the liveness detection module
in the back-end server (Step 4). The liveness detection module
gathers all decoded data and checks whether the user is an
actual human being. If so, the liveness detection module selects
some faces among all the responses and delivers them to the
face recognition module to determine the identity of the user
(Step 5).
Contributions. Our paper’s contributions are three-fold:
•
A new liveness detection protocol, Face Flashing.
We propose Face Flashing, a new liveness detection
protocol, that ﬂashes randomly generated colors and
veriﬁes the reﬂected light. In our system, adversaries
do not have the time required to forge responses during
authentication.
Effective and efﬁcient veriﬁcations of timing and
face. By employing working mechanisms of screens
and digital cameras, we design a method that uses lin-
ear regression models to verify the time. Furthermore,
by using a well-designed neural network model, our
method veriﬁes the face shape. By combining these
two veriﬁcation procedures, our protocol provides
strong security.
Implementation of a prototype and evaluations. We
implement a prototype and conduct thorough evalua-
tions. The evaluation results suggest that our method
performs reliably in different settings and is highly
accurate.

B. Attacks and Solutions on Liveness Detection
In recent years, plenty of attacks have been developed
to exploit the ﬂaw that face recognition algorithms cannot
determine whether a photograph taken by the front-end camera
is captured from a real face, even if the recognition accuracy
of some has exceeded human beings. In this study, we divide
attacks into four categories and organize them as a tree, known
as the attack tree, which is displayed in Fig 2. We ﬁrst separate
attacks into two categories: static and dynamic. Static attacks
refer to the use of static objects, such as photographs, plastic
masks, and paper, as well as transformations of these objects
(e.g., folding, creating holes through them, and assembling
them into certain shapes). Attacks using dynamic or partially
dynamic objects are categorized into dynamic branch. Sub-
sequently, we separate attacks into four subcategories: two-
dimensional (2D) static,
three-dimensional (3D) static, 2D
dynamic, and 3D dynamic. The 3D branches refer to attacks
that use stereo objects, including sculptures, silicone masks,
and robots. More precisely, these objects must have notable
stereo characters of human faces, such as a prominent nose,
concave eye sockets and salient cheekbones; otherwise, the
attacks are categorized into 2D branches. Organized by this
attacking tree, a brief review of relative attacks and solutions
is presented below.
Fig. 2: The attacking tree.
In the 2D static branch, photograph-based attacks are
the predominant form of attack. They are easily launched
and effective at compromising primary recognition algorithms.
Tracking eye movement was the ﬁrst method proposed to
counter such attacks. Jee et al. [9] proposed a method for
detecting eyes in a sequence of facial
images. Variations
around the eyes are calculated, and whether the face is real
is determined. Their basic assumption is that blinking and the
uncontrolled movements of pupils are human nature behaviors.
However, this method cloud be compromised by an adversary
wearing a mask with eyeholes. A similar idea exploiting
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) was proposed by Sun et
al. [23]. Its limitation is the same. Subsequently, lip movement
and lip reading methods were developed by Kollreider et
al. [14] for liveness detection. However, their method can also
be fooled using carefully transformed photographs.
To distinguish faces from photographs, Li et al. [16]
leveraged the fact that faces and photographs have different
appearances in frequency space. They conducted 2D Fourier
spectral analysis to extract the high-frequency components of
input images; faces contain more components in the high-
frequency region than do photographs. However, adversaries
can print a high-resolution photograph to bypass this method.
Jukka et al. [18] observed that printed photographs are pix-
elized. That is, a face has more details than a photograph.
Thus, they used a support vector machine (SVM) to extract
microtextures from the input image. Later, Kim et al. [11]
leveraged a more powerful texture descriptor, Local Binary
Pattern (LBP) to enhance performance. They additionally
analyzed the information residing in both the low- and high-
frequency regions. However, all these types of solutions have
a common drawback: low robustness. Motion blur or noise
from the environment impairs their performance. Moreover,
these methods are useless against screen-based attacks [5].
Because of strategies designed to protect against 2D at-
tacks, adversaries have attempted to exploit 3D objects in 3D
static attacks. Thus, researchers have developed novel methods
to defend against
these attacks also. Lagorio, et al., [15]
3
proposed a method to detect 3D facial features. They employed
a two- camera device to ascertain the surface curvature of
the subject seeking authentication. If the surface curvature
is low, the subject is judged to be malicious. Although the
accuracy is almost 100%, the sophisticated device required
is expensive and the computational cost is unacceptable. Fur-
thermore, Wang, et al., [24] leveraged a one-camera, face
alignment algorithm to ascertain 3D shape on the basis that
forged faces are usually ﬂatter than real faces. However, this
method performed unsatisfactorily when applied to spectacle-
wearers because of the limited capability of the face alignment
algorithm.
In response to technological developments, adversaries
must in turn develop more sophisticated attacks. One method
is pasting stereo materials onto photographs. In contrast,
researchers have developed practical and efﬁcient methods to
counter these threats, with the help from developments in
computer vision. The fundamental idea behind these methods
is that adversaries cannot manipulate static objects to simulate
instructed expressions, even if these objects are similar to the
human face. Thus, a common challenge-response protocol has
been adopted, whereby users are asked to make expressions
as the instructions, including happiness, despair, and surprise.
Such systems subsequently compare the captured video with
stored data.
However, more powerful 2D dynamic attacks have been
developed, in which adversaries have exploited advanced deep
learning models and personal computers with powerful pro-
cessors. These attacks work by merging a victim’s facial
characteristics with photographs of the victim and using these
forged photographs to bypass the face recognition algorithm.
Furthermore, even if this operation requires time, adversaries
can prepare photographs beforehand and launch ofﬂine attacks,
sending forged photographs to an online authentication system.
To counter these new 2D dynamic threats, some solutions
have been proposed. Bao et al.. [1] introduced a method
based on optical ﬂow technology. The authors found that the
motions of 2D planes and 3D objects in an optical ﬂow ﬁeld
are the same in translation, rotation, and moving, but not
in swing. They used this difference to identify fake faces.
Unfortunately, two drawbacks undermine this method: ﬁrst, an
