### Future Work
We plan to explore the feasibility of integrating all three biometric modalities—voice, skin conductance, and fingerprint extraction—into a single system, possibly a mobile device, for enhanced authentication. Additionally, we aim to investigate other emotional responses, such as happiness, joy, anger, and sadness, to further strengthen the claim that skin conductance (SC) can effectively combat coercion attacks. This paper does not address the repeatability of the key using the proposed scheme, which will be a focus in future work.

### Guessing Entropy for Skin Conductance

Let \( R \) be the set of rules an attacker can use to reduce the password space from \( S \) to \( S' \). For a rule \( R_i \) with antecedent \( A \) and consequent \( C \):

\[ A = [y_1, \ldots, y_{Ea}] \]
\[ C = [z_1, \ldots, z_{Ec}] \]

where \( Ea \) and \( Ec \) are the elements in the antecedent and consequent, respectively. The process of calculating the new password space from a given one is shown in Algorithm 2. \( S' \) indicates a lower bound for the password space, representing the minimum number of combinations an attacker needs to guess if they have full knowledge of the mappings in the database.

Let \( \Psi \) denote the candidate set and \( \Phi \) be the large itemset. \( \Psi_I \) and \( \Phi_I \) are two-dimensional vectors derived from the rules \( R_1, \ldots, R_I \). Each item in \( \Psi_I \) is a vector of the form \( [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m_{SC}}] \), where \( x_i \in \{0, 1, *\} \) and \( L = |\Psi_I| \). Similarly, each item in \( \Phi_I \) is also a vector of the form \( [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m_{SC}}] \), where \( x_i \in \{0, 1, *\} \) and \( L = |\Phi_I| \).

**Algorithm 2: Reduced Password Space for SC**

```plaintext
1: Φ0 ← [∗, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗, ∗, . . . , ∗]
2: S ← 2^m_{SC}
3: for I = 1 to |R| do
4:   ΨI ← NULL
5:   for J = 1 to L do
6:     if any(ΦI−1[J,y1], . . . , ΦI−1[J,yEa]) == ∗ then
7:       ΨI ← ΨI ∪ split(ΦI−1[J])
8:     else
9:       ΨI ← ΨI ∪ ΦI−1[J]
10:    end if
11:   end for
12:   ΨI ← unique(ΨI)
13:   cnt ← 1
14:   L ← length(ΨI)
15:   for J = 1 to L do
16:     if ΨI[J,yp] == 1 and ΨI[J,zq] == 0 for all q in Ec then
17:       delete(ΨI[J])
18:     else
19:       ΦI[cnt] ← ΨI[J]
20:       cnt ← cnt + 1
21:     end if
22:   end for
23: end for
24: S' ← Φ|R|
```

- **∗** denotes "don't care" and can be assigned 0 or 1.
- The set of rules \( R \) obtained are passed to Algorithm 2 to generate \( S' \).
- \( \Phi0 \) is initialized to \( [∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ . . . ∗] \) and \( S = 2^{m_{SC}} \).

**Functions Used in the Algorithm:**
- **length(ΨI)**: Gives the total vectors in the candidate set \( \PsiI \), i.e., \( |\PsiI| \).
- **any(ΦI[J,y1], . . . , ΦI[J,yEa] == ∗)**: A boolean function that returns 1 if any element in the antecedent is ∗, otherwise 0.
- **split(ΦI[J])**: Generates a new candidate set \( \PsiI \) from a large itemset \( \PhiI−1 \) based on a rule \( RI \). It generates the vectors for \( \PsiI \) such that:
  - Mark \( yi \) if \( \PhiI−1[J,yi] == ∗ \), ∀ \( yi \in [y1, \ldots, yEa] \).
  - Generate all possible combinations of the marked bits; if the total number of marked bits is \( mb \), then the total possible combinations are \( 2^{mb} \).
- **unique(ΨI)**: Returns the unique vectors from \( \PsiI \).
- **delete(ΨI[J])**: Deletes \( \PsiI[J] \) from the candidate set \( \PsiI \).

During the Candidate Itemset Generation, a ∗ in the large itemset triggers a split; 1 and 0 indicate no action. During the Large Itemset Generation, a 1 in a candidate itemset triggers the addition of 1; 0 indicates no action. Throughout the procedure, each time one rule is used, and the sets that do not comply with that rule are omitted to create the new set. The final password space is calculated by computing the total number of vectors that can be generated using \( \Phi|R| \), where \( \Phi|R| \) is the final large itemset generated from the rules \( R1, \ldots, R|R| \).

**Example:**
An example with 5 elements is shown in Table 4, demonstrating how to generate the candidate itemset and the large itemset from 3 rules. The total number of guesses an attacker needs to make is 14, implying the effective number of bits in the new password space is 4, while the original was 5.
