We leave it as our future work. In terms of feasibility, in
future we will also like to see in some possibilities of
building the system (may be a mobile device) with all
three: voice, skin conductance and ﬁngerprint extraction
mechanism to authenticate to the system. Furthermore,
we would like to look into other emotional responses like
happy, joy, anger, sad etc., to make the claim of using
SC in ﬁghting coercion attacks stronger. This paper does
not study the repeatability of the key using the proposed
scheme and is left as a future work.
Acknowledgments We are deeply grateful to Lucas

tion, as well as David Lo for helpful discussions on the
analysis of the password space.

A Guessing Entropy for Skin Conductance
Let R be the set of rules the attacker can use to reduce
the password space from S to S′. So, for a rule Ri
antecedent(A) ⇒ consequent(C)
15
such that, A=[y1, . . . , yEa] and C=[z1, . . . , zEc], where
Ea are the elements in the antecedent and Ec in con-
sequent. The process of calculating the new password
space from a given one is shown in algorithm 2. S′ indi-
cates a lower bound for the password space which shows
the minimum number of combinations an attacker needs
to guess if he has a full knowledge of the mappings in the
database.
Let Ψ denote the candidate set and Φ be the large
itemset, ΨI and ΦI are the two dimensional vectors
derived from the rules R1, . . . , RI . Each item (ΨI
J )
in a ΨI is a vector of the form [x1, x2, . . . , xmSC ], ∀
0 ≤ J ≤ L, where xi ∈ (0, 1, ∗) and L = |ΨI |. Sim-
ilarly, each item (ΦI
J ) in a ΦI is also vector of the form
[x1, x2, . . . , xmSC ], ∀ 0 ≤ J ≤ L, where xi ∈ (0, 1, ∗)
and L = |ΦI |.

∗ denotes don’t care and can be assigned 0 or 1. The
set of rules R obtained are passed to the algorithm 2 to
generate S′. Φ0
1 is initialized to [∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ . . . ∗] and S
= 2mSC . Below is the short description of the functions
used in the algorithm.
• length(ΨI ) - gives the total vectors in the candi-
date set ΨI i.e. |ΨI|.
• any(ΦJ
I (y1, y2, . . . , yEa) == ∗) - a boolean func-
tion
=(1,
0,
(ΦI
J,y1
else
== ∗) ∨ . . . ∨ (ΦI
J,yEa
) == ∗)
16
• split(ΦI
J ) - this function generates a new candidate
set ΨI from a large itemset ΦI−1 based on a rule
RI . It generates the vectors for ΨI s.t.
– Mark yi,
if
[y1, . . . , yEa].
(ΦI−1
J,yi
== ∗), ∀ yi ∈
– Generate all possible combination of
the
marked bits; which implies if total number of
marked bits are mb then total possible com-
binations are 2mb. For e.g. if ΦI
J = [***1*1]
and the rule RI is 1 ⇒ 2, then the result is
([11 ∗ 1 ∗ 1] [10 ∗ 1 ∗ 1] [01 ∗ 1 ∗ 1] [00 ∗ 1 ∗ 1])
• unique(ΨI) - gives the unique vectors from ΨI .
• delete(ΨI
J ) - delete ΨI
J from the candidate set ΨI.
During the Candidate Itemset Generation, a ∗ in the
large itemset triggers a split; 1 and 0 indicates do noth-
ing. However during the Large Itemset Generation a 1 in
a candidate itemset triggers add 1; 0 indicates do noth-
ing. During the whole procedure, each time one rule is
used and the sets which does not comply with that rule
are omitted to create the new set. The ﬁnal password
space is calculated by computing the total number of vec-
tors which can be generated using Φ|R|, where Φ|R| is the
ﬁnal large itemset generated from the rules R1, . . . , R|R|.
An example shown in Table 4 with 5 elements, to how
to generate the candidate itemset and the large itemset
from 3 rules. The total number of guesses which an at-
tacker needs to make is 14 which implies the effective
number of bits in the new password space are 4; original
was 5.
