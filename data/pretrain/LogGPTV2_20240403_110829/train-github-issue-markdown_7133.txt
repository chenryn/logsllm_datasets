This isn't a critical problem :-).
If you accidentally launch a flutter app with `flutter run` and lib/main.dart
is empty the reported error is not "you have an empty lib/main.dart file" but:
"Could not prepare to run the isolate." etc.
I can say from personal experience that this is a little confusing.
