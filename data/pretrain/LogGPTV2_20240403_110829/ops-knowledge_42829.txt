User: Hi im running a subprocess with threads trough a python wrapper and I get the following warning when I use the subprocess module.
"The _posixsubprocess module is not being used,  Child process reliability may suffer if your program uses threads."
What dose this mean?
How can I get rid of it?
Assistant: It could be if you have more than a version of Python in use.
you need to specify the correct version of python to use for each programme.
For example, I need python 3.7 for miniconda, but mendeleydesktop claims for trouble with this version:
also problem with _posixsubproces and its location
so instead of run the program in a phyton enviroment only I use python2.7, and it solve the problem.
Hope it helps.
Cheers,
Flor
