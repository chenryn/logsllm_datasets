**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (Please choose one)

**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):

**Environment:**
- **Cloud provider or hardware configuration:**
- **Operating System** (e.g., from `/etc/os-release`):
- **Kernel** (e.g., `uname -a`):
- **Installation tools:**
- **Other relevant information:**

**Description of the Issue:**
When we call the main function `app.Run(s)`, at the beginning, we obtain the `genericConfig` by:
```go
genericConfig := genericapiserver.NewConfig() // Create the new config
ApplyOptions(s.ServerRunOptions) // Apply the selected options
Complete()
```
Here, we call the function `(c *Config) Complete()`. Subsequently, we get the `master` struct by:
```go
m, err := config.Complete().New()
```
In the `config.Complete()` function, we also call `c.GenericConfig.Complete()`.

**Question:**
Is it possible to remove the latter call to `c.GenericConfig.Complete()`? Is my understanding correct?

**Expected Behavior:**
We should only need to call the function `(c *Config) Complete()` once.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
(Please provide the steps to reproduce the issue as minimally and precisely as possible.)
