**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one):
**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`):
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** :
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release):
  * **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`):
  * **Install tools** :
  * **Others** :
**What happened** :
When we call the main function app.Run(s),at the beginning, we get the
'genericConfig' by "genericConfig := genericapiserver.NewConfig(). // create
the new config  
ApplyOptions(s.ServerRunOptions). // apply the options selected  
Complete() "  
here we call the function "(c *Config) Complete()", and then,we get the struct
master by "m, err := config.Complete().New()",in the function
config.Complete(),we also call "c.GenericConfig.Complete()".  
Maybe we could remove the latter one, is my understanding right?
**What you expected to happen** :
we call the function "(c *Config) Complete()" once
