Abstract—This paper presents ComFASE, a communication
fault and attack simulation engine. ComFASE is used to identify
and evaluate potentially dangerous behaviours of interconnected
automated vehicles in the presence of faults and attacks in
wireless vehicular networks. ComFASE is built on top of OM-
NET++ (a network simulator) and integrates SUMO (a trafﬁc
simulator) and Veins (a vehicular network simulator). The tool
is ﬂexible in modelling different types of faults and attacks and
can be effectively used to study the interplay between safety
and cybersecurity attributes by injecting cybersecurity attacks
and evaluating their safety implications. To demonstrate the
tool, we present results from a series of simulation experiments,
where we injected delay and denial-of-service attacks on wireless
messages exchanged between vehicles in a platooning application.
The results show how different variants of attacks inﬂuence the
platooning system in terms of collision incidents.

I. INTRODUCTION
Connectivity of safety-critical cyber physical systems [1]
has increased drastically leading to the delivery of functions
and features with greater efﬁciency. One such example of these
systems is where vehicles communicate with each other to
alert drivers of upcoming hazards such as slippery road or
obstruction [2]. These systems should be built complying with
a comprehensive set of safety and security requirements. To
this end, they are equipped with fault and intrusion handling
mechanisms to protect the system from hardware and software
faults and cybersecurity attacks.
Testing and veriﬁcation of a system’s capability of handling
faults and attacks is a complex task. It requires a compre-
hensive set of expertise and appropriate tools to discover the
weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the system. Fault and attack
injection is one of the effective testing techniques that is used
to evaluate the system in the presence of faults and attacks.
Faults and attacks can be injected into a system at different
stages of the product development life cycle, e.g., at early
design stages or close to a production. Injections performed
at initial stages [3]–[6] facilitate early discovery of system
weaknesses. This could result in saving time and cost since
late discovery of a weakness could trigger a costly redesign.
Fault and attack injection testing could be performed
in real-world or
in simulation-based test environments.
Simulation-based testing is comparatively low-cost, repro-
ducible and offers high test coverage. Legal bodies such as
UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe)
[7] and automotive OEMs (Original Equipment Manufactur-
ers) are moving towards increasing the use of simulation-based
testing and veriﬁcation of automated driving system (ADS)
[8] together with the real-world testing for validation and
certiﬁcations.
In this paper, we present ComFASE, an open source fault
and attack injection tool for evaluating the impact of vehicle-
to-vehicle (V2V) communication faults and attacks on au-
tomated vehicles in a simulation environment. ComFASE
incorporates two open source simulators: SUMO (a trafﬁc
simulator) [9] and OMNeT++ (a network simulator) [10].
In addition, it requires a vehicular network simulator based
on OMNeT++, such as Veins [11]. ComFASE is capable of
evaluating the impact of communication faults and attacks on
the target vehicle as well as the surrounding trafﬁc. This is
important as previous studies show that a faulty vehicle could
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the behaviour of surrounding vehicles
[12], [13].
To demonstrate the capabilities of ComFASE, we present
the results of experiments where we have injected two types
of cybersecurity attacks, namely delay and denial-of-service
(DoS), into the wireless channel between vehicles, modelled
in the Veins simulator. The target system in these experiments
is a platooning system implemented in the Plexe-veins [14].
We classify the results of the injections based on two
parameters: deceleration proﬁles of all vehicles in the platoon,
and collision incidents. These parameters allow us to measure
implications of the attacks on the system safety through
identiﬁcation of cases where emergency braking or collision
incidents are reported by the target vehicle or the surrounding
trafﬁc. After classiﬁcation of the results, we analyse the ex-
periment outcomes with respect to attack injection parameters,
such as the attack initiation time and duration as well as its
value.

II. BACKGROUND
A. Simulation-based Fault and Attack Injection
Simulation-based fault and attack injection is a test method
that can be used to evaluate safety and cybersecurity attributes
of automated vehicles and is useful for early system design
evaluation when only a model or application prototype is avail-
able. Using this test method, it is possible to perform extreme
test cases which are otherwise difﬁcult to setup in the real
world, costly to perform and can have severe consequences
in terms of property damages or human injuries. SUFI [12],
[13], SAE++ [15] and NETA [16] are some examples of the
simulation tools that implement this test method.
B. IEEE Standards for WAVE Communication
There are many wireless vehicular communication standards
available such as IEEE 802.11 [17], IEEE 802.11p [18], IEEE
802.11p/ITS-5G [19], 4G [20] and 5G [21]. These standards
provide different communication ranges and have applications
within different problem domains.
ComFASE injects faults and attacks in the wireless channel
model of the V2V communication, which is based on realistic
models of the IEEE 802.11p and the IEEE 1609.4 WAVE com-
munication protocols implemented in the Veins (see §II-C).
The wireless channel model represents an analog medium
where the message is transmitted after it
is encoded and
modulated in the physical layer. The need for these standards
arises from the fact that vehicles move with high velocity and
therefore are subject to short and unstable connections [11]
[22].
IEEE 802.11p is an amendment of the IEEE 802.11 standard
to support WAVE for V2V communications. While IEEE
802.11p WAVE only covers the physical and lower layer of
MAC (media access control), IEEE 1609.4 covers upper MAC
layer of the vehicle communication system (see Fig. 1). IEEE
1609.4 [23] represents various components of the WAVE such
as multi-channel communication for radio operations, quality
of services, channel switching and routing.

models implemented in Veins.
C. Simulation Environment
In this paper, ComFASE is conﬁgured to run experiments
with four simulators: OMNet++ v. 5.6.2 (a network simulator)
[10], SUMO v. 1.8.0 (a trafﬁc simulator) [9], Veins v. 5.1
(a vehicular network simulator) [11] and Plexe-veins v. 2.1
(a platooning extension for Veins) [14]. Veins is built upon
OMNeT++ and implements simulation models of the com-
munication standards discussed in §II-B to allow testing and
analysis of vehicular networks and systems. Note, however,
that ComFASE can be conﬁgured to run with other vehicular
network simulators that are build upon OMNeT++. The model
of the platooning system (used as the system under test in
this paper), including vehicle dynamics and a cruise control
model, is implemented in Plexe-veins, which is based on Veins
and SUMO. All these simulators are open source and are
combined to provide a complete simulation environment (see
Fig. 2). Moreover, ComFASE logs detailed trafﬁc simulation
data from SUMO and vehicular network simulation data from
Veins. Examples of data logged are vehicle speed, accelera-
tion/deceleration and position, as well as various other data,
which are used to describe collision incidents.

D. Related Work
Previous studies that investigated the impact of network
attacks on platooning applications include Heijden et al. [24],
Boeira et al. [25], and Iorio et al. [26].
Heijden et al. [24] studied the impact on vehicle behavior
by injecting jamming attacks in the application layer of the
vehicular communication system. They investigated the re-
silience of different vehicle controllers to these attacks. Boeira
et al. [25], however, focused on sybil attacks (falsiﬁcation of
multiple identities), message falsiﬁcation and radio jamming
attacks in the application and network layers. The behaviour
of the targeted vehicle was observed in SUMO.
Iorio et al. [26] injected falsiﬁcation of parameters (such
as position, speed and acceleration) attacks to study a coop-
