power  analysis  of  event-related  design  fMRI  studies  has 
demonstrated  that  80%  of  clusters  of  activation  proved 
reproducible  with  a  sample  size  of  20  subjects  [56].  Another 
study  [55]  found  that  a  sample  size  of  24  gave  an  accurate 
activation  map  with  a  sufficient  level  of  power  (i.e.,  an  80% 
true  positive  rate).  Thus,  the  number  of  participants  tested  in 
our experiments was optimal for event-related studies. 
E.  Related Work 
Our  study  centers  on  phishing  detection  and  malware 
warnings. Most closely relevant to the phishing component of 
our study is the lab study reported by Dhamija et al. [10] with 
22  participants,  which  asked  the  participants  to  distinguish 
between  real  and  fake  web-sites.  Their  results  indicated  that 
users  do  not  do  well  at  this  task  and  make  incorrect  choices 
40%  of  the  time.  Our  behavioral  data  also  yielded  similar 
results.  However,  our  neuroimaging  data  shows  that  users 
exhibit significant brain activation during fake or real website 
identification task. This suggests that although the outcome of 
the participants’ efforts to differentiate between  fake and real 
web sites may not be good (perhaps because they do not know 
what  to  look  for  on  the  sites  to  make  this  decision),  they 
certainly  seem  to  be  making  a  considerable  effort  in  solving 
these puzzles as reflected by their brain activity in appropriate 
brain regions during this decision-making process. 
The only prior study that focuses on malware warnings is a 
very  recent  large  scale  field  study  reported  by  Akhawe  and 
Felt  [11].  This  study  used  modern  browsers’  telemetry 
frameworks 
to  record  users’  real-world  behavior  when 
interacting  with  malware  (as  well  as  phishing  and  SSL) 
warnings.  Unlike  previously  conducted  lab-based  studies  of 
security warnings and security indicators (see below), this new 
study demonstrated that users heed warnings most of the time. 
Specifically,  they  found  that  users  ignore  Chrome’s  and 
  3
Firefox’s  phishing  and  malware  warnings  only  9-23%  of  the 
time,  and  ignored  Firefox’s  SSL  warnings  33%  of  the  time. 
These  results  are  very  much  in  line  with  the  results  of  our 
study,  which  provides  neurological  proof  as  to  the  users’ 
capability to process and heed malware warnings.  
For  over  a  decade,  many  lab  studies  have  focused  on 
different  browser  security  indicators  (passive  indicators,  and 
active warnings for phishing and SSL attacks) [12, 13, 14, 15, 
16,  17].  All  of  these  studies  suggested  that  users  seldom  act 
upon  warnings  and  security  indicators.  (We  refer  to  Akhawe 
and Felt [11] who provide an excellent survey of the results of 
these studies). Akhawe and Felt attributed the stark difference 
in  the  results  of  prior  lab  studies  focusing  on  warnings,  and 
their  own  field  study  of  [11]  mainly  to  the  changes  in  the 
nature of the browser warnings.  
users’ 
behavior  when 
A previous neuroimaging study somewhat relevant to our 
work was performed by Craig et al. [18]. This study aimed at 
understanding 
faced  with 
advertisements,  including  the  level  of  suspicion  aroused  by  
deceptive  advertising.  Their  study  found  precuneus  and 
superior 
temporal  sulcus  activation  while  participants 
processed  different  levels  of  deceptive  stimuli.  This  has 
relevance  to  user-centered  online  security  interactions,  as 
users  may  become  suspicious  when  they  encounter  phishing 
sites or connect to malware-prone websites. While the Craig et 
al  study  points  to  the  cognitive  dangers  associated  with 
moderately  deceptive  materials,  our  phishing  task  presents 
participants with a real life online security scenario where they 
have to determine whether the website is malicious or real.  
There  have  been  other  studies  that  applied  neuroscience 
principles  to  computer  security  problems,  e.g.,  [19,  20,  52, 
53].  Bojinov  et  al.  [19]  proposed  a  neuroscience-inspired 
approach to coercion-resistant authentication. Martinovic et al. 
[20]  explored  the  feasibility  of  side  channels  attacks  with 
commodity brain-computer interfaces. Thorpe et al. [52], and 
Chung  et  al.  [53]  explored  user  authentication  using  EEG 
devices. 
III.  DESGIN OF EXPERIMENTS 
two  experiments,  one 
The in-scanner phase of our within-subjects fMRI study is 
comprised  of 
involving  phishing 
detection and one involving malware warnings. In this section, 
we discuss the methodology, and design and implementation of 
these experiments. Since these experiments were implemented 
using E-Prime [2], we begin by providing an overview of this 
software platform. 
A.  E-Prime Overview 
To  develop  our  fMRI  experiments,  we  used  the  E-Prime 
software  (Psychology  Software  Tools  Inc.,  Pittsburgh).  E-
Prime  is  a  framework  for  designing  and  implementing 
experiments,  and  collecting  the  participant  response  data  and 
exporting this data to different formats for analysis. E-Prime is 
a  suite  of  applications,  namely,  E-Studio,  E-Run,  E-Basic,  E-
Merge  and  E-DataAid,  where  E-Studio 
is  a  graphical 
environment, E-Basic is the scripting language for E-studio, E-
Run  is  for  running  the  environments,  E-Merge is  for  merging 
session  data  files  into  Multi-Session  data  files and  E-DataAid 
is  for  managing  data  [2].  E-Studio  supports  creation  of 
experimental environment.  It consists of:  
and properties. It has drag and drop functionality to use the 
objects from its framework in the experiment. Inline scripts 
can  be  written  in  E-basic  to  control  the  execution  flow  of 
those objects.

2.  frames:  an  event  in  the  experiment  that  includes  text  or

specific order, following a linear time-line. 
As  a  general practice,  while  developing experiments in E-
Prime, one starts with a procedure called Session Procedure. It 
runs  for  a  session and  holds all other  objects  for that  session. 
Instructions,  blocks  and  trials  are  then  included  in  the 
procedure. The time duration of all objects can be fixed as per 
the  requirement  of  the  experiment.  An  MRI  compatible  IFIS-
SA (Invivo Corp., Gainesville, FL) auditory and visual system 
is  available  for  stimulus  presentation  at  the  neuroimaging 
facility  at  our  University.  This  system  consists  of  two 
computers:  one  for  stimulus  presentation  and  another  for 
experimental  control  and  analysis.  A  master  control  unit  is 
used to interface the two computers. We use E-Prime software 
run  on  the  IFIS-SA  system  to  present  visual  and  auditory 
stimuli.  The  visual  display  in  the  magnet  utilizes  an  IFIS-SA 
LCD video screen located behind the head-coil that  is viewed 
through a mirror attached to the radio frequency (RF) coil. The 
auditory  stimuli,  if  any,  are  presented  using  MR-compatible 
pneumatic headphones. The auditory stimuli and video display 
can  be  controlled  using  the  master  control  unit  within  the 
scanner’s control room. MRI compatible response boxes (e.g., 
joysticks  and  button  boxes)  are  available  within  our 
neuroimaging center. The E-Prime IFIS-SA systems record the 
reaction times as well as participant response to each stimulus 
item  presented  to  the  subject  in  the  scanner,  and  creates  data 
files titled e-dat and t-dat. 
The  visual  display  in  the  MRI  scanner  used  in  our 
experiments (Section II.B) had the resolution of 640*480  and 
thus  the  interface  for  all  the  experiments  were  designed  to  fit 
that resolution. Moreover, since E-Prime only supports a 16-bit 
Bitmap  Image  format,  all  snapshots  used  in  the  experiments 
were  converted  to  Bitmap  keeping  the  visual  integrity  of  the 
stimuli intact. 
B.  Phishing and Phishing Control 
Phishing  is  the  act  of  deceiving  people  by  presenting  a 
fake website which looks like a real one. For this experiment, 
we  identified  websites  which  are  popular  among  people,  and 
took the snapshots of the sites’ login pages. We modified the 
login  pages  of  these  websites,  created  fraudulent  replications 
of them and took snapshots of them. The snapshots were then 
categorized  into  two  types:  “real”  and  “fake.”  The  fake 
website  snapshots  were  further  divided  into  two  categories: 
“easy” and “difficult.” The easy  sites are those  for  which  we 
modified  both  the  URL  and  the  logo  of  the  companies; 
keeping  the  layout  of  webpages  intact;  or  we  changed  the 
  4
URL of the webpages to an IP address. The difficult sites were 
those  for  which  we  modified  just  the  URL  keeping  the 
security icons and parameters intact. Table I provides a sample 
list  of  the  websites  used  in  the  experiment  along  with  their 
URLs. The sites were mainly chosen based on their expected 
popularity  among  our  participants.  Figure  2(a)  and  2(b) 
provide  a  sample  of  how  these  websites  images  looked  for 
easy and difficult trials, respectively. We obtained some of the 
URLs  from  the  website  www.phishtank.com.  The  design  of 
fake  websites,  for  this  experiment,  was  similar  to  the  design 
adopted  in  the  previous  study  on  phishing  detection  reported 
by Dhamija et al. [8].

Figure 2(b): Sample image “easy” (logo and URL different compared to real) 
1)  Experiment  Design  (Phishing):  The  phishing  experiment 
followed  an  event-related  (ER)  design.  In  ER  design,  each 
trial  is  presented  as  an  event  with  longer  inter-trial-interval. 
This  was  done  with  the  goal  of  isolating  fMRI  response  to 
each  item  separately.  Event-related  designs  allow  different 
trials  to  be  presented  in  random  sequences,  eliminating 
potential  confounds,  such  as  habituation,  anticipation,  set,  or 
other  strategy  effects  [51].  In  this  experiment,  we  had  39 
trials, out of  which 3 trials (presented at the beginning of the 
experiment)  were  considered  as  practice  trials  to  familiarize 
the  subjects  with  the  task.  During  the  task,  the  subjects  were 
asked to determine whether a given snapshot of a website was 
“fake” or “real.” 
In  addition  to  trials  involving  real  and  fake  websites,  the 
experiment  had  a  fixation  baseline  condition,  each  of  which 
lasted  for  10s.  Fixations, 
in  the  context  of  an  fMRI 
experiment, are short blocks of time when the participants are 
asked to look at a cross on the screen and relax. Fixations are 
considered  as  windows  of  baseline  brain  activity.  Each  trial 
displayed a  website snapshot  for 6s  followed by a  gap of  6s. 
There were 12 trials involving “easy” fake websites, 13 trials 
involving “difficult” fake websites, and 14 trials involving real 
websites.  The  experiment  started  with  the  set  of  instructions 
followed  by  a  fixation  for  10s,  and  after  every  6  trials,  a 
fixation of 10s was displayed on the screen. Thus, there was a 
fixation  at  the  beginning  of  the  experiment,  at  the  end,  and 
after  every  6  trials.  The  trials  were  presented  to  each 
participant  in  a  randomized  order  and  the  participants  had  to 
express whether the site depicted in the snapshot was “real” or 
“fake”  by  pressing  the  designated  button.  We  recorded  the 
response given by users and the corresponding response time. 
2)  Experiment  Design  (Phishing  Control):  The  phishing 
control  experiment  was  designed  as  a  control  for  the  stimuli 
presented  in  the  phishing  experiment.  This  experiment  was 
identical  to  the  phishing  experiment,  except  that  participants 
were  instructed  to  just  look  at  the  images  displayed  on  the 
screen,  and  not  to  engage  in  an  active  task.  Thus,  this 
experiment  had  all  the  visual  demands  of  the  phishing 
experiment  except  for  the  decision-making  (real  or  fake 
website)  aspect.  In  this  experiment,  20  snapshots  of  login 
pages of different websites, including: Citibank, USPS, orkut, 
hi5,  6pm.com,google,  bankofAmerica, 
  LinkedIn,  chase, 
instagram,  coupons,  spotify,  onlineshoes,  Hotmail,  BestBuy, 
yahoo,  discover,  AT&T,  and  Apple  and  a  portal  of  our 
University, were shown to the participants. In this experiment,  
we  were examining the brain responses  when users  were just 
looking at the webpages, and we subtracted those signals from 
the signals we captured from the phishing experiment.
