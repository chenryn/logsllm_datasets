### Power Analysis and Sample Size Justification

Power analysis of event-related fMRI studies has shown that 80% of activation clusters are reproducible with a sample size of 20 subjects [56]. Another study [55] found that a sample size of 24 participants provides an accurate activation map with sufficient power, achieving an 80% true positive rate. Therefore, the number of participants in our experiments is optimal for event-related designs.

### Related Work

Our study focuses on phishing detection and malware warnings. The most relevant prior work to the phishing component of our study is the laboratory experiment by Dhamija et al. [10], which involved 22 participants. This study asked participants to distinguish between real and fake websites, and their results indicated that users made incorrect choices 40% of the time. Our behavioral data also yielded similar results. However, our neuroimaging data shows significant brain activation during the task of identifying fake or real websites. This suggests that although participants may not perform well in differentiating between fake and real websites (possibly due to a lack of knowledge about what to look for), they are making considerable cognitive efforts, as evidenced by their brain activity in appropriate regions during the decision-making process.

The only prior study focusing on malware warnings is a recent large-scale field study by Akhawe and Felt [11]. This study used modern browsers' telemetry frameworks to record users' real-world behavior when interacting with malware, phishing, and SSL warnings. Unlike previous lab-based studies, this new study demonstrated that users generally heed warnings. Specifically, they found that users ignore Chrome's and Firefox's phishing and malware warnings only 9-23% of the time, and ignored Firefox's SSL warnings 33% of the time. These results align with our study, which provides neurological evidence of users' ability to process and heed malware warnings.

For over a decade, many lab studies have focused on different browser security indicators, including passive indicators and active warnings for phishing and SSL attacks [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. These studies suggested that users seldom act upon warnings and security indicators. Akhawe and Felt [11] attribute the stark difference in the results of prior lab studies and their own field study to changes in the nature of browser warnings.

A somewhat relevant neuroimaging study was conducted by Craig et al. [18], which aimed to understand users' behavior when faced with advertisements, including the level of suspicion aroused by deceptive advertising. Their study found precuneus and superior temporal sulcus activation while participants processed different levels of deceptive stimuli. This has relevance to user-centered online security interactions, as users may become suspicious when encountering phishing sites or connecting to malware-prone websites. While the Craig et al. study points to the cognitive dangers associated with moderately deceptive materials, our phishing task presents participants with a real-life online security scenario where they must determine whether a website is malicious or real.

Other studies have applied neuroscience principles to computer security problems. For example, Bojinov et al. [19] proposed a neuroscience-inspired approach to coercion-resistant authentication. Martinovic et al. [20] explored the feasibility of side-channel attacks with commodity brain-computer interfaces. Thorpe et al. [52] and Chung et al. [53] explored user authentication using EEG devices.

### Design of Experiments

The in-scanner phase of our within-subjects fMRI study consists of two experiments: one involving phishing detection and another involving malware warnings. In this section, we discuss the methodology, design, and implementation of these experiments. Since these experiments were implemented using E-Prime [2], we begin by providing an overview of this software platform.

#### A. E-Prime Overview

To develop our fMRI experiments, we used E-Prime software (Psychology Software Tools Inc., Pittsburgh). E-Prime is a framework for designing and implementing experiments, collecting participant response data, and exporting this data to different formats for analysis. E-Prime includes several applications: E-Studio, E-Run, E-Basic, E-Merge, and E-DataAid. E-Studio is a graphical environment, E-Basic is the scripting language for E-Studio, E-Run is for running the experiments, E-Merge is for merging session data files into multi-session data files, and E-DataAid is for managing data [2].

E-Studio supports the creation of experimental environments and includes:
1. **Interface**: A combination of toolbox, workspace, and structure.
2. **Frames**: Events in the experiment that include text or images.
3. **Trials**: Collections of frames that form stimuli.
4. **Blocks**: Collections of trials.
5. **Procedures**: Used to arrange frames, trials, and blocks in a specific order, following a linear timeline.

As a general practice, developing experiments in E-Prime starts with a Session Procedure, which runs for a session and holds all other objects for that session. Instructions, blocks, and trials are then included in the procedure. The time duration of all objects can be fixed as per the experiment's requirements. An MRI-compatible IFIS-SA (Invivo Corp., Gainesville, FL) auditory and visual system is available for stimulus presentation at our University's neuroimaging facility. This system consists of two computers: one for stimulus presentation and another for experimental control and analysis. A master control unit interfaces the two computers. We use E-Prime software run on the IFIS-SA system to present visual and auditory stimuli. The visual display in the magnet utilizes an IFIS-SA LCD video screen located behind the head-coil, viewed through a mirror attached to the radio frequency (RF) coil. Auditory stimuli, if any, are presented using MR-compatible pneumatic headphones. The auditory stimuli and video display can be controlled using the master control unit within the scannerâ€™s control room. MRI-compatible response boxes (e.g., joysticks and button boxes) are available within our neuroimaging center. The E-Prime IFIS-SA systems record reaction times and participant responses to each stimulus item presented in the scanner, creating data files titled e-dat and t-dat.

The visual display in the MRI scanner used in our experiments (Section II.B) had a resolution of 640x480, and the interface for all experiments was designed to fit this resolution. Additionally, since E-Prime only supports a 16-bit Bitmap Image format, all snapshots used in the experiments were converted to Bitmap, maintaining the visual integrity of the stimuli.

#### B. Phishing and Phishing Control

Phishing involves deceiving people by presenting a fake website that looks like a real one. For this experiment, we identified popular websites and took snapshots of their login pages. We modified the login pages, created fraudulent replications, and took snapshots of them. The snapshots were categorized into "real" and "fake." The fake website snapshots were further divided into "easy" and "difficult" categories. Easy sites had both the URL and the logo modified, or the URL changed to an IP address, while difficult sites had only the URL modified, keeping security icons and parameters intact. Table I provides a sample list of the websites used in the experiment along with their URLs. The sites were chosen based on their expected popularity among our participants. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) provide samples of how these website images looked for easy and difficult trials, respectively. Some URLs were obtained from the website www.phishtank.com. The design of fake websites in this experiment was similar to the design adopted in the previous study on phishing detection reported by Dhamija et al. [8].

**Figure 2(a):** Sample image of a "difficult" trial (URL different compared to real).

**Figure 2(b):** Sample image of an "easy" trial (logo and URL different compared to real).

**1. Experiment Design (Phishing):** The phishing experiment followed an event-related (ER) design, where each trial is presented as an event with longer inter-trial intervals. This was done to isolate the fMRI response to each item separately. Event-related designs allow different trials to be presented in random sequences, eliminating potential confounds such as habituation, anticipation, set, or other strategy effects [51]. In this experiment, we had 39 trials, with 3 initial practice trials to familiarize subjects with the task. During the task, subjects were asked to determine whether a given snapshot of a website was "fake" or "real."

In addition to trials involving real and fake websites, the experiment included a fixation baseline condition, each lasting 10 seconds. Fixations, in the context of an fMRI experiment, are short blocks of time when participants are asked to look at a cross on the screen and relax. Fixations serve as windows of baseline brain activity. Each trial displayed a website snapshot for 6 seconds, followed by a 6-second gap. There were 12 trials involving "easy" fake websites, 13 trials involving "difficult" fake websites, and 14 trials involving real websites. The experiment started with a set of instructions followed by a 10-second fixation, and after every 6 trials, a 10-second fixation was displayed. Thus, there was a fixation at the beginning, end, and after every 6 trials. The trials were presented to each participant in a randomized order, and participants had to express whether the site depicted in the snapshot was "real" or "fake" by pressing the designated button. We recorded the responses and corresponding response times.

**2. Experiment Design (Phishing Control):** The phishing control experiment was designed as a control for the stimuli presented in the phishing experiment. This experiment was identical to the phishing experiment, except that participants were instructed to just look at the images displayed on the screen without engaging in an active task. Thus, this experiment had all the visual demands of the phishing experiment except for the decision-making (real or fake website) aspect. In this experiment, 20 snapshots of login pages from various websites, including Citibank, USPS, Orkut, Hi5, 6pm.com, Google, Bank of America, LinkedIn, Chase, Instagram, Coupons, Spotify, OnlineShoes, Hotmail, BestBuy, Yahoo, Discover, AT&T, and Apple, as well as a portal of our University, were shown to the participants. We examined the brain responses when users were just looking at the webpages and subtracted those signals from the signals captured in the phishing experiment.
