ATT&CK ID:M0814
ATT&CK Technique Name:Static Network Configuration
ICS environments typically have more statically defined devices, therefore minimize the use of both IT discovery protocols (e.g., DHCP, LLDP) and discovery functions in automation protocols. [9] [10] Examples of automation protocols with discovery capabilities include OPC UA Device Discovery  [11], BACnet  [12], and Ethernet/IP. [13]
