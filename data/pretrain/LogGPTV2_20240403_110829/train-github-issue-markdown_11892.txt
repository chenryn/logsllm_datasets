I need to implement object permission in my application. I can handle this in
each endpoint but it will lead to a lot of duplicated code.
For example:
    @router.get(...)
    def read_item(..., item_id: int, ...):
        item = service.get_item(id=item_id)
        if item.owner_id != current_user.id:
            raise NotOwnerException
        ...
This is a simple scenario.  
Is there a way to handle object permission without having to repeat code,
maybe using dependencies injection?  
I will need in some way to pass item_id to the dependency but I think that
it's not possibile.  
Has anyone found a viable solution?
I could also create a function like this:
    def check_permission(item: Item, current_user: User)
        ...
and call this function in each endpoint, but it doesn't seem a very elegant
solution.
What do you think?
