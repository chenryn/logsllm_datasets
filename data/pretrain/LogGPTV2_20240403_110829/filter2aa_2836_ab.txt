‘Un-sweded’
To modify the tuning slugs you will need 5 brass 8-32 Acorn nuts. These run about $2 
for packs of 4. Verify they do not overlap the tuning slugs before purchase. You may 
need to use 6-32 nuts instead if this is the case. You will also need some kind of non-
flammable and non-heat sinking support structure, such as a glass ashtray or ceramic 
tile. 
Remove the tuning slugs from the helical coil assembly. Remove the retaining nuts and 
set them aside. 
One at a time, modify the slugs. Pre tin the bottom of the slug using the silver solder. It 
just needs a light coat. Do not spill any on to the threads. 
While holding the acorn nut with needle nose pliers, tin the bottom with the solder. Put 
an extra dab in the center of the nut to help with adherence later. Touch the iron to the 
slug, the nut to the iron. Heat both the bottom of the slug and the nut to the point where 
fumes just start to appear, Remove the heat and attach the nut to the bottom of the 
slug. Check the centering while the solder is still melted. 
You could also use a small butane pencil torch. Tin the nut and slug as above and then 
place the nut on the slug cold. Heat the slug with the torch, circling the assembly evenly. 
Be careful not to discolor the metal.
Wait approx 30 seconds for the solder to solidify and with the pliers place the assembly 
on a sponge to finish cooling. Clean off the solder flux with a rag and some denatured 
alcohol, isopropyl works if it is what you have. Cleaner is better here.
When done you should have something that looks like this:
At this point you should be able to make the receiver tune to at least -110dBm (0.7uV) 
for 12dB SINAD, -113dBm (0.5uV) typical. Skip ahead to tuning if this is good enough 
for you otherwise continue down this surface mount path of doom!
The stock image rejection filter attenuates 3dB at 145 MHz, Not too good for Amateur 
range applications. Too much is different on the boards to simply change the 
component values. The G1 board uses a low pass image filter instead of a high pass 
one. Of course we could just remove the filters but that would offer no image rejection 
and selectivity would take a hit.
It was decided to swap the filter sections on the board between the LO injection and the 
image rejection filters.  This is an improvement in selectivity, However the Injection filter 
no longer has any high frequency attenuation and the low pass frequency is lower as 
well, this could result in a hit in intermod performance. This is compensated by using the 
better G2 low pass filter in the VHF Receiver Synthesizer Module.
New Receiver Configuration
Remove the Receiver Front End Module cover.
This takes lots of patience so bear with me. So you don't lose track of any components, 
swap them one at a time, by the numbers. Remove one component and set it aside, 
remove the opposite and replace where the other goes and replace the first component 
where the other was from.
Swap the following components in this order: 
•
C10 - C24 
•
L11 - L19 
•
C9 - C23 
•
C8 - C22 
•
L10 - L18 
•
C7 - C21 
•
C6 - C20 
•
L9 - C19 (read text below) 
The pads need to be altered to make L9 fit at C19. Scrape some solder mask from the 
ground plane. The old C19 is placed at C6 with some solder mask scraped to make a 
new ground plane.
Some traces need to be cut with an X-Acto knife. Cut the trace between the old L9 
position and ground and the trace between L9 and R7. Scrape off the solder mask and 
tin new landing areas for the additional components.
Remove L17 and C18 and place them on the set of pads formerly occupied by L9. 
Place C17 between the pad of the new location of L17 and C18 and ground.
Using wire jumper lead from a resistor, make a floating set of L16 and C16 in parallel. 
Attach one side to L17, C18, C17 junction and the other to the trace coming from R7.
To compensate for the additional 2dB of loss in the new image rejection filter, Remove 
R8 and replace with C15. Remove R7 and replace with a wire jumper.
Attach a wire jumper from the inductor at C19 to the pad at old L16.
Clean solder flux with rag and alcohol.
Replace the module cover and proceed with tuning.
Phase 5: VHF Receiver Front End Module Tuning
Tuning has to be done with the module out of the T/R frame as there is no way to get 
tools and your hand in there at the same time, I’ve tried. So perform the following 
connections.
RF Input to Spectrum Analyzer Tracking Generator Output
IF Output to Spectrum Analyzer RF Input
LO Output to LO Input via 2’ BNC jumper cable.
Clip lead with +12 (Backplane J5, Pin 3) to L21, C32 Junction. You may have to add a 
wire jumper to make a connection point on the Front end depending on revision of 
board you have, and care should be taken not to short J5.
Once that is done set the following on the Spectrum Analyzer, Center frequency = 
Receive frequency, Span 10 MHz, Track Generator +0dBm, 10dB per division.
To get close, start with only the first slug, the one closest to the RF Input jack. Replace 
the retention nut on the slug and insert back into the helical casting. Tighten down the 
nut until the slug moves at the desired tension. Take the cable feeding the SA Input and 
hold it to the next hole in line and tune the first slug until the peak is at the center range. 
The signal should be -70 to -50dB down from +0dBm.
Repeat procedure with following slugs advancing to next set of holes. Adjust for best 
flatness at the top of the graph.
When on the last slug, set the tracking generator to output -30dBm and connect SA 
Input back to LO Output of Receiver Front End Module.  Readings are now 
approximately 35dB down from the input. Adjust the last slug for maximum level, then 
proceed to adjust L1-L5 for best possible response. The response should be tuned to 3 
MHz wide at the 3dB points. 
To test for conversion gain, set Spectrum Analyzer center frequency to 21.4 MHz. 
Offset the tracking generator so the output sweeps the center receiver frequency 
(146.04 MHz – 21.4 MHz = 124.64 MHz). The level of 21.4 MHz spike should be within 
1dB of tracking generator output signal (-30dBm).
Phase 6: T/R Frame
Replace modules in T/R frame in following order Left to Right.
Large cards:
Transmit Synthesizer Module
Receiver Synthesizer Module
Receiver Front End Module
Receiver IF Module
Small Cards:
System Module
Blank
Blank
Blank
Power Module
Note, that some stations may have accessory cards in the blank areas.
Connect service monitor with SINAD measuring ability to RF Input and take a 
connection from the station speaker for audio. Verify Receiver comes to factory 
specification of -116dBm (0.35uV), mine comes to -118dBm (0.28uV), be sure to add 
cable loss into your figures.
External controller interfacing may be done following the instructions here:

Phase 7: VHF Power Amplifier
Please Refer to LBI38531A
The circuitry for the VHF Amplifier and Low Pass Filter is perfect, don’t mess with it. 
Connect the output from the Transmit side of the T/R frame to the input of the Power 
Amplifier.  In MASTRUTL.BAT from the Potentiometer screen adjust Power Output to 
99. 
Unscrew the Low Pass Filter and lid from the PA assembly. Connect a Bird 43 with a 
suitable dummy load and 250W 125-250MHz slug or equivalent to the output connector 
of the LPF. Key the repeater. Adjust the potentiometer on the Power Amplifier board 
until 135W is indicated on the meter, mine is labeled ‘R217’.  Adjust the Power Output 
value in the software until the desired power level is achieved.
Reattach the lid and Low Pass Filter and reassemble the repeater.
