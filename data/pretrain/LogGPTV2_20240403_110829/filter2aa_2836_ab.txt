### Un-Sweding the Tuning Slugs

#### Materials Needed
- 5 brass 8-32 Acorn nuts (approximately $2 for a pack of 4)
- Non-flammable and non-heat-sinking support structure (e.g., glass ashtray or ceramic tile)
- Silver solder
- Needle-nose pliers
- Small butane pencil torch (optional)
- Sponge
- Denatured alcohol or isopropyl alcohol
- Rag

#### Instructions

1. **Verify Fit:**
   - Ensure the 8-32 Acorn nuts do not overlap the tuning slugs. If they do, use 6-32 nuts instead.

2. **Remove Tuning Slugs:**
   - Detach the tuning slugs from the helical coil assembly.
   - Remove the retaining nuts and set them aside.

3. **Modify the Slugs:**
   - Pre-tin the bottom of each slug with silver solder. Apply a light coat and avoid spilling solder on the threads.
   - Hold an acorn nut with needle-nose pliers and tin the bottom with solder. Add an extra dab in the center to enhance adherence.
   - Heat both the bottom of the slug and the nut until fumes just start to appear. Remove the heat and attach the nut to the bottom of the slug. Check the centering while the solder is still melted.
   - Alternatively, use a small butane pencil torch. Tin the nut and slug as described, place the nut on the slug cold, and heat the slug evenly with the torch. Be careful not to discolor the metal.

4. **Cooling and Cleaning:**
   - Allow the solder to solidify for about 30 seconds.
   - Place the assembly on a sponge to finish cooling.
   - Clean off the solder flux with a rag and some denatured alcohol or isopropyl alcohol.

5. **Final Configuration:**
   - The modified receiver should now tune to at least -110dBm (0.7uV) for 12dB SINAD, typically -113dBm (0.5uV).

### Image Rejection Filter Modification

#### Stock Performance
- The stock image rejection filter attenuates 3dB at 145 MHz, which is suboptimal for amateur radio applications.

#### Improvement
- Swap the filter sections between the LO injection and the image rejection filters. This improves selectivity but may affect intermod performance.
- Use the better G2 low pass filter in the VHF Receiver Synthesizer Module to compensate for this.

### New Receiver Configuration

1. **Remove the Receiver Front End Module Cover:**
   - Exercise patience and swap components one at a time to avoid losing track.

2. **Component Swapping:**
   - Swap the following components in order:
     - C10 ↔ C24
     - L11 ↔ L19
     - C9 ↔ C23
     - C8 ↔ C22
     - L10 ↔ L18
     - C7 ↔ C21
     - C6 ↔ C20
     - L9 ↔ C19 (modify pads and traces as needed)

3. **Pad and Trace Modifications:**
   - Scrape some solder mask from the ground plane to fit L9 at C19.
   - Place the old C19 at C6, scraping solder mask to create a new ground plane.
   - Cut traces with an X-Acto knife and scrape off solder mask to tin new landing areas.
   - Remove L17 and C18, placing them on the pads formerly occupied by L9.
   - Place C17 between the pad of the new location of L17 and C18 and ground.
   - Use a wire jumper lead to make a floating set of L16 and C16 in parallel.
   - Attach one side to the L17, C18, C17 junction and the other to the trace coming from R7.
   - Replace R8 with C15 and R7 with a wire jumper.
   - Attach a wire jumper from the inductor at C19 to the pad at the old L16.

4. **Clean Up:**
   - Clean solder flux with a rag and alcohol.
   - Replace the module cover and proceed with tuning.

### VHF Receiver Front End Module Tuning

1. **Setup:**
   - Connect RF Input to Spectrum Analyzer Tracking Generator Output.
   - Connect IF Output to Spectrum Analyzer RF Input.
   - Connect LO Output to LO Input via a 2’ BNC jumper cable.
   - Clip lead with +12V (Backplane J5, Pin 3) to L21, C32 junction. Add a wire jumper if necessary and avoid shorting J5.

2. **Spectrum Analyzer Settings:**
   - Center frequency = Receive frequency
   - Span = 10 MHz
   - Track Generator = +0dBm
   - 10dB per division

3. **Tuning Procedure:**
   - Start with the first slug closest to the RF Input jack. Replace the retention nut, insert the slug back into the helical casting, and tighten the nut.
   - Hold the cable feeding the SA Input to the next hole in line and tune the first slug until the peak is at the center range. The signal should be -70 to -50dB down from +0dBm.
   - Repeat for subsequent slugs, advancing to the next set of holes and adjusting for best flatness at the top of the graph.
   - For the last slug, set the tracking generator to output -30dBm and connect SA Input back to LO Output of the Receiver Front End Module. Adjust the last slug for maximum level, then adjust L1-L5 for the best possible response. The response should be tuned to 3 MHz wide at the 3dB points.

4. **Conversion Gain Test:**
   - Set the Spectrum Analyzer center frequency to 21.4 MHz.
   - Offset the tracking generator so the output sweeps the center receiver frequency (146.04 MHz – 21.4 MHz = 124.64 MHz).
   - The level of the 21.4 MHz spike should be within 1dB of the tracking generator output signal (-30dBm).

### T/R Frame Assembly

1. **Module Placement:**
   - Large cards (Left to Right):
     - Transmit Synthesizer Module
     - Receiver Synthesizer Module
     - Receiver Front End Module
     - Receiver IF Module
   - Small cards (Left to Right):
     - System Module
     - Blank
     - Blank
     - Blank
     - Power Module

2. **Verification:**
   - Connect a service monitor with SINAD measuring ability to the RF Input and take a connection from the station speaker for audio.
   - Verify the receiver meets factory specifications of -116dBm (0.35uV). My setup achieves -118dBm (0.28uV); ensure you account for cable loss.

### External Controller Interfacing

### VHF Power Amplifier

1. **Circuitry:**
   - The VHF Amplifier and Low Pass Filter are optimal; do not modify them.
   - Connect the output from the Transmit side of the T/R frame to the input of the Power Amplifier.
   - In MASTRUTL.BAT, adjust Power Output to 99.

2. **Adjustment:**
   - Unscrew the Low Pass Filter and lid from the PA assembly.
   - Connect a Bird 43 with a suitable dummy load and 250W 125-250MHz slug or equivalent to the output connector of the LPF.
   - Key the repeater and adjust the potentiometer on the Power Amplifier board until 135W is indicated on the meter (labeled ‘R217’).
   - Adjust the Power Output value in the software to achieve the desired power level.
