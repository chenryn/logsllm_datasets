Question: "A system administrator needs to adjust the security settings on an Intel-based Mac with an Apple T2 Security Chip to meet specific operational requirements. The administrator must enable the Mac to boot from a network volume despite not being able to verify the SSV volume root hash and to accept boot arguments that are not on the built-in allow list. Which System Integrity Protection (SIP) policy bits should the administrator change using csrutil or bputil from 1TR?"
 "A": "Set sip0 to disable SIP and downgrade to Permissive Security."
 "B": "Set sip1 to true, allowing iBoot to skip verifying the SSV volume root hash."
 "C": "Set sip2 to true, to lock the CTRR hardware register."
 "D": "Set sip3 to true, to bypass the boot-args NVRAM variable allow list."
