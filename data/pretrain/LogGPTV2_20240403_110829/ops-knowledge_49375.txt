User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Which logs will Plesk deal with? I'm about to move to a VPS server running CentOS 6 and the latest version of Plesk. I've been told to look into logs and log rotation - which I know Plesk supports - but it has been mentioned that Linux may have several logs that are not covered by it, for instance the mail log and the server access log.

So really, what I'd like to know is which logs won't be covered by Plesk? But also is there something better I should use/install to manage all the logs? 

Thanks in advance. By the way, you may have guessed but I'm completely new to VPS.

Assistant: Plesk uses own logrotate binary(check rpm -qa | grep logrotate), which uses following config /usr/local/psa/etc/logrotate.conf and configs from /usr/local/psa/etc/logrotate.d/

All other logs are not covered.
