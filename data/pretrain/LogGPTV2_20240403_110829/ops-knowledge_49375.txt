**Question:**
I am planning to migrate to a VPS server running CentOS 6 with the latest version of Plesk. I have been advised to look into log management and log rotation, which I understand Plesk supports. However, it has been mentioned that Linux may have several logs that are not managed by Plesk, such as the mail log and the server access log.

Could you please clarify which logs Plesk will handle and which ones it will not? Additionally, is there a better tool or method I should consider for managing all the logs on my VPS?

Thank you in advance. By the way, I am completely new to VPS.

**Answer:**
Plesk uses its own `logrotate` binary, which can be verified using the command `rpm -qa | grep logrotate`. The configuration for Plesk's log rotation is located in `/usr/local/psa/etc/logrotate.conf`, and additional configuration files can be found in `/usr/local/psa/etc/logrotate.d/`.

Plesk primarily manages the following logs:
- Plesk application logs
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) logs
- Mail server (Postfix/Dovecot) logs
- FTP server logs

However, Plesk does not cover all system logs. Some logs that Plesk does not manage include:
- System-level logs (e.g., `/var/log/messages`, `/var/log/syslog`)
- Security logs (e.g., `/var/log/secure`)
- Cron job logs (e.g., `/var/log/cron`)
- Custom application logs

For comprehensive log management, you might consider using additional tools such as:
- **rsyslog**: A powerful and flexible logging system that can handle a wide range of log types.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: A popular solution for centralized logging, searching, and visualization.
- **Graylog**: Another robust option for log management and analysis.

These tools can help you aggregate, monitor, and analyze all logs on your VPS, providing a more complete and unified view of your system's activity.

If you need further assistance with setting up these tools or any other aspects of your VPS, feel free to ask.

Best regards,
