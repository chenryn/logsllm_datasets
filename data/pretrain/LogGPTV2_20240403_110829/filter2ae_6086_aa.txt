SAML began in 2001, and the final version of SAML 2.0 was released in 2005.
Since then, no major version has been released. SAML 2.0 has continued to the
present. Nowadays, SAML is outdated, and OAuth is used more in SSO. I have
seen some SAML vulnerability reports on some vulnerability platforms, and it
still appears in some large application products. A recent topic, "Hacking the
Cloud With SAML"[[1]](https://drive.google.
com/file/d/1p1tTTIjg3RoJecYSU3CetvNw6-ZZdMXn/view), also mentioned that
archaeological study is still worthwhile, at least some of its concepts are
still in use.
### SAML 2.0
**SAML** : Security Assertion Markup Language，a language for security
assertion markup。
SAML application：
  * SSO Single Sign-ON
  * Federated Identity
  * Use SAML within other architectures such as WS-Security
Subsequent content is mainly part of SAML SSO.
Three parties in the SAML protocol：Browser, IDP(Identity Provider)，SP(Service
provider), and the communication sequence, encryption method, and transmission
data format of these three parties.
The basic authentication process is as follows：
Just take a rough look at the flow chart, and you will see the details of each
link in the OpenSAML case later.
### See the SAML SSO authentication process through the OpenSAML request
package
**OpenSAML** is an open source implementation of the SAML protocol. I found an
SSO [demo](https://github.com/OpenConext/Mujina) implemented with OpenSAML in
github, using HTTP-POST to transmit SAML, there are Hundreds of stars. Run the
project and log in normally to see the complete communication package process.
Port 9090 is SP, and port 8080 is IDP.
