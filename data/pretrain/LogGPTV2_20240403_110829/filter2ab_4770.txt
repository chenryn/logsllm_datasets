**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Supply Chain Management

A robust supply chain management program should incorporate methods to assess the trustworthiness and technical maturity of suppliers. Additionally, it should include technical measures, such as code-signing and a bill of materials, to validate the integrity of newly acquired devices and components. Develop procurement language that clearly outlines the expectations for suppliers, including the provision of artifacts, audit records, and technical capabilities necessary to ensure the integrity of the supply chain.

### Key Components:
- **Supplier Assessment:**
  - Evaluate the trustworthiness and technical maturity of suppliers.
- **Technical Validation:**
  - Implement code-signing and maintain a detailed bill of materials to verify the integrity of new devices and components.
- **Procurement Language:**
  - Clearly specify the requirements for suppliers to provide artifacts, audit records, and technical capabilities needed to validate the supply chain's integrity.

By integrating these elements, organizations can enhance their supply chain security and reduce the risk of compromise.
