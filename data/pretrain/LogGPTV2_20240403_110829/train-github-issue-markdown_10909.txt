Hi All
i dont't know if there is something wrong with my confing or it is a bug but
in WSL and linux boxes connected via ssh when pasting clear text from notepad,
Windows Terminal after each line, leaves one empty line. I am pasting using
right click.
It does not happen on cmd.exe or PowerShell
Anybody know how to resolve that?
Thanks
