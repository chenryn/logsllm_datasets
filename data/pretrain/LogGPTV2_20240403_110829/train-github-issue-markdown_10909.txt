Subject: Issue with Extra Line Breaks When Pasting Text in WSL and SSH via Windows Terminal

Hello All,

I am experiencing an issue with pasting plain text from Notepad into WSL and Linux machines connected via SSH using the Windows Terminal. After each line, an extra empty line is being added. I am pasting the text using a right-click.

This problem does not occur when using `cmd.exe` or PowerShell.

Has anyone encountered this issue before, or know of a way to resolve it?

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
