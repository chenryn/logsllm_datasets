User: How to identify and deal with security threats, such as hacker attacks, virus infections, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Use anti-virus software: first of all, install the industry-leading anti-virus software and keep it updated at all times. This can effectively prevent virus infection and reduce threats. 2. Create strong passwords: Passwords are the first line of defense for all data on your computer. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that strong passwords are established and constantly changed. Also, don't reuse the same passwords across systems. 3. Stay away from phishing: Don't let hackers use social engineering to lure you into your cyberspace. This includes notifications sent via email, text message or social media, which may appear to be very real. 4. Do not download software or open files from unfamiliar links: Before downloading software or opening any file, always check its source and trustworthiness. 5. Continuous monitoring of the security environment: Use intelligent security monitoring software to quickly detect, track and contain any security issues. 6. Educate users: Educate employees about threats and new fraud tactics in a timely manner, so that they can better identify and respond to security threats. 7. Timely backups: Back up your data regularly and store it in another location so that you can restore it quickly if you encounter a problem. In this case, data loss will be minimized. As in all work, the key is to remain vigilant and never place too much faith in any unknown source.
