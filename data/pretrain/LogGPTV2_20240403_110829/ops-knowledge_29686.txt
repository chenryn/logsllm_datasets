User: I have a folder with about 220,000 text files. I need to open them in a certain order, and do something with the content. At the moment, I just use open, and it takes, on average, about half a second to open a file. Is there any faster way to do it?
If it matters - I'm on Windows.
Assistant: This is a problem of the underlying file system. Use a file system that is better suited for large amount of files. Built a directory tree, sort the files into directories after the first, second, third ... character of the filename.
