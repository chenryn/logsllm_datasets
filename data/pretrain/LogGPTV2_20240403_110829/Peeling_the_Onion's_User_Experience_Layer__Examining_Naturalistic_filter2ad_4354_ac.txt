### User Experience (UX) Issues with the Tor Browser

#### Navigation and Search Quirks
- **Participant Feedback:** "I encountered an issue, and I am unsure if it was due to Tor or DuckDuckGo. When using StackOverflow for coding help, clicking the back button redirected me to the main Tor page instead of the search results. This was frustrating as I had to retype my query and search again." – (P6, F, 22, write-up)
- **Search Results Perception:** Participants had mixed reactions to DuckDuckGo's search results. Some found them useful, while others felt they were less relevant and practical compared to other search engines.

#### Need for Operational Transparency and Learning
- **Participant Feedback:** "There is a need for greater operational transparency and educational content via Tor messaging and communication, designed to be accessible to non-experts. Clearer information is needed in several contexts: motivating Tor use, explaining Tor functionality, and clarifying errors."
- **Understanding Anonymity:** Many participants lacked a comprehensive understanding of how Tor achieves anonymity and why online anonymity is important. Some believed Tor was only useful in countries with restricted freedom of expression, not seeing its benefits in the United States.
- **Prior Research Echoes:** These findings align with previous studies, which indicate that non-experts often have simplistic mental models of Tor's operation and the threats it mitigates [13].

#### Technical Confusion
- **Participant Feedback:** "I wish the study had explained the difference between Tor and a VPN service like HideMyAss or TunnelBear. Despite searching, I still do not understand the exact differences." – (P4, F, unspecified age, write-up)
- **Error Messages and Jargon:** Several participants encountered error messages filled with technical jargon, which they found confusing. For example, some reported unresponsive websites and did not understand why the Tor Browser could not access sites that worked fine on other browsers.
- **Specific Example:** "At home, the Tor browser refused to launch and displayed a 'proxy server is refusing connections' message. I was unable to determine the cause, and no web pages would load." – (P10, M, 20, write-up)

#### Trust and Reliability
- **Impact on Trust:** The lack of a smooth and polished UX led some participants to associate these issues with a general lack of trustworthiness and reliability.
- **Educational Aspects:** Some participants found the Tor Browser to be a learning experience, with warnings about threats to anonymity, such as HTML5 canvas data and window maximization.
- **Circuit Information:** Many participants found the circuit information, which shows the path of their connection, to be well-presented and informative.
- **Reduced Trust:** Unreliability and frequent issues reduced trust, leading some to feel less secure than with other browsers.

#### Benefits and Positive Aspects
- **Ease of Installation and Privacy:** Participants appreciated the ease of installing the Tor Browser and enjoyed the anti-tracking, ad-free browsing experience.
- **Anonymity and Privacy:** Many participants reported a strong sense of anonymity and privacy, which they found desirable.
- **Example Feedback:** "Using the Tor browser, I felt good and unique, able to browse the internet without concern of being watched or surveilled. It gave me more liberty and discretion in visiting web pages." – (P8, M, unspecified age, write-up)

### Discussion and Implications

#### Broken Functionality and Latency
- **Frequent Issues:** Broken functionality and latency were the most common and frustrating issues. Causes were often unclear, and users received no explanatory warnings or errors.
- **Possible Causes:** Issues can arise from blocked JavaScript, server timeouts, plugin dependencies, and Tor traffic blocks. Users may incorrectly conclude that the Tor Browser is buggy and unreliable.
- **Latency Challenges:** Latency is an inherent tradeoff in anonymity systems. Research and outreach efforts aim to improve access speeds, but latency remains a UX challenge.
- **Solution:** Inform users about potential causes for broken functionality and latency. Provide clear, jargon-free explanations and reminders that latency is a necessary part of ensuring anonymity.

#### Inconvenience
- **Common Features Missing:** The Tor Browser lacks features like password managers, bookmarks, and history, which make browsing convenient and efficient.
- **Security vs. Convenience:** While these features can compromise privacy and security, their absence can deter new users who find the browser inconvenient.
- **Solution:** Modify the security slider settings to allow users to choose between convenience and security, and conduct further research on the potential effects of including these features.

By addressing these issues, the Tor Browser can enhance user satisfaction and adoption, ensuring that more people can benefit from the privacy and security it provides.
