F, 20, write-up)
“I did run into a quirk, and I do not know if this was due
to Tor or DuckDuckGo. I use StackOverFlow to get help on
coding problems and whenever I clicked back it took me to the
main page of Tor and not to the list of search events. This
was very frustrating because I had to retype my query and
look for it again.” – (P6, F, 22, write-up)
The reaction to DuckDuckGo’s search results was mixed;
some participants liked the results while others found them
to have lower relevance and utility compared to those from
other search engines.
Participants expressed a need for promoting greater oper-
ational transparency and facilitating learning via Tor mes-
saging and communication designed to be accessible to non-
experts. The need for greater and clearer information was
perceived in a number of contexts: motivating Tor use, de-
scribing Tor functionality, and explaining errors.
Many participants lacked appropriate understanding of
how Tor achieved the anonymity it promises and why and
when online anonymity is important and useful. For instance,
some participants believed that Tor was useful only in coun-
tries where freedom of expression is limited, but did not see
any benefit to using it in the United States. These findings
echo the results of our prior work which pointed out that
non-experts typically hold simplistic mental models regarding
Tor operation and the threats it counters [13].
“One thing I really wish would be explained at the beginning
of the study is the difference between Tor and a VPN service,
like HideMyAss or TunnelBear. I tried Googling it (or in
the case of the past week, DuckDuckGoing it) but I still do
not understand exactly what differentiates them.” – (P4, F,
unspecified age, write-up)
Several participants ran into situations in which they were
puzzled by why the Tor Browser was performing specific
operations or encountered error messages full of jargon that
they did not comprehend. For instance, many of those who
reported unresponsive Web sites stated that they did not
understand why the Tor Browser was not able to access sites
that seemed to pose no problems for other browsers.

unsure of the cause of this message, but no Web pages would

one participant, the Tor Browser solved an SSL certificate
issue, potentially preventing a Man-in-the-Middle attack.
Error messages were often unhelpful for troubleshooting.
The error message referred to in the above quote by P10,
for example, is full of jargon and could have been caused as
a result of any one of multiple problems, such as a lack of
Internet connectivity or the failure to launch the Tor daemon.
Similar lack of clarity was mentioned regarding messages
encountered in a number of situations.
“For some reason, a few days before the study started, the
laptop started tweaking, saying that it did not trust the cer-
tificates for [some] sites and would not let me navigate to
them. It was incredibly frustrating, but when I accessed the
same sites via Tor once the study began, there were no error
messages and I could go straight to the sites with no issues.”

“I went to launch Tor and it got stuck on the ‘loading relay
information’ part of connecting. It said ‘this may take sev-
eral minutes’ but it ended up never connecting.” – (P4, F,
unspecified age, write-up)
4.6 Lack of Trust
Importantly, qualitative analyses showed that the lack of a
“smooth and polished” UX caused more than mere frustration;
it led some participants to associate the problems with a
general lack of trustworthiness and reliability.
Several participants perceived using the Tor Browser as a
learning experience. For instance, some Tor Browser warnings
made them aware of threats to anonymity they had not
previously considered, such as HTML5 canvas data, window
maximization, etc.
“I really enjoyed that when you resize the Tor window, it
notifies you that, while you may choose to do so, it actually
makes your device more vulnerable. I had no idea that this
was an issue and was very pleased that Tor let me know this.”
– (P11, F, unspecified age, write-up)
“I experienced only two Web sites crashing but it lessened my
trust in regards to the reliability of the Tor browser.” – (P10,
M, 20, write-up)
Similarly, participants found it illuminating to consult the
circuit information, which many felt was well-presented and
useful.
“This was not always the case but its unreliability also made
me not trust the Tor service as much.” – (P1, M, 22, write-up)
The reduced trust further led to feelings of less security
compared to other browser alternatives, thus defeating the
central promised benefit of Tor.
“...it felt less secure and smooth than the official browsing
options (Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Chrome, etc).” –
(P10, M, 20, write-up)
4.7 Benefits
On a positive note, qualitative analyses revealed several as-
pects of the Tor Browser participants deemed beneficial and
enjoyable. For instance, participants appreciated that the
Tor Browser was easy to install and enjoyed the anti-tracking
advertising-free browsing experience in the Tor Browser. For
“One really cool tool that Tor offers is the map of where the
IP address is being rerouted — seeing that the circuit is being
bounced around back and forth to other countries.” – (P1, M,
22, write-up)
“I loved that I was able to see the circuit that the browsing
session was being routed through and how it bounced around
different countries.” – (P5, F, 19, write-up)
Notably, when using the Tor Browser, many participants
reported an overall feeling of anonymity and privacy which
was typically characterized as desirable.
“Upon starting to use the Tor browser, it felt pretty good and
unique to be able to browse the Internet without concern of
being watched or surveilled, I felt like I had more liberties and
discretion in what Web pages I visited without the concern of
surveillance.” – (P8, M, unspecified age, write-up)
5 DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Our naturalistic approach was able to uncover a number of
UX considerations that were not noted in previous studies
of Tor use carried out in the laboratory where the settings
and the study designs imposed constraints on the tasks and
the time. In the following subsections, we discuss the most
salient UX insight derived from our findings and apply it
to suggest solutions to tackle the corresponding issues and
improve the Tor Browser UX.
5.1 Broken Functionality and Latency
Although Broken Functionality and Latency were the most
frequently encountered and the most frustrating for our par-
ticipants, the causes behind the issues were often unknown or
unclear. Participants experienced that the site did not load or
function as expected but received no explanatory warnings or
errors from the Tor Browser. There are, of course, a number
of possible reasons behind broken site functionality within
the Tor Browser, such as blocked JavaScript, server time
outs, dependencies on plug-ins, Tor traffic blocks, etc. The
reasons remain opaque since users merely experience that
the site failed to operate as desired. Moreover, it is typically
unclear to users that many of the issues arise due to the
mechanisms needed to provide anonymity or restrictions on
Tor imposed by external parties. As a result, users may in-
correctly conclude that the Tor Browser is buggy, unreliable,
and ineffective compared to alternate browsers. For example,
two of our participants were unable to view PDF files. We
suspect that the problem arose because of the specifics of
the PDF generation and serving mechanisms used by the
sites involved. However, in the absence of any information
regarding why the files could not be viewed, the participants
assumed that the Tor Browser could not handle PDF files.
In anonymity systems such as Tor, there is an inherent
tradeoff between anonymity and latency. Much research is
devoted to improving access speeds over the Tor network,
mostly addressing traffic routing, and the Tor Project engages
in outreach aimed at growing the number of volunteer-run
relays in order to boost available resources, thus helping
reduce latency. Despite these efforts, latency remains a UX
challenge. Additional research on sophisticated approaches
that alleviate traffic congestion in the Tor network [1–4,
14, 20, 23, 25] may provide noticeable speed improvements.
Such approaches involve improved path selection that avoids
overloading nodes and fixing the slowness induced by TCP
mechanisms, such as head-of-the-line blocking. It may also
be fruitful to explore whether the UDP protocol could be
incorporated to help reduce latency.
Solution: Inform users about potential causes for
broken functionality and latency. Perhaps the most straight-
forward way to address broken functionality is informing users
why a Web site does not work with Tor. If the Tor Browser or
a browser extension blocks content, users should be able to
determine what was blocked and understand why. Of course,
such explanatory information must avoid jargon and technical
detail that non-experts may not follow.
A similar approach could be used for latency as well. For
example, until a page loads, the Tor Browser could explain
latency within a local page that is replaced when the desired
page is ready to be rendered (i.e., HTTP 200 is received).
Another possibility is to measure Round-Trip Time (RTT)
between the client and the exit node by having the exit
node acknowledge a Tor cell. If the RTT is above a specified
threshold, the user could be alerted that higher latency should
be expected as long as RTT remains high. As recommended by
Norcie et al. [32], it may be useful to remind users that latency
is an artifact of anonymity protection. As mentioned earlier,
our participants were more willing to tolerate slower speeds
when they understood those as necessary to benefit from
the anonymity offered by onion routing. It is important that
such messages are delivered unobtrusively, avoiding invasive
techniques like pop-ups that are likely to be dismissed as an
annoyance.
Solution: Provides means to generate Tor-friendly
pages. In order to facilitate content delivery in a manner that
fits the constraints imposed by the Tor Browser, content and
site developers could be encouraged to support ‘Tor-friendly’
versions of Web pages. To that end, tools could developed
to analyze Web pages and provide a Tor-friendliness rating
along with a list of actionable suggestions that could be im-
plemented to improve the rating. Web sites are often built on
top of content management systems (CMS), such as Word-
press, that use templates and plug-ins with features that may
not work within the Tor Browser. A potential solution is to
provide plug-ins and templates that function in a Tor-friendly
manner. For example, a Wordpress login plug-in could be
built to handle user authentication without requiring the use
of JavaScript. Further, existing CMS plug-ins could be tested
and certified as Tor-friendly if they meet the appropriate cri-
teria. These suggestions, however, involve addressing several
challenges. First, ‘Tor-friendliness’ needs to be defined and
measured. Second, content and service providers must be
encouraged and incentivized to adopt the tools and provide
Tor-friendly versions. Third, the tools will need to work in
conjunction with other mechanisms that can get around Tor
traffic blocks or other forms of Tor censorship.
5.2 Inconvenience
Many users have come to rely on common browser features,
such as password managers, bookmarks, history, session track-
ing, cookies, etc., that make browsing convenient and effi-
cient. The amnesiac property of the Tor Browser forgoes such
features in order to provide protection against certain ad-
versaries, especially those that could potentially gain access
to the user’s machine. Against other adversaries, however,
a lack of these features creates an inconvenience with no
benefit. That said, as our participants correctly discerned,
implementation of some of these features could potentially
compromise privacy and security. For instance, password
managers with lax auto-fill policies have been shown to intro-
duce attacks that otherwise would not have been possible [38].
Additionally, lenient treatment of cookies could cause Web
activities to be tracked. More research is needed to determine
the potential effects of including these convenience features
in the Tor Browser. Such features are particularly important
for novices, who often begin using the Tor Browser out of
curiosity [13]; inconveniences may make them give up using
the Tor Browser before they have had the chance to learn
and experience its benefits.
Solution: Modify the security slider settings to al-
