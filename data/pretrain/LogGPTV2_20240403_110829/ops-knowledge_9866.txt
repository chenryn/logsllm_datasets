Question: "In a code review, a team member suggests using a 'volatile' keyword for a shared counter variable to ensure thread safety in a multithreaded web application. Which of the following is the most compelling counterargument to this suggestion?"
 "A": "The 'volatile' keyword only ensures that the value of the variable is always read from the main memory, but it does not provide atomicity for read-modify-write operations."
 "B": "The 'volatile' keyword will significantly degrade the application's performance due to the increased overhead of synchronization."
 "C": "The 'volatile' keyword is not supported in the web application's programming language."
 "D": "Using 'volatile' is the best practice for ensuring thread safety and there are no compelling counterarguments."
Answer: A
