User: How to install Tomcat and add services on a Windows server?
Assistant: The steps are as follows: 1. Download and install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java Development Kit (JDK), and ensure that the JAVA_HOME variable is set in the system environment variable. 2. Download the Tomcat server and decompress it to a local directory. Download address of the latest version of Tomcat: https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi. 3. Open the "cmd" command line window in the /bin folder under the Tomcat installation directory, and execute the "service.bat install" command to install Tomcat as a Windows service. If it has been installed, execute the "service.bat remove" command to remove Tomcat from the Windows service. Note: The cmd window must be opened with administrator privileges. 4. Configure the user account and password when the Tomcat service starts, which can be customized by selecting the Tomcat service in the Windows service. 5. Start or stop the Tomcat server through the Tomcat service control in the Windows service. 6. Open the browser and enter http://localhost:8080. If you see the Tomcat welcome page, it means the installation is successful.
