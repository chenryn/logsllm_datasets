(a) Inconsistent event duration distribution
(b) Inconsistency duration across preﬁxes
Figure 6: iBGP data analysis of several peers with AT&T
AT&T chose a route through a customer rather than a peer. Overall,
two-thirds of AT&T’s peers never had more than ﬁve inconsistent pre-
ﬁxes at time.
Our analysis in Figure 6 focuses on ﬁve of the remaining peers; Peer
3 corresponds to the same peer analyzed in Section 4.1. At any given
time, at most a few hundred preﬁxes have inconsistent advertisements.
Figure 6(a) shows the distribution of inconsistency duration for ﬁve
peers, excluding the large number of events that persist for less than
one second due to transient routing changes. The peers exhibit varying
degrees of inconsistency. Peer 4, for instance, has signiﬁcantly longer
inconsistency events; in fact, this peer advertises more than 100 pre-
ﬁxes inconsistently for the entire duration of our study. Figure 6(b)
shows the distribution of time for which the preﬁxes each peer adver-
tised are inconsistent. About 20% of the preﬁxes advertised by Peer 4
are inconsistent more than 30% of the time. For the other peers, only
10% of preﬁxes advertised from any other were ever advertised incon-
sistently, and more than 90% of the preﬁxes were consistent at least
99% of the time.
To quantify the impact of routing inconsistencies, we analyzed the
trafﬁc destined to inconsistent preﬁxes using Netﬂow data collected
from the border routers. We focused on the ten most inconsistent pre-
ﬁxes per peer and all preﬁxes that were inconsistent for the entire one-
day period. The inconsistencies corresponded to less than 1% of the
preﬁxes and less than 0.5% of the trafﬁc leaving AT&T via the peering
links. Although the inconsistencies involve small amounts of trafﬁc,
some can cause signiﬁcant trafﬁc diversions: one neighbor ISP failed
to advertise 30 preﬁxes at ﬁve separate locations for the entire duration
of the trace. In our future work, we plan to analyze the trafﬁc directed
to speciﬁc peers (such as Peer 4) in more detail and analyze longer
traces.
5. How Bad Routes Can Come From Good Peers
Although a peer may intentionally violate the “consistent export”
requirement, inconsistencies may be inadvertent. For example, a peer
might mistakenly have minor differences in its export policies, such
as ﬁltering small subnets at one location and not another. However,
applying the same export policy at each peering point does not guar-
antee consistent advertisements. In this section, we present three cases
where an AS might not advertise consistent routes to its peer, even
though the AS applies consistent export policies. Because we see nei-
ther the missing route nor the conﬁguration of the neighboring AS, we
cannot determine what caused the inconsistency (or even whether it
was accidental), but there are at least three plausible explanations for
unintentional inconsistencies:
Missing iBGP session: Each router in an AS selects a single best route
for each preﬁx from the routes learned via iBGP and eBGP neighbors.
In the simplest scenario, the peer AS has a “full mesh” iBGP conﬁg-
uration with a BGP session between each pair of routers. However, a
conﬁguration mistake may lead to a missing iBGP session, as shown
by the dashed line between routers 1 and 4 in Figure 7(a). As a re-
sult, router 3 receives a BGP route to d but router 4 does not, leading
the peer to advertise the preﬁx at one peering point but not the other.

Figure 7: Peer AS conﬁgurations that lead to inconsistent route export, despite consistent export policy. Router 3 has a small intradomain path cost to router
1, and router 4 has a small intradomain path cost to router 2.
A similar conﬁguration mistake could also cause the peer to advertise
routes with different AS path lengths, if one router learns a short route
and another learns a longer route.
Although it might appear that a missing iBGP session is a pathologi-
cal case of misconﬁguration that would be quickly caught by a network
operator, it turns out that missing iBGP sessions are fairly common,
and can go unnoticed for some time. For example, in Figure 7(a), the
destination remains reachable, so an operator might not immediately
notice that router 4 does not have complete routing information. Addi-
tionally, larger ASes often use more complicated iBGP topologies in-
volving route reﬂection [3]; in these cases, ensuring a fully connected
iBGP topology is more subtle than ensuring a full mesh. Recent work
that analyzes errors in BGP conﬁguration has discovered that missing
iBGP sessions occur reasonably often [4].
Customer-driven export: Many ASes allow a customer to tag a BGP
route with community attributes that inﬂuence the handling of the
route [5, 6]. For example, a customer might be allowed to use the “no
export” community [5] to instruct the provider not to export the route
to neighboring ASes (e.g., to control its incoming trafﬁc, the customer
might advertise a subnet of a larger preﬁx to its immediate provider
but not require that subnet to be propagated further). If the customer
connects to the provider in multiple locations, one route might have
this tag and another might not, as shown in Figure 7(b). The two cus-
tomer routes look “equally good,” leading routers 3 and 4 to select the
closest egress point (routers 1 and 2, respectively). Even if the two
routers apply the same export policy, router 3 would export the route
but router 4 would not. Similarly, an AS might allow its customers
to assign a community that triggers “AS prepending” when a route is
exported, which could lead the AS to export routes with different AS
path lengths.
Mix of customer and peer routes: An AS may learn routes for a pre-
ﬁx from multiple neighboring ASes. In Figure 7(c), router 1 learns a
route from a customer and router 2 learns a route from a peer. Suppose
the routes have the same AS path length and that the import policies
assign the same local preference to both routes. Then, routers 3 and
4 would receive two “equally good” routes (i.e., with the same local
preference and AS path length). Each router would select the route
with the closest egress point, leading router 3 to select a customer-
learned route and router 4 to select a peer-learned route. However,
an AS typically does not export a route learned from one peer to an-
other [7]. Even if routers 3 and 4 apply exactly the same export policy
(i.e., “export only customer routes”), router 3 would export a route to
d but router 4 would not, leading the local AS to receive a route to the
preﬁx at one peering point and not the other. We recently discovered
that this very problem was discussed on the North American Network
Operators Group (NANOG) mailing list seven years ago [8].
Designing tools for detecting these kinds of conﬁguration errors and
policy conﬂicts would be very useful for preventing unintentional vio-
lations of the “consistent export” requirement.
6. Conclusion and Future Work
Contractual peering agreements often require that two ASes adver-
tise consistent routes at all peering points. Today, ASes can use the
algorithm that we propose in Section 3 to detect inconsistent route
advertisements from neighboring ASes, as long as the AS’s import
policies satisfy the conditions we proposed. We note that, for load bal-
ancing purposes, import policies that set local preference values based
on AS path length, rather than on speciﬁc ASes in the path, allow the
inference algorithm in Section 3 to be applied. Although import poli-
cies based on AS path length usually provide sufﬁcient ﬂexibility for
performing trafﬁc engineering [9], import policies based on AS path
length are occasionally insufﬁcient. In cases where an AS must use
these types of import policies, detection of inconsistent route adver-
tisements requires complete access to all of the eBGP routes adver-
tised from that peer; router vendors should add support for monitoring
all eBGP-learned routes learned by an AS’s border routers.
The algorithms we propose can also be used in conjunction with
router conﬁguration and iBGP data to validate previous studies on cold
potato routing (e.g., [2]). Cold potato routing must be caused by either
local import policy or inconsistent route advertisements. With access
to an AS’s router conﬁgurations and iBGP routing data, we can verify
these empirical measurements by examining an AS’s import policies
and applying our proposed algorithm for detecting inconsistent route
advertisements. We intend to explore this further in our future work.
