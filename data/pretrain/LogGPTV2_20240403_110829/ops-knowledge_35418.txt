User:  Please explain what a cross-origin request is and how to solve the cross-origin request problem?
Assistant: Cross-domain request means that when a webpage sends an HTTP request to another domain, if the two domains have different sources, the problem of cross-domain request will occur. In other words, the browser's same-origin policy restricts web pages from accessing resources under another domain name. The same origin means that the protocols, domain names, and port numbers are all the same. In order to solve the problem of cross-domain requests, there are several methods: 1. JSONP: use the feature that the src attribute of the <script> tag is not restricted by the browser's same-origin policy, and use the dynamic generation of a script tag in the page, the src attribute Points to the cross-domain address and corresponds to a callback function. When the server returns data, the callback function will be called directly to complete the data processing of the cross-domain request. 2. CORS: Cross-domain resource sharing, adding some HTTP headers to tell browsers to allow cross-domain access. Configured on the server side, you can implement cross-domain requests. 3. Proxy: By setting up a proxy server under this domain name, the cross-domain resource request that needs to be accessed is forwarded to the proxy server, and the proxy server requests the cross-domain resource, and then returns the request result to the browser, and the browser only accesses this domain name Under the server, so as to achieve cross-domain requests. 4. WebSocket protocol: WebSocket is built on the TCP/IP protocol, which is different from the HTTP/HTTPS protocol, so cross-domain requests through WebSocket can circumvent the restrictions of the same-origin policy.
