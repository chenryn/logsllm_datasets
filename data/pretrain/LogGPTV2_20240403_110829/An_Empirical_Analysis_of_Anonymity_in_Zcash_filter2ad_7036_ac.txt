### Analysis of Zcash Shielded Pool Transactions

#### Introduction
This section examines the transactions involving t-addresses and the shielded pool in Zcash. We analyze large deposits and withdrawals, and identify the participants involved, including founders and miners.

#### Large Deposits and "One-Man Wolf Packs"
Two significant deposit spikes are observed in the graph, each corresponding to a single large deposit from unknown t-addresses. These addresses were identified as residing in single-address clusters. For the first spike, many of the deposited amounts originated from a founder address, suggesting a possible association with the founders.

#### Participant Identification
To understand who is using the pool, we associate addresses with the types of participants: founders, miners, and 'other' (services and individual users).

- **Founders and Miners**: According to consensus rules, founders and miners must deposit their block rewards into the shielded pool before further spending. We tagged founders based on Zcash parameters and miners as recipients of coingen transactions that were not founders.
- **t-to-z Transactions**: Founder deposits are identified as t-to-z transactions using one or more founder addresses as input, and miner deposits as t-to-z transactions using one or more miner addresses as input.

The results, shown in Figure 6, indicate that miners are the primary contributors to the pool, accounting for 76.7% of the total deposits. Founders, while contributing less frequently, make large, noticeable deposits.

#### Interactions with the Shielded Pool
Zcash's uniqueness lies in its shielded pool, which we explore by examining deposits (t-to-z) and withdrawals (z-to-t). Over time, 3,901,124 ZEC have been deposited into the pool, and 3,788,889 ZEC have been withdrawn. Figure 5 illustrates these deposits and withdrawals over time.

- **Symmetry in Deposits and Withdrawals**: The figure shows a near-perfect reflection of deposits and withdrawals, indicating that most users withdraw the exact amount they deposited, often very quickly after the initial deposit. This behavior is primarily attributed to founders and miners.
- **Spike Analysis**:
  - **"The Early Birds"**: The first withdrawal spike occurred at block height 30,900, involving a single transaction of 7,135 ZEC (equivalent to 242,590 USD at the time), distributed across 15 t-addresses.
  - **"One-Man Wolf Packs"**: Both deposit spikes correspond to single large deposits from unknown t-addresses, with the first spike involving a founder address.

#### Linking Transactions
We link t-to-z and z-to-t transactions to reduce the anonymity set. Using heuristics, we can identify the following:

- **Miners and Founders**: By applying heuristics, we positively linked most z-to-t activity to miners and founders. Of the 177,009 z-to-t transactions, 120,629 (68%) were associated with miners, capturing 52.1% of the value, and 2,103 (13.5%) were associated with founders.
- **Founder Heuristic**: We identified an automated pattern in founder deposits, typically 249.9999 ZEC, and developed a heuristic to link z-to-t transactions carrying 250.0001 ZEC to founders. This heuristic added 75 more addresses to our initial list of 48 founder addresses.

#### Heavy Users
Figure 7 shows the addresses that have deposited more than 10,000 ZEC into the pool, with miners being the heaviest users. Founders also deposit large amounts but spread them over various addresses. One 'other' address belongs to ShapeShift, and the others belong to untagged clusters.

#### Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the usage patterns of the Zcash shielded pool, highlighting the roles of miners and founders. The heuristics developed help in linking transactions and reducing the anonymity set, providing a clearer picture of pool interactions.
