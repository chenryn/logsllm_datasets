User: I deploy my project to GAE over Github. There is some foreign API-key which I don't want to save in repository and make them public. Is it possible to set an environment variable for a project in GAE control panel so I can catch it in my application?
Assistant: You can store your keys in datastore. Later when you need them in the code, you can fetch them from datastore and cache them by memcache.
