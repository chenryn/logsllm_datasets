I love the Acrylic effect in the new terminal. Really gives it a modern feel.
But at the moment, whenever you focus on a different program, i.e click away
from the terminal, it loses the Acrylic effect and goes to a solid color. I
have two monitors so most of the time, I have my terminal visible on the
second monitor while working in the first and most of the time the terminal is
just a solid black color. Would it be possible to make it so that it keeps the
Acrylic effect or is that a limitation of the UI toolkit?
