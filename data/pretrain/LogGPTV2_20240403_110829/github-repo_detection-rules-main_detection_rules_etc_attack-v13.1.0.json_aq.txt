### DCShadow Mitigation

**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
This type of attack technique is challenging to mitigate with preventive controls because it exploits inherent features of Active Directory (AD) design. For instance, mitigating specific AD API calls can lead to unintended side effects, such as disrupting Domain Controller (DC) replication. Therefore, the focus should be on preventing adversary tools from running earlier in the chain of activity and identifying subsequent malicious behavior.

### New Service Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z  
**Modified:** 2020-01-17T16:45:23.647Z  
**ID:** course-of-  
**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate the creation of new services by unauthorized users:
1. Limit the privileges of user accounts and remediate Privilege Escalation vectors to ensure that only authorized administrators can create new services.
2. Identify and block unnecessary system utilities or potentially malicious software that may be used to create services. Use whitelisting tools like AppLocker, Software Restriction Policies, and other appropriate methods to control software execution.

### SID-History Injection Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z  
**Modified:** 2019-07-25T11:37:35.427Z  
**ID:** course-of-  
**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate SID-History injection:
1. Clean up SID-History attributes after legitimate account migration is complete.
2. Apply SID Filtering to interforest trusts, such as forest trusts and external trusts, to exclude SID-History from requests to access domain resources. SID Filtering ensures that any authentication requests over a trust only contain SIDs of security principals from the trusted domain.
3. Note that SID Filtering of forest trusts is enabled by default but may have been disabled in some cases. SID Filtering of external trusts is automatically enabled on all created external trusts using Server 2003 or later domain controllers.
4. Apply SID Filtering by disabling SIDHistory on forest trusts using the netdom tool and applying SID Filter Quarantining to external trusts using the netdom tool.
5. Applying SID Filtering to domain trusts within a single forest is not recommended as it is an unsupported configuration and can cause breaking changes.

### Data Transfer Size Limits Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z  
**Modified:** 2019-07-24T19:05:56.488Z  
**ID:** course-of-  
**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can use network signatures to identify traffic for specific adversary command and control infrastructure and malware, mitigating activity at the network level. Signatures are often based on unique indicators within protocols and may be tailored to specific obfuscation techniques used by adversaries. Adversaries will likely change tool command and control signatures over time, so continuous updates and monitoring are essential.

### Inhibit System Recovery Mitigation

**Created:** 2019-04-22T13:54:51.385Z

**ID:** course-of-  
**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To prevent the disabling of services or deletion of files involved in system recovery:
1. Implement technical controls to protect critical services and files.
2. Develop and implement IT disaster recovery plans that include regular data backups. Ensure backups are stored off-system and protected from common methods adversaries may use to gain access and destroy the backups.
3. Identify and audit or block potentially malicious software using whitelisting tools like AppLocker, Software Restriction Policies, and other appropriate methods.

### Web Shell Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z  
**Modified:** 2019-07-25T12:34:23.847Z  
**ID:** course-of-  
**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate the use of web shells:
1. Regularly patch externally facing web servers to prevent adversary access through exploitation for privilege escalation or file inclusion weaknesses.
2. Audit account and group permissions to ensure that accounts used to manage servers do not overlap with accounts and permissions of users in the internal network that could be acquired through credential access and used to log into the web server and plant a web shell or pivot from the web server into the internal network.

### Pass the Hash Mitigation

**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate pass the hash attacks:
1. Monitor systems and domain logs for unusual credential logon activity.
2. Prevent access to valid accounts and apply patch KB2871997 to Windows 7 and higher systems to limit the default access of accounts in the local administrator group.
3. Enable pass the hash mitigations to apply UAC restrictions to local accounts on network logon.
4. Limit credential overlap across systems to prevent the damage of credential compromise and reduce the adversary's ability to perform lateral movement between systems.
5. Ensure that built-in and created local administrator accounts have complex, unique passwords. Do not allow a domain user to be in the local administrator group on multiple systems.

### Bypass User Account Control Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z

**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate bypassing User Account Control (UAC):
1. Remove users from the local administrator group on systems. Although UAC bypass techniques exist, it is still prudent to use the highest enforcement level for UAC when possible.
2. Check for common UAC bypass weaknesses on Windows systems to be aware of the risk posture and address issues where appropriate.

### Accessibility Features Mitigation

**Created:** 2018-10-17T00:14:20.652Z

**Type:** course-of-action  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Domains:** enterprise-attack  
**Deprecated:** true  

**Description:**
To mitigate the use of accessibility features for malicious purposes:
1. If remote desktop protocol (RDP) is used, ensure Network Level Authentication is enabled to force the remote desktop session to authenticate before the session is created and the login screen is displayed.
2. Use a Remote Desktop Gateway to manage connections and security configuration of RDP within a network.
3. Identify and block potentially malicious software that may be executed by an adversary using whitelisting tools like AppLocker, Software Restriction Policies, and other appropriate methods.
