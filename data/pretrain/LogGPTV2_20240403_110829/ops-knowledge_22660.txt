User: Does a easy to use Ruby to Python bridge exist?  Or am I better off using system()?
Assistant: I don't think there's any way to invoke Python from Ruby without forking a process, via system() or something.  The language run times are utterly diferent, they'd need to be in separate processes anyway.
