I am new to CentOS and am trying to develop an application on it. For my application, I need to install Python 2.7, but the default version on the server is Python 2.6. In an attempt to upgrade, I accidentally deleted the `/usr/bin/python` folder. After that, I installed Python 2.7 using `make install`. I then recreated the `/usr/bin/python` folder and ran the command `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python`.

However, after this, when I try to run YUM commands, I receive the following error:
```
-bash: /usr/bin/yum: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: Permission denied
```

The permissions for the `/usr/bin/python` directory are as follows:
```
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root 4096 Mar  8 00:19 python
```

I believe the issue is that the YUM script (located at `/usr/bin/yum`) starts with the shebang line `#!/usr/local/bin/python2.6`, which points to a Python binary file, not a directory.
