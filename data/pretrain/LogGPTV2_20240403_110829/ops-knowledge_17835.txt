User: I am new in centos.I am try to do an application on it.For my application I need to install python 2.7.But the default one on server was python 2.6. So tried to upgrade the version .And accidentally I deleted the folder /usr/bin/python.After that I Installed python 2.7 through make install.I created the folder again /usr/bin/python and run command  sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/bin/python.  After this when I tried to run YUM commands I am getting the error 
-bash: /usr/bin/yum: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: Permission denied
drwxrwxrwx 2 root root        4096 Mar  8 00:19 python
this is permission showing for the directory /usr/bin/python
Assistant: this problem is that yum file start head write #!/usr/local/bin/python2.6， write binary file， is not dir， is python binary file
