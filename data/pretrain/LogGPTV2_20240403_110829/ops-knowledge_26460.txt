User:  How to verify that an HTTPS certificate is valid?
Assistant: There are several ways to verify whether an HTTPS certificate is valid: 1. Using a browser: When visiting a website, the browser will check whether the certificate is issued by a trusted authority, and whether the domain name in the certificate matches the currently visited domain name . If the certificate is valid, a lock icon or a green address bar is displayed. 2. Use the command line tool: You can use the openssl command to verify whether the certificate is valid. For example, the following command can check whether a site's certificate is issued by a trusted authority: openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 3. View certificate details: You can open the certificate and view its details, such as the authority, expiration date and more. If the certificate's details appear to be incorrect, the certificate may be forged. Please note that if you are not sure whether some HTTPS certificates are valid or may be forged, please do not go past the security warning and submit sensitive information.
