### Privacy Preservation in Database-Driven CRNs

Recently, the authors of [9] proposed PriSpectrum, a scheme that protects the location privacy of secondary users (SUs) in database-driven cognitive radio networks (CRNs).

**Figure 6: Signal Coverage and Service Contour**
The signal coverage and service contour of KABC-TV, located at (−118.067020°, 34.226950°), with a channel frequency of ch7 and an effective radiated power (ERP) of 28.700 kW, are depicted. From the updated plot, it is evident that the running times grow linearly with the number of channels (K). Dividing the area into fewer squares (i.e., smaller N = n × n) improves the update performance. Importantly, all running times are on the order of seconds due to the absence of cryptographic operations, making them negligible compared to the overall running times of our scheme, which are on the order of minutes.

### C. Performance of Query

#### 1. Our Design vs. Naive Design
We conducted a simulation to compare the query performance of our design with a naive design, using N = 100 × 100. Query requests were randomly generated over the squares. Since the naive query is computationally intensive, we varied Ns from 50 to 300. The experimental results are shown in Figures 7(b) and 7(e).

**Figures 7(b) and 7(e) demonstrate:**
1. **Efficiency Comparison:** Our design is more efficient than the naive design in terms of computation and communication performance when Ns exceeds 100, and the performance gap increases as Ns grows.
2. **Scalability:** Both the running times and message volumes of our design grow much more slowly compared to the naive design.

**Reasons for the Observations:**
1. **Parallelism:** Our design leverages parallelism in multiple query operations, while the naive design's overhead scales linearly with the number of query operations. As the number of parallel query operations increases, our design becomes increasingly more efficient.
2. **Constant Overheads:** When the number of query operations is much smaller compared to the number of squares (N = n × n), our design maintains nearly constant running times and message volumes because the number of tuples being sorted remains almost the same. In contrast, the naive design experiences linear growth in running times and message volumes due to the increasing computational and communication overheads.

#### 2. Large-Scale System Performance
In large-scale systems, the number of SUs (Ns) may be comparable to the total number of squares (N). We evaluated our query performance with N = 100 × 100, varying Ns from 1000 to 10000 for K = 20, 40, and 60, respectively.

**Figures 7(c) and 7(f) show:**
- The running times and message volumes increase with the number of SUs and channels. 

### Conclusion

The authors of [30] developed a location privacy-preserving spectrum auction for database-driven CRNs. However, existing work has not considered the operational privacy of primary users (PUs) or the correctness verification of spectrum database operations. Unlike [9] and [30], which focused solely on protecting SUs' location privacy, our work enables both secure update and query operations, protecting both PUs' operational privacy and SUs' location privacy. Additionally, it ensures the correctness of database operations in the presence of malicious attacks.

### Two-Party Computation for Privacy Preservation

There is a research strand that introduces a third party and applies two-party computation techniques for privacy preservation, such as [31][32][15]. Our work follows this direction. To our knowledge, we are the first to apply two-party computation techniques (e.g., garbled circuits and cryptographic security formulations) to privacy preservation in the context of database-driven CRNs.
