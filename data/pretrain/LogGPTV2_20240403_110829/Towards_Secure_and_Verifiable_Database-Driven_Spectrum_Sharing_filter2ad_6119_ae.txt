Privacy preservation in database-driven CRNs. Re-
cently, the authors of [9] proposed PriSpectrum, a scheme
that protects SUs’ location privacy in database-driven CRNs.

(−118.067020◦, 34.226950◦), whose channel is ch7 and ERP is 28.700kW.
From the update plotting, we can see that all running times
grow linearly with the number of channels (K), and dividing
into less squares (i.e. smaller N = n× n) improves the update
performance. Most importantly, all running times range on
the order of seconds due to the absence of cryptographical
operations, and thus are negligible compared to the overall
running times of our scheme ranging on the order of minutes,
as we will see below.
C. Performance of Query
1) Our design vs Naive design: We carry out a simulation
to compare the query performance of our design and the
naive design with N = 100 × 100. Query requests are
randomly generated over the squares. Since the naive query
is computationally-intensive, we let Ns varies from 50 to 300.
The experimental results are shown in Fig. 7(b) and 7(e).
Figs. 7(b) and 7(e) demonstrate that: (1) our design is
more efﬁcient than the naive design in term of computation
and communication performance when Ns exceeds 100, and
the performance gaps become larger as Ns increases; (2) both
running times and message volumes of our design grow much
more slowly than those of the naive design.
The reason for (1) is that our design gains efﬁciency by
leveraging parallelism of multiple query operations, while the
computation and communication overheads of the naive design
scale linearly to the number of query operations. The more
query operations are executed in parallel, the more efﬁciency
is gained by our design over the naive design. The reason
for (2) is that when the number of query operations is much
smaller compared to the number of squares (i.e., N = n× n),
our design takes nearly constant running times and message
volumes since the number of tuples being sorted is nearly the
same, while the naive design takes running times and message
volumes linear to the number of query operations due to the
linear growth of computation and communication overheads.
2) Large-scale system performance: In large-scale systems,
the number of SUs Ns may be comparable to the total number
of squares N. We evaluate our query performance in this
context with N = 100 × 100, by varying Ns from 1000 to
10000 for K = 20, 40 and 60, respectively.
Figs. 7(c) and 7(f) trace the experimental results. We can
see that the running times and message volumes grow with

The authors of [30] developed a location privacy-preserving
spectrum auction that can be applied in database-driven
CRNs. However, existing work has considered neither PUs’
operational privacy, nor correctness veriﬁcation of spectrum
database operations. Different from [9], [30], which focused
on solely protecting SUs’ location privacy in database-driven
CRNs, our work not only enables both secure update and query
operations, protecting both PUs’ operational privacy and SUs’
location privacy, and the spectrum database, but also enables
correctness veriﬁcation of database operations in the presence
of malicious attacks.
Two-party computation for privacy preservation. There
is a research strand that introduces a third party and applied
the two-party computation techniques for privacy preservation,
such as [31][32][15]. Our work follows this direction. To our
knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to apply two-party computation
techniques (e.g. garbled circuits and cryptographical security
formulation) to privacy preservation in the context of database-
driven CRNs.
VIII. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have proposed a secure and veriﬁable
scheme for database-driven spectrum sharing, allowing both
update and query operations. Our scheme not only achieves
cryptographical security against semi-honest adversaries, but
also defends against some common malicious attacks. Specif-
ically, it reveals nothing about the primary users’ (PUs’) oper-
ational information (except the public knowledge transmitter
IDs), the secondary users’ (SUs’) location information and the
spectrum database to the spectrum database manager (SDM),
the crypto-service provider (CSP) and all users, resulting that
each SU gets its respective query result. Also, the correctness
of each SU’s query result can be well veriﬁed, so that any
malicious attack violating the integrity of spectrum availability
information could be detected. To our knowledge, this is the
ﬁrst secure and veriﬁable database-driven spectrum sharing
scheme protecting both PUs’ operational privacy and SUs’
location privacy.
