I get an error if i try to install symfony2.7 via composer
trigger_error('Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Definition::setFactoryMethod(getRepository)
is deprecated since version 2.6 and will be removed in 3.0. Use
Definition::setFactory() instead.', 16384)
/Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Definition.php:137
It seems that the XMLFileLoader on 2.7 is not updated. In the master, the
problem seem to be solved.
