When attempting to install Symfony 2.7 via Composer, I encountered the following error:

```
trigger_error('Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Definition::setFactoryMethod(getRepository) is deprecated since version 2.6 and will be removed in 3.0. Use Definition::setFactory() instead.', 16384)
```

This error occurs in `Symfony/Component/DependencyInjection/Definition.php` at line 137.

It appears that the `XMLFileLoader` in Symfony 2.7 has not been updated to reflect this deprecation. However, the issue seems to have been resolved in the master branch.

For reference, here is the relevant code in `XmlFileLoader.php` (line 150) from the Symfony 2.7 branch:

To resolve this, you may need to update your configuration to use `Definition::setFactory()` instead of `Definition::setFactoryMethod()`. Alternatively, consider upgrading to a more recent version of Symfony where this issue has been addressed.
