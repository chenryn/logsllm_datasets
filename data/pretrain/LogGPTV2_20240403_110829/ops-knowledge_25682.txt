I understand that you have already tried searching online for a straightforward method to install the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for Python 2.6 or 2.7 on macOS 10.7.2 (Lion), but haven't found a clear solution yet. Here is a step-by-step guide that should help you:

1. **Install `pip`** (if it's not already installed):
   Open the Terminal and run the following command:
   ```sh
   sudo easy_install pip
   ```

2. **Install PIL** using `pip`:
   After `pip` is installed, you can install PIL by running:
   ```sh
   sudo pip install pil
   ```

If you encounter any issues during the installation, please let me know, and I can provide further assistance.
