User: Please list the application scenarios of database master-slave replication, specify its working principle, advantages and disadvantages, and give a reliable implementation plan.
Assistant: Application scenarios: 1. Database read-write separation: using the master database for write operations and the slave database for read operations can relieve the pressure on the master database and improve database read performance. 2. Data backup: Through master-slave replication, the data of the master database can be synchronized to the slave database to play the role of backup and ensure data security. 3. Data migration: Migrating an existing database to a new server or a new data center can be done through master-slave replication, saving time and reducing the possibility of data errors. Working principle: The working principle of master-slave replication is that the master database records the update operation in the binary log, and the slave database periodically reads the binary log of the master database, updates the data, and synchronizes the data of the master database. Synchronization can be achieved by reading the binary log. Advantages: 1. It can improve the read performance of the database and share the pressure of the main database. 2. Guarantee the high availability of data, once the master database goes down, the slave database can take over the work. 3. Can be used for data backup to ensure data security. Disadvantages: 1. During synchronization, there may be delays in the slave database, and data inconsistencies may occur. 2. When the master database is updated frequently, the replication pressure of the slave database is high, which may affect the database performance. 3. Network or hardware failures may occur during the copying process, and measures must be taken to ensure data security. Implementation plan: 1. Configure the binary log function of the primary database to ensure that data can be synchronized through logs. 2. Configure master-slave replication on the slave database to ensure that the slave database can regularly read the binary log of the master database. 3. Configure the read permission of the slave database to ensure that the slave database can access the binary log of the master database. 4. Turn on the GTID function of the slave library to ensure that each instance of the slave library has a unique GTID identifier to avoid data conflicts. 5. Set up network isolation between the master library and the slave library to ensure the security of network transmission. 6. Regularly check the replication status to ensure data integrity and synchronization.
