Assistant: Actually, my original answer is wrong since you've stated that the web server and mail server exist on the same machine.  The problem is likely mail relay.  Sendmail is likely not configured to relay mail incoming from the web server.

Check /var/log/mail.log, /var/log/mail.err and /var/log/mail.warn and post the error messages when Joomla tries to mail.



Looks like sendmail is only listening on the loopback adapter.

DAEMON_OPTIONS(‘Family=inet, Name=MTA-v4, Port=smtp, Addr=127.0.0.1′)dnl`


Try.

DAEMON_OPTIONS(‘Family=inet, Name=MTA-v4, Port=smtp, Addr=0.0.0.0′)dnl`


That said, be aware that if you openly relay mail, it won't be long before your mail server is blacklisted.  Please read some documentation on SMTP server best-practices.
