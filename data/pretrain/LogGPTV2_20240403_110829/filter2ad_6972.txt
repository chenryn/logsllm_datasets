ABSTRACT
In recent times, we have seen a proliferation of personal
data. This can be attributed not just to a larger propor-
tion of our lives moving online, but also through the rise
of ubiquitous sensing through mobile and IoT devices.
Alongside this surge, concerns over privacy, trust, and
security are expressed more and more as diﬀerent par-
ties attempt to take advantage of this rich assortment
of data.
The Databox seeks to enable all the advantages of
personal data analytics while at the same time enforc-
ing accountability and control in order to protect a
user’s privacy. In this work, we propose and delineate a
personal networked device that allows users to collate,
curate, and mediate their personal data.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade alone, the world has seen an ex-
plosion in the quantity of personal data people produce
daily [4]. As storage space for our online and social me-
dia data cheapens, and sensors become more and more
ubiquitous through wearables, mobile, and IoT devices,
this quantity continues to increase exponentially.

Meanwhile, privacy concerns are becoming an ever
more common theme in the modern zeitgeist. The mar-
ket forces that drive the current rate of technological de-
velopment seem to have long outpaced the rate at which
new legislation comes into eﬀect that protect rights such
as an individual’s privacy. As people release more data
into the wild, occurrences of breaches of privacy are
similarly rising at alarming rates [3].
There is a distinct need to rebalance the distribution
of power between data subjects and data controllers,
while at the same time not impinging on the main
advantages that full control of data provides to con-
trollers. There have been various fragmentary attempts
at addressing this need, but
these are generally
fraught with the shortcomings of centralisation and/or
implicitly overexpose personal data to third parties [1].
In this work, we propose and delineate a solution that
not only covers these issues, but additionally provides
the means to more eﬀortlessly draw on a multitude
of vastly diﬀering sources of data out of the box to
augment or complement analytics: the Databox [1]. It
solves this need for privacy by enforcing accountabil-
ity and control by design, and provides a means for
users to collate, curate, and mediate their personal
data.
2. APPROACH
The Databox is a personal networked device with
a form factor comparable to a home router [1].
It is
conﬁgured to be able to access a user’s personal data
from a variety of sources. These include but are not
limited to online data (social media, online banking,
email), mobile data (motion sensors, GPS), and IoT
devices (temperature sensors, light sensors, wearables).
This data is what is usually collected by third parties
for analytics. In most cases however, a third party only
needs a limited set of results derived from a dataset, and
not the dataset itself. The Databox serves as a platform
upon which the processing of personal data can be done
locally, in the context of Databox apps, and only emit
the necessary results to a third party, thus protecting
the privacy of the user by design.

3. CONCLUSION
The Databox architecture, depicted at a high level in
ﬁgure 1, is spilt into a number of discrete components.
External data sources are interfaced with through data
drivers, which can make data available to apps for
processing, by writing them to system-managed data
stores.
It is important to note that although data
may be stored internally, a Databox should not be
considered a data silo, but rather a platform through
which data can be accessed from arbitrary sources and
processed locally.
Apps, loaded from a remote app store, each declare
a manifest – a set of app metadata that include a deﬁ-
nition of possible permutations of privacy permissions.
This information is presented to the user in the form of
a service level agreement (SLA) alongside the intended
uses of these data sources, and risks and inferences.
Through the SLA, a user is able to “negotiate” and
control access to match their subjective privacy needs.
Access control extends to more speciﬁc granularity re-
strictions such as how long a data source is accessible, at
what frequency it can be accessed, and how much data
can be read, among other source-speciﬁc dimensions of
granularity.
This agreement is enforced by the arbiter at the heart
of the OS. Its primary purpose is to mint reﬁnable
bearer tokens veriﬁable by stores. Beyond that, the
arbiter is responsible for logging all ﬂow of data to en-
force accountability. Based on the information provided
by the arbiter, a user has a full overall view of what
happens to their data and why, and can react accord-
ingly by controlling access – especially in cases where a
third party is involved (such as market research ﬁrms,
universities, government, hospitals, etc.) – through a
dashboard on any client device.
Databox architecture is privacy-aware by design. All
apps are isolated in sandboxed, virtualised containers
and communication with the outside world is heavily
restricted. This, coupled with the open-source nature
of the project and heavy scrutineering of third party
apps, ensures that a user’s privacy is well protected.
The speed at which the way we create, manage, and
consume data is changing, mean that this area of re-
search is only just beginning to gain momentum that
warrants a great deal of discourse. One can imagine
large scale statistics and research being done through
Databoxes; “self-ﬁlling surveys”. To data subjects, the
advantages of control over privacy and personal analyt-
ics is obvious. To data controllers, economic implica-
tions are pervasive; heightened privacy means subjects
are less averse to their data being processed.
Preliminary prototypal
evaluation demonstrates
viable scalability, and paves way for an SDK and
widespread development, that will ultimately return
power over personal data to the individual and spawn
a novel paradigm of personal data analytics.
