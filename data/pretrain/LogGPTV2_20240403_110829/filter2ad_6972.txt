## Abstract
In recent years, the proliferation of personal data has been driven by the increasing digitization of our lives and the ubiquity of sensing devices, such as mobile and IoT devices. This surge in data generation has raised significant concerns about privacy, trust, and security. The Databox framework aims to address these concerns by enabling the benefits of personal data analytics while enforcing accountability and control to protect user privacy. In this work, we propose and detail a personal networked device that allows users to collate, curate, and mediate their personal data.

### CCS Concepts
- Security and privacy → Privacy protections; Information flow control

## 1. Introduction
Over the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in the amount of personal data generated daily [4]. As storage costs for online and social media data have decreased, and sensors have become more ubiquitous through wearables, mobile, and IoT devices, the volume of personal data continues to grow.

Meanwhile, privacy concerns have become a central theme in modern discourse. The rapid pace of technological development often outstrips the implementation of new legislation designed to protect individual privacy rights. As more data is released into the public domain, instances of privacy breaches are also on the rise [3].

There is a clear need to rebalance the power dynamics between data subjects and data controllers, without compromising the advantages that full data control provides to controllers. Previous attempts to address this issue have often fallen short due to centralization and overexposure of personal data to third parties [1].

In this work, we propose and describe the Databox, a solution that not only addresses these issues but also provides a means to effortlessly integrate and analyze diverse data sources. The Databox enforces accountability and control by design, allowing users to manage their personal data effectively.

## 2. Approach
The Databox is a personal networked device with a form factor similar to a home router [1]. It is configured to access a user's personal data from various sources, including online data (social media, online banking, email), mobile data (motion sensors, GPS), and IoT devices (temperature sensors, light sensors, wearables).

Typically, third parties collect this data for analytics. However, they often only require a limited set of results derived from the data, rather than the entire dataset. The Databox serves as a platform for local processing of personal data, ensuring that only the necessary results are shared with third parties, thereby protecting user privacy by design.

### 2.1 Databox Architecture
Figure 1 provides a high-level overview of the Databox components. External data sources are interfaced through data drivers, which make the data available to apps for processing by writing it to system-managed data stores. Although data may be stored internally, the Databox should not be considered a data silo. Instead, it is a platform that enables access to data from various sources for local processing.

Apps, loaded from a remote app store, declare a manifest containing metadata, including definitions of possible privacy permissions. This information is presented to the user in the form of a Service Level Agreement (SLA), along with the intended uses of the data, associated risks, and inferences. Through the SLA, users can negotiate and control access to match their privacy needs.

Access control extends to specific granularities, such as the duration of data access, frequency, and the amount of data that can be read. The arbiter at the heart of the operating system enforces this agreement by minting verifiable bearer tokens and logging all data flows to ensure accountability. Users can monitor and control their data through a dashboard on any client device, especially when third parties are involved, such as market research firms, universities, government, or hospitals.

The Databox architecture is designed with privacy in mind. All apps run in isolated, sandboxed, virtualized containers, and communication with the outside world is heavily restricted. The open-source nature of the project and rigorous scrutiny of third-party apps further enhance user privacy.

## 3. Conclusion
The Databox architecture, depicted in Figure 1, is divided into several discrete components. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate viable scalability, paving the way for an SDK and widespread development. This will ultimately return control over personal data to individuals and create a new paradigm for personal data analytics.

For data subjects, the benefits of privacy control and personal analytics are clear. For data controllers, heightened privacy can lead to greater willingness among subjects to have their data processed, potentially yielding economic benefits.
