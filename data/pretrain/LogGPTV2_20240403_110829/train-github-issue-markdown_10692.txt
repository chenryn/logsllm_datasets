I have optimized the image prediction process using a Python API, which only requires 15 milliseconds. However, when using the same model with a Java API, the process takes over 500 milliseconds.

Optimized version:
Using the Python API, I can predict images in just 15 milliseconds. In contrast, the same model, when utilized via the Java API, requires more than 500 milliseconds for the prediction.
