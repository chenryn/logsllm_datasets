User: I'm looking to play with python mode for emacs on mac os x, but I can't seem to find the source files for the mode.
What are the standard locations, where a default installation of emacs might have put its modes when installed on Mac OS X?
(I'm using GNU Emacs 24.0.95.1 (i386-apple-darwin11.3.0, NS apple-appkit-1138.32))
Assistant: In general I would do M-x describe-function RET python-mode--by default bound to C-h f-- and the first line in the info window is: python-mode is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ``python.el'.
And that python.el is clickable, for me, and takes me to the file that it was defined in, at which point M-x pwd works.
