User: I'm looking for some code to check if a file in the file system is available (not used by another process). How could I do it in Python? Thanks!
How I'll use it: cylically check if file is available and when it is (processes don't need it anymore) delete it.
Assistant: If the file other process has the file open and you delete it, it will not be removed from the filesystem until all processes close their handles to it.
If the other process merely needs its file handle/object to continue to work you may safely delete the file, it will be removed when the process closes its handle. If you want to be able to call open() on the file until the process has finished with it, both processes need to use locks (see fcntl.flock()).
