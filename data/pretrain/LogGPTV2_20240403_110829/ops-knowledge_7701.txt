User: I am trying to make my python script executable without going through the terminal typing like
python test.py
I want to make it able to run when i click on the file.
How i going to do this in my fedora machine.
Assistant: Add #!/usr/bin/env python at the very beginning of file.
Make chmod u+x filename.py
Change your extension from .py to .sh, so your linux distro's UI will recognize it as shell script and try to execute.
