# Examples bug report
## Example name
with-ant-design
## Describe the bug
Antd v4 (alpha) builds should include only actually used icons. But in `with-
ant-design` example all 1Mb of icons are bundled.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Download and unpack two attached archives. Both contain same example but one with nextjs and one with create-react-app
  2. Run `npm i` in both examples
  3. Run `npm run stats` in both examples
  4. See at `icons-svg` size inside `@and-design`. With `create react app` it will be about 9Kb. With nextjs it will be about 800Kb.
