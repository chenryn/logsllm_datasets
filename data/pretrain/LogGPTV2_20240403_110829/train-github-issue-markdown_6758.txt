Hello,

I am currently running Elasticsearch version 0.90.5 on a Windows Server 2008 R2 environment. In the `service.bat` file, I have set the `ES_HEAP_SIZE` to 2GB. When I run the script with `ECHO ON`, it correctly displays the value as 2g.

However, when I start the service and check the heap size, it shows only 111 MB as committed. On the other hand, when I run Elasticsearch using `elasticsearch.bat` with `ES_HEAP_SIZE=2g`, the heap size is correctly reported as 1.9 GB.

For reference, I am using the Server JRE 1.7 Update 40. I also previously tried using the Client JRE 1.7 Update 25, but the results were the same.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
