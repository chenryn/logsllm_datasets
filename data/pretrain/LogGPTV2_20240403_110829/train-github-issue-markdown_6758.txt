Hi,  
I am running elasticsearch 0.90.5 on windows 2008 R2. In service.bat I updated
ES_HEAP_SIZE as 2g I checked script with Echo ON and it showed my 2g .  
However when I run the service and check heap committed it comes as 111 mb .
I check running the es with elasticsearch.bat with ES_HEAP_SIZE=2g and it
shows heap committed as 1.9 g.  
By the way I am using server jre 1.7 u40 .  
However I earlier tried client jre 1.7 u 25 but the result is same .
Thanks
