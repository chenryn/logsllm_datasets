 **Current Scenario :**  
Currently powerrun just return a list of apps/links/docs/.. matched to the
entered text.
**Proposed :**  
**Allow result to be shown in split panes** (Like shown by Cerebro App)
  1. One with matched text like currently shown and
  2. Other with possibly preview or more detail link like windows search context menu over search.

I feel the result set would be solid productivity boost if this is merged with
one earlier request mentioned under this thread
