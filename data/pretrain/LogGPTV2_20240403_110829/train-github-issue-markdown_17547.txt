I am not sure if it's a bug or I am doing something wrong (prob the latter).  
I am trying to manually instantiate a component named TodoService.
everything is great on the first 2 steps
     var myProvider = new Provider(TodosService, {
                useFactory: (todoAction, http, todoStatsModel, appStore) => {
                    return new todoAction(TodoAction, http, todoStatsModel, appStore)
                },
                deps: [TodoAction, Http, TodoStatsModel, AppStore]
            });
            var injector =  Injector.resolveAndCreate([myProvider]);
but blows up when I try to get it so I can use it
            var myTodoService = injector.get(TodosService)
am I doing something wrong (possible on the get)?
