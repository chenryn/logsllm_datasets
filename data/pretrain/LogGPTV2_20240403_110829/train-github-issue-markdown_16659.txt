#### Description
I've been unable to perform a grid-search on a pipeline that changes sample
numbers. The pipeline itself works fine, since I use a FunctionTransformer()
that feeds into the classifier with the fewer number of samples.
The idea here is that I need to train a topic model embedding of a large
corpus, and since this is unsupervised, I use the entire corpus I have to
learn these topics (or alternatively use w2v). Then, only a subset of these
are _labeled_ , so I extract the labeled docs and train a LinearSVC to predict
some label based on the topic vectors. I cobbled this pipe together using
Textacy (based on SpaCy) and SKLearn, but it does work, taking a corpus object
as input and getting a classification as output.
I would like to grid search the topic number _using the cross-validation score
of the classifier_. This seems perfectly reasonable to me, since the
parameters I'm picking are in the large-sample space and the CV score I get is
in the small-sample space, but neither affect the ordering of the other, in
principal.
#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Here's a notebook gist, but note that there are a few extra classes I've
defined externally to process the text corpus and return topic vectors. Still,
the pipe works just _not in the grid-search_.
#### Expected Results
CV score of a classifier fed topic vectors (trained from more samples than the
classifier has labels for) for varying numbers of topics/model types.
#### Actual Results
See gist.
