O IssueCred(m, φ) → (σ): Credentials issuance is com-
posed of three algorithms:
O PrepareBlindSign(m, φ) → (d, Λ, φ): The users gen-
erate an El-Gamal key-pair (d, γ = gd
1 ); pick a random
1The original paper of Pointcheval and Sanders [43] proposes a sequen-
tial aggregate signature protocol that is unsuitable for threshold credentials
issuance (see Section VII).
2This algorithm can be turned into the KeyGen and AggKey algorithms
described in Section III-B using techniques illustrated by Gennaro et al. [27]
or Kate et al. [33].

o ∈ Fp, compute the commitment cm and the group
element h ∈ G1 as follows:
cm = gm
1 ho

and
h = H(cm)
Pick a random k ∈ Fp and compute an El-Gamal
encryption of m as below:
c = Enc(hm) = (gk
1 , γkhm)
Output
(d, Λ = (γ, cm, c, πs), φ), where φ is an
application-speciﬁc predicate satisﬁed by m, and πs is
deﬁned by:
πs = NIZK{(d, m, o, k) : γ = gd
1 ∧ cm = gm

∧ c = (gk
1 , γkhm) ∧ φ(m) = 1}
