**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Re-opened Applications

Adversaries may modify `.plist` files to automatically launch an application when a user logs in. On macOS, when a user logs out or restarts the system via the Graphical User Interface (GUI), they are presented with a prompt that includes a checkbox option to "Reopen windows when logging back in." If this option is selected, all currently open applications are added to a property list file named `com.apple.loginwindow.[UUID].plist`, which is stored in the `~/Library/Preferences/ByHost` directory. The applications listed in this `.plist` file will be automatically reopened the next time the user logs in.

This technique allows adversaries to ensure that their malicious applications persist and are executed each time the user logs in, thereby maintaining access and control over the system.
