To install 0MQ on Ubuntu 12.04, you can use the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libzmq-dev
$ sudo apt-get install python-zmq
```

However, if you encounter issues with 0MQ not being recognized within a virtual environment, there are two main approaches to resolve this:

### Option 1: Install Python Packages Using `pip` in the Virtual Environment
1. **Create and activate your virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv myenv
   $ source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install the `pyzmq` package using `pip`:**
   ```bash
   (myenv) $ pip install pyzmq
   ```

This will ensure that the `pyzmq` package is installed within your virtual environment and can be used without any issues.

### Option 2: Enable System-Wide Packages in the Virtual Environment
If you prefer to use the system-wide installation of `python-zmq` within your virtual environment, you can create the virtual environment with the `--system-site-packages` option:

1. **Create the virtual environment with system-wide packages:**
   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv myenv --system-site-packages
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   $ source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

By using the `--system-site-packages` option, your virtual environment will have access to the system-installed packages, including `python-zmq`.

Choose the approach that best fits your needs. The first option is generally recommended for better isolation and reproducibility.
