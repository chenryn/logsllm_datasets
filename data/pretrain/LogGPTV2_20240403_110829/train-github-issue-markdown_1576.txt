    What happened?
    - The external API that my application is using, sometimes returns no values for one of
    the float64 fields. When that happens, I cannot unmarshal the rest of the document.
    What should have happened instead?
    - Unmarshalling empty float fields should be handled gracefully.
    Please provide any additional information below.
