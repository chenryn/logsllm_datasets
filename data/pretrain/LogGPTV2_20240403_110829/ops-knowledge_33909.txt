User: I accidentally removed /Library/Python on OS X Leopard. How can I reinstall that?
Assistant: /Library/Python contains your python site-packages, which is the local software you've installed using commands like python setup.py install. The pieces here are third-party packages, not items installed by Apple - your actual Python installation is still safe in /System/Library/etc... 
In other words, the default OS leaves these directories mostly blank... nothing in there is critical (just a readme and a path file).
In this case, you'll have to :

Recreate the directory structure:
Re-install your third-party libraries.

The directory structure on a default OS X install is:

/Library/Python/2.3/site-packages
  /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages
