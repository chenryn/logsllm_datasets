A. Screening
1.1) How old are you? You must be at least 18 years old to
participate in this study.
1.2) Please select
the statement
that best describes your
familiarity with augmented reality (AR) glasses (e.g.,
Hololens, MagicLeap, Google Glass, etc.)
1.3) Please select the statement that best describes your fa-
miliarity with virtual reality (VR) devices (e.g., Oculus,
HTC Vive, etc.)
1.4) Have you ever developed any applications for AR or VR
devices?
B. Developers
2.1) Which AR or VR glasses have you developed applica-
tions for?
and VR glasses?

2.5) What form of authentication did you use in your appli-
2.6) Please describe the type(s) of authentication in more
detail. For example, if it was a password, how did the
user enter the password? If it was a biometric, which one
was used?
2.7) Why did you choose that type of authentication over
cations?
others?
Sections C and D were shown once for AR and once for VR.
C. Device usage
3.1) Select the device you have used the most often.
3.2) Do you own this device?
3.3) What is the major reason you use this device?
D. Authentication
Authentication is the process of proving your identity via a
password, biometric, paired device, or any number of other
methods.
4.1) Have you ever authenticated on a [AR/VR] device?
4.2) On which device(s) did you have to authenticate?
4.3) When did you have to authenticate on the device(s)?
4.4) What method of authentication did you use on the de-
vice(s)?
Questions 4.5-4.8 were repeated for each method used.
4.5) How secure do you feel using [method] for authentication
on your [AR/VR] devices?
4.6) Please explain your reasoning for the above question.
4.7) How easy/hard is it to use [method] on [AR/VR] devices?
4.8) Please explain your reasoning for the above question.
E. Demographics & Followup
1) How do you identify your gender?
2) What is your highest education level?
3) What is your occupation?
4) Can we follow up with you for a short interview ( 30
minutes)? If so, please provide an email or phone number
we can use to contact you.
5) If you are NOT accessing this survey through MTurk,
please enter your email for a chance to win a $50 Amazon
Gift card. We will use the email for sending the gift card,
if you are selected in the random draw. We will not use
the email for any other purposes.
