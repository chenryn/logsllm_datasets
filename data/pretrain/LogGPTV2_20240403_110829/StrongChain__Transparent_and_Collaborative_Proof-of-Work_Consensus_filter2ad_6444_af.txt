### TOM and GHOSTDAG Protocol

TOM introduces and employs a greedy algorithm, known as the GHOSTDAG protocol, to determine the order of transactions. This approach resolves the applicability issues encountered with SPECTRE but at the cost of slower transaction confirmation times. The authors suggest that integrating the advantages of PHANTOM and SPECTRE into a complete system remains a future research direction.

### Decentralization-Oriented Schemes

Several previous proposals have aimed to decentralize mining. One strategy is to design mining processes that discourage miners from outsourcing resources or forming coalitions. Permacoin [25] was an early attempt in this direction. Instead of proving their work, miners in Permacoin prove that they store fragments of a globally agreed-upon file. Permacoin is designed with the following features:
- Payment private keys are tied to puzzle solutions, making it risky for miners to outsource these keys.
- Sequential and random storage access is crucial for efficient mining, which deters miners from outsourcing data.
- If the file is valuable, Permacoin also serves the secondary purpose of replicating the file, as miners store its fragments.

The concept of non-outsourceable mining has been further developed, with other schemes proposed [26, 50]. Miller et al. [26] introduced "strongly non-outsourceable puzzles" to discourage pool creation by requiring all pool participants to remain honest. In this scheme, any pool participant can steal the pool reward without revealing their identity. The scheme relies on zero-knowledge proofs, necessitating a trusted setup and introducing significant computational overheads. While this scheme is orthogonal to StrongChain and could be integrated, no large-scale deployment has occurred since its introduction, leaving its promised benefits unverified.

### SmartPool: A Different Approach

Luu et al. [23] proposed SmartPool, which implements the functionality of mining pools using smart contracts. This approach runs natively on smart-contract platforms and eliminates the need for actual mining pools and their managers. However, SmartPool still imposes fees for running smart contracts, while preserving most of the benefits of pool mining.

### Rewarding Schemes for Mining Pools

Mining pools divide block rewards (including transaction fees) among miners in proportion to their contributions. Typically, individual miner contributions are verified through weak solutions called shares. Various rewarding schemes are employed by mining pools, with the simplest being the proportional scheme, where the reward for a strong block is divided based on the number of shares submitted. However, this scheme is vulnerable to pool hopping attacks [33].

To address this security issue, alternative rewarding systems, such as the Pay-per-last-N-shares (PPLNS) scheme and its variants, have been developed. For a detailed analysis of different pool rewarding systems, refer to [37].

### StrongChain's Reward Mechanism

The reward mechanisms in StrongChain can be conceptually viewed as a built-in mining pool within the protocol. However, there are key differences:
- In StrongChain, rewarding is not a zero-sum game, and miners do not share rewards.
- Unlike traditional mining pools, StrongChain's design prevents various in- and cross-pool attacks.
- Miner collaboration in Bitcoin mining pools is often seen as a "necessary evil," whereas in StrongChain, collaboration is beneficial for both miners and the overall system.

Further discussion on StrongChain and mining pools is provided in Section 6.2.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we propose a transparent and collaborative proof-of-work protocol based on Nakamoto consensus and Bitcoin, with modifications to their core designs. Specifically, we leverage weak solutions, which, although not finalizing block creation, positively contribute to blockchain properties. We also introduce a rewarding scheme that incentivizes miners to exchange and append weak solutions, leading to a more secure, fair, and efficient system. Surprisingly, our approach also addresses seemingly unrelated issues like the freshness property. Our implementation indicates the efficiency and deployability of our approach.

Incentives-oriented analysis of consensus protocols is a relatively new field. Future work will involve modeling our protocol with novel frameworks and tools. Additionally, we aim to explore how StrongChain can be combined with systems addressing other drawbacks of Nakamoto consensus [10, 19, 21] or adapted to a proof-of-stake setting.
