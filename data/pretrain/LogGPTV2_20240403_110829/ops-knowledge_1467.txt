Question: "An Apple device with an A15 SoC is in the process of starting up. The Secure Enclave is initializing and preparing to load sepOS. Select the steps that accurately describe the security measures and components involved in this startup process."
 "A": "The Secure Enclave Boot ROM establishes a hardware root of trust and initializes the Memory Protection Engine to provide cryptographic protection."
 "B": "The Application Processor sends the sepOS image to the Secure Enclave Boot ROM, which verifies the cryptographic hash and signature before executing sepOS."
 "C": "The Memory Protection Engine verifies the nonce and integrity tree for reads, and updates the nonce and integrity tree for writes to the SRAM."
 "D": "The Public Key Accelerator uses a hash of the sepOS to generate OS-bound keys before the Secure Enclave Boot ROM initiates the sepOS."
Answer: ABC
