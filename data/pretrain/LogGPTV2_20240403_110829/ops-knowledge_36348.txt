User: Please describe how to implement system security hardening, and provide some common security strategies.
Assistant: System security hardening refers to a series of maintenance, optimization, and repair work on the computer system, so as to improve the overall security performance of the system. The following are some common security strategies: 1. Update patches in time: The security patches of the operating system and software should be installed in time to fix known loopholes and prevent hackers from exploiting loopholes to attack the system. 2. Strengthen user management: Precisely control user permissions, reduce unnecessary permissions, and avoid user misuse and illegal operations. 3. Strengthen identity authentication: assign a unique identity and password to each user, and adopt a variety of authentication technologies, such as two-factor authentication. 4. Set security policies: formulate security policies and enforce them, such as password complexity rules, login failure lock, remote access restrictions, etc. 5. Install anti-virus software: install anti-virus software in time, and regularly update the virus database to ensure that the system is free from threats such as viruses and malware. 6. Firewall settings: Set up a firewall to control the flow in and out of the network and prevent attacks from unknown networks. 7. Data backup: regularly back up important data to ensure that the data can still be restored when the system is attacked. 8. Encryption technology: encrypt and store important data to ensure data security. 9. Monitoring and auditing: Through the network security monitoring system, log auditing system, etc., abnormal behaviors or attacks are discovered and dealt with in a timely manner. 10. Training and education: Conduct network security emergency education for employees to improve their security awareness and reduce the risk of being attacked by hackers.
