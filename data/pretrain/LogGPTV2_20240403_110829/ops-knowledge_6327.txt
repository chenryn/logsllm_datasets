Question: A developer is adding a new system process that relies on an existing Android Open Source Project (AOSP) Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). To ensure proper operation and maintain compatibility with potential framework-only updates, where should the policy for this new system component be placed and why?
"A": "The policy should be placed in `system/sepolicy/public` to allow interaction across the `system/vendor` interface and to be updated with framework-only OTA updates.",
"B": "The policy should be placed in `system/sepolicy/private` because it is interacting through an interface already established by AOSP and needs to be isolated from framework-only OTA updates.",
"C": "The policy should be placed in `device/manufacturer/device-name/sepolicy` to keep the system policy unaware of vendor-specific details.",
"D": "The policy should be placed in `system/sepolicy/public` and remove existing AOSP policy to ensure compatibility with the new system component."
Answer: B
