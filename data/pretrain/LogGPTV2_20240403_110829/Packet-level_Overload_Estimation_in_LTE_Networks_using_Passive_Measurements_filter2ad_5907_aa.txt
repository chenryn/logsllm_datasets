ABSTRACT
Over 87% of US mobile wireless subscriptions are currently held by
LTE-capable devices [34]. However, prior work has demonstrated
that connectivity may not equate to usable service. Even in well-
provisioned urban networks, unusually high usage (such as during
a public event or after a natural disaster) can lead to overload that
makes the LTE service difficult, if not impossible to use, even if
the user is solidly within the coverage area. A typical approach
to detect and quantify overload on LTE networks is to secure the
cooperation of the network provider for access to internal metrics.
An alternative approach is to deploy multiple mobile devices with
active subscriptions to each mobile network operator (MNO). Both
approaches are resource and time intensive. In this work, we pro-
pose a novel method to estimate overload in LTE networks using
only passive measurements, and without requiring provider co-
operation. We use this method to analyze packet-level traces for
three commercial LTE service providers, T-Mobile, Verizon and
AT&T, from several locations during both typical levels of usage
and during public events that yield large, dense crowds. This study
presents the first look at overload estimation through the analysis
of unencrypted broadcast messages. We show that an upsurge in
broadcast reject and cell barring messages can accurately detect an
increase in network overload.

1 INTRODUCTION
With 3 billion users and growing, LTE is set to become the lead-
ing mobile network technology worldwide in 2019 [24]. With this
growth comes critical challenges in sustaining consistent, high-
quality service to an increasing subscriber base [36]. In a well
provisioned region, sudden escalation in traffic demand from user
equipment (UEs) can occur during large gatherings (e.g., street fes-
tivals, protests). Similarly, after a disaster, damaged infrastructure
and atypical volume of utilization can overwhelm a previously well-
provisioned network. Prior work has also demonstrated that even
in areas that cellular providers claim are well-covered, persistent
over-usage due to insufficient capacity can exist [38].
As a specific example, in 2017, Hurricane Maria brought down
95% of cellular sites in Puerto Rico [21]. As a result, affected citizens
on the ground were unable to request rescue from rising flood wa-
ters. In such disaster scenarios, call volume may overload capacity
even when cellular towers remain functional, causing base stations
to reject calls [32, 43]. Unfortunately, cellular providers have incen-
tive to state that damaged cellular services have been returned to
an operational state. Indeed, after Hurricane Maria, statuspr.org
soon reported that over 90% of cell towers were again operational;
however, anecdotal evidence indicated such statistics were grossly
over-stated.
To remedy this disparity between reported coverage and actual
usability, individual users, watchdog groups and government agen-
cies need tools to verify whether a network is adequately serving
customers. After a disaster the FCC typically receives outage re-
ports from telecoms, for instance [22], but the actual usability, due
in part to overload, on active towers is difficult to assess without
access to the internal network. Ideally, public entities should be
able to assess the overload and operational status/usability for a
particular base station. Further, they should be able to accomplish
this without relying on the cooperation of a cellular provider.
To address this critical need, we propose a novel solution to
infer overload in LTE networks based on messages broadcast by
the eNodeB. Through the analysis of multiple message types, we
draw clear comparisons between instances of high network uti-
lization and typical operating conditions for several eNodeBs. Our
results indicate that eNodeBs demonstrate measurable performance
differences indicative of overload conditions.
Importantly, our solution works without the cooperation of the
cellular provider. Using low-cost, readily usable off-the-shelf equip-
ment, we demonstrate that unencrypted broadcast messages sent by
the eNodeB [12] on the broadcast channel can be passively collected
and analyzed to estimate local overload, and hence usability.

We quantify our results by computing two normalized metrics,
which are proportional to the number of connection reject messages
and cell barring signals (cellBarred), respectively (cell barring
signals prohibit UEs from camping on a particular cell). In addition,
we evaluate the back-off timer (waitTime) encapsulated in each
reject message. Note that in LTE, a connection reject message does
not contain a rejection case. Consequently, we must use higher
waitTime values, coupled with high rates of connection request
denials, to reveal possible overload.
To test the operation of our system, we perform multiple mea-
surement campaigns: two at events with unusually large crowd
gatherings, and two at those same locations but during times of
typical usage. Through these measurement campaigns, we collect
and analyze over 3.2 million LTE frames. Our analysis indicates
that overload on an eNodeB can be identified through an increase
in reject messages and mean back-off time. Moreover, these events
are often accompanied by a significant increase in cell barring sig-
nals. We show that overloaded cell towers frequently deny larger
percentages of connection requests and issue higher waitTime as
compared to typical utilization periods. Further, we observe an
unusual number of barring signals prohibiting UEs from camping
on their desired eNodeBs.
2 RELATED WORK
Diagnostic methods in LTE networks are known to be cumbersome.
This includes packet-level analysis to estimate overload, because
messages transmitted after the connection establishment stage are
invisible to a passive device. As a result, there is little prior work
that leverages passive measurements to detect overload.
Previous work has led to the development of several network
analysis tools. xgoldmon [20], for instance, can monitor control
plane messages over 2G/3G but not LTE. SCAT [26] is a tool de-
signed to detect problems in cellular networks, which although
quite useful is limited to only active monitoring on Qualcomm
and Samsung basebands. QXDM [31] is a tool developed to diagnose
network statistics that is limited to only Qualcomm baseband and
requires a paid license. While [28, 39, 40] offer very similar feature
sets to the tools discussed above, they are not tailored to work
with software defined radios for passive monitoring. Schmitt et
al. [37, 38] employ a comparable approach to ours, except their
study is limited to GSM networks. We believe the biggest draw-
back of these prior tools is their inability to work with passive
measurement devices, such as software-defined radios (SDRs).
Several prior works have studied various congestion control
algorithms in LTE networks [19, 27, 30, 41], but little work has
explored overload detection without involving an active monitoring
aspect. Torres et al. [42] use machine learning models to predict
network congestion. However, their approach requires considerable
historical data and is not suitable for urban sectors where eNodeBs
are upgraded regularly to cater to increasing user bases, nor can it
be used to assess current overload levels. Chakraborty et al. [15]
introduce LoadSense, which offers a measure of cellular load using
channel sensing at the PHY layer. Similarly, [44] allows a client
to efficiently monitor the LTE basestation’s PHY-layer resource
allocation, and then map such information to an estimation of
available bandwidth. Cellular Link Aware Web loading (CLAW) is

proposed in [45], which boosts mobile Web loading using a physical-
layer informed transport protocol. Although the aforementioned
tools can estimate whether the radio resources are fully allocated,
they do not explicitly reveal whether the network is overloaded.
Our method focuses primarily on analyzing messages broadcast
before a connection is established, as these messages can be captured
and analyzed by low-cost SDRs. Our approach is portable, scalable,
independent of any proprietary platform (e.g., Qualcomm, Samsung,
etc.) and works with any cellular service.
3 BACKGROUND
In our work we examine cellular transmissions using software-
defined radios. While most of the transmissions on LTE are en-
crypted between the eNodeB (LTE base station) and UE (user equip-
ment, such as a cellphone) [11], connection establishment messages
are sent in the clear. We use these messages in order to determine
overload, as described in the following sections.
3.1 Radio Resource Control (RRC)
The RRC protocol [5, 10] supports the transfer of common Non-
Access Stratum (NAS) [4] information (which is applicable to all
UEs) as well as dedicated NAS information (which is applicable only
to a specific UE). Directed RRC messages (unicast to a single UE)
are transferred across Signalling Radio Bearers (SRB)s, which are
mapped onto logical channels [6, 7] – either the Common Control
CHannel (CCCH) during connection establishment or a Dedicated
Control CHannel (DCCH) if the UE is in an active connection state.
Similarly, System Information (SI) messages are mapped to the
Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH). Since messages on DCCH are
on a private channel, they cannot be decoded by passive monitoring
devices.
Common Control CHannel (CCCH): This channel is used to
deliver control information in both uplink and downlink directions
when there is no confirmed association between a UE and the
eNodeB – i.e. during connection establishment. Messages on this
channel are transmitted in the clear, and can be passively decoded.
We leverage this knowledge to analyze signalling messages and
estimate the overload level in an eNodeB.
Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH): This is a downlink chan-
nel that is used to broadcast System Information (SI). It consists of
the Master Information Block (MIB) and a number of System Infor-
mation Blocks (SIBs). The MIB and SIBs are broadcast through Radio
Resource Control (RRC) messages. SIB1 is carried by SystemInfor-
mationBlockType1 message. Though there are other SI messages,
we focus on SIB1 for the purpose of this study. SIB1 contains the cell
barring (cellBarred) status, which indicates whether or not a UE
may choose the cell. When cellBarred status is indicated, the UE

is not permitted to select/reselect this cell, not even for emergency
calls [9]. In that case, the UE may connect to another cell.
3.2 Signalling Radio Bearers
A Signalling Radio Bearer (SRB) [8] carries CCCH signalling data.
An SRB is used during connection establishment to establish the
Radio Access Bearers (RABs) and to deliver signalling while on the
connection (for instance, to perform a handover, reconfiguration
or release). There are three types of SRBs. SRB0 uses the CCCH
channel with transparent mode RLC while SRB1 and SRB2 use the
dedicated channel with acknowledged mode RLC. In other words,
SRB0 can be decoded by non-network equipment such as a software
defined radio in the vicinity, while SRB1 and SRB2 cannot. Table 1
shows various signalling messages SRB0 carries.
For our study, we focus on RRCConnectionReject messages
(solid arrow in Figure 1) with corresponding waitTime (back-off
time, before a UE can again initiate a connection) values, Connectio-
nRequest messages, and cellBarred signals (BCCH). We formu-
late two normalized metrics based on the percentage of reject mes-
sages per request sent and the ratio of cellBarred signals to the
number of SIB1 messages transmitted over thirty-second time bins.
3.3 Managing Overload
Overload management is invoked in order to unburden a cell to an
acceptable level when overload is detected, for instance if the cell
load remains above a threshold for some continuous period. An
alternative strategy, such as that used by WCDMA, is to lower the
bit rates of connected users until the load returns to an acceptable
level [29]. However, in a pure packet-based system such as LTE, the
user bit rate is maintained at the MAC scheduler [17], which already
provides a soft degradation of user throughput as the system load
