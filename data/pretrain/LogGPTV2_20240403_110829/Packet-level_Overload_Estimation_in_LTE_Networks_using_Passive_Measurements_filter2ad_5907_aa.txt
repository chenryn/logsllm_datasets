## Abstract

Over 87% of US mobile wireless subscriptions are currently held by LTE-capable devices [34]. However, prior work has shown that connectivity does not always equate to usable service. Even in well-provisioned urban networks, unusually high usage (such as during public events or after natural disasters) can lead to overload, making the LTE service difficult, if not impossible, to use, even within the coverage area. Traditional methods to detect and quantify overload on LTE networks often require cooperation with network providers or the deployment of multiple mobile devices with active subscriptions, both of which are resource and time-intensive. In this work, we propose a novel method to estimate overload in LTE networks using only passive measurements, without requiring provider cooperation. We analyze packet-level traces from three commercial LTE service providers—T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T—during both typical usage and large, dense crowds. This study presents the first analysis of overload estimation through unencrypted broadcast messages, demonstrating that an increase in broadcast reject and cell barring messages can accurately detect network overload.

## 1. Introduction

With 3 billion users and growing, LTE is set to become the leading mobile network technology worldwide in 2019 [24]. This growth brings critical challenges in sustaining consistent, high-quality service to an increasing subscriber base [36]. In well-provisioned regions, sudden increases in traffic demand from user equipment (UEs) can occur during large gatherings (e.g., street festivals, protests). Similarly, after a disaster, damaged infrastructure and atypical usage volumes can overwhelm previously well-provisioned networks. Prior work has also shown that even in areas claimed to be well-covered, persistent over-usage due to insufficient capacity can exist [38].

For example, in 2017, Hurricane Maria brought down 95% of cellular sites in Puerto Rico [21], leaving affected citizens unable to request rescue from rising flood waters. In such scenarios, call volume may overload capacity even when cellular towers remain functional, causing base stations to reject calls [32, 43]. Unfortunately, cellular providers have an incentive to report that damaged services have been restored. After Hurricane Maria, statuspr.org reported that over 90% of cell towers were operational, but anecdotal evidence suggested these statistics were overstated.

To address the disparity between reported coverage and actual usability, individual users, watchdog groups, and government agencies need tools to verify whether a network is adequately serving customers. The FCC typically receives outage reports from telecoms after a disaster [22], but assessing actual usability due to overload on active towers is challenging without access to internal network data. Ideally, public entities should be able to assess the overload and operational status/usability of a particular base station without relying on the cooperation of a cellular provider.

To meet this critical need, we propose a novel solution to infer overload in LTE networks based on messages broadcast by the eNodeB. By analyzing multiple message types, we draw clear comparisons between instances of high network utilization and typical operating conditions for several eNodeBs. Our results indicate that eNodeBs demonstrate measurable performance differences indicative of overload conditions.

Importantly, our solution works without the cooperation of the cellular provider. Using low-cost, off-the-shelf equipment, we demonstrate that unencrypted broadcast messages sent by the eNodeB [12] on the broadcast channel can be passively collected and analyzed to estimate local overload and hence usability.

We quantify our results by computing two normalized metrics: the number of connection reject messages and cell barring signals (cellBarred), respectively. Additionally, we evaluate the back-off timer (waitTime) encapsulated in each reject message. In LTE, a connection reject message does not contain a rejection case, so we use higher waitTime values and high rates of connection request denials to reveal possible overload.

To test our system, we conducted multiple measurement campaigns: two at events with unusually large crowd gatherings and two at the same locations during times of typical usage. Through these campaigns, we collected and analyzed over 3.2 million LTE frames. Our analysis indicates that overload on an eNodeB can be identified through an increase in reject messages and mean back-off time. These events are often accompanied by a significant increase in cell barring signals. We show that overloaded cell towers frequently deny larger percentages of connection requests and issue higher waitTime compared to typical utilization periods. Further, we observe an unusual number of barring signals prohibiting UEs from camping on their desired eNodeBs.

## 2. Related Work

Diagnostic methods in LTE networks are known to be cumbersome, including packet-level analysis to estimate overload, as messages transmitted after the connection establishment stage are invisible to passive devices. Consequently, there is little prior work leveraging passive measurements to detect overload.

Previous work has led to the development of several network analysis tools. For example, xgoldmon [20] can monitor control plane messages over 2G/3G but not LTE. SCAT [26] is a tool designed to detect problems in cellular networks, though it is limited to active monitoring on Qualcomm and Samsung basebands. QXDM [31] is a diagnostic tool for network statistics, limited to Qualcomm baseband and requiring a paid license. While [28, 39, 40] offer similar feature sets, they are not tailored for software-defined radios (SDRs) for passive monitoring. Schmitt et al. [37, 38] employ a comparable approach, but their study is limited to GSM networks. The biggest drawback of these prior tools is their inability to work with passive measurement devices like SDRs.

Several prior works have studied various congestion control algorithms in LTE networks [19, 27, 30, 41], but little work has explored overload detection without active monitoring. Torres et al. [42] use machine learning models to predict network congestion, but their approach requires considerable historical data and is not suitable for urban sectors where eNodeBs are regularly upgraded. Chakraborty et al. [15] introduce LoadSense, which measures cellular load using channel sensing at the PHY layer. Similarly, [44] allows a client to monitor the LTE basestation’s PHY-layer resource allocation and map it to available bandwidth. Cellular Link Aware Web loading (CLAW) [45] boosts mobile web loading using a physical-layer informed transport protocol. Although these tools can estimate radio resource allocation, they do not explicitly reveal network overload.

Our method focuses on analyzing messages broadcast before a connection is established, as these messages can be captured and analyzed by low-cost SDRs. Our approach is portable, scalable, independent of any proprietary platform, and works with any cellular service.

## 3. Background

In our work, we examine cellular transmissions using software-defined radios (SDRs). Most LTE transmissions are encrypted between the eNodeB (LTE base station) and UE (user equipment, such as a cellphone) [11], but connection establishment messages are sent in the clear. We use these messages to determine overload, as described below.

### 3.1 Radio Resource Control (RRC)

The RRC protocol [5, 10] supports the transfer of common Non-Access Stratum (NAS) information (applicable to all UEs) and dedicated NAS information (applicable only to a specific UE). Directed RRC messages (unicast to a single UE) are transferred across Signalling Radio Bearers (SRBs), which are mapped onto logical channels—either the Common Control CHannel (CCCH) during connection establishment or a Dedicated Control CHannel (DCCH) if the UE is in an active connection state. System Information (SI) messages are mapped to the Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH). Since messages on DCCH are on a private channel, they cannot be decoded by passive monitoring devices.

#### Common Control CHannel (CCCH)
This channel is used to deliver control information in both uplink and downlink directions when there is no confirmed association between a UE and the eNodeB—i.e., during connection establishment. Messages on this channel are transmitted in the clear and can be passively decoded. We leverage this to analyze signaling messages and estimate the overload level in an eNodeB.

#### Broadcast Control CHannel (BCCH)
This is a downlink channel used to broadcast System Information (SI), consisting of the Master Information Block (MIB) and several System Information Blocks (SIBs). The MIB and SIBs are broadcast through RRC messages. SIB1, carried by the SystemInformationBlockType1 message, contains the cell barring (cellBarred) status, indicating whether a UE may choose the cell. If cellBarred is indicated, the UE is not permitted to select/reselect this cell, even for emergency calls [9]. In that case, the UE may connect to another cell.

### 3.2 Signalling Radio Bearers

A Signalling Radio Bearer (SRB) [8] carries CCCH signaling data. SRB0 uses the CCCH channel with transparent mode RLC, while SRB1 and SRB2 use the dedicated channel with acknowledged mode RLC. Thus, SRB0 can be decoded by non-network equipment like SDRs, while SRB1 and SRB2 cannot. Table 1 shows the signaling messages carried by SRB0.

| **Channel Type** | **RLC Mode** | **RRC Message** | **Direction** |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|
| CCCH            | Transparent  | RRC Connection Setup | Downlink     |
|                  |              | RRC Connection Reject | Downlink     |
|                  |              | RRC Connection Request | Uplink       |

For our study, we focus on RRCConnectionReject messages with corresponding waitTime values, ConnectionRequest messages, and cellBarred signals (BCCH). We formulate two normalized metrics based on the percentage of reject messages per request sent and the ratio of cellBarred signals to the number of SIB1 messages transmitted over thirty-second time bins.

### 3.3 Managing Overload

Overload management is invoked to unburden a cell to an acceptable level when overload is detected, such as if the cell load remains above a threshold for some continuous period. An alternative strategy, used by WCDMA, is to lower the bit rates of connected users until the load returns to an acceptable level [29]. However, in a pure packet-based system like LTE, the user bit rate is managed by the MAC scheduler [17], which provides a soft degradation of user throughput as the system load increases.
