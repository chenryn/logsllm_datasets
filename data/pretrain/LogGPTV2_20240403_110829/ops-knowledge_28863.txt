User: In a network attack, we found a large amount of DOS attack traffic, how to defend against this attack?
Assistant: Here are some ways that might help defend against DOS attacks: 1. Strengthen network security: Take strict security measures, including strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and more. 2. Traffic blocking: Try to use firewalls or other network devices to filter out the required data from attack traffic and block malicious traffic. 3. Strengthen network monitoring: Using some monitoring tools, as well as software and hardware that monitor and classify malicious traffic in real time, can intervene in time for such attacks. 4. Perform traffic cleaning: use third-party cleaning services to clean malicious traffic, and manually distinguish legitimate traffic from malicious traffic. 5. Defense against distributed attacks: Use load balancing to distribute network traffic to multiple servers, so that the traffic of distributed attacks cannot be tolerated by any server. 6. Limit the number of connections: limit the number of connections per IP to protect the network from the impact of a large number of concurrent connection attacks. 7. Suspension of service: If the DOS attack has exceeded an acceptable level, consider suspending the service, resetting the business, and investigating and disposing of the source of the attack.
