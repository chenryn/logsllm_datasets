As pointed out by @dsm054, there are multiple lurking split/partition API
requests. Here are the issues and a short summary of what they would do (there
are some duplicates here, I've checked off those issues/PRs that have been
closed in favor of a related issue):
  * #414: (i think) original issue for these ideas going back 3 years
  * #936: windowing with time-length windows like `pd.rolling_mean(ts, window='30min')` and possibly even arbitrary windows using another column
  * #3066: `split` method on pandas objects, playing around with ideas
  * #3101: a closed PR by @y-p to use the args of lambda to group a frame into views of a sliding window
  * #3685: resampling using the first `n` samples of a bin.
  * #4059: `np.array_split` style API where you can split a pandas object into a list of `k` groups of possibly unequal size (could be a thin wrapper around `np.array_split`, or more integrated into the pandas DSL). IMO, this issue provides the best starting point for an API. SO usage
  * #5494: an API for to allow pandas' `groupby` to have `itertools.groupby` semantics (i.e., preserve the order of duplicated group keys), i.e., `'aabbaa'` would yield groups `['aa', 'bb', 'aa']` rather than `['aaaa', 'bb']`. There'd have to be some changes to the use of `dict` in the groupby backend as noted by @y-p here #4059 (comment).
  * #6675: Ability to select ranged groups via another column, like "select all rows between the values X and Y from column C", e.g., an "events" column where you have a start and end markers and you want to get the data in between the markers. There are a couple of ways you can do this, but it would be nice to have an API for this. This is very similar to #936.
The `toolz` library has a `partitionby` function that provides a nice way to
do some of the splitting on sequences and might provide us with some insight
on how to approach the API.
