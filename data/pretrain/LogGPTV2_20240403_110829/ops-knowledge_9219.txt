User: How to monitor and tune the performance of Linux system?
Assistant: The performance monitoring and tuning of the Linux system can start from the following aspects: 1. Monitoring system resource utilization: use top, ps, vmstat, iostat and other commands to view the current utilization of the system's CPU, memory, disk, network and other resources . 2. Find out the system performance bottleneck: Through the previous resource utilization monitoring, find out the system performance bottleneck, you can use perf, strace, lsof and other tools for in-depth positioning and diagnosis. 3. Adjust system kernel parameters: optimize system performance by modifying kernel parameters of the Linux system, such as reducing memory swap, increasing TCP connections, and so on. 4. Software tuning: optimize and adjust frequently used software in the system, such as reasonably setting the number of threads of the web server, optimizing database indexes, and so on. 5. Hardware upgrade: When the software and kernel parameters have been tuned to the limit, hardware upgrades can be considered, such as increasing the number of CPU cores, memory capacity, replacing high-performance disks, etc. In short, the performance monitoring and tuning of the Linux system needs to be carried out in combination with the actual system environment and application scenarios, and continuous testing and adjustments are required to obtain the best performance.
