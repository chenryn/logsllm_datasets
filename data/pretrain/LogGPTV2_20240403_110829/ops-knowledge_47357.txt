User: I have a small GTK python application that imports a package (Twisted) that may not be loaded twice.
If I run my application in emacs with python-mode.el and press C-c C-c, the application gets executed in a python shell window.
If I now close the application, the python shell stays up and running. If I now press C-c C-c again, emacs "reuses" the old python process and thus I run into problems because I'm installing a Twisted reactor twice.
Is it possible to have python-mode.el open a new shell window each time I execute a buffer?
Assistant: python-mode.el comes with a command py-execute-buffer-dedicated,
 opening a new and reserved process for it
