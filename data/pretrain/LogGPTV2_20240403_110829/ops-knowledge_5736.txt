User: Is it possible to make a program in Python that, when run, does not actually open any window (including command prompt)?
For example, opening the program would appear to do nothing, but in reality, the program is running in the background somewhere.
Thanks!
Assistant: Are you running the python program by double clicking *.py file in Windows?
Then, rename the *.py file to *.pyw.
