|  if 'text' in content_type:  
---|---  
From RFC 2616:  
When no explicit charset parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes
of the "text"  
type are defined to have a default charset value of "ISO-8859-1" when received
via HTTP.
However, from RFC7231:  
The default charset of ISO-8859-1 for text media types has been removed;
Actually, if requests uses the default charset of ISO-8859-1, the property
text of response will always lose the efficiency of chardet and cause messy
code problem.  
I think these lines should be deleted.
