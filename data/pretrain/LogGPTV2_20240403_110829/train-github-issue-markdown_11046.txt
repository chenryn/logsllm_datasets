The error you encountered is due to the presence of spaces in the file paths, which are not properly handled by the `gcc` linker. Here is a more detailed and professional explanation of the issue and the solution:

### Error Description
When attempting to compile the Rust program `helloworld.rs` using the `rustc` command, the following error occurred:

```
C:\Users\Sebastian\Documents\rust>rustc helloworld.rs  
error: linking with gcc failed with code 1  
note: gcc arguments: -LC:/Program Files (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -m32 -o ./helloworld ./helloworld.o -LC:/Program Files (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -lcore-14bd852465126fe7-0.1 -LC:/Program Files (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -lstd-79ca5fac56b63fde-0.1 -lm -lrustrt -lmorestack  
note: gcc: error: Files: No such file or directory  
gcc: error: (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin: No such file or directory  
gcc: error: Files: No such file or directory  
gcc: error: (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin: No such file or directory  
gcc: error: Files: No such file or directory  
gcc: error: (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin: No such file or directory  
error: aborting due to previous errors
```

### Cause
The error is caused by the `gcc` linker misinterpreting the file paths that contain spaces. Specifically, the paths `C:/Program Files (x86)/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin` are being split into multiple arguments, leading to the "No such file or directory" errors.

### Solution
To resolve this issue, you need to enclose the file paths in double quotes. This ensures that the paths are treated as single arguments, even if they contain spaces.

#### Corrected Command
```sh
rustc helloworld.rs -C link-args="-LC:/\"Program Files (x86)\"/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -m32 -o ./helloworld ./helloworld.o -LC:/\"Program Files (x86)\"/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -lcore-14bd852465126fe7-0.1 -LC:/\"Program Files (x86)\"/Rust/bin/rustc/i686-pc-mingw32/bin -lstd-79ca5fac56b63fde-0.1 -lm -lrustrt -lmorestack"
```

Alternatively, you can set the `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the necessary directories, which can simplify the command:

#### Setting the Environment Variable
```sh
set LIBRARY_PATH=C:\\"Program Files (x86)"\Rust\bin\rustc\i686-pc-mingw32\bin
rustc helloworld.rs
```

By using one of these methods, you should be able to successfully compile your Rust program without encountering the "No such file or directory" errors.
