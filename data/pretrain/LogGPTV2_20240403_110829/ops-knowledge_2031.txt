It seems like you are experiencing a "resource temporarily unavailable" issue while using uWSGI with the following network configuration:

- `net.core.somaxconn = 1024`
- `net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 1000`

To address this, you can try increasing the `listen` value in your uWSGI configuration file. The default value of 100 may be too low for your workload. Increasing this value can help handle a higher number of concurrent connections.

Additionally, here is the output of your `df -h` command, which shows the disk usage:

```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda1      7.8G  2.1G  5.6G  28% /
devtmpfs        1.9G   12K  1.9G   1% /dev
tmpfs           1.9G   16K  1.9G   1% /dev/shm
```

Based on the disk usage, it does not appear that you are running out of disk space. However, to further troubleshoot and resolve the "resource temporarily unavailable" issue, consider the following steps:

1. **Increase the `listen` Value:**
   - In your uWSGI configuration file, increase the `listen` value. For example:
     ```ini
     [uwsgi]
     listen = 500
     ```

2. **Check System Limits:**
   - Ensure that your system's file descriptor limits are sufficient. You can check and modify these limits by editing `/etc/security/limits.conf` and adding or modifying the following lines:
     ```plaintext
     * soft nofile 65536
     * hard nofile 65536
     ```
   - Apply the changes by restarting the system or logging out and back in.

3. **Tune Kernel Parameters:**
   - You have already set `net.core.somaxconn` and `net.core.netdev_max_backlog`. Ensure these settings are applied by adding them to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
     ```plaintext
     net.core.somaxconn = 1024
     net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 1000
     ```
   - Apply the changes with:
     ```sh
     sudo sysctl -p
     ```

4. **Monitor System Resources:**
   - Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or `vmstat` to monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage. This can help identify if other resources are being exhausted.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "resource temporarily unavailable" issue and improve the performance of your uWSGI setup.
