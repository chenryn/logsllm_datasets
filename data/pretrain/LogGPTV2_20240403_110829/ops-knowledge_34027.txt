User: When using pip to install mysql-python in virtualenv on ubuntu, the install goes through successfully but with the following warnings:
warning: no files found matching 'MANIFEST'
warning: no files found matching 'ChangeLog'
warning: no files found matching 'GPL'
Anyone know why? is it something I need to worry about?
Assistant: Those files aren't important for running MySQLdb, but they should be included, and I'll fix this for the next release if possible. (Fixed in the 1.2.4 betas)
