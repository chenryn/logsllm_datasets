### Abstract
To mitigate the risk of account compromise, Facebook introduced a form of two-factor authentication known as social authentication (SA), where users must identify photos of their friends to complete a login attempt. Recent research has shown that attackers can bypass this mechanism using face recognition software. In this paper, we present an alternative attack that uses image comparison techniques to identify SA photos within an offline collection of the user's photos.

We revisit the concept of SA and design a system with a novel photo selection and transformation process to generate challenges that are robust against these attacks. Our approach selects photos that fail software-based face recognition but remain recognizable to humans familiar with the depicted individuals. The photo transformation process creates challenges in the form of photo collages, where faces are altered to render image matching techniques ineffective.

Our experimental results confirm the robustness of our approach: three template matching algorithms solve only 0.4% of the challenges, requiring four orders of magnitude more processing effort. Furthermore, face detection software fails to detect any faces in the transformed images. User studies show that participants can identify their friends in over 99% of the untransformed photos and over 94% of the transformed photos.

### 1. Introduction
The proliferation of personal information on online social networks (OSNs) and the inherent trust users place in communications from their contacts make compromised profiles a valuable resource for criminals. Additionally, the widespread use of single-sign-on services offered by popular OSNs further increases the value of user profiles. Researchers have designed various systems to detect compromised accounts, but preventing unauthorized access in a user-friendly manner remains a challenge.

Facebook introduced social authentication (SA) as a countermeasure, which is a variant of two-factor authentication. Users are required to identify their contacts in a series of photos. While SA offers a user-friendly mechanism to strengthen the login process, recent research has highlighted its vulnerabilities, particularly to attacks using face recognition software.

We demonstrate a new attack that builds a collection of the victim's and their friends' photos and then identifies the SA photos via image comparison. This attack is more effective than previous ones, as it can accurately identify photos even when no faces are present.

In this paper, we revisit the concept of SA and build a system that retains its usability while being robust against attacks employing image analysis software. We conduct a user study to understand the ability of users to identify their friends in photos taken under realistic, non-ideal conditions. Photos are categorized as "simple," "medium," or "difficult" based on the quality of the faces. While traditional SA uses simple photos, we focus on medium and difficult categories. Users solve over 99% of medium and 82% of difficult challenges, indicating their ability to identify friends based on secondary features, associative information, or memory retrieval.

Based on these insights, we redesign the photo selection and transformation processes. Our prototype implementation superimposes selected medium faces over random background photos, making the overlayed faces transparent and applying perspective transformations to hinder pattern matching.

Experiments using real data show that our system completely hinders the face recognition attack and reduces the success of the image comparison attack to 0.4%, requiring four orders of magnitude more processing effort. A preliminary user study confirms that users can still identify famous people in 94.38% of the transformed challenges.

Finally, we discuss the applicability of our approach as a security service offered by OSNs to other websites, such as user-specific CAPTCHA services or additional security measures for high-value services like banking websites.

### 2. Attacking Social Authentication
Photo-based authentication in OSNs was first introduced in 2008 by Yardi et al. In 2010, Facebook deployed its SA application to prevent adversaries from using stolen credentials. When a login attempt is suspicious, the system presents the user with a series of 7 pages, each containing 3 photos of a friend and 6 potential answers. The user must correctly identify the friends in at least 5 of the pages.

#### Face Recognition Attack
Previous work demonstrated that anyone can solve SA challenges by collecting publicly available data and using off-the-shelf face recognition software. Our estimations showed that 84% of Facebook users are susceptible to this attack.

#### Image Comparison Attack
Attacking SA can also be done using more effective photo matching techniques. The attacker creates a collection of the victim's friends' photos and tag information. When SA is triggered, the attacker identifies the presented photos within the collection and uses the tag information to answer the challenge.

This attack is effective even when the challenges contain faces that cannot be identified via face recognition. The success rate is proportional to the coverage of photos, which can be increased by using fake accounts to befriend the victim's friends. According to a study, 63% of photos have privacy settings different from what users intended, with 51% set to public.

We conducted experiments using a simple pixel comparison technique on collections of varying sizes, up to 40,000 photos. The results show that the attack is highly effective, with 98.4% of photos identified in collections of 10,000 or more.

| Collection Size | Identified Photos |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5,000           | 98.8%             |
| 10,000          | 98.4%             |
| 20,000          | 98.4%             |
| 30,000          | 98.4%             |
| 40,000          | 98.4%             |

These findings highlight the need for a more robust SA mechanism, which we address in the subsequent sections.
