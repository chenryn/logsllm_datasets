Abstract
In an eﬀort to hinder attackers from compromising user
accounts, Facebook launched a form of two-factor authen-
tication called social authentication (SA), where users are
required to identify photos of their friends to complete a
log-in attempt. Recent research, however, demonstrated that
attackers can bypass the mechanism by employing face recog-
nition software. Here we demonstrate an alternative attack
that employs image comparison techniques to identify the
SA photos within an oﬄine collection of the users’ photos.
In this paper, we revisit the concept of SA and design
a system with a novel photo selection and transformation
process, which generates challenges that are robust against
these attacks. The intuition behind our photo selection
is to use photos that fail software-based face recognition,
while remaining recognizable to humans who are familiar
with the depicted people. The photo transformation process
creates challenges in the form of photo collages, where faces
are transformed so as to render image matching techniques
ineﬀective. We experimentally conﬁrm the robustness of our
approach against three template matching algorithms that
solve 0.4% of the challenges, while requiring four orders of
magnitude more processing eﬀort. Furthermore, when the
transformations are applied, face detection software fails to
detect even a single face. Our user studies conﬁrm that users
are able to identify their friends in over 99% of the photos

INTRODUCTION
The abundance of personal information uploaded to online
social networks (OSN), coupled with the inherent trust that
users place into communications received from their contacts,
has rendered compromised proﬁles a lucrative resource for
criminals [23]. Moreover, the widespread adoption of single-
sign on services oﬀered by popular OSNs, makes user proﬁles
even more valuable. Consequently, researchers designed var-
ious systems for detecting compromised accounts [10, 13].
However, preventing unauthorized access in a user-friendly
manner remains an open problem. To safeguard proﬁles
against attackers that have stolen user credentials Face-
book deployed a countermeasure called social authentication
(SA) [21]. This is basically a variant of the traditional two-
factor authentication scheme (e.g., [3, 5]), which requires
users to identify their contacts in a series of photos.
Social authentication is a promising approach, as it oﬀers
a user-friendly mechanism to strengthen the login process.
Researchers, however, have analyzed [16] its weaknesses, and
demonstrated [20] that the existing system is vulnerable to
attacks that employ face recognition software. We further
demonstrate that SA is vulnerable to an attack that previous
work has overlooked; the adversary ﬁrst builds a collection of
the photos uploaded by the victim and his online friends. The
adversary can then solve the challenges by identifying the
photos within the collection via image comparison, and using
the tag information to select the correct answer. Compared to
the previous attack, this attack has an important advantage:
the identiﬁcation of photos within a collection based on
image comparison techniques is far more accurate than face
recognition, and eﬀective even when no faces are present.
In this paper, we revisit the concept of SA and build a
system that retains the usability of the existing mechanism,
while being robust to attacks employing image analysis soft-
ware. We conduct a user study that provides us with valuable
information regarding a critical aspect of our approach to
SA; the ability of users to identify their friends in photos
taken under realistic, non-ideal conditions. The participants’
photos are processed by state of the art face recognition
software and categorized as “simple” , “medium” or “diﬃcult”,
based on the quality of the faces found (if any). While SA
picks simple photos, we focus on the medium and diﬃcult
categories. Users solve over 99% of the medium and 82%
of the diﬃcult challenges, indicating their ability to identify
their friends even when their faces are not clearly visible,
based on secondary features (e.g., posture, hair), associative
information (e.g., pets, objects) or memory retrieval (users
remember having seen the photos). On the other hand, face
recognition software fails to identify the users in such photos.
Analysis of the results of the user study and the charac-
teristics of the two attacks provides signiﬁcant insight that
allows us to design a secure, yet usable, system that ren-
ders the attacks ineﬀective. First, we redesign the photo
selection procedure, which processes photos with face recog-
nition software, and selects those that contain faces but are
not recognizable by face recognition software (i.e., medium
photos). Next, we apply a novel transformation process for
creating the SA challenges, which hinders image comparison
techniques from mapping them to the original photos.
Our prototype implementation creates SA challenges by
superimposing the selected medium faces (tags) over the faces
of a random “background” photograph. The overlayed faces
are made transparent so as to blend in with the underlying
faces. Then, a perspective transformation is performed on the
photo, which prohibits even highly resilient pattern matching
approaches, like template matching, from mapping them to
the original photos.
Subsequently, we conduct an extensive set of experiments
using real data, to measure how various levels and combina-
tions of the transformations impact the attacks. The results
demonstrate the robustness of our challenges, as our system
completely hinders the face recognition attack that fails to
detect any faces. The challenges are even robust against
the image comparison attack that employs three template
matching algorithms; all three pass less than 2% of the chal-
lenges with two tags, and 0.4% of those with three tags, while
requiring four orders of magnitude more processing eﬀort
than against the non-processed photos.
To verify that people depicted in the photos remain iden-
tiﬁable after the transformations, we conduct a preliminary
user study where users are asked to identify famous people
in a series of challenges. Results verify the usability of our
system, with users solving 94.38% of the challenges.
Finally, we discuss the applicability of our approach as
a security service oﬀered by an OSN to other websites. In
our vision, this mechanism can be adopted by web services
as a user-speciﬁc CAPTCHA service, or even by high value
services (e.g., banking websites) as a security measure addi-
tional to two-factor authentication. We discuss its robustness
against attacks that break traditional CAPTCHAs, like out-
sourcing attacks, and argue that it is a user-friendly and
secure alternative to existing schemes.
In summary, the key contributions of this work are:
• We demonstrate a novel attack technique against social
authentication, that is more eﬀective and eﬃcient than
the one previously presented.
• We conduct the ﬁrst user study that explores the ability
of humans to identify their acquaintances in photos
taken under realistic, non-ideal conditions. Our results
demonstrate that humans solve this task eﬀectively,
even when no faces are in the photos.
• Based on the insights derived from our experiments, we
design a secure, yet usable SA mechanism, that relies
on a novel tag selection and transformation process. We
experimentally evaluate our proof-of-concept implemen-
tation which completely hinders the face recognition,
and reduces the success of the image comparison attack
to 0.4%, while requiring four orders of magnitude more
processing eﬀort from the attacker.
• To verify the usability of our system, we conduct a
preliminary user study where users solve 94.38% of the
challenges with transformed photos.
2. ATTACKING SOCIAL AUTHENTICATION
Photo-based authentication in OSNs was ﬁrst presented
in 2008 by Yardi et al. [27]. In 2010 Facebook deployed its
SA application in an eﬀort to prevent adversaries from using
stolen credentials. In a nutshell, when a login attempt is
considered suspicious, the system presents the user with a
series of 7 pages, each containing 3 photos of a friend and 6
potential answers. The user is required to correctly identify
the friends depicted in at least 5 of the pages.
Face Recognition Attack. In previous work we demon-
strated that practically anybody can solve SA challenges, by
collecting publicly available data and employing oﬀ-the-shelf
face recognition software [20]. The photos and their tags
are used to train face recognition classiﬁers, which can iden-
tify the friends depicted in SA challenges. Our estimations
showed that 84% of Facebook users are susceptible to this
attack.
Image Comparison Attack. Attacking SA needn’t rely
on face recognition, as more eﬀective photo matching tech-
niques can be used instead. The attacker ﬁrst creates a
collection with all the victim’s friends’ photos he can access,
along with the tag information. When SA is triggered, the
attacker identiﬁes the presented photos within the collection,
and uses the tag information to answer the challenge.
The advantage of this attack is its eﬀectiveness even when
the challenges contain faces that cannot be identiﬁed via
face recognition. Regardless of the content the adversary can
pass the challenge if some of the photos are in the collection
(at least 1 of the 3 photos, in 5 of the 7 pages). The attack
success is proportional to the coverage of photos. This can

be increased by employing fake accounts to befriend the
victim’s friends. However, publicly available photos are a
good resource for the attack. According to [18], the authors
found that 63% of the photos have privacy settings diﬀerent
from what the users intended. Alarmingly, the privacy setting
for 51% of those photos was set to public, allowing anyone
to access them. Thus, overall, about 1 out of every 3 photos
will be publicly viewable by accident. Nonetheless, previous
work (e.g., [6, 7, 14, 25]) has extensively demonstrated the
eﬀectiveness of employing fake accounts to befriend users of
OSNs, and have reported success rates of up to 90%.
Various image comparison techniques can be used for this
attack. Here we demonstrate its eﬀectiveness even when
employing a simplistic pixel comparison. We assume the
attacker has access to all of the user’s photos (we retain
the same assumption when defending against this attack in
Section 4.3). Experiments were conducted on a 4-core Intel R(cid:13)

We build collections of varying sizes, and create 100 SA
challenges from each collection. The collections are up to
40,000 photos, which is higher than the average from our
user study (Section 3.2). We employ a simple and fast
