The current behavior of init containers is to run a set of init containers for
every pod.
It would be nice if the behavior could be extended so that we can define a set
of init containers for a deployment. This would be extremely useful if we have
an app that talks to a database and would need to run database migrations or
perform some action or task exclusively for the whole deployment during
startup. We can then run these tasks in an init container, but only in 1
container per deployment.
