Question: "Consider a scenario where a Mac with Apple silicon is in use. How does enabling or disabling FileVault affect the encryption and security of the system's internal storage, and what is the role of Secure Enclave in this context?"
 "A": "When FileVault is off, the volume encryption key is only protected by the hardware UID, and enabling FileVault later will secure the volume with both the user's password and hardware UID."
 "B": "FileVault uses the Secure Enclave to perform all encryption and decryption operations, thus exposing encryption keys to the main CPU."
 "C": "Disabling FileVault immediately decrypts the contents of the internal storage and removes all encryption keys from the Secure Enclave."
 "D": "FileVault's encryption keys are stored outside the Secure Enclave for ease of access and are not involved in the boot process."
Answer: A
