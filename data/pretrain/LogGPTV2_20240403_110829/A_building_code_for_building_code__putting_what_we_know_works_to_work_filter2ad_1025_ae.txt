“That’s  astounding.  And  it’s  not  even  the  most  fuel-
efficient car in its class … This yearling moose of a car 
gets about the same fuel economy as a Ford Fiesta and, if 
you didn’t know [it] was a hybrid, you wouldn’t guess. 
“You  know  what’s  even  more  astounding?  Recall  the 
legions  of  entrenched  industry  forces  who,  two  decades 
ago, swore on their professional lives that increased fuel-
economy  standards  would  drive  up 
the  cost  of 
automobiles  while  making  them  boring  and  less  safe.  
Yeah, that didn’t happen at all. 
“In  fact,  the  opposite  has  happened.  Cars  have  gotten 
more  fuel  efficient  and  more  powerful,  and  quite 
measurably safer in every type of collision… And, by the 
way, the car business is booming.”[43] 
My point is not that you should buy this car, but that regulation, 
including  self-regulation,  does  not  have  to  imply  a  drag  on 
technology and creativity. It can, and in this particular case, seems 
in  fact  to  have  served  exactly  as  a  spur  to  creativity,  providing 
engineers and companies the incentive to move their technology 
in directions that might otherwise have been unexplored and are 
now providing substantial benefits to society and to the companies 
that took up the challenge. 
I  think  we  should  strive  to  provide  the  same  kind  of  creative 
stimulus to the engineering of secure software that we provided to 
the  engineering  of  fuel-efficient  cars,  and  that  if  we  do,  our 
creative engineers can provide the same kind of results.   
I am not naïve enough to think that this will be an easy process or 
that it will result in systems with perfect security. But we can and 
must  do  better,  much  better,  particularly  in  the  area  of  critical 
infrastructure software, than we have done to date.  
There is no reason we need to view security vulnerabilities as an 
inevitable  disease  against  which  we  must  routinely  invest  in 
weekly  or  monthly  flu  shots. 
  These  vulnerabilities  are 
engineering  defects  that  have  grown  to  the  point  where  they 
provide a fertile field for organized crime and a substantial lever 
to  groups  or  nations  who  would  steal  one  another’s  intellectual 
property and potentially attack each other’s critical infrastructures. 
As engineers and computer scientists, we have a responsibility to 
act on our knowledge. I propose that we begin to act by creating a 
credible building code for building code.

I  thank  Charles  Payne  and  the  ACSAC  organizers  for  the 
invitation that led me to put these thoughts in print. I also thank 
Hilary  Orman,  Susan  Landau,  and  Terrry  Benzel,  organizers  of 
the GREPSEC workshop, where I presented some initial ideas on 
this topic, and Bill Scherlis, who chaired discussions on building 
codes  at  the  2012  NSF  Secure  and  Trustworthy  Cyberspace 
Principal  Investigators  meeting.  Comments  from  Jeremy  Epstein 
and  Christoph  Schuba  helped  me  broaden  the  coverage  and 
sharpen 
the  analysis.  Marvin  Michalsen,  AIA,  provided 
perspectives  on  building  codes.  All  opinions  and  all  remaining 
errors, remain my sole responsibility.
