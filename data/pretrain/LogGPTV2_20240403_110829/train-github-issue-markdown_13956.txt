While using the new version of ListItem this bit of code resulted in the
following error **uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: ReactMount: Two valid
but unequal nodes with the same`data-reactid`**  
Note that this ListItem itself was nested in other lists and cards. Funny
thing is the same code worked with the earlier version of material-ui. Just
wondering what changed and what I can do to fix this?
