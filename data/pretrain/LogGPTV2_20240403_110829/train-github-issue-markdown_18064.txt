Currently the scheduler through the `Threads.@spawn` macro will assign to
random thread #'s, including the primary thread. There may be times where
there is a "traffic cop" activity on Thread 1 that can be impacted if a heavy-
computational (in essence, blocking) task is put onto that thread. It would be
nice if there was a way to cordon off Thread 1 from spawning in those cases.
