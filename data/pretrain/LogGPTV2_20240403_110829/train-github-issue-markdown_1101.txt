I already have LLVM installed, and I would prefer not to download, configure, compile, and install a duplicate version, as this process can take several hours. While I understand that the automatic installation is a great convenience for many Julia users, it would be helpful if the Makefiles could be modified to check for an existing LLVM installation before proceeding with a new one. For example, the Makefiles could use a command like `which llvm-gcc` to detect whether LLVM is already present on the system. This way, users who already have a suitable version of LLVM installed can avoid unnecessary duplication.
