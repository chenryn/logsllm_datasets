I already have LLVM installed. I'd rather not download, configure, compile,
and install a duplicate LLVM, wasting several hours. I realize that it's an
incredible help to do this automatically for Julia users, but for those that
already have LLVM version Whatever, could the Makefiles be modified to only
install LLVM if it's not already on the system? E.g. `which llvm-gcc`.
