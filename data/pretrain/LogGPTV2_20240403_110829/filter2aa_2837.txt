TRACKING THE SKY SPIES
How do we more generally detect surveillance aircraft and
activity?
Registrations can be changed and obscured
Many surveillance technologies are commercially available
How much surveillance is happening in other parts of the world?
Technical and operational requirements dictate ight patterns
Surveillance ights look very dierent from most other trac

TRACKING AIRCRAFT
Tracking aircraft - radar is not practical for hobbyists
Aircraft transponders transmit a beacon signal with a unique
identier (ICAO address)
Protocol: 
Positions can be calculated with 
Compare time dierence of messages arriving at multiple
receivers
Requires 4+ receivers for accurate calculation
Aggregator networks collect feeds from ADS-B receivers and
calculate aircraft positions
Some aircraft also transmit additional information: (latitude /
longitude), call sign, altitude, etc.
Currently not required for all aircraft, and may not be accurate
Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B)
multilateration
GATHERING ADS-B DATA AT SCALE
Active community of radio / aviation / hacking enthusiasts collect
ADS-B data
Requires a Raspberry Pi 1B+, an RTL-SDR radio, antenna, and
internet connection ( 90 degrees
Conditional based on altitude
Sweet spot is appx. 6,000 - 12,000 ft
Future renements:
Consider proximity to airports and controlled airspace
Score based on aircraft model
Increase score if on FAA block list
Additional geometric calulations to lter out survey activity
Compare ights to interesting geography -- borders, events, etc.
PATTERN BASED DETECTION
Surveillance ights make a large number of turns
Most ights with 30+ turns "look" like surveillance ights

NOTES, LINKS, AND ERRATA:
Airworthiness records in the US are available at
A recent copy of the FAA's block list is available on 
,
thanks to a request from Tony Webster
The discussion of ADS-B skipped over mentioning 
transmissions
Mode-S is a simpler protocol that does not include location
data, but transmissions are locatable with multilateration
The slide "Phoenix PD Plane" was edited to add video links, and
various other links were added for reference
The aircraft shown in the "Example" slide was speculated to be
conducting speed patrols, but we believe it to be unlikely based on
further research
Machine learning is another avenue for improvement
"LETC" was spelled out
