sition strategies. Equally important, 39% of new passwords
achieved the highest possible strength score (up from 3%
for the original passwords), a potential sign of the growing
prevalence of password managers that automatically compose
strong passwords. Our results highlight how surfacing action-
able security information can help mitigate the risk of account
hijacking.

Inﬂuence of domains on account security
Category: We examine whether the perceived value of an
account inﬂuences the rate that users rely on reused, breached
credentials. To do this, we manually labeled the top 332 do-
mains that received more than 5,000 logins during our mea-
surement period into one of thirteen categories (e.g., ﬁnance,
email and messaging, and social networking). We used a catch
all “Other” category for domains that fell outside this cate-
gorization. Combined, logins to these domains accounted for
41% of lookups against our API.
We present a breakdown of the aggregate warning rates
and ignore rates across all domains per category in Table 4.
Domains that we categorized as related to ﬁnance or govern-
ments exhibited the lowest rate of reused, breached credentials
(0.2–0.3%). Possible explanations include the password com-
position policies of these domains, the fact that users adhere
to popular security advice to have one strong password for
their bank, or that the sites actively identify breaches and
previously forced password resets. In contrast, entertainment
sites like streaming video platforms and adult websites had
the highest warning rate for breached credentials (3.6–6.3%).
Users may adopt disposable passwords due to perceived lack
Figure 6: CCDF of the percentage of logins per domain that
result in a warning across. We group domains by the volume
of logins we observed, including 100-1,000, 1,000–10,000,
and 10,000+. Popular sites tend to face less of a threat from
credential stufﬁng, while the long tail of domains remain at
risk.
of risk, or in the case of streaming sites, they may use shared
accounts. Surprisingly, users ignored our breach warnings
nearly uniformly across categories, with the exception of adult
websites. For the latter, users ignored nearly twice as many
of our warnings—potentially to hide the domain from our
persistent warning tray (see Figure 3 earlier).
Popularity: We also consider whether more popular sites are
less vulnerable to credential stufﬁng. We present a CCDF of
the frequency of warnings per domain versus the volume of
logins to the domain during our analysis window in Figure 6.
We ﬁnd that just 6% of domains with 10,000+ logins have a
warning rate higher than 3%, compared to 15% of domains
with fewer than 10,000+ logins. We believe this gap in se-
curity results from larger security investments on the part of
popular domains towards proactively resetting passwords and
helping users avoid “weak” passwords. While large identity
providers can equally take advantage of our API, addressing
the long tail of domains affected by credential stufﬁng likely
requires relying on in-browser warnings.

Account hijacking threats: Credential stufﬁng represents
just one dimension of account hijacking threats. Other risks
include large-scale phishing [7, 51], credential or token theft
from local machines [50], and even targeted attacks [35, 40].
Users have internalized these risks and adopted a security
model of joint responsibility between themselves and identity
providers [47]. The most prominent solutions to these threats
include users adopting two-factor authentication, or identity
providers expanding authentication to include other passive

factors such as a user’s device and location [12, 17]. The
protections we propose in this work are complementary to a
defense in depth authentication model, where breach detection
represents one additional factor in risk modeling.
Password reuse behaviors: Text passwords continue to be
the prevailing mechanism for online authentication. Given
the human constraints of memorizing a large number of
unique text strings, people have adopted various strategies—
including reuse and weak patterns—for managing their grow-
ing number of online identities [18, 23, 49, 55]. Florencio and
Herley published the ﬁrst large-scale study of password be-
havior, where they found both weak and reused passwords
were a frequent ﬂaw [16]. More recently, Wash et al. [56] and
Pearman et al. [44] observed the password usage behaviors of
hundreds of participants over multiple weeks. They estimated
that 32% of all entered passwords involved exact reuse. Wash
et al. found that users reused their most popular password on
an average of 9 sites. Examining breach data directly, Das
et al. found that 43–51% of users reused the same password
on multiple sites [10]. While automated password ﬁlling has
become more commonplace—participants used these means
57% of the time [44]—both Pearman et al. and Wash et al.
found password managers have yet to be adopted as a tool
for password generation. All of these factors compound the
threat of credential stufﬁng, where inverting a single weak
password hash can grant an attacker access to multiple sites.
Improving breach alerting protocols: In a contemporane-
ous work, Li et al. presented a framework for reasoning about
leakages resulting from the password-based preﬁxes used by
our protocol and HaveIBeenPwned [33]. The authors show
how a password-only preﬁx (or an attacker with access to the
plaintext username in a username-password preﬁx) can lever-
age a partition’s underlying password distribution to reduce
the number of guesses necessary to potentially learn a user’s
password. To address this, the authors outline a zero-password
leakage variant that relies on private set membership in con-
junction with a username hash preﬁx for partitioning, akin to
our own model from Section 3.2. Their work provides further
motivation for a zero-password leakage protocol, despite its
additional computational complexity as we outlined.
8 Conclusion
In this paper, we demonstrated the feasibility of a privacy-
preserving protocol that allows a client to query whether their
login credentials were exposed in a breach, without revealing
the information queried. Our protocol relies on a combina-
tion of computationally expensive hashing, k-anonymity, and
private set intersection. Our approach improves on existing
protocols by taking into account both an adversarial client and
server, while also minimizing the chance of false positives. We
envision this service being used by end users, password man-
agers, and by identity providers. As a proof-of-concept, we
created a cloud service that mediates access to 4 billion user-
names and passwords publicly exposed by breaches. We then
released a Chrome extension that would query credentials
entered at login time against our service. Based on telemetry
produced by nearly 670,000 users, we estimated that 1.5% of
credentials used across the web are vulnerable to credential
stufﬁng (based on a sample of 21 million logins).
Addressing this problem requires action from both users
and identity providers. In the context of our study, 26% of the
warnings we generated for breached passwords resulted in
users adopting a new password—94% of which were stronger
or as strong as the original. Both the volume of user inter-
est and response rate surfaced during our study demonstrate
that there is an appetite on the part of users to secure their
accounts from credential stufﬁng. We hope that by making

our protocol public, other researchers can improve on the
privacy protections, computational bounds, and cost models
that we establish. Our protocol is a ﬁrst step in democratizing
access to breach alerting in order to mitigate one dimension
of account hijacking.
