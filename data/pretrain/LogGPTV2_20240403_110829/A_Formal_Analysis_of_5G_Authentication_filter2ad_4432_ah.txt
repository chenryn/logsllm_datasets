We now list the security goals in terms of authentication by
pairs of entities. Note that the specification considers some au-
thentication properties to be implicit. This means that the guaran-
tee is provided only after an additional key confirmation roundtrip
(w.r.t. KSEAF) between the subscribers and the SN. We discuss and
criticize this design choice in Section 5.
Authentication between subscribers and HNs. First, the subscribers
must have the assurance that authentication can only be successful
with SNs authorized by their HNs.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.1.2] Serving network authorization
by the home network: Assurance shall be provided to the
UE that it is connected to a serving network that is autho-
rized by the home network to provide services to the UE. This
authorization is ‘implicit’ in the sense that it is implied by a
successful authentication and key agreement run.

[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.1.1.3] The binding to the serving network
prevents one serving network from claiming to be a different
serving network, and thus provides implicit serving network
authentication to the UE.
Formally, a subscriber must obtain non-injective agreement on
SNname with its HN after key confirmation.
In 5G, the trust assumptions are balanced differently than in
previous standards (e.g., 3G or 4G). Most notably, the level of trust
the system needs to put into SNs has been reduced. One important
property provided by 5G is that a SN can no longer fake authenti-
cation requests with the HNs for subscribers that are not attached
to one of its base station:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.1.4.1] Increased home control: The au-
thentication and key agreement protocols mandated to pro-
vide increased home control [compared to previous gen-
erations]. The feature of increased home control is use-
ful in preventing certain types of fraud, e.g. fraudulent
Nudm_UECM_Registration Request for registering the sub-
scriber’s serving AMF in UDM that are not actually present
in the visited network.
Formally, the HNs obtain aliveness of its subscribers at that SN,
which is non-injective agreement on SNname from the HNs’ point of
view with the subscribers.
Authentication between subscribers and SNs. As expected, the SNs
shall be able to authenticate the subscribers:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.1.2] Subscription authentication: The
serving network shall authenticate the Subscription Perma-
nent Identifier (SUPI) in the process of authentication and key
agreement between UE and network.
Formally, the SNs must obtain non-injective agreement on SUPI
with the subscribers, which is weak agreement from the SNs towards
subscribers (since the SUPI is the subscriber’s identifier).
Conversely, the subscribers shall be able to authenticate the SNs:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.1.2] Serving network authentication:
The UE shall authenticate the serving network identifier
through implicit key authentication.
NOTE 1: The meaning of ’implicit key authentication’ here
is that authentication is provided through the successful use
of keys resulting from authentication and key agreement in
subsequent procedures.
NOTE 2: The preceding requirement does not imply that
the UE authenticates a particular entity, e.g. an AMF, within
a serving network.
Formally, and because SNname is the SN’s identifier, the sub-
scribers must obtain weak agreement with the SNs after key confir-
mation.
Authentication between SNs and HNs. The SNs shall be able to
authenticate the subscribers that are authorized by their corre-
sponding HN:
19
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.1.2] UE authorization: The serving net-
work shall authorize the UE through the subscription profile
obtained from the home network. UE authorization is based
on the authenticated SUPI.
Formally, the SNs must obtain non-injective agreement on SUPI
with the HNs.
D.2.2 Confidentiality Properties. While it is not clearly specified,
it is obviously the case that 5G authentication methods should
achieve secrecy of KSEAF, K, and skHN. We recall similar goals for
3G:
[TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.3] (3G) The following security features
are provided with respect to confidentiality of data on the
network access link:
• cipher algorithm agreement: the property that the MS and
the SN can securely negotiate the algorithm that they shall
use subsequently;
• cipher key agreement: the property that the MS and the SN
• confidentiality of user data: the property that user data
• confidentiality of signalling data: the property that sig-
nalling data cannot be overheard on the radio access inter-
face.
agree on a cipher key that they may use subsequently;
cannot be overheard on the radio access interface;
5G should ensure that knowing the KSEAF established in a cer-
tain session is insufficient to deduce a KSEAF key that has been
established in a previous session or that will be established in a
later session:
[TS 33.501, Sec. 3] backward security: The property that
for an entity with knowledge of Kn, it is computationally
infeasible to compute any previous Kn−m (m > 0) from which
Kn is derived.
NOTE 5: In the context of KgNB key derivation, backward
security refers to the property that, for a gNB with knowledge
of a KgNB, shared with a UE, it is computationally infeasible
to compute any previous KgNB that has been used between
the same UE and a previous gNB.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 3] forward security: The property that for
an entity with knowledge of Km that is used between that
entity and a second entity, it is computationally infeasible to
predict any future Km+n (n > 0) used between a third entity
and the second entity.
NOTE 6: In the context of KgNB key derivation, forward
security refers to the property that, for a gNB with knowledge
of a KgNB, shared with a UE, it is computationally infeasible
to predict any future KgNB that will be used between the same
UE and another gNB. More specifically, n hop forward security
refers to the property that a gNB is unable to compute keys
that will be used between a UE and another gNB to which the
UE is connected after n or more handovers (n = 1 or more).
A Formal Analysis of 5G Authentication
D. Basin, J. Dreier, L. Hirschi, S. Radomirović, R. Sasse and V. Stettler
Since we do not consider the full key hierarchy and how KgNB
can be derived from KSEAF, we shall consider those properties for
KSEAF directly. Formally, it should be the case that KSEAF established
in a given session remains confidential even when the attacker learns
the KSEAF keys established in all other sessions. Note that this is
different from forward secrecy and post-compromise secrecy [15]
which fail to hold as we shall see in Section 5.1.
Note that some other confidentiality properties are considered
to be privacy properties (see Appendix D.2.3).
D.2.3 Privacy Properties. We first emphasize the importance given
to privacy in 5G:
[TR 33.899, Sec. 4.1,4.2] Subscription privacy deals with var-
ious aspects related to the protection of subscribers’ personal
information, e.g. identifiers, location, data, etc. [...] The se-
curity mechanisms defined in NextGen shall be able to be
configured to protect subscriber’s privacy.
[TR 33.899, Sec. 5.7.1] The subscription privacy is very im-
portant area for Next Generation system as can be seen by
the growing attention towards it, both inside and outside the
3GPP world.
Outside the 3GPP, an alliance of mobile network operators,
vendors, and universities called NGMN [9] has identified secu-
rity and privacy as an enabler and essential value proposition
of NextGen system and has presented that built-in privacy
should be included as a design principle [10]. Similarly, a 5G
PPP project called 5G-Ensure [11] has also identified privacy
as one of the topmost priorities for the NextGen system stat-
ing that the privacy has an important social impact [12]. [...]
[TS 33.501, Sec. F.2] EAP-AKA’ includes optional support
for identity privacy mechanism that protects the privacy
against passive eavesdropping.
This important role given to privacy can be explained by nu-
merous and critical attacks that have breached privacy (e.g., with
IMSI-catcher [35, 36]) in previous generations; see the survey [32].
We also recall that privacy was already a concern in 3G:
[TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.1] (3G) The following security features
related to user identity confidentiality are provided:
• user identity confidentiality: the property that the per-
manent user identity (IMSI) of a user to whom a services is
delivered cannot be eavesdropped on the radio access link;
• user location confidentiality: the property that the pres-
ence or the arrival of a user in a certain area cannot be
determined by eavesdropping on the radio access link;
• user untraceability: the property that an intruder cannot
deduce whether different services are delivered to the same
user by eavesdropping on the radio access link.
Thus, already for 3G, user identity confidentiality, anonymity,
and untraceability were security requirements. However, those
properties were required against a passive attacker only (we discuss
20
and criticize this restriction to a passive attacker in Section 5). Note
that anonymity and untraceability (often called unlinkability) are
not clearly defined. We propose formalization in Section 4.3.
We now list more precise statements specifying how privacy
should be protected in 5G.
Confidentiality of SUPI. In 5G, the SUPI is considered sensitive
and must remain secret since it uniquely identifies users. Indeed,
an attacker who would be able to obtain this value from a sub-
scriber would be able to identify him, leading to classical user
location attacks (i.e., see [TS˙133.102, Sec. 5.1.1] above), much like
IMSI-catcher attacks.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.2.5] The SUPI should not be transferred in
clear text over 5G RAN except routing information, e.g. Mobile
Country Code (MCC) and Mobile Network Code (MNC).
[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.12] Subscription identifier privacy: In
the 5G system, the globally unique 5G subscription permanent
identifier is called SUPI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
The SUCI is a privacy preserving identifier containing the
concealed SUPI. [...]
[TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.1] (3G) User identity confidentiality
(see above).
Formally, the SUPI shall remain secret in the presence of a passive
attacker.
Confidentiality of SQN. For similar reasons, SQN must remain
secret. An additional reason that is not explicitly stated is that SQN
leaks the number of successful authentications the corresponding
USIM has performed since it was manufactured, which is strongly
correlated to its age and activity. This is even more critical when
the attacker learns SQN at different times.
[TS 33.102, Sec. 6.2.3] (3G) Here, AK is an anonymity key
used to conceal the sequence number as the latter may expose
the identity and location of the user. The concealment of the
sequence number is to protect against passive attacks only. If
no concealment is needed then f5 ≡ 0 (AK = 0).
[TS 133.102, Sec. C.3.2] (3G) User anonymity: the value of
SQN may allow to trace the user over longer periods. If this
is a concern then SQN has to be concealed by an anonymity
key as specified in section 6.3.
Formally, the SQN shall remain secret in the presence of a passive
attacker.
Anonymity and Untraceability. Preventing the attacker from
learning pieces of data that are identifying (e.g., SUPI, SQN) is insuffi-
cient to protect against traceability attacks, user location attacks, or
even anonymity attacks (we explain why and discuss definitions in
Section 4.3). While no formal statement is made on the necessity of
ensuring untraceability or anonymity for 5G, the following excerpts
and the fact that it was required for 3G ([TS˙133.102, Sec. 5.1.1], see
A Formal Analysis of 5G Authentication
D. Basin, J. Dreier, L. Hirschi, S. Radomirović, R. Sasse and V. Stettler
This will be analyzed as part of Injective agreement properties
on the established key KSEAF for different pairs of parties.
Finally, 5G specify some security goals in the context of back-
ward compatibility with older generations. We do not analyze those
properties as they would require us to analyze the combination of
the 5G authentication protocols with the older generations authen-
tication protocols. This is left as future work.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 6.1.1.3] Key separation: Furthermore, the
anchor key provided to the serving network shall also be spe-
cific to the authentication having taken place between the
UE and a 5G core network, i.e. the KSEAF shall be crypto-
graphically separate from the key KASME delivered from
the home network to the serving network in earlier mobile
network generations.
[TS 33.501, Sec. 5.11] An attacker could attempt a bidding
down attack by making the UE and the network entities
respectively believe that the other side does not support a
security feature, even when both sides in fact support that
security feature. It shall be ensured that a bidding down attack,
in the above sense, can be prevented.
above), seem to imply that those properties are relevant for 5G as
well.
On untraceability (also called unlinkability): [TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.1],
item 2 and:
[TS 33.501, Sec. C.2] The reason for mentioning the non-
freshness is that, normally, in order to attain unlinkability
(i.e., to make it infeasible for over-the-air attacker to link
SUCIs together), it is necessary for newly generated SUCIs to
be fresh. But, in case of the null-scheme, the SUCI does not
conceal the SUPI. So unlinkability is irrelevant.
[TR 33.899, Sec. 5.2.3.8.2] Security threats: Over-use of a
single UE key-pair may harm user privacy (allowing a user’s
actions to be linked and tracked across multiple domains and
services).
On anonymity: [TS 133.102, Sec. 5.1.1], item 3 and:
[33.849, Sec. 6.4.2] (TR on Privacy in 3GPP, 2016) The UMTS
authentication procedure (TS 33.102 [10]) design is an example
of how to fulfil anonymity:
(1) Analysis of the authentication process: identity and location
of the user may be exposed.
(2) Identify an identifying attribute: sequence number may
bring a risk of personal identification.
(3) Risk: The sequence number may expose the identity
and thus the location of the user.
(4) Anonymizing technique used: use Anonymity Key in the
Authentication Token to conceal (blind) the sequence num-
ber.
[TR 33.899, Sec. 5.1.4.14.3] If there was no single NAS se-
curity termination then the unencrypted part of a signalling
message would have to contain parameters that would allow
routing to the correct NAS entity, e.g. SM entity in a network
slice. This information about the slice may give away infor-
mation on the services used. However, user identity privacy
should prevent that an eavesdropper can associate a particular
signalling message with a particular subscriber. Editor’s Note:
The above paragraph has been included for completeness. It is
ffs whether leaving parameters unencrypted that are required
for NAS-internal routing would endanger privacy.
Formally, it seems that 5G authentication methods are required
to provide anonymity and untraceability of the subscribers in the
presence of a passive attacker.
D.2.4 Other Properties. As specified below, the established keys
should never be the same twice:
[TS 133.102, Sec. 6.2.3] (3G) Key reuse: A wrap around of
the counter SQN could lead to a repeated use of a key pair
(CK, IK). This repeated key use could potentially be exploited
by an attacker to compromise encryption or forge message au-
thentication codes applied to data sent over the 3GPP-defined
air interfaces.
