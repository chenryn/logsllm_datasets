Question: "A software development team is considering the implementation of a security mechanism to protect sensitive data in their new application. They have proposed two different approaches. Evaluate the potential security implications of each approach based on the principles of 'Economy of Mechanism':

Approach 1: Implementing an elaborate encryption scheme with multiple layers of dynamically changing keys and proprietary algorithms to deter reverse engineering.

Approach 2: Utilizing a well-known, standard encryption protocol with a strong track record of security and a straightforward implementation."
 "A": "Approach 1 may be more secure due to its complexity and proprietary nature, making it harder for attackers to understand and exploit."
 "B": "Approach 2 is likely to be more secure, as its simplicity makes it easier to implement correctly and reduces the risk of configuration errors."
 "C": "Approach 1 could result in partial implementations and compatibility problems due to its complexity, leading to potential security vulnerabilities."
 "D": "Approach 2 may introduce vulnerabilities because standard protocols are well-understood by attackers and more likely to be targeted."
