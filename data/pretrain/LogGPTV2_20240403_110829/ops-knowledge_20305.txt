User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Computer not joining domain Since a few days (without any changes on the AD) it's impossible to join a computer in my domain. When I try to do it, after write the domain name, I'm prompted for an account who can join the domain, I complete it and nothing...

I've tried to wait a very long time and it never does anything. 

It's a computer which was in the domain before, but I rejoin the domain because of an error on user logon (approbation between computer and domain not allowed, something like that).

I've checked my AD and it seems everything is ok. It runs on Win 2k12 r2. 

Any ideas?

Assistant: Is this just one machine, or all clients? 
Check your DNS. Make sure the service is running and stop/start netlogon on all DC's - this should ensure all the correct entries required for AD are present - see here

Is there anything in error logs on the DCs or client? It's strange that it hangs indefinitely. That smacks of it getting half way through the bind but not finishing correctly.

Also, do you have multiple sites? If you've deleted the computer account but it hasn't propagated round all sites, and now you are trying to re-add it, AD can get grumpy.
