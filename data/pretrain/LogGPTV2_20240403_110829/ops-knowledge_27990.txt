User: I recently installed Python 3.4 on my Mac and now want to install Django using pip. I tried running pip install Django==1.7.4 from the command line and received the following error:
Exception:

Obviously my path is pointing to the old version of Python that came preinstalled on my computer, but I don't know how to run the pip on the new version of Python. I am also worried that if I change my file path, it will mess up other programs on my computer. Is there a way to point to version 3.4 without changing the file path? If not how do I update my file path to 3.4?
Assistant: Try adding sudo. sudo pip install Django
