To check the Symfony version, you can use the following command:

```bash
./app/console --version
```
This will output the current Symfony version and environment. For example:
```
Symfony version 2.0.0-RC2 - app/dev/debug
```

Next, to generate a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) controller for an entity, run the following command:

```bash
./app/console doctrine:generate:crud
```

This command will create a new controller with the necessary actions for managing the specified entity.
