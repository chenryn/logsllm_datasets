SVC's and LinearSVC's (I didn't check other classifiers) decision_function in
binary classification case returns values lower than 0 when predict returns 0,
and >0 when predict returns 1.  
So this part of code is wrong:
pred = estimators[k].predict(X)  
score = _predict_binary(estimators[k], X)  
scores[:, i] += score  
scores[:, j] -= score  
votes[pred == 0, i] += 1  
votes[pred == 1, j] += 1
In SVM case we should substract score from scores[:,i] and add to scores[:,j]
