User: Please explain what DNS does and how it translates domain names into IP addresses?
Assistant: The role of DNS (Domain Name System) is to convert human-readable domain names (such as www.baidu.com) into computer-recognizable IP addresses (such as 123.125.115.110). This process is also known as domain name resolution. When a computer needs to visit a website, it will first send a request to the local DNS server, asking for the IP address of the website. If the IP address of the domain name has been saved in the local DNS server, it will return the IP address immediately. Otherwise, it will send query requests to other DNS servers, and query step by step until it finds the DNS server that contains the IP address corresponding to the domain name. In general, the DNS system adopts a hierarchical structure: top-level domain name servers (such as root domain name servers) are responsible for managing DNS servers for all top-level domain names, intermediate-level domain name servers are responsible for managing DNS servers for subdomain names, and final DNS servers are responsible for managing DNS servers for specific domain names. host domain name. When a DNS server cannot resolve a domain name, it will send a query request to the upper-level server until it finally finds the IP address corresponding to the domain name.
