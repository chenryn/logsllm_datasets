## 1. Introduction to Censorship Techniques
Various techniques are employed by the Great Firewall (GFW) to block and throttle Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). These include Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), IP address blocking, and bandwidth throttling [30, 33].

### Experimental Setup and Results
In November 2016, we established an OpenVPN server in China and used a node in the United States as the client. Our experimental results showed that a preliminary version of INTANG enabled OpenVPN over TCP to evade censorship, whereas OpenVPN without INTANG was disconnected due to the client receiving a reset packet from the GFW during the handshake phase, indicating the use of DPI.

Unfortunately, recent attempts to replicate these experiments using either the PPTP protocol or OpenVPN have not resulted in disconnections or rate limits imposed by the GFW. The cause of this change in behavior remains unclear, and we plan to continue monitoring the situation to explore the potential for applying INTANG to improve VPN stability.

## 2. Discussion
### GFW Countermeasures
Our work is based on the latest developments of the GFW. It is possible that the GFW may implement additional improvements to counter our evasion strategies, leading to an ongoing arms race. For example, the GFW currently accepts RST packets more liberally than normal servers. If the censor performs additional checks on RST packets (e.g., checksum and MD5 option fields), it could open up new evasion opportunities (e.g., when the server does not check MD5 option fields).

Additionally, the GFW's agnostic nature to network topology can be leveraged. For instance, measuring the exact TTL value to bypass the GFW while not reaching the server can be a strategy, though achieving both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously is challenging.

Another potential improvement the GFW could make is to trust data packets sent by the client only after seeing the server’s ACK packet acknowledging the appropriate sequence number. However, this would significantly complicate the GFW's design and implementation.

In summary, we believe this is an arms race. As the GFW evolves, so too can the evasion strategies. The high cost of rolling out new GFW models means that such evolution will likely occur over months or even years, providing sufficient time for the development of new evasion strategies, especially with tools like INTANG.

### Complexity and Inconsistency of the GFW
Since 2015, we have observed that type-1 and type-2 resets sometimes occur individually. For example, from a vantage point in CERNET Beijing, we observed only type-1 resets on certain days, while on other days, both types were seen. This indicates that the two types of GFW devices are usually deployed together, and sometimes one is down.

During a measurement in May 2016, we found that type-1 GFW devices also had a subsequent 90-second blocking period (which they normally do not) after using our new strategy to evade type-2 devices. When no strategies were used, only the type-2 reset was observed, suggesting that the type-2 reset suppresses the type-1 reset. This rare behavior was not observed during other measurements.

In May 2016 and May 2017, we observed that RST packets sometimes failed to tear down the TCB on the GFW, with different pairs of controlled clients and servers. This inconsistent behavior could be due to load balancing among different versions of the GFW or intricate effects caused by multiple GFW devices deployed together. However, we have no way to determine the ground truth. Our measurements are limited by being agnostic to the interference among different versions of GFW devices and their deployment methods, as well as the black-box nature of the GFW device itself. We plan to further explore this complexity and inconsistency in future work.

### Combination of Strategies
The GFW is heterogeneous, with different co-existing versions. Therefore, it is necessary to combine strategies effective against different versions of the GFW, as we did in this paper. This is generally not an issue as long as the strategies do not conflict with each other. However, employing multiple strategies may increase the "Failure 1" rate due to the increased likelihood of middlebox interference or side-effects on the server.

### Ethical Considerations
All our experiments are carefully designed to avoid disrupting normal network operations. All connections are established from machines that we rent or control directly. The additional insertion packets are regular TCP packets (sometimes with incorrect field values) and may simply be discarded by the server. We control the traffic to each website to be low to avoid any unintended denial-of-service.

Note that INTANG does not guarantee unobservability for all its strategies. Users must decide whether to use INTANG within the censor’s jurisdiction. In China, due to heavy censorship [16], accessing websites like Google and Facebook has become a prevalent need. The censor typically punishes those who provide censorship circumvention services (e.g., proxy/VPN providers) rather than the users. A client-side only tool like INTANG is harder for the censor to trace and thwart.

## 3. Related Work
We have already discussed various related efforts throughout the paper, particularly in § 2. They focus on evaluating censorship techniques or anti-censorship techniques aided by additional facilities like VPNs.

Clayton et al. proposed ignoring RST packets sent by the GFW [10]. This requires server-side cooperation, making it impractical. It also does not prevent the censor from monitoring user traffic. Thus, we do not explicitly consider this in our work.

Ptacek et al. [23] developed a deep understanding of the vulnerabilities of current Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), which has influenced later efforts, including ours, on TCP reset attack evasion. The West Chamber Project [25] implemented Ptacek et al.'s theory but has now become ineffective.

Khattak et al.’s research [17] is the most relevant to ours. Their strategies and associated problems were discussed in § 3. Our measurement utilizes multiple vantage points, leading to the discovery of differences in GFW deployment and features compared to previous work. Li et al. [18] tested known TCP/IP insertion packets against censorship firewalls and DPI boxes in three countries, evaluating their effectiveness. In contrast, our work focuses on understanding and uncovering the latest developments (new state machine) of the largest and most complex censorship system, allowing us to devise new evasion strategies.

## 4. Conclusion
In this paper, we present an in-depth measurement study of stateful (TCP-level) Internet censorship evasion on the GFW of China. Our work is divided into multiple stages. First, we perform extensive measurements of prior approaches and find that they are no longer effective, attributing this to the GFW's evolution and the presence of middleboxes. Second, based on the knowledge gained, we hypothesize about new GFW behaviors and design new strategies that can potentially evade the GFW today. We also build a novel, measurement-driven tool, INTANG, that can converge on the right evasion strategy for a given client-server pair. Finally, we perform extensive measurements of our new strategies and INTANG, demonstrating near-to-perfect evasion rates when combined, thereby validating our new understanding of the GFW’s stateful censorship model.
