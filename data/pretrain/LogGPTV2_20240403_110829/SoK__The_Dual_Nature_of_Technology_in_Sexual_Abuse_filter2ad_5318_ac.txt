physical locations [100], [125]. Technology gives “expanded
access to victims for offenders” [117]. It provides the “ability
by perpetrators to span large distances and involve multiple
parties, to the extent that it outstrips the capabilities of many
[police] agencies” [117].
Perpetrators can continue the abuse of an ex-partner and
blackmail them due to boundlessness. The abuse can continue
long after the relationship has ended. When in a relation-
ship, people may share their online space. However, after
their physical relationship has ended, ending their online
relationship can be complex [67]. Hand et al. explained that,
because of technology, “geographic and spatial boundaries no
longer present a barrier for one to communicate, contact, or
locate another globally” [69]. Technology is “redeﬁning the
boundaries of romantic relationships in ways that provide a
fertile ground for conﬂict and abuse and through providing
opportunities for constant contact through mobile or online
communication technology” [41]. Sometimes abusers still have
access to victims’ previously shared online accounts and can
use the account
the victim into
engaging in sexual acts [55]. Technology, therefore, “lessens
[the] personal sense of privacy boundaries” [50].
information to blackmail
F. Reproducibility
Reproducibility is the ability to duplicate information kept
on the Internet, making the information close to permanent.
Sexual content shared online is easily duplicated, resulting
in revictimization. Perpetrators share sexual images, videos, or
audio recordings of victims on the Internet, where it is easily
reproducible and close to indelible [60], [87], [88], [90], [101],
[102], [115], [126]–[137]. Many research papers document the
difﬁculties victims face in attempting to remove content that
has been reproduced on various online platforms [87], [91],
[102], [137]. In situations of unauthorized duplication and
distribution of sexual content, victims have described feeling
as if the sexual abuse was occurring all over again [90], [100],
[137]–[139].
Because of reproducibility, perpetrators can also blackmail
victims. Perpetrators can coerce victims into engaging in
sexual activities by threatening to share sexual content online
if victims refuse or report the incident to the police [48], [88],
[91], [98], [119], [140]. Afraid the perpetrator will make good
on their threat and that their sensitive information will be
visible online forever [80], victims continue sexual interactions
with perpetrators [90], [106], [117], [128], [140]–[142].
G. Accessibility
Accessibility refers to technology being easily available to
multiple individuals. As a result, perpetrators do not have to
be sophisticated technology users to employ technology for
sexual abuse. “The widespread uptake and everyday use of
smartphones and connected devices in the home means that
stalking and abuse online is no longer solely the domain
of the most ‘tech-savvy’ perpetrator” [48]. The increased
accessibility of technology enables easy monitoring and abuse
of targets and victims [91].
H. Indispensability
The indispensability of technology makes it essential in
everyday life, increasing people’s reliance on technology and
enabling perpetrators to have access to victims consistently as
a result.
The use of technological tools and platforms has become
a necessary part of people’s lives [40]. The overall depen-
dency on technology makes it harder for people to let go
of technological tools while making it easier for perpetrators
to get more targets [94], [123]. Some sexual abuse shelters
request that victims do not use technology in order to prevent
perpetrators from tracing them to their current location or
to shelter facilities. However, victims ﬁnd this request hard
to adhere to [143]. People have become so dependent on
technology that they ﬁnd it challenging to cut themselves off
from it, even if it comes at the risk of sexual abuse [91].
I. Malleability
Malleability refers to how easy digital content can be
tampered with. A picture can be photoshopped; video and
audio content can be altered using artiﬁcial intelligence. Perpe-
trators circulate modiﬁed sexual content of victims to facilitate
revictimization [90].
J. Opaqueness
Opaqueness refers to a system with contents that are mys-
terious to the user. In our case, the system is technology.
The type and volume of user data collected by technological
devices is unclear, and perpetrators use this lack of clarity to
their advantage. For instance, victims in a research study com-
plained their IoT device was collecting data about them. Still,
they could not ﬁgure out or remember what data collection
they had consented to. Sometimes victims had an incomplete
mental model of these devices, and they either underestimated
or overestimated what the device could do [70]. Because the
technological device is opaque to victims, perpetrators make
use of the device to continue surveillance of victims [51], [74].
Further, victims did not know details about the accounts
they shared with the perpetrators, making it easy for the per-
petrators to continue to access their accounts. This opaqueness

made it difﬁcult for victims to cut ties with their abusers;
in turn, the perpetrators continued to surveil and blackmail
victims using their shared accounts [58].
V. RESULTS: HOW TECHNOLOGY ASSISTS VICTIMS
In this section, we present the ways in which technology
assists victims. We classiﬁed the assistance into three broad
categories: (a) investigating abuse, (b) reporting or preventing
abuse, and (c) restricting abuse. We discuss how technology
can assist victims. Importantly, we also describe the challenges
(summarized in Figure 2) that hinder this assistance.
A. Investigating abuse
Digital ﬁles kept on technological tools and platforms can
serve as evidence of sexual abuse to aid investigation [144].
We classiﬁed such evidence into two categories: (i) evidence
that captures the act of sexual abuse, such as images, videos,
and audio ﬁles; and (ii) evidence of the perpetrator’s actions
that facilitate the abuse, such as monitoring or stalking the vic-
tim. Such evidence could include online posts, text messages,
and records of phone calls. For simplicity’s sake, in the rest of
the paper we refer to these categories as sexualabuse_evidence
and preparatoryactivities_evidence. We use the term evidence
to refer to both categories.
Perpetrators and witnesses can record the sexual abuse
incident, which serves as sexualabuse_evidence. Technological
platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube can enable
people to record and post real-time events [145]–[147]. These
recordings can serve as a digital record, showing that the sex-
ual abuse occurred. It is also easy to screenshot or otherwise
save such recordings. Therefore, the evidence can remain, even
after it has been deleted from an online platform [50], [58],
[91], [144].
Such evidence has been helpful to victims in their pur-
suit of justice [50], [91], [144]. Sometimes victims were
unaware they had been raped. For instance, in the Steubenville
sexual abuse incident [126], the perpetrators and complicit
witnesses recorded the repeated sexual abuse of the victim.
The recording was documented through videos, images, text
messages, emails, and online posts that were uploaded on
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter [126]. However, the victim
did not know that she had been raped because she had been
in and out of consciousness at the time. Seeing the videos and
posts online made her realize what had happened [126]. The
perpetrators took down the images and videos before the police
investigation started weeks later [148], but screenshots taken
of the original postings helped to serve as evidence. There
are also many other instances where perpetrators had made
off-line video recordings of themselves committing sexual
abuse crimes. The police discovered these video recordings
during their investigations and used them as evidence of sexual
abuse [78], [144], [149].
Victims can also record sexualabuse_evidence. They have
used their mobile phones to serve as witnesses to the crime
of sexual abuse. For instance, a victim who was being
abused dialed the emergency number under the bedcover,
hoping someone would listen in and piece together what was
happening [41]. In other instances, victims have recorded
incidents [91] or called family and friends while being sexually
abused to make them listen in as evidence of the abuse [41],
[50]. Victims have taken pictures or videos of speciﬁc injuries
they had after sexual abuse happened [90]. Further, victims
have saved text messages or social media posts from abusers
that insinuated sexual abuse had happened [86], [91], [150].
Victims have used such evidence to get a restraining order
against abusers [32] or for investigative purposes [50], [91],
[150].
Online evidence also facilitates digital activism. Joyce
deﬁned digital activism as a “political campaigning prac-
tice that uses digital network infrastructure to pursue social
change” [151]. Victims can use evidence for digital activism
with the hopes of getting justice [58], [152], [153]. For
example, digital activism was used in the Steubenville’s case
“to hold those in power accountable online in ways that bypass
ofﬁcial justice mechanisms” [148]. Sometimes victims have
used social media to tell their stories, which can aid digital
activism [129], [154]. Seeing victims share their stories online
has been a motivating factor for other victims to share their
stories as well [129], [152].
1) Challenges with using technology to investigate abuse:
Here we present the challenges that stakeholders and victims
experience when using technology to investigate abuse, both
during and after the gathering of evidence.
During the gathering of evidence: It is hard for stakehold-
ers to collate evidence because of multiple sources and large
volumes. Sometimes the perpetrator communicates with the
victim on more than one platform. For instance, a conversation
could start via instant messenger and then lead to email ex-
changes or conversations using other technological platforms.
It is also difﬁcult to provide preparatoryactivities_evidence
of communications with the perpetrator because of the sheer
volume of evidence accumulated on various technological plat-
forms [91], [108], particularly in cases of long-term abuse [79].
It is difﬁcult to get the consent and timely cooperation from
various service providers to access evidence that the victim
could need in a court of law [91], [108]. The service providers
can be unresponsive or slow to release the information, and
the process can take many months [79], [91], [128]. In some
cases, victims waited for a long time and eventually withdrew
their sexual abuse reports because they believed they were
not getting justice [155]. In other cases, the service providers
did not keep records of the evidence that the victims or law
enforcement agencies were looking for or did not release the
information because of privacy concerns [91].
Another challenge is that it is the victim’s responsibility to
gather evidence, which can be a difﬁcult task. Evidence gath-
ering is necessary for ﬁnding justice [155]. However, victims
are expected to gather evidence, which puts the responsibility
and onus on them. For instance, regarding preparatoryactivi-
ties_evidence, “many jurisdictions suggest that victims keep a
stalking log to document each stalking incident. By noting the
date, time, location, means of contact, and witnesses” [77].

Fig. 2: Visual summary of challenges with using technology to assist victims (§V)
Further, in the court of law it is mostly a case of the victim’s
words against the perpetrator’s. Victims, therefore, must gather
as much evidence as they can to prove that the perpetrator is
guilty [58]. Such gathering of evidence is often done at the
risk of the victim’s life or with the risk of revictimization [58].
It is also unclear if consent is required to gather evidence
that will be admissible in court. Evidence gathering is done
discreetly without the perpetrator’s knowledge. For the evi-
dence to be admissible in court, it is unclear to a victim if they
require the perpetrator’s consent to gather such evidence [78].
For instance, regarding sexualabuse_evidence it is often un-
clear if the victim needs consent from the perpetrator to record
the incident since both parties were involved in the act [58].
After the gathering of evidence: Victims can be revic-
timized. Some perpetrators have recorded themselves raping
their victims and uploaded the content online. This digital
content can serve as sexualassualt_evidence and help victims
get justice. However, the knowledge that such content exists,
and could be duplicated and replayed multiple times, can be
very traumatic for victims [96], [102], [126], [136]. Such
evidence serves “as a constant reminder of the abuse and
suffering, perpetuating humiliation” [80]. One such incident
is the tragic case of 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons. Multiple
perpetrators sexually abused Parsons when she was 15 years
old. During the incident, a photo was taken that was then
circulated on social media. Even though the picture acted as
evidence of the crime, it also resulted in cyberbullying and
psychological revictimization, and eventually led to Parsons
committing suicide [137].
Another challenge is that preparatoryactivities_evidence can
be ambiguous. Occasionally collected [86], this category of
evidence can include the accumulation of activities illustrating
that the perpetrator intended to abuse the victim sexually at a
later time. However, such evidence can be ambiguous, difﬁcult
to collect, and difﬁcult to determine if it proves a person’s
plans to commit sexual abuse [51], [79]. It is therefore easy
to discard such evidence [78]. For instance, “victims would
attempt to seek support by reporting the technology-facilitated
abuse to the police or discuss it with a trusted contact, only
to be told that the devices may be malfunctioning or that the
victim does not know how to use them correctly. [Stakehold-
ers] also demonstrated concern over the ‘believability’ of such
cases, wondering whether they themselves would ﬁnd accounts
of smart homes being used for abuse credible” [74]. Many
victims have had to endure technology-facilitated abuse from
perpetrators until it reaches a measureable extent before the
justice system can intervene [77].
Stakeholders’ knowledge gaps also leave victims at risk.
Some law enforcement ofﬁcers and support workers lack
an adequate understanding of technology or its facilitation

Stakeholders’ knowledge
gaps in this area put victims at more risk by limiting the
number of victims that come to seek help [58], [90], [128].
Sometimes frontline police ofﬁcers (who should be victims’
ﬁrst point of contact), support workers, and judges do not
understand the technology-facilitated abuse that victims are
reporting or the extent of the harm that technology can cause
if misused [128], [136], or they have insufﬁcient knowledge
of technology-related abuse to help victims [79]. Further,
the rapid rate at which technology is evolving widens this
knowledge gap [155]. Stakeholders identiﬁed the challenge of
keeping up with technology development as the most difﬁ-
cult part of collating and using evidence [155]. Even before
interacting with the new technologies, stakeholders believed
new technologies were complex to use [43]. Stakeholders also
admitted to not knowing the right questions to ask victims
about technology-facilitated abuse because of the knowledge
gap [79].
There are misconceptions about what technology can or
cannot do, limiting the believability of evidence. Stakeholders
have no clarity on the limitations or capabilities of a par-
ticular technological tool, meaning they can overestimate or
underestimate what technology can do. For instance, some
stakeholders believe all technology shown in movies or on
TV is possible in real life, which may not be the case [77].
After gathering evidence, it is still hard to determine if
consent was given. The determination of consent is a crucial
part of the investigative process in courts [155]. While in some
cases digital evidence clearly shows the absence of consent, in
other cases it is hard to determine [144]. It is even harder to
determine if consent was given and revoked later [91], [138].
It is also difﬁcult to prove that a person committed sexual
abuse. Because of how malleable technology can be, it is hard
to determine if a person committed sexual abuse based on
digital evidence. For example, “there are signiﬁcant challenges
for police in proving who created, shared, or threatened
to share, an image: How do you prove that that particular
Facebook account is operated by the defendant?” [128].
B. Reporting and preventing abuse
Technological solutions can assist victims in two major
ways: giving them a platform to (i) report and (ii) prevent
sexual abuse. For the rest of the paper, we refer to technolog-
ical solutions as solutions when the context is clear.
Many types of solutions exist for victims, support workers,
and bystanders. As Cardoso et al. put
it, solutions range
from “jewelry that provides location information to family and
friends, ... [to] underwear that shocks potential rapists” [56].
Various solutions have been developed by industry and gov-
ernment
