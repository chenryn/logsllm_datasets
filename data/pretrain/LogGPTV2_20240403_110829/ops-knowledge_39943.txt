User: Provide an online mall application design solution based on microservice architecture.
Assistant: Online mall application design scheme: 1. The architecture design adopts the micro-service architecture, which splits the application into multiple independent services for deployment and maintenance. Each service can be independently expanded and adjusted to improve the reliability and elasticity of the application. - User management service: Responsible for user authority authentication, login, registration, information management, etc. - Commodity management service: Responsible for commodity classification, information display, inventory management, order settlement, etc. - Order management service: Responsible for order generation, payment, delivery, evaluation, etc. - Search service: responsible for the retrieval and sorting of commodity information. - Payment service: Responsible for the access and payment processing of various payment methods. - Logistics service: responsible for querying and updating order logistics information. 2. Technology selection - user management service: Spring Boot + Spring Security + MyBatis - commodity management service: Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA/Hibernate + Elasticsearch - order management service: Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA/Hibernate + RabbitMQ - search service : Spring Boot + Elasticsearch - Payment Service: Spring Boot + Alipay/WeChat Pay API - Logistics Service: Spring Boot + Express100 API 3. Data Storage - MySQL: storage of core business data such as user information, commodity information, order information, payment information, etc. - Redis: Storage of cached data such as product lists, categories, order status, etc. - Elasticsearch: full-text search and sorting of commodity information. - RabbitMQ: Delivery of asynchronous messages such as order generation and payment result notification. 4. The deployment architecture uses Kubernetes clusters for deployment and management, and has excellent support for high availability, automated deployment, and capacity expansion. 5. Security - HTTPS: Use HTTPS encryption protocol to protect user privacy and security. - Spring Security: user authentication and rights management. - Firewall: restrict illegal access, avoid malicious attacks and data leakage. - DDos protection: guarantee the stability and availability of application services. The above is a simple online mall application design scheme based on microservice architecture, which can be adjusted and optimized according to the actual situation.
