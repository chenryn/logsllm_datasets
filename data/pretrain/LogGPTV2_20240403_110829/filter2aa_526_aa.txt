information visualization is the use of 
interactive, sensory representations, 
typically visual, of abstract data to 
reinforce cognition.

• Helps find patterns
• Helps reduce search 
space
• Aids efficient monitoring
• Enables interaction   
(what if)
• Help prevent 
overwhelming the user
Why InfoVis?
So What?
• Go Beyond the Algorithm
• Help with detecting and understand some 
0day attacks
• Make CTF and Root Wars a Spectator Sport
• Help find insider threats
• Stealth might not be so stealthy
• Help visually fingerprint attacks/tools
What tasks do you need help with?

Intrusion Detection System Types
• Host-based intrusion-detection is the art of detecting 
malicious activity within a single computer by using
– host log information
– system activity
– virus scanners
• A Network intrusion detection system is a system that 
tries to detect malicious activity such as denial of service 
attacks, port-scans or other attempts to hack into computers 
by reading all the incoming packets and trying to find 
suspicious patterns.

Linux 2.2 TCP/IP sequence numbers are not as good as they might be, but are certainly adequate, and attack feasibility is very low.

High Speed Data 
Flow Visualization
Therminator technology 
watches the data stream 
and illustrates categories 
of data as colored bars 
that are proportional in 
height to the quantity of 
data at a given time. The 
process is repeated to 
form a stacked bar graph 
that moves across a 
computer screen to show 
current and past data 
traffic composition.
