User: Does any standard "comes with batteries" method exist to clear the terminal screen from a Python script, or do I have to go curses (the libraries, not the words)?
Assistant: Why hasn't anyone talked about just simply doing Ctrl+L in Windows or  Cmd+L in Mac.
Surely the  simplest way of clearing screen.
