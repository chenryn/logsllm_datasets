User: I am trying to use Pyinstaller to create a python 2.7 executable in windows 7. I followed all the suggestions in the manual (using pip-win and Pywin32) but once the file has been created I cannot open the application and I get the error message: 
"Windows cannot access the specified the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."
Does anyone have any idea why this might be happening and what I can do to prevent it? Sorry if this question is a bit vague, I will try and provide more details if I can. 
Thanks in advance
Assistant: I had the same problem since today (the last days was working fine).
I figured out that the problem was when I create the .exe file with --icon, if you don't create the file with the --icon should work fine.
