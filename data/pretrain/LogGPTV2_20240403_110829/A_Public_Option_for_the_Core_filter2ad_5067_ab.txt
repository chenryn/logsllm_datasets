ation. Instead, our paper is far more general, considering a radical
alternative for the Internet’s infrastructure and an analysis of its im-
pact on the overall ecosystem of ISPs and CSPs. Instead of detailed
performance results, our contributions are more subtle and fall into
three categories:
Structure: Motivated by the four troubling trends described in Sec-
tion 2, we describe a proposal for (i) cleanly separating transit and
last-mile-delivery in the Internet’s infrastructure and (ii) structuring
the flow of payments. This aligns the revenue flow with the value
flow, which reduces economic distortions and allows growth and
innovation to occur where needed. This overall structure, which we
consider a new economic architecture for the Internet, is the most
important aspect of our design. The centerpiece of this new struc-
ture is the POC, a global edge-to-edge transit network run by an
international nonprofit.
Auction: To realize this POC, we propose an auction (in Section
3) that provides a strategy-proof mechanism for compensating BPs
for their leased lines. The strategy-proof nature allows BPs to focus
on evaluating their own costs, rather than analyzing the market to
determine their bids.
Analysis of Network Neutrality: Finally, in Section 4 we discuss
network neutrality, by which we mean the prohibition of termina-
tion fees, which we define in the next section. We present a novel
economic model of CSPs and LMPs, and show how not requiring
network neutrality would hurt social welfare (in the economic sense)
and future innovation (by favoring incumbents). While our general
conclusions are in line with some others in the literature [54], we
are not aware of a similar model that captures the relevant aspects of
network neutrality so cleanly.
1.4 Ethical Considerations
This work does not raise any ethical issues.
2 Why Change?
While the easy availability of wide-area bandwidth makes our
proposal possible, it does not justify the need for major change. Here
we first outline four troubling trends (similar to those cited in the
2005 FCC report [21]) that motivate our proposal, and then describe
how the POC helps deal with them.
2.1 Peering Policies Are Outdated
The BGP policy mechanism is transitive, in the sense that a do-
main’s policy choices (about which routes to import) are limited
to the options exported by its neighbors, which are in turn limited
to the choices presented to them by their neighbors. This works
well because typical BGP policies are expressed in terms of cus-
tomer/provider/peer relationships, which are themselves transitive
(i.e., the provider of my provider acts like my provider). Moreover,
these customer/provider/peer relationships are often determined by
the amount of traffic carried (i.e., two ISPs exchanging roughly
equal amounts of traffic can peer, while those sending more than
they receive typically have to pay the other party).
While transit carries data across the Internet, the real value of
the Internet is what happens at the end points where services and
content are produced and consumed. As coined in [19], a seminal
paper on this topic, we often refer to networks where services and
content originate as content networks, and to networks where they
are consumed as eyeball networks. Traffic flows primarily from
content to eyeball networks, but the value flows both ways: eyeballs
derive value from content and services, while content and service
providers (CSPs) derive value (in terms of direct and/or advertising
revenue) from eyeballs. This value chain does not fit BGP’s transitive
nature, nor is it based on the relative rates of traffic between domains
(as some traffic has far more value-per-bit than others).
This is not merely an academic concern. For instance, the mis-
match between value flow and current peering relationships has
resulted in several disputes involving Netflix traffic. In one, Netflix
contracted with Cogent for transit because of its low prices, but then
Comcast complained when Cogent tried to transfer that data to Com-
cast’s network. Comcast was seen as violating network neutrality,
when the more relevant dynamic was a failure of modern peering
policies and their transitive nature [18].
More generally, the problem is that ISPs often combine serving
eyeballs (where value is consumed) with providing transit (where
the costs are just per-bit) and offering their own content and ser-
vices (where value is created). Even though traffic between ISPs
can be binned into different categories, there is no way the simple
transitive nature of Internet peering could possibly capture the result-
ing economic interactions (which are not, on the whole, transitive).
Violating network neutrality is one way of getting around the transi-
tive nature of interconnection; we feel that our proposal is a more
constructive step forward.
In addition, there are two other trends that are further disrupting
traditional interconnection arrangements: IXPs and CDNs. IXPs
provide interconnection points where a wide variety of networks can
directly peer with each other. As described in [5], they are gaining
in popularity among smaller ISPs, while larger ones have mostly
avoided them. CDNs have been around for decades, but with video
dominating traffic CDNs have become more important than ever (we
discuss CDNs briefly in Section 3.2).
2.2 Network Neutrality at Risk
The technical Internet community has long embraced the no-
tion that the Internet should be application-neutral; that notion later
became known as network neutrality (a term coined in [57]). In
what follows, we use both of these terms – network neutrality and
application-neutrality – with the former having more of a legal
connotation than the latter. Wikipedia [56] defines network neutral-
ity as follows: “Net neutrality is the principle that Internet service
providers treat all data on the Internet equally, and not discriminate
or charge differently by user, content, website, platform, application,
type of attached equipment, or method of communication.” A similar
definition that explicitly mentions the topic of charging comes from
[28]: “Net neutrality usually means that broadband service providers
charge consumers only once for Internet access, do not favor one
content provider over another, and do not charge content providers
for sending information over broadband lines to end users.”

Y. Harchol, et al
Officials at several ISPs have made clear their opposition to this
last point about not charging content providers for traffic reaching
their customers. In 2005, Ed Whitacre (then CEO of SBC) said [43]
“Now what they (content providers) would like to do is use my pipes
[for] free, but I ain’t going to let them do that because we have spent
this capital and we have to have a return on it.” Similar statements
about charging content or application providers have been made
more recently by the CEOs of Telefonica, Vodafone, and Deutsche
Telekom [35, 45, 47].
The legal status of network neutrality has changed over time in
the United States. In 2005, the US’s FCC adopted network neutrality
principles and in 2015 the FCC issued the Open Internet Order that
gave them the right to enforce network neutrality. However, in 2018
these network neutrality regulations were repealed, although some
states have since instituted their own network neutrality regulations.
More globally, the European Union has strong network neutrality
regulations [4], but elsewhere regulations vary from country to coun-
try, and there is no uniform global standard.
There is a large academic economic literature on network neu-
trality, which we briefly review in Section 4. The literature comes
down on all sides of network neutrality: some explicitly in favor
(e.g., [23, 36]), some explicitly against (e.g., [20, 58]), and some
delivering a more mixed message of “it depends” (e.g., [17]). The
literature employs a set of simple models to make their case, and in
Section 4 we introduce another model that we think better captures
the relevant aspects of the situation. Our results indicate that without
network neutrality, incumbent LMPs and CSPs have a significant
competitive advantage, which would hinder innovation.
Given this result, we must answer the question of how such regu-
lations could be enforced in an infrastructure like the Internet that
transcends national boundaries. We return to this challenge later in
this section.
2.3 Competition In The ISP Market
We restrict our comments on this topic to the US market, because
the nature of ISP competition depends strongly on past and current
regulatory frameworks. Most of the developed world has far more
competition in the ISP market, largely due to loop unbundling, by
which we mean regulations requiring telecommunication operators
to allow other service providers to use (at a fair price) their last-
mile lines into homes. This means that new service providers can
enter the market without building their own last-mile infrastructure.
However, in the US ISP competition is very thin, with many areas
having only one or two viable high-bandwidth service providers.
According to figures for December 2017 [32] (also see [48]), while
over 95% of US census blocks have two or more providers supplying
at least 25mbps downloads (and at least 3mbps uploads), only 26%
of census blocks have one or more providers supplying at least
100mbps downloads (and at least 10mbps uploads), with only 5% of
census blocks having three or more such providers.
The high capital and operational costs of reaching individual
homes and businesses is one factor for why competition is so limited
for high-bandwidth network service. However, a contributing factor
is that such ISPs must either build their own core network (at signifi-
cant cost and management complexity) or contract with an ISP to
provide transit. In many cases (Cogent and Level3 are exceptions),
these transit ISPs are competing for the same last-mile market, and
can use their transit pricing to put new competitors at a disadvantage.
2.4 Vertical Integration
There are two forms of vertical integration, which we consider
separately.
2.4.1 CSPs building their own network Some of the leading
CSPs have built their own backbones (e.g., Google, Facebook, Ama-
zon, Akamai). Between CSPs that have their own backbone, and
those that host their service on one of the CSPs that have their own
backbone, it turns out that a very significant fraction of the Inter-
net’s traffic is immediately shunted into a private backbone after
leaving their home domain. For instance, the results in [8] show
that for traffic leaving GCE towards various BGP prefixes, weighted
by the volume of requests from those prefixes in their CDN trace,
roughly 66% of the requests went directly from one AS to another.
Consistent with this, we were confidentially told by an operator that
their estimate of the percentage of such direct-from-home-to-private-
backbone was roughly 70% [44]. Regardless of the exact number,
this trend is undeniable.
Geoff Huston comments on this trend in an article entitled “The
Death of Transit?” [31] (see also [9]) where he notes that most traffic
is first handled by CDN nodes at the edge, which then corral (accord-
ing to [31]) “each client into a service ‘cone’ defined by a collection
of local data centres.” Thus, there is still tremendous bandwidth
dedicated to moving bits on backbones, but much of the action has
left the public Internet and is now carried on private networks. This
runs the risk of creating several private Internet infrastructures that
essentially cater to particular sets of services, leaving the public
Internet to languish. This goes against the application-neutral spirit
of the Internet, and might (in the long run) slow innovation.
2.4.2
ISPs also providing content and/or services Various large
ISPs, such as Comcast and AT&T, are buying content providers [15].
This raises the risk of network neutrality violations, in that their
network infrastructure can favor their own services over others. Prior
work [37] has already shown that many cellular providers implement
policies favoring some content providers to the detriment of others.
If this trend is left unchecked, it could greatly impact the ability of
CSPs to reach customers in LMPs who have competing offerings.
2.5 Why the POC?
As we have described, the current Internet infrastructure has
an outdated mode of providing transit, based on transitive peering
relationships that focus on the flow of packets but ignore the flow of
value. This has caused many ISPs to contemplate charging so-called
termination fees, where remote services (such as Netflix or Google)
are charged for packets that flow into a last-mile’s provider network.
This would allow the ISPs to capture some of the value of these
services, and they feel entitled because they are providing the access
to customers.
While such termination fees are not yet implemented, there is
no federal prohibition from doing so in the US (and in many other
countries). Further, the growing trend of large ISPs entering the con-
tent and service market increases the temptation to violate network
neutrality by favoring their own services over competing ones.
A Public Option for the Core
SIGCOMM ’20, August 10–14, 2020, Virtual Event, NY, USA
All of this is occurring in a landscape where there is little com-
petition among ISPs (at least in the US), and traffic is increasingly
funneled into private networks for transit. Thus, it seems a good time
to step back and see if there is a way to reorganize the Internet’s
infrastructure to counter these trends.
Most fundamentally, our proposal is intended to provide an eco-
nomic architecture that makes sense for the Internet. It scraps the
traditional interconnection agreements and instead has all transit
handled by the POC, with all LMPs (and CSPs) directly attached to
the POC paying for transit based on traffic sent and received. CSPs
and LMPs collect revenue directly from their customers. To enforce
network neutrality, the POC’s terms-of-service require that all at-
tached LMPs peer freely with all others, with no termination fees
and no differential service given to packets based on their source.
The POC would thus prohibit an LMP from giving their own
content better service on their own network; LMPs would be free
to acquire or develop such services as a business investment, but
they would not be able to provide them with an unfair advantage.
Similarly, the POC would not prevent large CSPs from building their
own private backbones, but the POC would ensure that all CSPs,
not just large ones, could have access to a high-performance transit
service.
All of this helps improve competition in both the LMP and CSP
markets: new entrants are not unfairly burdened by termination fees,
and all LMPs and CSPs have access to high-performance transit that
is not competing with them.
Note that loop unbundling, while definitely desirable, solves a
different set of problems than the POC. Loop unbundling allows
many LMPs to share the same last-mile infrastructure, making it easy
for new entrants to arise, but unless they build their own network core
these new entrants must contract with one or more transit carriers
who might be competing with them. Moreover, as we observe in
Section 4, the lack of network neutrality allows incumbent LMPs
to charge higher termination fees than new entrants, thereby giving
them an unfair advantage. Thus, the POC and loop unbundling are
highly complementary solutions; one eases the construction of last-
mile infrastructure, and the other ensures that new entrants need
not build their own core or contract with potentially competing
providers for transit and will not face unfair competition (via higher
termination fees) from incumbent LMPs.
2.6
Is this really new?
There are already a variety of nonprofit and governmental net-
works in operation that provide transit. For instance, in Australia,
NBN is a national governmental monopoly for wholesale Internet
and telephony transit [38]. NBN owns its links and leases them us-
ing a uniform pricing mechanism regardless of where the service is
delivered, so rural areas are cross-subsidized by metropolitan areas
