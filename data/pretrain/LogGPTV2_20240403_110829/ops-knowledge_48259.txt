User: Create a pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy applications to Azure Kubernetes Service.
Assistant: Here are the steps on how to create a pipeline using Azure DevOps to deploy applications to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): 1. Create a new Azure DevOps project or open an existing one. 2. Click Pipelines in the navigation bar at the top of the project page, and then click New Pipeline. 3. Select Classic Editor to use the classic pipeline editor. In the Build Pipeline section, select a code source and set up a trigger to automatically trigger the pipeline. 4. Next, you need to add a few tasks to set up the deployment to AKS environment. 5. Click Add Task in the Tasks section. Search for "Azure CLI" and select it, then click Add to add a task. 6. Select the Activate option to log in to the Azure CLI. Then, use the following command to install the required AKS CLI extension: az aks install-cli 7. Return to the new task after completion, and select "shell script" in the next step. Add the following command in the script section to connect to your AKS cluster. az aks get-credentials --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <aks-name> 8. Next, you need to define your Kubernetes manifest yaml file (you can use www.k8s.yml.com to get example). Add a task under the new task, titled "File Copy", the source folder is empty, and the copy to the target folder is $(build.artifactstagingdirectory). 9. Next, pass this manifest to the Azure Publishing Service. Under the task section click "Add Task", search for Azure CAT etc. (mainly some tasks for Publish vs), select Azure Kubernetes Service Deployment (AKS Publish Task for short) this task will read the manifest from the manifest yaml file in Azure DevOps , and publish it to your AKS cluster. 10. Run the pipeline and verify the deployment. These are the basic steps to create and execute an Azure DevOps pipeline to deploy an application to AKS, hope it helps.
