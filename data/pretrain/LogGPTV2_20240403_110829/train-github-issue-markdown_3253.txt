##### SUMMARY
First of all, sorry, this is an incomplete issue report. I haven't yet
properly isolated the problem, but I see that you're approaching a v2.2.1
release and I think it's a release blocker. I'll work on completing the issue
soon.
jinjia2 recently released its v2.9, but upgrading to jinja2 2.9 causes
problems in my provisioning that is fixed by reverting to jinja2 2.8.x
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
None yet, coming soon.
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
No error
##### ACTUAL RESULTS
