### Summary
Firstly, I apologize for the incomplete issue report. I have not yet fully isolated the problem, but given that you are approaching the v2.2.1 release, I believe this is a potential release blocker. I will work on providing a more detailed report soon.

The recent release of Jinja2 v2.9 has caused issues in my provisioning process. Reverting to Jinja2 v2.8.x resolves these problems.

### Steps to Reproduce
- Not available at this time; details will be provided soon.

### Expected Results
- No errors should occur during the task execution.

### Actual Results
- An exception occurred during task execution. The full traceback can be viewed with the `-vvv` option.
- Error message: `KeyError: 'undefined variable: 0'`
- Task failed on the host `sfl-web-django-ci` with the following output:
  ```
  fatal: [sfl-web-django-ci]: FAILED! => {"failed": true, "msg": "Unexpected failure during module execution.", "stdout": ""}
  ```
