User: You need to copy a set of NGINX configuration files from one server to several other servers. Please provide an automated deployment solution based on Ansible.
Assistant: Ansible's copy module can be used to copy NGINX configuration files to the same location on other servers. The following are the implementation steps: 1. Create a folder named nginx_config on the Ansible host, and place the NGINX configuration file in this folder. 2. Create a file named inventory and specify the server IP address or host name, such as: [servers] server1 ansible_host=192.168.0.1 server2 ansible_host=192.168.0.2 server3 ansible_host=192.168.0.3 3. Write a file named deploy.yml Ansible Playbook file to copy the NGINX configuration file to the remote server. The content of the Playbook file is as follows: --- - name: Deploy NGINX config file hosts: servers become: true tasks: - name: Copy NGINX config file copy: src=/path/to/nginx_config/nginx.conf dest=/etc/ nginx/nginx.conf 4. Execute the following command to deploy the NGINX configuration file: ansible-playbook -i inventory deploy.yml The above command will run the Playbook in the deploy.yml file and copy the NGINX configuration file to all defined in the inventory file same location on the server. 5. Verify the deployment of the NGINX configuration file. Use SSH to connect to any target server, and check whether the deployment is successful through commands. $ sudo cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf If the NGINX configuration file was successfully deployed, you should see what you copied in the copy operation.
