Would anyone be interested in a PR for bundling ES6 modules into single IFFE-
scoped files? (a la rollup.js) This would allow bundling for those who don't
wish to rely on AMD/System, and remove at least one build step in many
scenarios.
(Apologies if duplicate. Search/FAQ didn't come up with anything. If
additional details are desired, I can put those together as well)
Example below (modified from rollupjs's website):
    //main.ts (source)
    import * as x from './maths';
    var z : number = 3;
    console.log( x.cube( 5 ) + z ); 
    //maths.ts (source)
    //variable namespacing could be accomplished by appending, as seen here, or via internal IFFEs
    var z : number = 0;
    export function square ( x : number ): number {
        return x * x + z;
    }
    //unreferenced functions intelligently culled
    export function cube ( x : number ): number {
        return x * x * x + z;
    }
    //main.js (outFile)
    (function () {
        'use strict';
        //variable namespacing could be accomplished by appending, as seen here, or via internal IFFEs
        var z$1 = 0;
        //unreferenced functions intelligently culled
        function cube ( x ) {
            return x * x * x + z$1;
        }
        var z = 3;
        console.log( cube( 5 ) + z );
    }());
