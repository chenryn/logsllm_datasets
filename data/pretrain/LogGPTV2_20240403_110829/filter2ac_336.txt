### Title: Two Bugs, One PoC: Rooting Pixel 6 from Android 12 to Android 13

**Abstract:**

The Google Pixel 6 is the first smartphone to feature the new Tensor chip, entirely designed and developed by Google. This device ships with Linux kernel version 5.10, introducing several new changes and challenges for rooting. Despite these changes, the attack surfaces remain relatively similar.

In this presentation, I will first review a well-known, publicly exploited vulnerability and provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a Proof of Concept (PoC) for it. Even without advanced variable analysis, you can identify a similar issue and develop a new PoC in under 10 minutes. Interestingly, the same PoC can also trigger another Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability, albeit without causing a kernel panic.

Before delving into the exploitation techniques, I will briefly discuss the changes and challenges associated with rooting Android 12 and Android 13 devices. I will then detail the methods to exploit both vulnerabilities, including how to bypass common mitigations such as Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR), User Access Only (UAO), and Page Attribute Table (PAN). The goal is to achieve root access on the Pixel 6, transitioning from Android 12 to Android 13, with a 100% success rate.

During the presentation, I will demonstrate the exploit in action, providing a live demo of rooting the Pixel 6. To date, the specific vulnerabilities and the detailed exploitation techniques have not been thoroughly covered in any previous talks.

**Key Points:**
- **Device and Kernel Overview:** Introduction to the Google Pixel 6 and its Linux kernel 5.10.
- **Vulnerability Review:** Detailed examination of a known, publicly exploited vulnerability.
- **PoC Creation:** Step-by-step guide to creating a PoC, including a quick method to find and exploit a similar issue.
- **Dual Exploit:** Explanation of how the same PoC triggers an additional UAF vulnerability.
- **Rooting Challenges:** Discussion on the changes and challenges in rooting Android 12 and Android 13 devices.
- **Exploitation Techniques:** Methods to exploit the vulnerabilities, bypass mitigations, and achieve root access.
- **Live Demo:** A demonstration of the exploit, showcasing the rooting process.

This talk aims to provide a comprehensive and practical understanding of the vulnerabilities and their exploitation, making it a valuable resource for security researchers and enthusiasts.
