The challenge available at <http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-use-the-twitch.tv-json-api> contains an issue that needs to be addressed. Here is a detailed description of how to reproduce the problem, along with the necessary correction.

### Issue Description
In **Step #13** of the challenge, the provided guidance states: "Remember to use RSAP if you get stuck. Try using jQuery's `$.getJSON()` to consume APIs." However, the link associated with this step incorrectly directs to <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/>. The correct link should point to <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/>.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to the challenge page at <http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-use-the-twitch.tv-json-api>.
2. Scroll down to **Step #13**.
3. Click on the link provided in the step.
4. Observe that the link redirects to <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/> instead of <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/>.

### Suggested Correction
- **Current Link:** <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/>
- **Correct Link:** <http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/>

### Additional Notes
It is unclear whether the misdirection to `$.each()` is intentional as a form of challenge for the student. If it is not, the link should be corrected to ensure that students are directed to the appropriate documentation for `$.getJSON()`.

### Screenshots (if possible)
If you can provide screenshots, they would further clarify the issue:
- A screenshot of **Step #13** showing the incorrect link.
- A screenshot of the page that the incorrect link leads to.
- A screenshot of the correct `$.getJSON()` documentation page.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
