    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    Compiling exp/locale/collate consumes more than 200mb on 32bit platforms like arm (more
    than 300 mb on amd64). The is most likely caused by the 50k line tables.go, and its ~
    300k values.
    Can anything be done to reduce the amount of memory consumed when compiling this package?
