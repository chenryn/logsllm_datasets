### Account Verification and Advertiser Categorization on Facebook

#### A. Account Verification
On Facebook, an account can become an advertiser without undergoing any verification process. This openness allows both popular, well-known advertisers and niche ones to participate. Additionally, Facebook offers a verification mechanism where accounts can acquire a verified badge. While verified or popular advertisers are not guaranteed to be trustworthy, their higher exposure to public scrutiny suggests a potential for greater trustworthiness.

1. **Popularity:**
   - We measure the popularity of advertisers by the number of Likes on their Facebook Pages.
   - Advertisers are categorized into three groups:
     1. **Niche:** 1,000 Likes or fewer.
     2. **Ordinary:** Between 1,000 and 100,000 Likes.
     3. **Popular:** Over 100,000 Likes.
   - In our dataset, niche advertisers make up 16% (15% in DATA-BRAZIL), ordinary advertisers 52% (61% in DATA-BRAZIL), and popular advertisers 32% (24% in DATA-BRAZIL).
   - Popular advertisers place a larger number of ads: 63% of all unique ads come from popular advertisers, 32% from ordinary, and 5% from niche (61%, 35%, and 4% respectively in DATA-BRAZIL).

2. **Verification:**
   - There are two types of verification badges: blue and gray.
   - **Blue Badge:** For profiles of public interest figures, requiring official government-issued photo identification.
   - **Gray Badge:** For businesses, requiring a publicly listed phone number or associated documents like a phone bill.
   - Table V shows the fraction of verified advertisers across the categories. Niche advertisers are less frequently verified (0.2% blue, 6.4% gray) compared to ordinary (10.3% blue, 12.6% gray) and popular advertisers (66.9% blue, 6.1% gray).
   - Overall, 26.6% of advertisers have a blue badge and 9.6% have a gray one. Notably, 38.9% of ads come from unverified advertisers.

#### B. Advertiser Categories
When creating a Facebook Page, advertisers can self-report one or more categories corresponding to their business. They can choose from a predefined list of 1,543 categories (organized hierarchically with a maximum depth of 6) or input a free-text category.

- Our dataset includes 943 unique categories (968 in DATA-BRAZIL). Table IV lists the 20 most common categories, which appear in 51.4% of advertisers.
- Many advertisers report general categories like "Website," "Company," or "Product/Service," while others report more specific categories such as "Evangelical Church," "Aquarium," or "Opera House."

To analyze the sectors from which advertisers originate, we map the categories in our dataset to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomy, a de-facto standard in advertising. The IAB taxonomy consists of 29 Tier-1 categories. For categories like "Public Figure," "Community Organization," and "Non-Business Places," we created new categories. For advertisers with only coarse-grained categories, we did not assign an IAB category. We successfully mapped 83% of advertisers (86.1% in DATA-BRAZIL) to an IAB category.

- Tables VI and VII present the top 10 IAB categories and the respective percentages of advertisers and ads in our datasets. Sensitive categories include News and Politics, Education, Medical Health, Legal, Religion and Spirituality, and Business and Finance.
- These tables show that 7 out of the top 10 IAB categories are the same in both datasets. A significant number of advertisers and ads come from potentially sensitive categories such as News and Politics (8.6%) and Education.
- The four sensitive categories (Business and Finance, Medical Health, Legal, and Religion and Spirituality) each constitute a minority of ads but add up to 3-4% of the ads, representing up to 3 ads per week for the average user.

#### C. Key Takeaways
The ecosystem of advertisers on Facebook is broad and complex, including both popular, verified, and more likely trustworthy advertisers, as well as many niche and unverified ones. A non-negligible fraction of advertisers belong to potentially sensitive categories such as politics, finance, health, legal, and religion (adding up to ~10%). This highlights the importance of investigating how such advertisers use the system, given the difficulty in assessing the quality and trustworthiness of their ads.

### D. Targeting Strategies
For the different types of advertisers identified, we analyze how they target users, which users they target, and how they customize their ads.

#### A. Analysis of Targeting Strategies
1. **Breakdown of Targeting Types:**
   - Advertisers on Facebook can choose from various targeting methods. We analyzed ad explanations provided by Facebook using the "Why am I seeing this?" feature.
   - The individual targeting mechanisms are grouped into several broad types:
     - **Age/Gender/Location:** Based on age, gender, and location.
     - **Attribute-based:** Based on precise lists of targeting attributes, split into subcategories: Behaviors, Demographics and Interests, Data Brokers, and Profile Data.
     - **PII-based:** Using Custom Audiences with lists of PII.
     - **Retargeting:** Targeting users who have previously interacted with the business.
     - **Lookalike Audiences:** Letting Facebook choose the audience based on past results.
     - **Location-based:** Targeting users at or near specific GPS locations.
     - **Social Neighborhood:** Targeting users whose friends liked the Facebook page.

Figures 2a and 2b present a timeline of daily frequency of each targeting type with respect to the total number of ads collected each day. The proportion of each targeting type is fairly consistent over time and across datasets.

- **Table VIII** shows the overall frequency of each targeting type, the fraction of advertisers using these types, and the fraction of users targeted with these types.
- **Impact of Biases and Limitations:**
  - The precedence of targeting types (as per prior work) is: Demographics & Age/Gender/Location > Interests > PII-based > Behaviors.
  - Multi-type targeting can lead to underestimation of some types, but the consistent proportions over time and across datasets suggest minimal bias.

In summary, the most prevalent targeting types are Age/Gender/Location (19% of ads) and Attribute-based (47% of ads, with Interests at 39%). A substantial fraction (17%) of ads use Lookalike audiences, a newer and potentially problematic strategy due to its opaque algorithm and vulnerability to deceptive practices.
