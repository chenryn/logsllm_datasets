account can be an advertiser without going through any
veriﬁcation process. This means that the platform is open
to both popular and well-known advertisers as well as niche
ones. Additionally, Facebook offers a veriﬁcation mechanism
where anyone who wishes can acquire a veriﬁed badge [21].
While popular or veriﬁed advertisers are not guaranteed to be
trustworthy, we consider the fact that they are more exposed to
public scrutiny than the rest as an indication of their potential
trustworthiness.
1) Popularity: We consider the number of Likes that ad-
vertisers have received on their Facebook Pages as a measure
of their popularity; we bin advertisers in three different cate-
gories: (1) niche, with 1K Likes or less, (2) ordinary, with
between 1K and 100K Likes, and (3) popular, with over
100K Likes.
Niche advertisers constitute 16% of the Facebook adver-
tisers in our dataset, ordinary 52%, and popular 32% (15%;
61%; 24% for DATA-BRAZIL). While there are more ordinary
advertisers than popular in both data sets, popular advertisers
place a larger number of ads: 63% of all unique ads we
collected come from popular, 32% from ordinary and 5% from
niche advertisers (61%; 35%; 4% for DATA-BRAZIL).
2) Veriﬁcation: There exists two types of veriﬁcation
badges: one blue and one gray. Blue badges are for proﬁles
of public interest ﬁgures, and require a copy of an ofﬁcial
government-issued photo identiﬁcation such as a passport.
Gray badges are for businesses and require a publicly listed
phone number, or a document like phone bill that is associated
with the business.
Table V shows the fraction of veriﬁed advertisers for
niche, ordinary and popular advertisers. In both datasets niche
advertisers tend to be less frequently veriﬁed (0.2% for blue
and 6.4% for gray veriﬁcation) compared to ordinary (10.3%
and 12.6%) and popular advertisers (66.9% and 6.1%). In total,
only 26.6% of advertisers have a blue badge and 9.6% a gray
one; our data shows that a large fraction (38.9%) of ads come
from advertisers that are not veriﬁed.
B. Advertisers’ categories
When advertisers on Facebook create a Page, they can self-
report one or more categories that correspond to their business.
Advertisers can either choose from a predeﬁned list of 1,543
different categories (organized in a hierarchical tree with a
maximum depth of 6) or input a free-text category.
We observe 943 unique categories in our dataset (968 in
DATA-BRAZIL). Table IV presents the 20 most common cate-
gories among advertisers (they appear in 51.4% of advertisers
in our dataset).
Many advertisers only report a general category such
as Website, Company, or Product/Service which are not
particularly informative about the sector in which the advertiser
works, while others report very ﬁne-grained categories such
as Evangelical Church, or Aquarium, or Opera House.
To be able to analyze which sectors advertisers come from
and to have more homogeneous categories for all, we map
advertisers6 in our dataset
to categories in the Interactive
Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomy [15]. This taxonomy
provides categories for advertising purposes and is a de-facto
standard in advertising. It is composed of 29 Tier-1 categories
such as News and Politics or Education. For the Facebook
categories Public Figure, Community Organization, Non-
Business Places there is no suitable existing IAB category,
so we create a new category. Also, since IAB does not have
a Tier-1 categories for all businesses we observe, we created
Legal, Other Media, and Entertainment categories as well.
For advertisers with only coarse-grained categories such as

Company or Website we do not assign to them any IAB
category. In total we manage to map 83% advertisers to a IAB
category (86.1% for DATA-BRAZIL).
Advertisers from some categories have the potential to
inﬂuence users’ decisions on important personal and societal
issues. For example, political advertisers could inﬂuence how
users vote, and medical advertisers could affect an individual’s
decisions about treatment. We consider News and Politics,
Education, Medical Health, Legal, Religion and Spiritual-
ity, and Business and Finance categories as sensitive. While
we do not claim that advertisers from sensitive domains should
not send ads, we aim to pay speciﬁc attention in our analysis
to such categories.
Tables VI and VII present the top 10 IAB categories and
the respective percentage of advertisers and ads that appear in
our datasets. The tables also show (in the bottom) sensitive
categories such as Legal that are not part of the top 10. The
tables show that 7 out of the top 10 IAB categories are the
same in the two datasets. Besides, there is a signiﬁcant number
of advertisers and ads that come from potentially sensitive
categories such as News and Politics (8.6%) or Education.
Finally, the four sensitive categories Business and Finance,
Medical Health, Legal, and Religion and Spirituality each
constitute a minority of ads but add up to 3-4% of the ads,
which (given that each user receives a median of 11.1 ads per
day) still represents up to 3 ads per week.
C. Takeaways
The ecosystem of advertisers in Facebook is broad and
complex. There exists advertisers who are popular, veriﬁed,
and more likely to be trustworthy. On the other side, there
exist many niche and unveriﬁed advertisers for which it is
difﬁcult to estimate the trustworthiness without manual effort.
We also see that a non-negligible fraction of advertisers are
part of potentially sensitive categories such as politics, ﬁnance,
health, legal and religion (adding up to ∼10%). Taken together,
our analysis points to the fact that users receive ads from
advertisers that might concern sensitive information and whose
quality is difﬁcult to assess, making it even more important to
investigate how such advertisers are using the system.
V. HOW ARE THE ADVERTISERS TARGETING USERS?
For the different types of advertisers identiﬁed in Section
IV, we analyze (1) how they target users; (2) which users they
target; and (3) how they customize their ads.
A. Analysis of targeting strategies
1) Breakdown of targeting types: Advertisers on Facebook
can choose from a wide range of ways to reach users – see
Section II for more details. To analyze the different ways
advertisers reach people, we mine the ad explanations provided
by Facebook using the “Why am I seeing this?” feature [22].
Facebook ad explanations, despite their limitations, reveal part
of the advertisers’ targeting (see Section III-B); using the
results of prior work [22], we can draw useful conclusions.
By looking at
the patterns of ad explanations as well
as information in the Facebook Advertising Interface, we
have group the individual targeting mechanisms discussed in
Section II into several broad targeting types:
Age/Gender/Location – when advertisers target users based on
their age, gender, and location.
Attribute-based – when advertisers target users that satisfy a
precise list of targeting attributes. We split this in 5 subcate-
gories based on the source of data: Behaviors, Demographics
and Interests, which corresponds to attributes inferred by
Facebook from the user’s activities on the platform; Data bro-
kers [20], which corresponds to targeting based on attributes
inferred by external data brokers and not by Facebook7; and
Proﬁle data, which corresponds to information users provided
in their Facebook proﬁles such as marital status, employer, or
university attended.
PII-based – when advertisers target
their ads via Custom
Audiences that consist of lists of PII including emails or postal
addresses.
Retargeting – when advertisers target users who already inter-
acted with their business such as users that visited their page,
or used their mobile app.
7The data brokers that have partnered with Facebook in Europe, US, and
Brazil are Acxiom [2], Epsilon [6], Experian [7] and Oracle Data Cloud [18]

Lookalike audiences – when advertisers let Facebook choose
their audience based on past results and the characteristics of
previous audiences.
Location-based – when advertisers target users who were at
or passed by a precise GPS location.
Social neighborhood – when advertisers target users whose
friends liked their Facebook page.
Figures 2a and 2b present a timeline of daily frequency
of each targeting type with respect to the total number of
ads we collected each day (accompanied by the respective
daily number of active users). In general, the proportion of
each targeting type does not change substancially over time or
over dataset and is fairly consistent across our two data sets.8
Table VIII shows the overall frequency of each targeting type
with regard to the number of ads that have been targeted and
fraction of advertisers that have used these targeting types, as
well as the fraction of users that have been targeted with these
types for both datasets combined.
8The large increase for Attribute-based around December and January
2018 can be attributed to a possible bug from Facebook, where many ex-
planations from different advertisers showed the same demographic attribute,
namely Member of a Family-based household.

Impact of biases and limitations in the dataset: In the
ﬁfth column of Table VIII we show the precedence of each
targeting types according to prior work [22]. In case of multi-
type/multi-attribute targeting (e.g., advertisers that use both
PII-based and attribute-based targeting at
the same time),
Facebook only shows one reason in the corresponding ex-
planations (see Section III). The way Facebook selects the
reason shown impacts the frequencies reported in the table.
According to [22] the multi-type targeting precedence is:
Demographics & Age/Gender/Location > Interests > PII-
based > Behaviors. All targeting types with a precedence other
than 1 are therefore possibly underestimated. We do not know
how often advertisers are using multi-type targeting, so we
cannot estimate the degree of underestimation.
We acknowledge that some of the biases of our population
(see Section III-B) might affect the proportions, especially for
some types like Lookalike audiences and Retargeting which
might depend heavily on the activity of a user. However, the
fact that there are no large ﬂuctuations, and in general the
proportion of each type does not change signiﬁcantly over time
or across datasets gives us conﬁdence that the numbers we see
in this section are not overly biased by the population in our
datasets.
Looking at more detail at Table VIII we can observe that:
(1) Age/Gender/Location (19% of ads) and Attribute-based
(47% of ads, with Interests taking the biggest share at 39%)
are the most prevalent targeting types. These targeting types
are the two most traditional ways of targeting users online.
(2) A substancial fraction (17%) of ads are targeted us-
ing Lookalike audiences. This is a newer targeting strategy
employed by social media advertising platforms that allows
advertisers to ask Facebook to choose who to send the ad to
based on previous ad campaigns [1]. This targeting mecha-
nism is problematic because the algorithm behind Lookalike
audiences is unknown to the public and users have no way
of knowing why they received such an ad. On top of this, it
has been shown that Lookalike audiences are vulnerable to
deceptive advertisers that can use the mechanism to increase
the discrimination in their targeting [38].
