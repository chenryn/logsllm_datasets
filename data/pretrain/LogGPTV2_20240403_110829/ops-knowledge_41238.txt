User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题pam_unix(sshd:auth): auth could not identify password for [admin] - sshd[6968]? Why is the following log produced?

pam_unix(sshd:auth): auth could not identify password for [admin] - sshd[6968] 


Is it because of a timeout, or is there some other reason?

Assistant: One of the pam modules have made the password null and it is passed to the pam_unix. Once I fixed it, it started working fine. Thanks.
