User: On Windows if i use MKS toolkit shell, os.getcwd() function returns value in lower case. However on using windows cmd, it returned exact path.
Is it possible in Python by any means for os.getcwd() to return the exact path (without converting to lower case on Windows)?
Assistant: Before starting Python and using os.getcwd(), in your console you probably used "cd c:\your_path". It matters if this 'c' is lower or upper.
