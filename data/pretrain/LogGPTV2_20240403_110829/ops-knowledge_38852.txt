User: How do I retrieve the temperature of my CPU using Python?  (Assuming I'm on Linux)
Assistant: If your Linux supports ACPI, reading pseudo-file /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THM0/temperature (the path may differ, I know it's /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/temperature in some systems) should do it.  But I don't think there's a way that works in every Linux system in the world, so you'll have to be more specific about exactly what Linux you have!-)
