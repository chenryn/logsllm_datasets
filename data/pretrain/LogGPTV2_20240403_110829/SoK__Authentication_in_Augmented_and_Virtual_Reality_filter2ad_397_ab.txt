Although AR and VR are emerging technologies—and
steadily gaining popularity—little work has tried to system-
atize the state-of-the-art of AR/VR authentication in research

and in practice. Early work [14], [68] focused on systematizing
the functionalities of AR/VR technologies. For example, Rabbi
et al. [68] looked into the diﬀerent sensor-based tracking
techniques in AR systems. Some recent work systematized
the security and privacy challenges with AR/VR systems. For
example, Roesner et al. [69] were the ﬁrst
to survey the
security and privacy threats on augmented reality platforms.
They note that a multi-application model, where AR systems
are heading, would raise several security and privacy concerns.
De Guzman et al. [25] provide a thorough survey of security
and privacy in mixed reality systems; they consider authen-
tication as a security property in mixed reality and mention
some novel authentication strategies. Shrestha et al. [72]
looked into the security and privacy of wearable computing
devices, outlining a threat model around how to use them
in oﬀensive and defensive expositions. They discuss several
authentication methods and evaluate these methods using the
framework proposed by Bonneau et al. [16], but they do so
in the context of wearables and focus mainly on the types
of mechanisms proposed in research. In contrast, our study
focuses speciﬁcally on AR and VR devices and evaluates the
properties of the proposed methods. Overall, general security
and privacy concerns of AR/VR technology are surveyed from
multiple angles, but one of the key components of security—
user authentication—has not been a focus of prior work.
Bonneau et al. [16] proposed an inﬂuential framework for
evaluating authentication mechanisms. This framework is de-
signed to compare authentication mechanisms for smartphones
and laptops in “the quest to replace passwords.” Although
the framework is quite generic and has been adapted for
special cases including mobile authentication [74], [43], AR
and VR devices have unique capabilities and limitations that
are potentially not captured by this generic framework. For
instance, many interactions with AR and VR require large,
visible gestures. If an authentication method requires these
gestures, users may not feel comfortable using it in public
places. Bonneau et al. do not capture this notion of accept-
ability [16]. Thus, we exercise due diligence and propose a
framework for evaluating authentication methods speciﬁcally
on AR and VR. We take a holistic approach, using feedback
from users and developers to create a framework that captures
the unique needs of authentication on AR and VR devices.
C. Threat Model
The goal of the adversary is to impersonate a user to unlock
the device or to log into an account. Based on authentication
for personal general-purpose computing devices, we consider
two adversaries for AR/VR: one without physical access to
the device, and the other with physical access.
Adversaries without physical access. Since we expect users
will use AR devices in public places,
the ﬁrst adversary
we consider is an external observer (E). This adversary,
also known as a shoulder-surﬁng adversary, can observe the
user’s interactions with the device during authentication. This
adversary is particularly important in an AR/VR context and
has been frequently considered by prior work, e.g., [57], [56],
[62], [71]. We also consider an internal observer (I) who can
monitor sensors on the device. For this threat, we assume the
user accidentally installs a malicious app (controlled by the
adversary) onto the device. Such a threat has been previously
considered for smartphones, and laptops/desktops (e.g., [28],
[39]), but for AR the threat is more pronounced since ap-
plications often have access to a myriad of available sensors
which can be used for authentication. Finally, we consider a
credential stuﬃng (S) adversary who has access to the user’s
stolen credential from another veriﬁer.
Adversaries with physical access. An adversary can steal
an AR/VR device and launch more sophisticated software-
and hardware-based attacks; we call this a computation-bound
adversary (C). A similar but distinct adversary is one who
already has access to the device, for example, in an intimate
partner violence (IPV) scenario, or in the case of a curious
colleague who wants to impersonate a user. We call this a
UI-bound adversary (U) following the prior work [29]; such
adversaries are UI-bound in the sense they have brief access to
the device and can only interact with it via the provided user
interface. The computation-bound and UI-bound adversaries
are also known as oﬄine and online guessing adversaries,
respectively, in password attack literature.
Attacks can be made more eﬀective by combining two
or more adversarial settings discussed above. One common
adversarial scenario, known as an imitation attack [71], in-
volves the following steps: (1) gaining additional information
about the user via external observation, followed by (2) a UI-
bound attack when the device is accessible. However, as we
will discuss in Section VI, some of the prior work does not
consider even a single adversarial setting.
We record the threat models considered by researchers in
prior works in Section VI. We begin our systematization by
developing a set of coveted properties for authentication meth-
ods on AR/VR based on users’ and developers’ experiences
with existing authentication methods.
III. Users’ and Developers’ Perspectives
Towards AR/VR Authentication
We surveyed users and developers about their experience
with current authentication methods used on AR/VR. For
users, we seek to understand their experiences, concerns,
and needs when using the existing authentication mechanisms
in oﬀ-the-shelf AR/VR devices; for developers, we explore
whether they have incorporated authentication components
into their AR/VR apps and how they chose those components.
We use insights from this study to inform an evaluation of
existing and proposed authentication methods for AR and VR
in Sections V and VI.
A. Surveying AR/VR Users and Developers
Our survey contained ﬁve sections: screening, developer
experiences, device usage, authentication experiences, and
demographics/follow-up. Appendix A contains the full survey.
Participants had to be over 18 and be familiar with AR or

VR devices, either as a user or as a developer (or both). We
determined participant familiarity using a 7-point scale which
ranged from “I have never used any [AR/VR] glasses” to “I
own [AR/VR] glasses and use them often.” If the participant
indicated that they had used AR glasses only a few times, or
had never used AR glasses, we did not consider them familiar
with AR for the purposes of the survey. We used the same
criteria for VR. If the participant was familiar with neither
AR nor VR, we terminated the survey.
Ethics. Our study was reviewed by our IRB and exempted
as a human subject research study with minimal risk. We did
not collect any personally identiﬁable information except for
email addresses, which we only used for sending payments.
Survey promotion. We piloted the survey to ensure partici-
pants could interpret the questions as we intended. Then, we
identiﬁed 24 online platforms where we would promote our
survey, including relevant Slack channels (e.g., HoloDevel-
opers), university email lists, Twitter, Facebook groups (e.g.,
Oculus VR Community), and several relevant Reddit threads
(e.g., r/hololens). We advertised the survey on each platform
once on November 2, 2020, then once more on November 16,
2020, if applicable. We incentivized potential respondents with
the chance to win a $50 gift card for every 25 participants. If a
participant’s responses were deemed incomplete (see below),
they were not eligible for compensation.
Data ﬁltering. We obtained 306 responses over the three
weeks. We then discarded any incomplete (64) and poor qual-
ity (103) responses. For example, eight participants had clearly
responded in relation to their experiences on smartphone AR,
which was explicitly mentioned as out of scope for our study.
One provided nonsense answers (e.g. “asdf”). Additionally,
94 appeared to be from a scam hive: they were submitted
within a short time frame, with very similar email addresses
and identical and/or nonsensical answers (e.g., “No one else
can use it”). We discarded all such suspicious or irrelevant
responses. After ﬁltering, 139 responses remained.
Data analysis. To analyze the quantitative data, we focused
on descriptive statistics only. For qualitative analysis, we
collected participants’ free-text answers in the survey and
performed thematic analysis [18]. There were 414 free-text
comments across the 139 participants. Three researchers in-
dividually coded the ﬁrst half of the free-text answers, then
compared and discussed the codes together. This produced a
codebook based on the agreement of the three researchers. One
researcher then coded the remaining responses following the
codebook and updated the codebook if new codes were found.
Our ﬁnal codebook contains 168 codes. We categorized the
codes using multiple iterations of axial coding, then articulated
twenty-one themes that emerged from the data. Fig. 1 presents
notable themes and associated codes.

contains a summary of participant demographics. We note
that a majority of our participants are male; this may be
partially explained by gender disparities in the adoption of AR
and VR [24], in the gaming community (gaming is the most
popular reason our participants use AR and VR) [23], and on
Reddit (where many participants were referred from) [15].
Developers’ authentication decisions. Among the partici-
pants are forty-nine AR or VR developers. Twenty-one regu-
larly develop for AR or VR, while the rest have developed for
AR or VR in the past. We found that few AR/VR develop-
ers (29%) have ever deployed any authentication methods in
their apps. There is a disparity between AR-only and VR-
only developers: of twelve AR-only developers, six (50%)
have deployed authentication, compared to just three out of
eighteen developers (17%) who developed for VR only.
Of the ﬁfteen developers who have deployed authentication
in their apps, they have most frequently chosen to use pass-
words (42%) or paired accounts (36%). Below, we summarize
the reasons for their authentication decisions. We acknowledge
that this sample size is quite small, and thus our results may
not reﬂect the decisions of most AR/VR developers.
Ease of implementation. Five developers cite ease of imple-
mentation as a reason that they chose to use passwords (3 par-
ticipants), paired accounts (3), and iris scan (1). For example,
D02 (gender: M, age range: 45-54) chose a paired account

because “Its [sic] built into the platform.” D40 (M,25-34)
chose a password because it was straightforward to implement.
Consistency across platforms and services impacts devel-
opers’ decisions as well. D36 (M,35-44) shares that he chose
a Google account because “It was the simplest and required
for other [G]oogle services we were using.” Moreover, some
developers emphasized the importance of integration with non-
AR/VR versions of apps. D04 (M,25-34) describes that his VR
app also has a desktop portal, and thus it made sense to use
a password for both versions of the app.
Usability of
the authentication mechanism. Five devel-
opers discuss how the usability of diﬀerent authentication
mechanisms—such as ease of use (3), eﬃciency (2), and
speed (2)—impacts their choices. For example, D40 (M,25-
34) mentions, “QR code was easy for the user (no input
needed).” D33 (M,45-54) also associates ease of use with iris
scan and paired accounts since they do not require the use
of the cumbersome virtual keyboard. Evidently, developers
consider usability when choosing authentication mechanisms.
Users’ exposure to authentication. Participants have experi-
ence with a variety of AR/VR devices (see details in Fig. 6 in
Appendix B). However, we found that participants’ exposure
to authentication mechanisms on AR/VR devices is fairly
limited: twenty-one AR users (54%) have used authentication
on AR devices, as have eighty VR users on VR devices (61%).
This ﬁnding matches feedback from the developers that there
are few authenticated apps on AR/VR devices. Other potential
reasons for this limited exposure are that participants may not
own the device and thus do not log in by themselves, or the
device is shared and authentication is disabled for convenience.
We asked users which authentication methods they have
used on AR and VR. Users have experience using passwords,
unlock patterns, iris scan, paired devices, and paired accounts.
By far, passwords are the most commonly used; passwords
have been used by 81% of users with authentication experience
on AR and 94% of users with authentication experience on
VR. See Fig. 7 in Appendix B for more details.
Perceived security and privacy. Twenty-eight participants
consider authentication on AR/VR to be just as secure as on
any other devices. For example, P013 (M,18-14) mentions
that passwords on VR are “No more or less secure than
any other devices in my opinion.” These users are mainly
concerned about preexisting vulnerabilities unrelated to the
AR/VR platform (e.g., that passwords can be cracked).
Shoulder surﬁng is the major AR/VR-speciﬁc concern
expressed in our survey. However, participants disagree on
whether AR and VR are more or less vulnerable to shoulder
surﬁng than other technologies. The seventeen users who
believe AR/VR are more vulnerable to shoulder surﬁng are
concerned about attacks on visible authentication actions (12)
and the VR screen being visible on a secondary display (5).
For example, P019 (F,25-34) explains her concerns about
visible actions: “I think it could be possible to ﬁnd out
passwords by observing users typing them via holographic
numpads, since the gestures are large and easy to see.”
