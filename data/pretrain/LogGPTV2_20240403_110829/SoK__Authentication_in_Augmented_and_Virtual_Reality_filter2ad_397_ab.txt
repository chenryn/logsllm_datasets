Although Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are emerging technologies steadily gaining popularity, there has been limited work to systematically analyze the state-of-the-art in AR/VR authentication both in research and practice. Early studies, such as those by Rabbi et al. [68], focused on systematizing the functionalities of AR/VR technologies, particularly sensor-based tracking techniques. More recent work, including Roesner et al. [69] and De Guzman et al. [25], has addressed the security and privacy challenges associated with AR/VR systems. Roesner et al. [69] were the first to survey security and privacy threats on augmented reality platforms, noting that a multi-application model for AR systems would raise several concerns. De Guzman et al. [25] provided a comprehensive survey of security and privacy in mixed reality systems, considering authentication as a key security property and mentioning some novel strategies.

Shrestha et al. [72] examined the security and privacy of wearable computing devices, outlining a threat model and discussing various authentication methods. They evaluated these methods using the framework proposed by Bonneau et al. [16], but their focus was primarily on wearables. In contrast, our study specifically addresses AR and VR devices, evaluating the properties of proposed authentication methods. While general security and privacy concerns of AR/VR technology have been surveyed from multiple angles, user authentication has not been a primary focus in prior work.

Bonneau et al. [16] proposed a widely influential framework for evaluating authentication mechanisms, designed to compare methods for smartphones and laptops. Although this framework is generic and has been adapted for special cases, including mobile authentication [74], [43], it may not fully capture the unique capabilities and limitations of AR and VR devices. For instance, many interactions with AR and VR require large, visible gestures, which users may find uncomfortable in public settings. Bonneau et al. [16] do not address this notion of acceptability. Therefore, we propose a tailored framework for evaluating authentication methods specific to AR and VR, incorporating feedback from users and developers to address the unique needs of these devices.

### Threat Model

The goal of an adversary is to impersonate a user to unlock the device or log into an account. Based on authentication for personal general-purpose computing devices, we consider two types of adversaries for AR/VR: one without physical access to the device and the other with physical access.

**Adversaries without physical access:**
- **External Observer (E):** This adversary, also known as a shoulder-surfing adversary, can observe the user's interactions during authentication. This is particularly relevant in AR/VR contexts and has been frequently considered in prior work, e.g., [57], [56], [62], [71].
- **Internal Observer (I):** This adversary can monitor sensors on the device, assuming the user accidentally installs a malicious app controlled by the adversary. Such threats are more pronounced in AR/VR due to the extensive sensor access.
- **Credential Stuffing (S):** This adversary has access to the user's stolen credentials from another verifier.

**Adversaries with physical access:**
- **Computation-bound Adversary (C):** This adversary can steal an AR/VR device and launch sophisticated software- and hardware-based attacks.
- **UI-bound Adversary (U):** This adversary has brief access to the device and can only interact via the provided user interface, such as in intimate partner violence (IPV) scenarios or curious colleagues. These adversaries are also known as offline and online guessing adversaries in password attack literature.

Combining multiple adversarial settings can make attacks more effective. For example, an imitation attack involves external observation followed by a UI-bound attack when the device is accessible. However, as discussed in Section VI, some prior work does not consider even a single adversarial setting.

### Users' and Developers' Perspectives on AR/VR Authentication

We conducted a survey to understand the experiences and concerns of users and developers with current authentication methods used in AR/VR devices. For users, we aimed to gather insights into their experiences, concerns, and needs. For developers, we explored whether they had incorporated authentication components into their AR/VR apps and how they chose these components. The results of this study informed our evaluation of existing and proposed authentication methods for AR and VR in Sections V and VI.

#### Survey Methodology

Our survey consisted of five sections: screening, developer experiences, device usage, authentication experiences, and demographics/follow-up. Participants had to be over 18 and familiar with AR or VR devices, either as users or developers. Familiarity was determined using a 7-point scale. If participants indicated minimal experience, they were not considered familiar. The survey was reviewed by our IRB and exempted as a human subject research study with minimal risk. We did not collect personally identifiable information except for email addresses, used solely for sending payments.

**Survey Promotion:**
We piloted the survey to ensure clarity and then promoted it on 24 online platforms, including Slack channels, university email lists, Twitter, Facebook groups, and Reddit threads. We incentivized participation with a chance to win a $50 gift card for every 25 participants. Incomplete or poor-quality responses were discarded.

**Data Analysis:**
We received 306 responses, of which 139 were valid after filtering. We analyzed quantitative data using descriptive statistics and qualitative data through thematic analysis. Three researchers coded the free-text answers, resulting in a codebook with 168 codes. We categorized the codes and identified twenty-one themes.

#### User Study Results

We received 139 valid responses, including 49 developers. A majority of participants were male, which may be attributed to gender disparities in AR/VR adoption, gaming, and Reddit communities.

**Developers' Authentication Decisions:**
Few AR/VR developers (29%) have deployed any authentication methods in their apps. There is a disparity between AR-only and VR-only developers: 50% of AR-only developers have deployed authentication, compared to 17% of VR-only developers. Of the fifteen developers who have deployed authentication, passwords (42%) and paired accounts (36%) were the most common choices. Ease of implementation, consistency across platforms, and usability influenced these decisions.

**Users' Exposure to Authentication:**
Participants have limited exposure to authentication mechanisms on AR/VR devices. Twenty-one AR users (54%) and eighty VR users (61%) have used authentication. Passwords are the most commonly used method, with 81% of AR users and 94% of VR users having used them.

**Perceived Security and Privacy:**
Twenty-eight participants consider AR/VR authentication as secure as other devices. Shoulder surfing is a major concern, with mixed opinions on its vulnerability in AR/VR. Some users believe large, visible gestures make AR/VR more vulnerable to shoulder surfing, while others disagree.

In summary, our study provides a detailed understanding of the current state of AR/VR authentication, highlighting the need for a tailored framework that addresses the unique challenges and requirements of these technologies.
