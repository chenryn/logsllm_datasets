  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
**Test file (self-contained)**
    import { test } from '@playwright/test';
    test('', async(fixtures, testInfo) => {
    	fixtures;
    });
According to docs, 1st argument of `testFunction` is Fixtures. However, when
actually writing code, I am seeing _properties_ of fixtures in addition to
fixtures:

This doesn't really make sense from the documentation point of since built-in
fixtures only list 6 fixtures. Further more, in Auth guide we are shown that
we can override `storageState` "fixture". However, `storageState` is really
property of Context fixture and not a standalone fixture.
I guess for newcomers it's a bit confusing since fixtures and their properties
are used interchangeably. For example, you can override the entire `Page`
class or just `storageState`. Also, it is not really stated that
`testFunction` splats fixtures where you can also access properties of the
fixtures. It's really confusing when you expect 6 fixtures but instead
presented with a list of dozens and not really sure (initially) where those
come from.
