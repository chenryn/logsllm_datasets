npm install doesn't work either way. After upgrading Node JS to v17.4.0 and
npm to v8.4.0 npm install gives two errors with different packages every time
which completely halts or crashes the process.

I felt I had this issue only on my machine so I checked out on different
machine with macOS platform and firstly it produces the above error and then
when ran second time it give the SOCKET_TIMEOUT error.
There's still more to this  
I checked with another machine with windows platform and sadly it doesn't work
there either. I tested it with a highspeed connection and it's still the same
:( .
