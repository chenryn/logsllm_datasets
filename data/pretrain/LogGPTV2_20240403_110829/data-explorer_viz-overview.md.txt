# Data visualization with Azure Data Explorer
Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data that is used to build complex analytics solutions for vast amounts of data. Azure Data Explorer integrates with various visualization tools, so you can visualize your data and share the results across your organization. This data can be transformed into actionable insights to make an impact on your business.
Data visualization and reporting is a critical step in the data analytics process. Azure Data Explorer supports many BI services so you can use the one that best fits your scenario and budget.
## Azure Data Explorer dashboards
Azure Data Explorer dashboards is a web application that enables you to run queries and build dashboards in the stand-alone web application, the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](web-query-data.md). Azure Data Explorer dashboards provide three main advantages:
* Natively export queries from the Azure Data Explorer web UI to Azure Data Explorer dashboards.
* Explore the data in the Azure Data Explorer web UI.
* Optimized dashboard rendering performance.
For more information, see, [Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards](azure-data-explorer-dashboards.md).
## Kusto Query Language visualizations
The Kusto Query Language [`render operator`](kusto/query/render-operator.md) offers various visualizations such as tables, pie charts, and bar charts to depict query results. Query visualizations are helpful in anomaly detection and forecasting, machine learning, and more.
## Power BI
Azure Data Explorer provides the capability to connect to [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) using various methods:
* [Built-in native Power BI connector](power-bi-data-connector.md?tabs=connector)
* [Query import from Azure Data Explorer into Power BI](power-bi-data-connector.md)
* [SQL query](power-bi-sql-query.md)
## Microsoft Excel
Azure Data Explorer provides the capability to connect to [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/excel) using the [built-in native Excel connector](excel-connector.md), or [import a query](excel-blank-query.md) from Azure Data Explorer into Excel.
## Grafana
[Grafana](https://grafana.com) provides an Azure Data Explorer plugin that enables you to visualize data from Azure Data Explorer. You [set up Azure Data Explorer as a data source for Grafana, and then visualize the data](grafana.md).
## Kibana
Azure Data Explorer provides the capability to connect to [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/6.8/discover.html) using K2Bridge, an open source connector. You [set up Azure Data Explorer as a data source for Kibana, and then visualize the data](k2bridge.md).
## ODBC connector
Azure Data Explorer provides an [Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) connector](connect-odbc.md) so any application that supports ODBC can connect to Azure Data Explorer.
## Tableau
Azure Data Explorer provides the capability to connect to [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com)
 using the [ODBC connector](connect-odbc.md) and then [visualize the data in Tableau](tableau.md).
## Qlik
Azure Data Explorer provides the capability to connect to [Qlik](https://www.qlik.com) using the [ODBC connector](connect-odbc.md) and then create Qlik Sense dashboards and visualize the data. Using the following video, you can learn to visualize Azure Data Explorer data with Qlik.
