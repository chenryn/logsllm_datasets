claim under Arizona law is not preempted by the Copyright
Act, but we vacate the grant of summary judgment because
there are outstanding issues of material fact.

VII.
The district court found that Donnelly was personally liable
for MDY’s tortious interference with contract, secondary
copyright infringement, and DMCA violations. We vacate the
district court’s decision because we determine that MDY is
not liable for secondary copyright infringement and is liable
under the DMCA only for violation of § 1201(a)(2) with
respect to WoW’s dynamic non-literal elements. In addition,
we conclude that summary judgment is inappropriate as to
Blizzard’s claim for tortious interference with contract under
Arizona law. Accordingly, on remand, the district court shall
reconsider the issue of Donnelly’s personal liability.
24 The
district court’s decision is VACATED and the case is
REMANDED to the district court for further proceedings
consistent with this opinion.
Each side shall bear its own costs.
23Because we determine that there are triable issues of fact, we need not,
and do not, address MDY’s further contentions: that (1) Blizzard has
unclean hands because it changed the ToU to ban bots after this litigation
began; and (2) MDY is not liable for tortious interference because it only
“honestly persuaded” people to buy Glider. 
24If MDY is found liable at trial for tortious interference with contract,
the district court may consider Donnelly’s personal liability for that tor-
tious interference. Moreover, the district court may determine whether
Donnelly is personally liable for MDY’s violation of DMCA § 1201(a)(2).
In light of the foregoing disposition regarding Donnelly’s personal liabil-
ity, we also vacate in toto the district court’s permanent injunction against
Donnelly, though the district court may consider the propriety of an
injunction against Donnelly if it finds him liable for MDY’s § 1201(a)(2)
violations or for tortious interference with contract.
