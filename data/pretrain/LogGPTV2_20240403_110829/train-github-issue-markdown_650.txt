**Current behavior**  
A change of value of a date input control (that is created using ngFor and
that is bound to an item in an array) modifies the value of the succeeding
control.
**Expected behavior**  
A modification of date input control value should only be applied to the
selected date input control.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
