### Other Distribution Models and Their Implications

Alternative distribution models, such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), could potentially mitigate certain risks but may also limit the utility for the research community. We believe that determined attackers will still find ways to target sites even without Basta-COSI. Therefore, we prioritize the benefits for defenders and the research community.

### VI. Experiments

This section evaluates Basta-COSI on four open-source web applications (HotCRP, GitLab, GitHub Enterprise, OpenCart) and 58 websites from the Alexa Top 150 where we could create user accounts. These targets are popular and allow us to test both white-box (open-source) and black-box (deployed) scenarios, covering services with multiple user states. Section VI-A presents the results for web applications, Section VI-B for Alexa websites, and Section VI-C details some of the attacks discovered.

#### A. Evaluation on Web Applications

Table V summarizes the results of applying Basta-COSI to the four web applications we installed locally. It details the outcomes for each tool module and the COSI attacks found.

- **Data Collection**: This part shows the number of input state scripts provided to Basta-COSI, the number of URLs crawled, and the number of SD-URLs identified.
- **Attack Vector Identification**: This part lists the total number of attack vectors identified, the number of state pairs they cover, and the number of XS-Leaks used.
- **Attack Page Generation**: This part indicates the number of states uniquely distinguished (UD) from other states, the number of states partially distinguished (PD) excluding UD states, and the minimum/average/maximum attack vectors in the attack pages.
- **Attacks Found**: This part specifies the type and browsers affected by the identified attacks.

For each target, we created 3â€“6 state scripts for Basta-COSI. One script always corresponds to the logged-out (LO) state, and the others are specific to the target. For example, for GitLab, the additional states are for maintainer, developer, reporter, guest (read-only access), and a user with no read access to the repository. Like a fuzzing tool, Basta-COSI continues to search for attacks until the allocated time budget is exhausted. We allowed Basta-COSI to run for up to 24 hours on each target, although after a few hours, the crawling typically does not discover new URLs.

The data collection results show that SD-URLs are very common, with an average of 68% of the discovered URLs being SD-URLs (up to 99% in GitHub). Basta-COSI identifies between 58 and 992 attack vectors in each target, using up to 3 XS-Leaks. The results indicate that, on average, the generated attack pages use more than one attack vector. Account type and deanonymization attacks always require multiple vectors, while login detection is often possible with a single vector. This underscores the importance of combining attack vectors to handle more than two states and multiple browsers.

Some states can be uniquely identified, i.e., distinguished from any other state, and the rest can be partially distinguished. No state was found that could not be distinguished at all. It is important to note that partially distinguishable states can also be used in attacks. For example, if the administrator cannot be differentiated from a normal user, it does not matter if the administrator is not targeted by the attack, i.e., not sent the attack page URL.

Overall, Basta-COSI discovers attacks on all four applications: login detection attacks on all four, deanonymization attacks on three, and account type identification on two.

#### B. Evaluation on Websites

We tested websites from the Alexa Top 150 that are not duplicates (e.g., amazon.com vs. amazon.de) and where we could create free accounts. This excludes sites without user accounts, those requiring a phone number in a specific area, or those demanding credit card information. This leaves us with 58 sites, of which only 12 support SSO, and only 3 have multiple types of free accounts (excluding the administrator account that we cannot create). For access detection, we focused on privacy-sensitive sites, specifically adult sites, in the Alexa Top 150, regardless of whether they have user accounts.

Table VI summarizes the number of tested and vulnerable sites for each attack type. Basta-COSI discovers XS-Leaks against all tested sites for login detection, SSO status, and account type identification. Additionally, it finds deanonymization attacks in 57% of the sites and access detection attacks in 45%. The results show that login detection attacks are the easiest to find, but by combining multiple attack vectors, it is possible to find more powerful attacks targeting more than two states in 72% of the sites.

Regarding false positives, we rarely observed them in two situations: one due to Basta-COSI waiting 6 seconds to collect events and some pages loading slowly, and the other when Basta-COSI sent too many queries, causing sites to reply with CAPTCHAs. We expect that increasing the timeout and distributing queries over multiple IPs would eliminate these false positives. We do not evaluate false negatives, as we lack ground truth for the COSI attacks present in the targets. However, we acknowledge that, like any testing tool, false negatives are possible, e.g., Basta-COSI can only find COSI attacks that are instances of the 40 attack classes it supports.

The support in Basta-COSI for multiple XS-Leaks and multiple browsers allows for comparing the prevalence of XS-Leaks and the attack surface of browsers on the same set of SD-URLs.
