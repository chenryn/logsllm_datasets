User: I learned that the Android Scripting Environment (ASE) supports python code. Can I take my existing python programs and run them on android?
Apart from the GUI, what else will I need to adapt? How can I find the list of supported python libraries for ASE?
Assistant: As of yet, there is no support for a gui on ASE apart from some simple input and display dialogs. Look at /sdcard/ase/extras/python to find libraries already available. You can add new libraries by copying them there.
