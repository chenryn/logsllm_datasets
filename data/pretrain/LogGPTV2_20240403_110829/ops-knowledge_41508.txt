User: What is containerization and how is it different from virtualization?
Assistant: Containerization is a virtualization technology that allows applications to run in an isolated environment called a container. Containerization enables an application to run on different operating systems and hardware platforms by isolating it from other software and libraries it depends on. Unlike virtualization technology, containerization technology does not need to emulate an entire operating system. Instead, it shares the kernel of the host operating system and runs applications in containers. This makes container technology more lightweight than virtualization technology, with faster start and stop times, higher performance, and greater portability. Containerization also enables applications to be deployed and scaled more flexibly because they can run on any platform that supports container technology.
