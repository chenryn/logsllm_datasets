### Node Stability and Clique Analysis in Distributed Systems

#### 1. Introduction
The distinction between stable and unstable nodes in a distributed system can become blurred, especially when considering the allowed levels of Round-Trip Time (RTT) variations. To address this, we set thresholds to classify pairs of nodes as stable or unstable. Nodes with RTT variations below a certain threshold are classified as stable.

#### 2. Node Classification
Nodes are classified based on their RTT stability over time. The classification is determined by setting different thresholds for RTT variations. For example, a threshold of 400 ms, 600 ms, 1000 ms, and 2000 ms can be used to differentiate between stable and unstable nodes. 

- **Threshold 400 ms:** Indicates very high stability.
- **Threshold 600 ms:** Indicates high stability.
- **Threshold 1000 ms:** Indicates moderate stability.
- **Threshold 2000 ms:** Indicates low stability.

  - Threshold 600 ms
  - Threshold 1000 ms
  - Threshold 2000 ms
- **Time Intervals:**
  - 11/1000:00
  - 12/1000:00
  - 13/1000:00
  - 14/1000:00
  - 15/1000:00
  - 16/1000:00
  - 17/1000:00
  - 18/1000:00

#### 3. Maximum Clique Analysis
Another interesting result is obtained when the maximum clique is computed from the intersection of all graphs with a given threshold. This clique corresponds to a group of nodes that remained stable throughout the experiment, i.e., each node in the clique classifies each other as stable in all graphs.

**Table 1. Maximum Clique Size on the Intersection of All Graphs**
- **Experiment 1:**
  - Threshold 400 ms: 59
  - Threshold 600 ms: 91
  - Threshold 1000 ms: 117
  - Threshold 2000 ms: 149
- **Experiment 2:**
  - Threshold 200 ms: 78
  - Threshold 400 ms: 153
  - Threshold 600 ms: 196
- **Experiment 3:**
  - Threshold 200 ms: 42
  - Threshold 400 ms: 85
  - Threshold 600 ms: 114

#### 4. Conclusions
The results show that it is possible to identify stable nodes in a distributed system using RTT variation thresholds. The maximum clique size provides a measure of the stability of the network. In future work, we aim to develop a tool for PlanetLab that accepts the desired clique size and returns a suggested set of nodes to be employed. Additionally, we will explore the use of adaptive monitoring to continuously update the stability classification.
