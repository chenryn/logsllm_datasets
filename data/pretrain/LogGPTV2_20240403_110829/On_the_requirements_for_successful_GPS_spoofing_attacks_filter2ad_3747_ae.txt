by inaccuracies in the delay setup in the case of military GPS sig-
nals. In this experiment, we evaluate the consequences of having
half of the spoofed satellite signals shifted by a ﬁxed amount of
time relative to the other half of the signals.
In Figure 8(c), we
show an example run with a time delay mismatch of 140ns. Our
results for all tested values are presented in Figure 8(d).
Summary of experiments: We conducted the above experiments
in order to evaluate the effects of imperfections in the attacker’s
signals for lock-takeovers. As these effects are inﬂuenced by the
actual hardware at the receivers, the exact values might differ for
other types of receivers, but the fundamental relations will remain
the same. The results are summarized in Table 3.
According to our experiments, the attacker must ensure that his
time offset to the system time is less than 75ns. Any greater offset
will cause the GPS receiver to lose lock when the spooﬁng signal
is turned on. A value of 75ns roughly corresponds to a distance of
22.5m, meaning that the attacker must know his distance from the
victim with an accuracy of 22.5m (or better)— a higher offset will
cause the victim to lose lock due to the signal (chip phase) mis-
alignment. We conﬁrmed that the initial location offset will cause
83the rotated and translated satellite position of the GPS signal. Con-
ducting such an attack is very difﬁcult. It becomes even impossible
if the victim can hide the exact positioning of at least one GPS re-
ceiver from the attacker (e. g., by keeping it mobile on the vehicle)
such that the attacker cannot adapt to its position.
In summary, our countermeasure requires no modiﬁcations of
the GPS signal, the satellite infrastructure, or the GPS receiver, it is
resistant against a wide range of attackers, and it can be deployed
using multiple standard GPS receivers.
Outlook: Further possible applications are not restricted to mobile
scenarios with a ﬁxed formation (such as in the cargo ship exam-
ple above). The countermeasure can also be applied (i) to ﬁxed and
static (i. e., immobile) settings where GPS is used for time synchro-
nization and (ii) to mobile settings with varying formations (e. g.,
mobile formation of cars, robots, etc.). In the latter case, the de-
vices can apply additional ranging techniques to identify their for-
mation and use it in the sanity check with the calculated GPS loca-
tions (as long as the ranging techniques are secure [2,6,10,18,21]).
We leave the elaboration of these ideas for future work.
7. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we analyzed the requirements for successful GPS
spooﬁng attacks on individuals and groups of victims with civilian
or military GPS receivers. In particular, we identiﬁed from which
locations and with which precision the attacker needs to generate
its signals in order to successfully spoof the receivers.
For example, we show how spooﬁng a group of victims can only
be achieved from a restricted set of locations, if the attacker aims to
preserve the mutual distances and time offsets of the victims. With
growing size of the group of victims, less spooﬁng location become
available, until only single points remain for 5 victims or more. In
addition, we discussed the practical aspects of seamless satellite-
lock takeover. We used a GPS signal generator to perform a set
of experiments in which we investigated the required precision of
the attacker’s spooﬁng signals. Besides demonstrating the effects
of such lock takeovers on the victim, our results include minimal
bounds for critical parameters to allow a seamless takeover of our
target platform. Finally, we proposed a technique for the detection
of spooﬁng based on a group of standard GPS receivers (without
speciﬁc spooﬁng detection measures) in a static formation.

a noticeable jump of the victim’s reported position during the at-
tack. Large offsets could therefore be detected by the victim by
monitoring its position. Any imperfections in the arrival time of
the signal from different antennas will directly impact the position
calculated by the victim. If the relative time offset gets above 80ns,
the signals will even cause the receiver to lose lock. This means
that, if an attacker has multiple antennas, he must precisely know
the distance from each antenna to the attacker in order to be able to
spoof a desired location. We could also observe a general localiza-
tion error as predicted in our theoretical analysis, even for smaller
mismatches in the arrival times.
6. GPS SPOOFING COUNTERMEASURE
Spooﬁng detection based on lock loss has two disadvantages: (i)
strong attackers can achieve a seamless satellite-lock takeover, and
(ii) lock loss can occur due to natural causes (e. g. signal loss in
a tunnel). We propose a countermeasure against GPS spooﬁng at-
tacks that does not rely on the signal analysis or on the lock loss
of signal. Instead, our mechanism is based on our insights of Sec-
tion 4 and relies on the use of several GPS receivers. These GPS
receivers can be deployed in a static, known formation, e. g., they
are ﬁxed on the deck of a cargo ship (see Figure 9). The basic idea
of the countermeasure is the following: If the GPS receivers can
exchange their individual GPS locations, they can check if their
calculated locations preserve their physical formation (within cer-
tain error bounds). In the case that the calculated GPS locations do
not match the known formation, an attack must be suspected and
there should be a warning message.
Even if only two GPS receivers are used, this countermeasure
can detect any attacker that is only using a single antenna. As
shown in Result 1, in case of a single-antenna attack both GPS
receivers would report the same location (with small time offsets).
As shown in Results 4–6, a strong attacker using multiple an-
tennas could attempt to send signals such that the mutual distances
between multiple receivers are preserved. Nevertheless, each addi-
tional receiver of the victim makes these spooﬁng attacks exceed-
ingly more difﬁcult because the space of possible antenna place-
ments for the attacker gets reduced signiﬁcantly (see Table 2). From
Results 6 and 7 we know that there exists only one location per
satellite where the attacker can place his antenna; this location is

Result 1 shows that an attacker can make a group of victims be-

nals from the same antenna. All victims will believe to be at the
same location L(cid:48), but with different time offsets. The additional
