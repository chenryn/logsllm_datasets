### Analysis of Error Reporting and Correction in Ad-Blocking Systems

#### 1. User Contributions and Response Times

- **Average Days Between Report and Correction:**
  - The "SD" (standard deviation) represents the variability in the time periods between submitting a report and correcting the error.

- **User Categories:**
  - **New Member:** Users with fewer than ten posts in the forums.
  - **Senior Member:** Long-term registered users who are more active.
  - **Veteran:** Users recognized by forum administrators for significant contributions to error reporting and bug correction.
  - **Developer:** Software developers of ad-blocking tools.
  - **Other List Editor:** Authors of non-English or privacy filter lists.

- **Contributions and Response Times:**
  - Anonymous users made the highest number of error reports, particularly for False Positive (FP) errors.
  - FP errors were predominantly reported by anonymous and new members, while False Negative (FN) errors were more evenly distributed among four user categories.
  - EasyList editors prioritized FP errors, as evidenced by faster response times and lower standard deviations for resolving these errors.
  - However, editors responded more quickly to FN reports from anonymous users compared to FP reports.
  - The high contribution from anonymous users and the rapid response from editors raise concerns about the credibility of the reports.

- **Individual Contribution Variability:**
  - From dataset D2A, we calculated the number of error reports submitted by individual users.
  - Table 3 shows the average number and standard deviation of FP and FN error reports submitted by each user category, excluding anonymous users due to their lack of permanent profiles.
  - Veterans had the highest activity in correcting both FP and FN errors, while Developers tended to correct more FP errors than FN errors.

#### 2. Impact on Websites

- **Website Popularity and Error Prevalence:**
  - We analyzed the prevalence of FP and FN errors based on website popularity, using Alexa's ranking service.
  - Alexa ranks websites based on traffic volume, covering over one million sites with historical data for the past four years.
  - To improve reliability, we used the premium API to obtain a 3-month average rank and grouped websites into coarse-grained ranges to mitigate ranking fluctuations.
  - We validated our findings using Cisco Umbrella, focusing on the top one million domains.

- **Classification of Websites:**
  - Websites were classified into seven classes based on Alexa rank:
    - Top 500
    - No Rank (NR): Small websites with insufficient traffic data
    - 500-5K, 5K-100K, 100K-1M, 1M-10M, 10M-20M
  - Figure 2 shows that over 53% of FN error reports and 57.8% of FP error reports came from websites ranked within the top 100K.
  - Using Umbrella, 30% of FN and 44% of FP error reports were from websites ranked within the top 100K.
  - Class-NR websites also had a significant number of FN and FP errors.

- **Statistical Analysis:**
  - Table 4 presents the results of Pearson’s chi-squared test, likelihood-ratio chi-squared test, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient test.
  - For Editors and Other List Editors, there was no evidence against the null hypothesis of independence between error types and website ranks.
  - For Anonymous, New Members, Senior Members, and Veterans, there was a negative correlation, indicating that these users corrected more FP errors for lower-ranked websites.

#### 3. Duration of FP Errors

- **Error Duration:**
  - We calculated the interval between when an element is blocked and when the error is reported.
  - Figure 3 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the delay in reporting errors.
  - 25% of the websites had low error durations, with 15% having durations of less than one day.
  - Over 50% of the websites had error durations exceeding one month.
  - The 100K class had the highest percentage of short error durations, while the NR class had the longest error durations.

#### 4. Causes of FP Errors

- **Possible Reasons:**
  - FP errors can occur due to:
    - EasyList adding filters that unintentionally block non-ad content.
    - Website designers creating elements that fall within the scope of existing EasyList filters.
  - Ad-blocking software either blocks HTTP GET requests or hides page elements.

- **Responsibility Breakdown:**
  - Table 5 breaks down the responsibilities for FP errors based on who introduced the elements first.
  - For example, if website designers first used an element that was later blocked by EasyList, the designers are responsible.

- **Element Types and FP Errors:**
  - We analyzed the association between element types and FP errors, identifying specific types that are more prone to causing FP errors.

By understanding these factors, future work can aim to improve the accuracy of ad-blocking systems and prevent potential threats.
