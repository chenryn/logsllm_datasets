### Title: Living Off the Walled Garden: Abusing the Features of the Early Launch Antimalware Ecosystem

**Abstract:**

The Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) functionality in Windows provides robust anti-tampering mitigations by allowing security vendors to declare a Microsoft-approved list of explicitly allowed signers for Protected Process Light (PPL) services. Microsoft emphasizes that these mitigations are "best-effort" and part of a "defense-in-depth" strategy, acknowledging that they may not be foolproof.

This talk will delve into why these mitigations are considered "best-effort" and ultimately indefensible. We will present a methodology for assessing ELAM drivers and demonstrate scenarios where overly permissive rules create opportunities for adversaries to abuse the intended functionality, rather than exploiting vulnerabilities. Specifically, a single, overly permissive ELAM driver can enable an adversary to tamper with security products and provide malware with anti-tampering protections, thereby hindering detection and remediation efforts.

The presentation will conclude with a live demonstration of gaining user-mode code execution through an abusable, signed executable running with an antimalware-light protection level. This demo will illustrate the practical implications of the discussed methodologies and highlight the potential risks associated with overly permissive ELAM configurations.
