graphs. Therefore, we use the MontereyBay Facebook graph and
the AS network topology graph in this experiment.
For both AS and MontereyBay graphs and each of the three inﬂu-
ence dissemination models, Figure 9 shows the expected number of
inﬂuenced nodes when increasing the number of initial seed nodes.
While the actual percentage of users inﬂuenced varies across dis-
semination models, there are clear and visible trends. Results on
the AS graph in Figures 9(a), 9(b), 9(c) all show that Pygmalion
with  = 100 and the dK-synthetic graph without noise are al-
most identical to the original AS graph under all three dissemina-
tion models. Graphs with stronger protection, Pygmalion  = 10
and  = 5, progressively diverge from the results of the AS graph.
Results on the MontereyBay graph are shown in Figures 9(d), 9(e),
9(f), and are quite similar to those on the AS graph. They conﬁrm
that Pygmalion  = 100 produces near perfect results, but higher

5.3 Summary
We have used both popular graph metrics and application-level
tests to evaluate the feasibility of using differentially private syn-
thetic graphs in research. Our tests are not comprehensive, and
cannot capture all graph metrics or application-level experiments.
However, they are instructive because they show the observable im-
pact on graph structure and research results when we replace real
graphs with differentially private Pygmalion graphs.
Our results consistently show that Pygmalion introduces limited
impact as a result of adding noise to guarantee privacy.
In fact,
many of the largest errors can be attributed to limitations of the
dK-2 series. Given the signiﬁcant demand for realistic graphs in
the research community, we expect that generator algorithms for
more complex dK models will be discovered soon. Moving to
those models, e.g. dK-3, will eliminate a signiﬁcant source of error
in these results.
6. CONCLUSION
We study the problem of developing a ﬂexible graph privacy
mechanism that preserves graph structures while providing user-
speciﬁed levels of privacy guarantees. We introduce Pygmalion,
a differentially-private graph model that aims these goals using
the dK-series as a graph transformation function. First, we use
analysis to show that this function has a high sensitivity, i.e. ap-
plied naively, it requires addition of high levels of noise to obtain
privacy guarantees. We conﬁrm this on both social and Internet
graphs. Second, we develop and prove a partitioned privacy tech-
nique where differential privacy is achieved as a whole when it is
achieved in each data cluster. This effectively reduces the level of
noise necessary to attain a given level of privacy.
We evaluate our model on numerous graphs that range in size
from 14K nodes to 1.7 million nodes. Our partitioned privacy tech-
nique reduces the required noise by an order of magnitude. For
moderate to weak levels of privacy guarantees, the resulting syn-
thetic graphs closely match the original graphs in both graph struc-
ture and behavior under application-level experiments.
We believe our results represent a promising ﬁrst step towards
enabling open access to realistic graphs with privacy guarantees.
The accuracy of our current model is fundamentally limited by
both the degree of descriptiveness of dK-2 series, and the high
noise necessary to inject privacy properties. There are two ways to
improve our results. One way is to use a more descriptive, higher-
order dK model, under the assumption that its sensitivity is rea-
sonable low. While generators for higher order dK-models are still
unknown, our techniques are general, and can be applied to obtain
more accurate models as higher-order dK generators are discov-
ered. Another way to improve is to discover a function (or model)
of graph structure with much lower sensitivity. If such a function
exists, it can potentially lower the noise required for a given privacy
level by orders of magnitude.
