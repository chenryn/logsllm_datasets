User: Is it possible in python to kill a process that is listening on a specific port, say for example 8080?
I can do netstat -ltnp | grep 8080 and kill -9 <pid> OR execute a shell command from python but I wonder if there is already some module that contains API to kill process by port or name?
Assistant: First of all, processes don't run on ports - processes can bind to specific ports. A specific port/IP combination can only be bound to by a single process at a given point in time.
As Toote says, psutil gives you the netstat functionality. You can also use os.kill to send the kill signal (or do it Toote's way).
