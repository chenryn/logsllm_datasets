#### Over-Privileged Apps
Over-privileged apps are those that request more permissions in their `AndroidManifest.xml` than they actually use in their functionalities. Previous research [97] suggests that more than 85% of Android apps published on vendor-customized phones suffer from this issue. Permissions serve as an explicit declaration of what sensitive resources an app will use [91, 93]. Over-privileging an app is undesirable because:
1. It violates the principle of least privilege [2].
2. It exposes users to unnecessary permission warnings.
3. It increases the attack surface [44] and the impact of the presence of a bug or vulnerability [54].

To identify over-privileged apps, we first build a permission map that identifies what sensitive permissions are needed for each API call/Intent/Content Provider. We then use static analysis to determine the permission-related invocations made by the app. Finally, we compare the actual permissions used by the app with the requested permissions listed in `AndroidManifest.xml`. For this, we leveraged data provided by PScout [26, 41], specifically a list of 32,445 permission-related APIs, 97 permission-related Intents, 78 Content Providers URI Strings, and 996 Content Provider URI fields.

In general, apps published in Chinese markets tend to request more sensitive permissions, labeled as dangerous by Google [10], than those in Google Play. Figure 11 shows the distribution of over-privileged apps across markets grouped by the number of excess permissions each app has. Approximately 65% of the apps in Google Play are over-privileged, while the percentage in Chinese markets is roughly 82%. In two particular cases (25PP and App China), more than 95% of the apps requested at least one unused permission. The most common over-privileged sensitive permissions are:
- `READ_PHONE_STATE` (52.38%)
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` (36.28%)
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` (33.83%)
- `CAMERA` (19.98%)

### Malware Prevalence

To investigate the presence of malicious and undesirable apps, we uploaded all the apps to VirusTotal [31], an online analysis service that aggregates more than 60 anti-virus engines. Previous studies [40, 96] have suggested that some anti-virus engines may not always report reliable results. To address potential false positives, we analyzed the results grouped by the number of engines (AV-rank) flagging a sample as malware. A threshold of 10 engines is considered robust [40, 61, 100].

**Overall Results:**
- Roughly 50% of the apps in Chinese markets are flagged by at least one anti-virus engine, while the percentage for Google Play is considerably lower (17.03%).
- According to the threshold of "AV-rank ≥ 10," around 2% of the apps in Google Play are labeled as malware, while the percentage in Chinese markets is much higher.
- For 11 out of the 16 Chinese markets, the percentage of malware exceeds 10%. The PC Online market, in particular, has more than 24% of its apps labeled as potentially malicious.
- In absolute terms, Tencent and 22PP markets host the largest number of malicious apps (70,988 and 83,655, respectively).
- On the other hand, Huawei’s market has a figure (4.71%) comparable to that of Google Play (2.09%).

**Top Malware:**
Table 5 lists the top 10 malicious apps according to their AV-Rank. Two of them (com.trustport.mobilesecurity_eicar_test_file and com.zoner.android.eicar) correspond to the AV benchmarking apps developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR). The remaining apps clearly show potentially malicious behaviors. For example, `com.ypt.merchant`, published in 5 markets, poses as a legitimate mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) for merchants and individuals.

**Repackaged Malware:**
The Android Genome Project [103] suggested that app repackaging is the main way for malware distribution, with 86% of 1,260 samples being repackaged malware. However, this dataset is outdated (collected in 2011) and the number of samples is relatively small, so it may no longer provide a representative picture of the current Android malware landscape. Our analysis shows that only 38.3% of the malware samples in our dataset are repackaged apps, suggesting that app repackaging is no longer the main way for malware spreading.

**Malware Families:**
We further analyzed the distribution of malware families across Google Play and Chinese markets using AVClass [83]. The most popular malware family in Chinese markets is kuguo (12.69%), while it only corresponds to 0.6% of malware in Google Play. Roughly 45% of the malware present in Google Play belongs to the family airpush (29.04%) and revmob (15.09%). The distribution of malware families differs greatly between Google Play and Chinese markets.

### Post-Analysis

All markets have strict policies to conduct copyright and security checks. However, our results reveal that they still host a significant amount of fake and cloned apps, as well as malware samples. We performed a second crawl for each app store about 8 months after the first one to quantify whether the stores made any effort to remove those samples from their catalogs. Over 84% of the potential malicious apps found in Google Play have been removed. However, the percentages of malware removal in Chinese alternative markets vary from 0.01% (PC Online) to 34.51% (Wandoujia).

### Discussion

Our results reveal that potentially malicious and deceptive activities are more common in Chinese markets than in Google Play. Tencent Myapp, one of the largest Chinese app stores by their aggregate number of downloads, hosts a significant amount of mobile malware. Despite claims of manual inspection, empirical observations suggest otherwise. Similar behavior is observed for PC Online.

### Conclusion

In this work, we conducted a large-scale mobile app analysis to understand various features of several Chinese Android app stores and how they compare to Google Play. Our analysis covers over 6 million Android apps obtained from 16 Chinese app markets and Google Play. Overall, our results suggest that there are substantial differences between the Chinese app ecosystem and Google Play, though some minor commonalities are also found. We identified a significant number of developers and third-party services specialized in the Chinese market. We also found a higher prevalence of fake, cloned, and malicious apps in Chinese stores than in Google Play, possibly due to market operators' indulgence.
