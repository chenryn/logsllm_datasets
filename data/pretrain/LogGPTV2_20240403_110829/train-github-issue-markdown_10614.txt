  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate. There is a related issue #2769, but it's slightly different and what was described there seems to be working now.
## Expected Behavior
When I provide an absolute `distDir`, it works.
## Current Behavior
Because `path.join(dir, config.distDir)` is used everywhere, the path doesn't
make sense and mkdirp fails (I guess other parts of Next.js would fail too if
not for mkdirp failing first).
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Create a custom server with the following configuration:
    const app = next({
      dev,
      dir: __dirname,
      conf: {
        distDir: path.resolve('.foobar'),
      },
    });
  2. Launch this server.
## Context
I'm creating a tool that uses Next.js internally. As such, I'd like to keep
stuff like `pages/` inside my package while putting the dist dir inside the
project.
Issue #2769 describes a situation where paths like `'../.foobar'` not working,
but it doesn't seem to be the case now. That's why I can use the workaround of
`path.relative(dir, path.resolve('.foobar'))`. But if `path.resolve(dir,
config.distDir)` was used instead of `path.join(dir, config.distDir)`, other
people could avoid this pitfall in the future.
