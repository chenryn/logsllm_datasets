ABSTRACT
Many security job ads mention that security certiﬁcates are
regarded as assets, giving the candidate an advantage. For
some high-proﬁle jobs, certiﬁcation may even be required.
No matter where one stands on the subject of certiﬁca-
tion, the assumption is that the imparted knowledge is at
least factually correct. We examine the cryptography sec-
tion in the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) underly-
ing the most sought-after certiﬁcation, the CISSP, issued by
the International Information Systems Security Certiﬁcation
Consortium, Inc., or “(ISC)2”12 [4].
We ﬁnd many mistakes, some positively dangerous: peo-
ple who believe what they read there will build systems
that are less secure than they would have built if they had
looked to, say, Wikipedia instead. They include: a confusion
of encryption and authentication; an unconditional recom-
mendation of RC4 for key sizes over 128 bits; a belief that
block ciphers are inherently stronger than stream ciphers;
and many more. These mistakes are elementary and appear
in the third edition of the CBK, indicating that two pre-
ceding editing cycles were not enough to remove them. This
shows that no one knows or cares that the material is wrong.
This poses dilemmas for graduates and companies. Grad-
uates can either obtain a CISSP despite the factual inaccura-
cies, thereby surrendering at least part of their professional
integrity; or they can try to tough it out, thereby lowering
their chances of getting a high-proﬁle security job. Compa-
nies must either keep using the CISSP, knowing that they
have been taught some dangerous nonsense, or ﬁnd another
way to assess a candidate’s security knowledge.

INTRODUCTION
For many HR departments, certiﬁcations are the simple
answer to the questions of how to assess someone who ap-
plies for a security job, and how to ﬁlter out more experi-
enced candidates from the newcomers. First, a trusted third
party is vouching for the technical competence of the can-
didate. Second, one common prerequisite for certiﬁcation
is a certain job experience. Additionally, certiﬁcations need
to be renewed periodically, ensuring that the candidate’s
knowledge is current.
One important certiﬁcation is the Certiﬁed Information
Systems Security Professional (CISSP), oﬀered by the (ISC)2.
Founded in 1988, the (ISC)2’s self-stated mission is to
make society safer by improving productivity, ef-
ﬁciency and resilience of information-dependent
economies through information security educa-
tion and certiﬁcation.
The (ISC)2’s main educational vehicle is the “(ISC)2 Com-
mon Body of Knowledge”, or CBK. In the (ISC)2’s words,
(ISC)2 develops and maintains the (ISC)2 CBK,
a compendium of information security topics. The
CBK is a critical body of knowledge that deﬁnes
global industry standards, serving as a common
framework of terms and principles that our cre-
dentials are based upon and allows professionals
worldwide to discuss, debate, and resolve matters
pertaining to the ﬁeld. Subject matter experts
continually review and update the CBK.3
The CBK for the CISSP is organised into ten so-called do-
mains, such as Access Control, Application Development

isc2.org/aboutus/default.aspx
Security, Telecommunications and Network Security, and
Cryptography. Demonstration of knowledge of the CBK is
required to pass the CISSP certiﬁcation test.
The most recent version of the “Oﬃcial (ISC)2 Guide to
the CISSP CBK” is the third edition, published in Decem-
ber 2012 [4]. This means that two editing cycles have pre-
sumably been used to “review and update” the material by
“subject matter experts”. We believe that the third edition
of a book published by a self-styled “elite” organisation of
experts, on a topic where details matter so much, should be
about as error-free as it gets.
We only have the Kindle edition of the CBK, so we can
only give “location markers” instead of page numbers. We
will write them like so: [L. 12345].
All quotes from the CBK have been carefully checked to
be letter-accurate (but errors may still have occurred). This
includes any stylistic, spelling, or grammar issues.
2. CRYPTOGRAPHY
In addition to the selection of dangerous errors cited be-
low, this section also contains a number of annoyances4,
which mainly betray a lack of care, and “wait, what?” mo-
ments, where the text makes no sense at all. These, and
more dangerous errors, will feature on the ﬁnal poster.
By dangerous errors we mean errors that, if believed and
applied by students, result in system that are less secure
than if they hadn’t had that wrong information or had looked
it up in a reliable reference. Or even a not necessarily reli-
able one: as of today, the relevant Wikipedia articles were
all more accurate than what we read in the CBK.
Relative Strengths of Block and Stream Ciphers. The
author seems to believe that block ciphers are inherently
stronger than stream ciphers:
Most block ciphers use a combination of substi-
tution and transposition to perform their opera-
tions. This makes block ciphers relatively stron-
ger than most stream-based ciphers, but more
computationally intensive and usually more ex-
pensive to implement. This is also why many
stream-based ciphers are implemented in hard-
ware, whereas a block-based cipher is implemen-
ted in software. [L. 15034]
We found nothing in the peer-reviewed literature that would
support such statements. Also, if block ciphers were slower
than stream ciphers, wouldn’t it make more sense to imple-
ment block ciphers in hardware rather than the already-fast
stream ciphers?
Encryption and Authentication. One beginner’s mistake
is to assume that symmetric encryption per se can help with
authentication or freshness:
If two parties share a symmetric key, and they
have been careful not to disclose that key to any-
one else, then when they transmit a message from
one to another, they have assurance that the mes-
sage is indeed from their trusted partner. [L. 15242]
4Having to deal with a text whose sample plaintexts include
“I Hate Bed Time” [L. 15089] is an annoyance in itself.
Related to this is the notion that modifying an encrypted
message in transit makes it completely undecipherable, thus
providing integrity checking:
In many cases, they would also have some de-
gree of conﬁdence in the integrity of the message,
because any errors or modiﬁcations of the mes-
sage in transit would render the message unde-
cipherable. With chaining-type algorithms, any
error is likely to destroy the remainder of the
message. [L. 15224]
A modiﬁed ciphertext will decipher just ﬁne, it’s just that
some of the deciphered data will be junk. Also, some chain-
ing modes like Cipher Block Chaining have a self-healing
property where a modiﬁed ciphertext block leads to only a
small number of corrupted decrypted plaintext blocks.
RC4. In the section on RC4 [L. 15572], we read:
