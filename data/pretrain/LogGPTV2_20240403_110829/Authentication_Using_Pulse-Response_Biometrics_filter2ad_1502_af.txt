several weeks apart. The reason for the performance decrease
over time is that samples taken far apart are inﬂuenced by very
different conditions. There might be physiological changes such
as a loss or gain of weight, or there might be differences in the
ambient temperature, clothing, or a number of other factors.
Table I summarizes our results for the two classiﬁers,
authentication and identiﬁcation, on both, the single data set
and the data set taken over time.
Both classiﬁers can be tuned by selecting a speciﬁc false
positive rate, acceptable for the scenario in which the classiﬁer
is being used. For example if the classiﬁers are being used in a
continuous authentication application and false negatives are a
12
problem, the classiﬁers can be tuned for a lower false negative
rate, by accepting a higher false positive rate. Figure 12 shows
the relationship between false positives and true positives. The
classiﬁers can operate on any point on this curve, if desired.
VIII. RELATED WORK
Biometrics, as a means of recognizing an individual using
physiological or behavioural traits, has been an active research
area for many years. A comprehensive survey of conventional
physiological biometrics can be found in [13]). While physio-
logical biometrics tend to be relatively stable over time, they
are sensitive to deception attacks. These include attacks on:
(1) ﬁngerprint identiﬁcation, e.g., using mock ﬁngers made of
glycerine, gelatine or silicon [1], [2], (2) facial recognition,
e.g., using photographs or 3D models of an actual user [3],
[22], and (3) iris scan, e.g., using patterned contact lenses that
replicate a genuine user’s iris [8].
In contrast, behavioural biometrics are much harder to
circumvent. However, performance of systems that implement
behavioral biometrics, in terms of false rejection rates (FRR)
and false acceptance rates (FAR), is much lower and can require
re-calibration due to varying and often erratic nature of human
behaviour. Initial results on behavioral biometrics were focused
on typing and mouse movements, see, e.g., [4], [24], [29]. In
particular, keystroke dynamics gained lots of popularity through
[18], where it was used to augment password authentication
similarly to our pin-entry scenario. Keystroke dynamics is
another method that could be combined with our PIN entry
scenario, but it requires longer sampling duration to work well.
A survey on the large body of literature on biometrics using
keystroke dynamics is given in [16]. In contrast to keystroke
dynamics, some studies on mouse movements argue that it
should not be used as biometrics, as it is too unreliable [26],
while others report high accuracies [9], [19], [33]. Recently,
[33] achieved EER as low as 1.3% using successive mouse
actions between clicks. The best accuracy has been reported in
[19] with a FAR of 0.36% and a FRR of 0%, although it has
been suspected that this result was inﬂuenced by recording the
data on a different computer for each user [15].
The work in [17] uses multi-modal biometrics composed
of voice, face, and signature data for authentication on mobile
phones. The goal is to enable legally binding contracts to be
signed. According to [17], the face veriﬁcation shows very high
Equal Error Rate (EER), around 28%, the EER of voice and
signature are around 5% and 8%, respectively. The fusion of
the three biometrics decreases the EER to 2%, yet the price to
be paid is the highly intrusive procedure where the user needs
to sign, read, and enter a PIN-based password. The work in
[7] is related to multi-modal biometrics. It investigates users’
touch screen gestures captured by their smart phones. The
study shows low error rates, e.g., EERs between 0% and 4%
when using SVM and k-NN classiﬁers. Although not in the
area of system security, the work in [11] describes a similar
approach based on Swept Frequency Capacitive Sensing, which
measures the impedance of a user to the environment across a
range of AC frequencies. Finally, a comprehensive survey on
multi-modal behavioral biometrics can be found in, e.g., [32].
[27] covers recent papers on biometrics based on the
electroencephalography (EEG), the electrocardiogram (ECG),
and the skin conductance, also called electro-dermal response
(EDR). Probably the most related to this paper is the work in
[5], where bioimpedance is used as a biometric. A wearable
sensor is designed to passively recognize wearers based on a
body’s unique response to the alternating current of different
frequencies. Experiments were conducted in a family-sized
setting of 2 to 5 subjects, where a person wears a bioimpedance
sensor on the wrist. They achieve recognition rate of 90%
when their impedance measurements are augmented with hand
geometry. Our biometric solves a different problem but it still
uses the body’s response to a signal. We achieve an achieve
recognition rate of 100% when samples are taken in one session
and 88% when samples are taken weeks apart. We also do not
require any augmentation.
Although not directly related to our work, it is interesting
to mention a cryptographic key generation scheme described
in [10]. It introduces a key generation resistant against co-
ercion attacks. The idea is to incorporate skin conductance
measurements into the cryptographic key generation. They
experimentally show that the skin conductance measurement
will help to reveal user’s emotional states and recognize the
attack as a stressful event (signiﬁcantly different from the state
when the keys were generated). This way, the generated keys
include a dynamic component that can detect whether a user
is forced to grant an access to the system.
IX. CONCLUSION
We have proposed a new biometric based on the human
body’s response to an electric square pulse signal. We used our
new pulse-response biometric as an additional authentication
mechanism in a PIN entry system, enhancing the security of the
PIN entry mechanism without adding additional inconvenience
for the user.
We also applied our new pulse-response biometric to the
problem of continuous authentication. We designed a continuous
authentication mechanism on a secure terminal, ensuring that
the user that started the session continued to be the person
physically at the keyboard.
We showed through experiments on our proof-of-concept
prototype system, that each human body exhibits a unique
response to a signal pulse applied at the palm of one hand,
and measured at the palm of the other. Using our prototype
setup we where able to identify users with high probability in
a matter of seconds. This identiﬁcation mechanism integrates
very well with other well established methods, e.g., PIN entry,
to produce a highly reliable additional layer of security, either
on a continuous basis or at login time.
