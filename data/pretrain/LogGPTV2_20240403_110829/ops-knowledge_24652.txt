User: I want to learn if is there any available wheel for Python 3.6 to create executable files. I know pyinstall cx_freeze and py2exe options. However, they are available for Python3.4 or 3.5 for the most uptaded. Is there any way to create .exe from Python 3.6 script?
Assistant: I have successfully used cx_freeze 5.0.1 with Python 3.6. Did you tried with older version or specific setup that failed ?
