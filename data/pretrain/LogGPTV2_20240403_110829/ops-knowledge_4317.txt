User:  How does Kubernetes perform service discovery and load balancing?
Assistant: Kubernetes uses service discovery and load balancing to manage applications and services within the cluster. This mechanism can help Kubernetes automatically route container services to available nodes to achieve load balancing, failover, and scaling of applications and services. The service discovery and load balancing of Kubernetes consists of the following three concepts: 1. Service: Service is an abstract concept in Kubernetes, which represents a group of actually running containers. Each service has a unique name and IP address through which all containers within the service can be accessed. 2. Endpoints: Endpoints is the network endpoint corresponding to the service, which contains the IP address and port number information of all containers in the service. Through Endpoints, Kubernetes can dynamically manage the state of containers, and perform traffic control, load balancing and service discovery. 3. Ingress: Ingress is an API object used to manage HTTP and HTTPS traffic within the cluster. It is a routing rule in Kubernetes, which can map different services to different domain names or paths. In Kubernetes, service discovery and load balancing can be achieved in the following ways: 1. ClusterIP: ClusterIP is the most basic service type, which exposes the service to the backend of the virtual IP address and provides a stable , The way to access the service internally. 2. NodePort: NodePort exposes the service to the IP address and port of each node, so that the service can be accessed through the IP address and port of the node. NodePort can be used not only for internal application access, but also for external public network access. 3. LoadBalancer: Through the load balancing mechanism of the cloud platform, LoadBalancer creates a load balancer (Load Balancer) outside the cluster that is responsible for distributing traffic from the Internet to services inside the cluster. 4. ExternalName: ExternalName provides a lightweight, service-independent way to access external services by resolving the name of the service to the specified DNS name. Through the above methods, Kubernetes can dynamically perform load balancing and flow requests to available containers to achieve high availability and scalability. At the same time, through Ingress and Service, services can be deployed and updated in an orderly manner, achieving zero downtime and rapid deployment.
