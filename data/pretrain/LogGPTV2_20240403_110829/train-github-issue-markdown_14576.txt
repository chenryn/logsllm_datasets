Hello Vue Lovers! :D
Today I realized that there is something I really miss in VueJS that I liked
in Angular2.
It's the ? operator. It's explained very good here:  
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html#!#safe-
navigation-operator
I give a quick example.  
Everybody knows this problem.
If I get a hero async and I want to display a subproperty like this:
    The null hero's name is {{ hero.address.street }}
.. and the hero is not yet loaded, I will get an error like this:
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of undefined.
    or
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'address' of street
Usually we have to make a
    v-if="hero && hero.address"
or something like that.
That's why in Angular2 they have the so-called "? operator"  
So you can do something like this:
    The null hero's name is {{ hero?.address?.street }}
So it will do the if statements for us in a really convenient way.
Is it possible to integrate something like this in VueJS?  
This would be amazing! :)
