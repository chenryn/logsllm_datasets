In my org, each team is creating ES index daily so the number of index grows
very quickly. Usually users are interested only in their 'team' data.
Currently, some users execute query using Kibana w/o specifying index and
field name(it takes _all'). Such queries at times, bring our cluster to halt/
crash etc. I would like queries to be restricted such that only well defined
queries can be executed on ES. A well defined query is a query which specifies
index and field name. I could not find a server level config param to enforce
such constraint on user queries. I posted question on ES forum but did not get
a clear answer.
This bug/ ER filed to have ES server level parameter such as to enforce user
defined queries to have index name and/ or field name specified.
