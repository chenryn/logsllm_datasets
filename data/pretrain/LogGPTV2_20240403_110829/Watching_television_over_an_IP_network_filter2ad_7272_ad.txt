Figure 9: Popularity of a channel across DSLAMs
4.4 Summary
In this section, we have characterized the distribution of
popularity of channels and studied the popularity evolution
over time. Despite the fact that at any given point of time
the popularity is highly skewed over a few channels, the set of
top popular channels change over time, making the system
highly dynamic. This may be explained by the fact that
some genres are more popular at particular time of the day
and that the audience base changes over time. We have also
found that though certain channels are popular at any given
time, the set of channels that are popular across regions and
DSLAMs is not always the same. We have in fact found
the variations up to 20% in the set of channels that people
are watching across diﬀerent regions or DSLAMs within the
country.
5. CHANNEL SURFING PROBABILITY
In this section, we analyze channel switching behaviors to
gain understanding of (a) what aﬀects channel changes (e.g.,
time of the day, program popularity), (b) how people ﬁnd
interesting programs to watch based on the sequence of chan-
nels they visit, and (c) how people join and leave a particular
channel.
5.1 Factors that affect channel changes
Table 1 shows that attention span of a user is typically genre-
dependent and ranges from 5 to 21 minutes; genre clearly
aﬀects the likelihood and frequency of channel changes. In
this section, we focus on other potential factors of channel
changes: the time of day and program popularity. For these
two factors, we calculate the probability that a given channel
change is due to surﬁng compared to viewing in order to
infer the user’s reason for channel switching. We call this
the surﬁng probability, Ps. Let J be a set of channel join
events during a given time interval. Then Ps is deﬁned as
follows:
|surﬁng events in J|
|surﬁng or viewing events in J| .
Ps =
(2)
A surﬁng probability Ps of 0 indicates that after the channel
change, the user will stay and view. While the probability
of 1 means that channel change of a user will be followed by
another channel change, indicating the user is surﬁng.
We ﬁrst investigate how the surﬁng probability relates
to the time of day. Figure 10(a) shows the minimum, the
median, the average, and the maximum values of surﬁng
probability for every 10 minutes of a month-long period.
The median and the average values range from 0.65 to 0.90.
The surﬁng probability decreases around 6-7AM, 3PM, and
9PM, which are the peak IPTV usage hours. In conjunction
with our ﬁnding on the reinforced popularity of top ranked
channels at peak times, the decrease in surﬁng probability at
these hours indicates that a larger pool of concurrent view-
ers are more predictable and stable in their viewing patterns.
The daily scheduled programs likely cause them to surf less
during peak usage hours. The lowest point of surﬁng prob-
ability comes earlier than 8AM in the morning. We assume
this phenomenon is related to long program length: three
top ranked channels had a 3-hour long program from 6AM
to 9AM. In contrast, we see increase in surﬁng probability in
late evening and midnight, when the most popular programs
are shorter in lengths (30 minutes to 1 hour) and when we
expect a lot of people ﬁnish up some activity and check out
what is on TV.
As a second potential factor, we investigate the inﬂuence
of program popularity on channel changes. We compare
the channel ranks and the surﬁng probability for every 10
minutes of a month period. Figure 10(b) shows the 10th
percentile, the median, the average, and the 90th percentile

(a) Zapping probability from channel x to channel y

Figure 11: The probability of switching from channel x to channel y based on aggregate user behaviors: (a)
channel change activities mostly reveal linear patterns; (b) viewing activities also reveal non-linear patterns
values of surﬁng probability against the program ranks. The
surﬁng probability drops by 20% for 10% of the most popu-
lar programs. This indicates that viewers are more likely to
stay tuned once they join a popular program. The correla-
tion between the surﬁng probability and the program ranks
is less obvious for medium to low ranked programs. For very
unpopular programs (ranks beyond 100), we see increase in
surﬁng probability. That is, users visiting unpopular chan-
nels are likely to switch channels immediately.
So far, we have used the viewing period of 1 minute to de-
marcate surﬁng instances from viewing instances. As given
in Equation (2), the surﬁng probability is sensitive to the
choice of viewing period. For validation, we repeated the
three types of analysis in this subsection over diﬀerent view-
ing periods: 10 seconds, 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 5 min-
utes. We consistently found the same correlation between
the surﬁng probability and the three potential factors.
5.2 Switching from one channel to another
With a TV remote control, people switch channels up and
down easily in a sequential fashion. We call such channel
changes linear.
In IPTV, people may choose a diﬀerent
change strategy because there are simply too many channels
and they can use an Electronic program guide (EPG). Using
EPG, viewers can browse the broadcasting schedule over-
layed on the screen and jump to arbitrary channels. Users
also can directly input channel numbers through their TV
remote controls and jump to any channel. The sequence of
channels a user visits in such manner no longer needs to be
sequential. We call the channel changes between a pair of
channels that are not sequentially numbered non-linear.
To understand the collective switching behaviors of all
users, we examine the linear and non-linear switching pat-
terns. Using a month-long trace, we calculate the normal-
ized average probability of channel changes between every
pair of channels and visualize them in Figure 11(a). While
the actual channel numbers range from 0 to 265, we remove
gaps between channel numbers and reassign them sequen-
tially in the matrix. A color pixel at (x, y) represents the
probability of channel switching from channel x in the hor-
izontal axis to channel y in the vertical axis. Darker pixel
reﬂects higher probability. Since most channel changes are
concentrated on a few pairs of channels, we use the log value
of the probability to visualize both frequent and infrequent
events. Therefore, any slight diﬀerence in the brightness of
pixel is noteworthy.
We observe several interesting channel switching habits.
First, over 60% of channel changes are linear. The upward
linear switches (on line y = x + 1) account for 43% and the
downward linear switches (y = x − 1) account for 19%. Be-
cause channel changes happen between two diﬀerent chan-
nels, the switching probability on line y = x is zero. Sec-
ond, certain genres show a distinctive pattern of non-linear
channel changes within the genre, e.g., free, sports, and
kids. This reﬂects that users are interested in the set of
channels of similar topic. For example, a user tuning into
one sports channel is likely to check out other sports chan-
nels, compared to movies or documentaries. In total, 76%
of channel changes are within the same genre group, where
58% of switches are linear and 18% non-linear.
Third, the pattern of linear channel changes continues
through the less popular channels like music, satellite,
and audio. This indicates that linear channel changes, even
with its inconvenience in IPTV compared to conventional
TV, remain a characteristic behavior of users. Finally, the
remaining 18% of channel changes are non-linear across dif-
ferent genres.
Next, we examine the inﬂuence of channel change pat-
terns on viewing. Using the same trace, Figure 11(b) visu-
alizes the probability of channel changes that led to viewing
events, from channel x in the horizontal axis to channel y
in the vertical axis. Intermediate surﬁng or away events are
excluded in the analysis. We note that the sequence of two
viewing events may not be relevant if they are separated by

(a) User arrival rate of channel A
(b) User departure rate of channel A
Figure 13: User arrival and departure evolution of the most popular free channel
away events. The results in this section were consistent even
when we ignore viewing events separated by away events.
As in Figure 11(a), a darker color represents logarithmically
higher viewing probability. Compared to Figure 11(a), one
striking diﬀerence is the consecutive viewing of the same
channel on line y = x, which now accounts for 17% of all
viewing instances. This reﬂects users’ tendency to return
to the same viewed channel for continued viewing, even af-
ter surﬁng. For example, viewers browse through other on-
going channels during commercials and rejoin the viewed
channel. This may lead to missing some part of the pro-
grams, especially when users re-join few minutes late after
the commercial break.
Another distinctive diﬀerence is the extent of non-linear
viewing. Non-linear viewing patterns account for 67% of
viewing instances, which is two times higher than that
of switching probability. Non-linear viewing is increased
for both inter-genre (40%) and intra-genre (27%) channel
changes. The total intra-genre viewing instances account for
60%, indicating that viewers are inclined to watch programs
of a similar topic. Within a given genre, some channels are
viewed much less than others. This is due to the popularity
diﬀerences of channels and the fact that some users are only
subscribing to some channels (e.g., basic, family, a la carte).
In summary, viewers tend to continue watching the same
channel even after switching for some time and with high
probability. This eﬀect is called “inheritance” and is a well-
established fact in traditional audience research (see [38], for
instance).
5.3 User arrival and departure patterns
To understand the dynamics of user churn in the system, we
analyze users’ arrival and departure patterns of individual
channels. We ﬁrst demonstrate the arrival and departure
rates for an example channel. We then investigate the inter-
arrival and inter-departure times to infer the distribution of
those processes.

5.3.1 Arrival and departure rates
Minute-by-minute user arrival and departure patterns
demonstrate how users join and leave a particular channel.
We discuss our ﬁndings on user arrival and departure pro-
cesses using an example channel A, a top ranked free chan-
nel. Figure 13 shows the arrival and departure rates of users
in channel A, over a representative day. The arrival and de-
parture rates are similar on average. However, the latter
ranges widely from 18 to 7,720 users per minute, while the
former ranges from 18 to 4,172.
We make several observations. First, the arrival and de-
parture rates vary over the day. A detailed analysis reveals
that the variation is related to the viewer base. Figure 12
shows the number of concurrent viewers who watched chan-
nel A for longer than 1 minute in every 10 minutes of the
day. The maximum values of user arrival and departure
rates in Figure 13 follow the viewer base well. Our ﬁnding
agrees with observation in other video systems [16, 33, 34].
Second, user departure patterns show consecutive spikes
as in Figure 13(b), where the departure rate suddenly in-
creases up to 5 times. These spikes are due to many users
leaving the channel simultaneously at the end of programs
or at advertisements. Hei et al. [34] also observed a batch
departure pattern in a P2P-based IPTV system for a pop-
ular movie channel. However, they did not ﬁnd such pat-
tern in regular TV channels. Our IPTV system show spikes
in departure patterns for popular channels across all gen-
res. The diﬀerence between genres is the interval between
spikes: cine channels had a gap of 2 hours, while other chan-
nels showed shorter intervals between spikes. Some of the
