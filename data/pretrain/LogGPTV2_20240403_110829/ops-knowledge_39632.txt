I am currently developing a webpage using Django on my PC, which runs Windows 7. I now need to test some pages on tablet PCs. I was wondering if it is possible to access my local development server (localhost) from an Android tablet. Both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network at home.

I have read several questions and answers on this topic on Stack Overflow and other forums, but I haven't found any concrete solutions yet.

I am using a Samsung Tab 2 10.1 with Android 4.0.4. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

If both your PC and Android tablet are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, you can indeed access your local development server (localhost) from the tablet. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Find Your PC's IP Address:**
   - Open Command Prompt on your Windows 7 PC.
   - Type `ipconfig` and press Enter.
   - Look for the IPv4 address under the section for your active network connection (e.g., Ethernet or Wi-Fi). It will look something like `192.168.x.x`.

2. **Configure Django to Allow External Access:**
   - By default, Django runs on `localhost` (127.0.0.1), which is only accessible from the same machine. To allow external access, you need to run the Django development server on all available IP addresses.
   - Use the following command in your terminal:
     ```sh
     python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
     ```
   - This will start the server on port 8000 and make it accessible from any device on your network.

3. **Access the Server from Your Tablet:**
   - On your Android tablet, open a web browser.
   - Enter the IP address of your PC followed by the port number (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:8000`).
   - You should now be able to see and interact with your Django application.

Make sure that there are no firewall or network settings blocking the connection. If you encounter any issues, double-check the IP address and ensure that both devices are on the same network.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
