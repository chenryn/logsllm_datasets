User: I am developing a webpage in django (on my pc with windows 7) and now i need to test some pages in tablet pcs. suddenly the thought came if i can have an access to my localhost in windows from android tablet. is that possible? I am in the same wifi connection in both devices at home. 
i read a lot questions and answers regarding this issue in stackoverflow and other places, but none of them gave me some concrete solutions. 
I have samsung tab 2 10.1 with android 4.0.4.
appreciate any help, thanks
Assistant: If both are connected to the same network, all you need to do is provide the IP address of your server (in your network) in your Android app.
