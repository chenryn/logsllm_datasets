**ATT&CK ID:** T1606.002  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SAML Tokens

An adversary who possesses a valid SAML token-signing certificate can forge SAML tokens with any desired permissions and lifetimes. By default, the validity period of a SAML token is one hour, but this can be adjusted by modifying the `NotOnOrAfter` value within the `<Conditions>` element of the token. Additionally, the `AccessTokenLifetime` in a `LifetimeTokenPolicy` can be used to change the token's validity period.

Forged SAML tokens allow adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as a single sign-on (SSO) mechanism, potentially granting them unauthorized access to multiple systems and resources.
