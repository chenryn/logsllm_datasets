### Title: Qualcomm WiFi: The Infinity War of Security

Qualcomm is the leading chip manufacturer in the smartphone market, with hundreds of millions of devices utilizing its WiFi chips. Any security vulnerability in these chips can have a significant impact on users. Among the various attack surfaces, zero-click remote or adjacent attacks are particularly concerning to security researchers. These types of attacks require no user interaction, making them highly stealthy and dangerous.

WiFi, as one of the most critical short-range communication protocols, is a prime target for attackers. In this presentation, we will delve into the security risks faced by Qualcomm WiFi and discuss the mitigations that can be implemented. We will illustrate these points using eight of the latest zero-click remote vulnerabilities that our team has discovered.

Despite the numerous improvements and security enhancements introduced in Qualcomm's flagship Snapdragon 865 in 2020, our in-depth security research has uncovered additional vulnerabilities in its WiFi module. During this talk, we will also share our methodologies for reverse engineering and exploiting WiFi vulnerabilities in the Snapdragon 865.
