User: Regarding Docker's container technology, please explain how to deploy and manage containerized applications, and introduce the basic commands and operating modes of Docker.
Assistant: Deploy and manage containerized applications: 1. Write a Dockerfile to define the environment and dependencies of the application. 2. Use the Dockerfile to build the image, and upload the image to the mirror warehouse. 3. Use Docker to install the runtime environment on the target server. 4. Pull the image from the mirror repository and run the container. Commonly used Docker commands: 1. docker pull: pull images from remote warehouses 2. docker build: use Dockerfile to build images 3. docker run: run containers 4. docker ps: view currently running containers 5. docker stop: stop containers 6. docker rm: delete the container 7. docker images: list all images 8. docker rmi: delete the image Docker operation mode: 1. Single process mode: run a process in the container. 2. Multi-process mode: Run multiple processes in the container to solve the deployment problem of complex applications. 3. Daemon mode: run a long-running process, such as a web service.
