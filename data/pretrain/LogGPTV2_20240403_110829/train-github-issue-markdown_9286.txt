The comments imply, to me, that specifying --cert-dir will cause the apiserver
to look in --cert-dir for some appopriately named certs and will use those.
This is in lieu of the user specifying --tls-cert-file and --tls-private-key
manually.
Two problems: one, the flag descriptions don't tell the user what the cert/key
need to be named for them to be auto-picked up. Two, the code doesn't actually
look for those files in the --cert-dir. It just clobbers them with
Kubernetes's own self-signed certificates.
Of course, it's also possible that I'm just misunderstanding the description
of --cert-dir. In that case, I think it would be clearer if --cert-dir said
"The directory where self-signed TLS certs are placed".
Relevant code: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cmd/kube-
apiserver/app/server.go#L621-L622
(note, util.GenerateSelfSignedCert says in a comment that it will replace any
existing certs)
