**What happened** :  
The controller-manager logs repeatedly show that it deleted orphaned pods
which belong to the static pods of kubelets which have "--register-node=false"
set:
    I1206 11:31:14.941598       1 gc_controller.go:184] Found orphaned Pod kube-controller-manager-master-1 assigned to the Node master-1. Deleting.
    I1206 11:31:14.941605       1 gc_controller.go:71] PodGC is force deleting Pod: kube-system:kube-controller-manager-master-1
    I1206 11:31:15.425141       1 gc_controller.go:188] Forced deletion of orphaned Pod kube-controller-manager-master-1 succeeded
The pods/containers are not really deleted. It looks like only the "mirror"
PODs are deleted and later readded. But I'm not sure about this as I did not
dig into mirror PODs that deep.
The POD status seems to be jumping from "Running" to "Pending" and back after
every few seconds.
**What you expected to happen** :  
I'd expect that the gc_controller would ignore static/mirror PODs in this
case. I'm not sure how GC should work here in case the source kubelet dies as
we don't have node status here.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
Run a kubelet with "--register-node=false" and add some static PODs/manifests.
kargo for example does this at the moment.
