### Keywords Searched
Before filing this issue, I searched for the following keywords in Kubernetes issues: "static pod orphaned" and "static pod register-node". If any duplicates were found, I would have replied there instead.

### Issue Type
- **Type of Issue:** BUG REPORT

### Kubernetes Version
- **Version:** v1.5.0-beta.2

### Environment
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration:** Azure
- **Operating System (e.g., from /etc/os-release):** CentOS 7
- **Kernel (e.g., `uname -a`):** 
  ```
  Linux master-1 4.8.11-1.el7.elrepo.x86_64 #1 SMP Sat Nov 26 11:13:42 EST 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  ```
- **Installation Tools:** kargo (+custom changes)

### Description
The controller-manager logs indicate that it repeatedly deletes orphaned pods belonging to static pods of kubelets with the `--register-node=false` flag set. Here are some log entries:

```
I1206 11:31:14.941598       1 gc_controller.go:184] Found orphaned Pod kube-controller-manager-master-1 assigned to the Node master-1. Deleting.
I1206 11:31:14.941605       1 gc_controller.go:71] PodGC is force deleting Pod: kube-system:kube-controller-manager-master-1
I1206 11:31:15.425141       1 gc_controller.go:188] Forced deletion of orphaned Pod kube-controller-manager-master-1 succeeded
```

Despite these deletions, the pods/containers are not actually removed. It appears that only the "mirror" pods are being deleted and then re-added. The pod status alternates between "Running" and "Pending" every few seconds.

### Expected Behavior
I expect the garbage collector (gc_controller) to ignore static/mirror pods in this scenario. It is unclear how the garbage collector should handle such cases when the source kubelet dies, as we do not have node status information.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run a kubelet with the `--register-node=false` flag.
2. Add some static pods/manifests.
   - For example, kargo currently does this.

### Additional Information
- None at this time.
