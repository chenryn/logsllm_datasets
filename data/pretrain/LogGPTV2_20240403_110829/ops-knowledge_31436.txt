Assistant: At 17-06-09 20:10:57, two tasks (1128 and 1129) were assigned and began running. The BlockManager found five blocks (rdd_11_0-4) locally. The FileOutputCommitter algorithm version was set to 1. The PythonRunner reported total, boot, init, and finish times for each task. Finally, the output of task 1129 was saved to a HDFS location.
