where p(v,a) is the number of equally preferred paths
from CA v to false origin a and p(v,t) is the number of
equally preferred paths from CA v to victim domain t.
We perform the path inference based on (1) local pref-
erence of customer routes over peer routes over provider
routes and (2) shortest AS path as outlined by Gao et
al. [21].
Then, for a given CA v and victim domain t, we will
consider all other ASes as possible attackers a and aggre-
gate the above values to obtain a resilience for pair (v,t).
We computed such resilience values for all pairs of the
top ten CAs and the 12992 victim domain ASes in our
dataset using the AS topology published by CAIDA in
October of 2017.
Resilince is largely determined by AS interconnectiv-
ity. ASes with a larger number of neighbors tend to have
higher resiliences (especially if these neighbors are tier 1
providers) because they are closer to other parts of the In-
ternet, which makes their route more preferable. AS size
(as measured by infrastructure or geographic area cov-
ered) does not directly inﬂuence resilience but is corre-
lated, because large ASes are more likely to have a larger
number of neighbors.
4.3.1 Resilience of Domains
Figure 5 shows the average resilience of the domains av-
eraged over the top ten CAs. We can see that 50% of the
domains have resilience values lower than 57%, mean-
ing that if an adversary selects a random CA to issue a
certiﬁcate for these victim domains, there would be at
least 43% probability that the adversary would be able
to launch an equally-speciﬁc-preﬁx hijack and obtain the
bogus certiﬁcate from that CA.

leading CAs. In this section, we present two countermea-
sures that can be deployed by CAs to mitigate these at-
tacks: multiple vantage point veriﬁcation and BGP mon-
itoring system.
To test the effectiveness of these countermeasures, we
developed our own implementation of both countermea-
sures in the Let’s Encrypt code base and relaunched the
attacks in an attempt to fool our modiﬁed CA. We found
that our defenses are effective in mitigating the attacks
discussed in this paper.
5.1 Multiple Vantage Point Veriﬁcation
As discussed in Section 2.2, equally-speciﬁc-preﬁx at-
tacks and AS-path poisoning attacks do not affect the
whole Internet. The former affects only a local network
and the later does not affect the on-path ASes from the
adversary to the CA. In other words, while the attack suc-
cessfully captures trafﬁc from the CA, it will not capture
trafﬁc from other parts of the Internet. Thus, it is impor-
tant for CAs to perform domain control veriﬁcation from
a global perspective by repeating the veriﬁcation from
multiple vantage points.7
We propose a multiple vantage point veriﬁcation
method that can be deployed by CAs (with a similar mo-
tivation to the Perspectives [47] and Double Check [12]
systems for trust-on-ﬁrst-use protocols). The CAs will
establish multiple vantage points in several different
ASes. During the domain veriﬁcation process, CAs
will perform domain veriﬁcation from all these vantage
points. Our proposal in this section focuses on the HTTP
veriﬁcation method. We provide an adapted proposal on
the Email veriﬁcation method in Appendix B.
5.1.1 Vantage Point Selection
Given limited resources available for deploying vantage
points, we need to strategically select the vantage points
to maximize the security. Two distinct factors contribute
to the quality of a set of vantage points:
1. The uneven distribution of domains. As shown in
Table 5, ﬁve ASes host nearly 50% of all the do-
mains in our dataset. Vantage points that are topo-
logically closer to these ASes are preferable to more
distant vantage points.
2. Vantage point diversity. Vantage point sets that are
more spread out across the Internet topology are
staging environment. We will discuss their deployment and our recom-
mendations.
7Note that the multiple vantage point veriﬁcation is effective against
attacks that do not have a global effect. To defend against attacks that
have a global effect (e.g., traditional sub-preﬁx attacks), we propose a
BGP monitoring system in Section 5.2.
Figure 5: Average resilience and effective resilience of
victim domains considering the top ten CAs.
Furthermore, an adversary can choose a target CA to
exploit as opposed to choosing a random CA to increase
the probability of success. Thus, we also compute the ef-
fective resilience of the domains by taking the minimum
resilience value from the top ten CAs, also shown in Fig-
ure 5. We can see that the effective resilience is a lot
lower than the average resilience. 50% of the domains
have resilience values lower than 30%, meaning that if
an adversary targets one of the ten CAs to issue a cer-
tiﬁcate for these victim domains, there would be at least
70% probability that the adversary would succeed. Note
that there are many more CAs than the top ten CAs we
considered in our dataset, so considering a larger set of
CAs could further lower the effective resilience.
4.3.2 Resilience of CAs
Similarly, we compute the average resilience of CAs by
averaging over all victim domains. We show the average
resilience in the last row in Table 4 for the ﬁve CAs that
we attacked in Section 2.
There is high variation among the resiliences of CAs.
Let’s Encrypt’s resilience is very high (.887) because it
has four direct tier 1 providers and is one hop away from
much of the Internet, so its announcement will likely be
preferred over the adversary’s announcement. On the ﬂip
side, Comodo has a very low resilience (0.217) because
it has only one direct tier 1 provider. This makes the path
longer for Comodo to reach the rest of the Internet and
likely less preferred over an adversary’s announcement.
5 Countermeasures for CAs
At the time we performed our attacks, no CAs we studied
had any countermeasures in place to prevent BGP attacks
from acquiring bogus TLS certiﬁcates.6 As a result, all

more difﬁcult to attack with a single localized rout-
ing announcement.
With these criteria in mind, we designed an algorithm
to select preferred vantage points for a given CA. The al-
gorithm requires a set of customer domains (in our case,
domains from our dataset of certiﬁcates), and a list of
candidate vantage points (e.g., data centers where the CA
can potentially deploy vantage points). Fundamentally,
the algorithm attempts to ﬁnd a set of vantage points with
the maximum resilience as a set. We calculate the re-
silience for a set as following. We ﬁrst compute the re-
silience of each sample domain from each vantage point
in the set, as explained in Section 4.3. Then, we take the
maximum resilience of each domain from the previous
step. We then average the maximum resiliences over all
domains to obtain the resilience for the set.8
Next, our algorithm has three nested steps:
1. Vantage Point Set Improvement: The algorithm be-
gins with an initial set of randomly-selected van-
tage points from the list of candidate vantage points.
Then, for each vantage point in the set, the algo-
rithm substitutes that vantage point with the poten-
tial vantage point (chosen from the list of candidate
vantage points) that causes the set of vantage points
to have the greatest resilience increase.
2. Finding a Local Maximum: The process of vantage
point set improvement is repeated until the set of
vantage points can no longer be improved. We refer
to this set of vantage points as a local maximum.
3. Using Randomization to ﬁnd a Global Maximum:
Given a set of candidate vantage points, there ex-
ist several local maximum of which only one is a
global maximum (i.e., the optimal set of vantage
8This calculation is actually a lower bound on the true resilience of
a set of vantage points as an adversary must fool all vantage points in
the set and not just the vantage point closest to the domain. However,
computing the true resilience for all sets of vantage points is computa-
tionally infeasible.
points). To increase the likelihood of ﬁnding a
global maximum, our algorithm repeats the above
steps with random initial vantage points to ﬁnd as
many local maximum as possible.
We found that there is a roughly 18% chance that a
local maximum found by the script will be the global
maximum we eventually found (when considering a set
of ﬁve vantage points chosen from 1,000 candidate van-
tage points). Thus, the above algorithm can ﬁnd global
maximums with a reasonable number of repetitions.
This algorithm can also let CAs ﬁnd out how best to
expand while utilizing existing infrastructure. To com-
pute additional vantage points given a set of already de-
ployed vantage points, we simply consider certain van-
tage points in the candidate set to be ﬁxed (e.g., CA’s
existing vantage points such as its own data center) and
we do not consider alternatives to these vantage points.
5.1.2 Vantage Point Evaluation
Figure 6: Resilience for Let’s Encrypt with varying num-
bers of vantage points.
We evaluate resilience for Let’s Encrypt with different
numbers of vantage points, shown in Figure 6. The base-
line is 1 Vantage Point, where the CA only performs do-
main control veriﬁcation from its own existing AS/data
center without any additional vantage points (in Let’s En-
crypt’s case, the ViaWest data center AS 13649 is the
ﬁxed vantage point). This gives an average resilience
of domains of 61%, meaning an attack will have a 39%
chance of success. When the number of vantage points is
more than one, the adversary must hijack trafﬁc from all
of the vantage points to deceive the CA. This greatly re-
duces the chance of success for the attacker. Note that
this evaluation considers the domains as the target of
BGP attacks, whereas resiliences shown Table 4 consid-
ers the CAs as the target.
We can see that, with only one additional vantage
point (two vantage points in total), there is already a
24% increase over the baseline (to an average resilience
of 85%). With three vantage points, the resilience is at

only has 10% probability to succeed (a 28% improve-
ment over the baseline).
5.1.3 Let’s Encrypt’s Deployment
Our work was a key factor in Let’s Encrypt’s preliminary
deployment of multiple vantage points in their staging
environment, which is used for testing features before
full release in the production environment [37]. Here we
present a discussion of the current staging environment
implementation and some of the changes Let’s Encrypt
is making in the full release.
Vantage point location. Based on our measurements
in Let’s Encrypt’s staging environment [6], Let’s En-
crypt deployed two remote vantage points in addition to
their original data center in AS 13649 (ViaWest). The
two vantage points were located in Amazon data centers
in Ohio and Frankfurt. Although these vantage points
have a broad geographic distribution, they are not sufﬁ-
ciently diverse in terms of network topology. Both van-
tage points are run by Amazon and both belong to the
same AS 16509, which are likely to have similar BGP
routes. Thus, in the full release, the Let’s Encrypt team
plans to improve AS-level diversity by deploying more
vantage points in distinct ASes located in different parts
of the Internet topology.
Handling anomaly. Let’s Encrypt’s staging envi-
ronment deployment permits one of the remote vantage
points (although not the original data center) to time out,
which allows for network/hardware failures and main-
tains a low false positive rate. However, this also weak-
ens the security guarantee of the system. If one vantage
point is allowed to time out, then the system will miss
out on the routing information from that vantage point.
Furthermore, strategic attackers can target vantage points
that may be able to observe the attack, and launch DoS
attacks against the target to make it time out.
Given the tradeoff between a strong security guarantee
and false positives in the event of a network failure, we
propose that (1) there be a limit on the total number of
vantage points allowed to time out, and (2) at least one
vantage point in each AS where vantage points are de-
ployed be required to send a response. We recommend
this method in order to tolerate failure while still provid-
ing strong security.
5.2 Monitoring BGP Route Age
We present a new BGP monitoring system that is specif-
ically tailored for deployment by CAs with a novel route
age detection heuristic.
Traditional general purpose BGP monitoring systems
attempt to maintain a low false positive. However, some
seemingly innocent BGP route updates that would nor-
mally not be labeled suspicious can be used to target the
PKI. For example, the announcement of a single preﬁx
