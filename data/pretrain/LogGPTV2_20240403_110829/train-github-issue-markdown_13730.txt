Rust's configure script contains 4 years of accumulated knowledge, mostly
around command line parsing and platform detection. We've copied parts of this
script to Cargo's configure script, install.sh and rustup.sh. It would be nice
to not duplicate this logic since the implementation of each drifts over time.
