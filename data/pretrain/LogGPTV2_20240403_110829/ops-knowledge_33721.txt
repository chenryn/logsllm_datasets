**Question:**
I have a Windows Server 2008 Enterprise VPS that I have configured to connect to my home VPN server. I can successfully establish the connection, but it disconnects when I log out from the Remote Desktop Connection (RDC).

Is there a way to configure the server to maintain the VPN connection even after I log out from RDC?

**Answer:**
To achieve an always-on VPN connection, you can set up a persistent demand-dial connection using the Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS). This configuration will ensure that the VPN connection remains active, even if you log out from the Remote Desktop Connection.

Here are the steps to configure a persistent demand-dial connection:

1. **Open Routing and Remote Access:**
   - Go to `Start` > `Administrative Tools` > `Routing and Remote Access`.

2. **Enable RRAS:**
   - If RRAS is not already enabled, right-click on the server name in the left pane and select `Configure and Enable Routing and Remote Access`.

3. **Create a Demand-Dial Interface:**
   - In the RRAS console, right-click on `Demand-Dial Interfaces` and select `New Demand-Dial Interface`.
   - Follow the wizard to create a new interface, providing the necessary details such as the remote access server's IP address or FQDN, and the credentials for the connection.

4. **Configure the Demand-Dial Interface:**
   - Right-click on the newly created demand-dial interface and select `Properties`.
   - On the `General` tab, check the box for `Persistent connection`.
   - Configure other settings as needed, such as the dial-out hours and redial attempts.

5. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Connect to the demand-dial interface and verify that it remains connected even after logging out from the Remote Desktop Connection.

By following these steps, you should be able to maintain a persistent and always-on VPN connection on your Windows Server 2008 VPS.
