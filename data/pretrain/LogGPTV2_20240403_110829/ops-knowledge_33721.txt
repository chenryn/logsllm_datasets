User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server 2008 With VPN Client Always On I have a Windows Server 2008 Ent VPS that I have setup to connect to my hone VPN server. I'm able to get connected to the VPN but it disconnects me when I logout.

Is there a way I can setup the server to keep the VPN Connection alive even when I log out from RDC?

Assistant: Have a look at persistent demand-dial connections in Routing and Remote Access Service. That'll do what you want to do re: an always-on VPN connection.
