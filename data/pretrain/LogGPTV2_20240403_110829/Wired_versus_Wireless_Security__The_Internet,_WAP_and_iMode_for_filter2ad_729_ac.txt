### SSL Sessions and Certificate Management

- **Server-Side SSL Session:** In a server-side SSL session, the server presents a digital certificate to the user's browser to verify its identity. This certificate binds the public key with the server's name, ensuring that the user is communicating with the intended server.
  
- **Mutually Authenticated SSL Session:** A mutually authenticated SSL session involves both the user's browser and the server presenting digital certificates to each other. This ensures that both parties can verify the authenticity of their identities, as the certificates bind the public keys to the respective names.

- **Common Usage:** Most back-end systems require at least a server-side SSL session, which is easier to establish since it does not require the user to obtain a certificate. However, it is anticipated that in the future, more systems will require users to present a certificate for mutually authenticated SSL sessions.

- **User Certificate Management:** Users must obtain a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA), such as VeriSign. This certificate is stored in the browser's certificate store, and the browser manages the certificate. To establish a mutually authenticated SSL session, the user must enter a password to unlock the certificate store and access the certificate. This type of certificate is often referred to as an "authentication certificate" because it contains the key-name binding used for authentication purposes. It is recommended that users have separate signing and authentication keys.

- **Certificate Management and Distribution:** The management and distribution of certificates in the Internet world are beyond the scope of this paper. For more information, refer to [3].

### WAP Security

WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) includes several security features:

- **WTLS Protocol:** WTLS (Wireless Transport Layer Security) is used to secure WAP communications, providing entity authentication, data confidentiality, and data integrity. It is based on the IETF SSL/TLS protocols and is used to secure communications between the WAP device and the WAP Gateway. There are three classes of WTLS:
  - **Class 1:** Uses unauthenticated Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish the session key.
  - **Class 2:** Enforces server-side public key authentication using certificates similar to those in the SSL/TLS protocol. The WAP Gateway uses a WTLS certificate, which is a compressed form of an X.509 certificate.
  - **Class 3:** Allows clients to authenticate using client-side certificates in regular X.509 format. These certificates can be stored on the client or on a publicly accessible server.

- **WAP Identity Module (WIM):** New generation WAP phones include a WIM, which facilitates client-side authentication and implements WTLS Class 3 functionality. The WIM supports public key cryptography, with RSA being mandatory and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) optional. The WIM is configured with two sets of private-public key pairs (one for signing and one for authentication) and two manufacturer’s certificates. The WIM can also store a limited number of user certificates or references, such as URL-based references. Users must enroll or register a certificate at each Enterprise, binding their public key with the local Enterprise name.

- **Tamper-Resistance:** WIMs are required to be tamper-resistant, meaning they use physical hardware protection to prevent the extraction or modification of information, especially the user’s private keys, which never leave the WIM.

### iMode Security

- **Overview:** Information about iMode security is limited due to its proprietary nature. However, it is known that iMode uses standard Internet protocols like HTTP and SSL/TLS end-to-end, introduced in March 2001. Lower-level protocols are proprietary NTT DoCoMo protocols.

- **Security Issues:** A list of frequently asked questions (FAQ) by Eurotechnology identifies five security issues with iMode, including the security of the radio link, the transparent public Internet connection, private networks, and password security. With the adoption of SSL, some of these issues, particularly those related to the radio link and public Internet connection, are now addressed.

- **SSL Adoption:** iMode recently adopted SSL, providing end-to-end security within the entire mobile network. iMode phones are pre-configured with root CA keys from PKI vendors Baltimore and VeriSign, allowing for server-side authenticated SSL sessions. However, iMode does not yet support client-side certificates, which means non-repudiation is not possible.

- **Downloadable Applications:** iMode allows users to download Java applications, managed by the Java Application Manager (JAM). Java applets cannot control the JAM, launch new applets, or access traditional handset resources, providing a sandboxed environment for downloaded applications.

### Wired and Wireless Security Services

- **User Identification and Authentication:** In the wired world, common forms of user identification and authentication include username and password, token-based authentication, and digital certificates. WAP supports different types of authentication depending on the class of WTLS service. WTLS Class 3 allows for client-side identification and authentication using a public/private key pair hardcoded on the WIM card and bound with the user’s name in their certificate.

- **iMode Authentication:** User authentication in iMode follows the same processes as on the Internet, with HTTP Basic Authentication supported. However, the specific details of iMode's authentication mechanisms are not fully clear.
