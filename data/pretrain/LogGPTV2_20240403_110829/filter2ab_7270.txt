title:botconf2022 A fresh look into the underground card shop ecosystem
Law enforcement has seized multiple card shops during recent years. However, every time there is a gap in the card shop business due to law enforcement countermeasures, exit scam from the market operators, or simply closure, new threat actors come into the space to fill the gap. This presentation will focus on our investigations on the current card shop ecosystem, from active shops that could grow in the vacuum left by Joker’s Stash’s withdrawal as well as other recently shuttered card shops. We will provide insights on some of the most relevant underground card shops nowadays, which types of products are offered, their prices, and related threat actors and business models. After this talk, the audience will have a clear idea of the current status of the underground card shop ecosystem.
