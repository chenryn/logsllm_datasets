### Title: Botconf2022 - A Fresh Look into the Underground Card Shop Ecosystem

In recent years, law enforcement agencies have seized multiple card shops. However, whenever there is a gap in the market due to law enforcement actions, exit scams by market operators, or simple closures, new threat actors quickly emerge to fill the void. This presentation will delve into our investigations of the current card shop ecosystem, focusing on active shops that have gained prominence following the withdrawal of Jokerâ€™s Stash and other recently shuttered card shops.

We will provide detailed insights into some of the most significant underground card shops today, including the types of products they offer, their pricing structures, and the associated threat actors and business models. By the end of this talk, the audience will have a clear understanding of the current state of the underground card shop ecosystem.
