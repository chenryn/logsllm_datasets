User: I created a virtualenv around my project, but when I try to activate it I cannot.
It might just be syntax or folder location, but I am stumped right now.
You can see below, I create the virtualenv and call it venv. Everything looks good, then I try to activate it by running source venv/bin/activate
I'm thinking it might just have to do with my system path, but not sure what to point it to (I do know how to edit the path). I'm on python 7 / windows os, virtual env 2.2.x

Assistant: If you’re using Windows, use the command "venv\Scripts\activate" (without the word source) to activate the virtual environment. If you’re using PowerShell, you might need to capitalize Activate.
