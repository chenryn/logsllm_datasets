From the documentation on Full-width vs Centered, both example look pretty
much the same (except for different column size for child items but I don't
think that's what "full-width" and "centered" are about, correct me if I'm
wrong).
AFAIK, full-width & centered are equivalent of Bootstrap's `container-fluid`
and `container`, right?
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
  * Examples should look significantly different between Full-Width and Centered (see Bootstrap)
  * Documentation should specify which part of the code is responsible for full-width and centered
## Current Behavior
  * I don't think the example is correct
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  * Just copy the code for Centered Grid from https://material-ui.com/layout/grid/#full-width-vs-centered on to your project, you don't see any effects that would be considered "centered"
## Context
  * Just got confused by the documentation. I think the examples need to be updated.
