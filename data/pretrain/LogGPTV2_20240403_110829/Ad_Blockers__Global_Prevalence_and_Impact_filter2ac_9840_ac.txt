Table 3: The percent of users with an ad blocker installed by pub-
lisher segment.
with an ad blocker installed can be markedly different from
site to site. To quantify this behavior and it’s associated im-
pact, we calculate the percentage of users with an ad blocker
installed across (i) ten publishers and (ii) the major publisher
segments. The ten publishers are a random selection of those
with large audiences that illustrate the scope of impact of ad
blockers. Publisher names have been removed to preserve
anonymity.
Table 2 provides the results for ten publishers. The per-
centage of users with an ad blocker installed ranges from
25.27% for Publisher H to 17.95% for Publisher B. Note,
Publishers A, B, D, E, and F appear in some form on Ad-
block Plus’s whitelist while Publishers C, G, H, I do not.
To further elucidate user ad block install behavior, we
ran the same analysis across publisher segments. The re-

Table 2: Publisher breakout. Publisher names have been anonymized. The table shows the percent of ad block users and the percentage of ad
requests blocked. AVads and AVads are the number of ads shown per page view to ad block users and non-users. The ad blocker exposure
rate is the number of ads delivered to an ad block user per ad delivered to a non-blocker. Lastly, estimated potential revenue lost due to ad
block usage is shown.
sults of this analysis are shown in Table 3. The percentage
of users with an ad blocker installed are highest on XXX
Adult (24.74%) and lowest on Portals (17.77%). Notably,
ad blocker install rates among users visiting Sports, Tech-
nology, Entertainment, and News/Information segments is
quite similar. These segments represent sites where users
consume various forms of media and are therefore likely to
be confronted with advertisements that disrupt the consump-
tion of this media.
4.5 Ad Blocker Impact Analysis
It is clear from the previous subsection that a signiﬁcant
proportion of users employ ad blockers. However, only con-
sidering users ignores two important factors: (i) ad block
users (could) still be exposed to a signiﬁcant number of ads
due to whitelisting and disabling and (ii) different classes of
users have different browsing behaviors.
To capture these effects, we considered the ad blocker ex-
posure rate, which is interpreted as the number of ads shown
to an ad block user per ad shown to a non-block user. Table
3 and Table 2 show the ad blocker exposure rate, computed
as AVblock/AVads, where AVblock and AVad are the number
of ads per page view shown to ad block users and non-users.
Additionally, we calculated the percentage of ad requests
blocked and the potential revenue lost for ten publishers.
The revenue lost assumes a modest $1 CPM (cost per thou-
sand ads shown, selected arbitrarily). The calculation of the
ad requests blocked is outlined here:
1. compute X, the percentage of ad block users, as panel
percent ad block on publisher A multiplied by the MPE
projection factor for the geo of interest
2. multiply X by the total number of users on publisher
A, which gives an estimate of the number of ad block
users on publisher A, denoted Y
3. from panel data, compute the average page views per
ad block user for publisher A, and multiply by Y to get
Z, the number of page views from ad block users on
publisher A
4. from panel data, compute the average number of ads
shown per page view to ad block users (AVblock) and
the average number of ads shown per page view to non-
block users (AVad)

Table 4: Ad blocker exposure rate. The ad blocker exposure rate is
the number of ads delivered to an ad block user per ad delivered to
a non-ad block user.
5. compute blocked impressions as Z×(AVads−AVblock)
The potential revenue lost Rlost using a $1 CPM (cost per
thousand ads shown, selected arbitrarily) for the ten publish-
ers is found in Table 2. The intermediary values for AVad
and AVblock are also found in Table 2. Even with a modest
$1 CPM, it is clear that ad blockers have a signiﬁcant impact
on revenue lost for publishers (e.g., $3.9M/mo. for Publisher
C to $120K/mo. for Publisher I).
5. RELATED WORK
A study of general aspects of the ad serving ecosystem
is reported in [2]. That paper highlights the impact of user-
targeting in online advertising as well as the broad range of
ads that are delivered to different types of publishers. Nath
presents a similar study, which is focused on advertising
in the mobile app space [4]. More speciﬁc to ad block-
ers, Walls et al. [9] provide a comprehensive analysis of
Adblock Plus’s Acceptable Ads (i.e., whitelisting) program.
This study directly informs our work with respect to the issue
of whitelisting by ad blockers. In one of the few academic
studies on the topic, Pujol et al. [7] use passive measure-
ments on a residential broadband network to infer ad block
users and classify the impact of ad blockers on HTTP traf-
ﬁc. Our work is based on different datasets and employs
different methods to infer ad blocker use. Recently, Post
and Sekharan investigated the capabilities of 3 popular ad
blocker via source code analysis [6]. Finally, there continue
to be many reports in the popular press on ad blocker preva-
lence. Most of these are based on data provided (e.g., [3])
by entities that work with publishers to deploy a page-based
detector. Our work provides a complementary perspective
based on instrumentation deployed widely throughout the
internet.
6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we used two unique data sets to estimate the
prevalence and impact of ad blockers in the internet. We use
mixture proportion estimation to remove bias from a world-
wide user panel that provides ground truth on ad blocker in-
stalls.
Our results show that in the US, 18% of users have ad
blockers installed; up to 37% of users have ad blockers in-
stalled in other key geographies. Males 18-34 are the most
likely users of ad blockers in all geographies studied, with
49% using ad blocking software in Germany. Users with the
highest income levels are the most likely users of ad block-
ers in all geographies studied. Results show that Adblock
Plus is the most widely used ad blocker. Ad blockers are
most prevalent on Chrome, followed by Firefox. Users with
ad blockers see roughly half as many ads that users without
ad blockers see. Estimated monthly revenue lost due to ad
blockers on 10 large publisher sites varies between $3.9M
and $120K (assumes $1 CPM).
While the the results in this paper help further the under-
standing of ad block prevalence and impact, we would be re-
miss to not mention two inherent limitations. First, internet-
wide population or behavior estimation can never be shown
to be completely accurate due to scale, complexity and dy-
namics. However, we argue that our methodology that in-
cludes conﬁdence ranges, enables results to be more effec-
tively judged and interpreted. Second, our reliance on pro-
prietary datasets by deﬁnition limits the repeatability of our
experiments. In future work, we intend to address these lim-
itations by continuing to reﬁne our analytic capabilities, and
to consider how ad blocker prevalence might be measured in
a way that does not rely on proprietary data.
