The percentage of users with an ad blocker installed can vary significantly from site to site. To quantify this behavior and its associated impact, we calculated the percentage of users with an ad blocker installed across (i) ten publishers and (ii) major publisher segments. The ten publishers were randomly selected from those with large audiences to illustrate the scope of the impact of ad blockers. Publisher names have been anonymized to preserve anonymity.

Table 2 shows the percentage of ad block users and the percentage of ad requests blocked for each publisher. AVads and AVblock represent the number of ads shown per page view to ad block users and non-users, respectively. The ad blocker exposure rate is the number of ads delivered to an ad block user per ad delivered to a non-blocker. Lastly, the estimated potential revenue lost due to ad block usage is provided, assuming a modest $1 CPM (cost per thousand ads shown).

## Ad Blocker Impact Analysis

A significant proportion of users employ ad blockers. However, considering only the users who have ad blockers installed ignores two important factors: (i) ad block users may still be exposed to a significant number of ads due to whitelisting and disabling, and (ii) different classes of users have different browsing behaviors.

To capture these effects, we considered the ad blocker exposure rate, which is the number of ads shown to an ad block user per ad shown to a non-block user. The ad blocker exposure rate is computed as AVblock/AVads, where AVblock and AVad are the number of ads per page view shown to ad block users and non-users, respectively.

Additionally, we calculated the percentage of ad requests blocked and the potential revenue lost for ten publishers. The revenue lost assumes a modest $1 CPM (cost per thousand ads shown, selected arbitrarily). The calculation of the ad requests blocked is as follows:

1. Compute X, the percentage of ad block users, as the panel percent ad block on the publisher multiplied by the MPE projection factor for the relevant geography.
2. Multiply X by the total number of users on the publisher, which gives an estimate of the number of ad block users, denoted Y.
3. From panel data, compute the average page views per ad block user for the publisher, and multiply by Y to get Z, the number of page views from ad block users.
4. From panel data, compute the average number of ads shown per page view to ad block users (AVblock) and the average number of ads shown per page view to non-block users (AVad).
5. Compute blocked impressions as Z × (AVads − AVblock).

The potential revenue lost using a $1 CPM for the ten publishers is found in Table 2. Even with a modest $1 CPM, it is clear that ad blockers have a significant impact on revenue lost for publishers (e.g., $3.9M/mo. for Publisher C to $120K/mo. for Publisher I).

## Summary and Conclusions

In this paper, we used two unique datasets to estimate the prevalence and impact of ad blockers on the internet. We employed mixture proportion estimation to remove bias from a worldwide user panel that provides ground truth on ad blocker installs.

Our results show that in the US, 18% of users have ad blockers installed, with up to 37% of users having ad blockers installed in other key geographies. Males aged 18-34 are the most likely users of ad blockers, with 49% using ad blocking software in Germany. Users with the highest income levels are also the most likely users of ad blockers. Adblock Plus is the most widely used ad blocker, and ad blockers are most prevalent on Chrome, followed by Firefox. Users with ad blockers see roughly half as many ads as users without ad blockers. Estimated monthly revenue lost due to ad blockers on ten large publisher sites varies between $3.9M and $120K, assuming a $1 CPM.

While our results help further the understanding of ad block prevalence and impact, there are inherent limitations. Internet-wide population or behavior estimation can never be completely accurate due to scale, complexity, and dynamics. Our methodology, which includes confidence ranges, enables results to be more effectively judged and interpreted. Additionally, our reliance on proprietary datasets limits the repeatability of our experiments. In future work, we intend to address these limitations by refining our analytic capabilities and exploring methods to measure ad blocker prevalence without relying on proprietary data.
