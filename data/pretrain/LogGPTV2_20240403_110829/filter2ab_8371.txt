**ATT&CK ID:** M1042  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Disable or Remove Feature or Program

**Recommendation:**
Consider disabling the auto-mounting of disk image files (e.g., .iso, .img, .vhd, and .vhdx). This can be achieved by modifying the Windows Registry values associated with file type handling in Windows Explorer. Specifically, you should adjust the settings to prevent the automatic "Mount and Burn" dialog from appearing for these file extensions.

**Important Note:**
Disabling the auto-mounting feature will not completely remove the ability to mount these file types; it will only prevent the automatic prompt. Users will still be able to manually mount the disk images if needed.
