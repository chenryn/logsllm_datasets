Question: "As a security consultant, you are tasked with strengthening an organization's defenses against account enumeration attacks. Which of the following mitigation strategies would be least effective in preventing adversaries from discovering valid user accounts, and why?"
 "A": "Disabling the enumeration of administrator accounts through Group Policy settings, as it does not address the use of other built-in commands by adversaries."
 "B": "Monitoring command execution history for cloud API calls used for account discovery, as it may be circumvented by direct file system access."
 "C": "Restricting access to file resources that contain local accounts and group information, as it may be bypassed by adversaries with high privileges."
 "D": "Implementing a policy to monitor and filter outbound traffic to prevent data exfiltration of account lists, as this does not directly prevent account enumeration."
Answer: D
