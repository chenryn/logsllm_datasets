Hello,

When I run the following code, the results from the second search are duplicated:

```php
$finder = new Finder();
$first_results = $finder->in('/my/path')->files()->name('/my_pattern/');
// [...] some additional code
$second_results = $finder->in('/my/path')->files()->name('/another_pattern/');
```

However, if I use the code below, it works as intended without any duplication:

```php
$finder = new Finder();
$first_results = $finder->in('/my/path')->files()->name('/my_pattern/');
// [...] some additional code
$finder = new Finder(); // Reinitialize the finder
$second_results = $finder->in('/my/path')->files()->name('/another_pattern/');
```

It appears that reinitializing the `Finder` object before the second search prevents the duplication of results. 

Thank you for your attention.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
