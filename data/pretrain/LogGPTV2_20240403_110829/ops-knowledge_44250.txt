User: Please explain what vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are in network security, and briefly describe their implementation methods and precautions.
Assistant: Vulnerability scanning refers to the use of professional vulnerability scanning tools to conduct a comprehensive scan of the network system to find various possible vulnerabilities. Its implementation method is to identify the service, port and operating system type on the target host by sending a specific request, and conduct various attack tests on the target host to determine the existing vulnerabilities. Precautions for vulnerability scanning include obtaining authorization, not scanning unauthorized hosts, careful planning and preparation before scanning, and detailed analysis and feedback on scanning results. Penetration testing refers to testing the security defense capabilities of the target system by simulating real attacks, so as to discover the loopholes in the system and provide suggestions for improvement. The implementation method is to collect information first, identify the topology, ports, services and other information of the system, and then use technical means such as vulnerability scanning, social engineering attacks, password blasting, and simulate attacks to verify whether the vulnerabilities exist and whether the vulnerabilities can be exploited. Precautions for penetration testing include the need to obtain authorization, strictly abide by laws and regulations, not cause substantial damage to the target system, make good preparations and plans before testing, and conduct detailed analysis and feedback on test results.
