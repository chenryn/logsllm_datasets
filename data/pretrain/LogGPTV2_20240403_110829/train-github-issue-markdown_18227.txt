 **Migrated issue, originally created by Elliot Cameron (@3noch)**
I'm using PostgreSQL and trying to build an array aggregate of tuples by
selecting a column like this:
    sa.func.array_agg(sa.func.row(User.id, User.name))
This parses as an ugly list of characters.
Putting the "row" on the outside works.
    sa.func.row(sa.func.array_agg(User.id), sa.func.array_agg(User.name))
Maybe I'm missing something.
