4. These signals

More effective* 
than RollJam
*More effective ‘iff’ vulnerable: RollJam “breaks” all rolling code-based systems, while RollBack only ~70% of them (see later)

RollBack “in the wild”
Disclaimer
❏ No REAL attempts made in the wild
❏ All recorded signals were permanently deleted after the tests
❏ except for two vehicles for testing the time-agnostic feature of RollBack
❏ afterward, those signals were permanently deleted
❏ RollBack attack (or any replay attack) does not make any harm to the vehicle
❏ key fob might be temporarily blocked
❏ the physical key has to be used once to access the vehicle

Information Classification: General
❏ Evaluation on a limited set of 
vehicles so far
RollBack “in the wild”
❏ “Blurry” conclusion
❏
Age DOES NOT matter
❏
Petrol vs. hybrid DOES NOT matter
❏
Most of the popular Asian cars tested  
ARE affected
❏
All tested Mazda, Honda, Kia ARE vulnerable
❏
All tested Toyota cars ARE safe
❏
All Mfr. 2 and Mfr. 3 ARE affected*
❏
They both need 2 signals only
❏
Most Mfr. 1 RKE ARE affected*
❏
Mazda needs 3 signals
❏
Honda needs 5 signals
❏
Vehicles using Mfr. 4’s RKE ARE NOT 
affected*
*Although not the key fobs have the flaw but probably the receiving unit (typically 
manufactured by other OEMs), we observe a correlation (so far)

RollBack in General
#BHUSA   @BlackHatEvents
RollBack
is instruction-agnostic
something new
#BHUSA   @BlackHatEvents
Information Classification: General
❏ Attackers have even fewer things to do
1. Victim goes to a parking lot (e.g., to do the groceries)
2. Presses the lock button (twice)
a.
most of us press the lock button twice (to conﬁrm)
3. Wait for the victim to come back and capture the 
“unlock” signal
4. PROFIT
RollBack - Instruction-agnostic
❏ Instruction encoded in the signal DOES NOT matter
○ conﬁrmed for Mazda 
❏
we only need 3 consecutive signals
○ conﬁrmed for Kia (see demo later)
❏
any two sequential but NOT STRICTLY CONSECUTIVE signals work
unlock
lock
lock

❏ NOTE:
❏ Car-sharing / Car-renting use cases are the simplest
❏ In car-sharing, the original key is usually inside → vehicle is at risk

Sound bytes a.k.a.
3 KEY TAKEAWAYS
1) RollBack - Capturing and replaying a couple of signals re-synchronizes the 
rolling codes and unlocks most of today’s modern (Asian) vehicles tested
a) RollBack is instruction-agnostic
2) Unlike RollJam, RollBack 
a) does not require signal jamming, only signal capturing once
b) captured signals can be replayed at any time and as many times as desired
3) So far, the root cause is not conﬁrmed and no explicit mitigation exists
a) adding timestamps to the signals (and checking them) might help
