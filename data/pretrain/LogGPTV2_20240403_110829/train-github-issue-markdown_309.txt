## Bug Report
**Current Behavior**  
`Duplicate declaration "x"` is thrown for the below code, this does not happen
when natively run by e.g. Chrome. See @kzc's comments below for clarification
of the ECMA specification where it's also shown that the Bable behavior is
incorrect.
This does not matter in itself, it doesn't make sense to write this code.
However, e.g. Terser correctly treats them as different scopes and reuses
variable names as below if it sees that the for-variable is not used (this
mostly happens when using `.entries()` and you at some point stop referencing
key or value). This makes it fragile to import some pre-minified code in
projects, especially as the error does not show up until it is transpiled by
Babel, the code works on its own.
**Input Code**
    for (let x of [1]) {
      let x=1;
    }
**Expected behavior/code**  
`x` should be shadowed and the code should compile. Again, see @kzc's comments
below for exact expected behavior.
**Environment**  
Easily replicated in the Babel repl (online), 7.4.0, use es2015 or preset-env.

**Possible Solution**  
Do not throw the error, the code should compile.
