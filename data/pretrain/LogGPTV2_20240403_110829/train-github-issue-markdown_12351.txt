@flipside: 'I don't use the data browser graph view as much as I'd like to
because the screen gets cluttered very fast as I add more and more nodes with
all the grey, unselected nodes on the screen. It'd be really great if there
was a button to hide all this unselected nodes and relationships so I can get
an uncluttered look at the part of the graph I'm interested in.
Thanks,
