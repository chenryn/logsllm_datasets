## Abstract
Cryptocurrency mining is the foundation of blockchain-based systems, rewarding miners for validating new transactions. Unlike Bitcoin, which often requires specialized hardware (ASICs), Monero can be mined using standard CPUs, making it a viable option for in-browser mining. This study examines the prevalence of browser-based mining as a new revenue model for website operators. We analyze 138 million domains to identify and classify mining websites, presenting a novel fingerprinting method that detects up to 5.7 times more miners than existing block lists. Our findings highlight Coinhive as the primary browser-mining stakeholder, contributing 1.18% of mined blocks and generating 1293 Moneros in June 2018.

## 1. Introduction
The web economy has traditionally relied on advertisements to monetize free services. Recently, a new model has emerged where website operators use visitors' computational resources to mine cryptocurrencies, generating additional revenue (browser-based mining).

Mining involves solving computationally intensive puzzles to add new blocks to a blockchain, with miners rewarded in cryptocurrency. The difficulty of these puzzles is adjusted based on the combined computing power of all users. For Bitcoin, this often requires specialized hardware, making it impractical for in-browser mining. In contrast, Monero can be efficiently mined using standard CPUs, making it suitable for browser-based mining.

Monero's design has led to its adoption by various websites and even botnets, which exploit compromised hosts for mining. APIs like Coinhive [5] provide frameworks for embedding Monero miners into websites, enabling both consensual and non-consensual (cryptojacking) mining. Our work provides an in-depth analysis of the prevalence and economics of browser-based mining.

### Contributions
- We investigate the prevalence of browser-based mining across 138 million domains.
- We introduce a new WebAssembly-based fingerprinting method to detect mining code.
- We identify Coinhive as the largest browser-based mining provider.
- We present a methodology to associate mined blocks in the Monero blockchain with mining pools.
- We show that Coinhive contributes 1.18% of the blocks in the Monero blockchain, generating approximately $150,000 per month (as of writing).

## 2. Background on Cryptocurrency Mining
Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies rely on a public, tamper-proof series of blocks to record financial transactions. Miners solve cryptographic puzzles (Proof of Work, PoW) to add new blocks, ensuring the system's predictability and security. The difficulty of these puzzles is dynamically adjusted to maintain a constant block rate, and miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their computational efforts.

The increasing difficulty of mining popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin has led to the use of specialized hardware (GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs). Alternatively, mining pools combine the computational power of multiple miners, sharing the rewards.

### Browser-based Mining
Browser-based mining leverages the computational power of website visitors to mine cryptocurrencies. By embedding mining code into websites, operators can generate revenue without the need for dedicated mining hardware. However, hidden or non-consensual mining (cryptojacking) poses significant ethical and security concerns.

### Monero
Launched in 2014, Monero is a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency designed to be ASIC-resistant, making it suitable for CPU-based mining. It uses the Cryptonight hash function in its PoW, with an average block time of two minutes. Figure 1 illustrates the PoW inputs in Monero.

## 3. Prevalence of Browser-based Mining
To assess the prevalence of browser-based mining, we analyzed a large dataset of domains, including .com, .net, .org, and the Alexa Top 1M list. We used two methods to identify mining code: a lightweight approach using TLS and a more comprehensive method involving a Chrome browser to monitor Websocket interactions and WebAssembly (Wasm) code.

### 3.1 NoCoin Filter List
We visited each domain via TLS, downloading the first 256 kB of the landing page. We then extracted JavaScript tags and applied the NoCoin filter list to detect mining code. Figure 2 shows the number of domains with hits to NoCoin filter rules.

### 3.2 WebAssembly-Based Detection
We used a Chrome browser to visit a subset of domains, monitoring Websocket interactions and WebAssembly code. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize our findings, highlighting the effectiveness of our WebAssembly-based fingerprinting method in detecting mining code.

|-------|-------|
| Coinhive | 711 |
| skencituer | 183 |
| cryptoloot | 120 |
| UnknownWSS | 108 |
| notgiven | 92 |

| Alexa   | 993         | 737       | 129               | 608 (82%)        |
| .org    | 978         | 1372      | 450               | 922 (67%)        |
