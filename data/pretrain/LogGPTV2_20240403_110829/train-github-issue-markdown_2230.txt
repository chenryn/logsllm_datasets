I've created the simplest babel programme I can think of, that I would expect
to do nothing.
    var babel = require('babel-core');
    var code = '"use strict";';    // Edited typo
    var result = babel.transform(code);
    // Expected result: "use strict";
    // Actual result: "use strict"; "use strict";
I had presumed that a call to `transform` with no transformers specified would
do nothing. At the very least it's forcing strict mode on me. Is this a bug or
a feature? Are there other things babel forces on me by default?
