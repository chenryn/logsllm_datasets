**Migrated issue, originally created by Ren√© Steetskamp (@otech-nl)**
I have a hybrid property "password" which used to work but after a package
update gave "AttributeError: can't set attribute".
Downgrading to "sqlalchemy<1.2" fixed the issue.
Using sqlite 3.22.0, pipenv, flask and flask-sqlachemy.
Pipfile, execution+stack traces and test script attached.
