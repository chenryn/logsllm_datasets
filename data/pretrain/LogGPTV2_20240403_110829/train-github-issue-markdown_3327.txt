### To Reproduce
  * Open an Electron app (occurs in the latest versions of Slack and VSCode)
  * Move it to the other monitor by dragging with the mouse and let it snap to fullscreen OR move to other monitor with `Windows + Left` key and then `Windows + Up`
### Workaround
Press the `Windows + Left` or `Windows + Right` key to display the app in only
half of the screen  
OR  
Keep the app windowed and drag it to an "almost fullscreen" size
