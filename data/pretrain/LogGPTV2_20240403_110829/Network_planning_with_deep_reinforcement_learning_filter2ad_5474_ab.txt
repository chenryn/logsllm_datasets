the mapping of IP links and underlying fiber paths. All of these
decisions form a network plan that is being procured and deployed
over the months and years. It contributes to the most significant
portion of network infrastructure expenditure.
Secondly, network planning is a multi-phased, iterative process.
Making all these decisions in one shot is complex and does not meet
the operational needs. For instance, building new fiber path takes
much longer time and thus such decision needs to be made several
years a-priori. Thus, in production networks, the planning process
is done over the short-term and long-term horizons respectively to
generate short-term actionable signals for operational teams, while
allowing optimal long-term network evolution strategy. Short-term
planning provides decisions for adding or removing capacity over
existing IP links on a given fiber footprint, for a time range of the
next few months. Long-term planning, on the other hand, decides
the future fiber paths, hardware equipments, and new sites. Note
that the IP topology is up for change in this step. The goal is to
extract the most cost-effective IP topology and the corresponding
IP and optical equipment required to support future IP topologies.
Lastly, network planning is failure-aware. A key objective of net-
work planning is to ensure the reliability of the backbone network
under different failure scenarios such as fiber cuts, site failures
and natural disasters. We illustrate the failure-aware multi-phase
planning in an example in Figure 1. For simplicity, assuming the
traffic demand is a single flow of 100Gbps from site A to site D, the
goal is to plan a network of IP links that satisfies the demand and
minimizes the cost, which is approximated as the number of fibers
used. The failure scenarios to consider are marked as the red cross,
each of which can happen independently. Short-term planning is
to decide the capacity of the two existing IP links, shown as dotted
lines. A single IP link (link 1: A-B-C-D or link 2: A-E-F-D) is not
sufficient, because it would not survive the failures. As shown in
Figure 1(a), we need to build both 100Gbps IP links to ensure that
the flow from A to D is always satisfied when either A-E or B-C
fails.
A long-term planning example is shown in Figure 1(b). Here
we can change both the optical and IP topology. Assume that we
decide to add a new fiber B-F, which also introduces another new
possible failure. There are two options to add a new IP link between
A and D, link 3 (A-B-F-D) and link 4 (A-E-F-B-C-D). Consider three
possible plans: (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), which can satisfy the demand
under any of three possible failures. Plan (1,3) has a lower cost than
the other two, because IP link 1 and 3 share one fiber A-B so that
this plan only consumes 5 fibers while other plans use more fibers.
This example illustrates that both long-term planning and failure
scenarios would result in a potentially large search space to explore.
3 EXISTING APPROACH AND CHALLENGES
In this section, we describe a standard solution to network planning
that is used in a production network. Importantly, we highlight the
scalability challenge of the existing solution and summarize a few
heuristic methods used to tackle the challenge. This challenge and
the ad-hoc workarounds motivate us to explore more intelligent
and more systematic solutions in the rest of this paper.

At a high level, the backbone network topology is abstracted as
a graph where each IP/optical site is represented as a node and the
optical fibers between them make up the edges in a layer 1 (L1)
topology. The IP links traversing over the fibers create an overlay IP
topology, usually referred to as layer 3 (L3) topology. The backbone
traffic is represented as flows between different sites with various
Classes of Services (CoS) based on service characteristics. The over-
all goal of network planning is to minimize the total network cost
while meeting all constraints imposed by hardware and operational
requirements. The problem can be formulated as an optimization
problem under a set of constraints. The mathematical formulation
is described below. Table 1 summarizes the key notations of the
problem formulation.

Objective. The objective of the ILP is to minimize the total network
cost, which is a sum of the cost on optical layer and IP layer. Other
metrics such as flow latency can also be included in the objective
based on operational requirements. The cost of optical layer consists
of one-time procurement cost of fiber pairs, one-time fiber light
up and monthly operating cost. The cost of IP layer comes from
buying IP equipments and operational cost to turn up IP capacities.
For the sake of simplicity, we abstract the cost as the sum of IP link
costs where each link’s cost is proportional to the capacity added
over the IP link as well as the the fiber cost underneath, shown as
Eq 1.

The constraints in Equation 2-5 are explained below.
• Flow conservation constraint (Eq. 2): The amount of egress traffic
needs to be equal to the amount of ingress traffic plus the node’s
self-generated traffic for every flow under every failure scenario.
T ra f f ic(ω , n) is: the volume of ω if n is the source of ω, negative
of the flow volume if n is the sink, and 0 otherwise.
• Link capacity constraint (Eq. 3): The capacity of each IP link is
dictated by the capacity requirement of the aggregated traffic
volume on the link under any failure λ. Note that due to oper-
ational constraints, each IP link can only be turned up in fixed
capacity unit, i.e., Cl s are integer variables in the formulation.
• Spectrum consumption constraint (Eq. 4): At the optical layer, all
constraints are expressed as that the total spectrum consumed is
less than the maximum available spectrum for each fiber [26, 65,
66, 68]. The spectrum consumed over a fiber is the sum of IP link
capacities going over the fiber multiplied by the corresponding
spectrum efficiency (i.e., spectrum consumption to support each
IP capacity unit).
• Existing topology constraint (Eq. 5): For short-term planning, there
is an additional constraint that each link’s capacity should not
deviate from existing production capacity by too much, denoted
by Cmin
. This is to avoid churns of the topology from an opera-
tional perspective. For long-term planning, Cmin
is set to 0 for

For brevity, we focus on the fundamental variables and constraints.
Different routing protocols and traffic engineering system require-
ments (e.g., MPLS tunneling selection [8], OSPF [14]) can be incor-
porated into the problem formulation in practice.

3.2 Pain Points in Today’s Approach
The network planning problem is formulated as an ILP problem
and can be directly solved with an off-the-shelf ILP solver such
as Gurobi [19] and CPLEX [11]. The primary issue of the ILP ap-
proach is the scalability of the ILP solver. For example, one of our
production network has about 100 nodes, 300 links and 500 fail-
ure scenarios. In short-term planning, it is translated into an ILP
problem with 42 million variables and 5 million constraints. In long-
term planning, the number of variables goes up to 400 million. Even
worse, the topology size grows at a rate of 20% per year. In practice,
we heavily use hand-tuned heuristics based on human expertise
to overcome the scalability challenge. For the long-term planning
problem, we can only get an actionable signal after applying heuris-
tics and running the ILP solver for 3-4 days. Below, we describe
the pain points of our existing approach from our experiences of
planning for a large scale WAN.
Short-term planning. In short-term planning, the IP topology is
given, and the task is to decide the capacity on given IP links. For
such cases, building and solving an ILP with thousands of vari-
ables and constraints can be done in a few minutes using existing
commercial solvers. However, since the amount of computation
needed grows exponentially when the topology size increases, the
ILP approach cannot be directly used for large topologies. In such
cases, we rely on heuristics to solve the problem, some of which
are described below.
• Topology decomposition. We decompose the topology into several
smaller sub-topologies, and each sub-topology is solved with
an ILP. The decomposition is usually done by segmenting the
topology into geographical regions where each region is aligned
to actual operational/management blocks of the production net-
work and sizing inter-regional links (generally subsea or long-
haul terrestrial links). The segmentation and stitching are done
manually.
• Topology transformation. We transform the topology to reduce
the problem search space or reduce the number of variables. The
transformation can include actions like enlarging the capacity
unit that can be added over some or all links, restricting capacity
additions on fibers or IP links, or collapsing multiple nodes and
links together. These transformations are determined manually
and decided based on the level of fidelity required from planning
signals.
• Failure selection. Instead of satisfying all failure scenarios jointly,
we only select a subset of the failure scenarios for the ILP (i.e.,
reducing the number of constraints and variables). Based on
the solution, we add more failure scenarios to the ILP until all
scenarios are added. The ordering that the failure scenarios are
added is decided manually.
Different heuristics share the same ideaÐthey all aim to prune the
search space to make the problem tractable. Yet, they all rely on
human expertise and operational experience. It is a tedious, time-
consuming iterative process even for experts as the experts need
to use trial-and-error for the manual parts in the heuristics. As the
search space is pruned, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the
optimality of the solution and the tractability of the ILP. This adds
Network Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning
SIGCOMM ’21, August 23–28, 2021, Virtual Event, Netherlands
additional complexity to the problem, and yet another iterative
process is employed to find a good trade-off. Even worse, such
process has to be done and tuned for every planning problem as
there are no universal heuristics for all the planning problems.
Long-term planning. The ILP approach hits the limit of scalability
for even smaller topologies for long-term planning. As an example,
the candidate set of possible IP links for the global topology at our
scale is larger than ten thousand. Of these ten thousand candidates,
fewer than five hundred may make it to the production topology
based on ILP results. Another challenge is that most ILP solvers
struggle to find an optimal integer solution when starting from
almost zero IP capacities on the candidate links, compared to the
short-term planning (see explanation of Eq. 5).
Most ILP solvers rely on estimating feasible solutions using pro-
prietary heuristic methods and then using branch-and-cut tech-
niques [44, 50] to eliminate sub-optimal solutions. Since the search
space is large, the generic heuristic methods of solvers suffer in
finding good quality solutions for these problems. Further, the pos-
sible number of branches for the long-term planning problem is
too large. Besides the strategies used in short-term planning above,
we leverage warm-start to feed potential feasible solutions to ILP
solvers and help solvers converge faster to an optimal. Warm-start
solutions can include previously known good designs or solutions
from manually crafted heuristics. The warm-start solutions require
considerable manual intervention and domain expertise, and are
iterative and time-consuming.
