ﬁned. Otherwise (if t is good), we recursively apply ∆ to all
direct subterms of t.
We will see (Lemma 10) that if t occurs in π, then the types
of ti in the above deﬁnition are always deﬁned. Note also
that ∆ is deﬁned with respect to the given π and C.
Now, the main idea behind the proof of Proposition 1 is to
apply ∆(·) to π. We then show that (i) ∆(π) is an incomplete
C-dominated derivation modulo XOR for b from T and (ii)
to obtain a complete derivation only C-dominated terms are
needed. The details of the proof are presented next, by a
series of lemmas, some of which are also used in Section 4.
Proof of Proposition 1. The following lemma is easy to
show by structural induction on s:
Lemma 3. Let s and t be messages such that s is ⊕-
reduced, s contains a complete bad subterm s(cid:48), and s ∼ t.
Then, there exists a complete bad subterm t(cid:48) of t such that
t(cid:48) ∼ s(cid:48).
The following lemma says that when substituting variables
in a C-dominated term, then complete bad terms that might
have been introduced by the substitution cannot be canceled
out by the C-dominated term.
Lemma 4. Let rθ ∼ t, for a term t, an ⊕-reduced substi-
tution θ, and a C-dominated term r. Then, for each complete
bad subterm r(cid:48) of rθ there exists a complete (bad) subterm
t(cid:48) of t such that t(cid:48) ∼ r(cid:48).
We now can show that if an instance of a C-dominated
term contains a complete bad subterm, then this term (up to
(cid:39)C) must be part of the substitution with which the instance
was obtained.
Lemma 5. Let θ be a ground substitution and s be a C-
dominated term. Assume that t is a complete bad subterm
of sθ. Then, there exists a variable x and a complete bad
subterm t(cid:48) of θ(x) such that t(cid:48) (cid:39)C t.
The converse of Lemma 5 is also easy to show by structural
induction on s.
Lemma 6. Let θ be a ground substitution and s be a C-
dominated term. If sθ is C-dominated, then so is θ(x) for
every x ∈ var(s).
Similarly to Lemma 5, we can prove the following lemma.
The main observation is that ∆(c⊕t) ∼ c⊕∆(t), for c ∈ C⊕.
Lemma 7. ∆(sθ) ∼ s(∆θ), for a C-dominated term s and
a substitution θ.
Another basic and simple to prove property of ∆ is cap-
tured in the following lemma.
Lemma 8. Let s and t be terms such that s ∼ t. Then,
∆(s) ∼ ∆(t).
The following lemma says that if an instance of a C-
dominated Horn clause contains a complete bad subterm
on its right-hand side, then this term (up to (cid:39)C) already
occurs on the left-hand side.
Lemma 9. Assume that p1(r1), . . . , pn(rn) → p0(s) is a
C-dominated Horn clause, θ is an ⊕-reduced ground substitu-
tion, w, u1, . . . , un are ⊕-reduced messages such that w ∼ sθ
and ui ∼ riθ, for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}.
If w(cid:48) is a complete bad subterm of w, then there exists a
complete bad subterm u(cid:48) of ui, for some i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, such
that u(cid:48) (cid:39)C w(cid:48).
Proof. Suppose that w(cid:48) is a complete bad subterm of w.
Because w ∼ sθ and w is ⊕-reduced, by Lemma 3, there
exists a complete bad subterm t of sθ with w(cid:48) ∼ t. By
Lemma 5, there exists a variable x ∈ var(s) and a complete
bad subterm t(cid:48) of θ(x) with t(cid:48) (cid:39)C t. Because x, as a variable
of s, has to occur also in ri for some i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, the term
t(cid:48) is a (not necessarily complete) subterm of riθ. Since ri is
C-dominated, there exists a complete subterm r(cid:48) of riθ with
r(cid:48) (cid:39)C t(cid:48). Now, recall that t(cid:48) (cid:39)C t and t ∼ w(cid:48). It follows that
r(cid:48) (cid:39)C w(cid:48). Furthermore, since w(cid:48) is bad, so is r(cid:48). Now, by
Lemma 4, there exists a complete bad subterm u(cid:48) of ui such
that u(cid:48) (cid:39)C r(cid:48) (cid:39)C w(cid:48).
The following lemma connects bad terms that occur in a
derivation with the types of their subterms.
Lemma 10. For every n ≥ 1, if π(i) ∼ I(c ⊕ t1 ⊕ ··· ⊕
tn), for c ∈ C⊕ and pairwise ⊕-distinct standard terms
t1, . . . , tn /∈ ˜C, then, for each k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, there exists
j ≤ i such that π(j) ∼ I(˜tk ⊕ tk).
Proof. If n = 1, then I(˜t1 ⊕ t1) belongs to π≤i, by the
deﬁnition of types.
Now, suppose that n > 1. In that case we will show, by
induction on i, something more than what is claimed in the
lemma: If t with t ∼ c ⊕ t1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ tn, c ∈ C⊕, and pairwise
⊕-distinct standard terms ti /∈ ˜C, occurs as a complete bad
subterm in π(i), then, for each k ∈ {1, . . . , n}, there exists
j ≤ i such that π(j) ∼ I(˜tk ⊕ tk).
term in π(i).
Suppose that t, as above, occurs as a complete bad sub-
If there exists t(cid:48) such that t(cid:48) (cid:39)C t and t(cid:48) occurs in π 1 (and thus s is a bad term), then, by
the induction hypothesis, we know that there exists j  1, then I(c ⊕ ˜t1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ ˜tn) ∼
I(∆(c ⊕ t1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ tn)) by the deﬁnition of ∆, and hence,
I(c ⊕ ˜t1 ⊕ ··· ⊕ ˜tn) can be derived from ∆(π 1: In this case, we have that ∆(π(i)) ∼
I(t(cid:48)), and hence, ∆(π(i)) can be derived from ∆(π 1, such
that c1 <C ··· <C cn, then (cid:112)t(cid:113) = (cid:112)c1(cid:113) ⊕ ((cid:112)c2(cid:113) ⊕ (··· ⊕
(cid:112)cn(cid:113))··· ).
• If t is non-standard and t ∼ c ⊕ t(cid:48), for some c ∈ C⊕,
c (cid:54)∼ 0, and standard t(cid:48) not in ˜C, then (cid:112)t(cid:113) = (cid:112)c(cid:113) ⊕ (cid:112)t(cid:48)(cid:113).
We say that a term t is in normal form, if t = (cid:112)t(cid:113). A
substitution θ is in normal form, if θ(x) is in normal form
for each variable x in the domain of θ.
It is easy to see that (cid:112)t(cid:113) = (cid:112)s(cid:113) for C-dominated terms t and
s iﬀ t ∼ s, and that (cid:112)t(cid:113) is ⊕-reduced for any t. By C⊕
norm, we
denote the set {(cid:112)c(cid:113) | c ∈ C⊕}. Clearly, this set is ﬁnite and
computable in exponential time in the size of C.
To deﬁne the set Σ(t) of substitutions, we need the notion
of fragile subterms. For a C-dominated term t, the set of
fragile subterms of t, denoted by F(t), is F(t) = {s | s is
a non-ground, standard term which occurs as a subterm of
t in the form t(cid:48) ⊕ s or s ⊕ t(cid:48) for some t(cid:48)}. For example,
F((a ⊕ (cid:104)x, b(cid:105)) ⊕ b) = {(cid:104)x, b(cid:105)}.
We are now ready to deﬁne the (ﬁnite and eﬀectively com-
putable) set Σ(t) of substitutions for a C-dominated term t.
The main property of this set is the following: For every
C-dominated, ground substitution θ in normal form, there
exists a substitution σ ∈ Σ(t) and a substitution θ(cid:48) such
that (cid:112)tθ(cid:113) = ((cid:112)tσ(cid:113))θ(cid:48).
In other words, the substitutions
in Σ(t) yield all relevant instances of t. All ground, nor-
malized instances are syntactic instances of those instances.
This resembles the ﬁnite variant property of XOR [12] men-
tioned in the introduction. However, our construction of
Σ(t) is tailored and optimized towards C-dominated terms
and substitutions. More importantly, we obtain a stronger
property in the sense that the equality—(cid:112)tθ(cid:113) = ((cid:112)tσ(cid:113))θ(cid:48)—
is syntactic equality, not only equality modulo AC; the no-
tion of C-domination, which we introduced here, is crucial in
order to obtain this property. Having syntactic equality is
important for our reduction in order to get rid of algebraic
properties completely.
Deﬁnition 4. Let t be a C-dominated term. We deﬁne a
family of substitutions Σ(t) as follows. The domain of every
substitution in Σ(t) is the set of all variables which occur in
some s ∈ F(t). Now, σ ∈ Σ, if for each x ∈ dom(σ) one of
the following cases holds:
(i) σ(x) = x,
norm, c (cid:54)= 0,
(ii) x ∈ F (t) and σ(x) = c ⊕ x, for some c ∈ C⊕
(iii) there exists s ∈ F(t) with x ∈ var(s) and a C-
dominated substitution θ in normal form such that
sθ ∈ C⊕ and σ(x) = θ(x).
To illustrate the deﬁnition and the property mentioned
above, consider, as an example, t = c ⊕ x and the sub-
stitution θ(x) = d ⊕ m, with d ∈ C⊕
