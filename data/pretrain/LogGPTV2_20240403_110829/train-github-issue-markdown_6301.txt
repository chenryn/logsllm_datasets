I have a javascript node project with some TypeScript definition files inside
it. My jsconfig.json is as follows:  
{  
"compilerOptions": {  
"target": "ES6",  
"module": "commonjs"  
}  
}
If I rename a javascript source file to temp_hello.js or even temple.js
(imagine if temples were in my business domain!) then the intellisense stops
working for the file (it does not pick up anything in the typescript
definition files) and it also forgets my jsconfig.json settings. That means I
can't use ES6 syntax anymore!
