When I run my Bootstrap project locally, the bottom border of the glyphicons in the documentation disappears. Is this normal?

To make the issue clearer and to ensure a more accurate response, you might want to provide additional details, such as:
- The version of Bootstrap you are using.
- The browser and its version.
- Any custom CSS or JavaScript that might be affecting the display.
- Screenshots or specific examples of the problem.

This will help in diagnosing the issue more effectively.
