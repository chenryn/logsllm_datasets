**ATT&CK ID:** T0805  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Block Serial COM

Adversaries may block access to serial COM ports to prevent instructions or configurations from reaching target devices. Serial Communication (COM) ports are commonly used in control systems to facilitate communication with various devices. These devices can receive command and configuration messages via serial COM, and they also use these ports to send command and reporting messages. By blocking the serial COM, adversaries can effectively prevent both incoming commands and outgoing reports, thereby disrupting the normal operation and monitoring of the targeted devices.
