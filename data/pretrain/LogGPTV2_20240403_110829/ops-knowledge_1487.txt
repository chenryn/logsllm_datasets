User: Analyze eSight network device management logs, analyze network device configuration file modification operations in the last hour, and see if there are any security operations involving ACLs in domain fields.
Assistant: To analyze eSight network device management logs, specifically focusing on network device configuration file modification operations involving ACLs in domain fields in the last hour, you can follow these steps in Rizhiyi(Log Easy) using the Search Processing Language (SPL):

Identify the Source Data: First, determine how eSight logs are indexed in Rizhiyi. This typically involves knowing the source, appname, or index where eSight logs are stored. For our example, let's assume they are stored in an index named esight_logs.

Timeframe Specification: Since you're interested in the last hour, use a time range filter in your SPL query.

Keyword Filtering: Look for keywords that indicate configuration file modification and ACL (Access Control List) operations.

Field Extraction: If the logs contain structured data with specific fields for configuration changes, ACL operations, and domain fields, use these fields in your SPL query.

Security Operations: Identify what constitutes a security operation in the context of your logs.

Given these steps, your SPL query might look something like this:

```
starttime="-1h" _index:esight_logs "configuration file modified" ACL domain operation:"*security*" // Filtering for security operations
| table timestamp, hostname, user, operation, file, details // Formatting the output
```

This is a basic SPL query. You might need to adjust the field names (hostname, user, operation, file, details) and the specific keywords ("configuration file modified", ACL, domain, operation:"*security*") based on the actual structure and content of your eSight logs.

Remember, this is just a starting point. Depending on the exact nature of your logs and what you're looking for, the query might need further refinement.
