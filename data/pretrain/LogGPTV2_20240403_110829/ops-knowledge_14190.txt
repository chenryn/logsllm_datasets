User: I am using Canopy enthought on a machine without su access.
Whenever i try to build any package dependent on python I get this error:
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpython2.7
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
error: command 'g++' failed with exit status 1
Any idea what's going wrong?
I am running Debian OS. 
Thanks
Assistant: Depending on what version of Canopy you're using, try to set your LIBRARY_PATH variable. 
Example: export LIBRARY_PATH=~/Enthought/lib
Then try to build the package. This worked for me but I don't know the root cause as to why Canopy virtual environment isn't setting this variable.
