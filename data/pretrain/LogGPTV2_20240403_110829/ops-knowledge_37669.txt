User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题password brute force over ssh? (not on ssh) Can  Hydra  ssh to remote host and attempt a password list against su root?
I am trying to recover the root password to an old device. It is an old Apple jailbroken Apple device, running IOS8.
The device is somewhat slow, but have no rate limit or delays. I am able to run 150 tries/min with hydra for the ssh password.
I can log in as one user, and I could try the passwords much faster (i.e. without SSH handshake every 3 tries) using su root. But it is not possible to run hydra there, i need hydra to login and then try the commands.
Is this possible with hydra? Should I use some other tool?

Assistant: Hydra does not support that mode.
The closest it comes is the Cisco Enable mode, where a telnet connection is used to log into the device and then the enable command is repeated to try different potential enable passwords.  It might be possible to write a new module by cribbing code from hydra-cisco-enable.c and hydra-ssh.c to do what you want.
Alternately, if you have expect, you can use that to write a password guessing script.
