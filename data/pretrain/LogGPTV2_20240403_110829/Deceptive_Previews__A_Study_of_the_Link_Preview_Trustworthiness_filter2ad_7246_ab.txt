### Objective
Our analysis aims to explore the requests made by social media platforms and to investigate the coherence between link previews and the actual content of web pages.

### Experimental Setup
For this analysis, we designed a set of controlled experiments. These experiments involve one user submitting links to test web pages that we control, while another user observes the generated link preview. We registered two user accounts for each platform. Notably, Facebook is the only platform that offers test accounts, which are separate from regular user accounts.

### Visible Features
We used the following symbols to denote the visibility of fields in the link previews:
- **(cid:32)**: The field was observed in all experiments.
- **(cid:35)**: The field was never observed.
- **(cid:71)(cid:35)**: The presence of the field depends on the context, such as meta tags or user edits.

### Priority
We used the following notations to indicate the priority of different types of tags:
- **O**: Open Graph
- **T**: Twitter Cards
- **H**: Standard HTML tags

### Browsers and Devices
We conducted our experiments using the following browsers:
- Firefox (version 69.0 for Ubuntu 18.04)
- Chrome (version 77.0.3865.75 for Ubuntu 18.04)
- Brave Software (version 0.68.132 based on Chromium 76.0.3809.132 for Ubuntu 18.04)

For instant messaging (IM) platforms, we used two mobile phones with different SIM cards:
- iPhone 5S (OS version 12.4.1)
- Android Pixel device (OS version Android 9)

### Web Server Configuration
To serve our test pages, we set up an Internet-facing web server that delivers resources over different subdomains. Each social media platform and experiment had a unique subdomain, ensuring high isolation. The web server was configured to deliver test pages only when accessed via these unique subdomains, reducing noise from search engine bots and rogue web scans. All web pages in our experiments contained a unique page title, text paragraphs, and one image. Depending on the specific test, web pages could contain Open Graph and Twitter Cards meta tags in various combinations. We logged the main fields of the HTTP requests incoming to the server for further analysis.

### Link Preview Layouts
Table IV categorizes the link preview layouts by visual similarity, i.e., the same field order and position. The color coding is as follows:
- **Red**: Domain name
- **Green**: Image
- **Yellow**: Site title
- **Purple**: Site description
- **Blue**: URL

### Displayed Information
Link previews aim to summarize the content of embedded links by showing a site name, an image, and a brief description of the web page's content. These fields originate from the web page's HTML code, either from standard HTML tags or from ad-hoc meta tags like Open Graph or Twitter Cards. Our goal is to understand the exact information shown across different social media platforms and trace back the content of each preview field to the web page.

### Controlled Experiments
We defined a set of controlled experiments by posting links to resources hosted on our web server and observing the resulting link previews. We created web pages with Open Graph or Twitter meta tags, both meta tags at the same time, and no meta tags. Unique values (titles, descriptions, and images) were used for each meta tag to identify the exact source of the data values used in the preview creation. We also studied how link previews change for pages delivered with redirections, repeating our experiments using server-side and client-side redirections.

#### 1. Visible Features
- **Inconsistent Use and Position of Fields**: All platforms include a different combination of fields: title, description, image, domain name, and shared URL. There is no regular usage of these fields, and no field is always displayed. The most common fields are the site title (16 out of 20 platforms) and the hostname (14 platforms). The image field is not always shown, and 11 out of 20 platforms may fail to show an image if the linked web page does not include the meta tag for images.
- **Shared URL Field**: Social networks do not show the shared URL in the preview, while IMs show it in the textbox of the userâ€™s message.
- **Meta Tags Impact**: Across all platforms, 25 fields are not present in the link preview when the linked web page does not include any meta tags. This behavior may be due to HTML parser shortcomings or intentional decisions by developers to reduce processing costs.

#### 2. Heterogeneous Link Preview Templates
- **Consistent Templates**: Only nine out of 20 platforms (Facebook, VK, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Medium, Messenger, Snapchat, Line, and Viber) create link previews with a consistent number and types of fields, regardless of the presence of meta tags.
- **Inconsistent Templates**: The remaining eleven platforms vary their preview templates with the presence of meta tags. For example, Instagram shows only the title and shared URL for pages with only HTML tags.
- **Visual Position**: We identified 14 distinct template layouts, grouped by the same order and position of fields.

#### 3. Priority
- **Meta Tags Usage**: The content of link previews predominantly originates from meta tags, even when they differ from the content of the page. Open Graph is the most used markup language for link previews, followed by Twitter Cards, which has more usage among IMs.
- **User Actions**: Some fields, such as the URL shown when the user hovers over the link preview, can be inspected only upon an action. Social networks typically show the original URL, but some prefer to show a shortened URL or a dereferenced page. Facebook and Messenger also provide a "Context Button" to display additional information about the domain name.

#### 4. Page Redirections
- **Redirection Impact**: We repeated the previous experiments with server-side and client-side redirections to study how link previews are generated for redirected pages.

### User Agents
- **Number of User Agents**: The number of user agents used for each platform varies. For example, Facebook uses two user agents, while VK, Twitter, LinkedIn, Tumblr, and others use one or more.

This comprehensive analysis provides insights into the consistency and variability of link preview generation across different social media platforms.
