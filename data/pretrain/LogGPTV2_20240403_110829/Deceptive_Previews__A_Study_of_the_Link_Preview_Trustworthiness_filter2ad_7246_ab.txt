used to discover social media platforms’ requests. Finally, our
analysis investigates the extent to which the coherence between
previews and web pages content holds.
Experimental Setup: For the analysis of this section, we
prepared a set of controlled experiments. Our experiments in-
volve a user submitting links of test web pages we control, and
another user observing the created link preview. Accordingly,
we registered two user accounts for each platform. Facebook
is the only platform offering test accounts, which are users
separated from regular users.

TABLE III: Characterization of the link preview creation. For
the visible features, we use “(cid:32)” when we observed a ﬁeld in
all of our experiments, “(cid:35)” when we never observed a ﬁeld,
and “(cid:71)(cid:35)” when the presence of the ﬁeld depends on the context,
e.g., meta tags or user edits. We use “DP” for dereferal page,
“SU” for shortened URL, and URL for the shared URL. For
the priority, we use “O” for Open Graph, “T” for Twitter Cards,
and “H” for standard HTML tags.
We conducted our experiments on social networks us-
ing Firefox (version 69.0 for Ubuntu 18.04), Chrome
(77.0.3865.75 for Ubuntu 18.04) and Brave Software (0.68.132
based on Chromium 76.0.3809.132 for Ubuntu 18.04)
browsers. For IMs, we purchased two mobile phone SIM cards
and used two different mobile phones for our experiments, i.e.,
an iPhone 5S (OS version 12.4.1) and an Android Pixel device
(OS version Android 9).
To serve our test pages, we set up an Internet-facing
web server serving resources over different subdomains. We
used one subdomain for each social media platform and each
experiment, achieving a high degree of isolation among the
experiments on one platform and across all platforms. Also,
we conﬁgured our web server to deliver test pages only when
accessed via one of the unique subdomains and not through
our public IP address, reducing the noise caused by bots
of search engines and rogue web scans. All web pages of
our experiments contain a unique page title, text paragraphs,
and one image. Depending on the speciﬁc test, web pages
can contain Open Graph and Twitter Cards meta tags in
different combinations. We detail the content of meta tags in
the corresponding subsection below. Finally, we logged the
main ﬁelds of the HTTP requests incoming to the server, for
further analysis.

TABLE IV: Color-coded link preview layouts grouped by visual similarity, i.e., same ﬁeld order and position. Color coding: Red
is for the domain name, green for the image, yellow for the site title, purple for the site description, and blue for the URL.
A. Displayed Information
Link previews intend to summarize the content of the
embedded links, by showing a site name, an image, and a brief
description of the web page’s content, typically. These ﬁelds
originate from the web page’s HTML code, either from the
standard HTML tags or from ad-hoc meta tags such as Open
Graph or Twitter Cards markups. The goal of this section is
learning the exact information shown to a user across different
social media platforms, and tracing back the content of each
preview ﬁeld to the web page.
To that end, we deﬁned a set of controlled experiments
by posting links to resources hosted on our web server, and
observing the resulting link preview. As the link preview could
show data originating from both standard HTML tags and
meta tags, we created web pages with Open Graph or Twitter
meta tags, both meta tags at the same time, and no meta tags.
When creating our test pages, we used unique values (i.e.,
titles, descriptions, and images) for each of the meta tags to
allow us to identify the exact source of the data values used
by the preview creation. Also, we intend to study the ways the
link preview may change for pages delivered with redirections.
Accordingly, we repeated our experiments using server-side
and client-side redirections. Table III summarizes the result of
our analysis.
1) Visible Features: We start our analysis by pinpointing
the exact ﬁelds that social media platforms include in link pre-
views and their location. Table III, columns “Visible Features”,
lists the displayed ﬁelds that we observed. We say that a link
previews created during our experiments. We say that a link
preview ﬁeld is visible (“(cid:32)”) when the ﬁeld is present in all
preview ﬁeld is not visible (“(cid:35)”) when the ﬁeld is not present
a ﬁeld may be visible (symbol “(cid:71)(cid:35)”) when at least one link
preview shows that ﬁeld. Table IV shows the position of each
ﬁeld per platform.
in any link preview of our experiments. Finally, we say that
a) Inconsistent Use and Position of Fields: All plat-
forms include a different combination of the following ﬁelds:
title of the web page, description of the web page, an image,
the domain name, and the shared URL. We observed that there
is no regular usage of these ﬁelds and that there is no ﬁeld that
is always displayed. The ones that are presented by most of
the platforms are the site title (16 over 20 platforms) and the
hostname (14 platforms). Then, interestingly, the image ﬁeld
is not shown all the times, and 11 platforms out of 20 may
5
fail in showing an image when, for example, the linked web
page does not include the meta tag for images.
When looking at the shared URL ﬁeld, we observed a
noticeable difference between social networks and instant
messaging platforms. As opposed to IMs, none of the social
networks shows the shared URL in the preview. However, we
need to clarify that IMs do not have a dedicated ﬁeld for the
URL. Instead, by default, IMs show the URL in the textbox
of the user’s message.
Finally,
the content of
link previews varies with the
presence of meta tags. Across all platforms, a total of 25
ﬁelds are not present in the link preview when the linked
web page does not include any meta tag, i.e., the web page
contains only standard HTML tags. Such behavior may be
caused by shortcomings of HTML parser, or more probably,
by intentional decisions of the developers due to the cost of
processing a large number of web pages.
b) Heterogeneous Link Preview Templates: When visit-
ing Table III per platform, one can observe that only nine plat-
forms out of 20 (Facebook, VK, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Medium,
Messenger, Snapchat, Line and Viber) create link previews
with a consistent number and types of ﬁelds, regardless the
presence of meta tags. However, when looking at the variety
of ﬁelds shown across these nine platforms, we observe four
different sets of ﬁelds indicating that there may not be an
accepted consensus on which ﬁelds constitute a link preview.
For example, the previews created by Facebook and Medium
include all ﬁelds except for the shared URL, which is instead
present in Messenger. VK, LinkedIn, Snapchat and Viber show
only site title, image, and hostname, whereas both Pinterest and
Line show a different subset of ﬁelds each (Pinterest’s title and
description have to be user-provided at posting time).
Then, the preview created by the remaining eleven plat-
forms varies with the presence of meta tags. Interestingly, the
absence of these ﬁelds is not consistent within the same plat-
form. Only three platforms (Twitter, Telegram, and Slack) fail
to build a preview of pages containing only standard HTML
tags. The previews of the other eight platforms incoherently
display ﬁelds. For example, Instagram shows only the title and
the shared URL of pages with only HTML tags.
Finally, when looking at the visual position of ﬁeld in the
preview, we identiﬁed 14 distinct template layouts. Table IV
lists the layouts we observed, grouping layouts by same order
of ﬁelds and position.
2) Priority: The second part of our analysis studies the
behavior of the platforms when processing web pages with
multiple meta tags and without meta tags. The goal of this
analysis is to learn the importance assigned to each ﬁeld.
Table III, columns “Priority”, summarizes our ﬁndings. We
use the letter H for standard HTML tags, the letter O for the
Open Graph meta tags, and the letter T for Twitter Cards. The
three letters are ordered from left to right by priority. When
we cannot establish a clear priority, e.g., the preview contains
a mix of tags, we use the symbol “||”. We cross a letter when
the type of tag is never used for the preview.
Our analysis reveals that, with few exceptions, the content
of link previews originates predominantly from the meta tags,
even when they differ from the content of the page. For exam-
ple, concerning the hostname ﬁeld, Facebook, Messenger and
WhatsApp show the domain name of the URL of the og:url
meta tag even when it differs from the URL hosting the
resource. We observed similar behavior with Xing, Telegram,
and Slack, that show the content of the og:site_name meta
tag in the host ﬁeld. A few platforms, i.e., Pinterest and VK,
directly prompt the user for text for the preview when the
platforms fail at rendering the link preview.
Finally, we observe that Open Graph is, by far, the most
used markup language for link previews. Open Graph is also
the ﬁrst one displayed by all platforms except for three, i.e.,
Twitter, Skype and Viber. While Twitter Cards seems to be
rarely used by social networks, it has a bigger userbase among
IMs, where only two platforms (Messenger and KakaoTalk) do
not seem to support it.
3) User Actions: The third analysis of this section involves
ﬁelds that a user can inspect only upon an action. We identiﬁed
two of such ﬁelds (see, Table III, columns “User Actions”).
The ﬁrst ﬁeld is the URL shown when the user moves
the mouse over the link preview. Typically, when moving the
mouse over an anchor tag, the browser shows in the status
bar the hyperlink. Social networks respect such an expected
behavior; however, 50% of the social networks do not show
the original URL in the status bar but prefer showing either
a shortened URL (“SU”) or a dereferer page (“DP”). By
dereferer page we indicate a social network-speciﬁc proxy
interposed between the user and the shared web page, e.g.
as a click aggregator.
The second ﬁeld is speciﬁc only to Facebook and Mes-
senger. Within the link preview, both platforms show an
additional UI button—called ”Context Button”4—to display
a dialog box with additional information about the domain
name of the og:url tag. Such additional information, when
available, includes (i) content from Wikipedia, (ii) domain
name registration date from the WHOIS database, (iii) a link
to the Facebook page associated to the domain name, (iv) the
number of times that link was shared, and (v) a map showing
the locations on earth of users who shared the link.
4) Page redirections: The ﬁnal analysis of this section stud-
ies the link preview generation when pages are delivered with
redirections. For that, we repeated the previous experiments
