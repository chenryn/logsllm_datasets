ABSTRACT
Email is still one of the most common ways of communica-
tion in our digital world, the underlying Simple Mail Trans-
port Protocol (SMTP) is crucial for our information society.
Back when SMTP was developed, security goals for the ex-
changed messages did not play a major role in the protocol
design, resulting in many types of design limitations and
vulnerabilities. Especially spear-phishing campaigns take
advantage of the fact that it is easy to spoof the originat-
ing email address to appear more trustworthy. Furthermore,
trusted brands can be abused in email spam or phishing cam-
paigns. Thus, if no additional authentication mechanisms
protect a given domain, attackers can misuse the domain. To
enable proper authentication, various extensions for SMTP
were developed in the past years.
In this paper, we analyze the three most common meth-
ods for originating DNS domain email authentication in a
large-scale, longitudinal measurement study. Among other
findings, we confirm that Sender Policy Framework (SPF) still
constitutes the most widely used method for email authen-
tication in practice. In general, we find that higher-ranked
domains use more authentication mechanisms, but some-
times configuration errors emerge, e.g., we found that ama-
zon.co.jp had an invalid SPF record. A trend analysis shows a
(statistically significant) growing number of domains using
SPF. Furthermore, we show that the Domain-based Message
Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) dis-
tribution evolved significantly as well by increasing tenfold
over the last five years. However, is still far from being per-
fect with a total adoption rate of about 11%. The US and
UK governmental domains are an exception, given that both
have a high adoption rate due to binding legal directives. Fi-
nally, we study DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) adoption

in detail and find a lower bound of almost 13% for DKIM us-
age in practice. In addition, we reveal various flaws, such as
weak or shared duplicate keys. As a whole, we find that about
3% of the domains use all three mechanisms in combination.

1 INTRODUCTION
The exchange of email messages based on Simple Mail Trans-
port Protocol (SMTP) is a standard communication channel on
the Internet. SMTP does not provide any security features;
thus, an attacker can easily abuse the protocol to launch
spam, phishing, or other types of social-engineering cam-
paigns. Even current malware like Emotet campaigns use
spoofed E-mails for further spreading. In particular, sender
identities cannot be verified, which enables different types
of impersonation/spoofing attacks. This leads to fake emails
representing a major Internet problem with an estimated
6.4 billion fake emails per day [42]. To combat this ever-
increasing problem, several extensions for SMTP were devel-
oped to improve the security and especially authentication in
the context of emails. For example, PGP and S/MIME provide
a way to make email communication more secure for indi-
vidual messages if both the sender and receiver of the mes-
sage actively use these applications. Other techniques can be
configured directly by the domain owner. First, encryption
techniques, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), encrypt
the communication channel to guarantee the integrity of
messages. In addition, several authentication mechanisms
were developed to ensure authentic information who sent a
specific message. More specifically, three DNS-based authen-
tication methods were developed in the past years: Sender
Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM),
354RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain

and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and
Conformance (DMARC).
Previous work already examined the distribution of SPF
and DMARC adoption on the Internet in 2015 [11, 13] and
most recently in January 2018 [19]. However, some time
has passed since the last set of thorough measurements and
email spoofing continues to be a major problem. Hence, we
argue that we need to regularly measure, determine how
much progress is being made, and make recommendations
on how to move forward. In our work, we do not simply
intend to reflect the current state of affairs again, but also
to draw attention in particular to the trends in development.
In addition, we think that this topic also needs to be revis-
ited given the growing importance of this topic: a binding
directive has been published by the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) which states that all official US domains
should use DMARC with the Reject policy starting October
16, 2018 (BOD-18-01) [4]. There is also a British counterpart
to the directive [40] and a recommendation for the EU to
use DMARC for administrative domains [12]. Nevertheless,
there are still examples where these basic methods are still
not used, e.g., most of the 2020 US presidential candidates did
not use DMARC for their campaign domains [41]. We believe
that Internet-wide protocol measurements are necessary to
understand the current state of adoption better and to pro-
vide guidance on how it can be improved. Furthermore, we
understand this work as a wake-up call to further increase
the support of these protocols.
In this paper, we analyze the three most common DNS-
based authentication methods in a large-scale, one and a half
year long measurement study motivated by a case study and
discussion on design limitations. On the one hand, we imple-
mented a DNS crawler that collects and stores the matching
TXT records for SPF and DMARC over time. On the other
hand, we analyzed email dumps to learn common patterns of
selectors of DKIM keys to implement a second DNS crawler
for measuring usage of DKIM in the wild. We performed
our measurement study between December 2018 and May
2020 with the top 1 million domains listed in the three lists
Alexa [2], Majestics [27], and Tranco [25]. Our results show
that SPF and DMARC increase significantly in use, thus, we
are making progress in this area. Furthermore, the results
confirm that SPF is still the most widely used authentica-
tion protocol with an adoption rate of about 50%. We verify
also that well-known, higher-ranked domains more often
support mail authentication, but implementation errors can
occur so that domains like amazon.co.jp or imgur.com have
invalid SPF records. In case of the top 100 domains, we as-
sume some kind of saturation (on average up to 89%), since
we could not measure any changes over time. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the used policies improved over the last
few years and a graph-based analysis reveals that Google and
Microsoft are the most trusted organizations on the Internet
regarding SPF. We find that the DMARC adoption rate is
developing well and shows high rates, especially for .gov and
.edu domains. However, most DMARC records use the None
policy (∼70%), but not the Reject policy (∼15%). Regarding
DKIM our findings indicate that it is implemented by at least
about 13% of all domains.
Our study provides enhanced insights into the use of the
three protocols through an in-depth analysis, and we are the
first to directly analyze DKIM besides SPF and DMARC with
a new method to measure the adoption: for gathering DKIM
keys, we need the so-called DKIM key selector string. Given
that this selector is not public and chosen by the adminis-
trator, it can vary depending on the domain. By analyzing
email dumps, we can learn how DKIM key selector strings
are chosen in practice and this allows us to generate a list of
potential selector strings that we can use in a measurement
study to obtain a lower bound of DKIM adoption in the wild.
Furthermore, this analysis enables us to collect DKIM keys
and study their properties. Amongst other findings, we de-
tected 4,312 weak keys with a key length of 384 bits (66 times)
or 786 bits (4,246 times), and 2,302 duplicated keys which
were used by 654,089 domains in total. Overall, we find that
only 3% of the domains examined use all three mechanisms
together.
In summary, we make the following key contributions:
(1) We evaluate 25 popular email providers in a case study
and discuss potential flaws that enable successful at-
tacks against authentication methods for SMTP.
(2) We study the current state of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
deployment in practice by conducting a large-scale,
one and a half year long measurement study based
on three different domain datasets and compare our
findings to previous work on this topic. In particular,
we focus on how the adoption state evolves over time.
(3) We perform a comprehensive analysis of SPF usage,
e.g., by creating two graphs based on the requested
SPF records.
(4) We contribute new insights on DKIM keys, in partic-
ular cryptographically weak keys and duplicate keys
shared among multiple domains.
2 DNS-BASED EMAIL AUTHENTICATION
2.1 Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
SPF allows publishing hosts that are authorized to send
emails on behalf of a given domain (RFC 7208 [20]). To use
SPF, a domain owner specifies a range of hosts that are au-
thorized to send emails on its behalf in a DNS TXT record.
When receiving an email, the recipient can validate via a
DNS request whether an authorized host sent the received
355The Evolution of DNS-based Email Authentication:
Measuring Adoption and Finding Flaws
email or not. Moreover, the recipient extracts the sender’s
SPF policy and decides whether to reject the message or not.
A SPF record contains the version and all IP addresses that
are authorized to send messages on behalf of the domain.
There are different mechanisms to define trusted servers. On
the one hand, single IP addresses, as well as whole address
ranges, can be configured directly. On the other hand, the
include mechanism makes it possible to combine several SPF
records. This allows a complete SPF record to be composed
of several individual SPF records.
If an SPF verification is successful, the message is for-
warded to the recipient. If it fails, the further processing of
the message depends on the defined SPF qualifiers. Four dif-
ferent qualifiers exist: pass (default), fail, softfail, and neutral.
The verification process can also lead to errors. If the syntax
is not correct, this leads to a permerror, e.g., if a unresolved
domain is included that does not exist.
2.2 DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)
DKIM offers the possibility to check received email mes-
sages for modifications or spoofing (see RFC 6376 [22]). To
use DKIM, a sender must attach a DKIM signature to the mes-
sage header. The following tags are required in every DKIM
signature. v= indicates the version of DKIM, a= indicates the
used algorithm for generating the signature, s= indicates the
selector name that is necessary to gather the public key in
DNS, d= indicates the used domain, h= is a list of header data
which will be used during the signing algorithm to create
the hash in b=, b= is the hash data (DKIM signature) Base64
encoded, and bh= is the hash of the message body.
The full message then includes the entire content of the
email, the header signed with the private key of the sender’s
domain, and the selector string for the DKIM DNS request.
Thus, the recipient can obtain the public key via a spe-
cial DNS request and verify the signature. The DKIM DNS
records are stored in the following format: selector._-
domainkey.domain. The domainkey is a fixed string, and the
selector is a randomly chosen string by the domain owner.
The receiving email server initiates signature verification. In
the first step, the key is requested via the specified selector
string and the corresponding domain via DNS. If no public
key exists or if this key is revoked, the message is treated as
if it had no DKIM signature. If a public key is retrieved, the
signature can be verified.
2.3 Domain-based Message Authentication,
Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
DMARC is based on both SPF and DKIM. In DMARC, it is
possible to propose policies for handling SPF and DKIM (see
RFC 7489 [23]). Again, the DNS TXT record is used to pub-
lish that the domain email authentication is supported and
RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain
which policies are defined, such as how the authentications
are to be handled. For the DMARC verification, if available,
a DKIM and a SPF verification are performed, and the results
are stored for the DMARC verification. SPF and DKIM per-
form their validation on two different aspects of the message.
These values might be different, but DMARC requires them
to be equal to pass. If not, the specified DMARC policy will
be applied. Three different policies exist: none, quarantine,
and reject. The none policy states that the message will be
delivered to the receiver and treated like any other email.
The quarantine policy marks the message as suspicious, but
it will be delivered. Depending on the receiver’s client, the
message will be placed in the spam folder. The reject policy
states that the message will be rejected by the email server
and not delivered to the receiver.
3 MOTIVATIONAL CASE STUDY AND
DISCUSSION
3.1 Case Study: Free Email Providers
As part of the first case study, we analyzed 25 popular web-
based email providers. For the selection of the providers,
we combined different sources. We obtained all free email
services (17 providers) analyzed by Hu et al. [19]. Second, we
expanded this by adding domains from the same services, e.g.,
hotmail.com and outlook.com. Third, we searched on Google
for further popular email providers. The most popular email
providers of the US are Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, and AOL.
Gmail alone has about 1.5 billion active users [15]. Thus,
the results of this case study represent a significant fraction
of people worldwide. Table 7 in Appendix A summarizes
our findings. We found that only one email provider does
not support any authentication (t-online.de). Otherwise, SPF
is at least supported by all others and DKIM is supported
by 18 out of the 25 studied email providers. The examined
providers least support DMARC, 14 out of 25 implement
it.
The policy for SPF was mostly configured as softfail or
hardfail, and only in three cases as neutral. None of the
providers uses the pass mechanism. The number of autho-
rized subnets and IP addresses differs significantly: while
Firemail, for example, only authorizes a single IP address
via SPF, there are others like AOL or Hotmail that publish
hundreds of thousands of IP addresses in their SPF records.
Regarding DKIM, most providers with the top-level domain
.de do not offer DKIM as web.de, gmx.de, or freenet.de. Inter-
estingly, the premium version of gmx.de and web.de support
DKIM. The observed key lengths are good (1024 or 2048 bits).
All providers with DKIM use the rsa-sha256 algorithm for
signing and verification. In case of DMARC, eight providers
use testing mode with the None policy (e.g., gmail.com), two
356RAID ’21, October 6–8, 2021, San Sebastian, Spain

use the Quarantine policy, and four use the strictest Reject
policy.
The overall results indicate that most email providers are
aware of email authentication and started to use it. We found
that DMARC support has the biggest need to catch up, espe-
cially because it should not be applied with the None policy
given that no security gain is obtained with this configu-
ration. This leads to the question of what the overall adop-
tion rate and configuration looks like on an Internet-wide
scale.
3.2 Discussion: SPF and DKIM Design
Limitations
We learned that most popular email providers implement at
least SPF. Thus a simple spoofing attack is more difficult to
perform. However, a design limitation of SPF is that it verifies
the MAIL FROM header only. This header is inside the FROM
header, which is not verified. Therefore, the verification does
not check if both values contain the same domain, allowing
to bypass SPF verification. This is possible for all domains
that implement SPF only. So the research question arises:
how widespread is the usage of SPF in practice?
Moreover, DKIM provides additional security compared
to SPF because it attaches a signature of the header and body
to the email message. A private key is used for signing and
a public key for verification. When using DKIM, it is crucial
to use secure keys. Keys under a length of 1024 bits are
considered insecure because they can be factorized (i.e., an
attacker can try to calculate the private key from the public
key). Another typical problem in practice is key management;
e.g., one should not use duplicate keys. Otherwise, other
people can also sign messages successfully. The research
question is: how many weak keys or duplicate keys are used
in the wild?
A design issue with DKIM is that a client only knows if
a domain supports DKIM when the DKIM signature header
is included in a received email. An attacker who wants to
spoof the email address of a domain that uses DKIM can
send an email message without the DKIM signature header.
The recipient checks the email headers, and if it does not
find a DKIM signature header, it leads to the assumption
