### Handling the Event and Its Impact on Costs

The manner in which an event is handled significantly influences the overall cost. Conversely, security breaches, as noted in [131], have a negative impact on the stock prices of affected companies, particularly in the case of e-commerce firms and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### From Risk Assessment to Risk Prediction

A considerable body of research, frameworks, and methodologies has focused on assessing the risk of cyber attacks by explicitly defining their underlying causes and triggers. As shown in Table I, each row's first column specifies the particular action, vulnerability, or exploit that materializes the risk. While this assessment technique is well-established in other domains (e.g., industrial and financial), its effectiveness in a cyber context remains uncertain. This is because the evaluation is based on the current knowledge of system vulnerabilities and available exploits, which are continuously evolving. Furthermore, when major cyber incidents occur, their root causes and enabling factors are often unknown, complicating the risk assessment process.

The goal of prediction is to address these limitations by using a combination of risk indicators—measurable factors empirically proven to reflect risk across various experiments. For example, as indicated in Table I, younger users, frequent use of untrusted internet connections, and longer browsing sessions at night are good indicators of higher malware infection risk [26]. These indicators do not specify actions or incautious behaviors, such as clicking on a malicious banner or installing malicious software. Similarly, companies with misconfigured DNS services and expired certificates more frequently show signs of botnet activities, which are less likely in entities with properly configured systems [20].

These measurable indicators are correlated with risk but are not the direct cause. For instance, a driver's age is not the cause of car accidents, but it can be used to predict the likelihood of future events. By measuring these indicators, experts can estimate the probability of future security incidents.

### Historical Studies on Predicting Security-Related Events

Over the past two decades, few studies have explicitly focused on predicting security-related events. In 2001, Browne et al. proposed a simple formula for predicting certain types of incidents. Another traditional approach is to adapt software reliability growth models (SRG), commonly used by the reliability community to describe and predict the evolution of defects in software. For example, Condon et al. [139] demonstrated that specific classes of computer incidents can be modeled with SRG, while the total aggregated incident rate can be better approximated using time series [140].

In 2016, Edwards [141] found that the daily frequency of data breaches follows a negative binomial distribution and used this model to estimate the likelihood of similar future incidents. Maillart [142] discovered that the theft of personal information follows a power-tail distribution, which is robust across different sectors and organization sizes.

### Predicting New Vulnerabilities and Cyber Incidents

A significant body of work has aimed at predicting the occurrence of new vulnerabilities in software products [143]–[148]. However, it remains unclear how this information can translate into predictions of the likelihood of being attacked or compromised in the future. Bozorgi [24] used publicly available vulnerability databases to predict which vulnerabilities are likely to be exploited and how soon. In 2005, Schechter [137] explored the challenges of predicting cyber attacks and concluded that the quantitative approaches used in insurance and risk management have failed in the cybersecurity domain due to the lack of techniques to measure the security strength of software.

### Recent Advances in Prediction Techniques

Recent years have seen prediction techniques at the center of several studies aimed at assessing risk in various circumstances. In 2009, Bossler et al. [29] investigated the influence of different factors in predicting data losses from malware infections through a survey of 788 college students. Liu et al. [20] used external observable features to predict the likelihood of an organization suffering a cyber incident, achieving 90% accuracy with 10% false predictions. Thonnard et al. [22] discussed organizational and individual-level features correlated with the risk of spearphishing attacks. Sarabi et al. [21] built a predictor for cyber incidents using industry, business, and web visibility/population information. RiskTeller [25] leverages internal telemetry data to predict which machines are at risk of malware infection, achieving 95% accuracy. Yen et al. [26] used antivirus logs to infer the risk of hosts encountering malware in large enterprises. Canali et al. [27] assessed the extent to which a user's risk class can be predicted based on their web browsing behavior. Sharif et al. [28] used mobile users' browsing patterns and self-reported data to predict encounters with malicious pages over short and long periods.

### Summary of Prediction Efforts

Table II summarizes these prediction efforts, including the type of predicted events, the source of ground truth information, the adopted features, and the data sources. The table also indicates whether the ground truth and predictive features are extracted from internal sensors (Int) or external public information (Ext). The importance of this distinction will be discussed in Section VI.

### Predicting the Cost of Cyber Incidents

Few studies have focused on predicting the cost of cyber incidents and data breaches. Jacobs [149] proposed a regression model based solely on the number of compromised user records. Romanosky [150] introduced additional variables (including revenue and company type) and found that a 10% increase in firm revenues correlates with a 1.3% increase in the cost of an incident. The author also noted that the cost is ultimately related to the size of the company and the breach, rather than the malicious nature of the incident or its outcome.

### Discussion

Today, cyber risk management methodologies, results of game theoretical studies, and scenario-based simulations are key components in the development of the cyber-insurance market. Companies and individuals adopting cyber insurance can benefit from these frameworks and guidelines, even though they were not initially designed for the insurance market. Insurance carriers also use these tools during contract underwriting to assign a value to an entity's risk and compute premiums for cyber-insurance policies [37].

However, all available solutions have a qualitative foundation, relying on expert knowledge and previous experience, lacking real-world feedback and measurable quantities. Existing methodologies use checklists, worksheets, knowledge bases, and what-if reasoning to identify threats and hazards. The quality of these analyses depends on the quality of the documents and the expertise of the analysts. Tools like fault trees, HAZOP, and FMEA studies assume detailed knowledge of the areas, operations, and processes exposed to hazardous events. The absence of objective measures and the qualitative nature of these methodologies make it difficult to obtain an accurate likelihood of a given threat in a cyber context. Additionally, the sheer number of risk assessment methodologies makes it unclear which one is best suited for the cyber domain, especially with the increasing adoption of IoT devices, for which new risk metrics and evaluation methods are still needed [151].

### From Theory to Practice

Research in the cyber-insurance domain has primarily focused on theoretical studies (from a mathematical viewpoint) and the analysis of cost-benefit tradeoffs (from an economic viewpoint). The system security community has largely ignored this emerging area, possibly due to a lack of awareness. We believe that the contribution of system security researchers can help develop quantitative, practical solutions to support the cyber-insurance market.
