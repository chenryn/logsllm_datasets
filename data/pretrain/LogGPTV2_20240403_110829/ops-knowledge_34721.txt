Question: "You are tasked with setting up a build environment for Trusty on an arm64 device. After installing the necessary tools and repositories, which of the following sets of steps would correctly compile the Trusty TEE image?"
 "A": "Create a directory named trusty, initialize the repo with the Trusty manifest from the AOSP, synchronize the repo, and use the provided build script for a generic arm64 image."
 "B": "Install the Trusty repositories directly without using Repo, build using the standard make command, and the lk.bin will be found in the root directory."
 "C": "Initialize the repo with the Trusty manifest from an unofficial source, perform a recursive clone, and use a makefile to build the generic arm64 image."
 "D": "Download the prebuilt lk.bin image directly from the AOSP without building, as building from source is not supported for arm64 devices."
Answer: A
