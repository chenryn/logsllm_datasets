For automating the deployment of various server applications—such as web, socket, and daemon services—that utilize a range of technologies (e.g., different databases and programming languages), there are several tools and methodologies to consider. Given that your team currently uses Python, Java, and Ruby, and may expand to other languages in the future, it's important to choose a solution that is flexible and can handle a diverse technology stack.

### Recommended Tools and Approaches

1. **Puppet**:
   - **Use Case**: Puppet is an excellent choice for managing server setup, configurations, and deployments. It provides a robust framework for defining infrastructure as code.
   - **Your Experience**: You mentioned using Puppet to manage all server setups, configurations, and deployments, and triggering new versions with Python Fabric scripts. This is a solid approach, as Puppet excels in ensuring consistency across environments, and Fabric can handle more dynamic and scriptable tasks.

2. **Ansible**:
   - **Use Case**: Ansible is another popular configuration management tool that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It uses YAML-based playbooks to define tasks and can manage a wide variety of servers and applications.
   - **Flexibility**: Ansible supports multiple languages and can be extended with custom modules, making it a good fit for a polyglot environment.

3. **Jenkins**:
   - **Use Case**: Jenkins is a powerful continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool that can automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
   - **Integration**: Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins that support various languages and technologies, including Python, Java, and Ruby. It can integrate with version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

4. **Maven**:
   - **Use Case**: While Maven is primarily used for Java projects, it can be extended with plugins to handle other languages and deployment tasks.
   - **Limitations**: However, Maven might not be the best choice for a polyglot environment, as it is more tightly integrated with the Java ecosystem. For a more language-agnostic solution, other tools like Jenkins or Ansible might be more appropriate.

### Summary
Given your current setup and the potential for future expansion, **Puppet** combined with **Python Fabric** is a strong choice. It allows you to manage both the static configurations and the dynamic deployment tasks effectively. If you need a more integrated CI/CD pipeline, **Jenkins** is also a highly recommended option. **Ansible** is another versatile tool that can complement or replace Puppet, depending on your specific needs and preferences.
