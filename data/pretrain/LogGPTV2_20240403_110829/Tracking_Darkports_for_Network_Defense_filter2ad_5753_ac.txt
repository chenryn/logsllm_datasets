### Activity Analysis and False Negatives

We used Snort's output as a baseline to assess the scanning activity within the dataset. Our analysis identified all scans that Snort detected, plus an additional 461 scans that Snort missed. Therefore, relative to Snort, our analysis for exposure maps (Table 2) revealed no false negatives.

**Exposure Maps and Authorized Access:**

Exposure maps, once vetted against the security policy, define the authorized access to the network from external sources. Any connection attempts or scans outside these maps are considered potential scans. Scans directed at a port/IP combination listed in the Network Exposure Map (NEM) are not classified as scans but rather as connection attempts to valid services. This could potentially lead to false negatives, as it would require knowledge of the intent behind the connection request. For example, a scan on port 443 of host 10.0.0.2 in the CCSL network would not be recorded as a scan. In practice, while this specific event might not be detected, the overall scanning campaign would likely be detected using exposure maps, as scans against other hosts not offering SSL (i.e., darkports) would be more apparent. However, if the scanning activity is solely directed at the HTTP server, it would remain undetected, leading to false negatives. We do not claim that exposure maps can detect attacks that are not preceded by scans.

### False Positives

False positives can occur due to user error or misconfiguration, where a connection attempt is made to a host or service not offered by the network. Despite the intent being to access a legitimate service, such activity would be classified as a scan because it involves a connection attempt to a host/port pair not listed in the NEM. While no false positives were observed in our CCSL dataset test (compared to 57 by Snort), we do not claim this will always be the case. False positives will arise when new legitimate services are introduced or when services not accessed during the training period are utilized. These would be identified as trans-darkports until the service is added to the vetted NEM. We expect trans-darkports to be infrequent in tightly controlled enterprise environments, such as government, financial, and healthcare sectors.

### Advanced Scanning Detection Using Exposure Maps

The scanning detection application identifies connection attempts to darkports within a network. A 5-tuple is extracted from each atomic scan event and recorded in a log file, from which heuristics can be developed to classify and correlate these events into respective scanning campaigns. Here are some examples of such heuristics:

#### Table 3: Three Detected Distributed Scans
| # of Scanners | Scanned Ports | # of Hosts Scanned | Follow-on Attack |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 3             | 80            | 62                 | No               |
| 11            | 22            | 62                 | Yes              |
| 9             | 25, 53        | 62                 | Yes              |

**Distributed Scanning Heuristics:**

1. **Scanning Events and Target Destination Ports:**
   - The number of scanning events per unique source IP address is determined over a configurable time interval.
   - Similar amounts of scanning events from individual sources are grouped into clusters, which are then grouped by target destination ports.
   - Clusters of three or more scanning sources targeting the same destination ports are considered distributed scans. The number of systems in a cluster is configurable.

2. **Source IP Proximity and Target Destination Ports:**
   - Scanning events are sorted by unique source IP address.
   - Scanning sources in the same one-quarter class C subnet address range (e.g., /26) are grouped into a cluster.
   - These clusters are then grouped by target destination ports.
   - Clusters of three or more scanning sources targeting the same destination ports are considered distributed scans.

Using these heuristics, we detected three distributed scans in the CCSL network dataset (see Table 3). The first involved three source IPs targeting port 80 (HTTP) across the entire CCSL network (62 systems). No follow-on attacks were detected. The second involved 11 systems targeting port 22 (SSH), with two hosts in the CCSL network offering SSH services. Two of the scanning systems attacked both systems. The third involved nine systems targeting ports 53 (DNS) and 25 (SMTP), with attacks following on the system offering port 25.

### Results: Active Response

Of the 813 scanners detected by the NEM in the CCSL dataset, 66 launched a total of 15,301 scans intermingled with unsuccessful attacks against the network. These included repeated attempts to relay mail through the mail server and attempted logins to an SSH service. Some systems scanned and attacked multiple services, explaining why the number of scan/attack entities in Table 4 is 121, while the actual number of unique IP addresses was 66. With the exception of a single distributed scan, the activity followed two patterns: (1) scanning was always the precursor to the attack, and (2) whenever a scan was directed at a service offered by the network, an attack followed after a response to the scan. This "scan then attack" behavior fits the profile of autorooter or worm activity. The attacks targeted four services: SMTP, HTTP, SSL, and SSH.

#### Table 4: Scan Activity as Prelude to Attack
| NEM Entry         | Scan/Attack Entities | Scans or Attacks |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 10.0.0.1:25       | 5                    | 5                |
| 10.0.0.1:80       | 12                   | 18               |
| 10.0.0.1:443      | 3                    | 3                |
| 10.0.0.2:22       | 40                   | 4,545            |
| 10.0.0.2:80       | 17                   | 120              |
| 10.0.0.2:443      | 4                    | 9                |
| 10.0.0.3:22       | 40                   | 10,601           |

Without the knowledge of active services, a standard perimeter defense might block all 813 scanning system source IPs. The NEM provides up-to-date information, indicating that only 66 source IP addresses need to be blocked, representing a 92% reduction in dynamic updates to the network security ACLs.

### Scalability and Stability of Exposure Maps

The size of exposure maps depends on the number of distinct hosts and the variety of applications they use. The smaller the NEM, the less detection system state is needed, enhancing scalability.

**Resource Consumption:**

- **System Detection State:** Storage for features extracted from network events must be maintained in main memory. Techniques like connection timeouts, reduced monitoring windows, and fixed-sized memory buffers help limit resource usage.
- **Disk Storage:** Disk storage usage increases with the number of atomic scan events recorded. For the CCSL dataset, storing 780,885 atomic scan events required 33MB, and a year of scanning activity would require approximately 391MB, easily stored on a CD or USB key.

**Automated Response:**

The automated response application requires more system detection state due to the scanners list. Each entry in the scanners list requires 4 bytes. An additional lookup is needed to check both the NEM and the scanners list. For 831 scanners, an additional 4KB of system detection state is sufficient. Over time, the scanners list must be managed to avoid exceeding system limits.

**Stability:**

The stability of the NEM varies by environment. In a tightly controlled enterprise network, the NEM stabilizes quickly. In more open environments, the NEM may stabilize more slowly due to frequent changes in hosts and services.
