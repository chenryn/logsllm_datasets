Hello everyone,
I came across an issue where I cannot build for android platform without
having a complete iOS toolchain. This happens when I start working with third
party plugins such as google_sign_in and firebase_auth.  
After importing a plugin in 'pubspec.yaml' file and run 'flutter package get',
the process fails with a following error:
`xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer
directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools
instance`
Is there a way to disable ios toolchain for someone who just wants to work
with android platform because installing Xcode is not an option to everyone
especially if you are on an old Macbook. By the way Im running macOS 10.11.
(and upgrading is not an option).
Happy Hacking everyone!!!
