User: I've been trying to compile a game I'm writing with python into an exe with cx_Freeze so my friends can play it without the python interpreter. However, when I run the "build" command through cmd, I get an error saying "ImportError: No module named 'cx_Freeze'". I've done this every way in and out, changing the capital letters in "cx_Freeze". I'm trying to use 3.4.3/3.5.1, and I'm using cx_Freeze version 4.3.4.  
Thanks in advance...
in answer to Lo√Øc's comment: yes, it is installed.
Assistant: Copy to the directory of the file to compile the following:

re.py
sre_compile.py
sre_constants.py
sre_parse.py

from "...\Lib"
and build: python <nameFileToBuild>.py build
