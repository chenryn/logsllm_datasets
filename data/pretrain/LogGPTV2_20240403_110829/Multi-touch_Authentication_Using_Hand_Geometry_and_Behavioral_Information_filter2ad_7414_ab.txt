touch behavior is believed to be a rich source of biometric data 
which implicitly contains information of hand shape [14]. For 
example,  when  a  user  performs  five  finger  pinches  or  four 
finger  swipes,  the  traces  of  touch  contains  information  of 
lengths of the fingers of the user. However, it is difficult for a 
user  to  keep  his  hand  shape  unchanged  when  performing 
normal  touch  gestures.  He  may  bend  his  fingers  in  one 
execution while stretch his fingers in another. This leads to

Fig. 1. Examples of TFST gestures 
changes  in  hand  posture  and  variations  in  multi-touch 
operations,  which  in  turn  affects  the  performance  of 
authentication  using  multi-touch  behaviors.  So  in  order  to 
achieve better performance of multi-touch authentication, we 
put some restrictions on hand postures which will not affect 
the user experience while leading to a closer correspondence 
between the multi-touch traces and hand geometry. 
A.  Touch Gesture Design 
We introduce a specific set of multi-touch gestures with 
some restrictions on hand postures, which makes multi-touch 
traces more closely related to physiological features in hand 
geometry. 
Definition  1.  TFST  Gestures:  A  set  of  multi-touch 
gestures performed with fingers straight and together. TFST 
is the abbreviation for “Touching with Fingers Straight and 
Together”. 
TFST gestures are a specific set of multi-touch gestures 
performed  by  adjacent  fingers  of  one  hand.  As  shown  in 
Figure 1, TFST gestures can be performed with two, three or 
four adjacent fingers of one hand. A TFST gesture may be a 
simple  swipe  or  a  relatively  complex  pattern  like  “Z”. 
Actually,  in  TFST  gestures,  patterns  of  touch  are  not 
restricted; the only restriction is that users are required to keep 
fingers  straight  and  together  while  performing  multi-touch 
operations.  
There  are  two  significant  advantages  of  TFST  gestures 
when used for multi-touch authentication. Firstly, when users 
perform TFST gestures, they must stretch their fingers and put 
them together. This makes the hand posture conform to a fixed 
hand  geometry,  which  leads  to  a  more  stable  behavioral 
pattern. 
Secondly, TFST  gestures require  fingers to  be together, 
which  requires  much  less  touch  area than traditional  multi-
touch operations. So multi-touch authentication using TFST 
gestures can be deployed on smaller screen devices such as 
smartphones,  while  previous  work  of  multi-touch 
authentication  [14]  can  only  be  deployed  on  large-screen 
tablets.  For  example,  two  or  three  finger  TFST  can  be 
performed on 4 inch touch screen (Figure 1a and 1b) and 4-
finger TFST gesture can be performed on horizontal 5.3 inch 
screen (Figure 1c).  
B.  Features in TFST Gestures 
1) Multi-touch Traces: When fingers are sliding on a touch 
screen, the screen will sample the positions of fingers under a 
certain frequency and report the information in the form of 
touch  events.  For  example,  Samsung  Note  1  (N7000)

instant gives a set of values for the 12 physiological features. 
In our study, we use the average values for the calculation of 
the 12 physiological features for a multi-touch trace. 
While we can have 12 measurements of hand geometry in 
the multi-touch trace of 4-finger TFST gesture, in the multi-
touch trace of a 2-finger TFST gesture as shown in Figure 1a, 
we will only have 3 measurements of hand geometry: d1, d4 
and AB. In the multi-touch trace of a 3-finger TFST gesture 
as shown in Figure 1b, we will have 7 measurements: d1, d2, 
d4, d5, AB, AC and BC.  
there 
features, 
As the user is required to perform multi-touch operations 
with fingers straight and together, the 12 measures of his hand 
geometry  are  basically  unchanged  each  time  he  performs  a 
TFST gesture. So the physiological features of TFST gestures 
are relatively stable and will provide consistent information 
for identity verification. 
3)  Behavioral  Features  in  TFST  Gestures:  Except 
physiological 
are  many  behavioral 
characteristics in TFST gestures, such as velocity and pressure 
of touching, and shape of the traces. The behavioral features 
are defined as the following: 
•  Length: Length is an important aspect for strokes in a 
multi-touch trace. We defined 3 length-related features 
for a stroke: distance (length of a stroke), displacement 
(displacement between the starting and ending points 
of a stroke) and ratio of displacement to distance. 
•  Time: Time is another important aspect of a stroke. We 
defined  1  time-related  feature  for  a  stroke:  duration 
(the duration of touch corresponding to a stroke). 
•  Velocity: Velocity reflects how fast a user swipes on 
the screen. We defined 1 velocity-related feature for a 
stroke:  velocity  (the  mean  velocity  of  the  sliding 
procedure). 
•  Tool: The tool sequence consists of tool area size for 
each touch point in a stroke and relates to the size of 
the touching finger. We defined 2 tool-related features 
for a stroke: tool mean (the mean of the tool sequence) 
and tool deviation (the standard deviation of the tool 
sequence). 
•  Touch:  Touch  describes  the  touch  area  size  of  each 
touch  point  on  the  screen.  Similar  with  tool,  we 
defined  2  touch-related  features  for  a  stroke:  touch 
mean  (the  mean  of  the  touch  sequence)  and  touch 
touch 
deviation  (the  standard  deviation  of 
sequence). 
•  Pressure: The pressure shows how hard a user touches 
the  screen.  It  is  relevant  with  Tool  and  Touch.  We 
defined  2  pressure-related  features  for  a  stroke: 
pressure mean (the mean of the pressure sequence) and 
pressure  deviation  (the  standard  deviation  of  the 
pressure sequence). 
•  Angle: We defined the angle between the horizontal 
line  and  the  connecting  line  of  two  adjacent  touch 
points in a stroke. Angle reflects the shape of a stroke 
and we defined 2 angle-related features for a stroke: 
angle mean (the mean of the angle sequence) and angle 
deviation  (the  standard  deviation  of 
the  angle 
sequence).

performs touch sampling at a rate of 60Hz and reports roughly 
60 touch events per second. The series of touch events record 
the moving traces of touching fingers in a multi-touch gesture, 
which are referred to as a multi-touch trace for the gesture. 
We refer to the touching trajectory of one finger in a multi-
touch trace as a stroke. A touch event contains information of 
the  XY-coordinates,  touch  pressure,  tool  major  and  touch 
major of each finger and the timestamp. Tool major and touch 
major are related to finger size and touching area according to 
official Android development documents. 
2) Physiological Features in TFST Gesture: As shown in 
Figure 2a, we define 12 distances of the touch trace for a 4-
finger TFST gesture: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, d1, d2, d3, 
d4, d5 and d6, as physiological features of TFST gestures. A, 
B, C and D are any set of touch points of the 4 fingers at the 
same  instant  in  the  trace.  With  respect  to  edges  of  the 
touchscreen, d1, d2 and d3 are horizontal distances between 
strokes of the multi-touch gesture; while d4, d5 and d6 are 
vertical distances between strokes of the multi-touch gesture. 
We assign a feature number from 1-12 to AB, AC, AD, BC, 
BD , CD, d1, d2 ,d3, d4, d5 and d6 respectively. 
Let’s assume a user performs the TFST gesture with the 
directions  of  his  fingers  parallel  to  one  edge  of  the 
touchscreen, which is the most natural way to perform TFST 
gestures.  Then  the  12  physiological  features  are  good 
measurements  of  corresponding  features  of  hand  geometry. 
As shown in Figure 2, the distances of d1, d2 and d3 in Figure 
2a are good estimations of finger distances of d1', d2' and d3' 
in Figure 2b. The distances of d4, d5 and d6 are estimations 
of finger length differences of d4', d5' and d6'. The 6 distances 
of  AB,  AC,  AD,  BC,  BD  and  CD  estimate  the  6  fingertip 
distances of A'B', A'C', A'D', B'C', B'D' and C'D'. 
Ideally,  in  the  multi-touch  trace  of  a  4-finger  TFST 
gesture, any set of touch points of the 4 fingers at the same

In  total,  we  have  13  behavioral  features  for  one  stroke. 
Thus,  there  are  52  behavioral  features  for  a  4-finger  TFST 
gesture, 39 for a 3-finger TFST gesture, and 26 for a 2-finger 
TFST gesture. 
C.  Data Collection 
To investigate the performance of TFST gestures in multi-
touch  authentication,  we  applied  and  received  an  approval 
from  the  institutional  review  board  of  Xian  Jiaotong 
University.  We  recruited  161  subjects  and  asked  them  to 
perform  various  TFST  gestures.  We  collected 
their 
corresponding  multi-touch  traces  to  establish  a  multi-touch 
authentication  dataset.  The  data  collection  lasted  for  more 
than 2 months. Each subject was asked to come every week in 
this period to support collecting behavioral variances.  
1)  Data  Collection  Environment:  We  developed  an 
Android application on a smartphone to collect TFST gesture 
data.  Only  one  smartphone  was  used  to  eliminate  the 
confounding  factors  introduced  by  changing  software  and 
hardware  environments.  The  smartphone  was  Samsung 
Galaxy N7000 (Note 1,1280×800 resolution) with a 5.3-inch 
screen, 1.4 GHz dual-core processor, and 1GB of RAM. The 
application  installed  on  the  smartphone  was  a  touch  data 
collector  for  users  to  perform  TFST  gestures.  Traces  of 
touching fingers were displayed on screen as visual feedback. 
Each subject was asked to perform the TFST gestures with his 
right hand.  
Subjects  were  requested  to  perform  horizontal,  vertical 
and L-swipe TFST gestures and datasets were established for 
2,  3  and  4  fingers  respectively.  We  did  not  employ  more 
complex gestures because the behavioral differences between 
users  when  performing  complex  gestures  may  be  more 
specific to this particular gesture itself, while the differences 
exhibited in performing simple gestures are more likely to be 
gesture-nonspecific, which are more objective to demonstrate 
the performance of TFST gestures.  
2)  Subjects and Dataset: We recruited 161 subjects. 131 
of them were sophomores aged from 18 to 20. 18 were master 
and PhD students aged from 23 to 30. And 12 were faculty 
members  or  staffs  on  campus  aged  from  30  to  55.  The 
sophomores participated in the experiment as a requirement 
for a course. They have been informed that their grades and 
course  credits  had  no  relations  with  the  data  collection 
process. The data collection process would provide them the 
data to be analyzed using the knowledge taught in the course. 
The grading was solely based on the programs they wrote to 
analyze  the  data.  The  rest  of  subjects  were  recruited 
voluntarily. Totally, the subjects consisted of 26 females and 
135 males. All were frequent smartphone users with at least 1 
year experience using a touch screen. These subjects may be 
considered  as  a  convenience  sample  [20].  However,  we 
decided to focus this study on experienced touchscreen users 
since  touchscreen  operations  are  easy  to  learn  and  it  is  not 
difficult to become an experienced user. 
A 7-session data collection lasted for more than 2 months. 
Each time  the  subject  finished  a  session,  at  least one  week 
passed  before  the  next  session.  The  time  interval  between 
sessions was set to be more than one week to guarantee that 
behavior variability with respect to time was captured in data 
Fig. 3. Example of a subject’s hand image 
collection procedure. In each session, subjects were asked to 
perform each TFST gesture over 20 times. The first session 
allowed subjects to become familiar with the gestures and the 
data were not analyzed. There were 6 experimental sessions, 
namely session 1 to session 6.  
Most  subjects  completed  the  6  sessions.  In  total,  we 
collected  more  than  15000  samples  for  each  TFST  gesture 
from  161  subjects  after  deleting  the  erroneous  samples.  It 
requires 0.3 ~ 1.8 seconds to perform our TFST gestures, with 
an average of 0.75 seconds for all subjects.  
In  the  data  collection  process,  we  also  collected  hand 
image  data  from  144  out  of  the  161  subjects  to  provide  a 
supporting dataset for feature analysis of the multi-touch data. 
IV.  FEATURE ANALYSIS 
In this section we will analyze the basis for multi-touch 
authentication using TFST gestures and utilize Fisher Score as 
a  feature  analysis  method  to  evaluate  behavioral  and 
physiological features together. 
A.  Discernibility of Physiological Features in TFST 
Gestures 
The  discernibility  of  physiological  features  in  TFST 
gestures are rooted from the discernibility of hand geometry. 
In  this  section,  we  will  analyze  the  discernibility  of  real 
features of hand geometry at first, and then demonstrate its 
connection  to  the  physiological  features  in  TFST  gestures 
experimentally. 
1)  Real  Features  of  Hand  Geometry:  Ross  shows  that 
hand  geometry  of  different people  shows  discernibility  and 
can be used as a good source of identity verification [21]. The 
12 physiological features of TFST gestures are estimates of 
the 12 real features of hand geometry as depicted in Figure 2. 
In the following experiment, we will show the 12 real features 
of hand geometry have the discernibility to authenticate users.  
In  the data collection  process,  we  collected  hand  image 
data on the coordinate paper from 144 subjects using distance 
fixed camera as shown in Figure 3. Each subject contributes 
21 to 24 hand image samples. We performed rotations to make 
the directions of hands parallel to the horizontal axis on the 
paper  and  manually  labelled  the  fingertip  positions  on  the 
image. We calculated values of the 12 real features of hand 
geometry  for  each  hand  image  as  a  sample  of  real  hand 
geometry  for  one  subject.  Thus  each  subject  has  21  to  24 
samples  and  in  total,  we  have  3240  samples  for  all  144 
subjects. 
By  assuming  a  Gaussian distribution,  we  built  a  simple
