### Program Errors in IBM MQ

Program errors in IBM MQ can originate from either user application code or IBM MQ code. These errors are categorized into two types:

1. **User-Detected Errors**
2. **Subsystem-Detected Errors**

#### User-Detected Errors

**Definition:**
User-detected errors are identified by the user or a user-written application when the results of a service request do not meet expectations (e.g., a non-zero completion code).

**Characteristics:**
- Detection occurs after the IBM MQ function has completed.
- Automated collection of problem determination data is not possible due to the timing of detection.
- Rerunning the application with the IBM MQ user parameter trace facility activated can provide necessary diagnostic data. This trace output is directed to the Generalized Trace Facility (GTF).

**Control:**
- The trace can be turned on and off using an operator command. For more information, refer to "Tracing on z/OS" on page 395.

#### Queue Manager Detected Errors

**Types of Errors:**
- **Program Check:** A program check error.
- **Data Set Filling Up:** When a data set is full.
- **Internal Consistency Error:** An internal consistency issue.

**IBM MQ's Response:**
- **User or Application Error:**
  - If the error is caused by a user or application (e.g., invalid address usage), IBM MQ reflects the error back to the application via completion and reason codes.
- **System Error:**
  - If the error is not caused by a user or application (e.g., all available DASD is used, or an internal inconsistency is detected), IBM MQ attempts to recover:
    - By sending completion and reason codes to the application.
    - If recovery is not possible, by stopping the application.
- **Unrecoverable Error:**
  - If IBM MQ cannot recover, it terminates with a specific reason code. An SVC dump is typically taken, recording information in the System Diagnostic Work Area (SDWA) and Variable Recording Area (VRA). An entry is also made in SYS1.LOGREC.

### IBM MQ for z/OS Abends

Abends can occur in WebSphere for z/OS or other z/OS systems. Understanding IBM MQ system abend codes and how to investigate abends in CICS, IMS, and z/OS is crucial.

#### IBM MQ for z/OS Abend Completion Codes

IBM MQ for z/OS uses two system abend completion codes: X'5C6' and X'6C6'. These codes indicate:

- **X'5C6':**
  - **Explanation:** Internal error during normal operation.
  - **System Action:** 
    - The internal IBM MQ task is abended.
    - The connected user task is abended.
  - **Diagnostic Information:**
    - SVC dump
    - SYS1.LOGREC
    - VRA data entries
  - **Associated Reason Codes:**
    - IBM MQ abend reason code
    - Associated z/OS system codes

- **X'6C6':**
  - **Explanation:** Severe error; continued operation might jeopardize data integrity.
  - **System Action:**
    - The entire IBM MQ subsystem is abended.
    - A user task with an active IBM MQ connection might be abnormally terminated with an X'6C6' code.
    - Possible MEMTERM (memory termination) of connected allied address space.
  - **Diagnostic Information:**
    - SVC dump
    - SYS1.LOGREC
    - VRA data entries
  - **Associated Reason Codes:**
    - Subsystem termination reason code
    - z/OS system completion codes and X'5C6' codes that precede the X'6C6' abend
