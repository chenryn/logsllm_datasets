User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题MDBDATA log folder is full, MDBDATA backup keeps failing Our MDBDATA log folder has gotten full and it's causing users outlook to lose connection. To remedy the problem my co-worker suggested that we move old logs onto our D: drive since it's not being used. Now the D: drive is starting to get full. I've tried to run the MDBDATA backup but after awhile it fails. I'm not the best when it comes to Exchange server but could it be our old logs are moved onto another HDD? Any suggestions on what I can do?

Assistant: You have two choices:


Perform a full backup using an Exchange-aware backup utility (like NTBackup). This will flush the transaction logs.
Enable circular logging on the storage group.


It's unclear to me why you can't get a backup to complete. More to the point, it's unclear to me that you're even bothering with backups. That's scary.

If you're not going to perform regular backups with an Exchange-aware backup program and/or the database (EDB / STM files) are on the same volume as the transaction logs then you might as well just switch into circular logging mode. You lose the ability to do point-in-time recovery and incremental/differential backups but it sounds like you don't particularly care about that anyway.

You're one database corruption away from losing all your Exchange data if you're not performing proper backups.
