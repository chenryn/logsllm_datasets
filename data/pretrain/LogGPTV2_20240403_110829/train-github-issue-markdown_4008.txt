When using the following string:
      query = "INSERT INTO `#{testTable}` ( d_id, job_id, created_at, updated_at, first_name, last_name, phone, zip, start_time, duration, recording ) VALUES ( #{d.id}, #{job.id}, '#{escapeIt(body.start_time)}', '#{escapeIt(body.start_time)}', '#{escapeIt(body.first_name)}', '#{escapeIt(body.last_name)}', '#{escapeIt(body.caller_id)}', '#{escapeIt(d.zip)}', '#{escapeIt(body.start_time)}', #{escapeIt(body.call_duration)}, '#{escapeIt(recording)}' )"
and selecting Coffeescript for the syntax highlighting, it thinks I have an
open string somewhere in that line. When I go to the next line, my syntax
highlighting is still showing green like there's a string I haven't closed.
JS2Coffee and Coffeescript.org both say the code is valid, which leads me to
believe this is a bug.
