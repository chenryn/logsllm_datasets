The log message indicates an error where the attempt to bind a service to a specific port and IP address has failed because the address is already in use. The general pattern of this log can be described as follows:

```
error: Bind to port <port_number> on <IP_address> failed: Address already in use.
```

In your specific example, the port number is `22` and the IP address is `0.0.0.0`. The pattern can be generalized to:

```
error: Bind to port <port_number> on <IP_address> failed: Address already in use.
```

This pattern can be used to identify similar errors where a binding operation fails due to the specified address already being in use.
