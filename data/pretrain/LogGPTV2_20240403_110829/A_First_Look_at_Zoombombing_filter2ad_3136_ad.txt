C. Characteristics of zoombombing links
In this section we focus on what we can learn by analyzing
the zoombombing links, in particular whether they contain
information about the victim organizations and if they include
a password as a URL parameter.
Targeted organizations. We want to understand what orga-
nizations are victims of zoombombing. Two of the services
(Zoom and Webex) that we study allow organizations to set up
a subdomain that identiﬁes them (for example https://virginia.z
oom.us/j/123456789 to identify the University of Virginia on
Zoom and https://paciﬁcbuddhistacademy.my.webex.com for
the Paciﬁc Buddhist Academy). We ﬁnd that most zoombomb-
ing links posted on 4chan and Twitter are generic and do not
contain subdomains that are speciﬁc to any organization: only
12 links contain speciﬁc subdomains to 10 institutions, and
two links contain speciﬁc subdomains to one institution on
Twitter. In particular, we ﬁnd that 8 zoombombing links on
4chan belong to education institutions while there are none
on Twitter. One of these is a high school located in the US
(Evergreen PS in Washington), four are universities in the
US (e.g., Arizona State University), and three are universities
outside the US (e.g., Concordia in Canada). In Section VI-A
we will show that the text of zoombombing posts often further
identiﬁes the institution or organization that the zoombombing
link belongs to.
Password protection. As we discussed in Section II-B, two of
the ten online meeting services (Zoom and Webex) allow hosts
to protect their meetings using passwords. In the case of Zoom,
the password can be embedded in links as a URL parame-
ter (for example https://zoom.us/j/123456789?pwd=12345aA
bBcC678). We ﬁnd that 20 of the 123 bombing invitations on
4chan and 64 of the 95 on Twitter include a password. This is
interesting because having a password by default was added
by Zoom after the quarantine started, with the explicit goal
of curbing zoombombing. In fact, we ﬁnd that zoombombing
posts containing passwords are concentrated toward the latter
part of our timeline (see Figure 9). The week Zoom started
to enable passwords by default is shown in the ﬁgure with a

and non-bombing links on both Twitter and 4chan. To do this,
we look for the most similar words to “meetinglink” with
similarity deﬁned as the cosine similarity of the embedding
vectors of words in our trained models.
As seen in Table III, the most representative words for
zoombombing and non-bombing content are very different. On
4chan, we notice that most zoombombing words are related to
education (e.g., “lecture,” “class”) or business meetings (e.g.,
“meeting,” “conference”). On Twitter, we observe references to
education as well (“zoomclass”) as well as keywords related to
attacks (e.g., “raiding”). For non-bombing content, on Twitter
we observe that most keywords are related to conference
meetings, reﬂecting the fact that public meeting URLs are
often posted on the platform. On 4chan, we observe that
non-bombing meeting URLs are often related to trolling and
political discussion.
Visualizing discussion themes. We next aim to identify
recurring “themes” in zoombombing content. To this end, we
visualize the relationship between the words related to online
meeting links following the methodology of Zannettou et
al. [12]. From our trained word2vec models, we create a two-
hop ego network centered around “meetinglink” where words
are nodes, and edges are weighted with the cosine similarity
between the those two words; we keep any edge whose
weight is greater than or equal to a pre-deﬁned threshold, and
visualize this as a graph. For each graph, we elect the threshold
as the value that results in a graph with 100 nodes (for ease of
representation). We then detect communities of words using
the Louvain algorithm [4], and display them using Gephi’s
ForceAtlas2 algorithm [24].
Figures 10 and 11 show the results of this analysis for
zoombombing invitations in 4chan threads and Twitter posts,
respectively. Intuitively, each colored community can be in-
terpreted as a “theme” that features prominently in these
posts. Looking at the 4chan graph (Figure 10) we see that
many of the themes feature educational topics (e.g., the red
community with “spanish,” “course,” and “skype” and the
purple community with “university,” “college,” and “class”).
We also note a community (orange) where users talk about
security issues/conspiracies as we can infer from words like
“ccp,” “tiktok,” “spyware,” and “ban.” This indicates that
conspiratorial content is not only commonplace in regular
discussion on 4chan, but is also featured in zoombombing
content in particular. See the following post for example:
“If you do the research you’ll see our MSM is
in bed with the CCP. This is being utilized for
propaganda purposes just like tiktok. I work with
a bunch of regressed and they all love posting
on tiktok. The users of these applications have
close to zero foresight when it comes to Intel
collection in any fashion from any party. Kind of
we are fucked because Jews take chinese money
as investments in their companies.”
On Twitter (Figure 11) we again see themes that cover on-
line classes (e.g., the green community with “class,” “history,”
“math”). We also see a number of keywords used as hashtagsto
ensure calls for zoombombing obtain more visibility (e.g.,
“zoomcodeclass,” “zoombomb,” “zoomraids”).
For completeness, we report the graphs for non-bombing
threads on 4chan and non-bombing tweets on Twitter in
Figures 12 and 13 respectively. From the ﬁgures, we see the
themes in these cases are more varied. For example, on 4chan
we see a community of keywords related to World War II and
Nazi Germany, while on Twitter there is a community related
to research and webinars.
VI. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS: FORUM CONTENT
Our quantitative analysis highlighted several
interesting
aspects of zoombombing invitations and their discussion. In
particular, we found evidence that online classes in particular
are targeted by attacks, and we found several meeting pass-
words included in invitations, which could be an indicator
that attacks are called for by insiders who have legitimate
access to the meeting rooms. When dealing with online activity
carried out by humans, however, quantitative analysis can
only identify general trends, and lacks the nuance required
to provide a better understanding of the problem. In this
section, we answer deeper questions via a more thorough
qualitative analysis informed by our quantitative results. As
explained in Section IV we conduct this analysis by having
the four authors of the paper manually annotate the dataset.
Where appropriate, our analysis covers zoombombing posts
on Twitter and 4chan, while for some of the analysis (e.g.,
analyzing back and forth communication between attackers)
we rely only on 4chan threads. Based on our threat model (see
Section II-A), we analyze attacks across four phases: i) Call
for attack, ii) Coordination, iii) Delivery, and iv) Harm.
A. Phase I: Call for attack
In this phase, an attacker posts a call for an attack on an
online platform.
Targeting the class room. In Section V-C we showed that we
could quantitatively identify 8 academic institutions targeted
by zoombombing attacks on 4chan. In addition to information
that can be directly extracted from the URL of the bombing
link, many bombing posts include additional text indicating
that online classes are the target. For example, “lecture,”
“teacher,” “class,” etc. show up regularly in these threads.
We ﬁnd that 91 of our 123 zoombombing threads on 4chan
target online classes. Of the 32 remaining threads, three target
business meetings, and the target of the remainder could not
be conclusively determined. On Twitter, we ﬁnd that 56 of our
95 bombing calls target schools.
Evidence of insiders’ complicity. In Section V-C we showed
that 11 zoombombing links on 4chan include passwords, indi-
cating that the call for attack was from legitimate participant in
the meeting (e.g., a student in the class). When annotating the
threads, we ﬁnd 9 additional zoombombing threads including
a password in the body of messages. In total, this accounts for
20 of our 123 threads on 4chan. For Twitter, we showed that
64 of 95 tweets include a password in the zoombombing link.

There are additional indicators that can be used to qual-
