User: I'm getting ready to deploy an app on OS X. This is the first time I've written an application on this platform which requires root permissions to run properly, so I need that functionality integrated for every startup attempt.
The application itself is written in Python 2.7, and then compiled to binary using PyInstaller. So far, I've tried:

Running PyInstaller using sudo pyinstaller -w --icon=/path/to/icon /path/to/script.py
Invoking the PyInstaller command using sudo su

I don't know what else to try at this point. Is it something that could be achieved using symlinks?
Assistant: Running the installer as root will have no effect when you later start the application itself as a normal user.
Try sudo python /path/to/script.py instead.
If that works, then put this into a shell script and run that to start the app as root from now on (and the people who know MacOS can probably tell you how you can create a nice icon for the script).
