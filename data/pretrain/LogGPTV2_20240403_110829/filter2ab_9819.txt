### Title: Roaming Mantis at botconf2019: A Comprehensive Analysis of Android Botnets

In March 2018, a large-scale cybercriminal campaign known as "Roaming Mantis" compromised thousands of home routers in Japan. The attackers manipulated the DNS settings to redirect traffic to a rogue DNS server. This campaign was driven by strong financial motives and targeted a wide range of devices connected to the compromised routers, including Android smartphones, iOS devices, and personal computers.

The perpetrators have continuously refined their malicious content for each platform, demonstrating a high level of sophistication. Notably, the attackers developed their malware to support 27 different languages, indicating a global targeting strategy.

Our research aims to provide a detailed analysis of this campaign, including insights into the motivations of the criminals, an in-depth examination of the malicious content, and the methods used to compromise the routers. We hope that sharing this information will benefit the broader cybersecurity community, including researchers and CERTs.
