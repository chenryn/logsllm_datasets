User: What are CDNs? How does it affect website performance?
Assistant: CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a content distribution network, which is a network composed of servers distributed all over the world. It is used to distribute the static and dynamic content of the website to the server closest to the user to improve access speed and stability. CDN has the following effects on website performance: 1. Accelerate website loading speed: CDN distributes the static and dynamic content of the website to the server closest to the user, avoiding the delay of remote servers, shortening the transmission time, and accelerating the loading speed of the website. 2. Reduce server load: If all users request the same file on the server, the server load will be too high. After using CDN, user requests will be distributed to multiple servers, reducing the load on a single server. 3. Improve the reliability of the website: CDN will store the content of the website on multiple nodes. If a node fails, other nodes can replace it to ensure the availability of the website. In short, CDN can optimize website performance and improve user experience, and is one of the indispensable technologies for modern website construction.
