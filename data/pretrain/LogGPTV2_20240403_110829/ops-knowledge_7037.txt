User: We need to install and configure the Kubernetes container orchestration system on a set of servers and ensure high availability and scalability of the cluster.
Assistant: 1. First, we need to prepare a group of servers. It is recommended to use at least 3 servers to build a cluster, which can ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Each server should be configured with at least 2-core CPU, 8GB RAM, and 100GB storage. 2. Then, we need to install Docker because Kubernetes uses Docker as the container runtime. Install Docker on each server and start the service. 3. Next, we need to install and configure Kubernetes components on each server, including kubelet, kube-proxy, kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager. 4. Then, we need to install etcd on one of the servers to store the state data of the Kubernetes cluster. Make sure the etcd cluster is also highly available and fault tolerant. 5. Finally, we need to use the Kubeadm tool to initialize and deploy the Kubernetes cluster, and make necessary configurations and adjustments, such as network settings, storage configuration, authentication and authorization configuration, etc. During this process, you need to pay special attention to the security and network performance of the cluster, such as firewall settings, TLS certificate configuration, network plug-in selection, etc. In addition, in order to ensure the scalability of the cluster, it is necessary to use the horizontal expansion functions in Kubernetes, such as automatic scaling and container scheduling.
