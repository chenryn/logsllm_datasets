I have been testing the v1.1.0 tag and built a `hyperkube` binary. However, when I run it without any arguments, I encounter the following errors:

```
_output/local/go/bin/hyperkube 
W0930 17:57:47.051620     714 server.go:176] Failed to start in resource-only container "/kube-proxy": mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/perf_event/kube-proxy: read-only file system

```

I expected to see a usage message, but instead, none of the servers are functioning correctly. Upon further investigation, I discovered that adding the proxy server to `hk` causes it to fail, effectively breaking `hyperkube`. For more details, please refer to commit `1c25c2c`.

### Summary of Issues:
1. **Read-Only File System**: The `hyperkube` binary is unable to create a directory in the read-only file system.
2. **Missing Configuration**: The `--kubeconfig` or `--master` flags are not specified, leading to the use of a default API client, which may not work.
3. **iptables Not Found**: The `iptables` command is not found in the `$PATH`, causing initialization failures.
4. **Connection Refused**: The attempt to connect to the local Kubernetes API server at `http://localhost:8080` is refused.

### Suggested Actions:
1. Ensure the file system is writable for the necessary directories.
2. Specify the `--kubeconfig` or `--master` flags with the appropriate values.
3. Verify that `iptables` is installed and available in the `$PATH`.
4. Check the status and configuration of the local Kubernetes API server.

For further assistance, please provide additional context or logs.
