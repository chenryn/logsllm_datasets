I am testing out the v1.1.0 tag and built a hyperkube binary. However, running
it with no arguments is producing:
    _output/local/go/bin/hyperkube

I would have expected a usage message. None of the servers are working
correctly. After doing some more digging I found that when adding the proxy
server to `hk` is causing it to essentially boot up breaking hyperkube.
