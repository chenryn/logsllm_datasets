The icons from material-ui-icon have no TS typings, so there's no way to
import them without getting a (Could not find a declaration module for module
FOOBAR) warning.  
The only workaround is to use an old const AddIcon = require('material-ui-
icons/Add').default;
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Icons from the package should have a typing so TS doesn't generate a warning
when importing them.
## Current Behavior
Importing them generates a TS warning, having to resort to require
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
`import AddIcon from 'material-ui-icons/Add';`
