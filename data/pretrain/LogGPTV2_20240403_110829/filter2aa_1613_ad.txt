# Dating and Personality Insights

## Introduction
- **Dating!**
- Imagine being able to discern if a potential partner is high maintenance. By analyzing their Facebook posts and activities, we might be forewarned and better prepared to look for other clues.

## High Maintenance Indicators
- **Promiscuity:** If someone scores high in openness, they may have a desire to experience new things, which could extend to their relationships.
- **Players:** In Martin Amis's "The Rachel Papers," the main character, Charles Highway, adeptly adjusts his personality and approach based on his target.

## Enhancing Your Dating Profile
- Consider writing your dating profiles or emails and running them through a personality filter to make tweaks that will make you more attractive to your target audience. This could be an interesting research project, especially for those who are currently single.

## Sizing Up Potential Partners
- For some, assessing others is a natural skill.
- The odds generally work in our favor. We don't mind being wrong, but we should aim to be right more often.

## General Flow of Talk
- **Caveat:** Generally, you can only date someone who is within a +/- 2 range in terms of physical attractiveness, unless you have something else to offer, such as money, humor, or status.

- **Access Denied:** However, if you are conducting a romance scam, you wouldn't use your own pictures, giving you a new tool.
- **Scams and Gullibility:** Agreeableness is positively correlated with gullibility. A recent Cisco report highlights the increase in spear phishing. Using tools like Maltego by Paterva, we can sift through social media profiles to identify potentially gullible individuals, providing a head start in targeting the weakest points in a group.

## Social Engineering and Scammers
- **Sock Puppets:** Organizations use fake personas (sock puppets) to spread misinformation and sway public opinion. Tim Hwang's video, "Exterminate, Exterminate: On the Robotic Subjugation of Twitter," discusses this topic.
- **Untested Hypothesis:** You can give sock puppets specific personality traits and target people accordingly, either by focusing on gullible individuals or by tailoring the approach based on the target.

## Media and Research Misinterpretation
- **Facebook Profiles and Personality Traits:** An article from May 9th claimed that Facebook can predict personality, leading to the misinterpretation that employers can determine personality solely from Facebook. This is not accurate, and there are documented cases of personality misuse in the past.
- **Cyber Vetting:** If organizations start using personality in cyber vetting, it could lead to misuse, especially in sensitive contexts like drug experimentation and the Dark Triad (narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy).

## Potential Watch Lists
- **Personality Traits and Criminal Connections:** If you have certain personality traits, use specific words in your posts, or are connected to known criminals, you might end up on a watch list, presenting a threat to national security.

## Digital Age and Privacy
- **Leaving Your Past Behind:** In the digital age, your past actions and mistakes can follow you forever. To avoid scrutiny, you might consider:
  - Not using social media
  - Locking down privacy settings
  - Using different accounts or pseudonyms

## Drugs and Personality
- **Drugs and Personality Changes:** While there are no studies on how drugs like anti-depressants affect personality, it's an interesting area for research. However, we do not recommend taking drugs to meet societal norms.

## Societal Implications
- **Embracing Differences:** Shouldn't we embrace each other's differences rather than trying to conform to a norm?
- **Regulatory Control:** Tight controls on the use of personality data derived from social media could be implemented, with companies like Social Intelligence adding context and ensuring proper use.
