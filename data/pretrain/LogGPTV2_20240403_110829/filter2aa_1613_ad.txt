particularly interesting research project, perhaps for someoneʼs whoʼs currently single.

• we know that agreeableness is positively correlated with gullibility .
• Further,  a recent Cisco report talks about increase in spear phishing..
• So, imagine sifting through the (public) social media proﬁles of a group of peope with the help of Maltego by Paterva
• So what if we could ﬁnd people who may be more gullible than others, OR to put it another way, in rank order, who are the post pwnable people in a group.
• If youʼre looking for the weakest point in a group, this should give you a headstart.

•The research makes no such claim, but the media do and theyʼre wrong, In this case, the odds of being wrong matter a lot
•Now what happens if organizations start adding personality to cybervetting? We know personality has been misused in the past, thereʼs some well documented cases, so itʼs not 
unreasonable to suggest itʼll get added to cybervetting and itʼll be misused...
