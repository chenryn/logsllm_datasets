ABSTRACT
The Smart Energy Grid Security (SEGS) Workshop aims to
foster innovative research and discussion about smart energy
grid security and privacy challenges, issues, approaches, and
solutions. SEGS publications oﬀer perspectives from both
academia and industry, and present novel research on theo-
retical and practical aspects of smart grid security and pri-
vacy, including design, analysis, experimentation, and ﬁelded
systems. SEGS also includes presentations from other com-
munities, such as law, economics, and HCI, that present
these communities’ perspectives on technological issues. The
scope of the workshop encompasses all aspects of the smart
grid, including distribution, transmission, generation, me-
tering, e-mobility, and integration of distributed energy re-
sources.

INTRODUCTION
Smart grid security is an upcoming topic of great impor-
tance, but there is currently little understanding and com-
munication between the electricity sector and the security
community. The subject of smart grids has been discussed
in industry for many years now and smart meters have al-
ready been deployed in multiple countries around the world.

There are over 20 annual conferences and events sponsored
by utilities and leaders in the energy industry. However,
there is currently a large gap in the security research com-
munity speciﬁcally addressing smart grids. This workshop
aims to ﬁll that void and encourage more research into the
area of smart grid security by providing a forum for secu-
rity researchers to present their work. The workshop also
includes an invited speaker from the electricity sector who
will share his expertise with the audience and thus help in
guiding future research eﬀorts. This workshop serves as an
opportunity to foster collaboration between the power in-
dustry and the ACM CCS research community.
The SEGS Workshop focuses on the following topics:
2. TOPICS OF INTEREST
• Smart grid architectures and models
• Smart grid networks and communication
• Security and dependability in safety-critical, real-time sys-
tems
• Data protection and privacy
• Grid management
• Trust and assurance
• Intrusion detection and monitoring on smart grids
• Algorithms and protocols for critical infrastructures
• Risk and threat analysis
• Smart grid standards, testing, and certiﬁcation
• Testbeds and ﬁeld trials
• Usability and legal issues on grid security
• Cloud computing and smart grids
3. FORMAT
SEGS is a full-day workshop on the ﬁnal day of the ACM
CCS 2013 Conference. The program includes an invited
talk called ”The Future of Smart Grids”. The talk will be
given by an expert from the power industry, who can give
an insider view on the security issues, requirements, and
approaches taken right now and on the development of the
smart grid in the future. In addition to the invited talk, the
program is split into four sessions consisting of presentations
from six regular papers and six short papers.
