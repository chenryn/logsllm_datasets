User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Run antivirus software on linux DNS servers. Does it make sense? During a recent audit we were requested to install antivirus software on our DNS servers that are running linux (bind9). The servers were not compromised during the penetration testing but this was one of the recommendations given.


Usually linux antivirus software is installed to scan traffic
destined to users, so what's the goal to install antivirus on a dns
server?
What is your opinion on the proposal?
Do you actually run antivirus software on your linux servers?
If so, which antivirus software would you recommend or you are
currently using?

Assistant: Sometimes auditors are idiots...

This is uncommon request, though. I would counter the auditors recommendation by securing/limiting access to servers, adding an IDS or file-integrity monitoring or bolstering security elsewhere in your environment. Antivirus doesn't have any benefit here.

Edit:

As noted in the comments below, I was involved in the launch of a very high-profile website here in the US, and was responsible for designing the Linux reference architecture for HIPAA compliance.

When the matter of Antivirus came up for discussion, we did recommend ClamAV and an application firewall to process submissions from end-users, but managed to avoid having AV on all systems by implementing compensating controls (3rd-party IDS, session logging, auditd, remote syslog, two-factor auth to the VPN and servers, AIDE file-integrity monitoring, 3rd-party DB encryption, crazy filesystem structures, etc.). These were deemed acceptable by the auditors, and all was approved.
