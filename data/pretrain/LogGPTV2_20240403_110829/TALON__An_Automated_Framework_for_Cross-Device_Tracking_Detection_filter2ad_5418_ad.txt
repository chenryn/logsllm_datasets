highest in AUC, and also in Precision and Recall, whereas
persona 6 has poor performance compared to the rest. These
results indicate that for high scoring personas, we success-
fully captured the active CDT campaigns, but for the per-
sonas with lower scores, there may not be active campaigns
for the period of the experiments.
In order to retrieve the variables that affect the discovery
and measurement of CDT, we applied the feature importance
method on the dataset of each persona, and selected the top-
10 highest scoring features. For the majority of the personas
(7 out of 10) the most important features were the number
of ads (distinct or not) and the number of keywords in desk-
top. In some cases, there were also landing pages that had
high scoring (i.e., speciﬁc ad-campaigns), but this was not
consistent across all personas.
Combined Personas: Setup 1b. Here, we use all the
datasets collected individually, for each persona in the previ-
ous experiment (Setup 1a), and combine them into one uni-
ﬁed dataset. This setup emulates the real scenario of a user
exhibiting multiple and diverse web interests, that give ex-
tra information to the ad-ecosystem about their browsing be-
havior. Of course, there is an increase in the possible feature
space to accommodate all the domains and keywords from
all personas. In fact, the dataset contains 2021 features as it
stores the vectors of landing pages and keywords, for all the
different types of personas. In total, there were 890 distinct
ad-domains described by keywords in 76 distinct categories.
In this dataset, we apply feature selection with the Extra-
Trees classiﬁer to select the most relevant features and cre-
ate a more accurate predictive model. This method reduced
the feature space to 984 useful features out of 2201. Next,
we use the three classiﬁcation algorithms and a range of
hyper-parameters for each one. Also, we apply a 10-fold
nested cross-validation method for selecting the best model
(in terms of scoring performance) that can give us an ac-
curate, non overly-optimistic estimation [13]. Again, the

best selected model was Random Forest, with 200 estimators
(trees) and 200 depth of each tree, with AUC=0.89 (bottom
row in Table 2). The model’s performance is high in all the
mentioned scores, which indicates that the more diverse data
the advertisers collect, the easier it is to identify the different
user’s devices. This result is in line with Zimmeck et al. [56],
who attempted a threshold-based approach for probabilistic
CDT detection on real users’ data, lending credence to our
proposed platform’s performance.
We also measure the feature importance for the top-30 fea-
tures (shown in Figure 5). One third of the top features are
related to crawl speciﬁc metadata, whereas about half of the
top features are keyword-related. Interestingly, features such
as the day and time of the experiment, as well as the number
of received ads, are important for the algorithm to make the
classiﬁcation of the devices.
Indeed, time-related features
provide hints on when the ad-ecosystem receives the brows-
ing signal and attempts the CDT, and thus, which days and
hours of day the CDT is stronger. These results give support
to our initial decision to experiment in a continuous fashion
with regular sessions injecting browsing signal, while at the
same time measuring the output signal via delivered ads.
5.3 Does long-time browsing improve CDT?
Independent Personas: Setup 2a.
In this set of experi-
ments, we allow the devices to train for a longer period of
time, to emulate the scenario where a user is focused on a
particular interest, and produces heavy browsing behavior
around a speciﬁc category. This long-lived browsing injects
a signiﬁcantly higher input signal to the ad-ecosystem than
the previous setup, which should make it easier to perform
CDT. In order to increase the setup’s complexity, and make
it more difﬁcult to track the user, we allow all devices (i.e.,
1 mobile, 2 desktops) to train in the same way under the
same persona. In effect, this setup also tests a basic coun-
termeasure from the user’s point of view, who tries to blur
her browsing by injecting trafﬁc of the same persona from
all devices to the ad-ecosystem.
In this setup, while all devices are trained with the same
behavioral proﬁle, we examine if the statistical tests and ML
modeler can still detect and distinguish the CDT. This exper-
iment contains three different phases during each run. The
mobile phase, where the mobile performs training crawls for
ttrain=480 mins, and a testing crawl for ttest=30 mins. In par-
allel with the mobile training, the two desktops perform test
crawls for ttest=30 mins. After mobile training and testing,
both desktops start continuous training and testing crawls al-
ternately for 8 hours (ttrain=ttest=30 min).
Due to the long time needed for executing this experiment,
we focus on two personas constructed in the following way.
We use the methodology for persona creation as described
in § 4.1, and focus on active ad-campaigns, resulting to two
personas in the interest of “Online Shopping-Accessories”,
and “Online Shopping-Health and Fitness” (loosely match-
ing the personas 1 and 4 from Table 3). Then, we per-
formed 4 runs of 16 hours duration each, for each persona.
In this setup, since all devices are uniformly trained, we do
not include the keyword vector of the persona pages into the
datasets, to not introduce any bias from repetitive features.
The statistical analysis for this experiment reveals poten-
tial CDT, since we accept the null hypothesis for the dis-
tribution of ads delivered in the paired desktop and mobile
(lowest p-value=0.052), and reject it in the baseline desktop
and mobile (highest p-value=0.006). This consistency is in-
teresting, since for this setup all three devices are uniformly
trained with the same persona, and thus all of them collect
similar ads due to retargeting. However, there is no similar-
ity between the distributions of ads in the devices that do not
share the same IP address.
To clarify this ﬁnding, we applied the ML algorithms as in
the previous experiment. The algorithms again detect CDT
between the mobile and the paired desktop, even though all
devices were exposed to similar training with the same per-
sona. In fact, Logistic Regression performed the best across
both personas, with AUC ≥ 0.81, and F1-score ≥ 0.80 for
both classes.5 When computing the importance of features,
the desktop number of ads and keywords and the desktop
time slot are in the top-10 features. Based on these obser-
vations, we believe that the longer training time allowed the
ad-ecosystem to establish an accurate user proﬁle, and retar-
get ads on the paired desktop, based on the mobile’s activity.
Combined Personas: Setup 2b. Similarly to § 5.2 we
combine all data collected from the Setup 2a into a uniﬁed
dataset. Under this scenario, in which we mix data from both
personas, the classiﬁer again performs well, with AUC=0.89.
Important features in this case are the number of ads and key-
words delivered to the desktops, the time of the experiment,
and number of keywords for the desktop.
Boosted Browsing with CDT trackers and Independent
Personas: Setup 2c.
In the next set of experiments, we

measurement of CDT. In particular, we attempt to boost the
CDT signal, by visiting webpages with higher portion of
CDT trackers. Therefore, the experimental setup and the
preprocessing method remain the same as in the previous
Setup 2a, but we select webpages to be visited that have ac-
tive ad-campaigns and their landing pages embed the most-
known CDT trackers (as we also show in the next section):
Criteo, Tapad, Demdex, Drawbridge. We also change the
set of our control pages, so that each one contains at least
a CDT tracker. News sites have many 3rd-parties compared
to other types of sites [22]. Thus, for this boosted browsing
experiment, we choose the set of control pages to contain 3
weather pages and 2 news websites,6 while verifying they do
not serve contextual ads.
Performing the same analysis as earlier, we ﬁnd that mo-
bile and paired desktop have ads coming from the same dis-
tribution (lowest p-value=0.10), and that there is no simi-
larity between the ads delivered in the mobile and baseline
desktop (highest p-value=0.007). For a clearer investigation
of the importance of the CDT trackers, we also evaluate the
ﬁndings with the ML models. For persona 1, Logistic Re-
gression and Random Forest models perform near optimally,
with high precision of Class 1, high recall for class 0, aver-
age F1-Score=0.93 for both classes, and AUC=0.93. For per-
sona 4, the scores are even higher, outperforming the other
setups, as all metrics for Logistic Regression scored higher
than 0.98. Overall, these results indicate that we success-
fully biased the trackers to identify the emulated user in both
devices, and to provide enough output signal (ads delivered)
for the statistical algorithms to detect the CDT performed.
Boosted Browsing with CDT trackers and Combined
Personas: Setup 2d. We follow a similar approach with be-
fore, and combine all data collected from the Setup 2c, into
a uniﬁed dataset for Setup 2d. Under this scenario, the clas-
siﬁer (Logistic Regression) again performs very well, with
AUC=0.93. Important features in this case are the number
of ads delivered to the desktops, the time of the experiment
in each desktop and the number of keywords. Interestingly,
and perhaps unexpectedly, the existence of Criteo tracker in
a landing page, is a feature appearing in the top-10 features.
5.4 Does incognito browsing help evade CDT?
Independent Personas: Setup 3a. In this ﬁnal experimen-
tal setup, we investigate if it is possible for the user to apply
some basic countermeasures to avoid, or at least reduce the
possibility of CDT, by removing her browsing state in every
new session. For this, we perform experiments where the tra-
ditional tracking mechanisms (e.g., cookies, cache, browsing
history, etc.) are disabled or removed, emulating incognito
browsing. We select the ﬁrst ﬁve personas from Table 3,
