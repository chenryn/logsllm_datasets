WARNING: STATIC CONTENT
One of the overriding themes of this talk is that once a 
piece of data has been captured, it’s forever retrievable. In 
the  spirit of that principle, these made-for-CD slides have 
been watered down a little bit, in order to prevent any 
unintentional long-lived copyright violations, overly 
offensive topics or other goof ups .
Dynamic, up-to-date slides can be pulled from:

Abstract
•
How much data do you generate in the process of living an ordinary day? This talk 
covers various ways to gather, persist and analyze the data stream that is your life. 
We’ll cover a few of the approaches that are available today, some easy code you 
can whip up to persist anything you please, and what to expect from the 
community and businesses moving forward. Privacy/security impact is sure to be 
huge, so hold on to your hats, and start tracking and logging everything! 
Somebody else may be doing it for you already..

• What’s been done can’t be undone, son

forever
