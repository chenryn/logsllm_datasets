GetNotify (getnotify.com)
IntelTechniques IP Addresses Tool
IP Addresses 395
Similar to the domain tool mentioned previously, this page automates some of the most common IP address 
searches. The first box accepts any IP address. Clicking the Populate All button will insert this address into all 
the search options where manual queries can be conducted. The final option will open several tabs within your 
browser that present each query listed on the page. Figure 24.03 displays the current status of the service.
GetNotify tracks the opening of email messages and presents the connection information of the target. This 
sendee is completely free and does not require Gmail as your email provider. You will need to create an account 
through the Get Notify website and you will be limited to five email messages per day. After you have registered 
the email address you will be using, you can send emails from that account as usual. However, you will need to 
add ".getnotify.com" after each email recipient Instead of sending an email message to the valid account of 
PI:EMAIL, you would send the message to a modified email address of 
Michael@inteltechniques.com.gemotify.com. This will force the email message to go through Get Notify's 
servers and route the message to the valid address. When your target reads the email message, Get Notify will 
track the user's IP address, geographical location, and notify you whether your message was viewed for a length 
of time or deleted right away.
Get Notify works by adding a small invisible tracking image in your outgoing emails. When your email recipient 
opens your message, this image gets downloaded from a Get Notify server. Get Notify will know exactly when 
your sent email was opened and it notifies you through an email that your sent message was read by the recipient. 
You can also view log files within your online account. The tracking image inserted by Get Notify is invisible to 
the recipient. Optionally, you can specify your own images to be used as tracking images by going to the 
preferences section after signing in to GetNotify.com. Your recipient will not see ".getnotify.com" at the end of 
his or her email address. If you want to send a single email to multiple recipients, you should add ".getnotify.com" 
at the end of every email address.
I would then know that you clicked the link from a Mac computer through Firefox. 1 would have details about 
your hardware and know all of the fonts installed to the operating system. I would know that you arc connected 
to PIA VPN from a west coast server, but your system time is set to Mountain. I would also know you are 
logged in to a Google product. If you would like to see what details your computer would submit to this script, 
I have a test page available at the following URL.
There are countless scenarios that may make these techniques beneficial to your online research. While I used it 
for law enforcement, especially in tracking down stolen goods on Craigslist, civilians can use it for many different 
things. Private investigators have used it on dating websites while hunting cheating spouses. Singles have used 
it to verify that the potential mate they have been chatting with is local and not in another state or country. The 
possibilities are endless.
This page does not collect your details or store them on my server and nothing is logged. It simply generates the 
same queries through JavaScript through your own browser and displays them within your screen. Theoretically, 
any website could replicate these tactics and collect data about your visit. This is why investigators should always 
use caution and practice good operational security. I dive deep into this topic in my book Extreme Privacy.

Open source government and business information has never been easier to obtain. A combination of a more 
transparent government, cheaper digital storage costs, and marketing data leaks has placed more information 
online than ever before. There is no standard method of searching this data. One county may handle the queries 
much differently than another county', and business records vary by state. The following resources and 
techniques should get you started in the United States.
A Google search of your county of interest should identify whether an online court records database is available. 
As an example, St. Clair County' in Illinois possesses a website that has their entire civil and criminal court 
records online (co.st-clair.il.us/departments/circuit-clerk/courts). Searching only a last name will present 
profiles with full name, date of birth, physical identifiers, case history, fines, pending appearances, and more. 
Navigating the website will expose charged crimes even if they were dismissed. This can be extremely useful in 
civil litigation. There are several websites that help connect you to publicly available county’ government records, 
such as Black Book Online. It allows you to drill down to your local records. The main page will prompt for the 
state desired. The result will be a list of links that access each county's court information. Some rural areas are 
not online, but an occasional search should be done to see if they have been added. Repeating my previous 
search of Madison County’, Illinois revealed the following court related databases.
Recorded Documents
Registered Lobbyists
Press Releases
Voter Registration Verification
Voter Registration Addresses
Counties all over America have digitized the majority of their public records and allow unlimited access over the 
internet. Searching for your county's website will likely present many information options. This can become 
overwhelming and it can be easy to get lost within the pages of the site. My initial preference when just beginning 
an investigation is to use Black Book Online's free county public records page. It allows you to drill down from 
state to county’. The resulting page isolates all available records for viewing. As an example, I chose Illinois and 
then Madison County’ as my target. I was presented with the following databases, each linking directly to the 
source.
If the Black Book Online options do not provide optimal results, please consider Public Records Online 
(publicrecords.onlinesearchcs.com) or a new robust online service which appeared in 2021 called Netronline 
(publicrecords.netronline.com). This option seems to receive more updates of both content and design than 
Black Book Online. Ultimately, all of these simply connect you to the source of the records. Use the option 
which works best in your area.

RECAP (PACER backwards) allows users to automatically search for free copies during a search in PACER, 
and to help build up a free alternative database at the Internet Archive. It is an extension for the Firefox and 
Chrome browsers. Each PACER document is first checked if it has already been uploaded by another user to 
the Internet Archive. If no free version exists and the user purchases the document from PACER, it will 
automatically upload a copy to the Internet Archive's PACER database. While the browser extension assists 
gready with searching, a search page exists on RECAP at the address above.
Searching "Facebook" within the official site provides numerous results. However, after clicking through three 
case summaries, you will likely receive a notification to purchase a monthly premium membership. This may be 
acceptable if you plan to use the service heavily, but there are many additional free resources available. Consider 
conducting your queries through Google instead. Since the case summaries are publicly available, Google 
appears to have indexed most, if not all, of the pages. The following Google search produced over 10,000 results.
The documents area is restricted, but the docket entries are public. In this case, the details provide dates and 
actions taken within the litigation. Below is a partial example. UniCourt is now a staple within my investigations, 
but I rely on Google to find a direct link to the data.
This court document search site appeared in 2018 and currendy possesses an impressive database. The search 
options are straightforward, and results appear quickly, but you are limited to three searches without a paid 
membership. In my experience, clearing your browser's cache and selecting a new VPN IP address seems to 
reset this restriction. This is a premium site with full court documents hidden from guests, but we can obtain a 
fair amount of free information. Let's conduct an actual example.
PACER is an acronym for Public Access to Court Electronic Records. It is an electronic public access service 
of United States federal court documents. It allows users to obtain case and docket information from the United 
States district courts, United States courts of appeals, and United States bankruptcy courts. It holds more than 
800 million documents. PACER charges S0.10 per page. The cost to access a single document is capped atS3.00, 
the equivalent of 30 pages. The cap does not apply to name searches, reports that are not case-specific, and 
transcripts of federal court proceedings. Account creation is free and if your usage does not exceed S15 in a 
quarter, the fees are waived. I have possessed an account for several years and have never been billed for my 
minimal usage. PACER has been criticized for being hard to use and for demanding fees for records which are 
in the public domain. In reaction, non-profit projects have begun to make such documents available online for 
free.

This service currendy announces the presence of 439 million court records throughout the United States. The 
site is very active and new counties are added often. The search feature functions well and accepts traditional 
search operators. By placing my name in quotes, I immediately identified an Illinois Supreme Court case in 
which I was mentioned. The site is completely free with no business model. I hope it sticks around. A direct 
URL query' follows.
The Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) allows us to demand government records from various entities. Filing 
a specific request exceeds the scope of this book, but you should know that a lot of public information is already 
available online. This site appears to rely on Bing to index government websites, so I assumed that this resource 
was unnecessary'. However, my' attempts to replicate some of the results within Google were unsuccessful. As 
an example, I searched for "Darrell Bazzell" on the FOIA site and received a specific result from a 2001 
committee session. I replicated this search within Google and could not retrieve the same entry’. Therefore, this 
service should be available within your arsenal of tools. A static submission URL is as follows, and present 
within the search tool.
This service is unique in that it uses artificial intelligence (/\I) in order to populate and update business records. 
I do not know how much of this is legitimate process and not marketing hype, but I consistently find unique 
data here. The default search options query' business names and registration numbers, and usually provide the 
same results as the previous options. However, the "More Fields" area allows entry’ of an email address, 
telephone number, or name of an individual. I have used this option to search personal email addresses and 
retrieve associated businesses. Fortunately, AIHIT allows search submission via URL as follows.
Practically every' state offers a searchable database of all businesses created or registered within the state. This 
will usually identify the owner(s), board members, and other associated subjects. Dun & Bradstreet (dnb.com) 
offers a business search within the home page, but many registered companies do not participate with them. In 
my experience, the best overall business lookup entity’ is Open Corporates. This free sendee indexes all 50 states 
in the U.S. plus dozens of additional countries. The records usually identify corporate officers' names, addresses, 
and other contact details. The basic search option allows queries by business name, entity’ registration number, 
or officer name. Clicking the advanced option allows query' by physical address, but requires you to create a free 
account. This website is superior to targeted Google queries, because it indexes and scrapes data directly' from 
government websites. This can assist with identifying historical results that no longer appear within the original 
source. I visit this resource every' time I encounter a business name during my' research, or identify a target that 
would likely' be associated with an organization. Open Corporates allows search submission via URL as follows.
