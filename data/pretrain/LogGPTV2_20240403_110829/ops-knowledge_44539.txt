User:  How to find a specific type of files on a Linux system and perform batch operations, such as delete, move, etc.?
Assistant: Use the find command on the Linux system to find specific types of files, for example, to find all txt files: ``` find /path/to/search -name "*.txt" ``` where /path/to/search is The directory path to be searched, "*.txt" is the type of txt file to be searched. Next, these files can be operated in batches, such as deleting: ``` find /path/to/search -name "*.txt" -delete ``` or moving to other directories: ``` find /path/to/search - name "*.txt" -exec mv {} /path/to/destination \; ``` Among them, {} represents the searched file name, \; represents the end of the command. This command moves all searched txt files into /path/to/destination directory.
