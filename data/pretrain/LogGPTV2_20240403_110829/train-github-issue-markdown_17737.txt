My intellisense is not showing the same behavior as what's shown in the v10.10
release notes.  
Note here how the `@constructor` directive is visible at the end of the
description, suggesting that perhaps it wasn't parsed.

The `name` parameter does not show the description, but the type is displayed
correctly.

There is no intellisense for the greet function

Do I need to do something to explicitly enable the functionality showcased in
the release notes? I tried executing "Reload Javascript Project" both with and
without a jsconfig.json file present already.
