User: I have an issue that I can't seem to find a solution within python.  
From command line I can do this by:
sed '1,/COMMANDS/d' /var/tmp/newFile
This delete everything from line #1 till regex "COMMANDS".  Simple
But I can't do the same with Python that I can find.
The re.sub and multiline doesn't seem to work.
So I have a question how can I do this in a pythonic way?  I really rather not run sed from within python unless I have to.
Assistant: Set a flag false.
Iterate over each line. 
For each line,
1) When you match your pattern, set a flag.
2) If the flag is currently set set, print the line.
