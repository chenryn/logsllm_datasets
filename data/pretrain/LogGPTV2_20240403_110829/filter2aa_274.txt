trademark and service mark GODZILLA.
As such, we request that you remove the 
objectionable imagery and reference 
to GODZILLA from your website to 
eliminate any likelihood of confusion and 
posibility of an inaccurate affiliation with 
Toho and GODZILLA 
Please be advised that your use of the 
GODZILLA mark constitutes a 
trademark infringement and 
confuses consumers and the 
public into believing that your 
“GODZILLA” character originates 
from Toho, which it does not. 
Your use of the “ZILLA” formative 
along with imagery associated with 
GODZILLA … demonstrates an 
attempt by you to trade on the 
goodwill built up by our client.
Thank you for your anticipated 
cooperation.

of Sony's rights; 
(ii) your site provides the means to

(iii) your site promotes the distribution

created by copying and decrypting Sony's

The use of the name "Aibo Kennel 
Club" clearly is designed for no 
purpose other than to trade on the 
good will in AKC's famous name. … 
Moreover, your organization's web 
site states that registering with the 
Aibo Kennel Club "assures a known 
'lineage' for your Aibo." However, 
the robots do not produce offspring 
so there is no "lineage" to record.
