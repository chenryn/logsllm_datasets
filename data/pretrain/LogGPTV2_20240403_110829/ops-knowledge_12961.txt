User: is it possible to create python executable targeted for linux, from mac os x?
PyInstaller seems to be at an early stage, and I don't know much else.
Thanks
Assistant: Do you really need a standalone executable? For most Linux distributions, the easier and more common way to distribute Python software is to just distribute the source.
Every major Linux distribution already has Python installed, and some have it installed by default.
