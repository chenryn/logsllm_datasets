each category is 0.01 BTC, and over 21% of all bets (896,864 out
of 4,127,979) are exactly this minimum value. Figure 7b shows
that Satoshi Dice — just in terms of its outgoing transactions — ac-
counts for anywhere between 30% and 40% of such micro-valued
transactions (we found very similar results looking instead at the
incoming transactions for Satoshi Dice). Referring back to Fig-
ure 2 and the rise of micro-valued transactions, we conclude that a
large fraction of this rise can be attributed just to Satoshi Dice. In
addition to allowing small bets, Satoshi Dice also acts extremely
quickly. Once a bet is placed, the outcome is decided immediately
and the payout is returned within seconds, as shown in Figure 7c.
As with micro-valued transactions, referring back to Figure 3 in-
dicates that Satoshi Dice also accounts for much of the rise of im-
mediate spending (as a weekly average, nearly 50% of immediate
transactions are due to Satoshi Dice).
Because of its immense popularity, and the extent to which it
has inﬂated the size of the block chain (an extra 30,000 transac-
tions translates into an extra 14MB added to the overall block chain
daily), the opinion of Satoshi Dice in the Bitcoin community is
somewhat mixed: some decry it as a DoS attack,5 while others ap-
preciate that it has stress-tested the Bitcoin network.
It might be tempting to additionally think that, given the large
amounts of bitcoins ﬂowing through it, Satoshi Dice could act as
a mix service:6 if “dirty” bitcoins were gambled using 97% win-
ning odds, and the resulting bitcoins were paid out to a different
address, these bitcoins might at ﬁrst glance appear to have no as-
sociation with the gambled money (especially if they came from a
different address than the gambled money was sent to, as is some-
times the case). Because the addresses that Satoshi Dice uses are
public, however, it is trivial to observe when users are gambling;
furthermore, in sending a bet to Satoshi Dice, a user must explic-
itly identify where the payout should be sent. Thus, without using
services such as Satoshi Dice as a co-conspirator (which they seem
to have no incentive to do, as they made over $500,000 in their ﬁrst
eight months alone [11]), the bitcoins paid out are indelibly linked
to the ones that were placed as a bet.
5.2 Trafﬁc analysis of illicit activity
We next turn our attention to another dominant category of ser-
vice: exchanges. Although not nearly as active as Satoshi Dice, ex-
changes have essentially become chokepoints in the Bitcoin econ-

The area of the cluster represents the external incoming value; i.e., the bitcoins received from

omy: to buy into or cash out of Bitcoin at scale, we argue that using
an exchange is unavoidable. While sites like localbitcoins.
com and bitcoinary.com do allow you to avoid exchanges (for
the former, by matching up buyers directly with sellers in their geo-
graphic area), the current and historical volume on these sites does
not seem to be high enough to support cashing out at scale.
For criminals, this centrality presents a unique problem:
if a
thief steals thousands of bitcoins, this theft is unavoidably visible
within the Bitcoin network, and thus the initial address of the thief
is known and (as most exchanges try to maintain some air of rep-
utability) he cannot simply transfer the bitcoins directly from the
theft to a known exchange.7 While he might attempt to use a mix
service to hide the source of the money, we again argue that these
services do not currently have the volume to launder thousands of
bitcoins. As such, thieves have developed various strategies for
hiding the source of the bitcoins that we explore in this section.
In particular, we focus on the effectiveness of Heuristic 2 in de-
anonymizing these ﬂows, and thus in tracking illicitly-obtained bit-
coins to exchanges (and thus, e.g., providing an agency with sub-
poena power the opportunity to learn whose account was deposited
into, and in turn potentially the identity of the thief). For this ap-
7Indeed, the Bitcoin community has recently demonstrated both
the inherent traceability of thefts and the unwillingness to accept
stolen money (see bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=
14085.msg1910231). After 923 BTC was stolen from the min-
ing pool Ozcoin and transferred to a Strongcoin wallet, Strongcoin
intercepted the bitcoins when the thief attempted to withdraw them
and returned them to Ozcoin.
proach to work, we do not need to (and cannot) account for each
and every stolen bitcoin, but rather need to demonstrate only some
ﬂow of bitcoins directly from the theft to an exchange or other
known institution.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of Heuristic 2 in this endeavor,
we focus on an idiom of use that we call a “peeling chain.” The us-
age of this pattern extends well beyond criminal activity, and is seen
(for example) in the withdrawals for many banks and exchanges, as
well as in the payouts for some of the larger mining pools. In a peel-
ing chain, a single address begins with a relatively large amount of
bitcoins (e.g., for mining pools it starts with the 25 BTC reward).
A smaller amount is then “peeled” off this larger amount, creating
a transaction in which a small amount is transferred to one address
(e.g., 0.1 BTC for a miner payout), and the remainder is transferred
to a one-time change address. This process is repeated — poten-
tially for hundreds or thousands of hops — until the larger amount
is pared down, at which point (in one usage) the amount remain-
ing in the address might be aggregated with other such addresses
to again yield a large amount in a single address, and the peeling
process begins again. By using Heuristic 2, we are able to track
ﬂows of money by following these change links systematically: at
each hop, we look at the two output addresses in the transaction. If
one of these outputs is a change address, we can follow the chain
to the next hop by following the change address (i.e., the next hop
is the transaction in which this change address spends its bitcoins),
and can identify the meaningful recipient in the transaction as the
other output address (the “peel”).

Silk Road and Bitcoin Savings & Trust.
One of the most well-known and heavily scrutinized addresses
in Bitcoin’s history is 1DkyBEKt,8 which is believed to be associ-
ated with Silk Road and was active between January and Septem-
ber 2012. Starting in January, the address began to receive large
aggregate sums of bitcoins; in the ﬁrst of these, the funds of 128 ad-
dresses were combined to deposit 10,000 BTC into the 1DkyBEKt
address, and many transactions of this type followed (including
one transaction in which the funds of 589 addresses were com-
bined to deposit 8,000 BTC). All together, the address received
613,326 BTC in a period of eight months, receiving its last ag-
gregate deposit on August 16 2012.
Then, starting in August 2012, bitcoins were aggregated and
withdrawn from 1DkyBEKt: ﬁrst, amounts of 20,000, 19,000, and
60,000 BTC were aggregated and sent to separate addresses; later,
100,000 BTC each was sent to two distinct addresses, 150,000 BTC
to a third, and 158,336 BTC to a fourth, effectively emptying the
1DkyBEKt address of all of its funds. The balance of this address
over time, as well as the balance of Silk Road and of vendors as a
whole (as we consider Silk Road a vendor), is shown in Figure 8.
Due to its large balance (at its height, it contained 5% of all gen-
erated bitcoins), as well as the curious nature of its rapidly accumu-
lated wealth and later dissolution, this address has naturally been

the subject of heavy scrutiny by the Bitcoin community. While it
is largely agreed that the address is associated with Silk Road (and
indeed our clustering heuristic did tag this address as being con-
trolled by Silk Road), some have theorized that it was the “hot”
(i.e., active) wallet for Silk Road, and that its dissipation represents
a changing storage structure for the service. Others, meanwhile,
have argued that it was the address belonging to the user pirate@40,
who was responsible for carrying out the largest Ponzi scheme in
Bitcoin history (the investment scheme Bitcoin Savings & Trust,
which is now the subject of a lawsuit brought by the SEC [20]).
To see where the funds from this address went, and if they ended
up with any known services, we ﬁrst plotted the balance of each
of the major categories of services, as seen in Figure 9. Looking
at this ﬁgure, it is clear that when the address was dissipated, the
resulting funds were not sent en masse to any major services, as
the balances of the other categories do not change signiﬁcantly. To
nevertheless attempt to ﬁnd out where the funds did go, we turn to
the trafﬁc analysis described above.
In particular, we focus on the last activity of the 1DkyBEKt ad-
dress, when it deposited 158,336 BTC into a single address. This
address then peeled off 50,000 BTC each to two separate addresses,
leaving 58,336 BTC for a third address; each of these addresses
then began a peeling chain, which we followed using the methodol-
ogy described above (i.e., at each hop we continued along the chain
by following the change address, and considered the other output

Table 2: Tracking bitcoins from 1DkyBEKt. Along the ﬁrst 100
hops of the ﬁrst, second, and third peeling chains resulting from the
withdrawal of 158,336 BTC, we consider the number of peels seen
to each service, as well as the total number of bitcoins (rounded
to the nearest integer value) sent in these peels. The services are
separated into the categories of exchanges, wallets, gambling, and
vendors.
address to be a meaningful recipient of the money). After follow-
ing 100 hops along each chain, we observed peels to the services
listed in Table 2.
Looking at this table, we see that, although a longitudinal look
at the balances of major services did not reveal where the money
went, following these chains revealed that bitcoins were in fact sent
to a variety of services. The overall balance was not highly affected,
however, as the amounts sent were relatively small and spread out
over a handful of transactions. Furthermore, while our analysis
does not itself reveal the owner of 1DkyBEKt, the ﬂow of bitcoins
from this address to known services demonstrates the prevalence
of these services (54 out of 300 peels went to exchanges alone)
and provides the potential for further de-anonymization: the evi-
dence that the deposited bitcoins were the direct result of either a
Ponzi scheme or the sale of drugs might motivate Mt. Gox or any
exchange (e.g., in response to a subpoena) to reveal the account
owner corresponding to the deposit address in the peel, and thus
provide information to link the address to a real-world user.
Tracking thefts.
To ensure that our analysis could be applied more generally, we
turned ﬁnally to a broader class of criminal activity in the Bitcoin
network: thefts. Thefts are in fact quite common within Bitcoin:
almost every major service has been hacked and had bitcoins (or,
in the case of exchanges, other currencies) stolen, and some have
shut down as a result.
To begin, we used a list of major Bitcoin thefts;9 some of the
thefts did not have public transactions (i.e., ones we could iden-
tify and study in the block chain), so we limited our attention to
