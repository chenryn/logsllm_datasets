Each category is priced at 0.01 BTC, and over 21% of all bets (896,864 out of 4,127,979) are placed at this minimum value. As shown in Figure 7b, Satoshi Dice accounts for between 30% and 40% of these micro-valued transactions when considering outgoing transactions alone. Similar results were observed for incoming transactions. Referring to Figure 2, which illustrates the rise of micro-valued transactions, we conclude that a significant portion of this increase can be attributed to Satoshi Dice.

In addition to enabling small wagers, Satoshi Dice operates with remarkable speed. Once a bet is placed, the outcome is determined instantly, and the payout is returned within seconds, as depicted in Figure 7c. Similarly, Figure 3 indicates that Satoshi Dice is responsible for a substantial portion of the increase in immediate spending, with nearly 50% of such transactions being due to Satoshi Dice on a weekly average.

Due to its immense popularity and the significant impact it has had on the size of the blockchain (adding approximately 30,000 transactions, or 14 MB, to the blockchain daily), opinions about Satoshi Dice within the Bitcoin community are divided. Some view it as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, while others appreciate its role in stress-testing the Bitcoin network.

It might be tempting to consider Satoshi Dice as a potential mix service, given the large volume of bitcoins flowing through it. If "dirty" bitcoins were gambled using 97% winning odds and the resulting winnings were paid out to a different address, the bitcoins might initially appear unlinked to the original funds, especially if they came from a different address. However, because the addresses used by Satoshi Dice are public, it is straightforward to observe when users are gambling. Additionally, when placing a bet, users must explicitly specify where the payout should be sent. Therefore, without the cooperation of Satoshi Dice (which seems unlikely given their substantial profits), the bitcoins paid out remain indelibly linked to the ones used to place the bet.

### 5.2 Traffic Analysis of Illicit Activity

Next, we turn our attention to another dominant category of services: exchanges. Although not as active as Satoshi Dice, exchanges have become essential chokepoints in the Bitcoin economy. To buy into or cash out of Bitcoin at scale, using an exchange is almost unavoidable. While sites like localbitcoins.com and bitcoinary.com allow direct peer-to-peer transactions, their current and historical volumes are not sufficient to support large-scale cashing out.

For criminals, this centrality presents a unique challenge. If a thief steals thousands of bitcoins, the theft is inevitably visible within the Bitcoin network, and the initial address of the thief becomes known. Most reputable exchanges will not accept stolen funds directly. While a thief might attempt to use a mix service to hide the source of the money, these services currently lack the volume to launder large amounts of bitcoins. Consequently, thieves have developed various strategies to obscure the source of the stolen bitcoins, which we explore in this section.

We focus on the effectiveness of Heuristic 2 in de-anonymizing these flows and tracking illicitly-obtained bitcoins to exchanges. For this approach to work, we do not need to account for every stolen bitcoin but rather demonstrate some flow of bitcoins directly from the theft to an exchange or other known institution.

To illustrate the effectiveness of Heuristic 2, we focus on a usage pattern called a "peeling chain." This pattern is common in withdrawals from banks and exchanges, as well as in payouts from larger mining pools. In a peeling chain, a single address starts with a large amount of bitcoins (e.g., a 25 BTC reward). A smaller amount is then "peeled" off, creating a transaction where a small amount is transferred to one address (e.g., 0.1 BTC for a miner payout), and the remainder is transferred to a one-time change address. This process is repeated, potentially for hundreds or thousands of hops, until the larger amount is reduced. By using Heuristic 2, we can track the flow of money by following these change links systematically: at each hop, we identify the meaningful recipient as the other output address (the "peel").

### Case Study: Silk Road and Bitcoin Savings & Trust

One of the most well-known and heavily scrutinized addresses in Bitcoin's history is 1DkyBEKt, believed to be associated with Silk Road and active between January and September 2012. Starting in January, the address began receiving large aggregate sums of bitcoins. Over eight months, the address received 613,326 BTC, with its last aggregate deposit on August 16, 2012.

In August 2012, bitcoins were aggregated and withdrawn from 1DkyBEKt. Large amounts (ranging from 20,000 to 158,336 BTC) were sent to separate addresses, effectively emptying the 1DkyBEKt address. The balance of this address over time, as well as the balance of Silk Road and vendors, is shown in Figure 8.

Due to its large balance (at its peak, it contained 5% of all generated bitcoins) and the rapid accumulation and dissipation of wealth, this address has been subject to intense scrutiny. While it is generally agreed that the address is associated with Silk Road, some speculate it was the "hot" wallet for Silk Road, and its dissipation represents a change in storage structure. Others argue it belonged to the user pirate@40, responsible for the largest Ponzi scheme in Bitcoin history (Bitcoin Savings & Trust).

To trace the funds from this address, we plotted the balance of each major category of services (Figure 9). The balances did not change significantly, indicating the funds were not sent en masse to any major services. We then followed the peeling chains, revealing that bitcoins were sent to a variety of services, though in relatively small and spread-out amounts. This analysis provides the potential for further de-anonymization, as exchanges may reveal the account owner corresponding to the deposit address in response to a subpoena.

### Tracking Thefts

Finally, we applied our analysis to a broader class of criminal activity: thefts. Thefts are common in Bitcoin, with almost every major service having experienced hacks and thefts. Using a list of major Bitcoin thefts, we focused on those with public transactions. Our analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of Heuristic 2 in tracking stolen bitcoins and highlighted the prevalence of exchanges in the flow of these funds.
