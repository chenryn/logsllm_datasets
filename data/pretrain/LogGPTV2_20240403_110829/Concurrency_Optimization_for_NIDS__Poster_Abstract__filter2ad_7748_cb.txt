routinely for the separation and analysis of polar metabolites

Improved High-throughput Targeted Lipidomic Analysis with sMRM Pro Builder
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Santosh Kapil Kumar Gorti, SCIEX, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Sean Seymour, Mackenzie J Pearson, Christie Hunter, Paul RS Baker
Isomer interference among different lipid classes is known as one of major challenges for application of LC-MS/MS methods for lipidomic analysis 
Often, one lipid molecule can have multiple isomers and lipid classes sharing the identical precursor and product masses To overcome this 
issue, an Amide chromatographic method is implemented to provide LC separation of lipid classes In order to confirm separation efficiency, lipids 
standards (one standard per lipid class) were injected individually to confirm that there was no isomer crosstalk among different lipid classes 
Preliminary data is collected with no MRM scheduling on a representative matrix (with or without internal standards) for any biological study Results 
from this unscheduled MRM datasets are entered into the sMRM Pro Builder and an initial rough approximation of the retention times is determined 
Next replicate injections are performed on the matrix using a preliminary retention time scheduled MRM method, ideally with a pooled sample from 
all the biological samples Data analysis here provides information on peak width, RT variance, lipid signal, then the sMRM Pro Builder computes a 
final optimized time scheduled MRM method Excellent reproducibility was observed with majority of lipid species showing retention time standard 
deviations below 005 minutes Lipid standards from 19 different classes, which are either heavy isotopic labeled lipids or odd chain lipids, were 
used as internal standard This method provided extensive lipid class coverages including, CE, CER, DCER, HCER, LCER, TAG, DAG, MAG, LPC, PC, 
LPE, PE, LPG, PG, LPI, PI, LPS and PS

Improving lipid annotation coverage using intelligent precursor selection software on an Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Elizabeth Crawford, Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Sven Hackbusch, David Peake, Reiko Kiyonami
Lipid profiling provides valuable information to identify disease states and other physiological changes A common approach used in lipid profiling 
by LC-MS is to identify lipid species by their MS/MS spectra prior to extraction of precursor information for relative quantitation between conditions 
The novel intelligent data acquisition strategy, AcquireX, on the Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer automatically 
excludes background ions from the MS/MS acquisition and prioritizes MS/MS precursor selection on sample relevant compounds, resulting in 
deeper lipidome coverage Here, Bovine liver total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used to demonstrate the utility of the workflow Samples 
were separated using reversed-phase conditions on a C30 column with mass spectral data acquired on an Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid MS Data analysis 
was performed using Thermo Scientific™ LipidSearch™ 42 software to identify lipid molecular species based on acquired MSn fragmentation 
spectra The AcquireX data acquisition strategy was used to automatically generate background exclusion and/or compound inclusion lists that 
were updated iteratively for replicate injections, reducing redundant data collection and triggering more unique lipids for fragmentation As a result, 
a significantly larger number of lipids (>40%) could be detected compared to a conventional data-dependent MS/MS approach In addition, the 
acquisition of neutral loss-triggered CID-MS3 and product ion-triggered CID-MS2 improved the confidence in the lipid annotations For example, the 
use of fatty acid neutral loss-triggered MS3 fragmentation with triglycerides allowed to distinguish multiple co-eluting isomers with different fatty 
acid chain lengths based on their respective MS3 data

Intelligent Acquisition for Comprehensive Metabolome Coverage in Plants, Mammals, and Bacteria
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Tatjana Talamantes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Sven Hackbusch, Ioanna Ntai, Amanda Souza
Compound identification remains a challenge in untargeted metabolomics In LC/MS based untargeted metabolomics experiments, the detection of 
thousands of features in a single sample is routinely accomplished However, this should not be equated to “global” metabolome coverage, as only 
a small percentage of those metabolites are of biological origin Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) often provides information for the most abundant 
ions Recently developed AcquireX acquisition software can determine on-the-fly features corresponding to background contaminants and 
compound degeneracy, such as isotopes, adducts, and dimers, enabling more efficient MS/MS and MSn sampling of unique biologically relevant 
metabolites Unlike traditional DDA, during which the fragmentation of background ions dominates the duty cycle, the AcquireX workflow selects 
precursors intelligently by excluding background ions and targeting unique metabolites of biological relevance for fragmentation Here, we used 
samples of varying matrix and complexity, to demonstrate the utility of AcquireX acquisition across several sample types By excluding background 
and degenerate signals, the total number of fragmentation targets was reduced without compromising metabolite coverage By focusing acquisition 
on biologically relevant compounds, more time could be spent collecting multistage (MSn) fragmentation data, without affecting experiment length 
MSn provided additional structural information and confidence for compound annotations and, in the case of flavonoids, isomeric compound 
annotation candidates could be differentiated without the need for additional experiments Ultimately, AcquireX intelligent acquisition enabled 
annotation of non-biological and redundant features on-the-fly, resulting in comprehensive MSn coverage regardless of sample type, complexity, 
and concentration For Research Use Only Not for use in diagnostic procedures

Development of a Collision Cross Section Library using Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS) and Its Use in  
Plant Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Mark Schroeder, University of Missouri - Columbia, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Sven Meyer, Aiko Barsch, Lloyd W. Sumner
The timsTOF has been frequently used in the analysis of proteomics and is now gaining increased interest for small-molecule metabolomics 
To evaluate the potential benefits the TIMS technology can provide, we have measured the CCS values of plant specialized metabolites such 
as flavonoids and saponins These compounds are structurally diverse due to various flavonoid and triterpene aglycones as well as various 
modifications to the aglycones such as hydroxylation and glycosylation We recorded CCS values for over 150 specialized metabolites Specifically, 
the samples were analyzed in triplicate and the average, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation (RSD) of CCS values were recorded 
RSD of <10% were obtained for all compounds In addition, we annotated adduct formations of the metabolites which are commonly observed 
in LC-MS analysis To test the robustness of the CCS measurements and matching of library compounds to analytes we further tested a standard 
mix of 5 compounds from our library We pooled 5 flavonoids and glycosylated flavonoids and analyzed with and without a plant compound matrix 
through direct infusion TIMS-QTOFMS and UHPLC-TIMS-QTOFMS Then we compared the recorded CCS values between the various methods 
and the recorded library We found the CCS measurements and the library were consistent and the compounds could be reproducibly detected 
and identified during data processing The usefulness of the CCS library was demonstrated in the analysis of Medicago truncatula and Glycine max 
extracts Results indicated that the CCS library allowed for more confident identifications of flavonoids and saponins with improved annotation 
quality scores

Simultaneous analysis of SIM and Scan mode in a single run using LC-QTOFMS: Comprehensive cell culture profiling of iPS cell
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Takanari Hattori, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Toshiya Matsubara, Tsuyoshi Nakanishi, Jun Watanabe
Culture medium is composed of various biologically important compounds such as vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids and other primary 
metabolites Comprehensive analysis of these compounds would lead to more detailed understanding of the bioprocess We report comprehensive 
cell culture profiling of iPS cell by metabolomics based LC-QTOFMS SIM and Scan mode were simultaneously used in a single run Feeder-free iPS 
cells (1231A3) were maintained in AK02N medium for 6 days Proteins were removed from the supernatants by adding acetonitrile and centrifugation 
The supernatants were analyzed after dilution with ultrapure water NexeraTM X2 system coupled with a LCMSTM-9030 (Shimadzu Corporation, 
Japan) was used MS analysis consisted of SIM and Scan mode in positive mode 68 compounds were targeted for SIM mode MS spectra were 
acquired from m/z 50 to 500 for Scan mode As a result of targeted analysis using SIM mode, 27 compounds such as amino acids and vitamins were 
detected with high sensitivity Alanine, kynurenine, ornithine and few compounds have increased with time course In contrast, arginine, methionine, 
tryptophan and few compounds have decreased with time course As a result of untargeted analysis using Scan mode, some unknown compounds 
were detected and their amount have increased or decreased with time course Accurate mass, database (Human Metabolome Database) 
and MS/MS spectrum were used to identify unknown compounds and N’-formylkynurenine was identified as one of unknown compounds N’-
formylkynurenine is intermediate metabolite between tryptophan and kynurenine in kynurenine pathway N’-formylkynurenine have increased with 
time course

HILIC-HR-MS for (untargeted) metabolomics in microorganisms – the optimal method for polar compounds in an  
industrial setting?
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Leon Coulier, DSM Biotechnology Center, Netherlands
CO-AUTHORS: Wouter Coppes, Reza Maleki-Seifar, Sandra Pous-Torres, Raymond Ramaker
The analysis of polar intracellular metabolites, eg amino acids, organic acids, sugar phosphates and nucleotides, is always a challenge Although 
for each class of compounds separate methods are available, there are not many methods that can cover all these classes at once One of the 
methods that can do this is ion-pair liquid chromatography Ion-pair LC gives very good retention for polar metabolites on C18 columns The 
major drawback of the use of an ion-pair agent is the contamination of the MS, especially when MS instruments are shared and used for different 
purposes This often means that the only option to use ion-pair LC is having a dedicated LC-MS system that is only used for this purpose However, 
this might not always be possible and when possible, there is not always high-end LC-MS equipment available There was therefore a big need in 
our lab to find a good alternative for ion pair LC The aim was to have a method that is compatible with high-end HR-MS equipment Hydrophilic 
interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is often proposed as good alternative and many papers have described the possibilities of HILIC for 
the analysis of polar intracellular metabolites In this poster we will describe our search for the best HILIC-HR-MS method for intracellular polar 
metabolites that could replace our ion-pair LC-MS method Different columns, buffers, pH etc were studied and, very important, the method was 
tested using real-life complex matrices and samples

A high throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics method and its application in early warning  
of diabetes
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Yang Ouyang, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China
CO-AUTHORS: Xinjie Zhao, Guowang Xu
Metabolomics has been widely applied in clinical study recently For conventional metabolomics methods based on liquid chromatography-mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS), procedures of pretreatment and separation are time-consuming And it directly influences the sample throughput To fulfill 
the requirement of the large-scale sample analysis, a high throughput metabolomics method was established by using an efficient 96-well-plate-
based sample preparation protocol and a short 12-min LC gradient, which reduced about 70% of the sample processing time and 60% of the 
analysis time Evaluation of analytical performances including the coverage of metabolites reflected that the method was robust for the large-scale 
metabolomics study To show the usefulness, in a nested case-control study comprising 30,000 Chinese participants, subjects with new-onset 
diabetes in five years were selected as a case group (n=295), matching the subjects of the healthy group with no diabetes in the same period 
according to clinical information such as age and gender (n=295) Using this high throughput method, we found that amino acids, acylcarnitine 
and unsaturated free fatty acids accumulated in the case group, while the amount of lyso-phosphatidylcholine species decreased And differential 
metabolites’ combination also achieved a suitable discriminating power between the control and case Therefore, our research has the potential 
to provide a research basis for the early warning of diabetes Moreover, the high throughput method has a wide application prospect in the field of 
large-scale metabolomics study

Data Stability of GC-FID in Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Takero Sakai, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan
CO-AUTHORS: Yusuke Takemori, Kiyomi Arakawa
One of the most important and difficult problem in Metabolomics is data stability In GC-MS Metabolomics, the data would be unstable as time 
passed after TMS derivatization, that might be caused by MS tuning, pollution, and the stability of derivatized compounds Therefore in GC-MS, 
data acquisition with long time span may sometimes need some modification to the data, such as correction with quality control sample GC-FID is 
a conventional analytical instrument that is useful for many fields However GC-FID might be less utilized in Metabolomics than GC-MS so far This 
is because GC-MS is more powerful in peak annotation and peak annotation is considered necessary for Metabolomics But GC-FID has a massive 
feature for Metabolomics; data stability We prepared commercial product of beer as samples and try to analyze it with GC-FID The stability of the 
obtained data within 60 hours were incredibly better than GC-MS Moreover, we stored the extraction of the samples with dryness and analyzed it 
after 2 weeks The obtained data after 2 weeks were almost identical not only as chromatogram shape but also peak area Under these background 
data, we tried to classify the subtle beer samples that were the same as product but differentiate with their lots and manufacturing place With these 
result, we suggest that GC-FID has an underrated potential for Metabolomics, especially for classification / regression of samples with big data that 
needs more stable data acquisition system than MSs

Chemical isotopic labeling of multiple functional groups in urine metabolome
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Cheng-Yu Hung, Chang Gung Molecular Medicine Research Center, Taiwan
CO-AUTHORS: Cheng-Yu Hung, Ya-Ju, Hsieh, Jau-Song Yu, Yi-Ting Chen
A high proportion of metabolites in human urine possess hydroxyl and amino groups Chemical Isotope Labeling (CIL) is useful for improving the 
poor ionization efficiency and low existing level in biological fluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) Dansyl chloride (DnsCl) 
has been widely reported as a derivatizing reagent for facilitating the MS detection We described a developed dansylation method for improving 
the mass spectrometry detection of the amine/phenol and the hydroxyl metabolites in the urine samples To optimize the whole workflow, we 
measured with five reaction factors including sample diluted factors, reaction volume, reaction time, reaction temperature, and molar ratio of DnsCl 
to catalyst A urinary pooling was labeled with 12C- or 13C-DnsCl on a base-activated reaction Chemical standards of amino acid and hydroxyl 
compounds were constructed for positive control After incubation at 65 for one hour, the equal mole amount of 12C- / 13C-labeled mixtures in 
triplicate were analyzed the peak pairs of labeled metabolites using LC-MS Furthermore, we also compared this developed method with other 
dansylation protocols In summary, this technique improves the detection for labeling both amino group and hydroxyl group simultaneously

Effects of Deuterium Oxide (D2O) in 1H NMR Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Kristina Haslauer, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Germany
CO-AUTHORS: Daniel Hemmler, Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin, Silke Heinzmann
Sample preparation in urine NMR metabolomics generally requires only few steps, however, preparation protocols still have not reached consensus 
Most variability in the protocols is given by varying D2O concentrations as locking substance in buffer systems and temperature handling during 
dwell time prior to measurement We investigated the effect of deuterium oxide concentrations on urine metabolites for different temperature 
conditions and found a successive decrease in creatinine peak area up to 35% after 24 h Creatinine is known to be excreted in a constant rate over 
24 h in healthy individuals and therefore frequently used as normalization factor for urinary dilution Furthermore, creatinine is used as important 
biomarker for renal function To address this loss in peak area, a systematic investigation on the underlying mechanism and the impact was carried 
out in this study A proton-deuterium (H/D) exchange at the CH2 position was revealed by 1H, (IG) 13C, DEPT-HSQC NMR and MS experiments 
leading to this loss Furthermore, we conducted a sample stability examination for different D2O concentrations and temperatures up to 24 h We 
propose an equation to correct the creatinine loss for biobank samples, which was validated on an external dataset, as well as a general guideline 
for future studies to ensure a high creatinine stability

Impact of pre-analytical sample handling on plasma for 1H-metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Anders Pedersen, Swedish NMR Centre at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden
CO-AUTHORS: Daniel Malmodin, Huma Zafar, Åsa Torinsson Naluai, B. Göran Karlsson
The pre-analytical sample handling of plasma samples prior to freezing has an unwanted impact on resulting metabolite concentrations in bio-
banked samples It is important to quantify how various metabolites are affected depending on handling since it otherwise risk to bias studies when 
eg study samples and controls have not been treated equally Using 1H NMR spectroscopy we have investigated the effect on the metabolite 
profile by exposing plasma samples to light or no light, three different temperatures and different times prior to centrifugation While light or no 
light does not influence the metabolite concentrations, temperature and time to centrifugation does, in a predictable way Therefore, it would have 
been preferable if temperature and time to centrifugation values had been stored when samples were collected Since this usually is not the case, 
an alternative approach is to estimate these parameters from relative concentration differences between specific temperature and time sensitive 
metabolites We present sensitive metabolites and outline how their concentrations can be used to estimate the exposure to temperature and time 
to centrifugation for a given sample

Development of a Metabolomics System Suitability Sample for MS-based Metabolomics
PRESENTING AUTHOR: Tracey Schock, National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States
CO-AUTHORS: Deb Ellisor, Clay Davis
Prior to the actual analysis of biological samples, one must first assess the suitability of the analytical instrumentation In this regard, the 
metabolomics community is suffering from the lack of an everyday system suitability standard by which to benchmark instrument performance 
for untargeted MS based approaches A complex solution that mimics biological samples is required to determine whether the analytical run is 
of acceptable quality and to ensure lack of contamination prior to experimental analyses Individual laboratories use a small number of standards 
(5-15) to create in-house suitability solutions for assessing measurement quality of hundreds to thousands of chemicals profiled in an untargeted 
study of incredibly complex samples Over-reporting and spurious conclusions are likely rampant in the literature due to the lack of a material 
to evaluate measurement quality across a complex omics profile NIST is developing a large quantity, biological extract from human liver which 
incorporates the entirety of a metabolome, resulting in a more encompassing system suitability sample The design of a tissue extract as a suitability 
standard eliminates sample preparation variation observed with biological samples while offering simplicity of use and analyte complexity for 
analysis of metabolomics platforms Additionally, the extract can be a tool in harmonization of instrument performance in large, multi-center studies 
NIST candidate research grade material (RGM) 10122 Metabolomics System Suitability Sample will be assessed for homogeneity and stability of 
constituent metabolites The sample is available pre-sale for those interested in evaluating the material for the metabolomics community’s needs

The metabolomics Quality Assurance and quality Control Consortium (mQACC) is a community-led initiative to promote quality assurance (QA) 
and quality control (QC) in untargeted metabolomics research mQACC was established through a National Institutes of Health-funded meeting 
in October 2017 Data from a survey published by Dunn, et al Metabolomics, 2017) was used to establish meeting objectives: 1) identify the 
most useful metrics for assessing study and data quality for untargeted metabolomic studies; 2) identify and prioritize processes to ensure 
appropriate reporting of QA/QC data; and 3) identify and prioritize the types of test materials that are needed in the field of metabolomics for QA/
QC in untargeted studies Key priorities were identified and scored for importance, resulting in several primary themes Although priorities were 
identified for long-term efforts, three immediate priorities were moved forward: 1) publish a workshop report (Beger et al, Metabolomics, 2019); 2) 
document and subsequently publish the complete experimental procedure for untargeted metabolomics; and 3) identify 2-3 reference materials
