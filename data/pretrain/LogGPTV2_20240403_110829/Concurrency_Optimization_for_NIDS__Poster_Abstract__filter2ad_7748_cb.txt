**Improved High-throughput Targeted Lipidomic Analysis with sMRM Pro Builder**

**Presenting Author:** Santosh Kapil Kumar Gorti, SCIEX, United States

**Co-Authors:** Sean Seymour, Mackenzie J. Pearson, Christie Hunter, Paul R.S. Baker

**Abstract:**
Isomer interference among different lipid classes is a significant challenge in the application of LC-MS/MS methods for lipidomic analysis. Often, one lipid molecule can have multiple isomers and lipid classes sharing identical precursor and product masses. To address this issue, an amide chromatographic method was implemented to provide LC separation of lipid classes. To confirm the separation efficiency, individual injections of lipid standards (one standard per lipid class) were performed to ensure no isomer crosstalk among different lipid classes.

Preliminary data was collected without MRM scheduling on a representative matrix (with or without internal standards) for any biological study. The results from these unscheduled MRM datasets were entered into the sMRM Pro Builder to determine an initial rough approximation of retention times. Subsequently, replicate injections were performed on the matrix using a preliminary retention time scheduled MRM method, ideally with a pooled sample from all biological samples. Data analysis provided information on peak width, retention time (RT) variance, and lipid signal, which the sMRM Pro Builder used to compute a final optimized time-scheduled MRM method. Excellent reproducibility was observed, with the majority of lipid species showing retention time standard deviations below 0.05 minutes.

Lipid standards from 19 different classes, including heavy isotopic labeled lipids or odd-chain lipids, were used as internal standards. This method provided extensive lipid class coverage, including CE, CER, DCER, HCER, LCER, TAG, DAG, MAG, LPC, PC, LPE, PE, LPG, PG, LPI, PI, LPS, and PS.

**Improving Lipid Annotation Coverage Using Intelligent Precursor Selection Software on an Orbitrap-based Mass Spectrometer**

**Presenting Author:** Elizabeth Crawford, Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Sven Hackbusch, David Peake, Reiko Kiyonami

**Abstract:**
Lipid profiling provides valuable information for identifying disease states and other physiological changes. A common approach in lipid profiling by LC-MS is to identify lipid species by their MS/MS spectra before extracting precursor information for relative quantitation between conditions. The novel intelligent data acquisition strategy, AcquireX, on the Thermo Scientific™ Orbitrap ID-X™ Tribrid™ mass spectrometer, automatically excludes background ions from the MS/MS acquisition and prioritizes MS/MS precursor selection on sample-relevant compounds, resulting in deeper lipidome coverage.

Bovine liver total lipid extract (Avanti Polar Lipids) was used to demonstrate the utility of this workflow. Samples were separated using reversed-phase conditions on a C30 column, and mass spectral data were acquired on an Orbitrap ID-X Tribrid MS. Data analysis was performed using Thermo Scientific™ LipidSearch™ 4.2 software to identify lipid molecular species based on acquired MSn fragmentation spectra. The AcquireX data acquisition strategy was used to automatically generate background exclusion and/or compound inclusion lists that were updated iteratively for replicate injections, reducing redundant data collection and triggering more unique lipids for fragmentation. As a result, a significantly larger number of lipids (>40%) could be detected compared to a conventional data-dependent MS/MS approach. Additionally, the acquisition of neutral loss-triggered CID-MS3 and product ion-triggered CID-MS2 improved the confidence in lipid annotations. For example, the use of fatty acid neutral loss-triggered MS3 fragmentation with triglycerides allowed the distinction of multiple co-eluting isomers with different fatty acid chain lengths based on their respective MS3 data.

**Intelligent Acquisition for Comprehensive Metabolome Coverage in Plants, Mammals, and Bacteria**

**Presenting Author:** Tatjana Talamantes, Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States

**Co-Authors:** Sven Hackbusch, Ioanna Ntai, Amanda Souza

**Abstract:**
Compound identification remains a challenge in untargeted metabolomics. In LC/MS-based untargeted metabolomics experiments, the detection of thousands of features in a single sample is routine. However, this should not be equated to "global" metabolome coverage, as only a small percentage of those metabolites are of biological origin. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) often provides information for the most abundant ions. Recently developed AcquireX acquisition software can determine on-the-fly features corresponding to background contaminants and compound degeneracy, such as isotopes, adducts, and dimers, enabling more efficient MS/MS and MSn sampling of unique biologically relevant metabolites.

Unlike traditional DDA, during which the fragmentation of background ions dominates the duty cycle, the AcquireX workflow selects precursors intelligently by excluding background ions and targeting unique metabolites of biological relevance for fragmentation. We used samples of varying matrix and complexity to demonstrate the utility of AcquireX acquisition across several sample types. By excluding background and degenerate signals, the total number of fragmentation targets was reduced without compromising metabolite coverage. By focusing acquisition on biologically relevant compounds, more time could be spent collecting multistage (MSn) fragmentation data, without affecting experiment length. MSn provided additional structural information and confidence for compound annotations, and in the case of flavonoids, isomeric compound annotation candidates could be differentiated without the need for additional experiments. Ultimately, AcquireX intelligent acquisition enabled the annotation of non-biological and redundant features on-the-fly, resulting in comprehensive MSn coverage regardless of sample type, complexity, and concentration.

**Development of a Collision Cross Section Library Using Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry (TIMS) and Its Use in Plant Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:** Mark Schroeder, University of Missouri - Columbia, United States

**Co-Authors:** Sven Meyer, Aiko Barsch, Lloyd W. Sumner

**Abstract:**
The timsTOF has been frequently used in proteomics and is now gaining increased interest for small-molecule metabolomics. To evaluate the potential benefits of TIMS technology, we measured the collision cross-section (CCS) values of plant specialized metabolites such as flavonoids and saponins. These compounds are structurally diverse due to various flavonoid and triterpene aglycones, as well as modifications like hydroxylation and glycosylation. We recorded CCS values for over 150 specialized metabolites. Specifically, the samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the average, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation (RSD) of CCS values were recorded. RSDs of <1.0% were obtained for all compounds. We also annotated adduct formations of the metabolites, commonly observed in LC-MS analysis.

To test the robustness of the CCS measurements and matching of library compounds to analytes, we further tested a standard mix of five compounds from our library. We pooled five flavonoids and glycosylated flavonoids and analyzed them with and without a plant compound matrix through direct infusion TIMS-QTOFMS and UHPLC-TIMS-QTOFMS. The recorded CCS values between the various methods and the recorded library were consistent, and the compounds could be reproducibly detected and identified during data processing. The usefulness of the CCS library was demonstrated in the analysis of Medicago truncatula and Glycine max extracts. Results indicated that the CCS library allowed for more confident identifications of flavonoids and saponins with improved annotation quality scores.

**Simultaneous Analysis of SIM and Scan Mode in a Single Run Using LC-QTOFMS: Comprehensive Cell Culture Profiling of iPS Cells**

**Presenting Author:** Takanari Hattori, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Toshiya Matsubara, Tsuyoshi Nakanishi, Jun Watanabe

**Abstract:**
Culture medium is composed of various biologically important compounds such as vitamins, amino acids, nucleic acids, and other primary metabolites. Comprehensive analysis of these compounds would lead to a more detailed understanding of the bioprocess. We report a comprehensive cell culture profiling of iPS cells using LC-QTOFMS. SIM and Scan mode were simultaneously used in a single run. Feeder-free iPS cells (1231A3) were maintained in AK02N medium for six days. Proteins were removed from the supernatants by adding acetonitrile and centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed after dilution with ultrapure water. A NexeraTM X2 system coupled with an LCMSTM-9030 (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan) was used. MS analysis consisted of SIM and Scan mode in positive mode. Sixty-eight compounds were targeted for SIM mode. MS spectra were acquired from m/z 50 to 500 for Scan mode.

As a result of targeted analysis using SIM mode, 27 compounds, such as amino acids and vitamins, were detected with high sensitivity. Alanine, kynurenine, ornithine, and a few other compounds increased over time. In contrast, arginine, methionine, tryptophan, and a few other compounds decreased over time. As a result of untargeted analysis using Scan mode, some unknown compounds were detected, and their amounts increased or decreased over time. Accurate mass, database (Human Metabolome Database), and MS/MS spectrum were used to identify unknown compounds, and N’-formylkynurenine was identified as one of the unknown compounds. N’-formylkynurenine is an intermediate metabolite in the kynurenine pathway and increased over time.

**HILIC-HR-MS for (Untargeted) Metabolomics in Microorganisms – The Optimal Method for Polar Compounds in an Industrial Setting?**

**Presenting Author:** Leon Coulier, DSM Biotechnology Center, Netherlands

**Co-Authors:** Wouter Coppes, Reza Maleki-Seifar, Sandra Pous-Torres, Raymond Ramaker

**Abstract:**
The analysis of polar intracellular metabolites, such as amino acids, organic acids, sugar phosphates, and nucleotides, is always a challenge. Although separate methods are available for each class of compounds, there are not many methods that can cover all these classes at once. One of the methods that can do this is ion-pair liquid chromatography. Ion-pair LC provides excellent retention for polar metabolites on C18 columns. However, the major drawback of using an ion-pair agent is the contamination of the MS, especially when MS instruments are shared and used for different purposes. This often means that the only option to use ion-pair LC is having a dedicated LC-MS system that is only used for this purpose. However, this might not always be possible, and even when it is, high-end LC-MS equipment may not be available.

There was, therefore, a significant need in our lab to find a good alternative to ion-pair LC. The aim was to develop a method compatible with high-end HR-MS equipment. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) is often proposed as a good alternative, and many papers have described its potential for the analysis of polar intracellular metabolites. In this poster, we describe our search for the best HILIC-HR-MS method for intracellular polar metabolites that could replace our ion-pair LC-MS method. Different columns, buffers, pH, etc., were studied, and, very importantly, the method was tested using real-life complex matrices and samples.

**A High Throughput Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Metabolomics Method and Its Application in Early Warning of Diabetes**

**Presenting Author:** Yang Ouyang, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China

**Co-Authors:** Xinjie Zhao, Guowang Xu

**Abstract:**
Metabolomics has been widely applied in clinical studies recently. For conventional metabolomics methods based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), procedures of pretreatment and separation are time-consuming and directly influence sample throughput. To fulfill the requirement of large-scale sample analysis, a high-throughput metabolomics method was established using an efficient 96-well-plate-based sample preparation protocol and a short 12-minute LC gradient, reducing about 70% of the sample processing time and 60% of the analysis time. Evaluation of analytical performance, including metabolite coverage, reflected that the method was robust for large-scale metabolomics studies.

To show the usefulness, in a nested case-control study comprising 30,000 Chinese participants, subjects with new-onset diabetes within five years were selected as a case group (n=295), matched with subjects in the healthy group with no diabetes in the same period according to clinical information such as age and gender (n=295). Using this high-throughput method, we found that amino acids, acylcarnitines, and unsaturated free fatty acids accumulated in the case group, while the amount of lyso-phosphatidylcholine species decreased. Differential metabolites' combination also achieved a suitable discriminating power between the control and case groups. Therefore, our research has the potential to provide a basis for the early warning of diabetes. Moreover, the high-throughput method has a wide application prospect in the field of large-scale metabolomics studies.

**Data Stability of GC-FID in Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:** Takero Sakai, Shimadzu Corporation, Japan

**Co-Authors:** Yusuke Takemori, Kiyomi Arakawa

**Abstract:**
One of the most important and challenging issues in metabolomics is data stability. In GC-MS metabolomics, data can become unstable over time after TMS derivatization, possibly due to MS tuning, pollution, and the stability of derivatized compounds. Therefore, in GC-MS, data acquisition over a long time span may sometimes require modification, such as correction with a quality control sample. GC-FID is a conventional analytical instrument useful in many fields but has been less utilized in metabolomics than GC-MS. This is because GC-MS is more powerful in peak annotation, which is considered necessary for metabolomics. However, GC-FID offers a significant advantage: data stability.

We prepared commercial beer products as samples and analyzed them with GC-FID. The stability of the obtained data within 60 hours was remarkably better than that of GC-MS. Moreover, we stored the extracted samples in a dry state and analyzed them after two weeks. The obtained data after two weeks were almost identical, not only in chromatogram shape but also in peak area. Under these conditions, we attempted to classify subtle differences in beer samples that were the same product but differed in lot and manufacturing place. With these results, we suggest that GC-FID has an underrated potential for metabolomics, especially for classification and regression of samples with big data that require a more stable data acquisition system than MSs.

**Chemical Isotopic Labeling of Multiple Functional Groups in Urine Metabolome**

**Presenting Author:** Cheng-Yu Hung, Chang Gung Molecular Medicine Research Center, Taiwan

**Co-Authors:** Ya-Ju Hsieh, Jau-Song Yu, Yi-Ting Chen

**Abstract:**
A high proportion of metabolites in human urine possess hydroxyl and amino groups. Chemical Isotope Labeling (CIL) is useful for improving the poor ionization efficiency and low existing levels in biological fluids by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Dansyl chloride (DnsCl) has been widely reported as a derivatizing reagent for facilitating MS detection. We developed a dansylation method to improve the mass spectrometry detection of amine/phenol and hydroxyl metabolites in urine samples. To optimize the workflow, we measured five reaction factors: sample dilution factors, reaction volume, reaction time, reaction temperature, and the molar ratio of DnsCl to catalyst. A urinary pool was labeled with 12C- or 13C-DnsCl in a base-activated reaction. Chemical standards of amino acids and hydroxyl compounds were constructed for positive control. After incubation at 65°C for one hour, the equal mole amount of 12C- / 13C-labeled mixtures in triplicate were analyzed using LC-MS to detect peak pairs of labeled metabolites. Furthermore, we compared this developed method with other dansylation protocols. In summary, this technique improves the detection of both amino and hydroxyl groups simultaneously.

**Co-Authors:** Claire O’Donovan, Jiakang Chang, Jose Ramon Macias, Kalai Vanii Jayaseelan, Keeva Cochrane, Kenneth Haug, Namrata Kale, Pablo Moreno, Rachel Spicer, Mark Williams

**Abstract:**
MetaboLights is an international metabolomics repository recommended by many leading journals, including Nature, PLOS, and Metabolomics. The service's unique manual curation maintains quality, provides helpful support for users, and ensures accessibility for secondary analysis of studies. MetaboLights hosts a wealth of cross-species, cross-technique, open-access experimental research. As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline the study submission and curation process, the MetaboLights team at EMBL-EBI has developed a new tool to submit and edit studies online. This submission tool provides MetaboLights users and curators with an intuitive and easy-to-use interface to create, edit, and annotate their studies online. The convenient, context-aware editor navigates users through the study to define a rich description of the experimental metadata, including study characteristics, protocols, technology, and related factors. Metadata descriptions are enhanced by mapping this information to controlled ontologies repositories using ZOOMA, capturing a complete dataset that benefits the community by making results findable, reproducible, and reusable.

Going forward, we plan to incorporate text mining tools such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) to annotate metadata, enabled by the robust architecture of the online editor. Other ideas include offline edit support and direct channels for curators to contact and communicate with submitters, making the whole process of data curation more submitter-friendly.

**Effects of Deuterium Oxide (D2O) in 1H NMR Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:** Kristina Haslauer, Helmholtz Zentrum Munich, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Germany

**Co-Authors:** Daniel Hemmler, Philippe Schmitt-Kopplin, Silke Heinzmann

**Abstract:**
Sample preparation in urine NMR metabolomics generally requires only a few steps, but preparation protocols have not reached consensus. Most variability in the protocols is given by varying D2O concentrations as locking substances in buffer systems and temperature handling during dwell time prior to measurement. We investigated the effect of deuterium oxide concentrations on urine metabolites under different temperature conditions and found a successive decrease in creatinine peak area up to 35% after 24 hours. Creatinine is known to be excreted at a constant rate over 24 hours in healthy individuals and is frequently used as a normalization factor for urinary dilution. Furthermore, creatinine is an important biomarker for renal function.

To address this loss in peak area, a systematic investigation of the underlying mechanism and impact was carried out in this study. A proton-deuterium (H/D) exchange at the CH2 position was revealed by 1H, 13C, DEPT-HSQC NMR, and MS experiments, leading to this loss. We conducted a sample stability examination for different D2O concentrations and temperatures up to 24 hours. We propose an equation to correct the creatinine loss for biobank samples, which was validated on an external dataset, as well as a general guideline for future studies to ensure high creatinine stability.

**Impact of Pre-Analytical Sample Handling on Plasma for 1H-Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:** Anders Pedersen, Swedish NMR Centre at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden

**Co-Authors:** Daniel Malmodin, Huma Zafar, Åsa Torinsson Naluai, B. Göran Karlsson

**Abstract:**
Pre-analytical sample handling of plasma samples prior to freezing has an unwanted impact on resulting metabolite concentrations in biobanked samples. It is important to quantify how various metabolites are affected depending on handling, as it otherwise risks biasing studies when, for example, study samples and controls have not been treated equally. Using 1H NMR spectroscopy, we investigated the effect on the metabolite profile by exposing plasma samples to light or no light, three different temperatures, and different times prior to centrifugation. While light or no light does not influence the metabolite concentrations, temperature and time to centrifugation do, in a predictable way. Therefore, it would have been preferable if temperature and time to centrifugation values had been stored when samples were collected. Since this is usually not the case, an alternative approach is to estimate these parameters from relative concentration differences between specific temperature and time-sensitive metabolites. We present sensitive metabolites and outline how their concentrations can be used to estimate the exposure to temperature and time to centrifugation for a given sample.

**Development of a Metabolomics System Suitability Sample for MS-Based Metabolomics**

**Presenting Author:** Tracey Schock, National Institute of Standards and Technology, United States

**Co-Authors:** Deb Ellisor, Clay Davis

**Abstract:**
Prior to the actual analysis of biological samples, one must first assess the suitability of the analytical instrumentation. In this regard, the metabolomics community is suffering from the lack of an everyday system suitability standard by which to benchmark instrument performance for untargeted MS-based approaches. A complex solution that mimics biological samples is required to determine whether the analytical run is of acceptable quality and to ensure the lack of contamination prior to experimental analyses. Individual laboratories use a small number of standards (5-15) to create in-house suitability solutions for assessing measurement quality of hundreds to thousands of chemicals profiled in an untargeted study of incredibly complex samples. Over-reporting and spurious conclusions are likely rampant in the literature due to the lack of a material to evaluate measurement quality across a complex omics profile.

NIST is developing a large quantity, biological extract from human liver, which incorporates the entirety of a metabolome, resulting in a more encompassing system suitability sample. The design of a tissue extract as a suitability standard eliminates sample preparation variation observed with biological samples while offering simplicity of use and analyte complexity for the analysis of metabolomics platforms. Additionally, the extract can be a tool in harmonizing instrument performance in large, multi-center studies. NIST candidate research grade material (RGM) 10122 Metabolomics System Suitability Sample will be assessed for homogeneity and stability of constituent metabolites. The sample is available pre-sale for those interested in evaluating the material for the metabolomics community’s needs.

**Abstract:**
The metabolomics Quality Assurance and Quality Control Consortium (mQACC) is a community-led initiative to promote quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) in untargeted metabolomics research. mQACC was established through a National Institutes of Health-funded meeting in October 2017. Data from a survey published by Dunn et al. (Metabolomics, 2017) was used to establish meeting objectives: 1) identify the most useful metrics for assessing study and data quality for untargeted metabolomic studies; 2) identify and prioritize processes to ensure appropriate reporting of QA/QC data; and 3) identify and prioritize the types of test materials needed in the field of metabolomics for QA/QC in untargeted studies. Key priorities were identified and scored for importance, resulting in several primary themes. Although priorities were identified for long-term efforts, three immediate priorities were moved forward: 1) publish a workshop report (Beger et al., Metabolomics, 2019); 2) document and subsequently publish the complete experimental procedure for untargeted metabolomics; and 3) identify 2-3 reference materials.
