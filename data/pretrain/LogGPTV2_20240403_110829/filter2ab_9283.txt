In this revised version, I have:

1. **Formatted the ATT&CK ID and Technique Name for clarity and readability.**
2. **Rephrased the sentence to be more precise and professional.**
3. **Ensured the reference number is placed at the end of the sentence for better flow.**

If you need any further adjustments or additional information, please let me know!
