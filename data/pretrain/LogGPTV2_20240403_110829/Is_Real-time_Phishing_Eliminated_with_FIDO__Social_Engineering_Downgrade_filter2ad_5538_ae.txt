### User Agreement and Prompt Display

When a user taps their authenticator device, they agree to complete the request displayed in the prompt. The prompt includes a short message, which browsers present as a native popup that extends slightly above the address bar. For example, Google Chrome captures the top-level domain (TLD) and second-level domains of the website (e.g., `google.com`) and displays them to the user within the prompt box, alongside the message:

**"Use your security key with google.com"**

Mozilla Firefox, on the other hand, includes the fully qualified domain name (e.g., `accounts.google.com`) in a callout panel, displaying the following message:

**"accounts.google.com wants to authenticate you using a registered security key. You can connect and authorize one now, or cancel."**

Since the prompt contains a short message and the website’s domain (rendered in boldface in Firefox), it can potentially alert visitors to a phishing attempt.

### Limitation: User Susceptibility to Social Engineering

Relying on users to notice a domain mismatch is not a reliable countermeasure for several reasons:
1. **FIDO's Promise**: FIDO aims to relieve users from the burden of detecting phishing, so security should not depend on prompts or visual indicators.
2. **User Behavior**: Previous research [6, 7, 19, 81] has shown that users often do not pay attention to or understand browser hints related to security.
3. **Adversary Tactics**: An adversary can use the U2F API to interact with the device without triggering such prompt windows, as demonstrated in our implementation (Section 4.1). Previous work [77] indicates that users easily overlook the absence of security cues.

### Secure Login and Recovery Alternatives

Doeﬂer et al. [20] discuss Google’s categorization of login, second-factor authentication, and account recovery methods. Methods with comparable security are placed in the same category and should be allowed based on the account’s security status, which could be indicated by the user’s security configuration (e.g., enabled 2FA, robust recovery methods).

#### Promising Countermeasure

A viable countermeasure to the attacks discussed herein is to ensure that, when FIDO is enabled, only authentication (or 2FA) alternatives that provide similar resilience to FIDO are allowed. Suitable candidates include other FIDO protocols, such as a phone-based authenticator through FIDO2. This should be recommended and enforced by service providers (websites). A user choosing to register a security key for login is implicitly requesting protection against advanced attacks (e.g., real-time phishing). Therefore, service providers should only allow alternatives with equivalent defense capabilities.

Login and recovery must match in terms of security. For a FIDO-enabled account, recovery through a secondary email with weaker security undermines the overall security. Hammann et al. [37] suggest that account-access graphs could help users and service providers identify vulnerable paths.

### User Education

Many participants in our study relied on incorrect phishing indicators. Some reported waiting to see if the visited page is rendered correctly after clicking a link in an email. For instance, Participant P9-E stated, “If the website looks fine, I mean the front page, I am not suspicious.” Similarly, P20-E misclassified the phishing website as legitimate, saying, “It’s the same because it looks the same up here [refers to logo section], and I would trust it’s fine.” Others rely solely on the email itself; Participant P18-E said, “I decide before whether to click or not, and once I click it, it’s opened (done).” When asked if she continues checking the visited website, she added, “Not really.”

This is not new; phishing and similar social engineering tactics exploit users’ lack of understanding or incomplete mental models [6, 19]. As long as authentication relies on user actions, education remains a plausible but somewhat ineffective countermeasure.

#### Limitation: Impracticality

While education can help users form reasonable mental models of phishing and detect some attacks, it is an incomplete countermeasure. It assumes that users can continuously devote all their attention to this task and that all attacks will have noticeable indicators. Security is rarely the primary task for users [88], and humans cannot remain highly vigilant 100% of the time. Our study showed that some attacks include sufficient contextual indicators, either by design (e.g., spear phishing) or by coincidence, to trick even attentive users who are actively evaluating for security [6].

Educational campaigns or marketing efforts that promote security keys as phishing-resistant can further contribute to users forming incorrect mental models [69], leading to a false sense of security and decreased vigilance against attacks.

### Related Work

Phishing is a widely studied attack vector in the social engineering category, using effective techniques to take over accounts and fool even knowledgeable users [19, 26, 43–45].

#### 2FA Schemes

The industry and academic community have developed several 2FA schemes [48, 50, 57, 58, 68] to protect user accounts. However, real-time phishing remains very effective at bypassing 2FA, and automated tools [34] make such attacks simpler, cheaper, and easy to scale. Previous works [23, 63] report that phishing is widely employed and preferred by malicious actors, even at hack-for-hire services [63].

FIDO is based on public key cryptography [17] and its benefits are already demonstrated in a company setting [55]. The protocol itself is considered secure and is promoted by the industry as being foolproof and phishing-resistant [33]. The research community has focused on the usability aspects of FIDO [18, 70, 74] but has not questioned its security in real-world deployments. However, the necessity for alternative 2FA is emphasized in previous studies [20, 73] because users cannot always complete the FIDO step. On the user side, the possibility of being locked out is reported as the main obstacle for using FIDO in daily routine [24, 30].

#### Anti-Phishing Ecosystem

Service providers, browser vendors, and other entities have developed an ecosystem to detect and prevent phishing. However, adversaries continuously adapt their tools to evade such systems [64–66, 95]. Oest et al. [67] report that a phishing campaign is detected nine hours after the first victim, making spear-phishing targeting individuals much more difficult to prevent. Another line of work [25, 39, 59] tries to detect malicious websites based on URL analysis. Email providers have developed frameworks to filter out phishing emails before they reach users [21, 38], but attackers still find ways to reach their targets' inboxes [63]. To limit the consequences of password reuse [10, 27], prior works have proposed frameworks that allow servers to learn when a password is compromised [80, 87], while [52] shows that secure implementation of critical protocols, such as TLS, is not trivial for developers.

#### Client-Side Countermeasures

Password managers are a possible countermeasure to phishing attacks because credentials are released only if the user visits the correct domain. Blanchou and Youn [9] were among the first to report vulnerabilities in password managers. Others [36, 75] describe the challenges of designing and implementing secure extensions, while [93] reported that spoofing the sidebar is effective in phishing the master password. Yang et al. [94] measured the effectiveness of browser indicators, and [71] show that users lose the ability to detect phishing some period after training.

### Concluding Remarks

OTP-based 2FA schemes are among the most common phishing defenses. Being replayable [3], they fail to defend against real-time phishing, where the adversary relays user-submitted OTPs to the legitimate site in real-time. The FIDO alliance has designed challenge-response mechanisms with browser involvement, which enables the inclusion of a website’s URL in the challenge. Relaying the response becomes useless, and real-time phishing is thus defeated. U2F is one such standard, where the response is computed on a hardware token. To handle token loss or malfunction, websites often allow or force users to register 2FA alternatives to FIDO. All FIDO-supporting websites in Alexa’s top 100 adopt this practice.

We ran a user study to test whether a phishing attack that downgrades FIDO to weaker alternatives is effective. Although the study tested U2F tokens, findings (particularly regarding downgrade effectiveness) can extend to other relevant FIDO specifications. We make the following four remarks:

1. **Graceful Execution of User Studies**: Evaluating attacks through user studies is challenging. Participants may fall for the attacks during the study, not due to successful deception, but due to a lack of investment in protecting assets or misinterpretation of study requirements. If participants' actions were the sole metric, we would have misidentified 88% (instead of 55%) of participants as susceptible to our attacks (Table 2). Such studies, followed by semi-structured interviews, provide richer results.

2. **Susceptibility to Real-Time Phishing**: Even with FIDO, users remain susceptible to real-time phishing that downgrades FIDO to weaker alternatives. Most participants failed to detect our phishing attacks. Those who succeeded (10%) did so without FIDO’s help. We found no case where a participant was close to falling for real-time phishing, but FIDO protected them. Our social engineering involved displaying the FIDO-prompt to users (its result is discarded), followed by a prompt for another 2FA alternative (its result would be relayed to the legitimate server in practice). This appeared to participants as a three-factor login, giving a false sense of security rather than arousing suspicion. The effect of such attacks in practice is exacerbated by two points: (1) users can become less careful seeing more factors, and (2) reassuring wording on login pages (e.g., Google’s statement on 2FA pages, “This extra step shows that it’s really you trying to sign in”).

3. **Understanding FIDO**: Despite understanding how to use FIDO [30], users do not understand how FIDO protects them. No participant mentioned relying on FIDO when discussing how they detected our attacks. FIDO protects users when login is granted after using only FIDO, not after using FIDO plus other factors. The former prevents real-time phishing and downgrade attacks, while the latter enables them. As it is counter-intuitive, no participant appears to have assimilated this concept.

4. **Effective Countermeasure**: Enabling only FIDO alternatives to FIDO is an effective countermeasure. To address the necessity of allowing alternatives to FIDO’s U2F without enabling downgrade attacks, websites should only allow alternatives of comparable security. Many other countermeasures we explored would either expose users to lockouts due to token losses or continue to make users potentially susceptible to other social engineering variations. Relevant FIDO specifications that are also resilient to real-time phishing (e.g., CTAP2) appear to be suitable alternatives from a security perspective.

### Actionable Takeaways

We call upon the FIDO alliance, its industry partners, and the security research community to undertake and promote the following two actionable items as applicable:
1. **Inform and Educate Users**: Pursue efforts to inform, educate, and design technologies that persuade users who have configured security keys to only use such keys for login.
2. **Develop New Recovery Schemes**: Develop new recovery schemes that are phishing-resistant and scalable to millions of users. Such schemes may prioritize security guarantees over usability, as recovery is normally performed less frequently, whereas standard 2FA schemes typically prioritize usability for everyday use.
