the user agrees (by tapping the authenticator device) to com-
plete the request displayed on the prompt. The prompt itself
contains a short message, and browsers display it as a native
popup that extends slightly above the address bar. For ex-
ample, Google Chrome captures the TLD and second-level
domains of the website (e.g., google.com), and displays them
to the user within the prompt box alongside the message:
8At the time of this writing, security keys from Yubico (a popular vendor
and FIDO Alliance partner) cost around $20.
Use your security key with google.com
Mozilla Firefox includes the fully qualiﬁed domain name
(e.g., accounts.google.com) in a callout panel as:
accounts.google.com wants to authenticate you
using a registered security key. You can connect
and authorize one now, or cancel.
Since the prompt contains a short message and the website’s
domain, rendered in boldface in Firefox, it can potentially
alert visitors of a phishing website.
Limitation: users’ susceptibility to social engineering.
Relying on users to notice the domain mismatch is not a reli-
able countermeasure for three reasons. First, FIDO promises
to relieve users’ from the burden of detecting phishing, hence
security should not depend on prompts or visual indicators.
Second, previous research [6, 7, 19, 81] have shown that users
typically do not pay attention or understand browser hints re-
lated to security. Third, the adversary can use the U2F API to
interact with the device, which does not trigger such prompt
windows (as we did in our implementation—Sec. 4.1) and
although not tested in our study, previous work shows that
users easily overlook the absence of security cues [77].
8.4 Secure Login and Recovery Alternatives
Doeﬂer et al. [20] discuss Google’s categorization of login,
second factor authentication, and account recovery methods.
Methods of comparable security are placed in the same cat-
egory, and should be allowed depending on the account’s
security status. Such a status could possibly be indicated by
the user’s security conﬁguration (e.g., enabled 2FA, conﬁg-
ured robust recovery methods).
Promising countermeasure. It appears that a viable coun-
termeasure to the attacks discussed herein is: when FIDO
is enabled, only enable authentication (or 2FA) alternatives
that provide resilience to similar attacks that FIDO resists.
Suitable candidate alternatives include other FIDO protocols.
For example, a phone-based authenticator through FIDO2 can
serve as an alternative to physical security keys. This should
be recommended/enforced by service providers (websites). In-
tuitively, a user choosing to register a security key for login is
implicitly requesting resilience to advanced attacks (e.g., real-
time phishing). To that user, a service provider should only
allow alternatives of equivalent defence capabilities.
Login and recovery are two sides of the same coin—
recovery alternatives must also match the security level of
the user-conﬁgured login methods. For example, for a FIDO-
enabled account, recovery through a secondary email that has
weaker security undermines the security of that account. Ham-
mann et al. [37] discuss how account-access graphs could
help users and service providers discover vulnerable paths.

8.5 User Education
Many participants in our study relied on wrong phishing indi-
cators. Several reported that once they click a link in an email,
they wait to see if the visited page is rendered correctly. Partic-
ipant P9-E said, “[...] if the website looks ﬁne, I mean the front
page, I am not suspicious”. Similarly, P20-E mis-classiﬁed
the phishing website as legitimate: “It’s the same because it
looks the same up here [refers to logo section], and I would
be trusting it’s ﬁne”. Others rely solely on the email itself;
participant P18-E said: “I decide before whether to click or
not, and once I click it, it’s opened (done)”. When asked if
she continues checking the visited website, she added: “Not
really”. This is not new; the fact that phishing and similar so-
cial engineering tactics rely on users’ lack of understanding or
incomplete mental models is well established [6, 19]. So long
as authentication relies on user actions, education remains a
plausible (yet somewhat ineffective) countermeasure.
Limitation: impracticality. When available, education
can help users form reasonable mental models of phishing
and may help them detect some attacks. This is an incomplete
countermeasure, however, because it assumes that users are
capable of continuously devoting all of their attention to this
task and that all attacks will have user-noticeable indicators.
Security is rarely users’ primary task [88] and humans are
incapable of remaining highly vigilant 100% of the time. As
we saw in our study, some attacks include sufﬁcient contex-
tual indicators, either by design (e.g., spear phishing) or by
coincidence, to trick even an attentive user who is actively
evaluating for security [6].
Educational campaigns or marketing efforts that promote
security keys as phishing resistant can further contribute to
users forming incorrect mental models [69], and can thus have
adverse effects as users develop a false sense of security and
become less attentive to attacks.
9 Related Work
Phishing is a widely-studied attack vector from the social
engineering category. It uses effective techniques to take over
accounts, fooling even knowledgeable users [19, 26, 43–45].
2FA schemes. The industry and the academic community
has developed several 2FA schemes [48, 50, 57, 58, 68] to
protect users’ accounts. However, real-time phishing is still
very effective to bypass 2FA and automated tools [34] make
such attacks simpler, cheaper, and easy to scale. Previous
works [23,63] report that phishing is widely employed and pre-
ferred by malicious actors, even at hack-for-hire services [63].
FIDO is based on public key cryptography [17] and its
beneﬁts are already demonstrated in a company setting [55].
The protocol itself is considered secure and it is promoted
by the industry as being foolproof phishing-resistant [33].
The research community has focused on the usability aspects
of FIDO [18, 70, 74] but have not questioned its security in
real-world deployments. However, the necessity for alterna-
tive 2FA is already emphasized on previous studies [20, 73]
because users cannot always complete the FIDO step. On the
users side also, the possibility of being locked out is reported
as the main obstacle for using FIDO in daily routine [24, 30].
Anti-Phishing ecosystem. Service providers, browser ven-
dors, and other entities have developed an ecosystem to detect
and prevent phishing, however adversaries adapt their tools
continuously and evade such systems [64–66, 95]. Oest et
al. [67] report that a phishing campaign is detected nine hours
after the ﬁrst victim, hence spear-phishings that target individ-
uals are much more difﬁcult to be prevented by the ecosystem.
Another line of work [25, 39, 59] try to detect malicious web-
sites based on the URL analysis. Email providers have devel-
oped frameworks to ﬁlter out phishing emails before reaching
users [21, 38], however attackers still ﬁnd their way to their
target’s inbox [63]. To limit the consequences of password
reuse [10, 27], prior works have proposed frameworks that al-
low servers to learn when a password is compromised [80,87],
while [52] shows that secure implementation of critical proto-
cols, such as TLS is not trivial for developers.
Client side. Password managers are a possible countermea-
sure to phishing attacks because credentials are released only
if the user visits the correct domain. Blanchou and Youn [9]
were among the ﬁrst to report vulnerabilities in password man-
agers. Others [36, 75] describe the challenges of designing
and implementing secure extensions, while [93] reported that
spooﬁng the sidebar is effective in phishing the master pass-
word as well. Yang et al. [94] measured the effectiveness of
browser indicators, while [71] show that users lose the ability
to detect phishing some period after training.
10 Concluding Remarks
OTP-based 2FA schemes are amongst the most common
phishing defences. Being replayable [3], they fail to defend
against real-time phishing, where the adversary relays user-
submitted OTPs to the legitimate site in real-time. The FIDO
alliance has designed challenge-response mechanisms with
browser involvement, which enables the inclusion of a web-
site’s URL in the challenge. Relaying the response becomes
useless, and real-time phishing is thus defeated. U2F is one
such standard, where the response is computed on a hard-
ware token. To handle token loss/malfunction, websites often
allow/force users to register 2FA alternatives to FIDO. All
FIDO-supporting websites in Alexa’s top 100 adopt the prac-
tice. We ran a user study to test whether a phishing attack
that downgrades FIDO to weaker alternatives is effective. Al-
though the study tested U2F tokens, ﬁndings (particularly re-
garding downgrade effectiveness) can extend to other relevant
FIDO speciﬁcations. We make the following four remarks.
User studies that evaluate attacks must be gracefully
executed. Evaluating attacks through user studies is challeng-
ing. Participants may fall for said attacks during the study, not

because of successful deception, but rather due to participants’
lack of investment in protecting assets or misinterpretation
of study requirements. If participants’ actions were the sole
metric, we would have misidentiﬁed 88% (instead of 55%) of
participants as susceptible to our attacks (Table 2). Such stud-
ies followed by semi-structured interviews delicately gauging
explanations of participants’ actions, without calling attention
to said attacks, provide richer results.
Even with FIDO, users remain susceptible to real-time
phishing that downgrades FIDO to weaker alternatives.
Most participants failed to detect our phishing attacks. Those
who succeeded (10%) have done so without FIDO’s help.
We found no case where a participant was close to fall for
real-time phishing, but FIDO protected them. Our social en-
gineering involved displaying the FIDO-prompt to users (its
result is discarded), followed by a prompt for another 2FA
alternative (its result would be relayed to the legitimate server
in practice). This amassed to what appeared to participants as
a three-factor login, giving an increased sense of (false) secu-
rity rather than arousing suspicion. The effect of such attacks
in practice is exacerbated by two points: (1) users can become
less careful seeing more factors, and (2) reassuring wording
on login pages (e.g., Google’s statement on 2FA pages “This
extra step shows that it’s really you trying to sign in”).
Despite understanding how to use FIDO [30], users
do not understand how FIDO protects them. While dis-
cussing how they detected our attacks, no participant men-
tioned relying on FIDO. FIDO protects users when login is
granted after using only FIDO, not after using FIDO plus other
factors. The former prevents real-time phishing and down-
grade attacks, the latter enables them. As it is counter-intuitive,
no participant appears to have assimilated this concept.
Enabling only FIDO alternatives to FIDO is an effec-
tive countermeasure. To address the necessity of allowing
alternatives to FIDO’s U2F, without enabling downgrade at-
tacks, websites should only allow alternatives of comparable
security. Many of the other countermeasures we explored
would either expose users to lockouts due to token losses, or
continue to make users potentially susceptible to other social
engineering variations. Relevant FIDO speciﬁcations that are
also resilient to real-time phishing (e.g., CTAP2) appear to be
suitable alternatives from a security perspective.
Actionable Takeaways. We call upon the FIDO alliance,
its industry partners, and the security research community to
undertake and promote the following two actionable items as
applicable: (a) to pursue efforts to inform, educate, and design
technologies that persuade users who have conﬁgured security
keys to only use such keys for login; and (b) develop new
recovery schemes that are phishing-resistant and scalable to
millions of users. For the latter, such schemes may prioritize
security guarantees over usability, as recovery is normally
performed less frequently, whereas standard 2FA schemes
typically prioritize usability for everyday use.
