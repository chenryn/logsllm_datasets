Abstract—Network anomaly detection aims to detect patterns 
in  a  given  network  traffic  data  that  do  not  conform  to  an 
established  normal  behavior.  Distinguishing  different  anomaly 
patterns from large amount of data can be a challenge, let alone 
visualizing  them  in  a  comparative  perspective.  Recently,  the 
unsupervised  learning  method  such  as  the  K-means  [3],  self-
organizing  map  (SOM)  [2],  and  growing  hierarchical  self-
organizing  map  (GHSOM)  [1]  have  been  shown  to  be  able  to 
facilitate network anomaly detection [4][5]. However, there is no 
study  addressing  both  mining  and  detecting  task.  This  study 
leverages  the  advantage  of  GHSOM  to  analyze  the  network 
traffic data and visualize the distribution of attack patterns with 
hierarchical  relationship.  In  the  mining  stage,  the  geometric 
distances  between  each  pattern  and  its  descriptive  information 
are revealed in the topological space. The density and the sample 
size of each node can help to detect anomalous network traffic. In 
the  detecting  stage,  this  study  extends  the  traditional  GHSOM 
and  uses  the  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  [6]  to  classify 
network traffic data into the predefined categories. The proposed 
approach  achieves  (1)  help  understand  the  behaviors  of 
anomalous network traffic data (2) provide effective classification 
rule to facilitate network anomaly detection and (3) accumulate 
network  anomaly  detection  knowledge  for  both  mining  and 
detecting purpose. The public dataset and the private dataset are 
used to evaluate the proposed approach. The expected result is to 
confirm  that  the  proposed  approach  can  help  understand 
network traffic data, and the detecting mechanism is effective for 
identifying anomalous behavior.

INTRODUCTION 
An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device or software 
application  that  monitors  network  or  system  activities  for 
malicious activities or policy violations and produces reports to 
a  management  station.  Most  IDS  use  network  anomaly 
detection to detect patterns in a given network traffic data that 
is unusual to an established normal behavior. Because different 
services  are  enabled  across  the  network  environment,  this 
increases  the  chances  of  various  potential  cyber  attacks. 
Analysis  of  periodical  network  traffic  data  is  essential  to 
develop  a  knowledge-based  IDS  and  a  behavior-based  IDS. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, little or no research has 
been  performed  so  far  to  both  explore  the  relationships  of 
different  forms  of  network  attack,  and  develop  an  approach 
which  is  capable  of  doing  network  forensics  and  network 
anomaly detection.  
For network forensics, unsupervised learning methods can 
help doing data clustering to observe different types of network 
attacks.  Palomo  et  al.  [4]  use  growing  hierarchical  self-
organizing map (GHSOM) to cluster network traffic data and 
the results confirm that the GHSOM is very useful for a better 
understanding  of  network  traffic  data,  making  it  easier  to 
search  for  evidence  of  attacks  or  anomalous  behavior  in  a 
network environment. For network anomaly detection, Tjhai et 
al. [5] develop a two stage classification system using a SOM 
neural network and K-means algorithm to correlate the related 
alerts and to further classify the alerts into classes of true and 
false  alarms.  Preliminary  experiments  confirm  the  proposed 
approach can effectively reduce all superfluous and noisy alerts. 
This study leverages the advantage of GHSOM to analyze 
the network traffic data and visualize the distribution of attack 
patterns  with  hierarchical  relationship.  The  flexible  and 
hierarchical  features  in  GHSOM  lead  to  more  intricate 
clustering results than SOM. Based on the built GHSOM, this 
study  develops  an  intrusion  detection  mechanism  which 
utilizes the support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier, and 
gathers  the  distinctive  features  of  each  node  to  generate  the 
classification rules. 
The  main  design  purpose  is  to  use  GHSOM  to  cluster 
network traffic data and to represent it in different angle so that 
it  can  aid  in  network  forensics,  and  to  utilize  the  observed 
anomalous behaviors for network anomaly detection. 
II.  GROWING HIERARCHICAL SELF-ORGANIZING MAP 
The  GHSOM  training  process  contains  the  following  four 
phases [1]:  
1. Initialize layer 0: Layer 0 includes a single node, the weight 
vector  of  which  is  initialized  as  the  expected  value  of  all 
input data. The mean quantization error of layer 0 (MQE0) 
is  calculated  next.  The  MQE  of  a  node  denotes  the  mean 
quantization  error  that  sums  the  deviation  between  the 
weight vector of the node and all input data mapped to the 
node. 
2. Train each individual map: Under the competitive learning

principle, only the winner and its neighboring nodes qualify 
for adjustment of their weight vectors. The competition and 
training  processes  are  repeated  until  the  learning  rate 
decreases to a certain value. 
3. Grow  each  individual  map  horizontally:  Each  individual 
map grows until the mean value of the MQE for all nodes 
on the map, i.e., avg(MQE), is smaller than the MQE of the 
parent node (MQEp) multiplied by τ1, as in (1). If the stop 
criterion is not satisfied, we find the error node that owns 
the  largest  MQE  and  insert  one  row  or  column  of  new 
nodes between the error node and its dissimilar neighbor. 
avg(MQE) < τ1 × MQEp 
       (1) 
4. Expand  or  terminate  the  hierarchical  structure:  The  node 
with  an  MQEi  greater  than  τ2  ×  MQE0  will  be  used  to 
develop the next layer, as in (2). 
MQEi < τ2 × MQE0 
                   (2) 
III.  PROPOSED APPROACH 
The  proposed approach  is  shown  as  Fig.  1.  The proposed 
approach  consists  of  two  stages:  the  mining  stage  and  the 
identifying stage. These two stages can be integrated into the 
off-line  intrusion  detection  evaluation,  and  the  obtained 
network  anomaly  detection  knowledge  can  be  integrated  into 
an IDS. 
Fig. 1.  Architecture of the anomaly detection approach 
First,  the  training  samples  are  collected  from  the  network 
traffic  data  through  alert  aggregation.  The  mining  stage 
contains  data  clustering,  data  visualization  and  attack  pattern 
labeling  phase.  In  the  data  clustering  phase,  the  GHSOM  is 
applied  to  cluster  samples  without  knowing  their  pattern  or 
representative  features.  We  tailor  the  GHSOM  by  clustering 
the anomalous network traffic data in order to help reveal the 
features  of  various  attack  behaviors,  and  we  extend  the 
GHSOM to be able to identify anomalous network traffic data 
by  integrating  it  with  a  set  of  classifiers,  which  is  mainly 
designed in the identifying stage. 
The  GHSOM  clustering  results  are  presented  in  the  data 
visualization  phase,  including  input  data  hits,  U-matrix,  and 
component  planes.  In  the  attack  pattern  labeling  phase,  the 
samples  with  anomalous  patterns  are  expected  to  be  grouped 
together, or to be crowded out from the regular majority. Our 
preliminary results confirm that anomalies with similar attack 
patterns  are  usually  grouped  together,  and  the  correlations  of 
the features can be easily recognized. 
The  identifying  stage  comprises  the  attack  classification 
and  performance  evaluation  phase.  The  design  of  attack 
classification and performance evaluation is illustrated in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2.  Attack classification and performance evaluation 
The results of GHSOM consist of several labeled clusters. 
For  each  cluster,  the  represented  features  are  selected  in  the 
feature  extraction  step.  The  features  include  both  network 
traffic  data  and  the  GHSOM  weight  vectors.  Note  that  the 
weight vectors of a cluster represent the features of a labeled 
class.  Then,  based  on  the  selected  features  of  each  labeled 
cluster,  a  SVM  classifier  is  trained  to  do  the  supervised 
learning. For example, in Fig. 2, there are three types of attack, 
A, B, C, which are labeled in the previous stage. Then, three 
SVM classifiers use the extracted features as the input variables 
and start training. The rule forming step is design to turn the 
decision  boundaries  of  SVM  classifier  into  readable  and 
interpretable  rule  bases.  Finally,  the  performance  evaluation 
step  evaluates  the  classification  performance  of  the  set  up 
classification  rules.  For  each  sample  of  the  training  data  and 
testing  data,  it  is  first  classified  into  one  cluster  of  the  built 
GHSOM,  and  then  the  associated  classification  rules  are 
applied to check if the sample is within the decision boundaries. 
If not, the sample is put into the “unknown” category. If yes, 
the associated attack is identified. 
In  summary,  the  proposed  use  of  GHSOM  with  SVM 
classifiers seems a promising approach to explore the patterns 
of  anomalous  network  traffic,  which  is  helpful  for  network 
forensics,  and  to  generate  classification  rules  for  network 
anomaly detection, which is able to be integrated into an IDS.
