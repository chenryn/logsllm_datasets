User: If I open a a file as os.open( '/dev/ttyS2', O_RDWR | O_NDELAY ), is there any way that I can check when my 'write()' commands have finished? Or, can I open a file for non-blocking read but blocking write?
Assistant: If you are writing to a tty (as you are in your example), you can use termios.tcdrain to wait until all written bytes have been transmitted.
Your write systems calls will still be non-blocking, so you will need to handle EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN errors, and use select(2), poll(2) or epoll(7) to know when you can write to the file descriptor. These are designed to be used with non-blocking file descriptors.
