tems [23, 51]. Studies focusing on queuing delays usu-
ally rely on RTT percentiles [10, 33]; there is however
no convention to choose speciﬁc quantiles. For instance,
Chandrasekaran et al. [14] deﬁne the 10th percentile as
the baseline RTT and the 90th percentile as spikes (i.e.
sudden RTT increases), in the same study they also
report results for the 5th and 95th percentiles.
We monitor the median RTT (i.e. 50th percentile)
which accounts for high delays only if they represent
the majority of the RTT samples. Section 4.2 presents
the other robust statistics we employ to analyze RTT
measurements.
Challenge 3: Packet loss. Delay is an important
but insuﬃcient indicator to identify connectivity issues.
In worst-case scenarios networks fail to transmit pack-
ets, and the lack of samples clouds delay measurements.
Increases in delay and packet loss are not necessarily
correlated [33]. Congestion provides typical examples
where both metrics are aﬀected [44], but routers imple-
menting active queue management (e.g. Random Early
Detection [18]) can mitigate this [28], as the routers
drop packets to avoid signiﬁcant delay increase. Other
examples include bursts of lost packets on routing fail-
ure [47]. We stress that a comprehensive analysis of
network conditions must track both network delay and
packet loss.
Packet loss is sometimes overlooked by congestion de-
tection systems. For instance, Pong [17] and TSLP [28]
probe routers to monitor queuing delays, but users are
left with no guidance in the case of lost probes. Con-
sequently, studies using these techniques tend to ignore
incomplete data due to lost packets (e.g. 25% of the
dataset is disregarded in ref. [14]), and potentially miss
major events.
Detecting packet loss is of course an easy task; the key
diﬃculty is to locate where the packets are dropped.
Several approaches have been previously proposed to
address this. The obvious technique is to continuously
probe routers, or networks, and report packet loss or
disconnections [30, 37]. This is, however, particularly
greedy in terms of network resources, hence, diﬃcult to
deploy for long-term measurements. Another approach
employs both passive and active monitoring techniques
to build end-to-end reference paths, passively detect
packet loss, and actively locate path changes [52]. Ap-
proaches using only passive measurements are also pos-
sible; although wide coverage requires collection of ﬂow
statistics from many routers [21].
In Section 5 we introduce a forwarding anomaly de-
tection method that complements the proposed RTT
analysis method (§ 4). It analyzes traceroute data and
creates reference forwarding patterns for each router.
These patterns are used to locate routers that drop
packets in abnormal situations.
Further comparisons with related works are provided
in Appendix A.

IN-NETWORK DELAYS
We now describe our approach to detecting abnormal
delay changes in wide-area traceroute measurements.
To address the traﬃc asymmetry challenge we propose
monitoring a link’s delay using Atlas probes from mul-
tiple ASs (§ 4.1). Then, we use a robust detector to
identify abnormal delay changes (§ 4.2).
4.1 Differential RTT
As stated in Section 3, locating delay changes from
traceroute data is challenging because of traﬃc asym-
metry. We address this challenge by taking advantage of
the topographically-diverse deployment of Atlas probes.
Let’s revisit the example of Figure 1 and introduce
our notation. RT TP B stands for the round-trip-time
from the probe P to the router B. The diﬀerence be-
tween the RTT from P to the two adjacent routers, B
and C, is called diﬀerential RTT and noted ∆P BC. The
diﬀerential RTT of Figure 1b is decomposed as follows:
∆P BC = RT TP C − RT TP B
= δBC + δCD + δDA − δBA
= δBC + εP BC
(1)
(2)
(3)

where δBC is the delay for the link BC and εP BC is the
time diﬀerence between the two return paths.
∆P BC alone gives a poor indication of the delay of
link BC because the two components, δBC and εP BC,
are not dissociable. Nonetheless, these two variables are
independent and controlled by diﬀerent factors. The
value of δBC depends only on the states of routers B
and C, and is unrelated to the monitoring probe P . In
contrast, εP BC is intimately tied to P , the destination
for the two return paths.
Assuming that we have a pool of n probes Pi, i ∈
[1, n], all with diﬀerent return paths from B and C;
then, the diﬀerential RTTs for all probes, ∆PiBC, share
the same δBC but have independent εPiBC values. The
independence of εPiBC also means that the distribution
of ∆PiBC is expected to be stable over time if δBC is
constant. In contrast, signiﬁcant changes in δBC inﬂu-
ence all diﬀerential RTT values and the distribution of
∆PiBC shifts along with the δBC changes. Monitoring
these shifts allows us to discard uncertainty from return
paths (εPiBC) and focus only on delay changes for the
observed link (δBC).
Now let’s assume the opposite scenario where B al-
ways pushes returning packets to A, the previous router
on the forwarding path (see link AB in Fig. 1). In this
case εP represents the delay between B and A; hence,
Equation 3 simpliﬁes as:
∆P AB = δAB + δBA.
(4)
Meaning the diﬀerential RTT ∆P AB stands for the de-
lays between router A and B in both directions. This
scenario is similar to the one handled by TSLP [28], and
in the case of delay changes, determining which one of
the two directions is aﬀected requires extra measure-
ments (see [28] Section 3.4).
In both scenarios, monitoring the distribution of dif-
ferential RTTs detects delay changes between the ad-
jacent routers. Note that we are looking exclusively
at diﬀerential RTT ﬂuctuations rather than their ab-
solute values. The absolute values of diﬀerential RTTs
can be misleading; as they include error from return
paths, they cannot account for the actual link delay. In
our experiments we observe negative diﬀerential RTTs,
∆P XY < 0, meaning that Y has a lower RTT than X
due to traﬃc asymmetry (see Fig. 7c and 7d).
4.2 Delay change detection
The theoretical observations of the previous section
are the fundamental mechanisms of our delay change de-
tection system. Namely, the system collects all tracer-
outes initiated in a 1-hour time bin and performs the
following ﬁve steps: (1) Compute the diﬀerential RTTs
for each link (i.e. pair of adjacent IP addresses observed
in traceroutes). (2) Links that are observed from only
a few ASs are discarded. (3) The diﬀerential RTT dis-
tributions of the remaining links are characterized with
nonparametric statistics, (4) and compared to previ-
ously computed references in order to identify abnor-
mal delay changes. (5) The references are updated with
the latest diﬀerential RTT values. The same steps are
repeated to analyze the subsequent time bins. The re-
mainder of this section details steps for handling dif-
ferential RTTs (i.e. steps 1, 3, 4, and 5). Step 2 is a
ﬁltering process to discard links with ambiguous diﬀer-
ential RTTs and is discussed later in Section 4.3.
4.2.1 Differential RTT computation
The ﬁrst step is calculating the diﬀerence between
RTT values measured for adjacent routers. Let X and
Y be two adjacent routers observed in a traceroute initi-
ated by the probe P . The traceroute yields from one to
three values for RT TP X and RT TP Y . The diﬀerential
RTT samples, ∆P XY are computed for all possible com-
binations RT TP Y − RT TP X ; hence, we have from one
to nine diﬀerential RTT samples per probe. In the fol-
lowing, all diﬀerential RTTs obtained with every probe
are denoted ∆XY , or ∆ when confusion is not likely.
4.2.2 Differential RTTs characterization
This step characterizes the distributions of diﬀeren-
tial RTTs ∆XY obtained in the previous step, in or-
der to compute a normal reference and detect signif-
icant deviations from it.
In practice, these anomalies
are detected using a variant of the Central Limit The-
orem (CLT). The original CLT states that, regardless
the distribution of ∆XY , its arithmetic mean is nor-
mally distributed if the number of samples is relatively
large.
If the underlying process changes, in our case
the delays for X and Y , then the resulting mean values
deviate from the normal distribution and are detected
as anomalous.
Our preliminary experiments suggest that the fre-
quent outlying values found in RTT measurements greatly
aﬀect the computed mean values; thus an impractical
number of samples is required for the CLT to hold. To
address this we replace the arithmetic mean by the me-
dian. This variant of the CLT is much more robust to
outlying values and requires less samples to converge
to the normal distribution [49]. Figure 2 depicts the
hourly median diﬀerential RTTs (black dots) obtained
for a pair of IP addresses from Cogent networks (AS174)
during two weeks in June 2015. This link is observed by
95 diﬀerent probes between June 1st and June 15th. The
raw diﬀerential RTT values exhibit large ﬂuctuations;
the standard deviation (σ = 12.2) is almost three times
larger than the average value (µ = 4.8). Despite this
variability, the median diﬀerential RTT is remarkably
steady, all values lie between 5.2 and 5.4 milliseconds
(Fig. 2). Signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations of the median would
indicate trustworthy delay changes on that link.

success p is set to 0.5 in the case of the median, and z
is set to 1.96 for a 95% conﬁdence level. The Wilson
score provides two values, hereafter called wl and wu,
ranging in [0, 1]. Multiplying wl and wu by the number
of samples gives the rank of the lower and upper bound
of the conﬁdence interval, namely l = nwl and u = nwu.
For example, let ∆(1), ..., ∆(n) be the n diﬀerential
RTT values obtained for a single link, and assume these
values are ordered, i.e. ∆(1) ≤ ∆(2) ≤ ... ≤ ∆(n). Then,
for these measures the lower and upper bound of the
conﬁdence interval are given by ∆(l) and ∆(u).
Based solely on order statistics, the Wilson score pro-
duces asymmetric conﬁdence intervals in the case of
skewed distributions, which are common for RTT distri-
butions [19]. Further, unlike a simple conﬁdence inter-
val based on the standard deviation, this non-parametric
technique takes advantage of order statistics to discard
undesirable outliers.
The whiskers in Figure 2 depict the conﬁdence in-
tervals obtained for the Cogent link discussed above.
These intervals are consistent over time and show that
the median diﬀerential RTT for this link reliably falls
between 5.1 and 5.5 milliseconds. The large conﬁdence
interval reported on June 1st illustrates an example
where RTT measures are noisier than other days; yet
we stress that the median value and conﬁdence inter-
val are compatible with those obtained by other time
bins. The following section describes how we identify
statistically deviating diﬀerential RTTs.
4.2.3 Anomalous delays detection
A delay change results in a diﬀerential RTT distri-
bution shift; therefore a signiﬁcant change in the cor-
responding median diﬀerential RTT value. Assume we
have a reference median and its corresponding 95% con-
ﬁdence interval that represents the usual delay mea-
sured for a certain link (the calculation of such refer-
ence is addressed in § 4.2.4). To measure if the diﬀer-
ence between an observed median and the reference is
statistically signiﬁcant we examine the overlap between
their conﬁdence intervals. If the two conﬁdence inter-
vals are not overlapping, we conclude that there is a
statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two me-
dians [41] so we report the observed median as anoma-
lous. As a rule of thumb we discard anomalies where
the diﬀerence between the two medians is lower than
1ms (in our experiments these account for 3% of the re-
ported links). Although statistically meaningful, these
small anomalies are less relevant for the study of net-
work disruption.
The deviation from the normal reference is given by
the gap between the two conﬁdence intervals. Let ¯∆(l)
and ¯∆(u) be, respectively, the lower and upper bound of
the reference conﬁdence interval and ¯∆(m) the reference
median. Then, the deviation from the normal reference

Figure 2. Q-Q plots of the median and mean
diﬀerential RTT versus a normal distribution.
We conﬁrm that the employed CLT variant holds very
well with diﬀerential RTTs. Figure 3a compares the
quantiles of the computed medians to those of a normal
distribution. As all points are in line with the x = y
diagonal, the computed median diﬀerential RTTs ﬁt a
normal distribution quite well. In contrast, the mean
diﬀerential RTT is not normally distributed (Fig. 3b).
By manually inspecting the raw RTT values, we found
125 outlying values (i.e.
greater than µ + 3σ) that
greatly alter the mean. These outliers are isolated events
spread throughout the two weeks, and are attributed
to measurement errors. Despite the large number of
probing packets going through this link, the mean dif-
ferential RTTs are greatly altered by these few outliers.
These observations support our choice for the median
CLT variant against the original CLT.
To account for uncertainty in the computed medians,
