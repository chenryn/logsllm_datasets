that a proof of k says s ◦ [u1, u2] can be used to justify an assumption of the equivalent
judgmental form k claims s ◦ [u1, u2].
The rule (interI) is used to establish interpreted predicates. It states that an inter-
preted atomic formula i is provable if it holds in the abstract logical representation of the
environment E. The proof term sinjI has no speciﬁc structure; it is merely a marker
which means that a procedure must be invoked to check i in the prevailing environment.
Its dual rule (interE) states that any proof of i ◦ [u1, u2] justiﬁes the addition of i to
the environment. In particular, the time interval [u1, u2] associated with an interpreted
predicate is meaningless. Rules (consI) and (consE) are similar but they are used to
establish and eliminate constraints reiﬁed as formulas.

b, u(cid:48)
Explanation of views. The use of views α is unique to BL, at least in the context
of authorization logics, and we would like to explain it further.
In general, a view
α = k, ub, ue can be thought of as consisting of two components: the principal k and
the interval [ub, ue]. Since a view changes only in the rule (saysI), the view k, ub, ue on
any sequent in a proof is determined by the most recently encountered goal judgment
(k says s) ◦ [ub, ue]. The importance of the view is that it prevents the use of any
assumptions of the form k(cid:48) claims s(cid:48) ◦ [u(cid:48)
e] unless either (a) the view changes due to
another (saysI) rule, or (b) k(cid:48) is stronger than k and [u(cid:48)
e] is a superset of the interval
[ub, ue]. These are forced by the premises of the rule (claims).
Restriction (b) is important in practice. Suppose we try to establish the goal
(admin says may(Alice, /secret.txt, read)) ◦ [2009, 2011] to allow Alice to read ﬁle /secret.txt
from 2009 to 2011. The use of views ensures that (unless a (saysI) is encountered in a
subgoal), this proof will only depend on credentials and policies that are (1) created by
principals stronger than admin, and (2) valid on intervals that include [2009, 2011]. If
we omit principals from views, we might violate (1), allowing principals without proper
authority to inﬂuence an authorization. If we omit intervals from views, we run the risk
of allowing expired credentials or those that are applicable in the future to aﬀect an
authorization. Neither of these is desirable. On a more formal note, we expect that the
use of views in BL will lead to strong non-interference theorems, like those established
for an earlier logic without explicit time [18], allowing us to formalize these intuitions.

A.1 Meta-Theory
We prove some interesting meta-theoretic properties of BL, including those mentioned
in Section 3.
In order to prove these properties we make the following assumptions
about decision procedures for constraints and interpreted predicates. In particular, we
allow free parameters (constants) in the judgments Ψ |= c and E |= i, and assume that
the decision procedures treat these parameters universally, i.e, truth of judgments is
closed under substitution of these parameters by ground terms. This is formalized by
the assumptions (Substitution-cons) and (Substitution-state) below.
1. (Hypothesis) Ψ, c |= c.
2. (Weakening-cons) Ψ |= c implies Ψ, c(cid:48) |= c.
3. (Cut-cons) Ψ |= c and Ψ, c |= c(cid:48) imply Ψ |= c(cid:48).
4. (Substitution-cons) Ψ |= c implies Ψ[t/v] |= c[t/v].
5. (Reﬂ-time) Ψ |= u ≤ u.
6. (Trans-time) Ψ |= u ≤ u(cid:48) and Ψ |= u(cid:48) ≤ u(cid:48)(cid:48) imply Ψ |= u ≤ u(cid:48)(cid:48).
7. (Reﬂ-prin) Ψ |= k (cid:23) k.
8. (Trans-prin) Ψ |= k (cid:23) k(cid:48) and Ψ |= k(cid:48) (cid:23) k(cid:48)(cid:48) imply Ψ |= k (cid:23) k(cid:48)(cid:48).
9. (Weakening-state) E |= i implies E, E(cid:48) |= i
10. (Cut-state) E |= i and E, i |= i(cid:48) imply E |= i(cid:48).
11. (Substitution-state) E |= i implies E[t/v] |= i[t/v].
Deﬁnition A.1. Let α = k, ub, ue and α(cid:48) = k(cid:48), u(cid:48)
stronger than α(cid:48) under constraints Ψ, written Ψ |= α ≥ α(cid:48) if the following hold:
b, u(cid:48)
e be two views. We say that α is
1. Ψ |= k (cid:23) k(cid:48)
2. Ψ |= ub ≤ u(cid:48)
e ≤ ue
3. Ψ |= u(cid:48)

Lemma A.1 (View Subsumption). Let M :: Σ; Ψ; E; Γ α−→ s ◦ [u1, u2] and suppose
Ψ |= α ≥ α(cid:48). Then M :: Σ; Ψ; E; Γ α(cid:48)−→ s ◦ [u1, u2] by a derivation of equal or smaller
depth.4
Proof. By induction on the given derivation of M :: Σ; Ψ; E; Γ α−→ s ◦ [u1, u2], case
analyzing the last rule.
Case. M1 :: Σ; Ψ; E; Γ α−→ s1 ◦ [u1, u2]

We have:
4The depth of a derivation is deﬁned as the maximum number of rules of Figures 4 and 5 on the
unique path from the ﬁnal sequent to any leaf.

reapply the rule.
