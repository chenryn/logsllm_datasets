**How to Enable Audit Failure Logs in Active Directory**

I have a user account that keeps getting locked out, and I am trying to determine the cause. As a first step, I want to enable failure audits in the Event Viewer on my Domain Controller (DC). However, I am unsure how to do this.

**Question:**
How can I enable Audit Failures so that they appear in the DC's Event Viewer under "Windows Logs > Security"?

**Steps Taken So Far:**

1. **On the DC:**
   - Open the Group Policy Management Editor.
   - Navigate to `Default Domain Policy (Linked) > Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Local Policies > Audit Policy`.
   - Set the following policies to "Failure":
     - Audit account logon events
     - Directory services access
     - Logon events
   - Note: The "Account management" policy is already set to "Success, Failure".

2. **Update Group Policy:**
   - Open Command Prompt on the DC.
   - Type `gpupdate` and press Enter to apply the changes.

Despite these steps, the Event Viewer still only shows "Audit Success" events, even though it is evident that my user account is receiving bad password attempts every few minutes.

**Additional Information:**
To ensure the settings apply specifically to the Domain Controllers, you should make the changes in the "Default Domain Controllers Policy" instead of the "Default Domain Policy."
