User: How to use iptables firewall to open specified port for Linux server?
Assistant: To use the iptables firewall to open the specified port for the Linux server, the following steps are required: 1. Confirm that iptables has been installed and enabled Use the following command to check whether iptables is installed and running: ``` sudo service iptables status ``` If "iptables: Firewall is not running.", you need to install and enable iptables first. 2. Add ports that need to be opened Use the following command to add ports that need to be opened, for example, open port 8080: ``` sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT ``` This command will add to the iptables INPUT chain A rule that allows requests from port 8080 of the TCP protocol to pass. 3. Save the iptables configuration Use the following command to save the current iptables configuration as a permanent configuration, so as not to reset iptables after restarting: ``` sudo service iptables save ``` This command writes the current rules into the /etc/sysconfig/iptables file. 4. Restart the iptables service Use the following command to restart the iptables service to make the new configuration take effect: ``` sudo service iptables restart ``` After restarting, the server will open the specified port. Attachment: If you need to close the access to the specified port, use the following command to delete the rule of the specified port: ``` sudo iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT ```
