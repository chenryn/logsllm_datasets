title:blackhat:us-19 New Vulnerabilities in 5G Networks
The security in the 5G network has evolved and is more efficient than the previous generations. In this talk, we visit security features of 5G radio networks and reveal new vulnerabilities affecting both the operator infrastructure and end-devices (including mobiles, NB-IoT, laptop etc). We demonstrate how these new vulnerabilities in the 5G/4G security standards can be exploited using low-cost hardware and software platforms. In particular, we introduce a new automated tool to carry out practical evaluation and share data-sets with the research community. In addition, we reveal implementation issues in hundreds of 4G base stations around the world and in commercially available NB-IoT protocols that can be used to mount battery draining, hijacking and bidding down attacks. Our attacks affect to the range from gigabit high speed LTE devices to NB-IoT devices.
