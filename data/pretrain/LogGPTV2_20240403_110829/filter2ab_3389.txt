**Title: New Vulnerabilities in 5G Networks at Black Hat US 2019**

While 5G networks have introduced more robust security measures compared to previous generations, they are not immune to vulnerabilities. In this presentation, we will explore the security features of 5G radio networks and uncover new vulnerabilities that affect both the operator infrastructure and end-user devices, such as mobile phones, NB-IoT devices, and laptops.

We will demonstrate how these newly discovered vulnerabilities in 5G and 4G security standards can be exploited using low-cost hardware and software platforms. Specifically, we will introduce an automated tool designed for practical evaluation, and we will share our data sets with the research community to facilitate further investigation.

Additionally, we will highlight implementation issues found in hundreds of 4G base stations worldwide and in commercially available NB-IoT protocols. These issues can be exploited to launch battery-draining, hijacking, and bidding-down attacks, affecting a wide range of devices from high-speed LTE to NB-IoT.

Our findings underscore the importance of continuous security assessments and the need for proactive measures to protect both network infrastructure and end-user devices.
