### System info
  * Playwright Version: [v1.34.3]
  * Operating System: [Windows 10, Debian 11]
  * Browser: [All]
  * Other info: I use remote.ssh extension on my Debian 11. X Server send Display information to my Windows via VcXsrv or X410
**Config file**
    default
**Test file (self-contained)**
    default
**Steps**
  * Run in UI mode via remote ssh connection
  * Click Open in VS Code icon on any test
**Actual/Expected**
The UI send a link to xdg-open and receive my Windows the following link
format:  
`vscode-remote://ssh-
remote+connectionName/path/to/example.spec.ts/vscode:/file//path/to/example.spec.ts:7:17`  
It's wrong, Windows cannot recognize vscode-remote url shema.
The correct url format is the following:  
`vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-
remote+connectionName/path/to/example.spec.ts:7:17`
