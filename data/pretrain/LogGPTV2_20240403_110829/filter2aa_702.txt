Hack the Textbook
TTBSP
The Problem
• Most security problems are caused by bad code
• Bad code is caused by students not being taught 
how to write good code
• Most programming textbooks have no security 
content
• Many programming textbooks actually teach 
insecure programming practices and/or use 
vulnerable code in their examples 
• Instructors have to teach what is in the textbooks
• Most programming instructors are not security experts
• Instructors are evaluated on how closely they follow the 
textbooks in a course

Fixing It
• Industry View
• Students should be taught good software 
development practices in school
• Tired of having to retrain new graduates
• Academic View
• Not a real issue
• Publishers would be pressuring authors to change their 
textbooks if there was a real need
• Students should be learning theory, not application
• No resources
• Not every instructor is a security expert
• Not enough class time to add material to courses

The Project
• Long Term Objectives
• To make secure software development practices the 
standard way programming is taught
• To make security an integral part of every computer 
science course
• To become a resource that textbook authors and 
classroom instructors can use to stay up-to-date on 
the latest software security issues
