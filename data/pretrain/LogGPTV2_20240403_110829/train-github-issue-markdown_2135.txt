`Finder::ignoreVCS()` is great at ignoring file patterns for the files created
by popular VCS systems.
However, it would be great to be able to instruct `Finder` to actually exclude
the paths excluded by `.gitignore`.
So if we have `.gitignore`:
    vendor/
    cache/
    Finder::create()
    	->files()
        ->ignoreVCS(true) // ignoreVCSIgnored(true); // <--- Ignores vendor/ and cache/
I think this would simplify a lot of Finder configurations which currently
manually exclude the git-ignored paths or manually include everything else.
