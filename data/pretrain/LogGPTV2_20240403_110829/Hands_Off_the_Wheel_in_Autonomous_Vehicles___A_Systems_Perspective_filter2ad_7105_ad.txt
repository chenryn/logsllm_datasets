in Section V-B, where we deal with accidents.
Last, we consider disengagements by modality of occurrence,
i.e., whether the disengagement was initiated automatically by
the AV, or manually by the driver, or as part of a planned
fault injection campaign. Table V lists the distribution of
these modalities across multiple manufacturers. We observe
that an average of 48% of all disengagements are initiated
automatically by the system. Note that this measurement is
biased by manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo that
report a larger number of disengagements.
3) Question 3: Dynamics of AV Disengagements
As suggested by Fig. 5, we expect that AV technology
(including perception, decision, and control) gets tuned over
time, resulting in decreasing DPMs. This hypothesis is true to
varying degrees across manufacturers. In this section, we further
assess its validity. In particular we look at 1) the temporal
dynamics of DPMs (i.e., does DPM decrease with time?), and
2) the dynamics of DPM with the cumulative number of miles
driven (i.e., does DPM decrease with more extensive testing?).
Temporal Trends. Fig. 7 illustrates the temporal dynamics
of the distribution of DPM per car across manufacturers
aggregated per year. First, we observe that there is a distinct
decreasing trend for the median DPM across most manufactur-
ers. Some manufacturers, like Bosch that show an increase in
median DPM per year claim that their disengagements result
from planned fault injection experiments (see Table V). In fact,
some manufacturers show a decrease of as much as 10× in
median DPM across the three-year analysis window. Second,
we see a signiﬁcant increase in the variance of the DPM across
cars over the period of interest. This increase suggests that the
median performance improves over time. However, the worst-
case performance does not, since the variance relative to the
median is large. In fact, for some manufacturers, like Delphi,
the 75th percentile DPM across years changes by less than
50%. Waymo is an exception to this trend, demonstrating a
nearly 8× decrease in median DPM with a signiﬁcant decrease
in variance across the three years of measurement. Recall from
Question 1 that Waymo is still not approaching the asymptote.
Trend with Cumulative Miles Driven. While the temporal
trends are important, an alternative approach is to look at
disengagements per mile as a function of miles driven. Since
manufacturers do not all drive the same number of autonomous
miles each month, this measure is a more equitable analysis
of the AVs across manufacturers. Aggregating across all
manufacturers, we observe that there is a strong negative
correlation between DPM and cumulative miles driven (as
the log(DP M ) and
shown in Fig. 8). We observe that

control of the vehicle”.6 The case studies we presented in
Section II highlight the need for the human driver in the AV to
be alert and cognizant of the environment. The reaction times
provide an understanding of how quickly an individual would
react to a fault, and hence are essential for accident avoidance.
Fig. 10 gives the distribution of test drivers’ reaction times
across all manufacturers. We observe an average 0.85 s reaction
time across all test vehicle drivers and all manufacturers. This
observation is consistent with a similar observation made in
[34]. Further, the distribution of reaction times is long-tailed.
For example, Volkswagen reported at least one case with a
near 4 hr reaction time for a disengagement; we suspect that
this is an incorrect measurement, but cannot conﬁrm. Fig. 11
shows this long-tailed behavior with an Exponential-Weibull ﬁt
for the reported data for manufacturers other than Volkswagen.
Comparison to Human Alertness Levels. To understand
whether that behavior is indeed representative of human
alertness levels when driving, we compare those results with
those presented in [35] for non-AVs. [35] found the reaction
time for braking in test vehicles to be 0.82 s. This observation
is consistent with our study. Further, [35] report
that a
driver’s ownership of a vehicle (i.e., it is his or her own
property) increased reaction time by approximately 0.27 s.
6We assume the reaction times to be upper bounded where they are listed
as ranges.
Figure 9. Evolution of DPM (per car) with the number of cumulative
autonomous miles driven across all cars of that manufacturer. Lines represent
a linear regression ﬁt of each manufacturer’s data.
log(cumulative autonomous miles) are correlated with a Pear-
son coefﬁcient of −0.87 (at a p-value of 7 × 10−56). Fig. 9
shows this relationship across different manufacturers, with
linear regression ﬁt lines describing the trends mentioned
above. That suggests that the manufacturers are continuously
improving their ADSs, with some manufacturers making more
headway than others (as represented by the slope of the ﬁtted
lines). Further, we observe that manufacturers with larger
DPMs seem to make more signiﬁcant improvements over the
same number of miles driven; this suggests that some of the
faults/problems ﬁxed as a result of this testing represent the
“low-hanging fruit.”
While the temporal trends maybe more indicative of how
actual users will drive these cars (i.e., the AVs will be used with
a mix of idle and driving times), the trends with cumulative
miles provide a more robust alternative for comparisons,
wherein the miles driven are the only basis for comparison.
Both show a decreasing trend the ﬁrst shows an increasing
variance; neither shows that any of the cars have approached
a very low or zero DPM regime.
4) Question 4: Driver Alertness Level
The CA DMV deﬁnes reaction time as “the period of time
elapsed from when the autonomous vehicle test driver was
alerted of the technology failure, and the driver assumed manual

disengagements, we use [36] to test the statistical signiﬁcance of
our results. Our calculations for two out of the 4 manufacturers
(i.e., Waymo and GMCruise) were made at > 90% signiﬁcance.
Comparison of APMs across Manufacturers. We observe
that there is great variability (∼ 100×) in APMs across manu-
facturers (see Table VII). For example, Waymo is responsible
for 59.52% of accidents reported (see Table VI), but has
the lowest DPM (7.45 × 10−4), the lowest DPA (18), and
the lowest APM (4.14 × 10−5). In contrast, GMCruise has
a similar DPA (20) but performs 238× worse in terms of
DPM, and 214× worse in terms of APM, as compared to
Waymo (see Table VII). This suggests that there is signiﬁcant
variability across manufacturers in classifying the severity
of disengagements, which again indicates the immaturity of
the current AV technology. Also, the observed APM metric
variability can be partially attributed to test drivers’ proactive
disengagement of the ADS (i.e., manual disengagement as
presented in Section V-A2) to prevent accidents. We compare
the accident rate of AVs with that of manual vehicles using
data for [37], [38], which report that one accident is expected
every 500, 000 miles (i.e., AP M = 2 × 10−6). We ﬁnd that
compared to human drivers, AVs perform 15–22× worse (see
Table VII) in terms of APM.7
When they are calculated using ﬁrst principles (i.e., not using
DPA as done before), for vehicles that can be identiﬁed in
the accident reports, we observe a strong positive correlation
between the number of accidents observed per mile and the
number of autonomous miles driven (with a Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient of 0.98 at p-value < 0.01). Comparing that number
to the trends in the DPM seen in Fig. 8, we see that there
is a much stronger correlation of the APM with cumulative
miles. This behavior might be indicative of the manufacturers’
priority on ﬁxing problems in their ADSs (i.e., they identify
problems relating to accidents and ﬁx them quickly).
Our analysis shows that for the same number of miles driven,
for manufacturers that reported accidents, human-driven cars
(non-AVs) are 15 − 4000× less likely to have an accident than
AVs.
Collision Speeds and Locations. All the accidents reported
in the dataset occurred at low speeds and in the vicinity of
intersections on urban streets. Fig. 12 shows that more than
80% of the accidents occurred when the relative speed8 of the
colliding vehicles was less than 10 mph. In most of the cases
in which the non-AV vehicle was determined to be at fault, the
underlying cause can be attributed to the failure of the vehicle’s
driver to anticipate AV behavior. This observation points to

AVs are required to report any crash on all types of roads.

(b) Waymo
Figure 11. Distribution of reaction times for the Mercedes-Benz and Waymo.
Hence we assume 1.09 s to be the average time for a human
driver in a non-AV to respond any situation on the road.
The observation implies that semi-AVs which are the most
commonly deployed AVs on public streets) would require
continued human supervision and alertness similar to human
controlled non-AVs. Echoing the results of Question 3, that in
turn suggests that the technology may not be mature enough to
allow human drivers to be engaged in other activities, contrary
to what is advertised.
Temporal Behavior of Reaction Time. We ﬁnd that a
driver’s alertness decreases (i.e., reaction time increases) with
the number of cumulative miles driven. At a 99% conﬁdence
level, we observe a positive correlation between the cumulative
miles driven and the reaction times across manufacturers.
For example, Waymo and Mercedes-Benz show a Pearson’s
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.19 (at p-value = 0.01) and 0.11 (at
p-value = 0.007), respectively. Taken together, that observation
and the previous observation about decreasing DPM (described
in Section V-A3) suggest that a driver’s alertness decreases as
the system’s performance improves (i.e., DPM decreases).
Fault Detection Latency and Reaction Time. By deﬁni-
tion, the reaction time does not include fault detection time.
However, as our case studies show, the detection time is indeed
part of the end-to-end time window in which the driver reacts
to an adverse situation. For example, in both case studies
presented in Section II, the primary cause of the accident was
the insufﬁcient time left for the driver to make a decision after
the fault was detected.
The drivers of AVs have to maintain the same level of
alertness as when driving non-AVs. This suggests that the
small size of the overall action window (detection time +
reaction time) can make the reaction-time-based accidents a
frequent failure mode with the widespread deployment of AVs.
We also note that in planned test scenarios for AVs, drivers
are required, trained, and paid to remain continuously attentive
to the activities of the AV. Data for them might not generalize
to regular users.
B. Analysis of AV Accident Reports
1) Question 5: Comparison to Human Drivers
To address this question, we deﬁne two additional measures:
1) accidents per mile (APM), and 2) disengagements per
accident (DPA). We calculate the DPAs as shown in Table VI.
As some of the accident reports were partially redacted by the
CA DMV to obfuscate AV identiﬁcation (e.g., the registration
number or VIN number were removed), we cannot compute
the APM per vehicle directly. We instead compute accidents
per mile using the equation AP M = DP M/DP A. Even though
the number of accidents is small compared to the number of

the need for better understanding of the driving interactions
and behaviors that drivers expect from other on-road vehicles.
Most of the accidents were minor (either rear-end or side-swipe
collisions), and no serious injuries were reported.
Our data show that better situational awareness needs to
be provided by the ADSs (in particular the machine learning
algorithms) to preemptively avoid accidents in a timely fashion.
C. Discussion
1) Comparison to Other Safety-critical Autonomous Systems
Airplanes [39] and surgical robots [40] are safety-critical
semi-autonomous systems that have seen ubiquitous deploy-
ment, as well as a signiﬁcant body of work characterizing
and improving their resilience. We compare AVs to both of
these systems in terms of the accidents per mission (APMi), to
gauge the maturity of AVs vis-a-vis these systems. We deﬁne
a mission as the continuous operation of the system of interest
from the time of commencement to the end of the activity. For
airplanes and cars, a mission is equivalent to one departure
(i.e., trip), and for the surgical robot, a mission is equivalent
to a surgical procedure.
We use data presented in [41] (9.8 accidents per 100, 000
departures for airplanes) and [42] (1043 accidents per 100, 000
procedures for surgical robots) as the baseline for comparison.
We estimate the APMi of an AV by using data (pertaining
to the average length of a vehicle ride on U.S. public roads
for which there is a median of 10 miles per trip) presented
in [43]. Using the APM metric computed earlier as shown
in Table VIII, we compute APMi as APM × length of the
