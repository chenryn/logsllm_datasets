In this section, we analyze disengagements by their modality of occurrence, specifically whether they were initiated automatically by the Autonomous Vehicle (AV), manually by the driver, or as part of a planned fault injection campaign. Table V provides the distribution of these modalities across multiple manufacturers. On average, 48% of all disengagements are initiated automatically by the system. This measurement is influenced by manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo, which report a higher number of disengagements.

### Question 3: Dynamics of AV Disengagements

**Hypothesis**: As AV technology (including perception, decision, and control) improves over time, the Disengagements per Mile (DPM) should decrease. This hypothesis is examined in two ways:
1. **Temporal Dynamics**: Does DPM decrease over time?
2. **Cumulative Miles Driven**: Does DPM decrease with more extensive testing?

#### Temporal Trends
Figure 7 illustrates the temporal dynamics of DPM distributions per car across manufacturers, aggregated annually. We observe a distinct decreasing trend in median DPM for most manufacturers. For example, some manufacturers, such as Bosch, show an increase in median DPM per year due to planned fault injection experiments (see Table V). Notably, some manufacturers have seen a 10× reduction in median DPM over a three-year period. Additionally, there is a significant increase in the variance of DPM across cars, suggesting that while median performance improves, the worst-case performance does not. For instance, Delphi's 75th percentile DPM changes by less than 50% over the years. Waymo, however, demonstrates a nearly 8× decrease in median DPM with a significant reduction in variance over the three years, though it has not yet approached the asymptote.

#### Trend with Cumulative Miles Driven
An alternative approach is to examine DPM as a function of cumulative miles driven. Since manufacturers do not drive the same number of autonomous miles each month, this measure provides a more equitable comparison. Aggregating data across all manufacturers, we find a strong negative correlation between DPM and cumulative miles driven (as shown in Figure 8). The log(DPM) and log(cumulative autonomous miles) are correlated with a Pearson coefficient of -0.87 (p-value = 7 × 10^-56). Figure 9 shows this relationship, with linear regression fit lines indicating continuous improvement in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs). Manufacturers with higher DPMs tend to make more significant improvements over the same number of miles driven, suggesting that initial testing identifies and addresses the "low-hanging fruit" issues.

### Question 4: Driver Alertness Level

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (CA DMV) defines reaction time as the period from when the test driver is alerted of a technology failure to when they assume manual control of the vehicle. Our case studies highlight the importance of driver alertness and situational awareness. Figure 10 shows the distribution of test drivers' reaction times across all manufacturers, with an average reaction time of 0.85 seconds. This is consistent with observations in [34], and the distribution is long-tailed. For example, Volkswagen reported a reaction time of nearly 4 hours, which is likely an incorrect measurement. Figure 11 shows the long-tailed behavior with an Exponential-Weibull fit for other manufacturers.

#### Comparison to Human Alertness Levels
To understand if these reaction times are representative of human alertness, we compare them with results from [35] for non-AVs. [35] found a reaction time of 0.82 seconds for braking in test vehicles, consistent with our study. Additionally, [35] reports that vehicle ownership increases reaction time by approximately 0.27 seconds.

### Summary of Accidents Reported by Manufacturers

Table VI summarizes the accidents reported by manufacturers, including the fraction of total accidents and Disengagements per Accident (DPA).

| Manufacturer | Accidents | Fraction of Total | DPA |
|--------------|-----------|------------------|-----|
| Waymo        | 25        | 59.52%           | 18  |
| Delphi       | 1         | 2.38%            | 572 |
| Nissan       | 1         | 2.38%            | 135 |
| GMCruise     | 14        | 33.33%           | 20  |
| Uber ATC     | 1         | 2.38%            | –   |

### Reliability of AVs Compared to Human Drivers

We define two additional measures: Accidents per Mile (APM) and Disengagements per Accident (DPA). Using first principles, we find a strong positive correlation between the number of accidents per mile and the number of autonomous miles driven (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.98, p-value < 0.01). Comparing APM to DPM trends, we see a stronger correlation with cumulative miles, indicating that manufacturers prioritize fixing problems in their ADSs.

Our analysis shows that for the same number of miles driven, human-driven cars (non-AVs) are 15–4000× less likely to have an accident than AVs. All reported accidents occurred at low speeds and near intersections on urban streets. More than 80% of the accidents involved relative speeds of less than 10 mph, often due to the non-AV driver's failure to anticipate AV behavior.

### Temporal Behavior of Reaction Time

We find that a driver's alertness decreases (i.e., reaction time increases) with the number of cumulative miles driven. At a 99% confidence level, we observe a positive correlation between cumulative miles driven and reaction times across manufacturers. For example, Waymo and Mercedes-Benz show Pearson's correlation coefficients of 0.19 (p-value = 0.01) and 0.11 (p-value = 0.007), respectively. This suggests that as system performance improves (i.e., DPM decreases), driver alertness may decrease.

### Fault Detection Latency and Reaction Time

By definition, reaction time does not include fault detection time. However, our case studies show that detection time is part of the end-to-end response window. In both case studies, the primary cause of the accident was insufficient time for the driver to make a decision after the fault was detected. This highlights the need for continued human supervision and alertness in semi-AVs, similar to non-AVs.

### Comparison to Other Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems

We compare AVs to airplanes and surgical robots in terms of Accidents per Mission (APMi). Using data from [41] and [42], we estimate APMi for AVs using the average length of a vehicle ride on U.S. public roads (median of 10 miles per trip). Table VIII shows the APMi for various manufacturers and their comparison to the aviation industry and surgical robotics.

| Manufacturer | APMi | APMi/SR APM [42] | APMi/Airline APM [41] |
|--------------|------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Waymo        | 4.140 × 10^-4 | 4.22 | 4.22 |
| Delphi       | 4.599 × 10^-4 | 4.41 | 4.59 |
| Nissan       | 3.057 × 10^-3 | 2.93 | 30.2 |
| GMCruise     | 8.843 × 10^-2 | 8.48 | 899.3 |

This comparison indicates that while AVs are improving, they still lag behind other safety-critical systems in terms of reliability.
