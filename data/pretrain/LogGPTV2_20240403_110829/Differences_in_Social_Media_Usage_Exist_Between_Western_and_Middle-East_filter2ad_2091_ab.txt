million users, while Jodel Germany over six times longer time period accumulates
to 3.6 million. Likewise, the amount of interactions equally scales between the
KSA with 1 billion and Germany with 3 billion interactions. This observation
and diﬀerences in adoption allow for putting aggregates, e.g., comparable time
slices, for our study into perspective.
Findings. Adoption pattern and thus associated traﬃc can diﬀer substantially.
4.2 Diﬀerent Adoption Pattern Require Comparable Time Slices
To compare the social media usage in both countries, we need to derive com-
parable datasets. That is, we need to enable comparisons between two diﬀerent
populations of posts, interactions, and users across a multitude of communities.
We thus identify two main dynamics within the lifecycle of communities deﬁning
the aggregation dimension: i) time and ii) per community interaction volume.
Slicing by i) Time. As we are limited in the length of observations, especially
for Saudi Arabia, we selected half-year long timeframes backwards from the end
of observation. We show these timeframes with vertical bars in Fig. 2 named by
country DE0, DE1, ..., DE5, SA0, SA1, where the index indicates the partition’s
age. This simple batching approach creates half-year slices that represent various
416
J. H. Reelfs et al.
stages within the community development. In our study, we compare these slices
independently in each evaluation to account for the diﬀerent adoption processes.
We have experimented with higher resolutions to enrich our results with more
data points (not shown), but our conclusions remain the same for our presented
period length. We handle these partitions independently of each other, i.e., early-
day users from DE5 may drop out of the statistics in subsequent partitions due
to a lack of interactions.
Slicing by ii) Community Interaction Volume. Deﬁning “a” community
is not possible on Jodel given that content is displayed relative to the users
location and thus diﬀers from user to user. That is, every user might experience
a slightly diﬀerent community to interact with, which cannot be reconstructed
from the data. To solve this, we assign each interaction to a nearby major city or
district, which generates clusters of interactions that we refer to as communities.
This discretization generates an approximation of the individually experienced
communities. The resulting approximation is of suﬃcient accuracy to study and
compare the Jodel usage in diﬀerent parts of the respective countries. Further,
the discretization does not normalize for covered area, nor covered population.
We mitigate these inherently hard problems in normalization by simplifying
our partitioning approach. By slicing all interactions into quantiles ordered by
their corresponding community size, we enable a relative comparison; named
is q0 25, ... representing the corresponding quantile of all interactions, dis-
cretized into communities (leading to an approximation). We provide details
of this partitioning in Table 2 describing the amount of discretized communities
per country. That is, e.g., the single largest SA community is the capital Riyadh
at about 30% total interaction volume—hence, it is the only community within
the set of q75 100. Due to dividing the interaction volume into equal parts, we
encounter a heavy-tailed interaction distribution across communities resulting
in only few entries within the upper quantiles; the German community size dis-
tribution qualitatively matches the SA counterpart, while the latter is largely
shifted in volume within magnitudes of fewer communities (not shown).
We will compare the social media usage based on the resulting data sets.

nities. Due to the heavy tailed distribution across the community discretization, the
upper quantiles consist of fewer communities.

5 Geographic Diﬀerences in Jodel Usage: DE vs. KSA
Is there a systematic diﬀerence between Jodel users in Germany and in the KSA
in the way they use the social media platform? In other words, do culture or
country speciﬁc usage behaviors exist that uniquely deﬁne traﬃc proﬁles of the
very same platform in each country? While social media usage has widely been
studied, the question of in-platform variation and behavioral diﬀerences is still
open. In this section, we set out shedding light on this aspect by comparing the
Jodel usage in two countries with a diﬀerent social and cultural background.
We study the question of (cultural) diﬀerences w.r.t. user behavior in Jodel
usage by investigating diﬀerences in active user interactions with Jodel, i.e.,
posting and voting, accounting for all possible active system interactions. We
base this evaluation on two factors introduced in Sect. 4.2: partitioning by i) time
and ii) interaction type, which we discuss next.
(a) Total per user interac-
tions per time period. Per
user interaction volume is
very similar over time.
(b) Per user interactions by time period (DE0, ...) and
interaction type. Over time, we observe increasing en-
gagement. There is a substantial diﬀerence in content
creation and upvote activities between SA and DE.
Fig. 3. Diﬀerences in per-user interactions by time and country. a) While the individual
users behave similar across the board w.r.t. interaction volume, b) attention shifts
towards content creation for the SA user groups, whereas downvoting is less popular
in comparison to DE.
Overall Per-user Activity is Country-Independent. First, we subdivide
all interactions into independent half-year periods as described in Sect. 4.2 (DE0,
. . ., DE5, SA0, SA1). These independent periods enable to compare the behevior
of the networks at diﬀerent times to account for diﬀerences in the adoption
of Jodel in DE and SA. We then aggregate the interactions to each user and
present the resulting interactions per user CDF in Fig. 3a. We show each half-
year period as separate CDF (series) for each of the two countries. Invariant
to time, we observe quite similar heavy tailed distributions; that is, most users
are not very active, such that e.g., 60% of all users each have up to only 100
interactions. The distribution for SA1 deviates from the pattern since it captures
a timeframe before being popular (considerably fewer data points). In general,

vote
(b) Vote interaction distributions by time period (DE0,
...) split by community size (q0 25,...) and being a thread
start (thread) or is a reply buried within a thread.

we observe that irrespective of time and country, users follow a similar usage
behavior—also in absolute terms (not shown).
Diﬀerence: Posting vs. Voting. Next, we further partition the data by the
type of interaction in addition to the time slices used before. That is, we show
distributions of interactions per user subdivided into the voting interactions
(upvoted, downvoted) and content creation interactions (postcreated, replycre-
ated) as a box plot in Fig. 3b. Note the logarithmic y-axis. Further, the whiskers
denote the 5%/95% percentile.
German users tend to increase their engagement over time at increasing plat-
form activity regardless of the interaction type. While upvoting is the most
prominent type of interaction for the German users, voting content down and
replying to content are roughly equally less prominent. The SA users prefer
content creation, especially replying, whereas upvoting happens less frequently.
Remarkably, all time periods within a country are determined by similar
behavior. In other words, posting content is the dominant type of interaction
in the KSA, while it is voting in Germany. This represents a clear diﬀerence in
platform usage that can be observed between these two countries (also regardless
of community size, not shown).
The ratio of up to overall votes remains positive at a happyratio (upvotes to
total votes) of 83% for DE and 71% for SA. The ﬁgures for the SA1 partition need
to be taken with a grain of salt due to only few users; however, the engagement
spread is higher compared to the latest timeframe SA0.
Findings. Invariant to time and community size, the SA users (Middle-East)
behave fundamentally diﬀerent to the DE counterparts (Western country). They
heavily prefer creating content, but vote slightly less than the German users. This
highlights, for the ﬁrst time, that cultural patterns in social media user behavior
exist that create drastic shifts in how a very same social media platform is used in
Diﬀrences in Social Media

each country. This ﬁnding may be considered even more interesting, given Jodel
being an anonymous platform that enables a very pure form of communication;
it entirely focuses on posted content in absence of any user proﬁle.
6 Structural Implications
With the identiﬁed fundamental attention shift in user behavior between SA
and DE users in content creation and voting, we now aim at studying resulting
implications on the platform. According to the operator, the communities in both
countries are considered to be well-functioning. That is, regardless of implications
arising from diﬀerent usage proﬁles, participants are enjoying spending time on
the platform to the most part; e.g., by creating content, voting, or just lurking.
6.1 Content Voting
Accumulated Votes Overview. Votes on posted content have two roles in
Jodel: i) they show content appreciation to others (e.g., enable users to sort
by popularity) and ii) enable distributed user based content moderation that
removes content with negative vote scores (see Sect. 2). Factors inﬂuencing vote
distributions can thus have structural implications on the platform. To study
diﬀerences in voting behavior, we ﬁrst take a look into accumulate vote score
(#upvotes - #downvotes) distributions. There are two given bounds for posts
gathering votes: 1) Posts beyond a negative threshold are no more displayed on
the platform. 2) There is no conscious upper bound given by the system, yet
posts are only temporarily displayed within the various app feeds (see Sect. 2)
(a) Thread w/o replies
over time and response ra-
tio. Most threads can at-
tract replies.
(b) Thread length over time by community size. With
increasing engagement (left, Fig. 5a), communities expe-
rience longer threads on average invariant to community
size.
Fig. 5. Thread engagement with responses - how many & how much. a) At an increas-
ing ratio over time, within recent time periods, most threads attract replies. b) With
growing amounts of interactions over time, the average thread length increases to a
similar level in DE and SA.

and therefore, the time for interacting with them is inherently limited. Given
these constraints, all communities naturally enjoy a rather positive mood. To
put an emphasis on the temporal dimension, we show the CDF of vote scores to
posts over time (DE0, ...) in Fig. 4a. In the earlier times of DE with less activity,
more posts were able to gather more votes as illustrated by the DE3..5 series
resembling a broader distribution. There is a slight decrease of accumulated vote
scores throughout time, hence interactions per post, for the DE communities—
also observed within the KSA. The distributions become more and more long-
tailed over time and appear scale-shifted. Noteworthy, a split into community
sizes conﬁrms this ﬁnding: larger communities may reach far higher absolute
scores, but the distributions become more skewed correlated to the observed
interaction volume (not shown).
Due to SA users producing much more content, the feeds displayed in the
app also get renewed completely at a very high pace. Thus, SA posts compete
harder for time to collect possible votes in comparison to their DE cousins; the
feeds also promote observed long-tails. What implications does this shift have
on experienced vote distributions?
Votes per Post. To better understand the voting interactions and the observed
skew in accumulated vote scores, we next normalize observed ﬁgures to a per-
post basis. The box plots in Fig. 4b show various per post vote interaction dis-
tributions across time (DE0, ...), and community size (q0 25, ...), while further
distinguishing between threads (thread) and replies.
We ﬁnd the long tail of high vote scores in the rather long 95% percentile
whiskers on the log scaled y-axis. Invariant to time and community size, the
median German user enjoys voting on threads with median levels around 10
to 30 votes gathered by each post throughout time. Naturally given by the
communication structure and app design, content buried within threads is much
less appreciated; they accumulate only two to three votes in DE. As discussed
before, the SA posts stand in stark contrast at three to four votes within the
main Q0 timeframe. I.e., opposed to German users, the average participant
within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia cannot expect to receive any vote on her
content—especially and naturally not on replies.
Findings. We show that the availability of more posted content in Saudi Arabia
