#### User Base and Interaction Comparison
Jodel Germany has accumulated 3.6 million users over a period six times longer than that of Jodel in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which has reached 1 million users. Similarly, the number of interactions scales between the KSA, with 1 billion, and Germany, with 3 billion interactions. These observations and differences in adoption allow us to contextualize our study by comparing comparable time slices.

#### Findings
Adoption patterns and associated traffic can vary significantly. 

### 4.2 Different Adoption Patterns Require Comparable Time Slices
To compare social media usage in both countries, we need to derive comparable datasets. This involves comparing different populations of posts, interactions, and users across multiple communities. We identify two main dynamics within the lifecycle of communities that define the aggregation dimension: i) time and ii) per-community interaction volume.

**Slicing by i) Time:**
Given the limited length of observations, especially for Saudi Arabia, we selected half-year timeframes backward from the end of the observation period. These timeframes are denoted by vertical bars in Fig. 2, named DE0, DE1, ..., DE5, SA0, SA1, where the index indicates the partition's age. This batching approach creates half-year slices representing various stages of community development. In our study, we compare these slices independently in each evaluation to account for different adoption processes. We have experimented with higher resolutions to enrich our results with more data points, but our conclusions remain consistent with the presented period length. Each partition is handled independently, meaning early-day users from DE5 may drop out of the statistics in subsequent partitions due to a lack of interactions.

**Slicing by ii) Community Interaction Volume:**
Defining a single community on Jodel is not possible because content is displayed relative to the user's location, leading to different experiences for each user. To address this, we assign each interaction to a nearby major city or district, generating clusters of interactions that we refer to as communities. This discretization provides an approximation of the individually experienced communities, which is sufficiently accurate for studying and comparing Jodel usage in different parts of the respective countries. The discretization does not normalize for covered area or population. By slicing all interactions into quantiles ordered by their corresponding community size, we enable a relative comparison. For example, the single largest SA community, Riyadh, accounts for about 30% of the total interaction volume and is the only community within the set of q75-100. Due to the heavy-tailed distribution of interactions across communities, there are fewer entries in the upper quantiles. The German community size distribution qualitatively matches the SA counterpart, though the latter is shifted in volume with fewer communities (not shown).

We will compare social media usage based on the resulting datasets.

| Interactions Quantile | # Communities (SA) | # Communities (DE) |
|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| ≈75-100               | 6,678              | 12                 |
| ≈50-75                | 114                | 78                 |
| ≈25-50                | 1                  | 14                 |
| ≈0-25                 | 4                  | 29                 |

### 5. Geographic Differences in Jodel Usage: DE vs. KSA
Is there a systematic difference in how Jodel users in Germany and the KSA use the platform? Do cultural or country-specific usage behaviors uniquely define traffic profiles of the same platform in each country? While social media usage has been widely studied, the question of in-platform variation and behavioral differences remains open. In this section, we shed light on this aspect by comparing Jodel usage in two countries with different social and cultural backgrounds.

We investigate differences in active user interactions with Jodel, including posting and voting, accounting for all possible active system interactions. This evaluation is based on two factors: partitioning by i) time and ii) interaction type.

**Fig. 3: Differences in Per-User Interactions by Time and Country**
- **a) Total per-user interactions per time period:** Per-user interaction volume is very similar over time.
- **b) Per-user interactions by time period (DE0, ...) and interaction type:** Over time, we observe increasing engagement. There is a substantial difference in content creation and upvote activities between SA and DE.

**Overall Per-User Activity is Country-Independent:**
First, we subdivide all interactions into independent half-year periods (DE0, ..., DE5, SA0, SA1). These periods enable us to compare network behavior at different times, accounting for differences in Jodel adoption in DE and SA. We then aggregate interactions per user and present the resulting interactions per user CDF in Fig. 3a. Invariant to time, we observe similar heavy-tailed distributions; most users are not very active, with 60% of all users having up to only 100 interactions. The distribution for SA1 deviates from the pattern due to it capturing a timeframe before Jodel became popular. Generally, users follow a similar usage behavior, irrespective of time and country.

**Difference: Posting vs. Voting:**
Next, we further partition the data by the type of interaction in addition to the time slices used before. We show distributions of interactions per user, subdivided into voting interactions (upvoted, downvoted) and content creation interactions (post created, reply created) as a box plot in Fig. 3b. Note the logarithmic y-axis, and the whiskers denote the 5%/95% percentile.

German users tend to increase their engagement over time, regardless of the interaction type. Upvoting is the most prominent type of interaction for German users, while downvoting and replying are roughly equally less prominent. SA users prefer content creation, especially replying, and upvoting happens less frequently. All time periods within a country exhibit similar behavior. In other words, posting content is the dominant type of interaction in the KSA, while voting is dominant in Germany. This represents a clear difference in platform usage between the two countries.

The ratio of upvotes to overall votes remains positive, with a "happy ratio" (upvotes to total votes) of 83% for DE and 71% for SA. The figures for the SA1 partition should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of users; however, the engagement spread is higher compared to the latest timeframe SA0.

**Findings:**
Invariant to time and community size, SA users (Middle-East) behave fundamentally differently from DE counterparts (Western country). They heavily prefer creating content but vote slightly less than German users. This highlights, for the first time, that cultural patterns in social media user behavior exist, creating drastic shifts in how the same social media platform is used in each country. This finding is particularly interesting given that Jodel is an anonymous platform focusing entirely on posted content without any user profile.

### 6. Structural Implications
With the identified fundamental attention shift in user behavior between SA and DE users in content creation and voting, we now aim to study the resulting implications on the platform. According to the operator, the communities in both countries are considered well-functioning, meaning participants enjoy spending time on the platform, whether by creating content, voting, or just lurking.

**6.1 Content Voting**
**Accumulated Votes Overview:**
Votes on posted content in Jodel serve two roles: i) showing content appreciation to others (e.g., enabling users to sort by popularity) and ii) enabling distributed user-based content moderation that removes content with negative vote scores. Factors influencing vote distributions can have structural implications on the platform. To study differences in voting behavior, we first examine the accumulated vote score (#upvotes - #downvotes) distributions. Posts beyond a negative threshold are no longer displayed on the platform, and there is no conscious upper bound, but posts are only temporarily displayed within the app feeds. Given these constraints, all communities naturally enjoy a rather positive mood. To emphasize the temporal dimension, we show the CDF of vote scores to posts over time (DE0, ...) in Fig. 4a. In the earlier times of DE with less activity, more posts were able to gather more votes, as illustrated by the DE3..5 series resembling a broader distribution. There is a slight decrease in accumulated vote scores over time, and the distributions become more long-tailed. A split into community sizes confirms this finding: larger communities may reach higher absolute scores, but the distributions become more skewed correlated to the observed interaction volume.

Due to SA users producing much more content, the app feeds are renewed at a very high pace. Thus, SA posts compete harder for time to collect possible votes compared to DE posts, promoting observed long-tails. What implications does this shift have on experienced vote distributions?

**Votes per Post:**
To better understand the voting interactions and the observed skew in accumulated vote scores, we normalize observed figures to a per-post basis. The box plots in Fig. 4b show various per-post vote interaction distributions across time (DE0, ...), and community size (q0-25, ...), distinguishing between threads and replies.

We find the long tail of high vote scores in the 95% percentile whiskers on the log-scaled y-axis. Invariant to time and community size, the median German user enjoys voting on threads with median levels around 10 to 30 votes gathered by each post. Naturally, content buried within threads accumulates only two to three votes in DE. In contrast, SA posts typically receive three to four votes within the main Q0 timeframe. On average, a participant in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia cannot expect to receive many votes on their content, especially not on replies.

**Findings:**
We show that the availability of more posted content in Saudi Arabia leads to a more competitive environment for collecting votes, resulting in lower median vote counts per post. This highlights the structural implications of different usage patterns on the platform.
