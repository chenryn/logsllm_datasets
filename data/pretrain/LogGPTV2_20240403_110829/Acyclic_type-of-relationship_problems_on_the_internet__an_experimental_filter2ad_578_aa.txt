# Acyclic Type-of-Relationship Problems on the Internet: An Experimental Analysis

**Authors:** Benjamin Hummel and Sven Kosub

## Abstract
This paper presents an experimental study of the feasibility and accuracy of the acyclicity approach, as introduced in [14], for inferring business relationships among autonomous systems (ASes). We investigate the maximum acyclic type-of-relationship problem, which involves finding a maximum-cardinality subset of AS paths that allows an acyclic and valley-free orientation. We present inapproximability and NP-hardness results for this problem and design a heuristic. The heuristic is experimentally compared to state-of-the-art algorithms using a reliable data set. Our findings show that the proposed heuristic produces the least number of misclassified customer-to-provider relationships among the tested algorithms. Additionally, it is flexible in handling pre-knowledge, as even a small amount of correct relationships can produce high-quality relationship classifications. The reliable data set is also used to validate the acyclicity assumptions, demonstrating that acyclicity should be an integral part of models of AS relationships.

## Introduction
The analysis of interrelationships among autonomous systems (ASes) has recently attracted significant attention in both theoretical and practical research on Internet inter-domain routing with BGP (e.g., [8, 19, 18, 7, 4, 14, 6]). This interest is driven by the understanding that routing stability and quality in the Internet are influenced not only by physical connections between ASes but also by their business relationships. As business contracts are private, computational tools and techniques are required to infer realistic relationship classifications from publicly available resources such as WHOIS databases, the Internet Routing Registry [15], or BGP beacons (e.g., [17, 21]).

A useful approach is the interpretation of observable BGP routes. Techniques based on this approach typically involve collecting a set of AS paths from BGP routers, merging these paths to form an AS-level connectivity graph (the AS graph), and labeling the AS graph with business relationships to ensure that as many collected AS paths as possible are valley-free. Valley-freeness is a characteristic property of AS paths based on economic rationality, which states that, in the direction of traffic, a customer-to-provider link should never follow a provider-to-customer link. Implementations range from purely combinatorial (e.g., [4, 14]) to purely heuristic (e.g., [8, 19, 23]). Despite some criticism of unrealistic classifications [7], empirical findings are encouraging for further developments.

In [14], acyclicity was added to valley-freeness as another structural condition for AS graph labelings. The rationale for acyclicity is that it is unlikely for an AS A to be a provider of AS B, AS B to be a provider of AS C, and AS C to be a provider of AS A. It was shown that finding labelings that are both valley-free on the path set and acyclic in the AS graph is feasible, even when respecting explicit pre-knowledge. However, the empirical evidence supporting the acyclicity approach was not provided in [14].

In this paper, we contribute to the experimental analysis of acyclic type-of-relationship problems in three ways:
1. **Operationalization of Acyclicity**: We consider the problem of finding acyclic orientations that maximize the number of valley-free paths. We provide lower bounds on the approximability of this problem, which implies its NP-hardness, and design a fast heuristic for finding acyclic orientations that are valley-free on a large part of a given path set.
2. **Validation of Acyclicity Assumptions**: We validate the acyclicity assumptions from [14] using a reliable data set. We report on several techniques employed to obtain this data set. The graph derived from the reliable data set, when only considering customer-to-provider relationships, is acyclic. Including peer-to-peer relationships is more problematic, indicating a need for a better understanding of how these relationships affect the graph-theoretical structure of BGP routes and the AS graph.
3. **Comparison of Inference Quality**: We compare the inference quality of our heuristic to a set of standard algorithms from the literature. On the reliable data set, our heuristic produces the lowest number of misclassified customer-to-provider edges among all algorithms tested (approximately 0.3% of all edges in the set are misclassified). We also test the dependence of inference quality on initial pre-knowledge and observe that for our approach, the relative number of misclassified customer-to-provider edges is nearly independent of the amount of pre-knowledge. This indicates that even a small amount of correct relationships is sufficient to infer a high-quality classification among the ASes.

Overall, our findings indicate that the proposed method is a feasible and flexible heuristic with excellent inference quality, particularly for customer-to-provider relationships, and that acyclicity should be an integral part of any further accuracy improvements.

## Related Work
Several algorithms have been proposed to infer relationship types from AS paths. The first attempt was made in [8], where the valley-free path model was introduced, and a heuristic was designed based on statistical properties of a given path set. This approach was extended in [19, 23] to combine valley-free path labelings from different observation points and sources other than AS paths. In [4] (and some precursor papers), a combinatorial approach was developed based on expressing valley-freeness of paths in terms of the 2SAT problem. A combination of the 2SAT-based formulation of valley-freeness and the statistical properties of path sets in terms of mathematical programming was proposed in [7, 6]. The acyclicity approach to interrelationship analysis was introduced in [14]. Computational techniques not based on AS path interpretation have been proposed and discussed in, e.g., [18, 23, 5, 6].

## Preliminaries
We briefly describe a simple, abstract model of inter-domain routing in the Internet using BGP (see, e.g., [22, 16, 9, 8]).

### The Selective Export Rule
The elementary entities in our Internet world are IP addresses, i.e., bit strings of prescribed length. An autonomous system (AS) is a connected group of one or more IP prefixes (i.e., blocks of contiguous IP addresses) run by one or more network operators with a single, clearly defined routing policy [10]. An AS aims to provide global reachability for its IP addresses. To achieve this, ASes with common physical connections exchange routing information according to their local routing policies. BGP is the de facto standard protocol for managing data traffic between ASes for inter-domain routing and route propagation.

Reachability in the Internet depends on physical connectivity and the contractual relationships between ASes. The most fundamental binary business relationships are customer-to-provider (where the provider sells routes to the customer), peer-to-peer (where the involved ASes provide special routes to their customers but no transit for each other), and sibling-to-sibling (where both ASes belong to the same administrative domain). Sibling-to-sibling relations are transitive. More specific relationships appear in the real world (see, e.g., [8]), but we restrict ourselves to the three mentioned types.

Let \( V \) be a set of AS numbers. The undirected graph \( G = (V, E) \) where \( E \) corresponds to physical connections between ASes is called a connectivity graph at the AS level or simply AS graph. For any AS \( v \in V \), denote the set of all siblings of \( v \) (including \( v \) itself) as \( \text{Sibl}(v) \), and \( R(v) \) the set of all currently active AS paths in the BGP routing table of \( v \), i.e., all AS paths that have been announced from neighboring ASes at a certain time and never been withdrawn. Assuming no BGP misconfigurations, all AS paths in \( R(v) \) are loopless and do not include \( v \). Here, an AS path is loopless if, between two sibling ASes on the path, no non-sibling AS is passed. Based on the neighborhood classification, we further divide \( R(v) \) into four categories. A loopless AS path \( (u_1, \ldots, u_r) \in R(v) \) is:
- A customer route of \( v \) if the leftmost \( u_i \notin \text{Sibl}(v) \) is a customer of \( v \).
- A provider route of \( v \) if the leftmost \( u_i \notin \text{Sibl}(v) \) is a provider of \( v \).
- A peer route of \( v \) if the leftmost \( u_i \notin \text{Sibl}(v) \) is a peering partner of \( v \).
- An own route of \( v \) if for all \( 1 \leq i \leq r \), \( u_i \in \text{Sibl}(v) \).

Typically, ASes set up their export policies according to the Selective Export Rule [1, 12, 8], as described in Figure 1. In our simplified model, the receiving AS gets from an AS those routes destined for it.
