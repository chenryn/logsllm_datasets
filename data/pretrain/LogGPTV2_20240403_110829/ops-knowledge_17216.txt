User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Reduce SNMPd logging verbosity SNMPd on my CentOS systems is sending log messages to syslog every time it receives a query from my monitoring tools. Is there a way to lower the verbosity of SNMPd? It adds a lot of clutter to the logs.

Sep 12 13:05:40 myhost snmpd[7073]: Received SNMP packet(s) from UDP: [ipaddr]:42874

Thanks!

Assistant: Check the command that starts snmpd (possibly somewhere /etc/rc.d/ - in Ubuntu it's /etc/defaults/snmpd) for the logging options:

SNMPDOPTS='-Lsd -Lf /dev/null -u snmp -I -smux -p /var/run/snmpd.pid -g root 0.0.0.0'


Or find it in the ps aux | grep snmpd output.

The man page gives the logging options:


  -Ls FACILITY
  
  Log messages via syslog, using the specified facility ('d' for LOG_DAEMON, 'u' for LOG_USER, or '0'-'7' for LOG_LOCAL0 through LOG_LOCAL7). 
  There are also "upper case" versions of each of these options, which allow the corresponding logging mechanism to be restricted to certain priorities of message.
  
  For -LF and -LS the priority specification comes before the file or facility token. The priorities recognised are:


0 or ! for LOG_EMERG,
1 or a for LOG_ALERT,
2 or c for LOG_CRIT,
3 or e for LOG_ERR,
4 or w for LOG_WARNING,
5 or n for LOG_NOTICE,
6 or i for LOG_INFO, and
7 or d for LOG_DEBUG. 


The default is fairly verbose (only 2 levels below debug):


  Normal output is (or will be!) logged at a priority level of LOG_NOTICE 


If you're logging to syslog via LOG_DAEMON (-Lsd), you could reduce it to e.g. LOG_WARNING with -LSwd/-LS4d, or LOG_ERR with -LSed/-LS3d.

(Edited to put the options in the right order.)
