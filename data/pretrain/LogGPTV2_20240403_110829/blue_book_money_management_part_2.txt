    * `Assets:Savings:CashFlowRefiller`: Here I store the average monthly
        expenses for the following two months.
    * `Assets:Savings:UnexpectedExpenses`: Deposit for unexpected expenses such
        as car or domestic appliances repairs.
    * `Assets:Savings:Home`: Deposit for the initial payment or a house.
### Debts
Debts can be tracked either as an asset or as a liability. If you expect them to
owe you more often (you lend a friend some money), model it as an asset, if
you're going to owe them (you borrow from the bank to buy a house), model it as
a liability.

* `Equity:Errors`: Used with the `pad` statements to track the errors in the
    accounting.
* `Equity:Forgiven`: Used in the transactions to forgive someone's debts.

### Initialization of accounts
```
# Initialization
2010-05-17 pad Assets:Cash Equity:Opening-Balances
2016-01-01 pad Assets:Debt:Person1 Equity:Opening-Balances
```
### Transfer includes
I reference each year's `year.book` and the `.closed.accounts.book`.
```
# Transfers
include ".closed.accounts.book"
include "2011/year.book"
...
include "2020/year.book"
```
## The monthly book
Each month has a file with this structure:
```beancount
# Cash transfers

```
Where each section stores:
* `Cash transfers`: The transactions done by cash, extracted from the
    Android [`cone`](cone.md) application.
* `CashFlowCard`: Bank account extracts transformed from the csv to postings
    with [`bean-extract`](beancount.md).
* `Savings`: Bank account extracts transformed from the csv to postings
    with [`bean-extract`](beancount.md).
* `Monthly balances`: I try to review the accounts once each month. This section
is subdivided in:
    * `Active accounts`: The accounts whose value changes monthly.
    * `Deposits`: The accounts that don't change much each month.
    * `Debts`: The balance of debt accounts.
    * `Equity`: The `pad` statements to track the errors in the monthly account.
* `Weekly balances`: As doing the monthly review is long, but it doesn't give me
    the enough information to not mess up the cash transactions, I do a weekly
    balance of those accounts.
