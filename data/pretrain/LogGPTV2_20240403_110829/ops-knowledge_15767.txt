User: I am programming python with my Mac laptop, however, the final executable will be run on final users' Windows system. And the Windows system hasn't set up the python environment specifically. 
Can I generate an executable file on my Mac laptop, and Windows user can directly run on Windows system?
I looked at py2exe, but it seems it must build the python on Windows in order to run the exe on Windows.
Assistant: You can not generate Windows executable files on OS X. You must use the platform which you want the program to run on to compile the program. If you own a copy of Windows, you could run a virtual machine on you Mac and compile it on that.
