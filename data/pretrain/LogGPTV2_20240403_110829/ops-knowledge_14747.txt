User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Security implications of using a OAuth-enabled password manager I've resisted the idea of password managers for a long time. Bringing together passwords for all your online accounts in one place that is only protected by difficult-to-remember master password doesn't sound like a good idea to me.

However, I've been doing lots of password resets lately. I try to vary my passwords as is recommended but I always forget them. Doing a password reset takes unnecessary time and it is a pain in the butt. So then I thought... why not try a password manager that uses Google's OAuth service instead of a master password? People who gain access to my Gmail account would be able to log into all these accounts anyway, since they can do a password reset.

Of course there are still other risks associated with such a setup. Malware could steal the database and brute force it. Then again typed passwords could be stolen by a keylogger and session cookies could be intercepted as well. A cloud-based password storage solution may introduce even more additional risks. But on the plus side, if I don't have to remember the password I can use much tougher password strings.

What are your thoughts on this idea? Would it be less safe to store my passwords this way in exchange for increased convenience? Are there existing software products out there that authenticate with OAuth instead of a master password? You may want to consider that I already have two-factor authentication turned on for my Google account. I would only use this tool for services that already send password reset e-mails to this Google account.

Assistant: It certainly is more convenient. But i doubt it would be more secure. 

For one thing, such a setup introduces another point of failure compared to the master password solution. The attack surface would be larger as there would be another target (Google), to compromise instead of just your password manager service. How much more risk this adds depends on how you view Google's security.

Is remembering just ONE highly random password that difficult for you? My online passwords are stored with lastpass. All of them have very random passwords ranging from 18 to 30 characters. I only have to remember ONE 10 character password(which i deem secure enough to withstand bruteforce attacks).

You still have to remember the password of your gmail account, which SHOULD be just as long and random as any password you would consider for your master password. So i don't see any benefits to your scheme at all.
