### Summary of the New Feature/Enhancement

**Feature Request: Application Aliases for Quick Launch**

We propose adding the ability to set custom aliases for applications, allowing users to launch them with short, memorable commands. For example, a user could launch Visual Studio Code by typing `vscode` or open Windows Terminal by simply typing `t` and pressing Enter.

**Use Case:**
This feature would be particularly useful for users who have many unrelated files on their disk, making it difficult to quickly locate and open specific applications. The following screenshot illustrates a typical scenario where this feature would be beneficial:

By implementing application aliases, we can significantly enhance the user experience by providing a more efficient and intuitive way to launch frequently used applications.
