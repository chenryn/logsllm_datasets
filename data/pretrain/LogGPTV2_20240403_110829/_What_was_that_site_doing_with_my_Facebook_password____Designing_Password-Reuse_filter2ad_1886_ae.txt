Figure 7: Respondents’ perceptions of whether actions would increase security, as well as their stated intention (across con-
ditions) of taking those actions upon receiving the notification. We group actions by whether they relate to password reuse.
any accounts other than AcmeCo. As Figure 5 shows, an additional
15.6 % only intended to do so for accounts where they used exactly
the same password, while 14.1 % only intended to change passwords
for important accounts. The largest portion of respondents would
not change their passwords on other accounts because they did
not perceive connections between the account addressed by the
notification and any other account. R69 explained, “Unless I heard
from a company that was hacked, I’m not concerned.” Furthermore,
respondents believed that if the account providers were unrelated,
then the risks to account security also must be unrelated. A few
respondents speculated that the threats were unrelated because “a
potential hacker likely doesn’t know my additional accounts exist”
(R23). Unfortunately, because reuse of both usernames and pass-
words across services is common [10, 62], attackers know to try
the same or similar credentials across unrelated services.
In contrast, only 15.3 % of respondents reported intending to
change their passwords on all other accounts, while 19.7% reported
intending to change all passwords that were similar to the one
that was compromised. Unfortunately, even for respondents who
said they would intend to change other passwords, their intended
password-creation strategies would leave many at risk. The ma-
jority of respondents again intended to either modify (46.5 %) or
directly reuse (9.6 %) passwords they already used elsewhere, as
shown in Figure 6. On a more positive note, 38.8 % of respondents
reported intending to use a password manager or browser to gen-
erate these other passwords, which balances usability and security
for changing many passwords at once.
7.4 Taking Other Security-Related Actions
For nine additional actions unrelated to password changes, respon-
dents again rated their expectation of how these actions impact
security, as well as their likelihood to take these actions upon re-
ceiving the notification. Notifications should encourage actions
that are both productive and relevant for addressing password reuse.
To account for these nuances, we included four actions that can
potentially address password reuse, as well as five that are only
tangentially related to the situation, as shown in Figure 7.
Notifications encourage 2FA adoption, yet are less effec-
tive at encouraging the use of password managers. The notifi-
cations had a divergent impact on two of the actions most relevant
to mitigating threats from password reuse: enabling 2FA and using
a password manager. While 83.3 % of respondents agreed that en-
abling 2FA would improve their security and 64.0 % rated it likely
that they would do so, only 44.3 % agreed that using a password
manager would improve their security, and only 37.3 % rated it
likely they would adopt one after receiving the notification.
In contrast, 78.8 % of respondents agreed changing their pass-
word more frequently would improve security, and 51.9 % rated it
likely they would do so. Furthermore, 80.9 % of respondents agreed
that reviewing the recent activity on their account would improve
security, and 89.5 % rated it likely they would do so.
Notification variants did not impact the likelihood of tak-
ing these actions. Which notification respondents saw did not
significantly impact their stated likelihood of taking any of these
nine actions. However, some demographic factors did. Respondents
with a background in technology expressed a higher likelihood of
using a password manager (OR = 1.7, p = .002), using an identity
theft protection service (OR = 1.6, p = .008), and changing the
way they lock their phone (OR = 1.4, p = .033) upon receiving
the notification. Finally, female respondents expressed being more
likely to review the activity on their account (OR = 1.5, p = .022).
Notification variants minimally impacted security percep-
tions. Respondents’ agreement that updating their account’s secu-
rity questions would improve security varied across notifications
(regression p = .012), though we did not observe the notification to
significantly impact perceptions of any of the other eight actions.
Compared to respondents who saw model, those who saw model-
{vagueCause} (OR = 2.7, p = .017) or model-{suspicious} (OR = 3.5,
p = .004) were more likely to agree that updating their security
questions would improve security. We observed the same effect
for three notifications that mentioned that AcmeCo itself had been
breached: model-{usBreach}-{mobile} (OR = 3.6, p = .002), model-
-{usBreach}-{inApp} (OR = 2.4, p = .035), and model-{usBreach}-
-{noOthers} (OR = 2.6, p = .026). Female respondents were more
likely to agree that it would improve security (OR = 1.4, p = .047),
while those who had never received a data-breach notification were
less likely to do so (OR = 0.6, p = .009).
Demographic factors were correlated with variations in respon-
dents’ perceptions of how these actions impacted security. Female
respondents were more likely to agree that using an identity theft
protection service (OR = 1.6, p = .003), changing their password
more frequently (OR = 1.7, p = .001), and changing how they
lock their computer (OR = 1.5, p = .011) would improve secu-
rity. Respondents with a background in technology (OR = 0.5,
p < .001) and those who had never received a data-breach noti-
fication (OR = 0.7, p = .015) were also less likely to agree with
this statement. Respondents with a background in technology were
also less likely to agree that changing their password in the future
improves security (OR = 0.7, p = .023), while those who had never
received a data-breach notification were less likely to agree that
updating software improves security (OR = 0.7, p = .043).
7.5 Perceptions of the Notification
Most respondents would act in response within 24 hours. We
found that most respondents would anticipate seeing and acting
on the notification within a short period of time, despite our no-
tifications varying in delivery method. 87.4 % reported that they
would see the notification within 24 hours and 84.5 % would intend
to take action within 24 hours; responses did not vary significantly
across notifications. Respondents strongly preferred that account
providers contact them via email (90.0 %), although SMS (43.9 %),
mobile app (32.5 %), and mobile push notification (29.1 %) were also
favorable options. Interestingly, this stated preference for email
notifications conflicts with some respondents’ hesitation to take
action because of phishing concerns (Section 7.3).
Respondents’ trust was lower when AcmeCo suffered a
breach. We found that the level of reported trust varied signifi-
cantly across notification conditions (regression p = .004). Com-
pared to model, the reported trust of the provider was, perhaps
unsurprisingly, lower for model-{usBreach}-{inApp}, which stated
that AcmeCo itself was breached (OR = 0.3, p = .003). In their
free-response justification, 13.8 % respondents overall reported de-
creased trust because they believed it to be AcmeCo’s responsibility
to prevent such breaches. On the contrary, 8.3 % of respondents’
trust did not change, as “any company is bound to have security
breaches” (R196). However, across conditions, 45.2 % of respondents
increased trust in AcmeCo as a result of the notification, and 35.8 %
reported no change. This was because the notification conveyed a
prioritization of their safety (29.3 %) or proactive and transparent
policies (13.3 %). An additional 15.1 % of respondents believed that
such a notification was simply expected of a company.
Experience with technology and data breaches impacted
perceptions. In our models, we also compared the responses of
respondents who had prior experience with data breaches to those
who had no such experiences. Respondents who had never been
notified about being in a breach reported that receiving the notifi-
cation would lead to greater trust in AcmeCo compared to those
who had previously received a data-breach notification (OR = 1.7
p = .002). Respondents who had never received such a notification
were also more likely to agree that they would not know why they
received such a notification (OR = 1.6, p = .002), more likely to
perceive the notification as official (OR = 1.6, p = .009), and less
likely to expect companies to send notifications like the one they
saw (OR = 0.7, p = .043). This may be because prior experience
gives respondents some expectations of provider behavior.
Respondents who reported a background in technology were
more likely to agree that they would not know why they received
such a notification (OR = 1.6, p = .008) and more likely to agree that
ignoring the notification would have no consequences (OR = 1.6,
p = .006). They were also less likely to agree that they expected
companies to send such notifications (OR = 0.6, p = .010), less
likely to agree that they would believe such a notification was
official (OR = 0.5, p < .001), and less likely to prioritize taking
action in response (OR = 0.7, p = .031). They were also less likely
to agree that the notification explained how to resolve the situation
(OR = 0.6, p = .007) and less likely to report that they would feel
grateful about receiving the notification (OR = 0.6, p < .001).
8 LIMITATIONS
Like many survey studies, our results suffer from self-report biases.
Respondents may have answered questions according to social
desirability: selecting the answer they believe they should select,
rather than their true answer [35]. To mitigate this bias, we did not
explain that this was a study about security, and we included soft-
ening language in sensitive questions to remind respondents that
people may have many different responses. That said, stated inten-
tions are typically an upper bound on actual behavior [58]. As many
respondents’ intended actions would still leave them vulnerable to
further attacks, reality may be even worse. This would be consis-
tent with other researchers’ finding that LinkedIn’s actual breach
notification was ineffective at prompting password resets [29].
Finally, we report on a convenience sample of MTurk workers
receiving our hypothetical notifications. Such a design is inher-
ently limited in its ecological validity. However, given that such
notifications have rarely been studied, testing notifications for the
first time in the field and potentially causing respondents to think
they had been breached would create too high of a potential risk
to human subjects. As in prior work on other types of notification
messages [15], we chose to conduct a formative, controlled study
to inform future research on password-reuse notifications.

Notifications are identified by their sender (and additional
details if we collected multiple from the same provider).
