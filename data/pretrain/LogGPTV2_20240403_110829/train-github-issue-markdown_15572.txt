Currently, we generate a large number of base images for the GCE VMs used in node end-to-end (e2e) testing. These images are duplicated across two different GCE projects to support our Continuous Integration (CI) processes.

To improve this, we can modify the node e2e framework to launch VMs from non-local GCE projects. This approach would eliminate the need for image duplication and also enable the community to contribute images that can be integrated into the node e2e CI process.
