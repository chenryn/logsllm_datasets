As of now we create a lot of base images for the GCE VMs that we spin up for
node e2e. These images are duplicated in two different GCE projects for the
purposes of CI.
Instead, we can have the node e2e framework spin up VMs from non-local
projects. That way, we can avoid duplication and also let the community
contribute images that needs to be included in the node e2e CI.
