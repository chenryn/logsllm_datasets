various industrial applications, e.g., tracking carts and machines.
Packet loss: Ideally, uniformly sampled CSI offers the best per-
formance of RIM. In practice, RIM can tolerate packet loss to a
certain extent by interpolation. However, a relatively clean channel
is needed to ensure delightful performance.

Angle resolution: Currently, RIM only exploits discrete directions
defined by the antenna array (e.g., 30◦ resolution with a 6-antenna
uniform circular array). Noticing that the TRRS decreases differently
with respect to different deviation angles, we believe it is promising
to investigate finer-granularity directions in continuous space by
leveraging the geometric relationship of adjacent antenna pairs.
Limitation of rotating angle: The current prototype of RIM can
only sense in-place rotation with coarse resolution, and is not able to
monitor the rotating angle of swinging turns (i.e., move while turn).
It remains open to exploring more general and accurate angular
motion measurement based on RIM. Furthermore, although we have
demonstrated the ability to track movements during turnings in
§6.3.3 by integrating inertial sensors, it is interesting to investigate
simultaneous translational and rotational motions using RIM only.
3D motion: While RIM achieves better precision and robustness, it
cannot measure 3D motion like traditional inertial sensors. Building
a specialized 3D array will immediately break the limitation, which
may be impractical in some scenarios but still valuable for special-
purpose applications like drone tracking. Incorporating existing
techniques such as WiBall [46], which is based on TRRS as well,
may offer (less accurate) distance estimation in arbitrary directions,
without the need of a 3D array. The 3D direction, however, remains
open for future research.
Fusing inertial sensors: RIM promotes inertial measurements
especially for distance and heading estimation, which traditional in-
ertial sensors can hardly measure. Nevertheless, gyroscope provides
a reasonably high accuracy of rotating angles while magnetome-
ter reports absolute orientation. Considering that inertial sensors
almost always present alongside with WiFi radios, we keep it as a
promising direction to fuse them together, both by applying RIM
to calibrate inertial sensors and by incorporating inertial sensors
with RIM, which would boost ubiquitous inertial measurements for
many applications such as indoor tracking and virtual reality.
8 RELATED WORKS
Related works fall in two areas.
Wireless tracking and sensing: Numerous efforts have been de-
voted to wireless tracking and sensing during the past decades.
Many existing works employ different channel parameters for track-
ing, such as Angle of Arrival (AoA) [13, 15, 43], Time of Flight (ToF)
[9, 29], or their fusion [26, 41]. The latest of them [14] pushes the
accuracy to sub-centimeter level. These approaches, however, usu-
ally require a large phased array or a large frequency bandwidth,
typically together with clear LOS condition, to achieve good perfor-
mance. Efforts have been made to expand bandwidth by frequency
hopping [35, 40] and extend antenna array [42], which however
incur extra spectrum or hardware overhead. In addition, the exist-
ing works require cooperation across multiple APs (four or five)
[13, 15, 43]. A few prior proposals attempt to track using a single
AP, which again, still need precise AP location and orientation
[29, 35], or achieves decimeter accuracy [46]. Moreover, many of
the existing works degrade or fail in NLOS conditions. In contrast,
RIM is truly multipath-resilient. It has centimeter motion tracking
even in complex NLOS scenarios, and resolves direction simultane-
ously, using only a single arbitrarily placed AP without knowing
any of its information.
Other works leverage fingerprinting of dense APs [1, 27, 30]. [25]
employs CIR for movement detection, but does not address motion
tracking. Centimeter granularity fingerprinting is studied using
CIR [39], which is further enhanced by multiple antennas [5] and
by frequency hopping [4]. [37] leverages multipath profiles of RFID
channel parameters for fine-grained fingerprinting. These proposals
require exhaustive calibration prior to deployment and deteriorate
due to temporal dynamics. Differently, RIM does not need any
calibration. [38] tracks orientation with an array of RFID tags, which
relies on precise phase difference of arrival only available on RFID
and does not address moving distance. [31] utilizes phase profiles
to determine the relative order of RFID tags, yet does not solve the
relative distances nor directions. The emerging 802.11mc [11] and
Bluetooth 5.1 [34] standards provide Round Trip Time and AoA
measurement respectively. Both of them, however, offer limited
accuracy, especially in indoor environments.
Inertial sensing: Inertial sensing and its applications have been
widely studied in aerodynamics, robotics, and mobile computing
[6, 19, 28, 32, 44]. To reduce measurement errors, various algorithms
have been proposed for efficient sensor fusion among accelerometer,
gyroscope, and magnetometer [2, 22]. Regarding inertial sensing
on mobile and wearable devices, the state-of-the-art orientation is
probably achieved by A3 [47] and MUSE [33]. Compared to orienta-
tion, tracking moving distance with inertial sensors is a much more
challenging task. Prior works only track coarse-grained inertial
distance for short-time motion, by counting steps and estimating
step lengths [36, 44]. Low-cost inertial sensors however, are hardly
able to track precise distance [12], for which RIM offers a superior
complement. Inertial sensors have also been employed for activity
recognition and classification, which we envision RIM will enable
better. We note that RIM is particularly complementary to conven-
tional inertial sensors and we envision the comprehensive fusion
of them in the future.
Many other modalities can also track the location of objects,
including computer vision [7, 24], visible light [16, 20], acoustic
sensing [21, 45], etc. These technologies usually require special in-
frastructure or are vulnerable to dynamic ambient contexts, making
them less favorable for ubiquitous motion measurements. They do
not resolve multiple inertial parameters either.
9 CONCLUSION
This paper presents RIM, a precise inertial measurement system
that estimates centimeter-level moving distance, heading direction,
and rotating angle using commercial WiFi radios. It works over a
large multipath rich area wherever is covered by a single unknown
AP that is arbitrarily placed, without the support of additional in-
frastructure or sensors. By doing so, RIM opens up WiFi-based
motion sensing to new applications demanding accurate and reli-
able motion measurements, such as robot monitoring, VR tracking,
mobile gaming, etc. This work does not raise any ethical issues.
