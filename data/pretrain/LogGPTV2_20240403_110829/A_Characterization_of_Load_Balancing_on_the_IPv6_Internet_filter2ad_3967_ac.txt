of diamond length, with 93% of diamonds of length 5 or less.
Diamond asymmetry. Figure 6 shows the distribution of diamond asymmetry
in our dataset. Linode has asymmetric diamonds in its network that show up
on many routes (solid blue line). If we ignore load balancers one or two hops
upstream of the vantage point (dashed lines), these diamonds are not consid-
ered and we observe that 96% of diamonds are symmetric. The few asymmet-
ric diamonds usually have asymmetry less than or equal to 2. We ﬁnd that
71% of asymmetric diamonds are instances of inter-domain load balancing, i.e.,
when the diamond starts and ends in diﬀerent ASes.6 This illustrates that more
complex inter-domain traﬃc engineering leads to more complex load balancing
6 This can happen as a result of traﬃc engineering or, for example, when a BGP router
with ECMP enabled receives and installs multiple routes to a preﬁx (e.g., at an IXP)
or when multiple BGP routers redistribute diﬀerent routes to the same preﬁx into
an IGP (e.g., OSPF) with ECMP enabled.

conﬁgurations. Conversely, only 26% of symmetric load balancers are instances
of inter-domain load balancing. Diﬀerent inter-domain routes might have diﬀer-
ent performance, fortunately, we ﬁnd that 70% of asymmetric diamonds start at
per-destination load balancers, which will send all packets from the same source
and destination pair on the same inter-domain route.
Diamond max-width. Figure 7 shows the distribution of max-width for all
diamonds in our dataset. By deﬁnition, the minimum max-width for a diamond
is 2. We ﬁnd most diamonds are narrow, in particular around 81% of diamonds
across both platforms have max-width equal or less than 5. By varying the last
8 bits of the destination address, probe packets will follow the same route since
IPv6 preﬁxes in global routing tables are usually shorter than /48 [2]. However,
when reaching the destination network, packets may be directed to diﬀerent
hosts whose addresses share a /116 preﬁx with the destination. (We found this
to be common in Microsoft’s datacenters.) Figure 7 includes these measurements
as diamonds with very large max-width, and shows that such errors are rare and
do not impact the overall ﬁndings.
Diamond min-width. Figure 8 shows the distribution of min-width over all
diamonds in our dataset. By deﬁnition, the minimum min-width is 2 and is
bounded by the max-width. We ﬁnd most diamonds have a min-width of 2.
Comparison to IPv4 diamonds. Our ﬁndings for diamond lengths, asym-
metry, max-widths, and min-widths are similar but not quantitatively close to
ﬁndings on IPv4 load balancers by Augustin et al. [1]. For example, they found
that load balancers are often short and narrow, and reported that 55% of routes
with load balancing traverse a diamond of length 2 and max-width less than
or equal to 3; in our dataset, we ﬁnd 24% diamonds of this kind. Augustin et
al. also found that long and wide diamonds are rare; in our dataset, only 14% of
diamonds have both length and max-width larger than 3. Similar to our results,
Augustin et al. also found that most IPv4 load balancers are symmetric.

5.4 Confounding Factors
Routers may override the traﬃc class or ﬂow label ﬁelds for traﬃc engineering or
other reasons. Such routers may interfere with our identiﬁcation of load balancers
by modifying a probe’s traﬃc class or ﬂow label ﬁelds with a variable value when
we try to keep the values ﬁxed, and by overwriting ﬁelds with a ﬁxed value when
we try to vary them.
ICMPv6 time-exceeded messages encapsulate the header of the expired TTL-
limited probe. We use the encapsulated header to identify the values of the traﬃc
class and ﬂow label ﬁelds on all probes received by each router in a route. If we
identify a router that received a probe with a traﬃc class or ﬂow label ﬁeld diﬀerent
from the expected value we infer that the previous router has overwritten it. If the
ﬁeld is overwritten, we identify whether it is overwritten with a ﬁxed or variable
value. Note that the ‘expected’ values for the traﬃc class and ﬂow label ﬁelds
change along the route as routers overwrite them. We identify router behavior
proceeding hop-by-hop starting from the vantage point.

We ﬁnd that a small (but not negligible) portion of the routers overwrite the
traﬃc class ﬁeld. Table 3 summarizes router behavior. The few routers (0.7%) that
overwrite the traﬃc class ﬁeld with a variable value might lead to the (incorrect)
identiﬁcation of per-packet load balancers. Routers that overwrite the traﬃc class
ﬁeld with a ﬁxed value do not impact the identiﬁcation of load balancing, but
252
R. Almeida et al.
prevent us from identifying whether routers use the traﬃc class ﬁeld for load
balancing (leading to underestimation of ‘per-ﬂow with TC’ in Table 2).
In general, traceroute measurements are challenged by factors such as tun-
neling and router behavior [14] as well as routers that do not respond to TTL-
expired probes or ﬁrewalls that drop measurement probes [13]. As a result of
these factors, we might underestimate the amount of load balancing.
6 Related Work
Load balancing and its impact. The impact of load balancing on IPv4 tracer-
oute measurements was ﬁrst reported on by Augustin et al. in 2006 (see [1]). Since
then, MDA has been proposed to bound load balancer identiﬁcation errors [16]
and an extensive characterization of IPv4 load balancing was published [1].
Paris traceroute was the ﬁrst, but today most traceroute tools and measurement
platforms keep ﬂow identiﬁers ﬁxed to avoid load balancing. Besides impact-
ing traceroute measurements, load balancing has also been reported to impact
latency measurements [15] and observed routing dynamics [6].
IPv6 measurement tools and characterization studies. As far as we are
aware, Scamper [11] is the only other implementation of MDA that supports
IPv6. Also, we are not aware of any other characterization of IPv6 load balancers.
Other work have developed techniques to measure IPv6 routers, including IPv6
alias resolution [3,12] and router availability [4]; while others have quantiﬁed
IPv6 deployment and performance [7,8].
7 Conclusions and Future Work
We implemented an IPv6 version of the MDA to identify routers that perform
load balancing and classify their behavior. We collected measurements from 12
nodes in 7 countries to 51927 destinations. We ﬁnd that IPv6 load balancing
shares many similarities with IPv4 load balancing, with a few diﬀerences. First,
although IPv6 load balancing is widespread, it is less so than IPv4 load bal-
ancing. Second, IPv6 routes have signiﬁcantly higher probability of traversing
per-packet load balancers than IPv4 routes, which may negatively impact TCP
performance. Although we cannot explain the causes behind the higher preva-
lence of per-packet load balancers, this is partially explained by routers that
overwrite the traﬃc class ﬁeld in IPv6 headers with variable values. Other pos-
sible explanations include less mature IPv6 load balancing implementations or
less established best practices when compared to IPv4.
The prevalence of per-packet load balancers we observe motivate investiga-
tion of the impact of IPv6 load balancing on IPv6 traﬃc. As future work, we plan
to correlate performance metrics with load balancing behavior. We also plan to
extend our MDA implementation to allow more ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation of load
balancers. In particular, we plan to add support for IPv6 extension headers and
to allow measurements varying a combination of ﬁelds in probe headers.
