Subject: Issue with Django Backend After Upgrading GAE SDK

Dear Support Team,

I recently upgraded my Google App Engine (GAE) SDK from version 1.4 to 1.7 on my local Ubuntu system, and I have encountered an issue that I am unable to resolve. 

Initially, the only warning I received was a message stating, "You are using the old GAE SDK 1.4." To address this, I uninstalled the old version of GAE and installed GAE 1.7. Additionally, I replaced the `djangoappengine` folder with the latest version. The new GAE installation was copied to the `/usr/local` directory, as my `~/.bashrc` file's PATH variable points to this location.

However, after the upgrade, I am now encountering the following error:

```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: 'djangoappengine.db' isn't an available database backend.
Try using django.db.backends.XXX, where XXX is one of:
'dummy', 'mysql', 'oracle', 'postgresql', 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'sqlite3'
Error was: No module named utils
```

Since the application was running smoothly before the upgrade, I do not believe the issue is related to the directory structure.

Could you please provide some guidance on how to resolve this issue? Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Sunil

Hi Sunil,

It sounds like the issue might be related to the compatibility between your updated `djangoappengine` and the other components in your `django-nonrel` setup. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:

1. **Update `django-nonrel` and `djangotoolbox`:** Ensure that both `django-nonrel` and `djangotoolbox` are up-to-date and compatible with the version of `djangoappengine` you are using. You can update them using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade django-nonrel djangotoolbox
   ```

2. **Check Your `settings.py`:** Verify that your `settings.py` file is correctly configured for the new `djangoappengine` version. Specifically, ensure that the database backend is set correctly. It should look something like this:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'djangoappengine.db',
           'NAME': 'your-database-name',
           'USER': '',
           'PASSWORD': '',
           'HOST': '',
           'PORT': '',
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify `utils` Module:** The error message indicates that the `utils` module is missing. Make sure that all required modules are present and correctly installed. You can check the `djangoappengine` package to ensure it includes the necessary `utils` module.

4. **Reinstall `djangoappengine`:** If the above steps do not resolve the issue, try completely removing and reinstalling `djangoappengine`:
   ```sh
   pip uninstall djangoappengine
   pip install djangoappengine
   ```

If you continue to experience issues, please provide more details about your current setup, including the versions of `django`, `django-nonrel`, and `djangotoolbox`. This information will help in diagnosing the problem further.
