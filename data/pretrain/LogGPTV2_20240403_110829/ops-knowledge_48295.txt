User: What is the easiest way to ping/notify a .NET Windows Service? Do I have to use WCF for this? Or is there an easier way?
I would like to be able to wake up the service using a Python (or an Iron Python) script from anywhere.
Also is there a way I can be notified (by email) if that the service has stopped?
Assistant: I had to host a WCF in the windows service to allow it to be notified remotely. Just to keep deploying the solution as simple as possible. using the ServiceController would require the correct setup of permissions
