### Bug report
**Bug summary**
  * A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug
I receive a UTF-8 error when importing matplotlib == 1.5.1 when installed
either from conda or pip. I am using OSX 10.11.6 and Python 3.5.2. This laptop
has Spanish locale support but this was done entirely within the US locale
setting. There is no matplotlibrc file that I am aware of.
**Code for reproduction**
    $ conda install matplotlib
    $ python
    > import matplotlib
  * A minimum code snippet required to reproduce the bug, also minimizing the number of dependencies required
    $ conda install matplotlib
    $ python
    > import matplotlib# Paste your code here
**Actual outcome**
  * The output produced by the above code, which may be a screenshot, console output, etc.
