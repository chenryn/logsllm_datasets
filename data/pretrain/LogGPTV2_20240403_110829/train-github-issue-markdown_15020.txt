Hi everyone,  
I was facing "init dgesdd failed init" error when I tried to estimate a huge
matrix (>=10k) with tick.hawkesADM4, since my data is large, I need to
estimate for the matrix with size around 200k. But when I tried with only 10k
on the linux with huge (around 50GB) , It always pop up an error of failed
init.
Can anyone help me please?  
Thank you.
