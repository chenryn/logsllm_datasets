**Abstract:**
Audit logs are essential for tracking the current state of systems and user activities, serving as a critical resource for cyber forensics and maintenance. They are the primary source for identifying malicious activities or troubleshooting system failures. Effective management and archiving of audit logs are crucial for ensuring the availability and performance of computing resources and for meaningful forensic audits. However, these logs are vulnerable to multidimensional threats, and superusers or system administrators can alter them. Repudiation is a significant issue in computer forensics, which can be mitigated by secure event log recording. Common practices include periodic backups, encrypted data transfer, off-site storage, and certificate-based storage. This survey examines the requirements and approaches for securing audit logs, develops a taxonomy of audit log management, compares existing methods, and highlights current challenges and available solutions.

### 1. Introduction

Information systems consist of various interconnected devices, such as servers, client terminals, switches, routers, firewalls, storage area networks (SANs), network-attached storage (NAS), and other smart devices. These components generate log files that record their progress and profiles. The structure of these logs varies depending on the device, and well-known standards for remote log management include Syslog, RSyslog, and syslog-ng. Operating systems like Windows and Linux also generate multiple types of logs.

The Internet of Things (IoT) exemplifies this interconnectedness, with Cisco predicting 50 billion connected devices by 2020. IoT has transformed many fields, including healthcare, automobiles, entertainment, industrial appliances, sports, and homes, enhancing daily life and interactions. However, this connectivity raises concerns about security, privacy, and trust.

Cloud-based applications, such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS), have further expanded the digital landscape. These systems, composed of multiple interconnected devices, are managed through emerging technologies like Fog Computing. In fog computing, smart devices (Edge Nodes) connect to the cloud via gateways, which act as micro data centers (MDCs). This localized behavior improves the availability and performance of cloud services.

Trust is crucial for the utility and reliability of computing services. Verifiable and trustworthy systems depend on monitoring features provided by service providers. Secure and verifiable logs are essential for establishing trust, as they help detect malicious activities and support forensic investigations. Unfortunately, insiders often have unprecedented access to these logs, making them vulnerable to multidimensional threats, including privacy breaches, insider threats, and data alteration or deletion.

### 1.1. Security Parameters

The basic building blocks of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability, forming the CIA triad. Additional elements include authentication, non-repudiation, and privacy. These measures contribute to building user trust. Event logs are vital for ensuring these security parameters. Secure log management practices are essential for a robust computing environment.

### 1.2. Logging Modes

Logging involves recording events during system execution along with metadata. This process requires additional processing and storage. It is crucial to detect system failures and vulnerabilities. Two main logging modes are Circular Logging and Linear Logging. Circular logging reuses storage without special maintenance but may not retain logs for long periods. Linear logging stores logs for longer durations but requires human intervention to manage the queue and free space.

### 1.3. Logs Storage Scenarios

Logs must be stored efficiently. Decentralized, centralized, and distributed logging are common methods. Decentralized logging stores logs on local computers/edge nodes, requiring physical visits for maintenance. Centralized logging captures all events at a central location, simplifying monitoring but posing risks if the central server fails. Distributed logging uses multiple logging servers, ensuring data consistency and availability.

Logs can be stored in various formats, including CSV files, plain text files, relational databases (RDBMS), and graph databases, which offer dynamic data handling.

### 1.4. Why Secure Audit Logs?

Non-repudiation ensures that an actor cannot deny their activity. In computer forensics, secure event recording is essential to prevent malicious actors from denying their actions. Audit logs are the only source of activity records in a computing environment. If these logs are not secure, evidence of malicious activities can be destroyed.

In addition to basic security requirements (confidentiality, integrity, availability, non-repudiation, and privacy), extended security requirements include correctness, integrity with forwarding security, immutability, insider threat mitigation, and statistics sharing. Correctness ensures the authenticity of information, while integrity with forwarding security protects logs even if the system is compromised. Immutability ensures data consistency, and insider threat mitigation addresses the risk of malicious insiders. Verifiability allows logs to be verified by other resources.

Common attacks on logging schemes include:
- **Withhold Attack:** Temporarily holding logs to block certain messages.
- **Modification Attack:** Altering log entries before storage.
- **Insertion Attack:** Creating fake messages to gain unauthorized access.

Understanding these threats and vulnerabilities is crucial for developing effective log management and security strategies.
