Ωi = γi−1xri = γi−1λi,
which agrees with previous results [3], [13].
2.3 Properties of Fluid Response Curves
Theorem 1 leads to several important properties of the ﬂuid
response curve F, which we discuss next. These properties
tell us how bandwidth information can be extracted from
the curve F, and also show the deviation of F, as one
should be aware of, from the single-hop ﬂuid curve S of
the tight link.
Property 1 The output dispersion γN (gI , s) is a continu-
ous piece-wise linear function of the input dispersion gI in
the input dispersion range (0, ∞).
Let 0 = αK+1

0  0, the δ-interval trafﬁc intensity process
{Yi,δ(fj, t)} is a mean-square ergodic process with time-
invariant distribution and ensemble mean xj.
We explain this assumption in more details. First, the
stationary increment assumption implies that the incre-
ment process of {Vi(fj, t)} for any given time interval δ,
namely {Vi(fj, t + δ) − Vi(fj, t) = δYi,δ(fj, t)}, has a
time-invariant distribution. This further implies that the
δ-interval trafﬁc intensity process {Yi,δ(fj, t)} is identi-
cally distributed, whose marginal distribution at any time
instance t can be described by the same random variable
Yi,δ(fj). Second, the mean-square ergodicity implies that,
as the observation interval δ increases, the random variable
Yi,δ(fj) converges to xj in the mean-square sense. In other
words, the variance of Yi,δ(fj) decays to 0 as δ → ∞, i.e.,
E(cid:20)(cid:16)Yi,δ(fj) − xj(cid:17)2(cid:21) = 0.

Assumption 2 For any two ﬂows j and l that enter the
path at link Li, the two processes {Vi(fj, t)} and {Vi(fl, t)}
are independent. Speciﬁcally, for any two time instances t1
and t2, the two random variables Vi(fj, t1) and Vi(fl, t2)
are independent.
As a consequence of the two assumptions we made, the
ergodic stationary property also holds for any ﬂow aggre-
gations at their entering link.
Corollary 1 For any ﬂow aggregation p that enters the
path at link Li, i.e., p (cid:12) ei = p, the process {Vi(p, t)}
has ergodic stationary increments. Consequently, the traf-
ﬁc intensity random variable Yi,δ(p) converges to xp in
the mean-square sense
E(cid:20)(cid:16)Yi,δ(p) − xp(cid:17)2(cid:21) = 0.

[19],
Due to Szczotka [18],
the workload process
{Wi(p, t)} will “inherit” the ergodic stationarity property
from the trafﬁc arrival process {Vi(p, t)}. This property
is further carried over to the δ-interval workload-difference
