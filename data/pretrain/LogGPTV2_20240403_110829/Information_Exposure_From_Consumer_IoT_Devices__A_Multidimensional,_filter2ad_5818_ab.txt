gateway server is automatically captured using tcpdump, using
different files for each MAC address to separate traffic from different
devices. We specify labels (stored in additional pcap files) to isolate
the traffic produced during specific interactions with the device
(e.g., “turn on the smart light”). Our testbed supports labels that
are manually or automatically added, depending on whether the
corresponding experiment is manual or automated.

manual and automated interactions. For IoT devices that require a
companion app, we use Nexus 5X smartphones running Android
6.0.1. Similarly, for IoT devices that require a voice assistant, we
use the Echo Spot (powered by Alexa).
A key enabling factor for the large scale of our measurement
experiments is automation. We automate IoT device interactions
via their apps using the Monkey Application Exerciser included in
Android Studio. For interactions via voice assistants (e.g., Alexa,
Cortana), we need a way to produce speech using the same com-
mand words and same voice across both labs. For this, we use the
cloud-based Google voice synthesizer to generate voice commands
based on text specified in automated experiments, and play those
commands over a loudspeaker located near a voice assistant device
(e.g., Echo Spot).
3.3 Experiments
We conduct controlled, idle, and uncontrolled experiments to ana-
lyze the information exposed by devices under different conditions.
The controlled (power, interaction) and the idle experiments were
performed both in the US and the UK testbed during April 2019,
with device firmware and companion apps updated to the latest
version. All the controlled and idle experiments were repeated over
the VPN tunnel, thus giving UK connectivity to the US-based IoT
devices, and US connectivity to the UK IoT devices. User accounts
for all UK and US devices were created in the same country as
the lab in which they were deployed. In total we performed 34,586
controlled experiments (20,777 using the US testbed, and 13,809
using the UK testbed), plus 112 hours of idle experiments.
During our preliminary study we found

that most IoT devices exchange a considerable amount of traffic
when they are powered on. Thus, our power experiments consist
of powering on the device (previously disconnected from the AC
power) and collecting network traffic for two minutes without
any interaction. We manually repeat these experiments at least
three times for each device. In total we have performed 487 power
experiments across both labs.
To understand the information ex-

posed while interacting with a device, we conduct interaction exper-
iments. These consist of actively interacting with IoT devices and
then labeling the captured traffic with the interaction name. For
each of these experiments we first wait for the device to be powered
on for at least two minutes (to avoid including power experiments
traffic). After two minutes, and right before the interaction starts,
we begin capturing the traffic and continue to do so for the entire
duration of the interaction (the exact amount of time depends on
the device and the interaction method, i.e., the duration of a phys-
ical/app/voice interaction), plus at least additional 5-15 seconds
after the interaction has completed.
The type of interactions we consider for these experiments are
the following: (i) local action, which consists of physically inter-
acting with the device, or using voice commands (without using a
voice assistant from a separate device). (ii) LAN app action, by using
a companion app on a phone connected to the same network as the
IoT device, thus allowing direct communication between the phone
and the IoT device; (iii) cloud app action, by using a companion app
on a phone connected to a different network than the IoT device, to
force the IoT device to use cloud infrastructure to communicate;
(iv) voice command action, by using voice commands to trigger the

Echo Spot’s Alexa voice assistant, which subsequently interacted
with the device according to the voice command.
The majority of interaction experiments that involve the use of
a companion app or a voice command have been automated and
repeated at least 30 times, resulting in a total of 32,030 automated
interaction experiments across both labs. Experiments that involve
physical interactions or whose interactions cannot be automated
safely or reliably (e.g., devices in the appliances category having a
heating element) have been performed manually and repeated at
least three times, resulting in a total of 2,069 manual interaction
experiments across both labs.

might expect that an IoT device would have minimal information
exposure when it is not actively being used. To test whether this
intuition holds, we conduct idle experiments that capture the traffic
of an IoT device when it is not actively used and is located in an
environment isolated from human interaction. Our idle periods
cover an average of 8 hours per night for one week for each lab.
These experiments

consist of capturing all the (unlabeled) traffic generated by the
IoT devices in the US testbed during an IRB-approved user study,
where 36 user study participants are allowed to use the IoT devices
for their intended purpose in a studio apartment setting. These
participants are 5 faculty/postdoc and 31 students at Northeastern
University’s Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute in Boston. Partici-
pants may use the lab at any time (except during the period where
we conducted idle experiments), and they may use any device in the
room as they see fit. Commonly used devices include the refrigera-
tor, laundry machines, and microwave, while the Alexa devices and
motion-triggered devices are also frequently active. Collectively,
we typically see about 20-30 lab accesses per day, with at least
one active device interaction per access. A common interaction
pattern is a person that enters the lab to put their food in the smart
fridge (or to put their laundry in the washer), then they come again
later to reheat it in the smart microwave (or to move their laundry
to the dryer). These common interaction patterns do not trigger
just the devices that the participants are actively using, but also
smart cameras, smart doorbells, smart motion/contact sensor, and
smart lights, which are always active and passively triggered by
the simple presence of the participant.
We use a subset of the user study data collected between Sep-
tember 2018 and February 2019 (inclusive). We filter out any power
and interaction experiments conducted during this period. The
uncontrolled experiments were conducted on the US testbed only.
To measure regional differences in IoT traffic, we use two ap-
proaches. First, we compare information exposed by the common
devices across the UK and US labs. Any differences in informa-
tion exposure could be explained by factors such as differences
in hardware/firmware sold in different markets, egress IP address,
server selection based on IP address or location, and data protection
regulations in each jurisdiction. Second, we use the VPN connec-
tion between labs to compare US devices egressing into the public
Internet via a US IP address, and the same devices egressing via
a UK IP (and vice versa for the UK lab devices). In this case, the
hardware/firmware and jurisdiction are identical in each pair of sce-
narios, but the egress IP address (and server selection based on the
IP) vary. We combine observations across these scenarios to help
identify likely root causes for observed differences in information
exposure.
4 DESTINATION ANALYSIS
In this section, we characterize IoT devices in terms of the destina-
tions of their network traffic in order to answer the RQ1. Our focus
is on which parties are contacted (as defined in §2.1), their geoloca-
tion, and what are the most common non-first-parties contacted.
4.1 Measuring Destinations
In this section we analyze the destination IP address of IoT device
traffic according to whether the destination is a first party, third
party, or support party.1 In addition, we consider the geolocation
of those destinations (in terms of inferred country), because traffic
traversing international boundaries may be subject to different
domestic surveillance regulations, and because different countries
may impose different restrictions on content providers. We use
the following approach to label the party and geolocation for a
destination IP.
For each flow from a de-
Second level domain name (SLD).
vice, we determine the SLD by first identifying whether the destina-
tion IP address corresponds to a DNS response for a request issued
by the device. If so, we use the SLD for the corresponding DNS
lookup; otherwise, we search HTTP headers (Host field) and/or
TLS handshakes (Server Name Indication field) for the domain. If
none of the above approaches yields a domain, we leave the IP’s
SLD unlabeled.
Identifying organization name. We identify the organiza-
tion name for an SLD using either WHOIS data or common-sense
matching rules (e.g., “Google” is the organization for google.com). If
we could not identify an SLD for a domain, we set the organization
to the owner of the IP address as reported by the corresponding
regional registry (e.g., RIPE for European IPs).
If the IP’s organization identified

in the previous step matches the name, manufacturer, or related
company to the IoT device, we classify it as a first party. If not,
we manually search for public information about the party. If the
company states on its website that it is specialized in providing con-
nectivity (CDN) or cloud services (e.g., Amazon AWS), we consider
the party a support party. In any other case we consider the party
a third party.
Determining party country. We use the Passport [36] tool,
which is able to infer the country containing a destination IP address
by combining traceroute data with other IP geolocation sources.
We do not use public geolocation databases alone, which we found
to be highly inaccurate when manually validating results.
4.2 Destination Characterization
Table 2 shows the number of unique destinations for each type of
experiment contacted by the US and UK devices. The first column of
the table shows the type of experiment, the second column the type
of party (support vs third), the remaining columns indicate values
referring to a group of devices using the following notation that

grouped by experiment type (first column), party type (sec-
ond column) across lab location and network connectivity
(right columns).
we will use for the remainder of the paper: “US” and “UK” headers
represent all US and all UK devices, US∩ and UK∩ headers represent
only the US and UK devices that are in common between the two
labs, headers prefixed with “VPN” indicate that those devices are
connected to the Internet using the VPN link (meaning that US
devices reach the Internet via the public IP address of the UK testbed,
and vice versa).
The table shows that control experiments lead to more commu-
nication to support and third parties when compared to other types
of experiments. Among them, the power experiments represent
the majority of the communications with third parties, likely due
to devices establishing initial connections with destination parties.
During the power experiments devices in the US contacted net-
flix.com, tuyaus.com (a Chinese IoT provider), nuri.net (a Korean
ISP), and facebook.com. UK devices communicate with nuri.net, net-
flix.com, and doubleclick.net. During the control experiments there
are two third parties contacted only by US-based devices: omtrdc.net
(a tracking service owned by Adobe) and mixpanel.com (another
tracking service), and one contacted only by the UK-based devices:
wowinc.com (a US ISP). The latter is a Wansview camera, which we
observed to contact IPs in many residential networks.
The total number of contacted parties (bottom rows) in the US
is greater than the same for the UK. The Wansview camera con-
tacts the largest number of destinations (52 unique destinations),
followed by Samsung TV (30), Roku TV (15), and TP-Link plug (13).
Interestingly, when US devices are connected via the UK net-
work (using VPN), they contact a lower number of parties. Among
them: branch.io (tracking service), fastly.net (CDN), edgecastcdn.net
(CDN owned by Verizon), and hvvc.us (cloud hosting). Branch.io is
contacted by Fire TV, TP-Link plug and TP-Link bulb during the
power experiment.
Table 3 shows the number of unique destinations per category
in the two datasets. TVs (i.e., Samsung TV, LG TV, Roku, Fire TV)
contact the largest number of third parties among all device cate-
gories.
Figure 2 shows the flow of traffic from the devices common to
the US (left) and UK (right) labs, with the height of each band corre-
sponding to the number of bytes transferred. Results are grouped by
the device category (left middle and right middle) and terminate at
destination countries/regions (center). A majority of device traffic
terminates in the US for both the US and UK labs, likely due to
reliance on infrastructure with limited geodiversity.
