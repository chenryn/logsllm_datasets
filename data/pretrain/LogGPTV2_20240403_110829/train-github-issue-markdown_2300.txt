If state is currently:
    {
       foo: 123,
       user: {typing: false, active: false}
    }
Then calling `this.setState({user: {typing: true}})` results in state being:
    {
       foo: 123,
       user: {typing: true}
    }
It would be great to have a `setStateRecursively` function and to make it
clear in the `setState` documentation that it only merges one level deep
before just replacing sub-states.
