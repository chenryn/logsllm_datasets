Question: "When a user sets a passcode on an iOS device, several security mechanisms are engaged to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Which of the following statements correctly describe the role of the user's passcode in securing data on the device?"
 "A": "The passcode is directly used as the file system key to encrypt each file's metadata on the device."
 "B": "The passcode is entangled with the device's UID to create a Passcode-derived key (PDK), which is used in the encryption process."
 "C": "The passcode undergoes a tangling process to strengthen a cryptographic key that is then used to wrap the per-file key for each file."
 "D": "A user's passcode is stored in Effaceable Storage to enable rapid access and encryption of data each time the device is unlocked."
