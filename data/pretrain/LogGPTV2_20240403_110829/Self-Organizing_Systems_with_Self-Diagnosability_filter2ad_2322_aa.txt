Abstract
Constructing a system capable of functioning without
any human support over an extended period is the aim of
many engineers. However it is generally considered to be
difﬁcult to make decentralized self-organizing autonomous
system fault-tolerant. In this paper, we propose to apply the
theory of highly structured self-diagnosable systems to this
problem. As an example, we apply the theory and recursive
procedures method of fault-tolerant system construction to
a decentralized self-organizing autonomous robotic system
that forms a circle. The result of simulation shows the use-
fulness of the proposed method. The highly structured self-
diagnosable system has an O(|E|) fault-identiﬁcation algo-
rithm that can diagnose each of the units in the system inde-
pendently, locally and in any order, where E and |E| mean
the set of the directed edges and its cardinality, respectively.
1 Introduction
This paper presents a method of constructing a fault-
tolerant system which can be applied to many kinds of dis-
tributed systems such as the Internet, certiﬁcation authori-
ties (CAs) in public key infrastructure (PKI) [5], [19], and
multi-agent systems [20]. Topology-free structure is one of
the distinguished features of the output of this method.
In computer networks and distributed systems, fault-
tolerance is one of the important issues [16]. The difﬁcult
point in making distributed systems fault-tolerant is that
the structure of the distributed systems varies greatly de-
pending on the design assumption [2], [6], [18], [21]. How-
ever, if we regard each unit that composes a distributed sys-
tem as a computer, the total system can be considered to
be a distributed computer network system that dynamically
changes its topology. Such metaphor motivates us to in-
troduce the self-diagnosable system in which each network
unit tests some other units and the faulty units are identiﬁed
by using these test results.
The classical model of the self-diagnosable system was
ﬁrstly presented in the study of Preparata, Metze, and
Chien [17].
In this so-called PMC model, the system is
composed of n units, and each unit is tested by some other
units. The collection of test outcomes, or “syndrome,”
classiﬁes the units as faulty or fault-free. If all the faulty
units can be identiﬁed from a given syndrome under the
assumption that the number of faulty units does not ex-
ceed the given bound t, then the system is called a “one-
step t-fault diagnosable system.” On the other hand, if at
least one of the faulty units can be identiﬁed from a given
syndrome, the system is called a “sequentially t-fault di-
agnosable system.” The theory of system-level fault diag-
nosis using the PMC model has been extensively studied
[1], [4], [10], [13], [14], [25].
Using the PMC model, Kohda [8], [11] presented a spe-
cial class of diagnosable systems called the “highly struc-
tured system” for identifying faulty units efﬁciently. In the
system, each unit, called a “kernel unit,” is assumed to have
a subsystem composed of (2µ + ν + 1) units and (2µ + ν)

test links. The faulty or fault-free status of the kernel unit is
identiﬁed by test results arising from the local subsystems.
As a result, all of the faulty units are independently and lo-
cally identiﬁed in O(|E|) time complexity where E and |E|
mean the set of the directed edges and its cardinality, re-
spectively. Furthermore Kohda and Mitsuoka [9] gave the
two recursive procedures for optimally designing the sys-
tem having no mutual tests. The recursive procedures have
been shown to be of great ﬂexibility.
In this paper, we propose using the highly structured
self-diagnosable systems to identify the faulty units in dis-
tributed systems. Using a common, yet simple example, we
decided to use a decentralized self-organizing autonomous
robotic system that forms a circumference [22], [23]. We
then applied the recursive procedures of the fault-tolerant
system construction to this robotic system. The results of
the simulation show the usefulness of the proposed method.
2 Deﬁnitions and Theories of Self-Diagnos-
able Systems
In this section, the concepts of the PMC model and the
highly structured self-diagnosable system are described.
The theoretical model for system-level fault diagnosis
of computer networks was presented by Preparata, Metze,
and Chien [17].
In this so-called PMC model, the self-
diagnosable system S is represented by a directed graph
G = [V , E], where V is a set of vertices, and E, a set of
edges. The vertex v ∈ V corresponds to the unit in the
system S; the directed edge (v, u), with its binary weight
a(v, u), corresponds to the test where v and u are the test-
ing and tested units, respectively, and a(v, u) is the test out-
come. The test outcome a(v, u) is “0” (“1”) if v diagnoses
u as “fault-free” (“faulty”). If v is faulty, then the outcome
a(v, u) is unreliable. The outcome matrix shown in Table 1
speciﬁes the possible outcomes of tests for all combinations
of faulty (PF) and fault-free (FF) conditions for the units v
and u. The “P” in “PF” stands for “permanent. ” This means
that units do not change their condition (faulty or fault-free)
throughout the diagnostic testing.

FF and PF indicate a fault-free and a perma-
nently faulty unit, respectively.

ing of (2µ + ν + 1) units and of (2µ + ν) test
links for a kernel unit v.
Preparata et al. proposed a one-step t-fault diagnosable
system that can identify all the permanently faulty units
from a given syndrome in one-step.
Deﬁnition 1 (Preparata et al. [17]) A system is deﬁned as
a “ one-step t-fault diagnosable system (abbreviated to t-
OD system)” when all faulty units within the system can
be identiﬁed without replacement, provided the number of
faulty units does not exceed t.
Hakimi and Amin [4] presented the necessary and sufﬁ-
cient conditions for a system S to be t-OD as follows:
Theorem 1 (Hakimi and Amin [4]) Let G be the directed
graph of a system S with n units. Then S is t-OD if and only
if: 1) n ≥ 2t + 1; 2) din(v) ≥ t, for all v ∈ V ; and 3) for
each integer p with 0 ≤ p  p, where Γ(X) =
Γ(v) = {u|(v, u) ∈ E}.
(cid:1)
u∈X
Condtion 2 of Theorem 1 gives :
Deﬁnition 2 (Preparata et al. [17]) A t-OD system of n
units is said to be optimal if and only if the number of test
is minimum, that is, nt.
On the basis of the PMC model, Kohda [8], [11] deﬁned
the highly structured system:
Deﬁnition 3 (Kohda [8], [11]) If any unit v in the system S
has a subsystem H (v; µ, ν) illustrated in Fig. 1 and deﬁned
as
H(v; µ, ν) = [V0(v; µ, ν), E0(v; µ, ν)],
V0(v; µ, ν) = {v, x1, . . . , xµ, y1, . . . , yµ, z1, . . . , zν},
E0(v; µ, ν) = {(yi, xi), (xi, v)|1 ≤ i ≤ µ} ∪
{(zj, v)|1 ≤ j ≤ ν},
then S is referred to as a “ highly structured system,” where
the unit v is called a “ kernel unit,” and the nonnegative in-
tegers µ, ν are the numbers of test sequences respectively
of length 2 and of length 1 applied to v.

2-OD system having no mutual tests.
Remark 1 The fault diagnosis in Theorem 3 has the fol-
lowing remarkable properties: (i) The number of tests is
minimum, that is, the system is optimal. Each unit can be
diagnosed (ii) independently, (iii) locally, (iv) in any order,
and (v) without using the result of tests done by itself. (vi)
The system is applicable to hybrid fault situations[4].
In order to demonstrate the properties of the highly struc-
tured system, we give the following example.
Example 1 Consider an optimal highly structured 5-unit 2-
OD system having no mutual tests shown in Fig. 3. Table 2
shows all of the possible syndromes when the units v2 and
v3 are permanently faulty and all the other units are fault-
free. Note that each subsystem H(v; 2, 0) of a kernel unit
v consists of a pair of units, {xi, yi}, and two consecutive
tests {(xi, v), (yi, xi)}. Table 2 also shows each subsys-
tem, all of the possible test outcomes in the subsystem, and
all of the possible identiﬁed states of v evaluated by The-
orem 3. In this table, the symbol * denotes either 0 or 1.
Table 2 shows that the permanently faulty units v2 and v3
and all the fault-free units are identiﬁed correctly.
Theorem 2 (Kohda [8]) Let t be a nonnegative integer and
the system S be a highly structured system. Then S is a
t-OD system if any unit v in S has a subsystem H (v; µ, ν)
and the values of µ and ν satisfy

≥ t,
where (cid:10)x(cid:11) is the largest integer not greater than x. Such a
system is called a “ highly structured t-OD system.”
For the highly structured t-OD system, the following theo-
rems hold:
Theorem 3 (Kohda [8]) Let S be a highly structured t-OD
system. Then a unit v in S is fault-free if and only if the
integer-valued indicator deﬁned by
δ(H(v; µ, ν)) ≡ p1 +
− (p4 + p6)

is nonnegative, where pk (k=1,. . .,6) is the number of the
test outcome pattern of type Pk illustrated in Fig. 2.
Theorem 4 (Kohda and Mitsuoka [9]) If S is a highly
structured t-OD system, then S is t-OD with a time com-
plexity O(nt) ≤ O(|E|).
