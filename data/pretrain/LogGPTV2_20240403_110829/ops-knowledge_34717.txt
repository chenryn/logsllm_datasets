User: I have been asked to choose a project for my Operating System course at my university. I was bubbled with the idea of making an Operating System from scratch in Python. 
I have a few limitations: 

I have only 3 months. 
I want to do it in Python. 
I can put in say 20-30 hours every week into it. 

I want to know, how feasible is the idea? Like how far can I go in building the same. I would be very happy, if I can get a basic version running (something with a handful of very basic apps running.) Is it possible with the given limitations?
Is there a book that can help me like a guideline? (need not be for python, I just need a guide to tell me how I should go about making the OS)
If the idea is not feasible, can anyone tell me how much do I need to scale down my idea? 
Any help is much appreciated!
Assistant: Scale this down a lot.  I would recommend looking at one very small piece of an operating system that you would want to do, perhaps parallel processing.  There is no feasible way you will be able to write an entire operating system in under 500 hours, let only 5000 hours. The real question is is this for an undergraduate course or a graduate course?  The answer to that will greatly reflect what is needed to pass.
Adding
Grab a book on a topic about the operating system that interests you and focus intently on that for 3 months and you may just produce something that is good.  Operating systems may seem like they don't do much on the outside, but think of it this way Windows has ~50 million lines of code.
