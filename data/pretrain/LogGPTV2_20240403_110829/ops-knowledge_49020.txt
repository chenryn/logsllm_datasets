User: Windows 7: I'm using Python3.2 with IDLE. Every time I edit and load my program, I get a new "pythonw.exe *32" process (as shown by Windows Task Manager)--even if the program just prints Hello World.
This is a special nuisance if the program is on a static RAM drive, because then I have to kill each of these processes individually before I can eject my drive.
Is this a bug in IDLE? Is there a way I can prevent this from happening? Or at least, is there a way I can kill all these pythonw processes at once, instead of one at a time?
Assistant: Upgrade to version 3.2.2.  That fixed the bug for me.  I saw the same thing in 3.2.1.
