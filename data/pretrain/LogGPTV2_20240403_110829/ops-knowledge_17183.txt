Question: "As a security analyst, you are reviewing the security implications of browser behaviors as they relate to web security and the Same-Origin Policy. Considering the potential benefits and drawbacks, which of the following statements accurately describe the security implications of these behaviors?"
 "A": "Strict enforcement of SOP prevents cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks by disallowing any cross-origin requests, including image fetches and links."
 "B": "Cookies that are labeled as 'SameSite=Strict' are not sent with requests originating from another site, which mitigates the risk of CSRF attacks but could disrupt the user experience when navigating across sites."
 "C": "Allowing inter-domain <IMG> tags benefits content sharing and reduces server load but may expose the application to CSRF risks if cookies are sent along with these image requests."
 "D": "Setting cookies with a 'Domain' attribute that is a suffix of the site's DNS name enhances the flexibility of cookie use across subdomains but could heighten the risk of cookie interception or misuse."
