ABSTRACT
Multihoming is often used by large enterprises and stub ISPs to
connect to the Internet. In this paper, we design a series of novel
smart routing algorithms to optimize cost and performance for mul-
tihomed users. We evaluate our algorithms through both analysis
and extensive simulations based on realistic charging models, traf-
ﬁc demands, performance data, and network topologies. Our re-
sults suggest that these algorithms are very effective in minimizing
cost and at the same time improving performance. We further ex-
amine the equilibrium performance of smart routing in a global set-
ting and show that a smart routing user can improve its performance
without adversely affecting other users.

INTRODUCTION
Multihoming [31] is often used by large enterprises and stub ISPs
to connect to the Internet because of its perceived beneﬁts in re-
liability, cost, or performance. A customer or ISP network (also
called a user) with multiple external links (either to a single ISP, or
to different providers) is said to be multihomed [31]. When a user
actively controls how its trafﬁc is distributed among its multiple
links to the Internet, we refer to it as implementing smart routing.
Smart routing is also referred to as route optimization, or intelligent
route control.
Smart routing can potentially be useful in the following ways.
First, smart routing may help to improve network performance and

reliability. Recent studies [27, 32, 33] have shown that when com-
pared with the ideal routing, network-level routing often yields sub-
optimal user performance due to routing hierarchy and BGP pol-
icy routing. Equipment failure, transient instability, and network
congestion may also affect user performance. Smart routing of-
fers a way for end users to exercise control over routes.
In [1],
Akella et al. quantify the potential beneﬁts of smart routing and
suggest that selecting the right set of providers can yield some per-
formance improvement. In [2], Akella et al. observe that the la-
tency and throughput achieved by multihoming to three ISPs are
within 5-15% of overlay routing employed in conjunction with 3-
multihoming. Second, when taking into account speciﬁc charg-
ing models, smart routing can potentially reduce users’ ﬁnancial
cost. A recent economic analysis shows that smart routing has
the potential to beneﬁt not only the end users, but also the service
providers [8].
Given the potential beneﬁts of smart routing and the large num-
ber of multihomed users, many companies are actively developing
software to implement smart routing, e.g., [12, 19, 21, 24]. How-
ever, since these are commercial products, their technical details
are not available, and their performance and impact on the Internet
are not well understood. While there are a few research studies on
smart routing, e.g., [1, 11], the focus of these studies is on network
performance only; users’ cost, which is another major incentive to
use multihoming, is not considered. In addition, previous studies
focus on the potential performance beneﬁts, not on the design of al-
gorithms; it remains an open question how such potential beneﬁts
can be achieved in practice.
In this paper, we attempt to realize some of the beneﬁts of smart
routing by developing a series of novel algorithms for optimizing
both cost and performance for multihomed users. We ﬁrst demon-
strate that optimizing network performance alone can signiﬁcantly
increase the cost of a user, thus rendering smart routing less at-
tractive. To address this issue, we propose novel ofﬂine and on-
line routing algorithms to minimize a user’s cost under common
usage-based charging models. Using realistic pricing data and traf-
ﬁc demand traces from universities and enterprises, we show that
despite ﬂuctuations in trafﬁc, our online algorithm can signiﬁcantly
reduce a user’s cost, compared with using dedicated links or apply-
ing round robin or equal split algorithms to burstable links. We
also design online and ofﬂine algorithms to optimize the network
performance of a smart routing user under cost constraints. Using
realistic pricing data, trafﬁc demand traces, and latency traces, we
show that our online algorithm achieves performance within 10–
20% of the optimal ofﬂine algorithm.
In this paper we assume that the user is already multihomed to
a set of ISPs. Thus, we focus on how to dynamically assign trafﬁc
among them to optimize cost and performance. The business deci-
sions of whether to use multihoming and which ISPs to choose are
by themselves very complicated and may involve many technical
and non-technical factors, which we do not attempt to address in
79this paper. We also assume that cost and performance are the main
factors of interest to the user. For many real Internet services such
as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), however, optimizing cost and
performance alone may not be enough. Other factors such as ease
of management, ease of trouble-shooting, security, and Quality-of-
Service (QoS) also play critical roles in users’ business decisions.
So our techniques are not directly applicable in such contexts. Nev-
ertheless, we believe that in order to better understand the potential
role of smart routing in the future Internet, it is important to go
beyond previous performance-centric studies by placing both cost
and performance in a common optimization framework.
Besides developing techniques for optimizing cost and perfor-
mance, we also evaluate the global effects of such optimization. We
note that smart routing becomes a selﬁsh routing scheme when each
individual smart routing user adaptively changes its routes to opti-
mize its own metrics without considering its effects on the network.
Such adaptation changes network performance and may cause self-
interference or interference with other smart routing or regular (i.e.,
single-homed) trafﬁc. It remains to be seen whether smart routing
can retain its performance beneﬁts in the presence of such forms of
interference.
We use extensive simulations to study the global effects of smart
routing. We ﬁrst examine the equilibrium performance of smart
routing in the presence of self-interference (i.e., when the rout-
ing decisions made by the smart routing user change the network
performance, which in turn interferes with the decisions involved
in smart routing). Our results suggest that even in the presence
of self-interference, our algorithms still achieve good equilibrium
performance. We then evaluate how smart routing trafﬁc interacts
with other smart routing trafﬁc as well as with single-homed trafﬁc.
Our evaluations are based on an inter-domain network topology and
user demands from real trafﬁc traces. Our results show that smart
routing improves performance without degrading the performance
of other trafﬁc.
Our key contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We design ofﬂine and online algorithms to minimize cost
based on realistic usage-based charging models.
For instance, the authors in [4, 27] propose using overlay routing
to improve user performance. Achieving a large scale deployment
with this approach is challenging, as cooperation among multiple
organizations is not easy to arrange in practice.
Multihoming is an alternative way to enable users to control
routes. Many large enterprises, stub ISPs and even small businesses
already use multihoming as a way to connect to the Internet.
Much of the previous work on multihoming focuses on how to
design protocols to implement multihoming, e.g., [5, 7, 11, 30].
For example, the authors of [5, 7, 12, 24, 30] use BGP peering as
an implementation technique. Another technique is through DNS
or NAT, which is used in [9, 21]. Our work differs from the above
in that we do not focus on the implementations, but instead on de-
signing algorithms to determine when and how much trafﬁc a user
should assign to different ISPs to optimize both performance and
cost. Consequently, our work is complementary to the above.
There are several papers that evaluate the beneﬁts of smart rout-
ing, including [8, 28, 29]. More recently, Akella et al. [1] quantify
the potential performance beneﬁts of multihoming using real Inter-
net traces. Their results show that smart routing has the potential to
achieve an average performance improvement of 25% or more for
a 2-multihomed user in most cases, and that most of the beneﬁt can
be achieved using 4 providers. Motivated by these results, we seek
to develop routing schemes to achieve such beneﬁts in practice. In
addition, we study the effects of un-coordinated route optimization
by multiple mutually interfering smart routing users.
Finally, there are a few research studies on designing algorithms
for smart routing, e.g., [1, 15, 17]. For example, Orda and Rom [17]
investigate where to place multihomed users and show that the
problem is NP-hard. Cao et al. [6] propose using hash functions
to achieve load balancing among multiple links. In [11], the au-
thors compare several route selection schemes in a local area net-
work and show that hashing can achieve performance comparable
to load-sensitive route selection. Our work differs from these stud-
ies in that we use both cost and network performance as metrics
of interest. We also study the interactions between multiple smart
routing users, and between smart routing and single-homed users.
• We design ofﬂine and online algorithms to optimize network
performance under cost constraints.
• We use both analysis and simulations based on realistic traf-
ﬁc and performance data to demonstrate that our algorithms
yield good performance and low cost.
• We evaluate the performance of smart routing when multiple
users selﬁshly optimize their own cost and performance. We
ﬁnd that under this setting, smart routing trafﬁc interacts well
with other trafﬁc under trafﬁc equilibria.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
review related work.
In Section 3, we discuss our network and
charging models. In Section 4, we motivate the importance of opti-
mizing cost and present novel cost optimization algorithms. In Sec-
tion 5, we optimize network latency under given cost constraints.
We present the methodology and results of our evaluations in Sec-
tion 6. In Section 7, we study the global effects of smart routing
and evaluate its interactions with other trafﬁc. We conclude and
discuss future work in Section 8.
2. RELATED WORK
Several recent studies have shown that Internet routing often
yields sub-optimal user performance, e.g., [4, 27, 32, 33]. There
are a number of contributing factors, including routing hierarchy,
policy routing, and slow reaction (if any) to transient network con-
gestion or failures. BGP routing instabilities can further exacerbate
the problem. These observations have generated considerable re-
search interest in offering end-users more control in route selection.
3. NETWORK AND CHARGING MODELS
In this section, we describe our network model, ISP charging
models, and the performance metric we use.
3.1 Network Model
Figure 1: An illustration of a user with K service providers.
A multihomed user has multiple links to the Internet for sending
and receiving trafﬁc, as shown in Figure 1. The implementation
techniques of distributing trafﬁc to the links are different for outgo-
ing and incoming trafﬁc. For outgoing trafﬁc, a border router inside
the user’s network can actively control how trafﬁc is distributed.
For incoming trafﬁc, a user can use NAT or DNS to control the
routes. For more detailed discussions about the implementations,
we refer the readers to [1, 5, 7, 11, 30].
Note that the implementations of multihoming are complemen-
tary to our study, as our focus is on determining when and how
much trafﬁc should be assigned to each link. Consequently, our
ISP KWANuserISP 2ISP 1algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of multihoming im-
plementations, and work for both out-going and incoming trafﬁc.
Since our trafﬁc traces, as described below, consist of only out-
going trafﬁc, we evaluate trafﬁc assignment only in the out-bound
direction in this paper.
3.2 Charging Models
Users pay ISPs for using their service. The cost incurred is usu-
ally based on the amount of trafﬁc a user generates, i.e., cost =
c(x), where x is a variable determined by a user’s trafﬁc (which
we will term the charging volume) and c is a non-decreasing func-
tion that maps x to cost. Various charging models differ from one
another in their choices of charging volume x and cost function c.
Usually, the cost function c is a piece-wise linear (non-decreasing)
function, which we will use for our design and evaluation. There
are several ways in which the charging volume x can be deter-
mined. Percentile-based charging and total-volume based charging
are both in common use.
• Percentile-based charging: This is a typical usage-based charg-
ing scheme currently in use by ISPs [26]. Under this scheme,
an ISP records the trafﬁc volume a user generates during
every 5-minute interval. At the end of a complete charg-
ing period, the q-th percentile of all 5-minute trafﬁc volumes
is used as the charging volume x for q-percentile charging.
More speciﬁcally, the ISP sorts the 5-minute trafﬁc volumes
collected during the charging period in ascending order, and
then computes the charging volume x as the (q%×I)-th vol-
ume, where I is the number of intervals in a charging period.
For example, if 95th-percentile charging is in use and the
charging period is 30 days, then the cost is based on the traf-
ﬁc volume sent during the 8208-th (95%×30×24×60/5 =
8208) sorted interval.
• Total-volume based charging: This is a straightforward charg-
ing model, where the charging volume x is the total volume
of trafﬁc a user generates during the entire charging period.
In this paper, we focus primarily on percentile-based charging.
We describe how to deal with total-volume based charging in Ap-
pendix C. In our evaluations, we use two sets of pricing functions.
The ﬁrst set of functions are simple pricing functions: if the charg-
ing volume is 0, the price is 0; otherwise, the price is a constant
value. We pick the values from the entries in Table 1, which is pub-
lished in [25].1 In this table, a burstable link is a link whose price
is determined by the percentile-based charging model; a full-rate
link is also called a dedicated link and has a ﬁxed price indepen-
dent of usage. To evaluate the sensitivity of our algorithms to cost
functions, we also use another set of functions shown in Figure 2.
These functions are the more complex step functions. The prices at
24 Mbps for DS3 and at 100 Mbps for OC3 match those in Table 1.
The overall trend of the pricing curves reﬂects the general pricing
practice of decreasing unit cost as bandwidth increases; it is also
consistent with the pricing curves we are aware of, e.g., [3, 18].
3.3 Network Performance Metric
There are several ways to measure network performance. In our
evaluations, we use end-to-end latency as the metric. As shown
in [24], latency not only reﬂects network response time but also
serves as a measure of availability, as users often consider large
