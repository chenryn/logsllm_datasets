## Abstract
Multihoming is a common practice used by large enterprises and stub ISPs to connect to the Internet, offering benefits in reliability, cost, and performance. In this paper, we design and evaluate a series of novel smart routing algorithms to optimize both cost and performance for multihomed users. Our algorithms are evaluated through both analytical methods and extensive simulations based on realistic charging models, traffic demands, performance data, and network topologies. The results indicate that our algorithms effectively minimize costs while improving performance. We also examine the equilibrium performance of smart routing in a global setting and show that a smart routing user can enhance its performance without negatively impacting other users.

## 1. Introduction
Multihoming [31] is frequently adopted by large enterprises and stub ISPs to connect to the Internet due to its perceived advantages in reliability, cost, and performance. A customer or ISP network with multiple external links (either to a single ISP or different providers) is considered multihomed [31]. When a user actively controls how its traffic is distributed among these multiple links, it is referred to as implementing smart routing. Smart routing, also known as route optimization or intelligent route control, can potentially improve network performance and reliability.

Recent studies [27, 32, 33] have shown that network-level routing often yields suboptimal user performance due to routing hierarchy and BGP policy routing. Equipment failure, transient instability, and network congestion can also affect user performance. Smart routing offers a way for end users to exercise control over their routes. Akella et al. [1] quantify the potential benefits of smart routing, suggesting that selecting the right set of providers can yield significant performance improvements. In [2], they observe that the latency and throughput achieved by multihoming to three ISPs are within 5-15% of overlay routing employed in conjunction with 3-multihoming. Additionally, smart routing can reduce financial costs when specific charging models are considered [8].

Given the potential benefits of smart routing and the large number of multihomed users, many companies are developing software to implement smart routing. However, the technical details of these commercial products are not publicly available, and their performance and impact on the Internet are not well understood. While there are some research studies on smart routing, they focus primarily on network performance and do not consider users' costs. Furthermore, these studies do not address the design of algorithms to achieve the potential benefits in practice.

In this paper, we aim to realize the benefits of smart routing by developing a series of novel algorithms to optimize both cost and performance for multihomed users. We demonstrate that optimizing network performance alone can significantly increase a user's cost, making smart routing less attractive. To address this, we propose offline and online routing algorithms to minimize a user's cost under common usage-based charging models. Using realistic pricing data and traffic demand traces from universities and enterprises, we show that our online algorithm can significantly reduce a user's cost compared to using dedicated links or applying round-robin or equal-split algorithms to burstable links. We also design online and offline algorithms to optimize network performance under cost constraints. Using realistic pricing data, traffic demand traces, and latency traces, we show that our online algorithm achieves performance within 10–20% of the optimal offline algorithm.

We assume that the user is already multihomed to a set of ISPs, focusing on how to dynamically assign traffic among them to optimize cost and performance. The business decisions of whether to use multihoming and which ISPs to choose are complex and involve many technical and non-technical factors, which we do not address. We also assume that cost and performance are the main factors of interest to the user. For many real Internet services such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), optimizing cost and performance alone may not be sufficient. Other factors like ease of management, troubleshooting, security, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) also play critical roles. Therefore, our techniques are not directly applicable in such contexts. However, understanding the potential role of smart routing in the future Internet requires placing both cost and performance in a common optimization framework.

Besides developing optimization techniques, we evaluate the global effects of smart routing. Smart routing becomes a selfish routing scheme when each individual user adaptively changes its routes to optimize its own metrics without considering the impact on the network. Such adaptation can change network performance and cause self-interference or interference with other smart routing or regular (single-homed) traffic. We use extensive simulations to study the global effects of smart routing. Our results suggest that even in the presence of self-interference, our algorithms still achieve good equilibrium performance. We also evaluate how smart routing traffic interacts with other smart routing traffic and single-homed traffic, showing that smart routing improves performance without degrading the performance of other traffic.

Our key contributions include:
- Designing offline and online algorithms to minimize cost based on realistic usage-based charging models.
- Designing offline and online algorithms to optimize network performance under cost constraints.
- Using both analysis and simulations based on realistic traffic and performance data to demonstrate that our algorithms yield good performance and low cost.
- Evaluating the performance of smart routing when multiple users selfishly optimize their own cost and performance, finding that smart routing traffic interacts well with other traffic under traffic equilibria.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related work. In Section 3, we discuss our network and charging models. In Section 4, we present novel cost optimization algorithms. In Section 5, we optimize network latency under given cost constraints. In Section 6, we present the methodology and results of our evaluations. In Section 7, we study the global effects of smart routing and evaluate its interactions with other traffic. We conclude and discuss future work in Section 8.

## 2. Related Work
Several recent studies have shown that Internet routing often yields sub-optimal user performance [4, 27, 32, 33]. Contributing factors include routing hierarchy, policy routing, and slow reaction to transient network congestion or failures. BGP routing instabilities further exacerbate the problem. These observations have generated considerable research interest in offering end-users more control in route selection.

## 3. Network and Charging Models
### 3.1 Network Model
A multihomed user has multiple links to the Internet for sending and receiving traffic, as shown in Figure 1. The implementation techniques for distributing traffic to the links differ for outgoing and incoming traffic. For outgoing traffic, a border router inside the user’s network can actively control how traffic is distributed. For incoming traffic, a user can use NAT or DNS to control the routes. For detailed discussions about the implementations, we refer readers to [1, 5, 7, 11, 30].

Note that the implementations of multihoming are complementary to our study, as our focus is on determining when and how much traffic should be assigned to each link. Consequently, our algorithms can be applied to a wide variety of multihoming implementations and work for both outgoing and incoming traffic. Since our traffic traces consist of only outgoing traffic, we evaluate traffic assignment only in the outbound direction in this paper.

### 3.2 Charging Models
Users pay ISPs for using their service. The cost incurred is usually based on the amount of traffic a user generates, i.e., cost = c(x), where x is a variable determined by a user’s traffic (charging volume) and c is a non-decreasing function that maps x to cost. Various charging models differ in their choices of charging volume x and cost function c. Typically, the cost function c is a piece-wise linear (non-decreasing) function, which we will use for our design and evaluation. Common ways to determine the charging volume x include percentile-based and total-volume based charging.

- **Percentile-based charging**: This is a typical usage-based charging scheme currently in use by ISPs [26]. Under this scheme, an ISP records the traffic volume a user generates during every 5-minute interval. At the end of a complete charging period, the q-th percentile of all 5-minute traffic volumes is used as the charging volume x for q-percentile charging. For example, if 95th-percentile charging is in use and the charging period is 30 days, then the cost is based on the traffic volume sent during the 8208-th (95%×30×24×60/5 = 8208) sorted interval.
  
- **Total-volume based charging**: This is a straightforward charging model where the charging volume x is the total volume of traffic a user generates during the entire charging period.

In this paper, we focus primarily on percentile-based charging. We describe how to deal with total-volume based charging in Appendix C. In our evaluations, we use two sets of pricing functions. The first set of functions are simple pricing functions: if the charging volume is 0, the price is 0; otherwise, the price is a constant value. We pick the values from Table 1, published in [25]. In this table, a burstable link is a link whose price is determined by the percentile-based charging model; a full-rate link is also called a dedicated link and has a fixed price independent of usage. To evaluate the sensitivity of our algorithms to cost functions, we also use another set of functions shown in Figure 2. These functions are more complex step functions. The prices at 24 Mbps for DS3 and at 100 Mbps for OC3 match those in Table 1. The overall trend of the pricing curves reflects the general pricing practice of decreasing unit cost as bandwidth increases, consistent with the pricing curves we are aware of, e.g., [3, 18].

### 3.3 Network Performance Metric
There are several ways to measure network performance. In our evaluations, we use end-to-end latency as the metric. As shown in [24], latency not only reflects network response time but also serves as a measure of availability, as users often consider large latencies as indicative of poor service quality.
