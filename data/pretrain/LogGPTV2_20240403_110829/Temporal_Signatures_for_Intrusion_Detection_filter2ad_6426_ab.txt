### 3.1 Removing High-Variance (Unusable) Data

To ensure the quality and reliability of our data, we need to remove high-variance data points. Based on the assumption that time intervals follow a normal distribution, we have developed a quantitative method for excluding high-variance data. This method involves three steps: removing high-variance cases, excluding data for high-variance system calls, and marking unusable clusters.

#### 3.1.1 Removing High-Variance Cases

First, we identify and remove high-variance cases. For example, consider Case 11, which has a single divergent time measure associated with `seteuid` that significantly deviates from the mean. Given the low probability of such high-variance time intervals in a normal distribution, we exclude the entire Case 11 to prevent it from affecting the cluster summary.

To determine the criteria for exclusion, we use the z-score, a common statistical measure. The z-score represents the number of standard deviations an interval is from its mean. Let \( t_i \), \( m_i \), and \( s_i \) represent the time interval, mean, and standard deviation of the \( i \)-th system call, respectively. The z-score can be calculated as:

\[ z_i = \frac{t_i - m_i}{s_i} \]

The z-score follows a standard normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. By comparing z-scores, we can identify abnormal data. For instance, if we define all data with a probability less than 5% as abnormal, we compare the z-score to 2.33, which is the maximum permitted z-value for 5% abnormal cases. If the z-score of a time interval exceeds 2.33, it is considered abnormal, and the entire case is excluded.

| bind        | 1.62   | 1.62   | 1.13   | 1.66   | 0.99   | 1.79   | 1.79   | 1.29   | 1.92   | 3.17    | 0.99    | 0.996   | 0.793    | N/A                   | N/A         |

After exclusions, the mean and standard deviation for each column are recalculated. This process may need to be repeated iteratively until no further cases need to be excluded. Typically, two or three iterations are sufficient. In our example, one iteration is enough.

#### 3.1.2 Excluding Data of High-Variance System Calls

After removing high-variance cases, we need to consider the possibility of high-variance system calls. The standard deviation of the `open` column in Table 3 remains high. I/O (disk access) is typically the source of high variance, though network operations and, rarely, code algorithms can also exhibit high variance. Therefore, we remove the timing values of such system calls entirely from the cluster summary.

However, we do not remove the system call `open` from the title to maintain a consistent sequence length for all clusters. To address the issue of higher standard deviations with higher means, we compute a normalized standard deviation. We define \( C_s \) as a threshold that \( \frac{s}{m} \) cannot exceed. Any system call with a normalized standard deviation larger than \( C_s \) is considered a high-variance system call. \( C_s \) is typically set between 0.1 and 0.3 based on experimental observations.

| bind        | 1.69   | 1.56   | 1.69   | 1.69   | 1.62   | 0.92   | 1.69   | 2.02   | 1.22   | 1.83    | 0.92    | 0         | n/a                    | n/a   | n/a          |

Using \( C_s \) as a criterion is a simple method for determining which system call time measures to exclude. More formal statistical methods, such as the chi-square test, could be used, but they require assumptions that our model does not satisfy. Instead, we use a simpler, empirically-based approach.

Excluding the timing information of high-variance system calls does not affect the calculation of mean and deviation for other system calls, so they do not need to be recalculated. It is important to exclude high-variance cases before excluding high-variance system calls to avoid incorrectly excluding usable columns.

#### 3.1.3 Marking Unusable Clusters

Our experiments show that only a small percentage of total cases and system calls are typically excluded. However, it is necessary to check whether these exclusions have rendered the entire cluster unusable due to insufficient valid data.

We define the percentage of valid cases for a cluster as \( P_v \), which is the percentage of cases remaining after high-variance cases are excluded. A similar \( P_v \) value can be computed for an entire database or for a comparison. If \( P_v \) falls below a certain threshold, the cluster is marked as unusable.
