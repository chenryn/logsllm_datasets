**Current behavior**
When using multiple @ HostListener decorator on same function, such as code
below
      @HostListener('click', ['$event'])
      @HostListener('mouseover', ['$event'])
      @HostListener('focus',['$event'])
      private eventRouter(e) {
         console.log(e);
      }
Only the first decorator will be listened, but the function got the latest
decorator event, and the middle decorator and the last decorator will never be
trigger.
