User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the DisplayPowerController software component adjusting the brightness of the HBM (High Brightness Mode) with a target of 38 and a rate of 200. The StackScrollAlgorithm software component is also updating the clipping and dimmed activated hide sensitive settings with overlap set to false.
