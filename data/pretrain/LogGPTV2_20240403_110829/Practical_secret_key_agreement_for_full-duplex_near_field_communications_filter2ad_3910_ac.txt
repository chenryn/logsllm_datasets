bits on his side [010] and reverse them to get [101]. Eve who
only sees superposed RF signal, cannot know the 2nd, 4th
and 8th bits that Alice sends.
4.5 Discussion
We brieﬂy compare RIWA with the Elliptic Curve Diﬃe-
Hellman key exchange method(ECDH) [11].
4.5.1 Energy Consumption
For energy consumption, RIWA only needs simple compu-
tations of bit comparisons. The main energy consumption
is bit transmissions. To generate 128 bit key, considering
50% probability that a bit is eﬀective and the discard of
guard bits, the number of bits transmitted is about 512.
ECDH needs about 1 kbit transmission (both overheads of
ECDH and RIWA are not considered), which is a little more
than RIWA. More importantly, ECDH has high computa-
tional complexity; the energy consumed by computation of
the cryptographic operations is at least one order of magni-
tude larger than transmissions [11].
4.5.2 Time Consumption
For time consumption, to generate 128 bit key, RIWA
needs 512bit/106kbps = 4.8ms assuming 106 kBaud rate.
For ECDH, computations alone cost 9.1s to 15.1s [11].
4.5.3 How about MIMO Attacker
For NFC, the operating distance is within 10cm, signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than half of a wavelength (11m). In this case,
it is well known that MIMO techniques cannot separate their
signals. Hence, the eavesdropper cannot exploit MIMO to
decode the RFID’s data [19] . We believe our method deals
with major threats in NFC, and is generally applicable.
5. SIMULATIONS
In the following, we conduct numerical simulations to in-
vestigate our method. We set the baud rate to 106 kBaud.
The modulation is Manchester coding with 100% ASK. We
add random channel noises at Alice and Bob sides nt
a(t),

of Alice and Bob are ηa = ηb = 1.
5.1 RIWA’s Performance against Out of Syn-
chronization
In order to analyse RIWA’s performance against out of
synchronization, we generate a delay at Alice side, ε =
0.1µs. To deal with this delay, Alice and Bob both generate
a waveform shaking of γ0 = 0.5µs, (the amount of shaking is
about 1/10 of one bit duration, which is too small to cause
bit errors for Alice and Bob). For each simulation, Alice
and Bob both send 200 random bits. The chance that one
user send 1 and the other send 0 is 50%; so the number of
eﬀective bits is approximately 100. Alice and Bob discard
ineﬀective bits and generate the key with eﬀective bits using
the method introduced in section 4.1.
At Eve’s side, she uses the envelop of superposed RF wave-
form to guess the key. The scheme is shown in Fig. 14. She
ﬁrst detects whether the bit is an eﬀective bit. If most of the
sample points (70% in the simulation) is within the center
part (upper and lower threshold in the simulation are 0.4
and 0.6 respectively). She takes it for an eﬀective bit that
one user sends 1, and the other sends 0. She then observe
the middle part of the bit. If there is a peak (detect thresh-
old in the simulation is 0.7) he takes it as case 1, where Alice
sends 1, Bob sends 0. If there is a valley (detect threshold
in the simulation is 0.3), she takes it as case 2, where Alice
sends 0, Bob sends 1. If there is no peak or valley detected,
she will make a random guess.
We did the simulation 10000 times. The BER histogram
at Eve is shown in Fig. 15(left). Eve’s BER is 42% on
average, with a standard deviation of 6%. The result closes
to a random guess where BER is 50%.
We also investigate the impact of diﬀerent degrees of out
of synchronization on BER. We vary ε from 0.1µs to 1µs.
It makes the ratio of out of synchronization to shaking,
ε/2γ0, vary from 10% to 100%. The result is shown in Fig.
Figure 17:
(left) BER at eavesdropper trying to
break the key by amplitude mismatch (right) Key
generation rate under diﬀerent degrees of amplitude
mismatch
15(right). It can be seen that as ε increases, the number of
bits that Eve makes correct guess increases. When ε = 2γ0,
ε is too large that γ can not cover it. As a result, Eve can
completely determine the bit. Section 4.1 also proposed a
method to deal with large ε by discarding the bits that Eve
may discover. However, this will cause a drop on key gener-
ation rate. Fig. 16(left) shows the key generation rate un-
der diﬀerent degrees of out of synchronizations. As expect,
when ε increases, the key generation rate decreases. For
ε/2γ0 16dB, the key generation rate is larger than
20kbps.
5.2 RIWA’s Performance against Amplitude
Mismatch
In this simulation, we generate an amplitude mismatch
α = 1.1. To deal with it, Alice and Bob both generate an
amplitude shaking of β0 = 0.4. Manchester coding has half
high voltage and half low voltage (0 for 100%ASK). At
Eve’s side, she will see half bit of Alice’s high voltage and
half bit of Bob’s high voltage. She takes the higher one as
Alice’s high voltage and the other as Bob’s high voltage.
We run the simulation for 10000 times. The BER his-
togram at Eve is shown in Fig. 17(left). Eve’s BER is 44%
on average, with a standard deviation of 6%. The result
closes to a random guess where BER is 50%. As the de-
gree of amplitude mismatch increases, the number of bits
that Eve makes correct guess increases. In this case, we dis-
card the bits that Eve may discover. As a result, the key
generation rate decreases. Fig. 17(right) shows the key gen-
eration rate under diﬀerent degrees of amplitude mismatch.
For α < 1.2, the key generation rate is larger than 15kbps.

(left) BER at eavesdropper trying to
break the key by phase mismatch (right) Key gener-
ation rate under diﬀerent degrees of phase mismatch
5.3 RIWA’s Performance against Phase Mis-
match
In this simulation, we generate a phase mismatch at Bob’s
side θ = 1◦, where Alice’s initial phase is 0◦, and Bob’s initial
phase is 1◦. To deal with it, Alice and Bob both generate a
phase shaking with ϕ0 = 5◦. Eve will see two phases for one
bit duration. She chooses the RF waveform with a larger
initial phase as Bob’s RF waveform.
We run the simulation 10000 times. The BER histogram
at Eve is shown in Fig. 18(left). Eve’s BER is 48% on aver-
age, with a standard deviation of 5%. The result closes to a
random guess. As the degree of phase mismatch increases,
the number of bits that Eve makes correct guess increases.
In this case, we discard the bits that Eve may discover. As
a result, the key generation rate decreases. Fig. 18(right)
shows the Key generation rate under diﬀerent degrees of
phase mismatch. For θ < 3◦, the key generation rate is
larger than 20kbps.
6. EXPERIMENTS
We conduct experiments to prove the concept of RIWA.
We use software deﬁned radios, USRP n210 to simulate the
channels of NFC devices. We use BasicTX and BasicRX
Daughter board to send RF signals at 13.56MHz. We set
the baud rate to 106 kBaud. The modulation is Manchester
coding with 100% ASK. The sample rate is set to 2MHz,
that is 20 sample points a bit. The antennas are the DLP-
RFID-ANT antennas. We use a power splitter to implement
full-duplex on single antenna. The trunk port is connected
to antenna, and two branch ports are connected to TX and
RX respectively.
In the experiment, we aim at showing the eﬀectiveness
of RIWA dealing with the existence of out of synchroniza-
tion. The experiment set up is shown in Fig. 19. Eve’s
antenna is in the middle of Alice and Bob’s, so she can hear
clearly on the communication between Alice and Bob. For
simplicity, we set the bit streams that Alice and Bob send
as [0, 1, 0, 1··· ] and [1, 0, 1, 0··· ], respectively. According
to the analysis in section 5.1, we add guard bits to the bit
streams.
Ca = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0··· ]
Cb = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0··· ]

posed waveform of Alice and Bob.
We then make a rough synchronization for Alice and Bob
(there exists a small out of synchronization of about 0.5µs).
Fig. 22 shows the received RF envelop at Eve. For con-
venience, we temporarily do not take amplitude mismatch
into consideration. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that, due
to out of synchronization, Eve can separate Alice from Bob.
By assuming that Alice is ahead of Bob (opposite assump-
tion leads to a mirror symmetric result). Eve can tell that
when there is a peak in the middle of RF envelop, it is the
case that Alice sends 0 and Bob sends 1. When there is a
valley in the middle of RF envelop, it is the case that Alice
sends 1 and Bob sends 0.
To cover up the out of synchronization, we add a random
shaking (−1µs to 1µs in the experiment) on both Alice and
Bob. Fig. 23 shows a snapshot of the received RF envelop
at Eve. It can be seen from the ﬁgure that, due to shaking,
a peak is turned into a valley. If Eve still uses the above
method to separate Alice and Bob, she will make a mistake.
7. RELATED WORK
Existing works [14, 3, 7, 12, 8] indicate that using sym-
metric key cryptography to secure the NFC is a practi-
cal solution to protect against many kinds of attacks.
It
is mentioned in [14] that due to the inherent protection
of NFC against Man-in-the-Middle-Attacks, standard key
agreement protocols like Diﬃe-Hellman based on RSA or El-
liptic Curves could be applied to establish symmetric keys.
Many works [5, 9] focus on ﬁnding the least expensive pro-
tocol for NFC and RFID. However, standard key agreement
protocols intrinsically have extensive computational over-
head and energy consumption. They are not preferable for
resource constrained NFC devices.
The works in [3, 7] proposed speciﬁc key agreements. The
idea is for both devices to send random bits at exactly the
same time. For the case when two parties send diﬀerent bits,
the attacker will not be able to identity which device sent
the 0 and which device sent the 1. However, this concept
is diﬃcult to be implemented in practice due to the strict
requirement of perfect synchronization as well as amplitude
and phase match. This issue has been discussed in detail in
this paper.
The works in [12, 8] proposed Physical layer key genera-
tion methods by using the wireless channel measurements.
By exploiting the reciprocal property of the wireless fad-
ing channel between two NFC devices, shared secret key
can be generated. The methods have low computational
overhead compared with standard key agreement protocols.
However, the key generation rate is low. The time interval
between two eﬀective measurements of channel randomness
is bounded by coherence time. Moreover, the methods have
multiple steps including advantage distillation, information
reconciliation and privacy ampliﬁcation, which add compu-
tation and transmission overhead and time consumption.
RIWA overcomes major problems in NFC key generation.
It is a practical, fast, energy-eﬃcient, and secure key agree-
ment scheme for resource constrained NFC devices.
8. CONCLUSION
We propose a practical and energy eﬃcient key agreement
method for duplex NFC. In the proposed method RIWA,
two users, Alice and Bob simultaneously send random bits
of 0 or 1. There are probabilities one of them sends 0 and
the other sends 1. An attacker only sees the superposed RF
signal cannot ﬁgure out which device sent the 0 and which
device sent the 1. Alice and Bob themselves know what
they have sent and can make use of the advantage to estab-
lish a secret key. RIWA also considers various inconsistency
which attackers may use to break the method: out of syn-
chronization, amplitude mismatch and phase mismatch. To
deal with inconsistency, RIWA introduces random shaking
on RF waveform and guard bits between consecutive ran-
dom bits. The shaking acts like random noise to cover up
the inconsistency. The guard bits prevent the attacker de-
termining the bit from the previous one.
Numerical simulations show that, with the existence of
out of synchronization, Eve’s BER is 42% on average with
ε/2γ0 = 10%. With the existence of amplitude mismatch,
Eve’s BER is 44% on average with α = 1.1, β0 = 0.4. With
the existence of phase mismatch, Eve’s BER is 48% on aver-
age with θ = 1◦, ϕ0 = 5◦. Since BERs are close to random
guesses, the result conﬁrms that Eve gains nearly no infor-
mation about the bits. Concept-proof experiments based on
software deﬁned radio demonstrate that, the shaking added
covers up the out of synchronization between Alice and Bob.
Eve, trying to use out of synchronization to crack the key,
will make mistakes. RIWA is a simple and convenient secu-
rity method with low energy and time consumption appli-
cable to low cost, resource-constrained NFC devices.
