### Percentiles of the Distance: An Intuitive Analysis

The relationship between percentiles and distance may initially seem counter-intuitive. However, there are specific reasons for this phenomenon, particularly in the context of smaller Autonomous Systems (ASes) and their name server infrastructure.

### Understanding the Counter-Intuitive Phenomenon

Smaller ASes often include small local ISPs that are more likely to "outsource" their name server infrastructure to other providers. This outsourcing is primarily driven by economic factors, as these ISPs may not want to own and operate their own name server infrastructure. Consequently, they opt for the less expensive option of using public resolvers such as Google Public DNS, OpenDNS, Level 3, UltraDNS, etc. This "outsourcing" of DNS services often results in LDNSes being non-local, leading to larger client-LDNS distances.

Another category of small ASes with large client-LDNS distances includes enterprises with geographically diverse branch offices. For operational convenience, these enterprises use a centralized name server infrastructure deployed in only one of their offices. Given the large client-LDNS distances, end-user mapping can significantly benefit a large fraction of clients in small ASes.

### Large ISPs and Their Name Server Infrastructure

Large ISPs typically operate their own name server infrastructures for their clients. These infrastructures often consist of LDNSes deployed in multiple geographically distributed locations. To direct clients to the "nearest" LDNS, the IP anycast mechanism is often used. This explains the smaller values of client-LDNS distance despite the large geographical area covered by these global ISPs. However, IP anycast has known limitations that can result in some clients being routed to faraway LDNS locations. Therefore, end-user mapping can also be beneficial for clients of large ISPs.

### Client Clusters and Their Radii

A client cluster is a set of clients that use the same LDNS. The Internet's clients can be partitioned into client clusters, with one cluster for each LDNS. The radius of a client cluster is defined as the mean distance of the clients in the cluster to the centroid of the cluster. In traditional NS-based mapping, a client cluster is the unit for making server assignment decisions, meaning all clients in a client cluster are assigned the same set of server IPs because they use the same LDNS.

If a client cluster of an LDNS has a small radius, i.e., the clients are close together, a more sophisticated form of NS-based mapping could still be effective, even if the client-LDNS distances are large. The mapping system could discover the client cluster and assign servers that provide good performance for the entire cluster. However, if the client cluster has a large radius, i.e., the clients are far away from each other, there may be no single server assignment for the entire cluster that is optimal for all clients. Thus, it is inherently difficult for NS-based mapping to perform well when the client cluster has a large radius, even with knowledge of client-LDNS pairings.

### Performance Impact of End-User Mapping

#### Deployment and Insights

We present our experience and insights from deploying end-user mapping for clients around the world in the first half of 2014. During this period, Akamai began the rollout of end-user mapping for clients who use public resolvers such as Google Public DNS and OpenDNS. The reasons for initially targeting clients who use public resolvers were twofold:

1. Based on our analysis of client-LDNS distances, we concluded that clients who use public resolvers are more likely to benefit from end-user mapping, as they tend to be farther away from their LDNSes and have large client cluster radii.
2. Public resolver providers such as Google Public DNS and OpenDNS support the EDNS0 client-subnet extension required for end-user mapping.

The end-user mapping rollout started on March 28th, 2014, and was completed on April 15th, 2014. We present insights based on performance measurements made before, during, and after the rollout.

#### Performance Metrics

The performance experienced by clients who download web content can be characterized in many different but complementary ways. We use the following four metrics measured from real-world clients downloading content from Akamai to evaluate the performance:

1. **Mapping Distance:** The great circle distance between a client and the server to which it was assigned by the mapping system. This is a purely geographical metric with no network-related component.
2. **Round Trip Time (RTT):** The TCP RTT measured from the server’s TCP stack. This is purely a network-related metric.
3. **Time to First Byte (TTFB):** The duration from when the client makes an HTTP request for the base web page to when the first byte of the requested web page is received by the client. This quantity is measured from the client’s browser and includes three components:
   - Time for the client’s request to reach the server.
   - Time for the server to construct the web page.
   - Time for the first chunk of the web page to reach the client.
4. **Content Download Time:** The duration from receiving the first byte of the page to completing the download of the rest of the web page, including the embedded content. This metric is also measured from the client’s browser.

#### High and Low Expectation Countries

To better understand the performance impact, we classify countries into two groups: a "high expectation" group where we expect end-user mapping to have a greater impact and a "low expectation" group where we expect the impact to be lower. Our client-LDNS analysis gives us an idea of what benefits to expect in which countries. Specifically, Figure 8 shows the proximity of clients to their LDNS for major countries. Using this analysis, we split the major countries into two halves. We define the high expectation group as those clients who reside in countries where the median distance to a public resolver is more than 1000 miles and the low expectation group as those whose median distance is under 1000 miles. We aggregate and present the performance metrics separately for these two groups, as we expect them to show different behaviors.

#### Collecting Performance Information

We collected performance metrics from a large and characteristic set of clients around the world before, during, and after the end-user mapping rollout. We used Akamai’s Real User Measurement (RUM) system for our client-side performance measurements. RUM inserts JavaScript into select web pages delivered by Akamai. The JavaScript runs inside the client’s browser when the page is downloaded by the client. The performance measurement is made using the industry-standard navigation timing and resource timing APIs. Using these APIs, the JavaScript running inside the client’s browser collects precise timing information when the page download is in progress, including when the DNS lookup started and completed, when the TCP connection was initiated, when the fetch request was sent out, when the first byte of the response was received, and when all the page content was fully downloaded. The timing measurements performed in client browsers around the world were sent to a backend cloud storage system and subsequently analyzed to produce the aggregate statistics we provide in this section.

#### Performance Analysis

1. **Mapping Distance:**
   - **High Expectation Group:** The mean mapping distance dropped from over 2000 miles on average to around 250 miles.
   - **Low Expectation Group:** The average mapping distance went from 400 miles to 200 miles.

2. **Round Trip Time (RTT):**
   - **High Expectation Group:** The average RTT dropped from 200ms to 100ms, a significant 50% decrease.
   - **Low Expectation Group:** The improvement was modest.

   - **Figure 16: CDFs of RTT**

3. **Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB):**
   - **High Expectation Group:** The mean TTFB decreased from around 1000 ms to 700 ms, a 30% improvement.
   - **Low Expectation Group:** The 75th percentile of the TTFB decreased from 1399 ms to 1072 ms for the high expectation countries and from 830 ms to 667 ms for the low expectation ones.

4. **Content Download Time:**
   - **High Expectation Group:** The content download time reduced from 300 ms to 150 ms, a 50% reduction.
   - **Low Expectation Group:** The improvement was small.

In summary, the deployment of end-user mapping significantly improved the performance metrics for clients, especially in high expectation countries, by reducing the mapping distance, RTT, TTFB, and content download time.
