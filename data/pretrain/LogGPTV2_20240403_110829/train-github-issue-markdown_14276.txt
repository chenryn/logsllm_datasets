Hello again,
As I was browsing the AbstractFormController source, I noticed what seemed to
be some duplication of code. It's quite possible this can be cleaned up a
small bit.
Inside handleRequestInternal, there is this logic:
if (isSessionForm()) {  
HttpSession session = request.getSession(false);  
if (session == null ||
session.getAttribute(getFormSessionAttributeName(request)) == null) {  
return handleInvalidSubmit(request, response);  
}  
}
Which is essentially duplicated in getCommand() of the same class.
I'd like to propose that getCommand() throw some error-specific exceptions
when the session doesn't exist, or when the form doesn't exist in the session.
This way, the code in handleRequestInternal can merely attempt a call to
getCommand() and see if there are exceptions like NoExistingSessionException.
If handleRequestInternal sees that exception, it can then forward the call to
handleInvalidSubmit().
At this point, the checking of the session and the checking if the form bean
is in the session is in two different places that are called twice in a row. I
think with just a bit of code moving, we can do the checking of the session
once.
Thanks!  
Seth
