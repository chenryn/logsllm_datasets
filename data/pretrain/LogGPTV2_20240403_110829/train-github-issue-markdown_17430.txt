Every time I open `app/assets/stylesheets/github/contributions.scss` the app
becomes unresponsive -- except I can Quit. No amount of waiting seems to allow
for it to right itself. I've opened the inspector before opening the file to
try to catch some hint of what's going on, but either the app becomes
unresponsive before reporting errors or nothing actually errors out.
_Note: This is accompanied with a CPU spike where the Atom Helper process is
consuming 100%._
Not sure if this is related to #150 as I am able to load large large files
from `vendor/assets` just fine.
