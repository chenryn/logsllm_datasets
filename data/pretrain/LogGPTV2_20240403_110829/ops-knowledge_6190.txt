### Problem Description
I am facing an issue while upgrading Python from version 2.4 to 2.6 on my CentOS 5 (Full) system. The original Python 2.4 installation is located in `/usr/lib/python2.4/`, with additional modules stored in `/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/`. I have successfully built Python 2.6 from source and installed it in `/usr/local/lib/python2.6/`. Additionally, I have set the default Python version to 2.6. However, this has resulted in the old modules for Python 2.4 being excluded from the `PYTHONPATH`, making them "lost." Specifically, the `yum` package is now broken, as it cannot find the `yum` module.

### Question
What is the correct approach to migrate or install these modules for use with Python 2.6?

### Solution
There are a few options to consider:

1. **Symbolic Links**:
   - If the existing modules are compatible with Python 2.6, you can create symbolic links from the Python 2.6 site-packages directory to the Python 2.4 site-packages directory. This will allow Python 2.6 to access the same modules.
   - Example command:
     ```bash
     ln -s /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/* /usr/local/lib/python2.6/site-packages/
     ```

2. **Re-Compilation**:
   - If the modules are not compatible with Python 2.6, you may need to re-compile them against the new Python version. Alternatively, you can install updated versions of the modules that are known to be compatible with Python 2.6.
   - Ensure that you are using Python 2.6 when running the setup script. For example:
     ```bash
     /usr/local/bin/python2.6 setup.py install
     ```

3. **Virtual Environments**:
   - Consider using virtual environments to manage different Python versions and their respective packages. Tools like `virtualenv` can help isolate the environments and avoid conflicts between different Python versions.
