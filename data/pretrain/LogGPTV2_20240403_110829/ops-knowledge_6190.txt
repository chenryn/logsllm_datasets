User: I have a problem of upgrading python from 2.4 to 2.6:
I have CentOS 5 (Full). It has python 2.4 living in /usr/lib/python2.4/ . Additional modules are living in /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/ . I've built python 2.6 from sources at /usr/local/lib/python2.6/  . I've set default python to python2.6 . Now old modules for 2.4 are out of pythonpath and are "lost". In particular, yum is broken ("no module named yum").
So what is the right way to migrate/install modules to python2.6?
Assistant: There are a couple of options...

If the modules will run under Python 2.6, you can simply create symbolic links to them from the 2.6 site-packages directory to the 2.4 site-packages directory.
If they will not run under 2.6, then you may need to re-compile them against 2.6, or install up-to-date versions of them.  Just make sure you are using 2.6 when calling "python setup.py"
