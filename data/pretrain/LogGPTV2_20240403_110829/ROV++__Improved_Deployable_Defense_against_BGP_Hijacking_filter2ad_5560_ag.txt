APPENDIX A
AUXILIARY PSEUDO-CODE IN ROV++
In Alg. 2, we present the pseudo-code of several procedures
in ROV++ that are not described in Section III-C. Let B denote
the set of blackholes that is set up at a router. Initially B is
empty. For a hole ∈ H, let hole.path denote the AS path in
the announcement. Similarly, for an announcement ann ∈ A,
let ann.path denote the AS path in the announcement.

Figures 13 and 14 show the results for the adopting and
non-adopting ASes, respectively, under subpreﬁx hijacks in
the category of top 100 ASes. Figures 15 and 16 show the
