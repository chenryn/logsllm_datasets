**Abstract:**
Mobile applications frequently encounter web URLs in various contexts, such as chatting and email reading. To provide a seamless user experience, many mobile apps incorporate in-app browsing interfaces (IABIs). While this approach enhances user-friendliness by avoiding constant switching between the app and the system browser, poorly designed IABIs can introduce significant usability security risks. This paper presents the first empirical study on the usability (in)security of IABIs in both Android and iOS apps. We collected a dataset of 23 high-profile mobile apps across five common categories, including Facebook and Gmail, and conducted a systematic analysis comprising eight carefully designed security tests. Our findings reveal that:
1. Approximately 30% of the tested apps do not provide sufficient URL information for users to make informed decisions.
2. Nearly all custom IABIs have issues with providing adequate security indicators, whereas IABIs based on Chrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController are generally secure.
3. Only a few IABIs warn users about the risks of entering passwords on potentially phishing login pages.

Despite acknowledging our findings, developers' willingness to address these usability security issues is low compared to fixing technical vulnerabilities. To mitigate these risks and guide future designs, we propose a set of secure IABI design principles.

**1. Introduction**
Mobile applications (apps) are integral to daily life, often requiring users to open external web URLs within their UIs. For instance, a user might need to open a URL received via a chat app like WhatsApp or embedded in an email in Gmail. To enhance user-friendliness, many high-profile apps implement in-app browsing interfaces (IABIs) instead of offloading the task to system browsers. However, if not well-designed, IABIs can introduce serious usability security issues. These interfaces often lack the comprehensive security features found in standalone browsers, such as full URL display and HTTP(S) indicators.

Motivated by these concerns, we conduct the first empirical study on the usability (in)security of IABIs in both Android and iOS apps. We analyze a dataset of 25 high-profile apps from five common categories: Chat, Social, Mail, Business, and News. Our systematic analysis includes eight carefully designed security tests covering the entire process of interacting with an in-app web page, from opening to navigating.

**2. Problem and Analysis**
We summarize the attack surfaces associated with IABIs and perform a systematic analysis using eight security tests. These tests evaluate the following aspects:
1. **URL Information Before Opening (T1):** Whether the app provides sufficient URL information for users to make informed decisions.
2. **Security Indicators After Loading (T2-T7):** Whether the IABI displays the URL, HTTPS indicator, HTTP warning, TLS error alerts, and defends against phishing attempts with fake HTTPS lock icons and long subdomains.
3. **Warnings During Navigation (T8):** Whether the IABI warns users about the risks of entering passwords on potentially phishing login forms.

**3. Measurement Results**
Our cross-platform analysis reveals the following key findings:
- **Incomplete URL Display:** About 30% of the tested apps do not display the complete URL, omitting the scheme (HTTP or HTTPS). Some apps, like Weibo and Quora, completely hide the URL.
- **Insufficient Security Indicators:** Most custom IABIs fail to provide adequate security indicators. In contrast, IABIs based on Chrome Custom Tabs and SFSafariViewController are generally secure.
- **Lack of Warnings:** Only a few IABIs, such as those in QQ and QQ Mail, provide specific warnings for dangerous operations, such as password input on login pages.

**4. Reporting and Defense**
To understand developers' reactions and provide recommendations, we issued security reports to all affected apps. Most developers acknowledged our findings, with some, like Instagram and LinkedIn, committing to fix the issues. However, overall, developers' willingness to address usability security issues is low compared to technical vulnerabilities. To help mitigate these risks and guide future designs, we propose a set of secure IABI design principles.

**5. Contributions**
This paper makes the following contributions:
- A comprehensive analysis of the attack surfaces and security tests for IABIs.
- Cross-platform measurement results and key security findings from testing 25 high-profile mobile apps.
- Recommendations and secure design principles for IABIs to enhance usability security.

**Figure 1: The Process of Opening a URL Within an App**
This figure illustrates three scenarios where a user might open a URL within an app: chatting with friends, posting on a social network, and reading or sending an email. When a user clicks on a URL (e.g., https://badssl.com), the app may use an in-app browsing interface to open it.
