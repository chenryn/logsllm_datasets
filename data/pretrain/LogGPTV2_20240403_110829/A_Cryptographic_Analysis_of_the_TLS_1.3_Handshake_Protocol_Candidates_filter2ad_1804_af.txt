### Agreement on `sid2` Implies Agreement on the Respective Partner’s Identity

1. **Session Identifiers are Distinct for Different Stages:**
   This is inherently true because session identifiers monotonically increase with each stage.

2. **At Most Two Sessions Have the Same Session Identifier at Any Stage:**
   The session identifier includes the group element for the Diffie-Hellman key and a random nonce from both the initiator and the responder. For three sessions to have the same session identifier, the third session would need to pick the same group element and nonce as one of the other two sessions. The probability of such a collision can be bounded by \( n_s \cdot \frac{1}{q} \cdot 2^{-|\text{nonce}|} \), where \( n_s \) is the maximum number of sessions, \( q \) is the group order, and \( |\text{nonce}| = 256 \) bits.

### Theorem 5.2: Multi-Stage Security of Draft-05

**Statement:**
The draft-05 full handshake is Multi-Stage-secure in a key-independent and stage-1-forward-secret manner with concurrent authentication properties \( \text{AUTH} = \{(unauth, unauth, unauth), (unauth, unilateral, unilateral), (unauth, mutual, mutual)\} \). Formally, for any efficient adversary \( A \) against the Multi-Stage security, there exist efficient algorithms \( B_1, \ldots, B_7 \) such that:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{Multi-Stage},D}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq 3n_s \cdot \left( \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-ODH}}^{H,B_1} + n_u \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{EUF-CMA}}^{\text{Sig},B_2} + n_u \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{EUF-CMA}}^{\text{Sig},B_3} + \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{PRF},B_4} + \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{PRF},B_5} + \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{PRF},B_6} + \text{Adv}_{\text{PRF-sec}}^{\text{PRF},B_7} \right)
\]

where \( n_s \) is the maximum number of sessions and \( n_u \) is the maximum number of users.

**Running Time:**
If we attribute the running time of the original security game to \( A \), then the running times of algorithms \( B_1, \ldots, B_7 \) are essentially identical to that of \( A \). This is because these adversaries merely simulate \( A \)'s original attack with some additional administrative steps.

### Proof

**Single Test Query:**
First, consider the case where the adversary makes a single Test query. This reduces its advantage by a factor of at most \( \frac{1}{3n_s} \) due to the three stages in each of the \( n_s \) sessions.

**Session Identifier Recovery:**
The main challenge is that the session identifiers \( \text{sid2} \) for the second stages (and hence also \( \text{sid3} \)) are not available in clear but are partly encrypted. However, if we have the first-stage session key (handshake traffic key), we can recover the identifier. Session-key independence and further arguments about avoiding losing conditions allow us to reveal this key without compromising the security of the second- and third-stage keys. Detailed hybrid arguments are provided in Appendix A.

**Subsequent Security Analysis:**
We separately consider three disjoint cases for the tested session:
- **Case A:** The adversary tests a client session without an honest contributive partner in the first stage.
- **Case B:** The adversary tests a server session without an honest contributive partner in the first stage.
- **Case C:** The tested session has an honest contributive partner in the first stage.

This allows us to bound the advantage as:

\[
\text{Adv}_{\text{Multi-Stage},D}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq 3n_s \cdot \left( \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{client without partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{server without partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{test with partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \right)
\]

### Case A: Test Client without Partner

**Initial Game (Game A.0):**
This initial game equals the Multi-Stage game with a single Test query where the adversary is restricted to test a client (initiator) session without an honest contributive partner in the first stage. Therefore:

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{A.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} = \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{client without partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A}
\]

**Game A.1:**
In this game, the challenger aborts if any two honest sessions compute the same hash value for different inputs in any evaluation of the hash function \( H \). Let \( \text{abort}_H \) denote this event. We can bound the probability \( \Pr[\text{abort}_H] \) by the advantage \( \text{Adv}_{\text{COLL}}^{H,B_1} \) of an adversary \( B_1 \) against the collision resistance of \( H \).

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{A.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq \text{Adv}_{G_{A.1}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + \text{Adv}_{\text{COLL}}^{H,B_1}
\]

**Game A.2:**
In this game, the challenger aborts if the tested client session receives a valid signature under the public key \( \text{pk}_U \) of some user \( U \in U \) such that the hash value has not been signed by any of the honest sessions. Let \( \text{abort}_{\text{Sig}} \) denote this event. We bound the probability \( \Pr[\text{abort}_{\text{Sig}}] \) by the advantage \( \text{Adv}_{\text{EUF-CMA}}^{\text{Sig},B_2} \) of an adversary \( B_2 \) against the EUF-CMA security of the signature scheme.

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{A.1}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq \text{Adv}_{G_{A.2}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + n_u \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{EUF-CMA}}^{\text{Sig},B_2}
\]

**Final Bound:**
If Game A.2 does not abort, the tested client and an honest session agree on \( \text{sid1} \), so they are partnered in the first stage. Thus:

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{A.2}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq 0
\]

### Case B: Test Server without Partner

**Initial Game (Game B.0):**
This initial game equals the Multi-Stage game with a single Test query where the adversary is restricted to test a responder session without an honest contributive partner in the first stage.

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{B.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{server without partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A}
\]

**Game B.1:**
Similar to Case A, this game aborts if any two honest sessions compute the same hash value for different inputs in any evaluation of \( H \). We can bound the probability \( \Pr[\text{abort}_H] \) by the advantage \( \text{Adv}_{\text{COLL}}^{H,B_3} \) of an adversary \( B_3 \).

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{B.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq \text{Adv}_{G_{B.1}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + \text{Adv}_{\text{COLL}}^{H,B_3}
\]

**Game B.2:**
This game aborts if the tested server session receives a valid signature under some public key \( \text{pk}_U \) without an honest session outputting this signature. We bound the probability \( \Pr[\text{abort}_{\text{Sig}}] \) by the EUF-CMA security of the signature scheme.

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{B.1}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq \text{Adv}_{G_{B.2}}^{\text{draft-05},A} + n_u \cdot \text{Adv}_{\text{EUF-CMA}}^{\text{Sig},B_4}
\]

**Final Bound:**
If Game B.2 does not abort, the tested server and an honest session agree on \( \text{sid1} \), so they are partnered in the first stage. Thus:

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{B.2}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq 0
\]

### Case C: Test with Partner

**Initial Game (Game C.0):**
This initial game equals the Multi-Stage game with a single Test query, but restricting the adversary to only test a session having an honest contributive partner in the first stage.

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{C.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} = \text{Adv}_{1-\text{Multi-Stage},\text{test with partner}}^{\text{draft-05},A}
\]

**Game C.1:**
Guess a session label \( \text{label0} \neq \text{label} \) (among the at most \( n_s \) sessions) and abort the game if this session is not the honest contributive partner in the first stage. This reduces the adversary’s advantage by a factor of at most \( \frac{1}{n_s} \).

\[
\text{Adv}_{G_{C.0}}^{\text{draft-05},A} \leq n_s \cdot \text{Adv}_{G_{C.1}}^{\text{draft-05},A}
\]

**Game C.2:**
Encode a Diffie-Hellman challenge in the shares \( g^x \) and \( g^y \) at the tested session. If a client session is tested, the partnered session \( \text{label0} \) guessed in Game C.1 holds the same shares. If a server session is tested, the partnered session \( \text{label0} \) holds the same shares.
