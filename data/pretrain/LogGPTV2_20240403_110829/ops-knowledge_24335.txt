Assistant: This log chunk shows the kernel generating cores at various times between 2005-06-30 08:36:14 and 2005-07-01 02:23:28. The cores generated are 16483, 257, 18751, 22783, 8021, 10734, 3613, 1916, 4246, 7777, 5935, 8691, 5512, 1123, 1641, and 1165. Additionally, there are two CE sym entries at 0x1b858ca0 and 0x1b858280, and one error creating a node map from a file.
