# Summary of the new feature/enhancement
I would like to be able to maximize windows to span across multiple monitors
and not just carve up each monitor with its own zones.
# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)
Ideally it would be great if I get just click the maximize button and have the
window maximize to more than 1 screen,  
For me I have 3 screens but I only want to have 2 screens linked to be 1
virtual big screen.
It would be great if we could create a virtual screen linking more than one
monitor and then be able to carve that up into zones.
