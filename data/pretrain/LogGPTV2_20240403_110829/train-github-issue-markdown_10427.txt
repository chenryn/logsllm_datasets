We need a way to export macros from modules and import them in other modules.
Currently we either prepend a string of macro definitions to every file, such
as with `debug!`, `error!`, etc., or we just copy and paste the macros we
need. This second approach leads to code duplication and lots of subtly
different implementations.
As a temporary workaround, we could probably use `include!`.
