ABSTRACT
In 2011, Adblock Plus—the most widely-used ad blocking software—
began to permit some advertisements as part of their Acceptable
Ads program. Under this program, some ad networks and content
providers pay to have their advertisements shown to users. Such
practices have been controversial among both users and publishers.
In a step towards informing the discussion about these practices,
we present the ﬁrst comprehensive study of the Acceptable Ads
program. Speciﬁcally, we characterize which advertisements are
allowed and how the whitelisting has changed since its introduction
in 2011. We show that the list of ﬁlters used to whitelist acceptable
advertisements has been updated on average every 1.5 days and grew
from 9 ﬁlters in 2011 to over 5,900 in the Spring of 2015. More
broadly, the current whitelist triggers ﬁlters on 59% of the top 5,000
websites. Our measurements also show that the program allows
advertisements on 2.6 million parked domains. Lastly, we take the
lessons learned from our analysis and suggest ways to improve the
transparency of the whitelisting process.

INTRODUCTION
Over 144 million users employ ad blocking software [27]. Users
are motivated by a desire to hide intrusive ads, increase their privacy,
or protect themselves from malicious adverts [34]. Yet, some claim
ad blocking threatens the Web’s business model. Indeed, Google lost
an estimated $887 million in revenue to blocking in Q2 2013 [26,31].
In 2011 Eyeo GmbH—the maker of the most popular ad blocker,
Adblock Plus—introduced their Acceptable Ads program. Through
this program, Adblock Plus allows some “non-intrusive” ads that
satisfy a set of community-driven guidelines, such as “ads should
never obscure page content.” According to Eyeo, their goal is to

strike a balance between the needs of users and publishers, and
they emphasize transparency as key to the program’s success [6,
22]. However, Eyeo drew strong criticism when they conﬁrmed
some companies—including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—paid
undisclosed amounts to be included in the whitelist [9,32]. Some
view this arrangement as a conﬂict of interest; the organization that
provides blocking software is in a position to indirectly proﬁt from
ads being shown.
The Acceptable Ads program impacts millions of users and bil-
lions of dollars,1 but little is known about the whitelisting process
or how it impacts users. In this paper, we provide the ﬁrst compre-
hensive study of the Acceptable Ads program. We identify how the
users experience the Web under this program by exploring the use
of ad policies (called ﬁlter lists, or just whitelists). We develop tools
and techniques to explore and correlate information from Internet
measurements, a complete history of the program’s whitelist, instru-
mented browser behavior, and user surveys. In this, we have focused
on the following questions:
1. What is in the whitelist and how has it changed over time?
We ﬁnd that at the current revision, Rev. 988, the whitelist
contains 5,936 ﬁlters and is updated every 1.5 days to add or
modify 11.4 ﬁlters on average.
2. Who beneﬁts from the whitelist? We ﬁnd that the whitelist
identiﬁes 3,545 unique explicitly listed publisher domains
(including 15 of the top 100), and that ﬁve general-purpose
ﬁlter types are responsible for allowing content on 2,676,165
parked domains.
3. How do we measure the impact of the whitelist? We survey
whitelist use in the Alexa top 5,000 most popular websites
as well as 5,000 sites from the 5k to 1 million most popular.
The current whitelist triggers ﬁlters on 59% of the top 5,000
websites but explicitly whitelist only a few percent of less
popular sites.
4. How do users perceive acceptable advertisements? A survey
of over 300 users showed wide dissension on many adver-
tisements that were judged as being invasive. One area of
agreement was clear: advertisements interspersed with and
largely indistinguishable from web content were deemed as
undesirable.
Our study is motivated by other large-scale Web and security
measurement studies, including those characterizing SPAM [14,
17], afﬁliate programs [20], domain abuse [4,7], and malicious
advertising [19,34]. We begin by detailing the operation of Adblock

lion in U.S. advertising revenue for Q3 2014, breaking the previous
record of $12.1 billion in Q4 of 2013 [13].

Plus and the Acceptable Ads program. We then characterize how
the program works in practice. Finally, we offer suggestions for
improving the transparency of the whitelisting process.
2. ADBLOCK PLUS
Adblock Plus is the most widely used browser extension with over
50 million users across all major browsers.2 In 2014, the extension’s
Firefox version was downloaded 68 million times and boasted 19.2
million users daily.3 Adblock Plus is open source and available free
of charge.
Adblock Plus was created by Michael McDonald’s as a fork
of Henrik Aasted Sørensen’s Adblock project. In January 2006,
Wladimir Palant rewrote the code and released it as a separate
project for Firefox. Since then, Adblock Plus has been ported to
run on all major browsers: Chrome (Dec. 2010 [28], formerly
AdThwart [3]), Opera (Nov. 2012 [10]), Internet Explorer (Aug.
2013 [29]), and Safari (Jan. 2014 [25]). Eyeo offers an Android
version, but it is not available in the Google Play store [30].
Adblock Plus uses textually encoded ﬁlters to determine the con-
tent shown on a page. Blocking ﬁlters restrict page content, while
exception ﬁlters override any matching blocking ﬁlters to allow the
content. Filter deﬁnitions generally consist of: (i) a matching ex-
pression that speciﬁes what content to block (or allow), e.g., the
URL of an advertising network; and (ii) a set of ﬁlter options, e.g.,
the image option applies the ﬁlter to image requests. A detailed
description of the ﬁlter syntax is included in Appendix A.
Adblock Plus users rarely write their own ﬁlters. Instead, they
subscribe to regularly published text-based ﬁlter lists. By default,
Adblock Plus subscribes users to two ﬁlter lists: the ﬁrst, EasyList,
contains tens of thousands of ﬁlters to block advertisements and
covers most common ad networks. Other blocking extensions also
use EasyList, including the second most popular blocker, AdBlock.
The second default ﬁlterlist—which we refer to as the Acceptable
Ads whitelist—is used to implement the Acceptable Ads program.
In short, this list overrides the user’s other ﬁlter lists allowing certain
publishers to show advertisments. We characterize the scope and
impact of the whitelist in later sections.
Users can subscribe to additional ﬁlter lists that provide function-
ality beyond blocking advertisements including: disabling tracking,
allowing the user to “browse the web truly anonymously”, blocking
known malicious domains, and removing social media buttons, such
as the Facebook Like button.4 We defer analysis of these lists to
future work.
2.1 Filter Matching
Broadly, individual ﬁlters match one of two types of content: Web
requests or page elements. We brieﬂy describe each below.
2.1.1 Matching Web Requests
Publishers often rely on third-party ad networks, such as Adzerk
or Google Adsense, to display advertisements on their site. These

Figure 2: Acceptable ads on Reddit.com. Reddit is a member of the
Acceptable Ads program. Consequently, Adblock Plus allows both of the ads
on this page. A third-party network, Adzerk, serves the ad on the right side
(labeled 1). The sponsored link (labeled 2) is embedded directly into the
page.
networks make it possible for publishers to show ads by simply
including a small snippet of code provided by the ad network. This
straightforward interface also simpliﬁes the blocking process by
allowing a single ﬁlter to block ads on multiple sites.
For example, reddit.com uses the code in Figure 1 to show
Adzerk advertisements. When an Adblock Plus user visits the page,
their browser will make a third-party web request to fetch the adver-
tisement from Adzerk. Adblock Plus will preempt this request to
check if the request URL matches any ﬁlters. If the match is for a
blocking ﬁlter, such as the following, Adblock Plus will cancel the
request, stopping the browser from fetching the ad.

|| adzerk . net ^ $third - party
In short, the above ﬁlter will block all third-party requests to adzerk.
net or any of its subdomains. For a more complete explanation of
ﬁlter syntax see Appendix A.
If the request matches an exception ﬁlter,5 then Adblock Plus al-
lows it, regardless of any blocking ﬁlter matches. The advertisement
is then shown as an image on the right of the page—denoted by the
bold 1 in Figure 2.
2.1.2 Matching Page Elements
Adblock Plus uses different ﬁlter syntax for matching advertising
elements embedded directly into the page. Similar to how request
ﬁlters match URLs, element ﬁlters use CSS Selectors6 to identify
elements based on attributes such as the element’s class or id.
The following ﬁlter blocks the “sponsored link” at the top of
Reddit’s front page (bold 2 in Figure 2) by matching elements with
an id attribute of siteTable_organic.
1
reddit . com ### siteTable_organic
However, Adblock Plus does not block either of the advertise-
ments in our example. It allows these ads because Reddit is a part
of the Acceptable Ads program.

Figure 3: The growth of the Acceptable Ads whitelist. The whitelist has grown steadily since its introduction in 2011. On average, this ﬁlter list is updated
every 1.5 days, adding or modifying 11.4 exception ﬁlters. The most recent version (Rev. 988 on April 28, 2015) includes 5,936 ﬁlters. Among these are exceptions
for domain parking services, conversions tracking, and third-party ad networks.
3. ACCEPTABLE ADS
In May 2011, Adblock Plus’s creator, Wladimir Palant, outlined
the criteria for Acceptable Ads with the goal of “encourag[ing]
websites to use advertising that users don’t perceive as annoying.”7
These guidelines have been reﬁned multiple times based on feedback
from the community. Whitelisted sites are required to adhere to
these guidelines. To paraphrase the most recent criteria [1], sites
must ensure that:
1. Advertisements cannot contain animations, sounds, or “attention-
grabbing” images.
2. Advertisements cannot obscure page content or obstruct read-
ing ﬂow, i.e., the ad cannot be placed in the middle of a block
of text.
3. Advertisements must be clearly distinguished from the page
content and must be labeled using the word “advertisement”
or equivalent terms.
4. Banner advertisements should not force the user to scroll
down to view page content.
After publishing the initial Acceptable Ads requirements, Palant
and his partner, Till Faida, created Eyeo GmbH in August 2011.
Their goal was to make the Adblock Plus project “more sustain-
able” [8]. The following month, the company began surveying users
about their willingness to allow advertising in some form.8 By the
year’s end released Acceptable Ads as an opt-out feature in Adblock
Plus version 2.0.9
The program has been controversial. Eyeo drew criticism from
both users and publishers when they conﬁrmed that some companies—
including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon—paid undisclosed amounts
to be included in the whitelist [9,32]. Eyeo has stated that received
funds are used to sustain the program. Further, they state that
whitelisting is free for smaller sites and all participants of the pro-
gram must abide by the acceptable ads criteria.

Eyeo’s practices have incensed some publishers to such a degree
that they have accused the company of “extortion” and “shaking
down” websites [23]. Recently, this criticism has escalated to the
courtroom, and Eyeo is facing lawsuits in France and Germany [11,
12,16]. In Germany, publishers ﬁled suit against Eyeo claiming
that their product is anti-competitive and threatens their ability to
generate revenue. The regional court in Hamburg ruled in favor of
Eyeo after a four month trial [15,33].
3.1 Filter List Maintenance
Eyeo regularly updates the whitelist. On average, the company
adds or modiﬁes 11.4 ﬁlters every 1.5 days, and has a documented
process for requesting new whitelist ﬁlters to be added. The process
of adding new sites to the Acceptable Ads program comprises four
steps: contact, application, agreement, and inclusion.
The ﬁrst step, contact, consists of communication between Eyeo
and a perspective publisher. Either party may initiate this dialog [24].
Next, Eyeo works with the publisher to ensure their site follows
the Acceptable Ads guidelines (the application step). Once Eyeo
conﬁrms the site’s advertisements adhere to their policy, they estab-
lish a private agreement with the publisher. These agreements may
involve a fee, but Eyeo does not currently disclose the fee structure,
monetary value, or list of paying publishers. However, anecdotal
sources claim the company has requested up to 30% of recovered
revenue [5], and Eyeo acknowledges they have experimented with
both ﬂat and performance-based fees [24]. After reaching an agree-
ment, Adblock Plus adds the ﬁlter to the list and solicits community
feedback on the application via an online forum.10 Forum posts
made after Nov. 2014 include links to the whitelist revision and
optional sample screenshots.
4. WHITELIST ANALYSIS
In the following sections, we examine the complete history of
Eyeo’s Acceptable Ads program. Our analysis combines whitelist
changes with public disclosures and empirical observations of browser
behavior. We focus on answering the following broad questions.

Table 1: Yearly activity for the Acceptable Ads whitelist. This table shows the year, number of revisions, number of ﬁrst-party domains, and number of
changes to exception ﬁlters—modiﬁcations are counted as new ﬁlters. The data covers changes up to Apr. 28, 2015 (Rev. 988).
1. How has the whitelist changed over time? We analyze all
revisions of the whitelist to quantify the number of domains
and ﬁlters. Section 4.1.
2. Who beneﬁts explicitly from the whitelist? We ﬁrst char-
acterize the whitelist ﬁlters based on their scope and target
content. Then, we parse the whitelist ﬁlters to extract explic-
itly listed publisher domains and group these domains based
on popularity and category. Section 4.2.
3. How do we measure the impact of the whitelist? We run
an automated survey across the top 5,000 most popular web-
sites and 5,000 additional sites from the 5K to 1M top sites.
Section 5.
4. How do users perceive acceptable advertisements? We survey
305 users on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform and ask
them to rate 15 “acceptable” advertisements. Section 6
4.1 Whitelist History
Eyeo tracks all whitelist changes in a public Mercurial repos-
itory.11 Using this repository, we extracted 988 versions of the
whitelist dating from the start of the whitelist in Oct. 2011 to Apr.
2015. The most recent version (Rev. 988) comprises 5,936 distinct
ﬁlters. The majority of these exceptions allow advertisements and
other advertising functionality such as conversion tracking.
Figure 3 shows the growth of the Acceptable Ads whitelist over
time. There are two large jumps visible in the ﬁgure. The ﬁrst
corresponds to Google’s ofﬁcial addition to the whitelist on June
21, 2013 (Rev. 200).12 In total, this revision added 1,262 ﬁlters for
Google search advertisements on google.com and other variations
of this URL, e.g., google.co.uk. The second jump was caused
by ﬁlters for ask.com, about.com, and related subdomains, e.g.,
cars.about.com. These additions are discussed in Section 7.
Table 1 summarizes the yearly changes. The second full year of
the whitelist (2013) saw the list grow by an order of magnitude over
the previous year: Eyeo made 4,633 ﬁlter changes, bringing the total
to 2,319 publisher domains compared to just 60 domains in 2012.
However, as we discuss below, these numbers belie the actual scope
of the whitelist.
4.2 Whitelist Scope
In order to understand who beneﬁts from the Acceptable Ads
program, we need to ﬁrst understand the scope of a whitelist ﬁlter,
i.e., the set of domains that can activate the ﬁlter. For some ﬁlters,
this list of applicable domains is explicitly enumerated in the ﬁlter’s
deﬁnition. We call these restricted ﬁlters. For others—namely
unrestricted and sitekey ﬁlters—the ﬁlter can apply to any domain.
The implication here is that it is impossible to determine the actual
impact of these ﬁlters using ﬁlter deﬁnitions alone. Instead, we can
only empirically estimate this value through site surveys (Section 5).

Figure 4: Hierarchy of Filter Types in the Whitelist.
Figure 4 illustrates a hierarchy of whitelist ﬁlter types and their
scope. We discuss each class in detail below.
4.2.1 Restricted Exception Filters
A restricted exception ﬁlter explicitly deﬁnes the ﬁrst-party do-
mains for which it activates, i.e., the ﬁlter will only match when the
user is browsing a page on one of these domains. The syntax for
deﬁning the domain list depends on the ﬁlter’s type. For example,
the following are two of the whitelist’s restricted exceptions for
reddit.com.
1
2
reddit . com # @ ## ad_main
@@ || adzerk . net / reddit / $subdocument ,
document , domain = reddit . com
The ﬁrst ﬁlter—an element exception—instructs Adblock Plus to
allow any reddit.com elements with the ad_main identiﬁer. For
element ﬁlters, restricted domains are prepended to the start. The
second ﬁlter allows requests to adzerk.net, the ad provider for
reddit.com. In this case, the ﬁlter is restricted via the domain
option.
Restricted exception ﬁlters make up 89% of the whitelist and
