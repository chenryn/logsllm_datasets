Question: "You are analyzing the security of a DNS system and considering the potential impacts of on-path and off-path attackers. Given the following scenarios, select the outcomes that are consistent with the nature of DNS security challenges as described in the context of DNS cache behavior and attacker capabilities."
 "A": "An on-path attacker can intercept DNS requests and respond with malicious records that will be cached if their response arrives first, regardless of the TTL value."
 "B": "An off-path attacker can frequently attempt to inject malicious DNS responses, as the caching behavior of DNS does not restrict the number of tries an attacker has."
 "C": "An off-path attacker's chances of successfully injecting a malicious DNS response are limited due to the need to guess the ID field and the caching of legitimate responses."
 "D": "On-path attackers can only read DNS requests but cannot send spoofed responses due to the secure nature of the DNS protocol."
