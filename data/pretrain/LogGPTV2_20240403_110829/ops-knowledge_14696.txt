User: I have some .py files I wrote that I want to run on a different machine.  The target machine does not have python installed, and I can't 'install' it by policy.  What I can do is copy files over, run my stuff, and then remove them.
What I tried was to just take my development python folder over to the target machine and cd to the python folder and run python.exe /path/to/.py/file.  It gave me an error saying that python.dll was not registered.  If I registered the DLL that is probably going to move me to far across the 'violating policy' line.
Is there anyway I can accomplish running python files on a machine that does not have python actually installed (trying to get py2exe to work now, but it is painful)?
Assistant: This is an old question, but one alternative is creating a virtual environment for Python, which can be as simple as python -m venv myenvname (Python 3.4). You can "install" packages into it the normal way (e.g. pip) without needing anything else. You'll end up with a folder you can move/delete at your leisure.
