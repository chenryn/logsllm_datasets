Abstract—Location information is critical to a wide variety
of navigation and tracking applications. GPS, today’s de-facto
outdoor localization system has been shown to be vulnerable to
signal spooﬁng attacks. Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) are
emerging as a popular complementary system, especially in road
transportation systems as they enable improved navigation and
tracking as well as offer resilience to wireless signals spooﬁng
and jamming attacks. In this paper, we evaluate the security
guarantees of INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation for road
transportation systems. We consider an adversary required to
travel from a source location to a destination and monitored by
an INS-aided GPS system. The goal of the adversary is to travel to
alternate locations without being detected. We develop and eval-
uate algorithms that achieve this goal, providing the adversary
signiﬁcant latitude. Our algorithms build a graph model for a
given road network and enable us to derive potential destinations
an attacker can reach without raising alarms even with the
INS-aided GPS tracking and navigation system. The algorithms
render the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors useless as they
generate road trajectories indistinguishable from plausible paths
(both in terms of turn angles and roads curvature). We also
design, build and demonstrate that the magnetometer can be
actively spoofed using a combination of carefully controlled coils.
To experimentally demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of the
attack in real-world, we implement a ﬁrst real-time integrated
GPS/INS spoofer that accounts for trafﬁc ﬂuidity, congestion,
lights, and dynamically generates corresponding spooﬁng signals.
Furthermore, we evaluate our attack on ten different cities using
driving traces and publicly available city plans. Our evaluations
show that it is possible for an attacker to reach destinations
that are as far as 30 km away from the actual destination
without being detected. We also show that it is possible for
the adversary to reach almost 60–80% of possible points within
the target region in some cities. Such results are only a lower-
bound, as an adversary can adjust our parameters to spend more
resources (e.g., time) on the target source/destination than we
did for our performance evaluations of thousands of paths. We
propose countermeasures that limit an attacker’s ability, without
the need for any hardware modiﬁcations. Our system can be used
as the foundation for countering such attacks, both detecting and
recommending paths that are difﬁcult to spoof.
I. INTRODUCTION
The ability to track one’s location is important to a wide
variety of safety- and security-critical applications. For exam-
ple, logistics and supply chain management companies [1], [2],
[3] that handle high-value commodities (e.g., currency notes)
continuously monitor the locations of every vehicle in their
ﬂeet carrying valuables to ensure their secure transportation to
the intended destination. Law enforcement ofﬁcials use ankle
bracelets [4], [5] to monitor the location of defendants or
parole and notify them if the offender strays outside an allowed
area. Ride-hailing applications such as Uber and Lyft use
location information for tracking, billing, and assigning drivers
to trips. Furthermore, the locations of public transport [6], [7],
[8] are continuously monitored to ensure smooth and timely
operation of services. With the advent of autonomous vehicles
and transport systems, the dependence on location information
is only bound to increase. The majority of above applications
rely on GPS [9], the de facto outdoor localization system in
use today. It is estimated that more than 8 billion GNSS1
devices [10] will be in use by the year 2020.
However,
it has been widely demonstrated that GPS is
vulnerable to signal spooﬁng attacks. One of the main reasons
is the lack of any form of signal authentication. It is today
possible to change the course of a ship [11], force a drone to
land in a hostile area [12] or fake the current location in a road
navigation system [13] by simply spooﬁng GPS signals. The
increasing availability of low-cost radio hardware platforms
make it feasible to execute such attacks with less than few
hundred dollars worth of equipment. There has been several
evidences of jamming and spooﬁng reported in the media.
For example, as quoted in Gizmodo [14] “Because the toll-
taking for commercial trucks relies on GPS tracking, they can
avoid paying through jamming. If a $45 device made your
daily commute free, you too might be tempted to commit a
federal crime.” Another report [15] mentions “Gary Bojczak
admitted buying an illegal GPS jammer to thwart the tracking
device in his company vehicle”. Several cryptographic [16],
[17], [18], [19] and non-cryptographic [20], [21], [22], [23],
[24], [25], [26] countermeasures have been proposed to detect
or mitigate signal spooﬁng attacks. These techniques are either
unreliable (e.g., large number of false alarms), effective only
against naive attackers or require modiﬁcations to the GPS re-
ceiver/infrastructure. Alternate localization technologies using
Wi-Fi or Cellular [27], [28] lack the accuracy and coverage
required for the mentioned applications, consume signiﬁcant
amount of power and are susceptible to interference.
Inertial navigation i.e., the use of sensors such as accelerom-
eter, gyroscope and compass to navigate during temporary
GPS outages have been around for decades, speciﬁcally in
aircrafts, spacecrafts and military vehicles [29], [30], [31].
The advancements in sensor manufacturing technologies have
resulted in widespread integration of these sensors into many
commonly used devices such as smart phones, tablets, ﬁtness
trackers and other wearables. Many vehicle tracking and au-

tomotive navigation systems have integrated GPS with inertial
measurement units to improve localization and tracking of
individual vehicles [32], [33], [34], [35]. Inertial sensors are
key to the balancing and navigation technologies present in
modern segways. Low-cost inertial sensors have also prolif-
erated into the consumer drone industry today. One of the
key advantages of inertial navigation is its robustness and
resilience to any form of wireless signal spooﬁng and jamming
attacks as there is no need for the sensors to communicate or
receive information from any external entity such as satellites
or other terrestrial transponders. This makes them very attrac-
tive for use in security- and safety-critical localization and
tracking applications where GPS (or any wireless) spooﬁng
and jamming attacks are a concern. The main drawback
of inertial navigation units is the accumulating error of the
sensor measurements. These accumulated sensor measurement
errors affect the estimated position and velocity over a longer
duration of time and hence limit the maximum period an
inertial unit can act independently. This affects aerial and
maritime navigation capabilities signiﬁcantly as the tracked
vehicle has all the six degrees of freedom to move. However,
in the context of road navigation, the vehicle is limited by the
road network and can only navigate within the constraints of
these existing roadways. These inherent constraints imposed
by the road networks have made low-cost inertial sensors very
valuable for quick attack detection and immediate tracking of
cheating entities [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41].
In this work, we evaluate the security guarantees of
GPS/INS based on-road location tracking systems. Specif-
ically, we address the following research questions: Given
a geographic area’s road network and assuming that both
GPS and inertial sensor data are continuously monitored for
tracking an entity’s location, is it possible for an attacker to
fake his navigation path or ﬁnal destination? If yes, what are
the attacker’s constraints and possibilities? Can we exploit the
physical motion constraints that exist in an urban road network
and design a secure navigation algorithm that generates travel
routes that are hard to spoof? For example, can a driver of a
vehicle carrying high-value commodities (e.g., currency notes)
spoof his assigned route and deviate without detection by the
monitoring center? Can a parole with GPS/INS ankle monitor
spoof his location and travel routes without detection?
We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate
that it is indeed possible for an attacker to hijack vehicles far
away from the intended destination or take an alternate route
without triggering any alarms even though the GPS location
as well as inertial sensors are continuously monitored. We
develop a suite of algorithms which we refer to as ESCAPE
that leverage the regular patterns that exist in urban road
networks and automatically suggests potential alternate escape
routes while spooﬁng the assigned route with start point s, and
end point d. Spooﬁng means that the adversary will travel on
an alternate path indistinguishable from the spoofed (assigned)
path. Our ESCAPE suite of algorithms accounts for intersec-
tions turn angles, roads curvatures, and magnetometer bearings
to calculate the escape routes an attacker can take without
detection while spooﬁng. We implement a real-time integrated
GPS/INS spoofer that can dynamically generate spooﬁng
signals depending on the current trafﬁc ﬂuidity, trafﬁc lights,
and any unexpected congestion the attacker might encounter
while driving the escape path. We note that our prototype is,
to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst integrated GPS/INS
spooﬁng system that can, in real-time, dynamically adjust
the spooﬁng signals based on the true conditions. We further
evaluated our attack’s performance using open source city
plans and driving traces in ten major cities across the globe.
Our simulation results show that an attacker can potentially
take the vehicle as far as 30 km before the monitoring system
can detect a potential attack. We also drove on ten different
paths of varying lengths using our real-time integrated spoofer
and our results show that the attacker can hijack the vehicle to
more than 2 km (the average deviation for our city), without
once losing a GPS lock and with a maximum delay of 60ms
between the real and spoofed paths. Note that even after
detection, the tracking system has no knowledge of the true
location. Our attack affects several services and applications
with effective monetary value running into several millions
of dollars. Our attacks essentially renders the gyroscope and
accelerometer useless by generating paths acceptable to the
monitoring system, but have a signature indistinguishable
from the trajectory effectively traveled by the adversary. For
the magnetometer, a sensor that can play a critical role in
detecting the incongruence of the claimed trajectory with the
measured heading, we built and demonstrated the effectiveness
of a magnetometer-spooﬁng device that physically generate a
magnetic ﬁeld compatible with the spoofed trajectory. Finally,
we turn around our ESCAPE suite of attack algorithms to build
a countermeasure that the tracking services can run to mitigate
such spooﬁng attacks. Speciﬁcally, we modiﬁed ESCAPE to
output secure navigation routes that can be assigned given a
start and end point that limit the attacker’s possibilities.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Overview of GPS
GPS is today the de-facto outdoor localization system used.
GPS consists of more than 24 satellites orbiting the earth. Each
satellite is equipped with high-precision atomic clocks and
transmits messages referred to as the navigation messages that
are spread using pseudorandom codes unique to that satellite.
The GPS receiver on the ground receives these navigation
messages and estimates their time of arrival. Based on the
time of transmission contained within the navigation message
and its time of arrival, the receiver computes its distance to
each of the visible satellites. Once the receiver acquires the
navigation messages from at least four satellites, the GPS
receiver estimates its own location and precise time.
B. GPS Spooﬁng Attacks
Civilian GPS is easily vulnerable to signal spooﬁng attacks
due to the lack of any signal authentication and the publicly
known spreading codes for each satellite, modulation schemes,

and data structure. A GPS signal spooﬁng attack is a physical-
layer attack in which an attacker transmits specially crafted
radio signals that are identical to authentic satellite signals.
In a signal spooﬁng attack, the objective of an attacker may
be to force a target receiver to (i) compute a false geographic
location, (ii) compute a false time or (iii) disrupt the receiver
by transmitting unexpected data. Today, with the increasing
availability of low-cost radio hardware platforms [42], [43]
and open source GPS signal generation software [44], it is
feasible to execute GPS spooﬁng attacks with less than $100
of equipment. GPS signal generators can be programmed to
transmit radio frequency signals corresponding to a static posi-
tion (e.g., latitude, longitude and elevation), or simulate entire
trajectories. For example, an attacker can spoof the navigation
route of a vehicle carrying high-value items and hijack it to
arbitrary locations without raising alarms. The operators of
ride hailing services can fake the route taken. Furthermore,
GPS spooﬁng attacks can delay or even prevent emergency
support services from reaching intended destinations.
C. Inertial Sensors Aided Navigation and Tracking
The need to operate effectively in scenarios where GPS
is inaccessible, unreliable or potentially jammed or spoofed
by adversaries has led to the increased interest in building
complementary navigation solutions and spooﬁng detection
techniques. Several countermeasures and alternative localiza-
tion techniques have been proposed. Of them, inertial sensors
are emerging as a popular choice for two main reasons. First,
inertial measurements are not affected by wireless jamming
and are therefore resilient to denial of service attacks. Second,
their widespread availability in majority of modern smart-
phones makes them easy to deploy and integrate into existing
navigation and tracking infrastructure without the need any
hardware or software modiﬁcations to the GPS receiver.
Inertial navigation is the process of integrating the readings
of select sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
magnetometer into a complete three-dimensional position,
velocity, and orientation solution. Inertial navigation systems
are classiﬁed as dead-reckoning, since the estimation process
is iterative and uses prior information i.e., calculating from
some previously known navigation solution. Accelerometers
measure both gravitational and non-gravitational acceleration
along each of the three axes. The gyroscopes measure the rate
at which an object is rotating, and are used to compute the
attitude and heading of the object. The gyroscope measure-
ments aid the accelerometer in ﬁguring out the orientation of
the object. Typically, sets of three accelerometers and three
gyroscopes, both orthogonally aligned, are combined into a
single inertial measurement unit (IMU). The setup commonly
contains additional analog and digital circuitry,
including
conversion and calibration components. The magnetometer
measures the magnetic ﬁelds and thus determines the cardinal
direction to which the object is pointing.
the errors propagate and affect
One of the main drawbacks of low-cost inertial sensors
(e.g., MEMS [45]) is that the process of dead reckoning in
general, results in a build-up of errors over the course of the
measurement. Since the position, velocity, and attitude updates
are products of single or double integration of raw inertial
sensor readings,
the ﬁnal
position, velocity and attitude estimates. For example, due to
the single integration performed on angular rate measurements,
a constant gyroscope bias will produce a linearly growing
angular error, the gyro noise will produce a ‘random walk’
growing with the square root of time. The double integration
required to transform the accelerometer output to position
produces a quadratically growing position error and a second-
order ‘random walk’, for a constant accelerometer bias and
−1
white noise respectively. In numerical terms, a 25 μm2s
accelerometer bias (≈ 245 μg) of a navigation grade sensor
would produce a 1.59 km position error in one hour. The
aggravation of sensor errors becomes critical to aviation and
maritime applications as the vehicles have more degrees of
freedom to move. However, on road, the vehicles are limited
by the available road networks and are therefore severely
constrained in their possible trajectories. Figure 1 illustrates
how the bias errors affect the ﬁnal position estimates in a
road navigation scenario (with motion constraints) and aerial
(without any motion constraints). These constraints imposed
inherently by the road networks has led to the emergence
of using inertial sensors to complement GPS navigation and
tracking solutions. Moreover, the inertial sensors are largely
immune to jamming which makes them invaluable to the safety
and security-critical applications described previously.
III. SPOOFING INS-AIDED LOCALIZATION SYSTEMS
In this section, we demonstrate spooﬁng attacks on road
navigation and tracking applications that rely on both GPS
and the inertial sensors for the localization. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst demonstration of spooﬁng attacks
on GPS/INS localization systems.
A. System and Attacker Model
Our attack is independent of how the GPS/INS system is
deployed i.e., it can either be an app on a trusted smartphone
or a specialized tracking device (e.g., ankle monitors) installed
on the entity of interest. The main objective of the monitoring
system is to keep track of the location and navigation routes of
the entities. We assume an attacker capable of generating and

transmitting fake GPS signals corresponding to any location
or navigation route of his choice using tools such as gps-sdr-
sim [44]. The goal of the attacker is to spoof his location and
navigation trajectory without being detected. For example, the
attacker can try to deviate from an assigned navigation route
and reach as far away as possible from the intended destination
before an anomaly is detected and an alarm raised. At that
moment, the adversary’s location remains undetermined. Al-
ternately, the attacker starts and ends at the intended locations,
however using a different route than the one being reported
to the monitoring station. We assume an attacker with full
physical access to the entity being tracked and is aware of
the GPS/INS system deployed for monitoring. For this work,
we assume that the tracking device itself is tamper-proof. For
example, the attacker can be a driver of a cargo company (or
a hijacker) who has full access to the vehicle. He regularly
drives this vehicle to transport high-value goods, and is aware
of the GPS and INS based tracking system employed by the
company. However, he cannot modify the software on the
smartphone or physically tamper the tracking device.
B. Overview of the Attack
The primary objective of the attacker is to fake the reported
navigation route without raising suspicion. Note that simply
spooﬁng GPS signals is not sufﬁcient as the INS measurements
will indicate discrepancies between the reported GPS location
and the inertial estimates. In order to successfully execute the
