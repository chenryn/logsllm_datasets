PM-11 MISSION AND BUSINESS PROCESS DEFINITION  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise’s mission and business processes should address 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. When addressing mission and business process definitions, 
the enterprise should ensure that C-SCRM activities are incorporated into the support processes for 
achieving mission success. For example, a system supporting a critical mission function that has been 
designed and implemented for easy removal and replacement should a component fail may require the use 
of somewhat unreliable hardware components. A C-SCRM activity may need to be defined to ensure that 
the supplier makes component spare parts readily available if a replacement is needed.

FAMILY: PERSONNEL SECURITY  
[FIPS 200] specifies the Personnel Security minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) ensure that individuals occupying positions of responsibility 
within organizations (including third-party service providers) are trustworthy and meet 
established security criteria for those positions; (ii) ensure that organizational 
information and information systems are protected during and after personnel actions 
such as terminations and transfers; and (iii) employ formal sanctions for personnel 
failing to comply with organizational security policies and procedures.  
Personnel who have access to an enterprise’s supply chain should be covered by the enterprise’s 
personnel security controls. These personnel include acquisition and contracting professionals, 
program managers, supply chain and logistics professionals, shipping and receiving staff, 
information technology professionals, quality professionals, mission and business owners, 
system owners, and information security engineers. Enterprises should also work with suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related 
service providers to ensure that they apply appropriate security controls to the personnel who 
interact with the enterprise’s supply chain, as appropriate. 
PS-1 
 POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: At each level, the personnel security policy and procedures and the 
related C-SCRM Strategy/Implementation Plan, C-SCRM Policies, and C-SCRM Plan(s) need to define the 
roles for the personnel who are engaged in the acquisition, management, and execution of supply chain 
security activities. These roles also need to state acquirer personnel responsibilities with regard to 
relationships with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers. Policies and procedures need to consider the full system development 
life cycle of systems and the roles and responsibilities needed to address the various supply chain 
infrastructure activities.  
Level 1: Applicable roles include risk executive, CIO, CISO, contracting, logistics, delivery/receiving, 
acquisition security, and other functions that provide supporting supply chain activities. 
Level 2: Applicable roles include program executive and individuals (e.g., non-federal employees, 
including contractors) within the acquirer enterprise who are responsible for program success (e.g., 
Program Manager and other individuals).  
Level 3: Applicable roles include system engineers or system security engineers throughout the operational 
system life cycle from requirements definition, development, test, deployment, maintenance, updates, 
replacements, delivery/receiving, and IT.  
Roles for the supplier, developer, system integrator, external system service provider, and other ICT/OT-
related service provider personnel responsible for the success of the program should be noted in an 
agreement between the acquirer and these parties (e.g., contract). 
The enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

PERSONNEL SCREENING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: To mitigate insider threat risk, personnel screening policies and 
procedures should be extended to any contractor personnel with authorized access to information systems, 
system components, or information system services. Continuous monitoring activities should be 
commensurate with the contractor’s level of access to sensitive, classified, or regulated information and 
should be consistent with broader enterprise policies. Screening requirements should be incorporated into 
agreements and flow down to sub-tier contractors. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
PS-6  
ACCESS AGREEMENTS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should define and document access agreements for all 
contractors or other external personnel who may need to access the enterprise’s data, systems, or network, 
whether physically or logically. Access agreements should state the appropriate level and method of access 
to the information system and supply chain network. Additionally, terms of access should be consistent 
with the enterprise’s information security policy and may need to specify additional restrictions, such as 
allowing access during specific timeframes, from specific locations, or only by personnel who have 
satisfied additional vetting requirements. The enterprise should deploy audit mechanisms to review, 
monitor, update, and track access by these parties in accordance with the access agreement. As personnel 
vary over time, the enterprise should implement a timely and rigorous personnel security update process for 
the access agreements.  
When information systems and network products and services are provided by an entity within the 
enterprise, there may be an existing access agreement in place. When such an agreement does not exist, it 
should be established. 
NOTE: While the audit mechanisms may be implemented in Level 3, the agreement process with required 
updates should be implemented at Level 2 as a part of program management activities. 
The enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
PS-7  
EXTERNAL PERSONNEL SECURITY 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Third-party personnel who have access to the enterprise’s information 
systems and networks must meet the same personnel security requirements as enterprise personnel. 
Examples of such third-party personnel can include the system integrator, developer, supplier, external 
service provider used for delivery, contractors or service providers who are using the ICT/OT systems, or 
supplier maintenance personnel brought in to address component technical issues not solvable by the 
enterprise or system integrator.

FAMILY: PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND 
TRANSPARENCY 
Personally identifiable information processing and transparency is a new control family 
developed specifically to address PII processing and transparency concerns.  
The enterprise should keep in mind that some suppliers have comprehensive security and privacy 
practices and systems that may go above and beyond the enterprise’s requirements. The 
enterprises should work with suppliers to understand the extent of their privacy practices and 
how they meet the enterprise’s needs. 
PT-1  
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that supply chain concerns are included in PII 
processing and transparency policies and procedures, as well as the related C-SCRM 
Strategy/Implementation Plan, C-SCRM Policies, and C-SCRM Plan. The policy can be included as part of 
the general security and privacy policy or can be represented by multiple policies. 
The procedures can be established for the security and privacy program in general and individual 
information systems. These policy and procedures should address the purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, 
management commitment, coordination among enterprise entities, and privacy compliance to support 
systems/components within information systems or the supply chain. 
Policies and procedures need to be in place to ensure that contracts state what PII data will be shared, 
which contractor personnel may have access to the PII, controls protecting PII, how long it can be kept, and 
what happens to it at the end of a contract. 
a. 
When working with a new supplier, ensure that the agreement includes the most recent set of 
applicable security requirements.   
b. Contractors need to abide by relevant laws and policies regarding information (PII and other sensitive 
information). 
c. 
The enterprise should require its prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

FAMILY: RISK ASSESSMENT 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Risk Assessment minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must periodically assess the risk to organizational operations (including 
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, and individuals, 
resulting from the operating of organizational information systems and the associated 
processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information.  
This document provides guidance for managing an enterprise’s cybersecurity risk in supply 
chains and expands this control to integrate assessments of cybersecurity risk in supply chains, 
as described in Section 2 and Appendix C. 
RA-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Risk assessments should be performed at the enterprise, 
mission/program, and operational levels. The system-level risk assessment should include both the supply 
chain infrastructure (e.g., development and testing environments and delivery systems) and the information 
system/components traversing the supply chain. System-level risk assessments significantly intersect with 
the SDLC and should complement the enterprise’s broader RMF activities, which take part during the 
SDLC. A criticality analysis will ensure that mission-critical functions and components are given higher 
priority due to their impact on the mission, if compromised. The policy should include supply chain-
relevant cybersecurity roles that are applicable to performing and coordinating risk assessments across the 
enterprise (see Section 2 for the listing and description of roles). Applicable roles within suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service 
providers should be defined.

SECURITY CATEGORIZATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Security categorization is critical to C-SCRM at Levels 1, 2, and 3. In 
addition to [FIPS 199] categorization, security categorization for C-SCRM should be based on the 
criticality analysis that is performed as part of the SDLC. See Section 2 and [NISTIR 8179] for a detailed 
description of criticality analysis. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
Related Controls: RA-9 
RA-3 
RISK ASSESSMENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Risk assessments should include an analysis of criticality, threats, 
vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact, as described in detail in Appendix C. The data to be reviewed and 
collected includes C-SCRM-specific roles, processes, and the results of system/component and services 
acquisitions, implementation, and integration. Risk assessments should be performed at Levels 1, 2, and 3. 
Risk assessments at higher levels should consist primarily of a synthesis of various risk assessments 
performed at lower levels and used for understanding the overall impact with the level (e.g., at the 
enterprise or mission/function levels). C-SCRM risk assessments should complement and inform risk 
assessments, which are performed as ongoing activities throughout the SDLC, and processes should be 
appropriately aligned with or integrated into ERM processes and governance.

VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Vulnerability monitoring should cover suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers in the 
enterprise’s supply chain. This includes employing data collection tools to maintain a continuous state of 
awareness about potential vulnerability to suppliers, as well as the information systems, system 
components, and raw inputs that they provide through the cybersecurity supply chain. Vulnerability 
monitoring activities should take place at all three levels of the enterprise. Scoping vulnerability monitoring 
activities requires enterprises to consider suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers. Enterprises, where 
applicable and appropriate, may consider providing customers with a Vulnerability Disclosure Report 
(VDR) to demonstrate proper and complete vulnerability assessments for components listed in SBOMs. 
The VDR should include the analysis and findings describing the impact (or lack of impact) that the 
reported vulnerability has on a component or product. The VDR should also contain information on plans 
to address the CVE. Enterprises should consider publishing the VDR within a secure portal available to 
customers and signing the VDR with a trusted, verifiable, private key that includes a timestamp indicating 
the date and time of the VDR signature and associated VDR. Enterprises should also consider establishing 
a separate notification channel for customers in cases where vulnerabilities arise that are not disclosed in 
the VDR. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s): 
VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING | BREADTH AND DEPTH OF COVERAGE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises that monitor the supply chain for vulnerabilities should 
express the breadth of monitoring based on the criticality and/or risk profile of the supplier or 
product/component and the depth of monitoring based on the level of the supply chain at which the 
monitoring takes place (e.g., sub-supplier). Where possible, a component inventory (e.g., hardware, 
software) may aid enterprises in capturing the breadth and depth of the products/components within 
their supply chain that may need to be monitored and scanned for vulnerabilities.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
VULNERABILITY MONITORING AND SCANNING | AUTOMATED TREND ANALYSIS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should track trends in vulnerabilities to components 
within the supply chain over time. This information may help enterprises develop procurement 
strategies that reduce risk exposure density within the supply chain.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
RA-7 
RISK RESPONSE  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should integrate capabilities to respond to cybersecurity 
risks throughout the supply chain into the enterprise’s overall response posture, ensuring that these 
responses are aligned to and fall within the boundaries of the enterprise’s tolerance for risk. Risk response 
should include consideration of risk response identification, evaluation of alternatives, and risk response
