- The data to be reviewed and collected includes C-SCRM-specific roles, processes, and the results of system/component and services acquisitions, implementation, and integration.
- Risk assessments should be performed at Levels 1, 2, and 3.
- Risk assessments at higher levels should consist primarily of a synthesis of various risk assessments performed at lower levels and used for understanding the overall impact with the level (e.g., at the enterprise or mission/function levels).
- C-SCRM risk assessments should complement and inform risk assessments, which are performed as ongoing activities throughout the SDLC, and processes should be appropriately aligned with or integrated into ERM processes and governance.

**Level(s): 1, 2, 3**

**Related Control(s): RA-3(1)**

#### RA-5: Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Vulnerability monitoring should cover suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers in the enterprise’s supply chain.
- This includes employing data collection tools to maintain a continuous state of awareness about potential vulnerability to suppliers, as well as the information systems, system components, and raw inputs that they provide through the cybersecurity supply chain.
- Vulnerability monitoring activities should take place at all three levels of the enterprise.
- Scoping vulnerability monitoring activities requires enterprises to consider suppliers as well as their sub-suppliers.
- Enterprises, where applicable and appropriate, may consider providing customers with a Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR) to demonstrate proper and complete vulnerability assessments for components listed in SBOMs.
- The VDR should include the analysis and findings describing the impact (or lack of impact) that the reported vulnerability has on a component or product.
- The VDR should also contain information on plans to address the CVE.
- Enterprises should consider publishing the VDR within a secure portal available to customers and signing the VDR with a trusted, verifiable, private key that includes a timestamp indicating the date and time of the VDR signature and associated VDR.
- Enterprises should also consider establishing a separate notification channel for customers in cases where vulnerabilities arise that are not disclosed in the VDR.
- Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.
- Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.

**Level(s): 2, 3**

**Control Enhancement(s):**

**Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning | Breadth and Depth of Coverage**
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Enterprises that monitor the supply chain for vulnerabilities should express the breadth of monitoring based on the criticality and/or risk profile of the supplier or product/component and the depth of monitoring based on the level of the supply chain at which the monitoring takes place (e.g., sub-supplier).
- Where possible, a component inventory (e.g., hardware, software) may aid enterprises in capturing the breadth and depth of the products/components within their supply chain that may need to be monitored and scanned for vulnerabilities.

**Level(s): 2, 3**

**Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning | Automated Trend Analysis**
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Enterprises should track trends in vulnerabilities to components within the supply chain over time.
- This information may help enterprises develop procurement strategies that reduce risk exposure density within the supply chain.

**Level(s): 2, 3**

#### RA-7: Risk Response
**Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance:**
- Enterprises should integrate capabilities to respond to cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain into the enterprise’s overall response posture, ensuring that these responses are aligned to and fall within the boundaries of the enterprise’s tolerance for risk.
