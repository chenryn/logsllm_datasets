So I have this in my app/config/routing.yml:  
acme_store_dev:  
resource: "@AcmeStoreBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"  
host: acme.{tld}  
requirements:  
tld: dev|org
and something like this in the bundles routing.yml:  
acme_store_homepage:  
pattern: /hello/{name}  
defaults: { _controller: AcmeStoreBundle:Default:index }  
acme_store_product:  
resource: "@AcmeStoreBundle/Resources/config/routing/product.yml"  
prefix: /product
and the product.yml contains several auto generated routes like that:  
product_show:  
pattern: /{id}/show  
defaults: { _controller: "AcmeStoreBundle:Product:show" }
The problem is within the first configuration. If I only use one host and no
tld matching (and any other form of regex matching in hosts) itll lead to this
kind of error:
An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template ("Some
mandatory parameters are missing ("tld") to generate a URL for route
"category_new".") in AcmeStoreBundle:Category:index.html.twig at line 36.
I could now start rewriting all that the crud generator made for me or stop
using that form of host matching, but Id really like to use those two features
- any suggestions? is this a bug that can be fixed? from what I understand the
/prefix is supposed to map route extensions dynamically, and independent of
any prior routes, which is also quite nifty to have.
