**Abstract:**
Preserving the availability and integrity of networked computing systems in the face of fast-spreading intrusions requires advances not only in detection algorithms but also in automated response techniques. In this paper, we propose a new approach to automated response called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE). Our engine employs a game-theoretic response strategy against adversaries modeled as opponents in a two-player Stackelberg stochastic game. RRE uses attack-response trees to analyze undesired security events and their countermeasures using Boolean logic to combine lower-level attack consequences. Additionally, RRE accounts for uncertainties in intrusion detection alert notifications. RRE then chooses optimal response actions by solving a partially observable competitive Markov decision process that is automatically derived from attack-response trees. Experimental results show that RRE, using Snort’s alerts, can protect large networks for which attack-response trees have more than 900 nodes.

**1. Introduction:**
The severity and number of intrusions on computer networks are rapidly increasing. Generally, incident-handling techniques are categorized into three broad classes. First, there are intrusion prevention methods that take action to prevent the occurrence of attacks, such as network flow encryption to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, there are intrusion detection systems (IDSes), such as Snort, which try to detect inappropriate, incorrect, or anomalous network activities, for example, by detecting malformed packet payloads to perceive Crash IIS attacks. Finally, there are intrusion response techniques that take responsive actions based on received IDS alerts to stop attacks before they can cause significant damage and ensure the safety of the computing environment.

So far, most research has focused on improving techniques for intrusion prevention and detection, while intrusion response usually remains a manual process performed by network administrators who are notified by IDS alerts and respond to the intrusions. This manual response process inevitably introduces some delay between notification and response, which could be easily exploited by the attacker to achieve their goal and significantly increase the damage. Therefore, to minimize the severity of attack damage resulting from delayed response, an automated intrusion response is required that provides instantaneous response to intrusion.

During the last five years, three types of techniques aimed at enhancing automation in the intrusion response have been proposed. The majority of these techniques are based on lookup tables filled with predefined mappings, e.g., (response actions, intrusion alerts). These methods allow response systems to deal with intrusions faster. However, they suffer from a lack of 1) flexibility, mainly because these systems completely ignore the intrusion cost factor; and 2) scalability, since it is infeasible to predict all the alert combinations from IDSes in a large-scale computer network.

A second group of intrusion response systems (IRSes) employs a dynamic rule-based selection procedure that selects response actions based on a certain attack metric, e.g., confidence or severity of attack. Finally, there has been increasing interest in developing cost-sensitive models of response selection. The main objective in applying such a model is to compare intrusion damage and response cost to ensure system recovery with minimum cost without sacrificing the normal functionality of the system under attack.

In this paper, we present an automated cost-sensitive intrusion response system called the Response and Recovery Engine (RRE) that models the security battle between itself and the attacker as a multi-step, sequential, hierarchical, non-zero-sum, two-player stochastic game. In each step of the game, RRE leverages a new extended attack tree structure, called the attack-response tree (ART), and the received IDS alerts to evaluate various security properties of the system. ARTs provide a formal way to describe system security based on possible intrusion and response scenarios for the attacker and response engine, respectively. More importantly, ARTs enable RRE to consider inherent uncertainties in alerts received from IDSes (i.e., false positive and false negative rates) when estimating the system’s security and deciding on response actions. Then, RRE automatically converts the attack-response trees into partially observable competitive Markov decision processes that are solved to find the optimal response action against the attacker, in the sense that the maximum discounted cumulative damage that the attacker can cause later in the game is minimized.

Using this game-theoretic approach, RRE adaptively adjusts its behavior according to the attacker’s possible future reactions, thus preventing the attacker from causing significant damage to the system by taking an intelligently-chosen sequence of actions. To deal with security issues with different granularities, RRE’s two-layer architecture consists of local engines, which reside in individual host computers.
