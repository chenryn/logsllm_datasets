### Corollary E.1: Security 3rd Model
Corollary E.1 states that to determine whether a source \( s \) is immune, doomed, or protectable in the security 3rd model, it is sufficient to track all the routes of the best type and shortest length for \( s \) (i.e., all routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \)). This is because \( s \) will always stabilize to one of these routes. 

- If all such routes are legitimate, \( s \) will stabilize to a legitimate route under any S*BGP deployment \( S \), making \( s \) immune.
- If all such routes are attacked, \( s \) will stabilize to an attacked route under any S*BGP deployment \( S \), making \( s \) doomed.
- If some of these routes are legitimate and some are attacked, the stabilization of \( s \) depends on the deployment \( S \), making \( s \) protectable.

### E.2 Computing Partitions: Security 2nd Model
The algorithm for determining partitions in the security 2nd model differs slightly from that used in the security 3rd model. We still use the algorithm from Appendix B.2, but with the following modifications:

- For every AS discovered during the BFS computation, we track all perceivable routes in its PR set that are of the same type as the routes in its BPR set.
- We classify ASes based on the nature of these routes:
  - **Immune**: All such routes lead to the destination.
  - **Doomed**: All such routes lead to the attacker.
  - **Protectable**: Some routes lead to the destination, and others lead to the attacker.

**Corollary E.2.** In the security 2nd routing model, for any destination \( d \), attacker \( m \), source \( s \), and deployment \( S \subseteq V \), \( s \) will stabilize to a route of the same type as any route in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \).

**Proof.** This follows from the correctness of our algorithm for computing routes in the security 2nd model (Appendix B.3). In this model, security is prioritized above route length but below route type. Therefore, all routes in \( BPR(s) \) must be contained in the set of routes in \( PR(s, m, d) \) that are of the same type as routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \).

- If \( s \) has customer routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \), it will be "fixed" to a route during either the FSCR or FCR subroutines of this algorithm for any choice of \( S \).
- If \( s \) has peer routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \), it will be "fixed" to a route in the FPeeR subroutine for any choice of \( S \).
- If \( s \) has provider routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \), it will be "fixed" to a route in either FSPrvR or FPrvR subroutines for any choice of \( S \).

Corollary E.2 tells us that to determine if \( s \) is immune, doomed, or protectable in the security 2nd model, it is sufficient to track all the routes of the best type of \( s \) (i.e., all \( s \)'s perceivable routes of the same type as routes in \( BPR(s, \emptyset, m, d) \)), because \( s \) is guaranteed to stabilize to one of these routes.

- If all such perceivable routes are legitimate, \( s \) must stabilize to a legitimate route under any S*BGP deployment \( S \), making \( s \) immune.
- If all such perceivable routes are attacked, \( s \) must stabilize to an attacked route under any S*BGP deployment \( S \), making \( s \) doomed.
- If some of these routes are legitimate and some are attacked, the stabilization of \( s \) depends on the deployment \( S \), making \( s \) protectable.

### E.3 Computing Partitions: Security 1st Model
In this paper, we assume that all source ASes are protectable in the security 1st model (see, e.g., Figure 3). However, there can be exceptional cases where ASes are either immune or doomed. We argue that the number of such ASes is negligible.

**Doomed ASes.** We can characterize doomed ASes as follows:

**Observation E.3.** In the security 1st model, for a particular destination-attacker pair \((d, m)\), a source AS \( v_i \) is doomed if and only if every one of its perceivable routes \( PR(v_i, m, d) \) contains \( m \).

- If every perceivable route from \( v_i \) to \( d \) contains \( m \), then no S*BGP deployment scenario can result in \( v_i \) being happy.
- If \( v_i \) is not doomed, there must be at least one S*BGP deployment scenario that results in \( v_i \) being happy, in which case \( v_i \) must select a route to \( d \) that does not contain \( m \).

ASes that are single-homed to the attacking AS \( m \) are certainly doomed, per Observation E.4. There are 11,953 and 11,585 single-homed stub ASes (without peers) for the relevant datasets.
