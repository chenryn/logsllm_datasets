User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Work folders not working I am trying to configure work folders on W2012 R2.

I completed server configuration (as described in all procedures) and I have no error in server logs.



Port 443 is in use by "windows sync share" service (if I stop this service the port is not in use anymore; so...)

I cannot use auto discovery because one of the domain controllers is still 2008R2, so I am configuring the clients using the direct url and this error is shown:



On this server I have those roles installed:


IIS (with one FTP site)
WSUS with HTTP port 81 and HTTPS 8350)
HyperV (not used, only as backup)
WDS
File server with DFSR

Assistant: ok! figured it out!

You have to create a certificate, also if all computers are connecting from the same domain (and they are trusted).

Just create a certificate (official authority or self-signed) and register it on server using command:

netsh http add sslcert ipport=&lt;IP address&gt;:443 certhash=&lt;Cert thumbprint&gt; appid={CE66697B-3AA0-49D1-BDBD-A25C8359FD5D} certstorename=MY


Then install it on clients in root certificate container.

I Also had to install GA update 2 on server.
