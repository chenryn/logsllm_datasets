User:  In database design, how to ensure data consistency? Please provide the corresponding method.
Assistant: 1. Well-designed data model: When designing a data model, it is necessary to follow norms and standards to ensure the correctness and integrity of the data model. For example, you should use the same data type for the same type of data to avoid storing the same information repeatedly. 2. Application transaction: A transaction refers to a set of database operations that must be completed or not completed at all, and partial completion is not allowed. When executing a set of operations, if any one of them fails, the entire transaction will fail and be automatically rolled back to ensure data consistency. 3. Use unique index: A unique index is a database constraint that can uniquely identify data in a table. Using a unique index can avoid the existence of duplicate data, thereby ensuring data consistency. 4. Using Views: Views are virtual tables that can retrieve data from one or more tables. Views can be used to logically organize and filter data to ensure data consistency. 5. Use triggers: A trigger is an automated program that monitors database operations and executes related operations automatically. Using triggers can automatically update related data when data changes to ensure data consistency. 6. Use data verification: Data verification refers to verifying data when entering or updating data to ensure that the data meets the requirements. For example, the length, data type, and data format of the data can be limited to ensure the correctness and consistency of the data.
