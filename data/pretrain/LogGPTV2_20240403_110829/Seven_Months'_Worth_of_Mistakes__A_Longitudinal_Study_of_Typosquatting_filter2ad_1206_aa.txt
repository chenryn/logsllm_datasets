## Abstract
Typosquatting is the practice of registering domain names that are slight misspellings of popular domain names. This concept has been known and studied for over 15 years but remains a prevalent issue. Previous studies have either provided a snapshot of the typosquatting landscape or relied on domain registration data for longitudinal analysis. In this paper, we present the first content-based, longitudinal study of typosquatting. We collected data on typosquatting domains targeting the 500 most popular websites over a seven-month period. Our findings reveal that, despite 95% of popular domains being targeted by typosquatters, few trademark owners proactively register their own typosquatting domains for protection. Additionally, we observe that typosquatting domains frequently change ownership between typosquatters and legitimate entities, and that typosquatters vary their monetization strategies over time. Our study also highlights that a significant portion of typosquatting domains can be traced back to a small group of hosters and that certain top-level domains (TLDs) are more prone to typosquatting than others.

## 1. Introduction
Domain names and the Domain Name System (DNS) are fundamental technologies that have enabled the modern web to grow to its current scale. Although users increasingly rely on search engines to find content, domain names remain crucial. The introduction of new TLDs, such as .xxx, .guru, and .email, by ICANN aims to provide more relevant and available domain names in an overcrowded namespace.

The importance of domain names has not gone unnoticed by unscrupulous individuals seeking to profit at the expense of others. In the 1990s, domain squatting emerged, where individuals registered trademarks and brand names with the intent to sell them back to the rightful owners at a premium. Typosquatting, a variant of domain squatting, involves registering misspelled versions of popular domain names to capture mistyped traffic. For example, a typosquatter might register vacebook.com to intercept users who mistype facebook.com. In May 2013, Facebook was awarded $2.8 million in damages and over 100 typosquatting domains due to such abuse [22].

Previous research on typosquatting has primarily focused on snapshots of the landscape or domain registration data, without examining changes in content over time. In this study, we present the first content-based, longitudinal analysis of typosquatting. Over a seven-month period, we collected over 900 GB of data by visiting the typosquatting domains targeting the 500 most popular websites daily. This extensive dataset allows us to measure typosquatting at scale and investigate temporal changes in typosquatting domains.

Our key findings include:
- Despite 95% of popular domains being targeted, most do not use defensive registrations.
- A large fraction of possible typosquatting domains for short, popular authoritative domains is already registered, leading typosquatters to target longer domains.
- Typosquatters frequently switch monetization strategies and monitor expiring domain registrations.
- Approximately 50% of all typosquatting domains can be traced back to just four typosquatting page hosters.
- Differences in domain pricing and dispute resolution procedures across TLDs significantly impact the prevalence of typosquatting.

## 2. Background

### 2.1. Typosquatting Models
The most common typosquatting domains are those with a Damerau-Levenshtein distance of one from a popular domain, resulting from a single character insertion, deletion, substitution, or adjacent character permutation. Based on Wang et al.'s categorization [25], we consider the following five typosquatting models for our study:
1. **Missing-dot typos**: e.g., wwwexample.com
2. **Character-omission typos**: e.g., www.exmple.com
3. **Character-permutation typos**: e.g., www.examlpe.com
4. **Character-substitution typos**: e.g., www.ezample.com (where "x" is replaced by the adjacent "z" on a QWERTY keyboard)
5. **Character-duplication typos**: e.g., www.exaample.com

We limit our study to these models and single-typo domains, as they are more likely to be typed by users.

### 2.2. Data Gathering
To conduct our longitudinal study, we set up two automated crawlers using the Alexa top 500 domains as input. The first crawler generates typosquatting domains based on the aforementioned models and checks if each domain resolves to an IP address. If it does, the crawler uses PhantomJS to visit the webpage, waits for 10 seconds to allow dynamic content to load, and saves the IP address, final URL, HTML body, and a screenshot to disk. This process was repeated daily for seven months, starting April 1, 2013, and ending October 31, 2013. A second machine was used for redundancy. To prevent excessive resource usage and minimize the risk of being blocked, duplicate typosquatting domains were filtered out, and the crawl rate was optimized. In total, 28,179 potential typosquatting domains were generated, with 17,172 resolving to an IP address at least once during the study.

The second crawler performed weekly WHOIS lookups for all successfully resolved domains, parsing and saving the responses. The slower weekly interval was necessary to comply with WHOIS server policies.

### 2.3. Analysis
Our crawlers collected over 900 GB of data, including 3,389,137 web pages and 424,278 distinct WHOIS records. To analyze this data, we classified the collected pages into categories listed in Table I, distinguishing between legitimate, malicious, and undetermined uses. We used perceptual and locality-sensitive hashing to cluster pages based on visual appearance rather than domain-specific properties. Using the aHash and Nilsimsa algorithms, we grouped the 3,389,137 pages into 8,102 clusters.

After initial clustering, we manually reviewed and categorized the clusters to ensure accuracy.

## 3. Results
Our results provide new insights into the typosquatting landscape. We verify that previously identified trends still hold and offer additional findings based on both static and longitudinal data. We show that strict policies and easy dispute-resolution procedures can reduce typosquatting abuse.

## 4. Related Work
Previous studies have focused on snapshots of typosquatting activity or domain registration data. Our study is the first to provide a content-based, longitudinal analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.

## 5. Conclusion
In this paper, we present the first content-based, longitudinal study of typosquatting. Our findings highlight the ongoing prevalence of typosquatting and the need for more effective protective measures. We provide new insights into the behavior of typosquatters and the factors that influence the typosquatting landscape.
