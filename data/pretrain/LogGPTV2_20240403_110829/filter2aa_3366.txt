Disclaimers 
These views are mine, not my employer’s, 
my publisher’s, my cat’s etc.   
I DO LIKE OPEN DATA!  I just want to see 
it done right. 
Some of the vulnerabilities shown have 
been fixed/changed/modified.  They are 
still instructive as cautionary tales. 
More results will appear in a forthcoming 
book from OR Books and on my blog

The Six Ws of Open Data 
What is Open Data? 
Who has Open Data? 
Why is Open Data? 
Where is Open Data?  
When is Open Data?  
Worrisome aspects of Open Data 
What is the Open Data 
Movement? 
Initiative by many governments to make their 
data openly available 
Driven by: 
 Calls for transparency (“it’s the taxpayers money”) 
 Sincere desire for innovation (“they’ll come up with 
some great uses for our data at that Hackathon”) 
 Fear (“Wikileaks is going to get this anyway; it looks 
better if we release it”) 
 Cheapness (“we don’t have to pay the developers”) 
 Positive sentiments about open source, 
transparency, “data wants to be free” 
Some notable examples 
NYC Datamine 
Philadelphia OpenDataPhilly 
Open Data Framework (Vancouver, 
Edmonton, Toronto and Ottawa) 
Open Data Challenge (EU) 
Direct input systems like seeclickfix.com 
NYC Datamine 
On October 6, 2009 NYC released, with 
great fanfare, 103 municipal data sets 
One listed 1100 women’s organizations in 
the city 
Release contained their private email 
address, secret question like “favorite pet” 
and answer like “fluffy” 
Problem #1:  Neglecting to read and redact data sets 
before releasing! 
Toronto’s 311 Customer 
Requests System 
25% are about garbage/recycling pickup 
Some are serious, personal etc. 
Location is supposed to be reported as 
partial postal code  e.g. M4Vxxx,  but e.g.  
WOLFE AVE & DANFORTH RD 
If there are enough of these slip ups, 
combined with Google maps, etc. they can 
tell a story… 
Problem #2:  Sloppy, lazy data entry 
See.  Click.  Fix.  Shame. 
Problem #3.  Malice.  Aforethought. 
When you offer a 20,000 € 
prize, things happen!

Who Won?

Who Wouldn’t Agree with Such 
a Wonderful Application?  
A little technical aside 
This thing runs off multiple open databases 
all maintained by the Slovak government 
The Fair-Play Alliance has read only access 
How are they supposed to “take down 
specific data” that they don’t control? 
Fair-Play Alliance has appealed the ruling 
and is still in operation. 
Problem #4:  Laws, policies and judges lag behind 
technology 
Of Course, Election Results 
Should be Open Data (right?) 
Did My Wife Vote for Me? 
Problem #5: Inference from Small Numbers 
Philadelphia’s 
OpenDataPhilly.org  
Includes Campaign Finance Records, 
which are generally required to be 
disclosed.   
“Results are freely viewable and printable 
but not available for download” and “empty 
searches take too long” 
It wasn’t long until I had me some .csv files 
to play with 
What We Can Learn 
Full “home” address provided.  Tied to tax 
receipt so probably chosen with care 
I’m not sure what percentage of people try 
to protect their address, but in the US 
‘Nationally, 27.6% of households have 
unlisted (telephone) numbers. In many 
cities the unlisted rate is over 50%.’

tips/general-research-tips/the-science-of-sampling-telephone-samples/ 
 People often pay for privacy, need it for 
personal for business, reasons, etc.    
Campaign Finance Disclosure 
Rules Date Back to 1970s 
US Federal Elections Commission files go 
back to 1980.  Just a reminder of what we 
had for data mining technology back then:

There are some rather 
interesting addresses in the file 
Hmm, is that THE Ron Rivest? 
Search for Smith in 2010 
Political Contribution Records 
Why Include Address?  
Laziness?  Disambiguation? 
The donor files for 2010 were downloaded 
from OpenDataPhilly as .CSV files, 
imported into Microsoft Excel and sorted 
by the contributor name field.   
“Potential Duplicates” were defined as 
additional names that were shown 
identically as a name in the database, but 
with a different address. 
Results from most common US 
names 
Name Number of Entries  
“Dups” 
Smith 
588  
8 
Johnson 
426  
3 
Williams  
400  
4 
Conclusion:  Having home address didn’t do a lot of good 
in resolving possible duplicates. 
Are those addresses real home 
addresses? 
A significant number of contributors 
(86/588 of Smith, 63/426 of Johnson, 
77/400 of Williams) listed the same 
address, 1719 Spring Garden Street, 
Philadelphia, PA., 19130.   
Viewing this location on Google Maps 
Streetview shows that it is the office of the 
I.B.E.W. Electricians Union.  
Problemas ? 
#6   Under-estimating the desire and ability of 
someone to torture the database for info 
#7   Inconsistent data. Providing contributor’s 
“address” is a legal requirement but some 
people use non-home, e.g. union office 
#8   The “why” e.g. of requiring “address” 
needs to be re-examined in the light of new 
“hows” -- tools like mapping APIs, big data, 
jigsawing of public and private databases 
This is an old (6 years ago) jigsawing  experiment I did… 
Some things have gotten better, many have gotten worse!

Now “addressed” by a combination of data 
changes, technical and legal safeguards 
Problem #9:  “Data Jigsawing” of public and 
private databases

Problem #10: Your face is your newest privacy risk 
as facial recognition goes mainstream.

Provocative Question:  Should 
the Rich Have Less Privacy? 
People who run companies that get 
contracts, give contributions (especially 
large ones) have money 
In the US there is some sentiment that the 
SNAP Food Stamp program is abused 
In theory we could post that Ms. X bought 
junk food (allowed) and attempted  to buy 
beer with her food stamps...but we don’t. 
Indirect Risks of Government 
Disclosure 
You can’t get it back.  Companies like 
ChoicePoint Systems (now part of 
Lexis/Nexis) are grabbing and storing it 
New technologies (think DNA matching) 
“Genetic Genealogy” 
Ancestry.com 
14 years of operation 
6,000,000,000 records, mostly from public 
sources 
20,000,000 family trees 
Or try the mobile service 
Problem #11:  Information about DNA is getting into our 
hands (e.g. from 23andme.com) and where else? 
Beware of Time Traveling 
Robots from the Future 
Tools 
An inquiring mind 
A motive (financial, ID theft, journalism, 
whistle blowing) 
Scripting languages 
ScraperWiki, collection of Ruby, Python, 
PHP scripts and plenty of ideas 
SQL Lite and other databases 
Hackathons 
Problem #12:  Data collected now, and in the past, can will 
be analyzed, cross-referenced, etc. in the future 
Even if it’s always been public, 
now it’s “super-public” 
Data that used to be public but buried in a 
dusty courtroom basement 
Now instantly available, searchable, storable 
“if it happened in the past ten years, it might 
be online.  If it happened in the past five 
years, it’s probably online. And if it happened 
in the past two years, it’s almost certainly 
online.”

The Dirty Dozen (and growing) 
Inadvertent disclosure 
Sloppy data entry 
Malicious misinformation 
Law/Policy lag 
Inference from Small Numbers 
Assuming nobody will torture data 
The Dirty Dozen (and growing) 
Inconsistent data 
Ignoring new tools like mapping, visualization 
Data jigsawing 
Facial recognition 
Powerful data like genetic info in hands of 
the consumer 
Retroactive analysis with better tools, 
databases, etc. 
Some recommendations 
-Scan files carefully for direct PII that may be included; 
-Consider ways in which PII may be revealed indirectly; 
-Act promptly to remove database that are shown to reveal PII, 
and retain clear legal rights to do so; 
-Anticipate the cross-correlation of government data with other 
databases, public and private; 
-Provide a convenient mechanism for users to express privacy 
concerns and follow up;  
-Sponsor hackathons before the data is released to try to 
foresee unanticipated uses; 
-Negotiate strong privacy protection on data provided to the 
private sector;
