### Description
One of the main things we want to know is task durations.
The main way I know how to get this is to hover over the `Gannt` chart or use
the `Task Duration` chart.
It would be nice to have the data that is in the `Gannt` chart or the `Task
Duration` chat in a table view.
### Use case/motivation
That plots are making the data harder to find than a table alone.
