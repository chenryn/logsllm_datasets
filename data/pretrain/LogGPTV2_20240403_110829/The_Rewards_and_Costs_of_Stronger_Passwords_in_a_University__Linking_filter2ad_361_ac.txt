is shown in Figures 3 and 4. In the full period studied,
more users (66%) had to reset their password than not –
on average, a user had to reset their password 1.08 times.
Users may have to reset their passwords for two reasons:
if they have forgotten their original password, or if their
password has expired. The cost of a reset is signiﬁcantly
higher than a change, as it requires either physical pres-
ence at the institution’s help desk or using a phone-based
reset system. Over the period studied, the mean number
of password changes and resets per user is 3.5. This is
investigated further in Section 4.3.

words by number of password resets. After 100 days
the weakest passwords expire and users choose stronger
passwords, which accounts for the steep rise. This pat-
tern repeats after another 100 days. At 350 days users
change their previously strongest passwords to one that
is as strong or weaker password, causing a pronounced
dip in the average password expiration.
There is a strong positive correlation between each
user’s previous password strength and the likelihood of
that same user resetting their password before expira-
tion (i.e., forgetting the password, Spearman’s ρ = 0.95,
p < 10−15). A user with a password lifetime of more
than 300 days is four times as likely to forget their pass-
word than a user with a password with a 100 day lifetime.
The minimum reset frequency per day of actual pass-
word lifetime is achieved with passwords which have a
100 day lifetime. Most resets however occur shortly after
passwords have been set, and not after a user has been us-
ing a password for 100 days. Having a relatively strong
password on the system then incurs the additional cost
of potentially needing to reset that password. This may
not only negate the advantages of having a strong pass-
word in the ﬁrst place, but results like these can also in-
form predictive helpdesk/support provisioning [36], i.e.,
if users are encouraged to maintain stronger passwords,
they may require more helpdesk support to reset pass-
words.
This is in contrast with Figure 4: The more pass-
word resets a user will have had, the weaker their pass-
word choice. While the average password lifetime of all
groups is increasing as the users renew their password,
the division between users with 0 or 1 reset and users
with more resets remains pronounced, separated by at
least 10 days of lifetime. This analysis suggests that
one reset per year does not affect the system’s perfor-
mance, but two or more resets do (which applies to 27%
of users). While system owners should obviously try to
minimise the number of resets required, it appears one

time after the password change/reset. Mean change is

reset per year per user is an acceptable upper bound.
The answer to our ﬁrst research question is alluded
to in the mean password strength change of 12.73 days
(as shown in Figure 5). This shows positive increases
in password strength on consecutive password changes
and resets on average. One common ﬁnding in pass-
word expiration research is that when forced to changed
one’s password, the new password will be similar to the
old one. Figure 5 indicates that this effect may also be
present in our dataset: 20% of changed passwords have
identical expiration as their previous password, and 36%
vary within 3 bits of entropy.
These ﬁgures vary slightly during the period of time
analysed here, with a gradual increase to 28% in Febru-
ary (3 months after the change in policy) but returning to
20% in June and remaining constant from then on. Prior
literature has examined this behaviour: Adams et al.
found that 50% of their participants varied some element
of their password when creating new passwords. Zhang
et al. study behaviours at greater scale, by analysing
7,700 accounts and developing an efﬁcient transforma-
tion algorithm to test for related passwords. The au-
thors are then able to break 17% of their accounts within
5 guesses, and 41% within 3 sec of CPU time (≈ 107
guesses, our estimate) [49]. While we cannot determine
the true dependence between current and prior passwords
in our dataset, the strength proxy (through Figure 5) may
suggest a similar proportion of related passwords.

ate proximity of password creation: users often forget
their newly set password. The passwords created by reset
within the ﬁrst 48 hours after changing a password have
a mean password strength of 6.9 days less than their pre-
vious password. This suggests that some users choose
a weaker password due to forgetting the previous one
(where in fact some users may be choosing weaker and
weaker passwords in a cascade). The change rate initially
decays before exhibiting the shape of a gamma distribu-
tion starting at 70 days – at the time of the ﬁrst expiration
warning email for passwords of 100-day strength, peak-
ing at just before day 100, when a large number of user
passwords expire.
These results imply that users reset their passwords
primarily for two reasons: failure to recall the password,
and the forced expiration of the password by the sys-
tem. This is in line with personal password behaviours
observed elsewhere [29]. These drivers are in contrast
to instances where users would reset their password for
primarily security reasons (such as believing that their
password has been compromised).
4.4 Password change time series
In this section we study the password strength measure
over time. The results answer two of our research ques-
tions: ‘What effect does the password policy of variable
expiration have on user’s passwords – given the freedom,
how will users choose?’ (RQ1), and ‘Are there contex-
tual circumstances of groups of users which may inﬂu-
ence their choice of password strength?’ (RQ2). In Fig-
ures 2 and 8 to 10 we apply the same 31-day moving
window to smooth out ﬂuctuations due to weekly pat-
terns (e.g., weekends, when most users are not actively
using the system).
Figure 8 shows the evolution of the university’s mean
password strength over time. Initially we observe a small
drop in strength between November ’16 and February
’17 (after the adoption of the policy), as users become
accustomed to the new system. After this, the mean
strength increases from 145.5 days to 170.1 days – an
increase by 6.9 bits of entropy. This strongly suggests
that users have adapted slowly to the new password pol-
icy, and eventually make use of their ability to increase
password lifetime by strengthening their passwords.
The ‘steady state solution’ is an approximation of the
attractor of the password change distribution. It is cal-
culated by performing a linear regression on users’ pre-
vious (x) and new password lifetimes (y). The solution
of this linear regression for y = x identiﬁes the attractor.
Users with previous passwords weaker than this attractor
tend to reduce the lifetime of their new password, and
vice versa.
Figure 6: The frequency of password changes by the
number of days relative to password expiration (day 0).
The mean time for changes is −22.18 days and the mean
time for resets is −52.09 days.

reminder on average within 24 hours and subsequently
change their password. Each following expiration warn-
ing causes an immediate increase in change rates, with
the largest peak on the day of expiration, where another
13% of users change their password. This is followed
by users resetting their passwords immediately after ex-
piration, presumably after having been denied access to
university resources. The general effect of these frequent
reminders for the organisation is that the average user
changes their password 22 days before expiration – es-
sentially reducing the lifetime of their password volun-
tarily. This indicates that users in this institution change
or reset passwords in response to reminders, and seldom
voluntarily. This might be the case for users changing
their password before even receiving the ﬁrst 30-day ad-
vance warning of expiration, as can be seen in Figure 6.
Figure 7 is an analysis of the same time series as Fig-
ure 6, but anchored at the time of password creation
rather than expiration. The main observation here is the

password strength of existing users, it is likely that the
mean password strength in the university will increase
further.
As we do not have data for the users’ password
strength before the adoption of the new password change
system and policy, we are unable to do a rigorous before-
after comparison of strength data that takes into account
all factors that may have contributed to this change –
for example the old system did not give any feedback
on their password strength. This implies that interface
design for the password creation/reset process may also
have a part to play in users increasing their password
strength (where a subset of users migrating between the
old and new systems provided feedback in Section 4.7).
As the new users have not had experience of the previ-
ous system, and as there have been no other initiatives by
the university to encourage stronger passwords, we con-
sider the increase in users’ average password expiration
likely to be a consequence of the policy, answering RQ1.
It appears to have taken around 150 days for the effect of
the policy to start to achieve its aims.
4.5 Password change time series by school
We are fortunate to have some coarse demographic in-
formation for each user recorded in the data. Figure 9
compares the evolution of password strength for selected
schools. The users of each school have together made
at least 11,000 password changes; we calculated boot-
strapped, bias-corrected and accelerated [18] conﬁdence
intervals for each of the schools. The 95% conﬁdence
intervals were within 1% of the mean for all schools in
Figure 9 from January 2017 onwards. We have hence
omitted the conﬁdence intervals. For brevity, we omit-
ted a number of smaller schools closely aligned with the
university mean.
Throughout all schools there is a statistically signif-
icant positive increase in password strength (in-sample
t-test, p = 0). The school of Education displays the low-
est increase of 18 days, while Maths and Physics in-
creased their password strength by 27 days. The differ-
ences between schools are also pronounced, with pass-
words in Engineering being 13.4 days (4 bits) stronger
than in the school of Education.
It is of note that the
university’s Education school has been part of the uni-
versity for only a few years. A joint linear regression
of the password strength changes of all faculties predict-
ing the password strength was conducted. Each school
contributed statistically signiﬁcantly, explaining 82% of
variance (R2 = 0.816, F(6,49201) = 36320, p < 10−10).
In previous research, only Mazurek et al. compare
different university units for their respective password
strength. Their password cracking algorithm managed
Figure 8: 31-day moving average of the mean password
strength of all users and new users. The ‘steady state so-
lution’ estimates the average strength of passwords in the
system if users were to continue making their passwords
stronger (or weaker) consistently with how they did so in
the current measurement window. The legend is in order
of ﬁnal values.
The evolution of the mean password strength is un-
derpinned by cyclical behaviours. A quarter of users
have a password lifetime of less than 110 days (see Fig-
ure 1), and have to change their passwords on average
every 80 days (see Figure 6), but every time they do,
they increase their average password strength. This man-
ifests twice in Figure 8: at the start of the deployment of
the new system where there are no existing users (the
increase in password strength is delayed until Febru-
ary ’17); and again with the enrollment of over 10,000
new users who set their ﬁrst password around Septem-
ber ’17 (see Figure 2), in time for the start of the new
academic year. As this large number of users have all
set their initial passwords in a short time frame, their
ﬁrst regular password change occurs from November
’17 onwards. Their change behaviour also causes the
temporary plateau around September ’17 and the subse-
quent increase of the mean password strength of all users,
which is a statistically signiﬁcant increase (paired t-test,
t(10892) = −47.19, p = 0).
The ‘steady state solution’ gives us insights into the
password changing trend over time: for example, if users
had continued to choose new passwords in the same man-
ner as they did in April ’17, the mean password lifetime
of the university would settle at 156 days. However, as
the steady state solution continues to increase, it appears
that the users are still responding to the policy. The arti-
facts of the cyclical changes are also evident in the trend.
The relatively small drop in the steady state solution
after January ’18 aligns with an increase in password re-
sets at this time (see Figure 2). This could be due to users
having forgotten their passwords after returning from the
