### Fingerprintability as a Function of Category

The fingerprintability of browser extensions varies across different categories. According to Table IV-A, many shopping extensions are detectable on at least one URL, likely because they are designed for specific online stores. Similarly, social extensions, which support popular social websites, are also highly detectable. In contrast, universal shopping extensions and those in categories such as accessibility, productivity, and photos are more content-dependent, making them detectable on any arbitrary URL.

The Pearson’s Chi-squared test confirms that fingerprintability is significantly dependent on the category of the extension. For both URL-dependent and independent on-page changes, the p-values for the null hypothesis of independence are 3.812e-15 and 2.2e-16, respectively.

### Uniqueness and Types of DOM Modifications

By analyzing the DOM changes caused by 1,656 detectable extensions, we found that nearly 90% of them perform uniquely identifiable combinations of changes. More than 86% have at least one distinct on-page side-effect that cannot be attributed to any other extension or group of extensions. This means that the majority of fingerprintable extensions make at least one unique DOM change, allowing web trackers to create signatures based on these changes and precisely attribute them to the underlying browser extension.

Ad-blockers are the main type of extension that is not uniquely identifiable. Our static honey pages use tracking scripts from well-known web trackers, which are often blacklisted by ad-blockers. However, recent research indicates that the blacklists of different ad-blockers are not identical. An interested party could potentially analyze the blacklist of each extension to pinpoint unique entries. This task, however, requires a significant upfront cost of obtaining and maintaining a large list of ad URLs and exposing all ad-blockers to these URLs to identify their "blind spots." We consider this procedure out of scope for this paper.

Table II provides statistics on the four types of modifications performed by the 1,656 fingerprintable extensions:
- **New DOM node:** 78.7%
- **Changed attribute:** 41.6%
- **Removed DOM node:** 15.8%
- **Changed text:** 4.7%

In on-the-fly content:
- **New DOM node:** 20.3%
- **Changed attribute:** 84.4%
- **Removed DOM node:** 59.9%
- **Changed text:** 61.5%

These findings suggest that extension authors who wish to protect user privacy may struggle to implement desired functionality without introducing changes to the page's DOM. We further discuss this problem and potential solutions in Section VI.

The low percentage of textual changes may be due to the limited textual content of XHOUND’s static honey pages. These pages can be extended to include a larger and more varied text corpus, including more specific words, names, and headings.

Overall, 42.9% of the fingerprintable extensions make changes to the content or the DOM hierarchies created on-the-fly by our honey pages. This highlights the value of dynamic honey pages in detecting fingerprintable extensions. Additionally, almost 90% of the 1,656 detected extensions issue at least one query to the DOM, often serving as a check to ensure the extension is on the correct page before modifying the content.

### Longitudinal Analysis of Fingerprintability

To determine whether fingerprintable DOM changes are temporal artifacts of extension development or persistent modifications, we conducted a small-scale longitudinal study. Four months after the initial collection of Chrome extensions, we examined the updated versions of a sample of 2,000 extensions. Half of these extensions were originally fingerprintable, and half were not. The results, shown in Table III, indicate that more than 90% of the extensions remained available in the Chrome store. Among the originally fingerprintable extensions, approximately 38% were updated, and 88% remained fingerprintable. An example of an extension that stopped being fingerprintable is the Hola extension, which now only sets a specific attribute on hola.org URLs, likely in response to crackdowns by streaming services like Netflix on users using VPNs to access geo-restricted content.

Nine previously invisible extensions became fingerprintable, such as Imagine Easy Scholar, which started injecting additional style sheets in recent versions.

We also assessed the fingerprintability of the "new" top 1,000 extensions compared to the "old" top 1,000. The intersection of these two sets was 79.8%, with 54.6% having updated their versions. Applying XHOUND to the new top 1,000 extensions, we found that 12.2% were fingerprintable on any arbitrary URL, and 21.6% were fingerprintable on at least one popular URL. This suggests that the fraction of fingerprintable extensions is a stable property of the extension ecosystem.

### Fingerprintability of Extensions for Other Browsers

Browser extensions' modifications to web pages, which XHOUND uses to fingerprint them, are part of the extension's organic activity rather than a specific vulnerability of a particular browser. To test this, we modified XHOUND to work with Mozilla Firefox. At the time of writing, Firefox supports several technologies for developing add-ons, with developers advised to use the WebExtensions APIs or the Add-on SDK. Since XHOUND is already compatible with the WebExtensions API, we enhanced our patching methods to intercept DOM queries from programmatically injected content scripts.

Among the most popular 1,000 Firefox extensions, 16% were fingerprintable on at least one URL, and 7.3% on any domain. These included add-ons with equally fingerprintable Chrome versions, such as Ghostery, Grammarly, Turn Off the Lights, and Privacy Badger, as well as Firefox-specific extensions like ZenMate Security & Privacy VPN. 88% of the fingerprintable Firefox extensions introduced distinct on-page changes, allowing for precise attribution. The most common types of changes were the addition of new DOM elements (67%), changing attributes (37%), and deleting parts of content (27%). These results align with our findings from Chrome extensions, indicating that extensions developed for either browser are equally likely to be fingerprintable.

### Fingerprintability of Regular Users Based on Their Extensions

In Section IV-A, we showed that a significant fraction of popular browser extensions are fingerprintable, meaning a website could infer installed extensions by preparing an appropriately-structured DOM and allowing the extensions to modify it. While knowing that an extension is installed can be used to infer user preferences, it does not alone allow for unique user identification. For users to be uniquely identifiable, they must utilize a different set of fingerprintable extensions.

### Collecting Extension-Usage Data from Real Users

To understand the sets of extensions that everyday users install and to what extent these can be used for unique identification, we deployed surveys to collect the list of installed extensions from volunteering users. Previous research on browser fingerprintability collected data by asking users to visit a website that utilized JavaScript to gather browsing environment attributes. However, since browsers do not provide APIs for collecting the list of installed extensions, we designed and implemented a browser extension that, upon installation, retrieves the list of other installed extensions and sends this list to our monitoring server in an anonymous and secure manner. The extension also calculates and sends the size of the browsing history and the number of cookies in the browser's cookie jar.

Table IV summarizes the surveys conducted:
- **Survey Audience:**
  - Friends and Colleagues: 51 participants, 148 unique extensions
  - US MTurk Workers: 313 participants, 482 unique extensions
  - Non-US MTurk Workers: 196 participants, 312 unique extensions
  - Students: 294 participants, 385 unique extensions
  - Total: 854 participants, 941 unique extensions

Table V shows the active users of extensions per survey audience:
- **Mean:**
  - Friends and Colleagues: 1,466,066
  - US MTurk Workers: 835,046
  - Non-US MTurk Workers: 1,196,496
  - Students: 1,049,267
- **Median:**
  - Friends and Colleagues: 283,909
  - US MTurk Workers: 118,696
  - Non-US MTurk Workers: 190,454
  - Students: 217,896

Since our surveys involved the installation of software, we took steps to ensure the anonymity and security of the data collected.
