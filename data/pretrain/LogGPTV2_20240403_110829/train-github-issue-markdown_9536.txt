Currently, `ext4` is the default file system type (FSType) when none is specified. However, due to various reasons, users may prefer to use a different FSType as the default. For instance, I am unable to use `ext4` for large volumes because the `mkfs` process consumes too much time and I/O resources (see issues #30240 and #30752).

I propose adding a flag to Kubernetes (possibly in the `controller-manager`) that allows users to specify the default FSType. If no FSType is specified, it should default to `ext4` to ensure that existing users are not affected by this change.
