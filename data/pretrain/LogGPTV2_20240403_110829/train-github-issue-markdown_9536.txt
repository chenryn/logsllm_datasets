Currently ext4 is always used as default FSType when none is specified. Due to
various reasons, people may want to use another FSType as default FSType. For
example, I can currently not use ext4 for large volumes due to mkfs taking too
much time and IO resources (see #30240 and #30752).
Please add a flag to kubernetes (controller-manager?), which specifies the
default FSType to use. When not specified, it should default to ext4 so that
other users are not affected by this change.
