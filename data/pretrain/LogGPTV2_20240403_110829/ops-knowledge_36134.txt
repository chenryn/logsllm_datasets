User:  How to configure a secure and usable virtual private network (VPN) connection?
Assistant: 1. Choose a trusted VPN service provider: It is important to choose a trusted VPN service provider to ensure the speed and stability of the connection, but also to ensure that data encryption is implemented correctly. 2. VPN connection based on security protocol: To ensure data encryption and privacy, a VPN connection based on security protocol must also be selected. Common VPN protocols include PPTP, SSTP, L2TP/IPSec, and OpenVPN. 3. Use strong passwords: Use strong passwords to protect remote VPN connections from unauthorized access. 4. Install the latest security patches and updates: To ensure security and critical system components, the operating system and VPN software need to be updated in a timely manner to obtain the latest security patches and updates. 5. Turn on the firewall protection: Turn on the firewall, filter and inspect data packets can effectively protect the VPN connection from the risk of attack and data leakage. 6. Configure access control: Use access control to restrict only authorized users from accessing the VPN server, ensuring that only authorized users can remotely access the company network. 7. Data encryption: When using a VPN connection, make sure that all data is transmitted in an encrypted manner to ensure that the data cannot be stolen or tampered with. 8. Two-way authentication and user authentication: Implementing authentication is one of the best measures to prevent unauthorized access. When using a VPN connection, two-way authentication and user authentication must be enabled. Two-way authentication can ensure that the identity between the currently connected device and the VPN server is verified, and authentication can ensure that only authenticated users can connect to the VPN server.
