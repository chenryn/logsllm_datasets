User: I am fetching records from gae model using cursor() and with_cursor() logic as used in paging. but i am not sure how to check that there is no any other record in db that is pointed by cursor. i am fetching these records in chunks within some iterations.when i got my required results in the first iteration then in next iteration I want to check there is no any record in model but I not get any empty/None value of cursor at this stage.please let me know how to perform this check with cursors in google app engine with python.
Assistant: i am not 100% sure about that but what i used to do is compare the last cursor with the actual cursor and i think i noticed that they were the same so i came to the conclusion that it was the last cursor.
