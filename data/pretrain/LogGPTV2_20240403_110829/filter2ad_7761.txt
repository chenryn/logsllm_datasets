INTRODUCTION  
to 
the 
thanks 
recent  advances 
The vision of mobile and ubiquitous systems is becoming a 
reality 
in  wireless 
communication  and  device  miniaturization.  However,  the 
widespread  industrial  uptake  of  these  systems  is  still 
compromised  by  the  highly  error-prone  and  heterogeneous 
mobile  provisioning  environments,  which  induce  several 
impairments to normal operation. Thus, how to improve the 
dependability of these systems is still an open issue. 
A variety of research studies have been produced proposing 
methods,  proof-of-concept  prototypes,  and  disciplines  to 
design,  develop,  and  maintain  novel  ubiquitous  services. 
Despite  these  efforts,  it  is  still  unclear  whether  current 
solutions are able to achieve the dependability level called 
for by the emergent mobile ubiquitous applications, such as 
smart  urban  mobility,  wireless  control  of  robots,  and 
ambient assisted living. This is partially due to the lack of 
interaction  between 
the  ubiquitous  computing  and 
dependable computing research communities. The different 
research perspectives cause similar problems to be treated in 
different ways, without exploiting the potential of synergies 
that  may  arise  from  a  closer  and  multi-disciplinary 
collaboration. 
The ambition and mission of ADAMUS is to put on the 
foreground  all  the  above  issues  and  to  bridge  the  gap 
between these apparently distant research communities so as 
to: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
propose  novel  solutions  to design   and  develop 
adaptive  and  dependable  mobile  ubiquitous 
systems;   
devise  conceptual  models  and  paradigms  for 
change tolerance;  
provide analytical and simulation models and tools 
to measure systems ability to withstand faults and 
to re-adjust to new environments;  
to  foster  exchange  of  ideas  and  lively  discussions 
able  to  drive  future  research  and  development 
efforts in the area.

Building on the success of the last four editions, ADAMUS 
2011  aims  at  serving  as  a  meeting  ground  and  common 
platform of discussion for researchers and industrial bodies 
in  the  field  of  adaptive  and  dependable  mobile  ubiquitous 
systems. 
Researchers  and  practitioners  have  been  encouraged  to 
participate  with  high  quality  papers  able  to  identify  open 
issues,  discuss  the  limits  and/or  advantages  of  existing 
solutions, or propose original and innovative techniques for 
adaptive  and  dependable  applications  over  mobile 
environments. 
II.  THIS YEAR’S WORKSHOP 
The multidisciplinary nature of ADAMUS is reconfirmed in 
this  fifth  edition,  whose  contributions  range  from  privacy 
leakage  in  location-based  social  networks  to  dependability 
assessment  through  the  dynamic  collection  of  failure  data 
from  mobile  phones,  and  dealing  with  different  aspects, 
such  as,  collaborative  wireless  sensing  and  quality-of-
service  routing  in  dynamic,  wireless  multi-hop  ad  hoc 
networks  with  frequent  link  breaks.  Four  high-quality 
papers  constitute  the  present  edition  –  their  main  subjects 
are briefly recalled in what follows. 
The first paper is entitled “Adaptive Collaborative Sensing 
using  Mobile  Phones  and  Stationary  Sensors”,  by  Edith 
Ngai.  The  paper 
the  opportunity  of 
complementing  sensor  networks  with  the  collaboration  of 
mobile  phones,  in  order  to  achieve  better  overall  sensing 
quality,  while  dealing  with  the  known  battery  limitations 
and  failure  prone  behaviour  of  sensor  nodes.  In  particular, 
the  author  proposes  an  adaptive  collaborative  algorithm  to 
coordinate the sensing among stationary sensors and mobile 
users in the area of interest. The algorithm is  shown to be 
able  to  achieve  a  desired  level  of  sensing  quality,  while 
minimizing  the  overall  energy  consumption,  even  when 
unusual (i.e., not planned) events are simulated to happen in 
the considered scenario.

entitled 
“Enabling  On-Line 
The 
Dependability  Assessment  of  Android  Smart  Phones,”  is 
authored by Marcello Cinque and deals with an increasingly 
important  problem  – 
the  conflicting  requirements  of 
dependability  requirements  and  as-short-as-possible  times-
to-market.  An 
this 
conundrum  is  given  by  a  logging  platform  for  Android 
smart  phones.  The  reported  approach  is  shown  to  allow 
failure data to be dynamically collected and analyzed, thus 
enabling the assessment of dependability of mobile software 
despite the rapidly evolving scenarios brought about by the 
use of ever changing third party software and features.

tackle 
In the third paper, entitled “A Novel Design of Node –
disjoint  Multi-path  QoS  Routing  in  Multi-hop  Ad  Hoc 
Networks”,  by  Szu-Lin  Su  and  Yi-Wen  Su,  authors  deal 
with the problem of frequent link breaks in dynamic mobile 
ad-hoc  networks  by  designing  a  novel  QoS-aware  routing 
protocol, based on predetermined back-up routes. The use of 
redundant paths avoids wasteful route discovery operations 
and contributes to the overall quality of the network in terms 
of delay, throughput, overhead, and blocking rate. 
Finally,  the  fourth  paper  is  “Privacy  Leakage  in  Two-
Party Group Nearest Neighbor Queries”, by Yan Huang and 
Cai  Chen.  Here  the  authors  focus  their  attention  on  group 
nearest  neighbor  queries  in  location-based  social  networks 
and assess the privacy leakage inherent in such queries. The 
risks  of  attacks  exploiting  such  leakage  are  quantified 
through a privacy leakage index and a solution to deal with 
this problem is briefly sketched. 
The  four  papers  present  different  approaches  to  design, 
monitor,  and  evaluate  the  dependability  and  security  of 
different  instances  of  adaptive  and  dependable  mobile 
ubiquitous systems and/or enabling technologies. We believe 
that  such  heterogeneity  of  topics  and  approaches  will 
contribute  significantly  to  the  discussions  at  the  workshop, 
towards the definition of a more consolidated state-of-art and 
state-of-practice  on  the  design  and  assessment  of  future 
dependable ubiquitous systems. 
III.  ACKNOWLEDGMENENTS 
Achieving  as  challenging  a  goal  as  those  of  ADAMUS 
would  never  be  possible  without 
the  extraordinary 
dedication and good will of a strong and  highly motivated 
pool of Friends, whose availability and support ADAMUS 
can always depend on!  Indubitably one of the key reasons 
behind  our  success  so  far, 
the  ADAMUS  Program 
Committee provided their invaluable contributions also this 
year  in  many  ways,  including  the  selection  of  the  papers 
accepted in the present edition. In particular we would like 
to express our gratitude – on behalf of the entire ADAMUS 
community  –  to  Marcello  Cinque,  a  main  player  in 
guaranteeing  the  success  of  this  year’s  edition.  We  would
