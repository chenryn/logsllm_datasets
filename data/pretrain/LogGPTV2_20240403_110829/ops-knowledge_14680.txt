User: Please provide a complete and feasible application performance testing plan, including test objectives, test environment, test cases, test tools, etc.
Assistant: Test objectives: Conduct application performance tests on a certain website to evaluate the performance of the website under various load conditions, such as: response time, throughput, number of concurrent users, server response time and maximum load, etc., and discover and solve Potential problems and bottlenecks, to ensure that the website can also guarantee a good user experience under high load conditions. Test environment: - Server configuration: CPU: 4 cores, memory: 16GB, hard disk: 256GB SSD - Server operating system: Windows Server 2016 - Test tool: Apache JMeter - Testers: 3-4 people, including test managers, test engineers and Test Assistant - Test Data: Simulate 1000 users logging in, clicking, browsing and searching at the same time The average response time of the page - Simulate multiple users operating at the same time, count whether the response time has an increasing trend, and analyze the reasons Expected results: The average response time of each page does not exceed 3 seconds, and with the increase of the number of users, the response time There will be a significant increasing trend. 2. Concurrency test Test steps: - Simulate 1000 users accessing the homepage at the same time, and count the page throughput and the number of concurrent users - Gradually increase the login, search, ordering and other operations, and count the throughput and the number of concurrent users - Test the normal operation status The maximum load, inferring whether the system can handle a larger amount of users Expected results: - No timeouts or errors in the test - The increase in the number of users will not cause system bottlenecks 3. Database performance test Test steps: - Add 1 to the database 10,000 pieces of data, test whether the insertion is smooth; delete 10,000 pieces of data, test the deletion performance - simulate multiple users accessing the database at the same time, test the read and write performance Expected results: The average response time of database access is within 500 milliseconds, and the performance is stable and reliable. Testing tools: Use Apache JMeter for performance testing, JMeter is an open source testing tool that can simulate multi-user, multi-protocol and multi-environment testing. JMeter can simulate a variety of WEB protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SOAP, JDBC, etc., and has functions such as locking threads, load balancing, compression, and distributed testing. JMeter can generate different types of reports, including performance analysis index data such as offset value, standard deviation, and median. After the test, an overall performance analysis report should be obtained, which should include the worst performance data, average data, the highest number of user simulations, a summary of abnormal conditions, and an overall analysis and recommendation for product capabilities under a simulated performance load.
