User: Based on the business scenario, design a high-availability architecture solution and explain its implementation principle.
Assistant: Scenario description: Suppose there is a shopping website that needs to ensure high availability, stable performance and no data loss even under high concurrency. Architecture solution: 1. Use a load balancer: Add a load balancer at the web server layer to distribute requests to multiple servers to achieve horizontal expansion and improve performance and availability. 2. Use CDN: Use CDN to cache static resources to speed up access. CDN has the characteristics of multi-node, distributed, and high availability, which can effectively reduce the load of web servers, increase access speed, and improve user experience. 3. Use a distributed storage system: Use a distributed storage system to store data in multiple places to ensure data reliability and non-loss; and can achieve horizontal expansion through data fragmentation, improve read and write performance and scalability sex. 4. Use multiple data centers: Deploy the same application system and database in multiple data centers to achieve distributed data backup and disaster recovery, avoiding single point of failure; at the same time, deploying in different geographical locations can improve access speed and reduce network delay . Implementation principle: 1. The load balancer distributes requests to multiple servers through algorithms, such as round robin, source address Hash and other algorithms, to ensure that the load of each server is balanced. 2. CDN reduces the pressure on the web server by caching static resources, thereby improving performance and availability. 3. The distributed storage system guarantees the reliability and availability of data through data fragmentation and multiple copy storage, and uses multiple nodes to jointly process requests to improve performance. 4. Multi-data center Through the deployment of multiple data centers, distributed data backup and multi-regional load balancing are realized, while single point of failure is avoided.
