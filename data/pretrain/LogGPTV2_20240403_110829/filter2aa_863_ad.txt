UWB Real Time Locating Systems: How Secure Radio Communications May Fail in Practice
2. Methodology and Attack Demos
With these data, two different metrics can be computed, 
related to the power level of the tag transmission: the First 
Path Power Level (FPPL) and the Receive Power Level 
(RPL). According to the documentation of the Decawave 
DW1000,20 the UWB chip on which these (and many other) 
RTLS are based:
Where A is a constant for a Pulse Recurrence Frequency. 
When working at 16 MHz, it is 115.72; when working at 
64MHz, it is 121.74 dB.
It is not possible to directly estimate the absolute distance 
given a certain power level. Tests were completed, and this 
estimation seems too influenced by the environmental 
conditions that exist at the instant of the measurement.
However, what can be done with decent accuracy is to 
assume that, if the power level information (either first 
path or total received) is identical (or inside a certain level 
of acceptance) in all positioning packets generated in a 
given moment t0, the tag j0 that caused the generation of 
the aforementioned positioning packets is located exactly 
(or about exactly) at the same distance from all anchors.
In other words, given a pair of anchors, the difference 
of the distance between a tag j0 and anchor i0 and the 
tag j0 and anchor i1 is 0, thus implying that GT(i0, j0, t0) = 
GT(i1, j0, t0). This is also true for the reference anchor, thus 
GT(reference, j0, t0) = GT(i0, j0, t0).
This equation is very important, because, for the reference 
anchor, the Clock Skew is 1 and the time of flight from itself 
is 0 by definition. Consequently, it is possible to use this 
equation for each of the other non-reference anchors to 
estimate their times of flight. From those, the distance of 
each anchor with respect to the reference anchor can be 
estimated with enough accuracy.

As a matter of fact, this is the equation 5 that was present 
in section 2.2.2.
If the distance from all anchors is identical, this means that:
And that:
However, considering equation 4:
This means that we can derive:
However, considering that CS(reference, t0) = 1 and 
ToF(reference) = 0 by definition:
And we can conclude that:
This equation is used to obtain an accurate estimation of 
the distances of all anchors with respect to the reference 
anchor. However, having the distances is not enough: 
to compute the position of a tag, the coordinates of the 
anchors are required.
For this purpose, an adversary can leverage an installation 
constraint that is common in RTLS: due to dilution of 
precision problems, RTLS vendors require that anchors are 
positioned in a shape that is as regular as possible. Ideally, it 
must be a square whenever possible, at most a rectangle21  
(Figure 39).
An attacker that can listen to the traffic on the wire can 
also adapt the expected shape on the basis of the number 
of anchors detected in the communications. For instance, 
if they detect 4 anchors, it is likely a rectangle; if 6 anchors, 
it could be a hexagon or a rectangle with two anchors 
positioned in the middle of the longest side.

0 = (GT(reference, j0, t0) - GT(i0, j0, t0)) * c
GT(reference, j0, t0) = GT(i0, j0, t0)

ToF(reference) = CS(i0, t0) * (pTs(i0, j0, t0) - sTS(i0, t0)) - ToF(i0)
pTs(reference, j0, t0) - sTS(reference, t0) =

2. Methodology and Attack Demos
Given that the distance of each anchor with respect to 
the reference anchor is known, and given that it can now 
be safely assumed that the anchor map is as regular as 
possible and usually a rectangle, by arbitrarily setting the 
reference anchor in position (0;0), the coordinates of all 
other anchors can be easily estimated, because they will 
be given by the two shortest distances obtained from the 
estimation of the times of flight.
For instance, let’s say that we determined that the 
distances of anchors from the reference anchor are 5m, 
7m, and 8.5m. It can safely be estimated that the anchor 
coordinates are (0;0), (5;0), (0;7), and (5;7), with 8.5m being 
the diagonal of the rectangle. There is also the possibility 
of the specular result (0;0), (0;5), (7;0), and (7;5), but this is 
not a problem—it is just a matter of defining a coordinate 
system and sticking to it.
This was actually tested in the Avalue RTLS, using both 
FPPL and the RPL. According to the tests done, the best 
results are obtained using the FPPL with a threshold of 1% 
between the lowest power level and the highest power 
level read in a given positioning communication. However, 
this situation is rare: an attacker may want to use the RPL 
or raise the threshold in case no suitable communications 
appear on the wire.

2. Methodology and Attack Demos
As shown in the chart below, using the FPPL with 
threshold set to 1%, it was possible to estimate the anchor 
distances with an error of less than 10% with respect to 
the real value. Remembering that this translates into an 
average error of less than 20% during the computation of 
the tag positions, this can be accurate enough for attack 
scenarios where cm-level precision is not required.
In the previous sections, we defined the scope of our 
research, described the necessary data and steps to 
compute the position of a tag, detailed the reverse 
engineering work that allows timestamps to be located 
inside the network packets, and explained how an attacker 
can fulfil the last requirement, that is, estimating the 
anchors coordinates. 
In this chapter, we describe the adversary Tactics, 
Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), which is the behavior 
of an attacker wanting to practically abuse these systems. 
After discussing how a threat actor can obtain access to 
the target information, we present the two types of attacks 
that can be enacted: the passive eavesdropping attack, 
which allows the position of all tags in the network to be 
reconstructed, and the active traffic manipulation attack, 
which allows the position of tags detected by the RTLS to 
be modified.
2.5.1 Traffic Interception
To perform any meaningful attacks against these RTLS 
systems, it is first necessary to:
1. Gain a foothold inside the backhaul network used by the 
anchors and server for their communications;
2. Execute a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack, to intercept 
all network packets exchanged among anchors and 
server, and, notably, the synchronization and positioning 
timestamps.

2. Methodology and Attack Demos
Network Access: Both Sewio and Avalue RTLS allow either 
Ethernet or Wi-Fi to be used for the network backhaul.
Gaining access to an Ethernet network requires that an 
attacker either compromise a computer connected to 
that network, or surreptitiously add a rogue device to the 
network. Besides of course depending on the computer 
security practices adopted by the asset owner, the 
complexity of these actions also varies on the basis of the 
chosen deployment configuration. As a matter of fact, 
some UWB RTLS allow anchors and a server to be placed 
in heterogeneous subnetworks, with the only requirement 
being that those networks are routed22 (Figure 40). In 
such cases, there is an increased likelihood of successfully 
compromising or surreptitiously adding one system 
in any of the networks traversed by the network 
communications, if those networks and devices are not 
adequately designed and protected.
As for Wi-Fi, both solutions support WPA2-PSK as 
the security protocol for protecting the wireless 
communications. Thus, gaining access to the network 
usually requires either knowledge of the WPA2 password, 
or the exploitation (if any) of vulnerabilities in the wireless 
network appliances.

2. Methodology and Attack Demos
As for the first point, it must be stated that both solutions, 
out of the box, feature a static password that can be found 
in the public documentation23,24 (Figure 41). In case an asset 
owner does not change it, obtaining access to the backhaul 
network is simple.
Man in the Middle (MitM): Depending on the position 
gained, just obtaining access to the network may not be 
enough. Since in both RTLS the anchors do not send the 
information via broadcast packets, a MitM attack might still 
be required to intercept the communications. However, in 
the tests executed, it was possible to conduct a MitM on 
both solutions via standard ARP spoofing attacks just by 
having one foothold on the backhaul network, and without 
the RTLSs showing any warnings or abnormal behavior that 
may alert an operator.
The following code command launched from a workstation 
connected to a generic port of the backhaul network 
switch allowed all anchors-to-server communications to be 
intercepted, as well as all server-to-anchors ones:
arpspoof -i attacker_eth -t server_ip anchor1_ip & 
arpspoof -i attacker_eth -t anchor1_ip server_ip

By repeating this command for all the anchors in 
the system, it is quickly possible to intercept all the 
generated traffic.
Figure 42 and Figure 43 report the log of the code 
commands and the network traffic captured via Wireshark 
of a successful MitM attack executed against both solutions.

2.5.2 Passive Eavesdropping Attacks
If an attacker has managed to obtain access to an RTLS 
network and has successfully launched a MitM attack 
against the anchors and the server, they can now 
reconstruct the position of tags in the network by simply 
following one of the standard TDoA algorithms available 
in literature, such as the one explained in section 2.2.2.
In this section, as an example, an execution trace of the 
previously mentioned algorithm is reported. The aim is to 
locate an Avalue RTLS tag when positioned roughly in the 
center of a monitored room. Figure 44 shows the position 
of the tag as depicted by the RTLS web application.

90000a052, 90000a05a, 90000a05b, and 90000a05e 
are the four anchors in use by the RTLS. 1300000020 is 
the tag. The four anchors are located at the following 2D 
coordinates:
 y Coordinates of 90000a052 = (0, 0)
 y Coordinates of 90000a05a = (6.3308356, 0)
 y Coordinates of 90000a05b = (6.989999001, -5.28999995)
 y Coordinates of 90000a05e = (-0.2500003, -4.91999999)
To start with, it is necessary to compute the global 
times of the positioning packets, so that they can be 
compared together. As indicated by equation 4, besides 
the collection of all positioning timestamps, this requires 
capturing the synchronization timestamps of the same 
iteration, as well as the synchronization timestamps of 
the previous iteration.
By looking at the Wireshark traffic (Figure 45), the 
timestamps to capture are the ones included in the 
packets highlighted in pink. Notice that, in this capture, 
the reference anchor was 90000a052, and that, in the 
Avalue RTLS, the synchronization timestamp of the 
reference anchor is duplicated in all synchronization 
packets sent by the non-reference anchors.

The following information was thus extracted:
By using equation 3, it is possible to compute the Clock 
Skews of all anchors for that iteration.
With the coordinates reported above, it is possible to derive 
the times of flight for all non-reference anchors with respect 
to the reference one, by simply computing their distance 
and dividing it by the speed of light, i.e., the approximated 
speed of a signal travelling through air.
With these data, it is possible to derive the global times of 
the positioning packets.
Having found the global times of the positioning packets, it is 
now necessary to compute the distance differences for each 
non-reference anchor with respect to the reference one.
