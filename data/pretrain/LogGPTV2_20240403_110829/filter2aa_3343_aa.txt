Phase 0: Preparations
Make sure the station to be converted is in good working order on its original 
frequencies before attempting conversion to Amateur Radio use. Note that a Fault light 
on the Receiver Synthesizer Module may be the result of a missing External Reference 
Source, or the result of the previous owner attempting to program the radio out of range. 
Verify in programming software and set source to internal if that is the case.
About 90% of the screws in the MASTR-III T/R Frame are Torx T-15. The remaining are 
Phillips #2 and T-6, T-8, T-10, which are mostly found in the power supply module and 
power amplifier.
To tune the Receiver Front End module properly, I recommend access to a service 
monitor with a spectrum analyzer (HP-8920 series, IFR-1600S or similar). It is possible 
to use a signal generator and a frequency selective RF volt meter, or service monitor 
with simultaneous generate and receive but not as easy as you can’t see where the 
peaks and dips are.
You will need to acquire a copy of TQ-3353 Mastr-IIe, III Programming Software 
(M2E.BAT, M3.BAT). This should also come with TQ-0619 (MASTRUTL.BAT) 
Full Modification requires some surface mount soldering as well as through hole 
soldering. You will need a quality soldering Iron. I use a Weller with a 800 degree Tip R. 
You will need basic de-soldering equipment such as a Sold-a-pult ™ and Thick gauge 
solder wick.
0.015” solder, and fine tweezers is needed for the surface mount parts. You will also 
need thicker gauge solder such as 0.025” and a brute force tip for use on the VCO coils. 
I recommend 2% silver solder.
The station that was converted contains the following modules:
UHF Transmit Synthesizer, Group 6 (403 – 430 MHz)
UHF Receive Synthesizer, Group 3 (424.4 MHz - 451.4 MHz)
UHF Front End, Group 11 (410 – 430 MHz)
UHF Power Amplifier, Group 6 (403 – 425 MHz)
Please note that the G11 Front end uses high side LO injection hence the need for a G3 
Synthesizer which normally provides low side injection for the G3 (450 – 470 MHz) front 
end.
Phase 1: Operating Frequency Reprogramming
Please Refer to LBI38540D
Connection to the repeater is done with a straight through DB-9 RS-232 cable. Connect 
either to the Data Port on the front of the repeater or the DB-9 connection on the rear of 
the interface board.
MASTRUTL.BAT is used as a utility to verify station operation and to set potentiometer 
values. 
You will use this application to set the repeat audio levels and transmitter power output. 
It can also help diagnose the repeater to a degree with the ability to convey that one or 
more modules are malfunctioning.
M2E.BAT and M3.BAT are designed to change the station operating parameters, such 
as CTCSS tones, hang times and in the case of the MASTR-III the operating 
frequencies.
It is important that the software be in MASTR-III mode. Programming the repeater with 
the software in M2e mode may inadvertently brick the System Module requiring 
replacement. Start the software with M3.BAT. Be sure the screen looks like above with 
the ‘MASTR-III Control Shelf Programming’ at the top.
This software has some compatibility issues as it is an older DOS based program. A PIII 
tablet with a USB to RS-232 adapter and WinXP would not program, but a PII laptop 
with a hardware based serial port and WinXP would.
Read and save the current configuration. Use F6. Read it twice, once as a backup then 
the other as the file you will be editing.
Once that is done highlight the file you will be editing and hit F2. Edit the data to your 
new operating parameters. We will be using low side injection from the Receiver 
Synthesizer Module, It is necessary to configure this in the programming. With the RX 
frequency field highlighted, Press ‘CTRL E’. When prompted, press ‘O’ for opposite side 
injection.
Use F9 over any field to get a description of what it adjusts. For some reason ‘space’ is 
not an allowed character when programming the morse code ID so don’t pull your hair 
out. Once done save the data by pressing F10 and then F1 and confirm the over write.
Send programming data to the repeater by pressing F5 and selecting the file you just 
edited.
The Fault LEDs on the Transmitter and Receiver synthesizer modules should now be lit 
as the PLLs are no longer able to lock. There may be a slight flicker on the LEDs as the 
System Module will be attempting to reset the synthesizers until the Fault clears.
Phase 2: UHF Transmitter Synthesizer Module
Please Refer to LBI38671N
This procedure transforms the module Group 6 (403 – 430 MHz) module fairly close to 
Group 7 (425 – 450 MHz). 
My station was equipped with a Group 3 Receive Synthesizer which provides high side 
injection for the Group 11 Front End. This means the module has a designed output 
range of 428.6 – 448.6 MHz. Therefore it was decided that the ideal course of action 
was to switch the VCO coils.
Remove the Transmitter Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame.  Using a Torx T-15 
screwdriver, remove the top and bottom lids of the module. Remove the VCO cover.
From the underside of the board desolder L1 and set it aside. L1 should be Red. 
Remove the excess solder from L1 and the L1 mounting holes on the PCB with solder 
wick.
Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame. Using a Torx T-15 
screwdriver, remove the top and bottom lids of the module. Remove the VCO cover. 
Salvage L10 from the Receiver Synthesizer and carefully set it aside. L10 should be 
Yellow. Remove the excess solder from L10 and the L10 mounting holes on the PCB 
with solder wick.
Perform the following parts swap:
Replace C5 with 10pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805, Please note C5 is on the under side 
of the board.
Solder RX Synthesizer L10 (Yellow) in the TX Synthesizer L1 position.
Solder TX Synthesizer L1 (Red) in the RX Synthesizer L10 position.
Modified Transmit Synthesizer VCO
Please note that C4 and C5 are on the under side of the board.
Replace FL201 with GE Part Number 19A705458P5, this part can be found in some 
Front End Modules. Or retune FL201 to pass approximately 425 – 450 MHz. This is 
done by soldering a RG-58 jumper to the input side of the filter and sweep generating 
into it while viewing the output from the RF output jack. Slugs should be approximately 2 
turns above flush with the cans. Once tuned place some electrical tape over the slugs. 
VCO Tuning has to be done with the shielding in place. Reassemble the module and 
replace the card back into the T/R frame. Do not connect Reference Input yet. Connect 
a spectrum analyzer or a frequency counter that can tolerate +10dBm and adjust C10 
until the module is at the lowest desired usable frequency. I set this at 435 MHz. Metal 
tools will affect tuning so adjust and remove.
If tuning can not be achieved, add 0.5 - 3.3pF capacitor to the C4 position and try again.
Temporarily insert the Receive Synthesizer into the T/R frame and connect reference 
output to the reference input of the Transmit Synthesizer. Put the station into transmit 
mode and notice that the Fault LED should no longer be lit and module is transmitting 
on frequency.
With a spectrum analyzer verify the output of the module to be approximately 10 - 20 
mW (10 – 13 dBm)
Transmitter Synthesizer Spectrum Analysis
Phase 3: UHF Receiver Synthesizer Module
Please Refer to LBI38672L
Please note that the Group 11 Front End (410 – 430 MHz) uses a Group 3 (450 – 470 
MHz) Synthesizer, which generates high side Local Oscillator injection. We are 
converting the receiver synthesizer to act similar to a Group 8 (380 – 400 MHz) module, 
which provides 401.4 – 421.4 MHz. 
The converted module will now provide low side injection for the Group 11 front end 
from 403.6 – 428.6 MHz, Note that this is fairly close to the original Group 6 Transmitter. 
The output frequency of the Receiver Synthesizer Module will be Receive Frequency - 
21.4 MHz. i.e. 441.3 MHz - 21.4 MHz = 419.9 MHz.
Low side injection is more desirable for Amateur applications as the receive images will 
be from the Government band opposed to the Commercial band and UHF TV. 
Remove the Receiver Synthesizer Module from the T/R frame. This should already be 
disassembled from Phase 2 of the conversion process.
Retune filter FL1 to pass 403 – 430 MHz. This is done by soldering a RG-58 jumper to 
the input side of the filter and sweep generating into it while viewing the output from the 
LO output jack.  
Remove C6 and set it aside
Replace C3 with 27pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805 salvaged from C6
Replace C5 with 12pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805
Replace C6 with 18-22pF Ceramic NP0 (C0G) 0805, Use 22pF for RX 440 – 445 MHz 
or 18pF for 445 – 450 MHz
Modified Receive Synthesizer VCO
Reattach the bottom lid and the VCO can.
You will now have to remove the Receiver Front End Module and IF Module from the 
T/R frame so you can access the tuning adjustments of the VCO.
Tuning can be done two ways. The first is place the Synthesizer back into the T/R frame 
and adjust the VCO capacitor, C52 with a ‘greenie’ until the Fault LED extinguishes. 
‘Center’ the capacitors tuning range by adjusting C52 and noting where Fault lights and 
split the difference. Metal tools will affect tuning so adjust and remove.
The second method requires a couple of jumpers be installed first. Solder a wire jumper 
between U14 pin 11 (V_Tune) and +5 found at U15 pin 3. Next install a small wire lead 
between (Enable Test) found on R86 and Ground found on C63. 
Insert the module into the T/R frame and connect a frequency counter to LO Output.
