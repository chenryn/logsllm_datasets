## Abstract

Malicious actors register thousands of new domains daily to launch large-scale attacks such as spam, phishing, and drive-by downloads. Rapid and accurate determination of a domain's reputation (its association with malicious activity) is crucial for mitigating threats and protecting users. However, existing domain reputation systems typically rely on observing domain usage (e.g., lookup patterns, hosted content), which often occurs too late to prevent the initial damage.

To address this, we explore the use of features evident at the time of domain registration to predict subsequent malicious activity. We introduce PREDATOR, a system that establishes domain reputation using only time-of-registration features. Our approach is based on the observation that malicious actors need to acquire many domains to ensure profitability and attack agility, leading to abnormal registration behaviors (e.g., burst registrations, textually similar names).

We evaluate PREDATOR using five months of registration logs for second-level .com and .net domains. PREDATOR achieves a 70% detection rate with a false positive rate of 0.35%, making it an effective and early first line of defense against DNS domain misuse. It predicts malicious domains at the time of registration, typically days or weeks before they appear on existing DNS blacklists.

## 1. Introduction

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical service for mapping names to IP addresses in the Internet. However, attackers abuse the DNS to direct victims to websites hosting scams, malware, and other malicious content. To mitigate these threats, operators build reputation systems for domain names to identify those associated with malicious activity. Commonly, these systems use blacklists to curate "bad domains." A network operator can use such a blacklist to determine if certain traffic or infrastructure is associated with malicious activity.

Unfortunately, maintaining a DNS blacklist is challenging due to the high rate of domain registrations and the variety of attacks. For example, around 80,000 new domains are registered daily in the .com zone, with peak rates exceeding 1,800 registrations in a single five-minute interval. Establishing domain reputation is thus a continuous, automated process based on DNS domain features. Existing systems primarily use DNS lookup characteristics or web page crawling to distinguish legitimate from malicious domains. However, these systems have limitations:
1. Limited visibility into various attacks across time, potentially missing malicious activities.
2. Delayed detection, as reputation is established after malicious activity is underway.
3. Inability to prevent malicious domain registrations, allowing attackers to sustain campaigns by registering new domains.

The ideal time to establish domain reputation is at the time of registration, before malicious actors can profitably use them. We design PREDATOR (Proactive Recognition and Elimination of Domain Abuse at Time-Of-Registration), a proactive reputation system that accurately and automatically identifies malicious domains at the time of registration. This early detection benefits multiple stakeholders:
1. Network operators can take preemptive actions, such as greylisting emails containing suspicious newly-registered domains.
2. Registries or registrars can require stricter documentation or verification for domains with low predicted reputation.
3. Law enforcement and security professionals can prioritize investigation efforts and take down malicious sites early.

PREDATOR leverages the fact that malicious actors must register large quantities of domains in bulk to remain agile as individual domains are blacklisted. These registrations exhibit telltale signatures, including types of domains and temporal registration patterns, distinguishing them from benign behavior.

Developing a time-of-registration DNS domain reputation system is challenging due to limited information available. We identify features based on:
1. Delegated registrars and hosting infrastructure.
2. Structural characteristics of the domain name.
3. Previous registration history.
4. Correlations with registration bursts.

We evaluate PREDATOR using five months of .com and .net domain registration logs, showing it can accurately determine domain reputation with a low false positive rate (0.35%) and a good detection rate (70%). PREDATOR provides early detection, often days or weeks before existing blacklists, reducing the window during which malicious actors can profitably use a domain. It also complements existing blacklists by capturing additional domains hosting spam-related content.

**Contributions:**
- We develop an approach to establish domain reputation based on time-of-registration features, providing early detection of potentially malicious domains.
- We identify and encode 22 features that help distinguish abusive from legitimate domain registration behavior, 16 of which are novel.
- We incorporate these features into a state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithm and implement a prototype version of PREDATOR.
- We perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of PREDATOR using five months of .com and .net domain registration logs, demonstrating its effectiveness in complementing existing blacklists.

## 2. Background

The registration process for second-level domains involves three main participants: registrants, registrars, and registries. Registrants apply online to a registrar, which is accredited by ICANN to contract with registries to sell domains. The registrar submits registration requests to the registry, which manages the top-level domain (TLD). The registry allocates the domain name, adds the registration data to a central database, and publishes DNS records. The updates occur in near real-time, with a short interval between registration and activation. Registrars charge registrants and pay a fee to the registry, which in turn pays ICANN for new domain names in the TLD zone.

Domain registration periods range from one to ten years. Upon expiration, registrants can renew, or the domain is removed and becomes available for re-registration. Domains are categorized as brand-new (registered for the first time) or re-registration (previously appeared in the zone and now re-registered). Re-registration domains can be further classified as drop-catch (re-registered immediately after expiry) or retread (some time has passed since previous removal). Information about expiring domains can be obtained from registries or third-party sites.

## 3. Case Study: Spammer Domains

To illustrate how spammers exhibit distinctive registration behavior, consider the following example from registrar Moniker. Figure 1 shows the counts of .com domain registrations from Moniker on a day in March 2012. The x-axis represents the hour of the day (Eastern time), and the y-axis shows the count of .com domain registrations for every five-minute epoch. Black bars indicate domains subsequently appearing on blacklists, while white bars represent non-blacklisted domains.

These instances provide insights into the characteristics of spammer domain registrations, such as:
- **Burst Registrations:** Table 1 shows detailed statistics of the five registration spikes in Figure 1. A five-minute epoch may see tens or even hundreds of domains registered for later spam activities. Miscreants exploit bulk registration discounts offered by registrars. For example, Moniker offers a 5% discount for over 100 .com domains, and GoDaddy provides a 36% discount, lowering the annual price from $12.99 to $8.29.
- **Textual Similarity:** Table 2 lists brand-new spammer domains registered in a single epoch (1:10–1:15 PM EDT). The domain names share common strings, indicating a pattern of bulk registration.

## 4. PREDATOR Operation

Figure 2 illustrates how PREDATOR operates. We derive domain registration information from zone updates. The Domain Name Zone Alert (DNZA) files contain changes to the zone, including additions, removals, and changes to associated nameservers and their IP addresses. DNZA files provide a real-time feed of domain registrations, recorded in five-minute intervals (epochs). Domains registered in the same epoch often share common properties.

PREDATOR operates in two modes: offline training and online operation.

**Training Mode:**
Based on domain registration information, we extract three types of statistical features:
- **Domain Profile Features:** Focus on the current registration, derived from public WHOIS information and domain names.
- **Registration History Features:** Based on previous registration history, acquired from third-party services or available at registrars and registries.
- **Batch Correlation Features:** Examine domains registered from the same registrar within the same epoch.

We use prior knowledge to label a set of known spammer and non-spammer domains. The learning module uses a supervised learning technique to build a classifier based on the extracted features.

**Operation Mode:**
Upon a new domain registration, we extract the corresponding features and incorporate them into the classifier. The classifier assigns a reputation score by aggregating the learned weights. If a domain is registered for malicious activities, we expect a low reputation score. Conversely, a high score indicates a legitimate domain. If the score is below a threshold, we generate a detection report flagging the domain as malicious. Network operators or users can then take appropriate actions.
