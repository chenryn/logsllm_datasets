Assistant: Whether there is an exception: There is an exception Exception type: Security exception Exception reason/solution: The "authentication failure" prompt appears in the log information, indicating that the system failed authentication during the PAM authentication process, which is a security exception. This exception may be caused by a hacker or attacker trying to connect through the SSH protocol, but unable to log in to the system due to authentication failure. It is recommended to conduct a more stringent security review of the system, and choose whether to prohibit the user's access or further investigate the user's identity and purpose based on the review results. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate appropriate security policies, strengthen network monitoring and auditing, respond to possible security threats in a timely manner, and consider using more secure authentication methods to improve system security.
