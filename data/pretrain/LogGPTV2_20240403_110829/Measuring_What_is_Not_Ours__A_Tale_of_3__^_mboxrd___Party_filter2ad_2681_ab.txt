Distinct Webpages

downloaded in parallel. Therefore, for these webpages, the 3P downloads do not
lie on the critical path. However, for other webpages, 3P downloads contribute
to up to 50% of the total PLT, in the median case. For these webpages, when 3P
assets are downloaded, none of the 1P assets are being downloaded. Therefore,
for these webpages, 3P downloads lie on the webpage critical path and thus
introduce additional latency to the overall PLT. Note that the variation in 3PTR
in Fig. 5 arises from the variation in the network conditions, or server processing
time. Speciﬁcally, as the load time of a 3P asset changes, the 3PTR changes as
well.
In Fig. 6, we separate 3PTR based on 3P providers. Speciﬁcally, for each 3P
provider on the critical path, we show a boxplot distribution of the 3PTR con-
tributed by that 3P provider. From the ﬁgure we observe that while some 3P
providers impact PLT of some pages by as low as 5%, other 3Ps contribute
up to 40% of PLT for some webpages. Therefore, to speedup websites it is ﬁrst
important to understand which 3P provider impacts PLT and then mitigate its
impact.
We observe similar impact of 3P on PLT when loading a diﬀerent set of
376 webpages using Gomez Wired Last-Mile clients. In Fig. 7, we show that the
median 3PTR is zero for about 40% of the webpages. For the rest 60% of the
webpages, 3Ps contribute as much as 50% of the PLT in the median case. As
observed earlier, the variation in 3PTR comes from the variation in load times of

3P assets. Additionally and similarly to Fig. 6, in Fig. 8 we observe that some
3Ps impact PLTs of some webpages as low as 1%, while other 3Ps impact PLT
as much as 50%.
Finally, using the measurement data from HTTP Archive, in Fig. 9 we show
the 3PTR distribution for the top 16,000 Alexa webpages. For example, we see
that for about 50% of the webpages served by CDNs A, B, and C, 3Ps contribute
at least 20% of the total PLT, even when webpages are loaded from a cloud
datacenter network. For webpages served by CDN D we see that about 65% of
the webpages have zero 3PTR, because many webpages served by CDN D are for
its own products that do not contain any 3P assets.
5 Selecting Third Party Objects for Optimization
Based on our analysis of 3P impact on PLT in diﬀerent types of networks,
we argue for 1Ps (such as a CDN provider) to rewrite critical 3P URLs and
redirect requests onto their infrastructures to reduce 3PTR. Speciﬁcally, rewriting
critical 3P URLs eliminates DNS lookup time for multiple 3P hostnames, as a
rewritten URL can point to the hostname of the basepage that the browser has
resolved already. Additionally, URL rewriting allows clients to connect to already
warmed-up TCP connections to much closer 1P servers and download 3P content
while eliminating TCP slow start and time to setup new TCP connections to
distant 3P servers.
Next, when the request to download a 3P resource arrives at the 1P server,
the 1P delivers the requested content in one of the following two ways: (1) either
from the server’s cache; or (2) by retrieving the requested resource from the 3P
server over a proactively established TCP connection. For example, while the
ﬁrst request for a 3P resource is fetched from 3P servers, subsequent requests for
the same resource are served from 1P cache. While it is possible that many clients
request a speciﬁc resource URL, the response for which needs to be personalized
according to the user proﬁle, the 1Ps will need to always fetch the resource from
the original 3P server. For such resources, the client requests contain a cookie in
the HTTP headers that enables 3P servers to customize responses accordingly.
Rewriting 3P URLs for resources that require a 3P cookie in the request, or
in the response, introduces challenges for 1Ps to reliably perform URL rewriting.
Speciﬁcally, many 3P providers process cookies to perform visitor counts for each
resource, track user activities, generate responses based on user’s recent activi-
ties, among others. Therefore, when 1Ps proxy 3P traﬃc on their infrastructure,
requests may appear to originate from a smaller pool of 1P server IP addresses –
negatively impacting the visitor count and user tracking services for 3P providers.
Although, 1Ps could add an x-Forwarded-For header in the forwarded HTTP
requests, 3P servers will need to process this header to accurately track users.
Finally, if many 3P requests containing user cookies originate from a unreason-
ably small pool of 1P IP addresses, 3P servers may interpret these requests as a
part of a Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack.
In Fig. 10, we show the number of 3P objects that require cookies in requests
and/or responses for the top 16,000 Alexa webpages. From the ﬁgure we observe

that for about 50% of the total websites, at least 70% of the 3P objects do
not require cookies in requests and responses. Therefore, it is promising for 1P
providers to speed up webpages by rewriting URLs for those critical 3P resources
that do not require cookies neither in HTTP requests, nor in HTTP responses.
We argue that for each webpage that a 1P provider serves, the provider could
proactively download 3P resources to identify those that do not contain any
cookies and thereafter apply URL rewriting to redirect requests for only those
3P resources to its own infrastructure before sending the basepage HTML to the
client.
6 Third Party Content Acceleration via URL Rewriting
We clone several webpages on a major CDN provider’s infrastructure, where
each webpage has two versions: (1) where 3P resources are downloaded from 3P
servers, and (2) where URLs of 3P resources are rewritten to download from 1P
servers. In Figs. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, we show distributions of 200 PLTs for
diﬀerent webpages loaded under diﬀerent mobile and wired network conditions.
Note that the y-axis in these ﬁgures is on a log scale. To measure PLTs under
diﬀerent mobile network conditions, we utilize our previous work on simulating
cellular networks [24]. For simulating wired network conditions, we only control
end-to-end (E2E) latency between clients and servers, as in our observations
packet loss on wired networks is minimal and bandwidth is not the limiting
factor.
In Figs. 11 and 12, we select a webpage with 3PTR of about 49% and compare
its PLTs in various mobile and wired network conditions respectively. Our results
show that rewriting 3P URLs for webpages with such high 3PTR values result
in signiﬁcantly lower PLTs compared to original page. For example, under Fair
mobile conditions, the median PLT and the 3PTR is reduced by 28% by rewriting
URLs of 3P assets on the webpage critical path. Additionally, in a last-mile wired
network with E2E latency of 20 ms (typical latency between clients and CDN
providers), we observe that the median PLT and the 3PTR with rewritten 3P
URLs is 24% lower than original webpages.
