I've seen that v1.11 will be introducing aliases for different histogram
binning optimization methods. I'm really looking forward to this feature, so
thank you for implementing this!
My question is how these methods will interact with the range parameter (this
is not currently documented).
  * If the range is within (min, max), I imagine that the data sent to the binning method is restricted to this range.
  * If the range is extends beyond (min, max), I am not sure how this would be handled. Will methods that return a binwidth fill the entire range according to this binwidth? And will methods that return a number of bins be forced to expand their binwidth to cover the full range?
