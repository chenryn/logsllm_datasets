### Is there an existing issue for this?
  * I have searched the existing issues
### Current Behavior
I run `npm version` and no commit or tag is created. I am not using `--no-git-
tag-version`. F.e. just `npm version major -m "..."`.
Under what conditions does `npm version` avoid creating a commit and tag?
### Expected Behavior
Always commit and tag unless I specify not to.
### Steps To Reproduce
    git clone https://github.com/lume/lume.git
    cd lume/packages/lume
    npm version major -m "v%s" --ignore-scripts
After this, you will see that `package.json` was updated, but no commit or tag
was created.
### Environment
  * OS: Linux
  * Node: 14.16
  * npm: 7.10
