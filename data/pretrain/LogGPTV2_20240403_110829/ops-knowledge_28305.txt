User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题SVN Corrupted, need to move with history We have had a problem with out svn repo, it contains everything so is extremely important.

When we ran a dump we would get the error message

svnadmin: E200002: Serialized hash malformed

This is preventing us from performing a dump and moving our content, it also failed on a svn export.

We have found that one of the revisions is corrupt, is there anyway we can fix or repair a repository as we need to move it.

Assistant: This worked for me. I have just repaired corrupted file db/revprops/19. 19 here is the version of the corrupted commit. You can see which commit is corrupted by doing svn log.

This file should look like this:

K 10
svn:author
V 5
roman
K 8
svn:date
V 27
2010-06-05T16:53:51.953072Z
K 7
svn:log
V 0

END


I had to change this

K 6
svn:loo


to this:

K 7
svn:log


(7 here shows the length of the next line)
