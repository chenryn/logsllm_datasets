ABSTRACT
Recent advances in spectrum access technologies, such as
cognitive radios, have made spectrum sharing a viable op-
tion for addressing the spectrum shortage problem. How-
ever, these advances have also contributed to the increased
possibility of “hacked” or “rogue” radios causing harm to the
spectrum sharing ecosystem by causing signiﬁcant interfer-
ence to other wireless devices. One approach for countering
such threats is to employ a scheme that can be used by a
regulatory entity (e.g., FCC) to uniquely identify a trans-
mitter by authenticating its waveform. This enables the
regulatory entity to collect solid evidence of rogue transmis-
sions that can be used later during an adjudication process.
We coin the term Blind Transmitter Authentication (BTA)
to refer to this approach. Unlike in the existing techniques
for PHY-layer authentication, in BTA, the entity that is
authenticating the waveform is not the intended receiver.
Hence, it has to extract and decode the authentication sig-
nal “blindly” with little or no knowledge of the transmis-
sion parameters.
In this paper, we propose a novel BTA
scheme called Frequency oﬀset Embedding for Authenticat-
ing Transmitters (FEAT). FEAT embeds the authentication
information into the transmitted waveform by inserting an
intentional frequency oﬀset. Our results indicate that FEAT
is a practically viable approach and is very robust to harsh
channel conditions. Our evaluation of FEAT is based on the-
oretical bounds, simulations, and indoor experiments using
an actual implementation.

INTRODUCTION
In the shared spectrum access model, the secondary users
(i.e., users with secondary access priority) employ cognitive
radio and/or other advanced technologies to access the spec-
trum opportunistically [10]. Unlike legacy radios, these tech-
nologies enable a user to readily re-conﬁgure the transmis-
sion parameters, allowing for greater ﬂexibility, but such a
feature also increases the possibility of malicious or “rogue”
transmitters that pose a serious threat to other transmitters.
Here, a “rogue” transmitter is deﬁned as a non-compliant
transmitter that violates regulator-prescribed spectrum ac-
cess rules. One approach for deterring rogue transmissions
is for a regulator (e.g., FCC’s Enforcement Bureau) to have
the capability to uniquely identify or authenticate “rogue”
transmitters [22]. However, the regulator that is attempt-
ing to identify the non-compliant transmitter is not the in-
tended receiver. Hence, we refer to such a receiver as a
“blind receiver”. As the name implies, the blind receiver has
little, if any, knowledge about the communication parame-
ters needed to demodulate and decode the detected signal.
Hence, the blind receiver would need to carry out transmit-
ter authentication at the PHY-layer, where the least amount
of knowledge of the communication parameters is needed to
authenticate the transmitter. We coin the term Blind Trans-
mitter Authentication (BTA) to refer to the problem of au-
thenticating a transmitter by extracting its unique, identi-
ﬁable information from the received signal with little or no
knowledge of the transmission parameters.
For BTA to be a viable approach for spectrum access
enforcement, all transmitters should be mandated to em-
ploy a mechanism for embedding an authentication signal—
which contains the identity of the transmitter and possibly
a certiﬁcate of compliance (e.g., FCC Declaration of Con-
formity)—into the message signal (which contains the data
that the transmitter wants to send). Also, tamper resistance
techniques should be employed to prevent hackers from cir-
cumventing this embedding mechanism. In this paper, we
assume that such mechanisms are incorporated into each
radio used by a secondary user.
We want to emphasize that there are a few important
diﬀerences between BTA and the conventional PHY-layer
authentication problem [25, 32].
In the latter problem, it
is assumed that the receiver (that is authenticating the sig-
nal) has complete knowledge of the transmission parame-
ters, whereas in the former problem, the receiver is “blind”.
Moreover, most, if not all, of the PHY-layer authentication
schemes are designed to work when the received signal’s
signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) is suﬃciently
high—e.g., high enough to demodulate and decode the mes-
sage signal correctly. Because a blind receiver is not the “in-
tended” receiver, it may need to carry out BTA at a location
where the SINR is very low with signiﬁcant multipath fad-
ing. Conventional PHY-layer authentication schemes would
perform very poorly under such conditions. An ideal BTA
scheme satisﬁes three requirements: (1) It incurs minimal
overhead in terms of the message throughput and transmis-
sion power; (2) It enables a receiver to “blindly” extract the
authentication information from the signal with little or no
knowledge of the transmission parameters; and (3) Authen-
tication can be performed under very harsh conditions (i.e.,
low SINR and signiﬁcant multipath fading).
In this paper, we propose a BTA scheme called Frequency
oﬀset Embedding for Authenticating Transmitters (FEAT).
To the best of our knowledge, FEAT is the ﬁrst scheme that
satisﬁes the three requirements of an ideal BTA scheme.
FEAT modiﬁes the frequency oﬀset of each frame of the
message signal to embed the authentication signal into the
message signal. This is achieved in such a way that the
authentication signal does not interfere with the decoding
process of the message signal. Also, the authentication sig-
nal can be estimated at the blind receiver with only limited
knowledge about the transmission parameters by estimating
the frequency oﬀset of each frame.
This paper’s main contributions are summarized below.
• We have deﬁned the BTA problem, and described how
it diﬀers from the conventional PHY-layer authentica-
tion problem.
• We propose a BTA scheme called FEAT. We have
demonstrated that FEAT is the ﬁrst scheme that satis-
ﬁes all of the required criteria of an ideal BTA scheme.
According to our results, FEAT outperformed the ex-
isting PHY-layer authentication approaches in all of
the performance criteria that were considered.
• We have evaluated FEAT using simulation results and
theoretical analysis. In addition, we have veriﬁed the
validity of FEAT by carrying out experiments with an
actual implementation.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We provide
the related work in Section 2 and describe the technical back-
ground in Section 3. We discuss the proposed scheme in Sec-
tion 4 and analyze it in Section 5. We evaluate the proposed
scheme by comparing with the prior art in Section 6. We
discuss a prototype implementation of the proposed scheme
in Section 7. Section 8 concludes the paper by highlighting
the main contributions.
2. RELATED WORK
PHY-layer authentication schemes can be broadly divided
into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic approaches. The
schemes in the ﬁrst category utilize the transmitter-unique
“intrinsic” characteristics of the waveform as unique signa-
tures to authenticate/identify transmitters. They include
RF ﬁngerprinting, and electromagnetic signature identiﬁ-
cation [5, 8, 14, 27]. Although these intrinsic approaches
have been shown to work in controlled lab environments,
their sensitivity to factors—such as temperature changes,
channel conditions, and interference—limit their eﬃcacy in
real-world scenarios. The schemes in the second category

enable a transmitter to “extrinsically” embed an authenti-
cation signal (e.g., digital signature) in the message signal
and enable a receiver to extract it. Such schemes include
PHY-layer watermarking [7, 11, 13, 16] and transmitter au-
thentication [17, 20, 21, 25, 28, 29, 32]. On one hand, the
intrinsic approaches require the blind receiver to have only
a little knowledge about the transmission parameters to au-
thenticate the transmitter, but they are limited by their low
robustness against noise and security attacks [9]. On the
other hand, the extrinsic approaches can be made highly ro-
bust against noise and security threats, but they require the
blind receiver to have complete knowledge about the trans-
mission parameters. Hence, the authors in [31] propose an
authentication scheme in which the authentication signal is
embedded into the message signal extrinsically to modify
an intrinsic characteristic (cyclo-stationary signature) of the
message signal. This enables the blind receiver to decode the
authentication signal with high robustness with only a lit-
tle knowledge about the transmission parameters. However,
this scheme achieves authentication at the cost of loss in the
message throughput.
3. TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
3.1 Models and Assumptions
Network Model: We assume that Alice, Bob, Charlie,
Dave and Eve are ﬁve users which share the same wireless
medium, as shown in Figure 1. Alice intends to transmit
messages to Bob and Charlie via the wireless medium as
per the rules established for dynamic spectrum sharing. Al-
ice utilizes cyclic preﬁx based orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (CP-OFDM) for its message signals, but can
reconﬁgure its PHY-layer parameters as per the require-
ments for the wireless medium [26]. OFDM is an spectrum
eﬃcient modulation scheme used in high bit-rate wireless
communications, e.g., IEEE 802.11a. Alice conveys the in-
formation about these parameters to Bob as well as Charlie
so that they can demodulate and decode Alice’s message sig-
nal. Dave (a.k.a. “blind receiver”) represents a regulatory
entity that needs to authenticate Alice. Suppose Alice and
Dave have agreed on a keyed authentication scheme that
enables Dave to blindly authenticate the waveforms that he
receives from Alice. For this to work, we must require Alice’s
radio to embed an authentication signal into her message sig-
nal’s waveform using the agreed authentication scheme, and
Dave must have the capability to extract and decode the
authentication signal from the received signal. We assume
that tamper-resistance techniques are employed to deter ma-
Charlie (Unaware Receiver)Bob (Aware Receiver)Eve(Adversary)Dave(Blind Receiver)Alice(Transmitter)licious users from circumventing or altering the embedding
process carried out by Alice’s radio [19, 24, 30]. Bob (a.k.a.
“aware receiver”) has knowledge about the authentication
scheme and can decode the message signal as well as the
authentication signal from the received waveforms. Charlie
(a.k.a. “unaware receiver”) does not know the authentica-
tion scheme and cannot authenticate Alice’s waveforms, but
should be able to demodulate and decode Alice’s message
signal. Eve represents an adversary, and she is able to launch
various types of attacks against Alice, e.g., extracting iden-
tity of Alice from the authentication signal, tampering with
Alice’s message signals, impersonation attacks, and replay
attacks. We assume that Eve does not know the key used to
generate Alice’s authentication signal. More details on Eve
are provided in Section 3.2.
Channel Model: Dave receives signals from Alice and
Eve with low SINR and signiﬁcant multipath. Also, there
may be simultaneous transmissions from Alice and Eve on
the same spectrum band. This means that Dave may receive
signals from Alice and Eve at the same time. Hence, Dave
should be able to authenticate even when the SINR is below
0 dB. Usually, it is very diﬃcult for a receiver to decode the
message signal under such harsh channel conditions [1].
Knowledge at Dave: It is assumed that Dave is aware
of the fact that CP-OFDM is employed by Alice and Eve
to modulate the message signals. Dave also knows the cen-
ter frequency and the sampling frequency of their signals;
these parameters are typically standardized as part of an
air-interface standard [26].
3.2 Performance Criteria
We present a set of performance criteria which can be
used to evaluate BTA schemes. We will use them to evalu-
ate FEAT, and compare the performance of FEAT with the
prior art.
Overhead: Embedding the authentication signal in the
message signal requires applying changes to the message sig-
nal itself, and thus incurs some type of PHY-layer overhead
when a signal with authentication is compared to a signal
without authentication. Examples of such overhead include
drop in message throughput, increase in bandwidth, increase
in complexity of the transmitter (Alice) and aware receiver
(Bob), and degradation of error performance, i.e., bit error
rate (BER), of the message signal at the aware receiver.
Transparency: This criterion dictates that a BTA scheme
should embed the authentication signal into the message sig-
nal such that it enables the blind receiver (Dave) to extract
the authentication signal, while at the same time, enables
the unaware receiver (Charlie) to recover the message signal
without requiring the unaware receiver to change its demod-
ulation or decoding procedure. This criterion also quantiﬁes
the possible impact of the authentication scheme on the error
performance of the message signal at the unaware receiver.
Authentication Rate: The authentication rate is de-
ﬁned as the amount of authentication information (com-
puted in bits) that can be transmitted per second. The
authentication signal is embedded by altering the message
signal in a certain manner so that the blind receiver can
detect the alteration and use it to extract the authentica-
tion information. The rate at which the alteration can be
made determines the authentication rate. Usually, the mes-
sage rate (or message throughput) aﬀects the authentication
rate.
Robustness to Noise and Fading: This criterion de-
termines the authentication signal’s error performance at the
aware receiver and the blind receiver. Note that the blind
receiver should be able to extract the authentication signal
from the received signal even in harsh channel conditions
(i.e., very low SNR and signiﬁcant multipath).
Authentication of Concurrent Transmissions: This
criteria considers the feasibility of authentication of multi-
ple transmitters which are transmitting concurrently. This
means that if both, Alice and Eve, are transmitting on the
same spectrum band at the same time, Dave should be able
to uniquely extract the authentication signals corresponding
to Alice and Eve from the received signal. The concurrent
transmissions hamper the decoding of their authentication
signals in two ways—sample-by-sample interference and au-
thentication signature interference. Since an OFDM signal
is Gaussian in nature, sample-by-sample interference from
samples of one transmitter can be considered Gaussian noise
to the other transmitter. The authentication signature in-
