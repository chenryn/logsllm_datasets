React version: 18.2.0

  1. Create a component that renders `children` directly or wrapped by a fragment
  2. Programatically or using google in-page translate clear the component

`Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node': The node to be removed is not a
child of this node.`
There is a better title for this bug report I just can't think of it yet ðŸ˜…

## The current behavior
The page turns blank because the element to remove could not be found
## The expected behavior
Either ignore the element and try to continue, or re-render the first parent
node that _does_ exist
