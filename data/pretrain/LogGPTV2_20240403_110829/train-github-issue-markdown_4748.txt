**Current behavior**  
If you have two CSS classes containing the same attribute (e.g. color) and
apply them both to the same element with ngClass, the attribute value selected
seems indeterministic.
**Expected behavior**  
Applying CSS classes with the same attribute to an element with ngClass should
use the duplicated elements in a known order.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**  
http://plnkr.co/OOMWOL
In the above Plnkr, I have two CSS styles, one red (colour: red) and one green
(colour: green). Applying these styles to the same element, what colour should
the text be?
When red is used first, followed by green, the text is red. When green is
first, followed by red, the test is still green.
The expectations is that one style will take priority over another based on
the order it is applied using ngClass.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Applying event based styles which override previous styles within an element.
