an electro-optical sensor directed at a device’s power indicator
LED. Throughout this section, we consider 𝑠𝑛𝑑(𝑡) as the audio
played inside the target’s room by the speakers, 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) as the optical
signal obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power
indicator LED of a device, and 𝑠𝑛𝑑∗(𝑡) as the audio signal recovered
from 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) using OAT. OAT consists of the following stages:
Filtering Side Effects. As discussed in Section 4 and presented
in Fig. 5, there are factors which affect the optical signal 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) that
are not the result of the sound played 𝑠𝑛𝑑(𝑡) (e.g., peaks which are
added to the spectrum that are the result of the light frequency of
the power indicator LED and its harmonics - 100 Hz, 200 Hz, etc.).
We filter the light frequency and its harmonics (its first, second,
third, ... order harmonics) from 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) using notch/bandstop filters.
Downtuning. As discussed in Section 4 and presented in Fig. 6,
in some cases only the second order of the frequencies of the played
signal 𝑠𝑛𝑑(𝑡) appears in the optical signal 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡). As a result, the
recovered signal 𝑠𝑛𝑑∗(𝑡) is uptuned compared to the original signal
𝑠𝑛𝑑(𝑡) played by the speakers. This case requires the eavesdropper
to apply downtuning to the optical signal 𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) in order to recover
sound at the original pitch. Downtuning is a standard procedure in

transformation (OAT) on the recovered signal.
the area of sound processing used to play a song at a lower tone.
We implemented this procedure digitally according to [31].
Speech Enhancement. Speech enhancement is performed to
maximize the signal’s dynamic range before applying additional
filters. To do so, we normalize the signal by scaling the values of
𝑜𝑝𝑡(𝑡) to the range of [-1,1]
Denoising. This is the process of removing noise from a signal
to increase the SNR and optimize its quality. Various techniques
have been demonstrated to reduce noise, however we reduce noise
by applying spectral subtraction, an adaptive technique proposed
for denoising single channel speech [66].
Equalizer. As discussed in Section 4 and presented in Fig. 7, the
SNR obtained from some devices is unstable and decreases as a
function of the frequency. We use an equalizer in order to amplify
the response of weak frequencies by adjusting the balance between
frequency components within an electronic signal.
The techniques that enable OAT to recover audio signals from
the optical signals are extremely popular in the area of speech pro-
cessing; we used them for the following reasons: (1) the techniques
rely on a speech signal that is obtained from a single channel; if
eavesdroppers have the capability of sampling a device’s power
indicator LED using multiple sensors, thereby obtaining several
signals via multiple channels, other methods can also be applied to
recover an optimized signal, (2) these techniques do not require any
prior data collection to create a model; recent methods use learning-
based models (e.g., neural networks) to optimize the speech quality
in noisy channels, however such methods require a large amount
of data for the training phase in order to create robust models,
something eavesdroppers would likely prefer to avoid, and (3) the
techniques can be applied in real-time applications, so the optical
signal obtained can be converted to audio with minimal delay.
The influence of each step of the OAT on the recovered signal
when the transformation is used to recover an arbitrary sentence
is illustrated in Fig. 9. As can be seen, the raw optical signal is
very noisy. However, the application of speech enhancement and

denoising techniques significantly improves the SNR. The equalizer
is only used for fine-tuning.
6 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the Glowworm
attack in terms of its ability to recover speech from the power indi-
cator LED of various devices. We start by comparing Glowworm’s
performance to the performance of the visual microphone and Lam-
phone in a lab setup. Then, we test the influence of distance and
the sound volume on Glowworm’s performance when recovering
speech through an office’s transparent glass window/door.
The reader can assess the quality of the recovered sound visually
by analyzing the extracted spectrograms, qualitatively by listening
to the recovered audio signal online,1, 2 and quantitatively based
on metrics used by the audio processing community to compare a
recovered signal to its original signal: (1) Intelligibility - a measure of
the comprehensibility of speech in given conditions [4]. To measure
intelligibility, we used the metric suggested by [65] which results in
values between [0,1]. A higher intelligibility indicates better sound
quality. (2) Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) - a metric that captures how
closely the spectral shape of a recovered signal matches that of
the original clean signal [57]. A lower LLR indicates better sound
quality. (3) NIST-SNR - the speech-to-noise ratio, which is defined
as the logarithmic ratio between the estimated speech power and
noise power over 20 consecutive milliseconds. A higher NIST-SNR
indicates better sound quality.
We used the following equipment and configurations to recover
sound in the experiments conducted and described in this section:
a telescope (with a 20 cm lens diameter) was directed at the power
indicator LED of the device. We mounted an electro-optical sensor
(Thorlabs PDA100A2 [9]) to the telescope. The voltage was obtained
from the electro-optical sensor using a 24-bit ADC NI-9234 card

ter all year" are presented in Fig. 11. The intelligibility, LLR, and
NIST-SNR of the recovered signals are reported in Table 2. Compar-
ing these results to the results reported in the original Lamphone
[54] and visual microphone [24] studies on the same sentences, we
find that: (1) The average intelligibility of the speech recovered
from the power indicator LED of the speakers (by applying the
attack in a direct manner) is considered good/fair (according to
[4]), however the average intelligibility of the speech recovered
from the power indicator LED of the USB hub splitters (by applying
the attack in an indirect manner) is considered poor. The visual
microphone and Lamphone yield the same level of results in terms
of intelligibility, as their average intelligibility is also considered
good. (2) The average LLR of the speech recovered from the power
indicator LED of Winner speakers is 1.74, which is lower (better)
than Lamphone’s average LLR (1.8) but higher (worse) than the
visual microphone’s average LLR (1.53). The average LLR of the
other devices was higher (worse) than that of the visual microphone
and Lamphone. (3) The average NIST-SNR of the speech recovered
from the power indicator LED of the Logitech S120 speakers is 11.9,
which is higher (better) than Lamphone’s average LLR (9.6) but
lower (worse) than the visual microphone’s average LLR (24.5). The
average NIST-SNR of the other devices was lower (worse) than that
of the visual microphone and Lamphone.
We conclude that the quality of the speech recovered by Glow-
worm is highly dependant on the device that is tested. We note
that the Glowworm attack does not rely on the distance between
the sound source and a lightweight vibrating object, whereas the
results reported by Lamphone and the visual microphone are based
on experiments performed when a vibrating object was placed a
few centimeters from speakers. As a result, the quality of a signal
recovered using the Glowworm attack at a fixed distance is stable
and does not vary depending on the distance to nearby objects.
6.2 The Influence of Distance on Glowworm’s
Performance
Next, we evaluate the influence of distance on Glowworm’s perfor-
mance.
We evaluate Glowworm’s performance on the task of recovering
sound at the speech level of a typical virtual meeting: 70 dB. In
the following set of experiments we attempted to recover sound
from the power indicator LED of Winner speakers from various
distances. We placed the speakers on a desktop inside an office; the
eavesdropping equipment was located outside the office, behind
two closed clear glass doors. As a result, no sound from the speakers
was heard from the eavesdropper’s position.
The setup can be seen in Fig. 12.
First, we start by examining the influence of the sound level on
the SNR.
Experimental Setup: We created an audio file that consists of
various sine waves (120, 170, 220, .... 1970 Hz) and placed the eaves-
dropping equipment 15, 25, and 35 meters away from the speakers.
We played the audio file via the speakers at 70 dB, obtaining the
optical measurements. The electro-optical sensor was configured
for the highest gain level before saturation.

[8] and was processed in a LabVIEW script that we wrote. The
sampling frequency of the ADC was configured at 2 KHz. In the
remainder of this section we refer to this setup as the eavesdropping
equipment. The level of the played sound was measured using a
professional decibel meter.
6.1 Comparing Glowworm to the Visual
Microphone and Lamphone
First, we compare the performance of Glowworm to that of the
visual microphone [24] and Lamphone [54] using a similar ex-
perimental setup to the one used in the studies presenting those
techniques. In those studies, the recovery of six sentences from the
TIMIT repository [27] was demonstrated by playing the sentences
via speakers and analyzing the recovered speech in a lab setup.
We compare Glowworm’s performance when recovering the same
sentences from the power indicator LED of the four devices that
with the highest SNR in Table 1: Two types of speakers (Logitech
S120 and Winner speakers) and two types of USB hub splitters
(TP-Link UE330 and MIRACASE MHUB500).
Experimental Setup: We replicated the experimental setup used
in both the visual microphone [24] and Lamphone [54] studies
as follows: We placed the devices on a desktop inside a lab and
played the same six sentences from the TIMIT repository [27] that
were recovered by the visual microphone and Lamphone via the
speakers, at the same volume level used in the visual microphone
study (an average sound level of 95 dB). We note that the speakers
we used this research are not capable of producing speech at sound
levels higher than 85 dB, so we set the maximum sound level. In our
experiment, the eavesdropping equipment was placed 2.5 meters
from the devices, behind a closed door. Our experimental setup
is presented in Fig. 10. In this experiment, the performance of
the Glowworm attack was evaluated on the task of recovering
speech by applying the attack in a direct manner, obtaining optical
measurements from the power indicator LED of two speakers, and
in indirect manner, obtaining optical measurements from the power
indicator LED of two USB hub splitters.
Results: We recovered speech by applying OAT to the optical
measurements. The recovered audio signals are available online1
where they can be heard. The signals recovered by the power in-
dicator LED of the two speakers and USB hub splitters when we
