ksetup addkdc
Adds a Key Distribution Center (KDC) address for the given Kerberos realm
The mapping is stored in the registry, under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\Kerberos\Domains and the computer must be restarted before the new realm setting will be used.
Note
To deploy Kerberos realm configuration data to multiple computers, you must use the Security Configuration Template snap-in and policy distribution, explicitly on individual computers. You can't use this command.
Syntax
ksetup /addkdc  []
Parameters
Parameter
Description
Specifies the uppercase DNS name, such as CORP.CONTOSO.COM. This value also appears as the default realm when ksetup is run, and is the realm to which you want to add the other KDC.
Specifies the case-insensitive, fully-qualified domain name, such as mitkdc.contoso.com. If the KDC name is omitted, DNS will locate KDCs.
Examples
To configure a non-Windows KDC server and the realm that the workstation should use, type:
ksetup /addkdc CORP.CONTOSO.COM mitkdc.contoso.com
To set the local computer account password to p@sswrd1% on the same computer as in the previous example, and then to restart the computer, type:
ksetup /setcomputerpassword p@sswrd1%
To verify the default realm name for the computer or to verify that this command worked as intended, type:
ksetup
Check the registry to make sure the mapping occurred as intended.
