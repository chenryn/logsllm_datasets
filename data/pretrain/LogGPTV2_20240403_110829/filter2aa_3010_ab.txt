achieved. 
Since these rulers of Kuwait are traditional friends and allies of 
both the ruling family of Saudi Arabia, that of Abdul Aziz Ibn 
Saud and of the USA and allies - especially the UK of which Kuwait 
was a Protectorate until 1961 - this will be hard. All Kuwait 
still hold dear the memory of the USA and allies rescuing their 
country from the invasion by Iraq of August 1990. 
However, we should also keep in mind that before the Iraq invasion 
Kuwait was the most pro USSR country in the Gulf region, and was 
the portal for all Gulf states to stay in good contact with 
Russia. There is a historic background to our plan. 
Therefore Russia must be clever. We befriend Kuwait gently. Over 
time Russia takes her time. We support Kuwait whenever we can. 
At the same time we set into action maskirovka operations that 
will alienate Kuwait from her friends. These operations terminate 
with a crisis, at which point Russia steps in to rescue her 
friend, and new and close ally. D DAY. 
All of these operations must be clandestine in the true sense. 
They 
are 
covert. 
They 
will 
always 
be 
denied. 
‘Plausible 
deniability’ is essential in every action at every stage. As much 
as possible these operations will be carried out using IT hacking 
and deception. By that means deniability is more easily achieved. 
While as much activity as possible is cyber there will be a 
cocktail of hacking, cyber, misinformation and hard acts of 
violence. Such a cocktail will give the most effective result. 
Highlight of this color denotes those points in the attack to be 
carried out by hacker / cyber war ops. 
4. DAESH 
An IS splinter group will be brought in to being by us. Twenty to 
one hundred men will be a good strength. They will be part Kuwaiti 
and part Iraqi. On behalf of the Caliphate they claim money from 
Kuwait for oil stolen by Kuwait’s slant drilling across the Iraq 
border at the Rumaila field. 
This group also represents the dissenting interest of the 
stateless Bidoon people (150,000 or so … 10% of the Kuwaiti 
population). 
Russia will clandestinely set up, train, equip and sustain this 
splinter group. It will in fact exist, albeit very small. 
The group will wage cyber war against Kuwait, although this will 
always be kept in check. We do not want to show our hand too 
early. 
Some terrorist actions of this group will be real. They will be up 
to IS’s high standards of nastiness. The operations of this group 
build slowly, leading in to the crisis ... thence to D DAY. 
This splinter group will be penetrated by Kuwait intelligence. 
This penetration will be achieved by a number of means: spies and 
technical 
intercept. 
However, this penetration will be fake, a maskirovka, set up by 
us, Russia, and by the splinter group itself. 
The fake intelligence that will come out of the IS splinter group 
will slowly build a false picture that the group is strongly 
backed by Saudi Arabia. That Saudi Arabia are in fact attacking 
Kuwait. 
5. MISRULE: Misfortune, incompetence, corruption and mis-rule 
Misfortune, incompetence, corruption and mis-rule. In the process 
Kuwait are robbed and defrauded of Billions of US $ worth of money 
and oil. This is achieved by offshore and implicating $$ transfers 
from private and commercial banks. 
These actions will be undertaken by our own cyber / hacking teams, 
but they will be made to look like the work of the Saudi backed IS 
splinter group described above. 
The actions of this sub-operation will build slowly, leading into 
the crisis and then D DAY. 
6. POISONED INTELLIGENCE 
We, Russia, will feed into the Kuwait Intelligence Service an 
intelligence circuit that penetrates Iran’s Intelligence service 
and military. This will be high level and of great value. Kuwait 
will feed it to the Saudi’s. 
At the right time - as the crisis and D DAY come closer - the 
Saudi’s discover that this intelligence circuit is a dangerous 
fake, and that the Kuwaiti’s must have known that. 
7. THIEVES: oil & oil revenue stolen from Saudi Arabia and Iraq 
The theft of oil and oil revenue from Saudi Arabia and Iraq by any 
possible means will be carried out in such a way that it must be 
Kuwait doing the stealing. 
This will primarily be a hacking operation. The blame will be laid 
to the door of Kuwait. 
8. FALSE CYBER: acts of cyber warfare against Saudi Arabia and 
Iraq 
These will be carried out by our Russian teams but they will be 
clumsy, and leave the traces of their being the work of Kuwait. 
8. SPIRAL 
This downward spiral - leading into civil war and mutiny - that 
coordinates with but is not a part of the IS splinter group 
activities. 
- setting up of NGO’s in Kuwait and overseas that demand human and 
civil rights etc etc for Kuwait 
- there is as a result civil disorder. This disorder builds. At all 
times paid agitators raise the temperature of such actions 
- false flag operations on social media and the internet as a whole 
intensify 
emotions 
and 
manipulate 
the 
situation 
- Kuwait Security Forces (KSF) over react. This is ensured by 
having paid agitators amongst the KSF 
- over reaction sparks further action, and that brings about 
terrible 
over 
reaction 
once 
more 
… 
the 
downward 
spiral 
accelerates … civil insurrection is now rampant 
- as background to this civil insurrection there are border and 
terrorist incidents. There is insurgency and terrorism. There are 
acts 
of 
sabotage, 
actual 
and 
virtual 
- at some point there is a mutiny of KSF 
- mutiny is suppressed by other parts of KSF and thus civil war has 
begun. Of course, within both parts of the KSF in this fight 
there are paid agitators. They are there to ensure we achieve 
what we want 
- the losing part of KSF in this civil war will be that part which 
the world has been led to believe are the ‘good’ part 
- their requests for assistance, will lead to the welcome 
assistance of Russian, when it comes 
The above subordinate operations [DAESH - MISRULE - POISONED 
INTELLIGENCE - THIEVES - FALSE CYBER] all contribute to SPIRAL. 
They build slowly, then combine to create the D DAY brought about 
at the end of SPIRAL. 
9. D DAY 
SPIRAL leads to and ends with D DAY. The other subordinate 
operations have also slowly built to this point. 
Just at the moment that the civil war between the two different 
parts of KSF - the mutineers and the mutiny suppressors - has 
become serious, and the world sees what is at stake, then the 
crisis is there. It is D DAY. 
- shut down all communications, internal and external, civil and 
government. 
- shut all phone exchanges, cell phone masts and switches, 
international voice and data gateways 
- shut all internet and ‘bomb out’ all computers 
- shut down all radio, TV and press 
- close airport, ATC and airspace 
- close port and sea movements 
- close banks (domestic & international), ATM’s, credit 
transaction, on line banking etc 
- shut power generation so that there is no electricity or natural 
gas supply 
- sabotage high tension power lines and drain transformers of 
cooling oil 
- close down all petrol stations 
- close public water supply 
- close traffic management computers 
10. DESIGNATE  
This sub-operation is concerned with the selection and preparation 
of a new Head of State and his supporting Ministers and staff. 
Factors that must be taken into account here include the 
following. That there is a tribal connection to Iran that crossed 
the Sunni divide Shia. It should be possible to find such a person 
who is or becomes a full Russian agent. 
11. POST 
This sub-operation is concerned with the ways in which our power 
over Kuwait is to be exercised once the above operations have 
taken place and Russia is in charge.
