**Issue: Unable to Launch Embedded Terminal in PyCharm Edu 3.0**

I recently installed **PyCharm Edu 3.0** and **Anaconda 3** on an older laptop. I am trying to access the embedded terminal within the IDE, but I am unable to launch it.

After researching similar issues here and reviewing JetBrains' documentation, I found that a common solution is to install the "Terminal" plugin. However, this plugin is not available for my version of PyCharm, and I have been unable to locate it in either the JetBrains plugin list or community repositories.

If anyone has encountered this issue before or can provide guidance on what I might be doing wrong, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

**Assistant's Response:**

To resolve the issue, follow these steps:

1. Open **Preferences** (or **Settings** on Windows/Linux).
2. Navigate to the **Plugins** section.
3. Click on **Marketplace** and search for **"Command Line Tool Support"**.
4. Install the **"Command Line Tool Support"** plugin.
5. Restart PyCharm if prompted.

This should enable you to use the terminal within PyCharm. I hope this helps!
