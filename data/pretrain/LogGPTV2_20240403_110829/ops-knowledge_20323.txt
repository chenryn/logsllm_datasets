User: First time posting, let me know how I can improve my questions.
I have installed PyCharm Edu 3.0 and Anaconda 3 on an older laptop. I am attempting to access the embedded terminal in the IDE and I am unable to launch it.
I have searched through similar questions here and the JetBrains docs, and the common knowledge seems to be installing the "Terminal" Plugin. My version of PyCharm does not have this plugin, and I am unable to find it in the JetBrains plugin list or community repositories.
If anyone has experienced this before or knows where I am going wrong attempting to launch the terminal I would appreciate the feedback.
Assistant: Click preferences and choose plugin. Next click install Jetbrains plugin and choose Command line Tool Support. I hope this will help you
