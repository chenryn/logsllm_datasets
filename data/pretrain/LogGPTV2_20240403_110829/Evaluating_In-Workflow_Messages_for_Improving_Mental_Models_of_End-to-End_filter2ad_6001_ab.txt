formation can be useful to certain users when kept brief
and focused on conﬁdentiality [9]. As there is no consen-
sus about the “best” metaphor, we adopted the key-lock
metaphor [9, 60].
• Endpoint weakness. Several real-world privacy breaches
have demonstrated the endpoint weakness of e2e encrypted
systems [1, 16, 70]. Our prior research indicates that users
found weaknesses of e2e encryption to be important [9].
We aim to convey that e2e encryption can’t protect against
adversaries who have endpoint access, e.g., by installing
malware or possessing an unlocked phone.
• Metadata weakness. Metadata weaknesses rarely receive
attention in e2e encrypted application descriptions and
were not emphasized in our prior work; however, we think
conveying metadata risks is an important piece of a strong
functional model of e2e encryption. We aim to convey that
adversaries who cannot access message content may still
have access to metadata or infer that a user is communicat-
ing using TextLight.
As our goal is to develop messages for integration into
existing app workﬂows, we consider three message lengths
that could ﬁt into workﬂows in diﬀerent ways:
• Short. Designed to ﬁt as an extra message within a chat
window (similar to the WhatsApp notiﬁcation that a chat is
e2e encrypted), or ﬁt on a splash screen or interstitial within
an app. We designed ﬁve Short messages, one for each of
the principles described above. (Hereafter, we reference
them as s.[principle], named for the principles they em-
body; for example, s.endpt is a short message referencing
endpoint weaknesses.)
• Medium. Designed to ﬁt in a popup message if a user
clicks on a short message to learn more, or to be included
in a summary displayed in an app store. We designed two
Medium messages, each of which includes four of the ﬁve
principles. We left out principles that appeared least eﬀec-
tive during pilots (see Section 3.4). We refer to these as m1
(leaves out conﬁdentiality) and m2 (leaves out endpoints).
• Long. Designed to be shown on an app’s website, or when
a user wants to seek out more detailed information. We
designed one Long message that includes all ﬁve principles;
key phrases are highlighted.
In order to accurately measure changes in mental models,
we also tested one Control message. This message, adapted
from a Telegram description, describes TextLight but does
not mention any privacy or security features [58].
Each participant viewed exactly one of these nine messages.
The message text is given in Appendix A. More detail about
how these messages were derived from our prior work is given
in Appendix C.
3.3 Data analysis
Our main analysis goal is to measure the eﬀectiveness of the
designed educational messages (especially with respect to
control message) in changing mental models of e2e encryp-
tion. As such, our main unit of analysis is the diﬀerence in
response to each statement in the communications privacy
questionnaire (Table 1), calculated by converting the Likert
responses to numeric values 1-5 and subtracting each pre-
intervention response from the associated post-intervention
response.
Grouping questions
To increase reliability of our mental
model measurement [28], and to reduce redundant statisti-
cal testing on potentially highly correlated questions in the
communications privacy questionnaire, we attempt to com-
bine questions about related adversaries and/or capabilities
(groupings shown in Table 1). We consider score diﬀerences
from participants who saw the Long message and use Cron-
bach’s α to test whether questions are correlated. If grouping
succeeds (α > .8, considered “good” [28]), we average diﬀer-
ences across questions in the group to create a single overall
diﬀerence score.
Attempting to create three adversary groups based on our
predeﬁned categories did not yield good internal consistency.
However, combining the read, change, and impersonate ca-
pabilities for each adversary did achieve good consistency,4
so we group these questions as the ensemble interception
capability.5 This results in six adversaries with three capabili-
ties each (a 40% reduction in statistical testing): interception,
metadata, and not-e2e encryption.
Comparing educational messages We employ the fol-
lowing strategy to further reduce unnecessary statistical test-
ing: For each question (or group of combined questions), we
4α’s are 0.82, 0.84, 0.92, 0.90, 0.92, and 0.90 for Employee, ISP, Server
hacker, Government, Unlocked phone, and Malware adversaries respectively.
5 For the Unlocked-Phone adversary, we group only read and impersonate,
as changing messages does not make much sense for this adversary.

(1) calculate the Kruskal Wallis omnibus (KW) test with dif-
ference scores as dependent variable and the nine message
versions as independent variables. If the KW is signiﬁcant, we
(2) use a two-tailed pairwise Mann-Whitney-U test (MWU)
to compare diﬀerence scores between Long (our best attempt
at explaining e2e encryption) and Control. This comparison
indicates whether our messaging is better than no messaging.
If this comparison is signiﬁcant, we investigate the remain-
ing message versions by (3) computing pairwise MWU’s
between Long and all other versions, as well as between Con-
trol and all other versions. We adjust the resulting p-values for
multiple comparison with Holm-Bonferroni correction [32].
We report eﬀect sizes using location-shift estimates [31],
which roughly approximate the diﬀerence (in Likert-scale
points) between the pre- and post-intervention scores. We use
a signiﬁcance level of α ≤ 0.05 for all statistical tests.
3.4 Pilot studies
We ran two pilot studies prior to the deployment of our survey.
We used an initial (partially in-person, pre-COVID-19) pilot
with 16 people, recruited through friends and acquaintances,
to reﬁne the survey structure and questions.
We used a second pilot on Proliﬁc (n=32), with Short mes-
sages only, to reﬁne and validate the survey questions and
ﬂow. In addition, results from this pilot informed the choice
of principles to include in the Medium messages.
3.5 Limitations
Our controlled experiment provides high internal validity. It
approximates a best-case scenario, in which participants are
directly instructed to pay attention to the educational message
and then asked about it immediately afterward. This allows
us to compare messages to each other; however, it does not
eﬀectively capture how we expect people to encounter mes-
sages in the real world. We use the app study (Section 5) to
test the messages with greater ecological validity.
As with similar online studies, our experiment is likely af-
fected by sampling and demand eﬀects. For convenience, and
to reduce variability, we limit our sample to the U.S. Typically
for Proliﬁc, our sample is not entirely representative of the
U.S. population. These limitations reduce generalizability to
broader classes of messaging app users.
Demand eﬀects — in which participants report what they
think the researchers want to hear — could aﬀect participants’
answers, but in this case responding “correctly” indicates the
participant has likely learned something. Further, the com-
munications privacy questionnaire might be aﬀecting mental
models by prompting users to think critically about e2e en-
cryption. We mitigate this by comparing our experimental
groups to a control message. All of these limitations are con-
sistent across conditions, enabling comparison.
Finally, non-parametric statistical tests such as those we
use are most appropriate for Likert-type questions, but they
have less power than their parametric counterparts, meaning
that we may fail to ﬁnd evidence for small eﬀects.
4 Survey Study: Results
We next detail the results of the survey study.
4.1 Participants
In September 2019, we used Proliﬁc to recruit 578 U.S.
residents who do not have programming skills (a proxy
for tech-savviness). We discarded 76 participants (13.1%)
who reported being comfortable with explaining (“agree” or
“strongly agree”) end-to-end or symmetric-key encryption.
To ensure data quality, we also discarded responses from 12
participants who gave unrelated or nonsensical answers to
free-response questions (2.1%). For ease of analysis, we dis-
carded responses from any participant who did not answer all
communications privacy questionnaire questions in both the
pre- and post-intervention questionnaires (n=29, 5.0%). We
analyze responses from the remaining 461 participants. Partic-
ipants were randomly distributed among message conditions,
with twice as many participants allocated to the Long condi-
tion because we used it as a basis for our preliminary analysis.
After ﬁltering, the Long condition had 92 participants; the
other eight conditions had between 42 and 52 each.
On average, participants took just under 10 minutes to com-
plete the study and were compensated $2.00, for an average
wage of $12.16/hour.
Table 2 details our participants’ demographics. As ex-
pected, the sample is younger, whiter, more Asian, and more
educated than the U.S. population,6 but it does capture a broad
range of demographics.
4.2 Comparing message versions
We ﬁnd that the educational messages work signiﬁcantly bet-
ter than Control with many adversary-capability pairs. Specif-
ically, Long works best against Control overall, Medium is
similar, and Short messages are particularly eﬀective in con-
veying speciﬁc points. However, many participants already
had accurate mental models for some aspects of e2e encryp-
tion, resulting in no improvement, and we ﬁnd evidence some
of the Short messages may oversell e2e encryption.
We expect participants to learn that Employee, ISP, Gov-
ernment, and Server Hacker adversaries are less capable of
interception attacks (negative diﬀerence scores), while the
endpoint adversaries Unlocked Phone and Malware are more

capable of interception attacks (positive). We expect all adver-
saries to be perceived as more capable (positive) of metadata
and not-e2e encryption attacks.
Signiﬁcant results from our condition comparisons are
shown in Table 3. We show the distribution of the diﬀer-
ences for each adversary-capability pair using violin plots.
For additional context, we also plot pre- and post-intervention
Likert responses for each. Plots for selected pairs are shown
in Figure 1; all plots are available in the extended paper (see
Appendix D).
4.2.1 Long is often better than control
Long performs better than Control for several adversary-
capability pairs (MWU, p ≤ 0.05), including the Employee,
ISP, Government, and Malware interception capabilities, as
well as the ISP metadata capability. The location-shift esti-
mates — that is, how much more eﬀective Long was than
Control, expressed in Likert points — range from 0.67 (inter-
ception capability of Malware, more capable) to -1 (intercep-
tion capability of Employee and Government, less capable).
4.2.2 Some models are already correct
The remaining adversary-capability pairs — Unlocked Phone
and Hacker interception, all non-ISP metadata, and all not-
e2e encryption — show no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between
Long and Control. Many, including all Unlocked Phone and
