### Information and Metaphors

Brief and focused information on confidentiality can be valuable to certain users [9]. Given the lack of consensus on the "best" metaphor, we adopted the key-lock metaphor [9, 60].

### Endpoint Weakness

Several real-world privacy breaches have highlighted the endpoint weakness in end-to-end (e2e) encrypted systems [1, 16, 70]. Our prior research indicates that users consider the weaknesses of e2e encryption to be significant [9]. We aim to convey that e2e encryption cannot protect against adversaries who gain access to endpoints, such as by installing malware or possessing an unlocked phone.

### Metadata Weakness

Metadata weaknesses are often overlooked in descriptions of e2e encrypted applications and were not emphasized in our prior work. However, conveying metadata risks is crucial for a strong functional model of e2e encryption. We aim to communicate that adversaries who cannot access message content may still access metadata or infer that a user is communicating using TextLight.

### Message Lengths

To integrate these messages into existing app workflows, we designed three message lengths:

- **Short**: Designed to fit as an extra message within a chat window (similar to the WhatsApp notification that a chat is e2e encrypted) or on a splash screen. We created five short messages, one for each principle described above (e.g., s.endpt for endpoint weaknesses).
- **Medium**: Designed to fit in a popup message if a user clicks on a short message to learn more, or to be included in a summary displayed in an app store. We designed two medium messages, each including four of the five principles. The least effective principles during pilots were omitted (see Section 3.4). These are referred to as m1 (omits confidentiality) and m2 (omits endpoints).
- **Long**: Designed to be shown on an app’s website or when a user seeks detailed information. We created one long message that includes all five principles, with key phrases highlighted.

### Control Message

To accurately measure changes in mental models, we also tested a control message. This message, adapted from a Telegram description, describes TextLight but does not mention any privacy or security features [58]. Each participant viewed exactly one of these nine messages. The message text is provided in Appendix A, and more details on how these messages were derived from our prior work are in Appendix C.

### Data Analysis

Our primary goal is to measure the effectiveness of the designed educational messages in changing mental models of e2e encryption, especially compared to the control message. We analyze the difference in responses to each statement in the communications privacy questionnaire (Table 1) by converting Likert responses to numeric values (1-5) and subtracting pre-intervention responses from post-intervention responses.

#### Grouping Questions

To increase the reliability of our mental model measurement and reduce redundant statistical testing, we attempt to combine questions about related adversaries and/or capabilities (groupings shown in Table 1). We use Cronbach’s α to test the correlation of questions. If grouping succeeds (α > .8, considered “good” [28]), we average differences across questions in the group to create a single overall difference score.

Combining the read, change, and impersonate capabilities for each adversary achieved good consistency, resulting in six adversaries with three capabilities each: interception, metadata, and not-e2e encryption.

#### Comparing Educational Messages

We employ the following strategy to further reduce unnecessary statistical testing:
1. Calculate the Kruskal-Wallis omnibus (KW) test with difference scores as the dependent variable and the nine message versions as independent variables.
2. If the KW is significant, use a two-tailed pairwise Mann-Whitney-U test (MWU) to compare difference scores between Long and Control.
3. If this comparison is significant, compute pairwise MWUs between Long and all other versions, as well as between Control and all other versions, adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons with Holm-Bonferroni correction [32].

We report effect sizes using location-shift estimates, which approximate the difference in Likert-scale points between pre- and post-intervention scores. We use a significance level of α ≤ 0.05 for all statistical tests.

### Pilot Studies

We conducted two pilot studies before deploying our survey:
1. An initial pilot (partially in-person, pre-COVID-19) with 16 people, recruited through friends and acquaintances, to refine the survey structure and questions.
2. A second pilot on Prolific (n=32), with short messages only, to refine and validate the survey questions and flow. Results from this pilot informed the choice of principles to include in the medium messages.

### Limitations

Our controlled experiment provides high internal validity, approximating a best-case scenario where participants are directly instructed to pay attention to the educational message and then asked about it immediately afterward. This allows us to compare messages; however, it does not capture how people might encounter messages in the real world. We use the app study (Section 5) to test the messages with greater ecological validity.

As with similar online studies, our experiment is likely affected by sampling and demand effects. For convenience and to reduce variability, we limit our sample to the U.S. Typically, our sample is not entirely representative of the U.S. population, reducing generalizability to broader classes of messaging app users.

Demand effects, where participants report what they think researchers want to hear, could affect answers. However, responding "correctly" indicates the participant has likely learned something. The communications privacy questionnaire might prompt users to think critically about e2e encryption, mitigated by comparing experimental groups to a control message. Non-parametric statistical tests, while appropriate for Likert-type questions, have less power than parametric counterparts, meaning small effects may go undetected.

### Survey Study: Results

#### Participants

In September 2019, we used Prolific to recruit 578 U.S. residents without programming skills. We discarded 76 participants (13.1%) who reported being comfortable explaining end-to-end or symmetric-key encryption. To ensure data quality, we also discarded responses from 12 participants who gave unrelated or nonsensical answers to free-response questions (2.1%). Additionally, we discarded responses from participants who did not answer all communications privacy questionnaire questions in both the pre- and post-intervention questionnaires (n=29, 5.0%). We analyze responses from the remaining 461 participants, randomly distributed among message conditions, with twice as many participants allocated to the Long condition for preliminary analysis. After filtering, the Long condition had 92 participants; the other eight conditions had between 42 and 52 each.

Participants took just under 10 minutes to complete the study and were compensated $2.00, for an average wage of $12.16/hour. Table 2 details our participants' demographics, which are younger, whiter, more Asian, and more educated than the U.S. population, but still capture a broad range of demographics.

#### Comparing Message Versions

We find that the educational messages work significantly better than the control with many adversary-capability pairs. Specifically, Long works best overall, Medium is similar, and Short messages are particularly effective in conveying specific points. However, many participants already had accurate mental models for some aspects of e2e encryption, resulting in no improvement, and some Short messages may oversell e2e encryption.

We expect participants to learn that Employee, ISP, Government, and Server Hacker adversaries are less capable of interception attacks (negative difference scores), while the endpoint adversaries Unlocked Phone and Malware are more capable of interception attacks (positive). We also expect all adversaries to be perceived as more capable of metadata and not-e2e encryption attacks.

Significant results from our condition comparisons are shown in Table 3, with violin plots and pre- and post-intervention Likert responses for additional context. Plots for selected pairs are shown in Figure 1, with all plots available in the extended paper (Appendix D).

#### Long is Often Better Than Control

Long performs better than Control for several adversary-capability pairs (MWU, p ≤ 0.05), including the Employee, ISP, Government, and Malware interception capabilities, as well as the ISP metadata capability. Location-shift estimates range from 0.67 (interception capability of Malware, more capable) to -1 (interception capability of Employee and Government, less capable).

#### Some Models Are Already Correct

The remaining adversary-capability pairs, including Unlocked Phone and Hacker interception, all non-ISP metadata, and all not-e2e encryption, show no significant difference between Long and Control. Many, including all Unlocked Phone and Hacker interception, already had accurate mental models.
