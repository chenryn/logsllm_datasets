User: How do I set up Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and access a Windows server remotely?
Assistant: To set up Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and access your Windows server remotely, follow these steps: 1. Open the Control Panel on your Windows server and go to System and Security > System > Remote Setup. 2. On the Remote tab, make sure the Allow remote connections to this computer option is enabled. If you need Remote Assistance Services or Remote Desktop Services to manage this computer, you can set them up here. Also keep an eye on selected users. 3. List users who can enable this service. So the account name needs to be added there 4. Before you can access the Windows server via Remote Desktop, the RDP protocol must be added to the allow list of the Windows Firewall. You can use the following command: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group="remote desktop" new enable=yes 5. Confirm that the remote desktop connection client has been installed on your Windows server. If you are using Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, you can search for "Remote Desktop Connection" in the start menu and click to open it. If you are connecting to a Windows Server 2012 or earlier version of Windows server, you may need to manually download and install the Remote Desktop Connection client. 6. Open the remote desktop connection client and enter the IP address or domain name of the Windows server. Enter the credentials you want to use to remotely access the Windows server in Username. 7. Click the "Connect" button, then enter the password and log in to the Windows server. You have now successfully set up Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and remotely accessing your Windows server.
