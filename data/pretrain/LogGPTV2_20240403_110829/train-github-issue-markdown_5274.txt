Pls. provide [GitHub address] to reproduce this issue.  
https://github.com/abelli85/meterEff/blob/master/meff/src/test/kotlin/com/abel/bigwater/impl/CodeServiceImplTest.kt
### Expected Result
configuration for dubbo-rest via servlet:
    <dubbo:protocol name="rest" port="8080" threads="500" contextpath="meff" server="servlet" accepts="500"
    ...
here's junit test class:
    // create junit test class with annotation
    @ContextConfiguration(locations = ["classpath:/spring/rest-provider.xml", "classpath:/spring-mybatis.xml"])
    @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner::class)
    class CodeServiceImplTest {
      @Test
      fun test1() {
        // ...
      }
      @Test
      fun test2() {
        //...
      }
    ...
What do you expected from the above stepsï¼Ÿ  
all junit tests including the first SHOULD run fine.
### Actual Result
What actually happens?  
the first junit test in the list always FAILS.
If there is an exception, please attach the exception trace:
    Just put your stack trace here!
    Caused by: org.apache.dubbo.rpc.RpcException: No servlet context found. If you are using server='servlet', make sure that you've configured org.apache.dubbo.remoting.http.servlet.BootstrapListener in web.xml
    	at org.apache.dubbo.rpc.protocol.rest.DubboHttpProtocolServer.doStart(DubboHttpProtocolServer.java:62)
### Comments:
seems that **web.xml** is loaded lazily during junit tests, so first junit
test fails.
