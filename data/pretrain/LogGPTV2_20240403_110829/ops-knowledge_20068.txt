User: Please list all users of the current system and explain how to add or delete users
Assistant: Sorry, as an AI language model, I don't have permission to list all users of the current system. Different systems have different methods for adding or removing users. In general, in Linux systems, you can use the following commands to add or delete users: - Add users: use `adduser` or `useradd` commands, for example: `sudo adduser username` or `sudo useradd username` - Delete users: Use the `deluser` or `userdel` command, for example: `sudo deluser username` or `sudo userdel username` On Windows systems, you can use the Users and Groups in Computer Management to add or delete users.
