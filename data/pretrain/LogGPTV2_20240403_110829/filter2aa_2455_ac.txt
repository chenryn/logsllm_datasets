Communications
Computer based
• Make data logging trail one sided and stay 
dynamic (e-mail, IP addresses)
• Shred, overwrite, delete
• Ensure backups don’t copy off data
• Ensure data destroyed on backups too!
• Encrypt e-mail. Yes, it takes time. 
• Chat? Go encrypted with Trillian or IRC.
• Use lots of e-mail addresses, or at least 
aliases for inbound e-mail.

Education
K-12
• Consider home schooling as an option. Or private 
schools offer another choice.
• K-12 is hardest to deal with, to enroll in school district, 
an actual address must be presented. Does school 
need information about where parents work, multiple 
contact numbers? Need to weigh tradeoff when child 
gets sick in school. What’s practical? What’s required?
• Minimize information given to school. Getting your 
children to understand this is tough.
• Insist, in writing, school not disclose personal 
information, especially true for high school students 
(schools giving information to colleges). 
• Watch out with handing information out for SAT/ACT.

Education
College and beyond
• Need based scholarships, worth the “cost”?
• Living on campus has its pros (easier judicial 
system) and cons (loss of privacy per 
contract). 
• Roommates you don’t know.
• Using school systems for Internet access.
• Information theft even after leaving school; all 
your information is out there, and it’s still 
getting stolen. What is the colleges privacy 
policy; is there a track record of break-ins?

A visit to the doctor
How to limit information sharing
• For anything sensitive, go to a free clinic or a people’s 
clinic out of your local area. Use a different name, pay 
cash. Don’t give consent to share, not needed.
• Local health fairs for screening. Don’t visit the location 
down the street from where you live or work as you 
may see someone you know.
• Pay cash for treatment and prescriptions (why should 
your bank/credit card issuer know you’ve been seeing 
a someone at “The Baldness Clinic”)? 
• Go to a non-chain doctor & pharmacy in a non-
NASPER state (National All Schedule Prescriptions

Life Events
• Births, divorces and deaths are announced in newspaper

• Get married out of the area, don’t put announcement in 
the paper (sorry, mom).
• Hospitals sell records to all sorts of places, talk to them 
before being admitted.

Closing thoughts
“The fundamental human right of privacy in Canada is 
under assault as never before. Unless the government of 
Canada is quickly dissuaded from its present course by 
Parliamentary action and public insistence, we are on a 
path that may well lead to the permanent loss not only of 
privacy rights that we take for granted but also of important 
elements of freedom as we now know it.” 
George Radwanski, Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
