the attack distances in the MDF table are much smaller than
the other tables. However, the attack range on an MDF table
can be increased by using a more powerful ampliﬁer (in this
study, the amplitude of output is limited to 30V by the power
ampliﬁer). For both metal and glass tables, a successful attack
can be executed with a much larger table as evidenced in
Section VI-D. In summary, SurﬁngAttack can effectively attack
the devices placed on tables with different table materials,
especially metal and glass materials. The attack performance
improves when the table material matches the device’s body
material.
F.
Inﬂuences of Table Thickness
The surface materials of different tables may have different
thicknesses. In this experiment, we evaluate the inﬂuences
of different table thicknesses. We purchase different thick-
nesses of Aluminum sheets and glass sheets from McMaster-
Carr [34]. Speciﬁcally, Table VII lists the recognition rates
across different thicknesses of metal and glass tables for the
attack message “OK Google, read my message”. We present
the results with both 9V and 30V attack signal amplitudes. The
results with 9V attack signals show that the recognition rate of
the attack message degrades with increasing material thickness,
which matches with our theoretical analysis. With Aluminum
sheet, we ﬁnd that the recognition rate starts dropping when the
thickness increases to 1/4 inch. With 1/2 inch thick Aluminum
sheets, the attack becomes unsuccessful: the recorded sound
shows a signiﬁcant distortion of voice signals due to the
propagation complexity brought by the thick metal sheets.
However, with 30V attack signals, SurﬁngAttack succeeds with
100% rate even with the thickest 1.5 inch metal sheet.
In the glass material, we notice the same trend of de-
grading attack performance with increasing thickness under
9V attack signals. With 3/8 thick glasses, the recognition rate
of attack commands drops to 0%. However, with 30V attack
signals, SurﬁngAttack succeeds even with the thickest glass
table. Moreover, we have an interesting observation that, with
different thicknesses of materials, the best attack frequencies
fc are different. This can be attributed to the phase-velocity
dispersion of guided waves: as shown in Fig. 3, the propagation
of the guided wave becomes different with varied signal
frequencies and thicknesses, which leads to different attack
performance.
G. Impact of Interlayers and Objects on the Table
mediate layers between them, such as documents, newspapers,
tablecloths, and mobile phone cases, etc. When the incident
waves cross a layer sandwiched between two media, wave re-
ﬂection and wave propagation through an elastic layer depend
on the frequency and interlayer thickness, which are associated
with resonances in the layer [7]. In this study, we place Google
Pixel 25 cm away from the PZT transducer on the glass
table with various interlayers, and measure the attack success
rate with the command “OK Google, read my message”, the
results of which are shown in Table VIII. For each layer, we
repeat the command 20 times and calculate the average success
rate. SurﬁngAttack exhibits excellent performance with most
interlayers. However, the attack fails to penetrate the interlayer
made of a Peva front and non-woven backing tablecloth, since
the impedance mismatch is intensely increased by the non-
woven layer. In another experiment, we place arbitrary objects
on the table, the recognition performance of SurﬁngAttack on
different devices is unaffected.
Phone cases are popular accessories for hardware protec-
tion. We run an additional experiment to evaluate the impact of
phone cases (mostly made of silicone rubber) for four different
phones. The results in Table IX show that the recognition rates
are only slightly affected by the phone cases. However, we note
that the performance degradation could be more signiﬁcant,
if thicker phone cases made of uncommon materials such as
wood are used.
In summary, SurﬁngAttack can successfully attack devices
on the tables covered with most types of interlayers except for
some special types of tablecloths. Moreover, objects on the
table do not affect SurﬁngAttack.
VII. COUNTERMEASURE
In this section, we discuss the defense strategies to defend
against SurﬁngAttack.
Hardware Layout Enhancement. One prerequisite for the
success of the attack is that the ultrasonic voice commands can
propagate along the device body to the microphones. Thus,
the layout of microphone could be enhanced and redesigned
to damp or suppress any acoustic vibration whose frequencies
are in the ultrasound range.
Interlayer-based Defense. One effective but simple de-
fense mechanism of SurﬁngAttack is to place the device on a
soft woven fabric or a multilayers term (the peva & non-woven
two layers tablecloth in Table VIII) to increase the impedance
mismatch.
In a realistic scenario, the device may not be in direct
contact with the tabletop. There may exist one or more inter-
Software-based Defense. An ideal software-based defense
approach should identify and reject received voice commands

that are not the genuine voices by analyzing the unique features
of attack signals which are distinctive from the genuine ones.
Prior studies [52] have shown the difference between the
recovered ultrasound attack signal and the original signal
in the frequency ranging from 500 to 1,000 Hz. However,
with SurﬁngAttack, there is no signiﬁcant difference in that
frequency range between the genuine signal and ultrasonic
signal as shown in Fig. 17.

the recovered attack signal and the baseband signal at the
high frequency ranging from 5 kHz to 20 kHz, as shown in
Fig. 18. The original signal is produced by the Google TTS
engine with the carrier frequency for modulation as 25.7 kHz.
The recovered attack signal of SurﬁngAttack suppresses the
frequency components from 5 kHz to 8 kHz and produces
a new frequency component from 10 kHz to 20 kHz mainly
attributed to the complicated nonlinear response. Since human
voice mainly occupies low frequencies, most feature recogni-
tion algorithms for speech recognition (such as Mel-frequency
cepstral coefﬁcients or MFCCs) mostly focus on low frequency
features, while high frequency features take less weight. As a
result, even if the high frequency components of the signal are
distorted, the attack still sabotages many devices.
With such observation, we propose an attack index based
on the frequency response R(f ) of the received signal as
deﬁned below:
AttackIndex = log

Feedback. In order to avoid alerting the users, SurﬁngAttack
adjusts the victim phone’s volume to the lowest settings, which
also increases the difﬁculty of capturing the victim’s feedback
by a hidden tapping device. In the presence of signiﬁcant envi-
ronmental noise, it could be challenging to capture and recover
the weak feedback. However, a highly-sensitive tapping device
such as a parabolic microphone placed underneath the table
can be used to improve the feedback capture efﬁciency. We
can also apply signal processing techniques to separate out
the feedback from the noise.
Attack Speciﬁc Devices or Multiple Devices Simulta-
neously. Table I shows that different best attack frequencies
fc work for different mobile devices, which provides an
opportunity to attack a speciﬁc device in the presence of
multiple devices. For example, Xiaomi Mi 8 or Mi 8 Lite
is subject
to 25.5 KHz attack frequency, which is lower
than most of the other devices. An adversary could leverage
such a parameter difference for targeted attack. Meanwhile,
SurﬁngAttack could also attack multiple devices with similar
parameter settings simultaneously using non-interactive attack
commands, and we demonstrate such a multi-device attack on
the website. However, if some mobile devices have customized
wake-up words, SurﬁngAttack will not be able to activate them
simultaneously, but it offers another opportunity for launching
targeted attack when the attacker learns the speciﬁc wake-up
words.
Limitation of Voice Unlock. Unlocking the phone with
Google Assistant is as easy as speaking “OK Google”. How-
ever, we discover that after the Google Assistant upgrade in
March 2019, Google replaces the “voice unlock” with the “lock
screen personal results” function [21]. Equipped with this new
feature, the user can control what types of information the
Assistant will speak or show when the phone is locked. If the
victim happens to turn off lock screen personal results, the
attacker will need to unlock the device with ﬁngers to hear
Assistant’s responses that include personal information. If the
victim turns on this feature (which is often the case), the attack
still succeeds. Therefore, locking the device and turning off
lock screen personal results function could be one solution to
defend against SurﬁngAttack. Note that only the pattern, PIN
and password screen lock can counter SurﬁngAttack, while the
swipe screen lock could not. Moreover, the recent Android and
iOS systems allow users to disable the voice assistants on lock
screen, in which case SurﬁngAttack can be prevented as long
as users lock their device every time they put it down.
IX. RELATED WORK
Voice-based Attacks. With the rapidly growing popularity
and functionality of voice-driven IoT devices, voice-based
attacks have become a non-negligible security risk. Gong et
al. investigate and classify voice-based attacks [20] into four
major categories: basic voice replay attacks [12], [29], [36],
operating system level attacks [3], [15], [26], [53], machine
learning level attacks [2], [9], [10], [13], [19], [43], [48], [51],
and hardware level attacks [28], [52]. A machine learning level
attack uses adversarial audio commands to attack automatic
speech recognition (ASR) systems. The commands are intel-
ligible to ASR systems, but cannot be easily comprehended
by humans. A hardware level attack replays a synthetic non-
speech analog signal instead of human voice. For example,

(from ultrasound commands).
of identifying SurﬁngAttack, we generate 54 attacks with
different attack parameters (i.e., frequencies, table materials,
distances, baseband signals, devices). The attack indices of
both original signals and recovered signals are presented in
Fig. 19. By monitoring the attack index, we can effectively
detect SurﬁngAttack, since there are almost no such high
frequency components in the human voice. As such, if the
attack index is higher than a pre-set threshold, the received
voice signal would be classiﬁed as an attack. It is worth noting
that if the cut-off frequency of the audio low-pass ﬁlter in
the device is lower than 10 kHz (e.g., Xiaomi Mi 5), this
defense strategy may become invalid since the attack index
cannot be computed without the information of high frequency
components.
VIII. DISCUSSION
Attacking Standing Voice Assistants. Amazon Echo and
Google Home are standing voice assistants with microphones
distributed across the cylinder. The current SurﬁngAttack can-
not reach these microphones. We believe this is due to the
signiﬁcant power loss during the power transition across the
boundary of the table material and speaker material, as well
as the devices’ internal construction in terms of the relative
position of the microphones. With a better ampliﬁer, it could
be possible to excite high-power ultrasound signals to reach
the standing speakers’ microphones.
Short Attack Distance on MDF Table. As shown in
Table VI, the attack distance of MDF was signiﬁcantly shorter
than that of other table materials, which we believe can also
be improved by increasing signal power. With 1.5 W attack
power, SurﬁngAttack reaches the maximum attack distance of
50 cm on MDF material. To improve the effectiveness of
SurﬁngAttack, the adversary can attach multiple transducers
