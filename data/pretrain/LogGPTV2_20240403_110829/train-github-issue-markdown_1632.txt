I'm trying to create an application that registers events on key presses. The
registering works fine, and the events are triggered properly, but the
keypress isnt passed forwards onto the OS for any other program to process.  
Yes I'm using single character ('x' etc.), and obviously there are security
implications of this (no I'm not writing anything malicious), but it would
still be nice to be able to bind to keys and them still pass to other programs
on the OS.  
Any help would be great, sorta forgot to check this was possible before I
started developing the rest of it üëç
