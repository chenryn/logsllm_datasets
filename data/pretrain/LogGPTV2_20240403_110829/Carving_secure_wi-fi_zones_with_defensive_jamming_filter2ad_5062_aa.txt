ABSTRACT
With rampant deployment of wireless technologies such as
WLAN, information leakage is increasingly becoming a threat
for its serious adopters such as enterprises. Research on an-
tidotes has been mainly focused on logical measures such as
authentication protocols and secure channels, but an inside
collaborator can readily circumvent such defenses and wire-
lessly divert the classiﬁed information to a conniver outside.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the problem
that forges a walled wireless coverage, a secure Wi-Fi zone
in particular. Inspired by the fact that jamming as an attack
is inherently diﬃcult to defeat, we turn the table and use
it as a defensive weapon to fend oﬀ the covert illegal access
from outside. To validate the proposed approach, we con-
duct extensive outdoor experiments with the IEEE 802.11g
Wi-Fi adapters. The measurements show that the forged
secure zones match well with the model prediction and that
the defensive jamming approach can indeed be used to pro-
tect wireless networks against information leakage. Lastly,
we propose the algorithms to conﬁgure defensive jammers in
arbitrary geometry.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, wireless networks have made huge
progress in both diversity and volume. More novel solutions
are being added even today to satisfy the growing needs
for easy and ﬂexible connectivity. Although the ease and
ﬂexibility are the fortes of wireless technology, there is a
ﬂip side to it, which are the vulnerabilities arising from the

shared-medium communication. Among many, information
theft is quickly becoming a pressing issue, as more and more
enterprises adopt wireless technology for their business.
A variety of mechanisms has been proposed to prevent il-
legal access to conﬁdential data over wireless networks. The
diversity in term of time, frequency, space, code, etc. is used
in the physical layer to secure the communication channel
(e.g. spread spectrum). On the link layer, security proto-
cols are frequently adopted to authenticate the users and/or
encrypt sensitive data. For example, the most widely de-
ployed IEEE 802.11 WLAN includes an security protocol
extension such as IEEE 802.11i. Upper layer protocols like
IEEE 802.1x are also used.
Still, however, there have been many problems in coping
with the information theft with the aforementioned mecha-
nisms. Most of physical layer methods requires costly hard-
ware or complex techniques. In many widely deployed wire-
less protocols the secret key used for spreading techniques
is publicly revealed or possibly guessed by analyzing bea-
cons and frequency usage pattern. Moreover, what if the
keys used in the security protocols are exposed to unautho-
rized parties, or more importantly an insider makes an illegal
wireless connection to an outside AP?
Admittedly, it is not possible to have a complete solution
working in a single layer by the nature of the layered ar-
chitecture of current wireless protocols. In this paper, we
present a novel approach which can enhance the existing
security mechanisms to defend against information leakage
and can make the attacking cost expensive. Diﬀerent from
the traditional approach, we turn our attention to how to
isolate the speciﬁc geographical area from the illegal wireless
access. The idea is inspired by the non-isotropic jamming
model [10], which is used to ﬁght oﬀ radio interference. The
diﬀerence, however, is that we use the jamming model to
physically cordon oﬀ the given area from the covert external
access.
It is known that there is no wide-spread counter-
measure against jamming [5]. At the same time, the cost to
launch jamming attacks is relatively low. But by the same
argument, this very property allows us to develop a light-
weight and rugged method that strongly resists the illegit-
imate access from outside and cuts oﬀ information leakage
from a protected wireless network almost completely.
Below, we begin the discussion by presenting theoretical
jamming models for the secure wireless zone in Section 2.
In Section 3, we reveal how well the theoretical model is
matched with the real world measurements. We introduce
an algorithm for defensive jammer arrangement to carve the
wireless zone into a speciﬁed geometry in Section 4. Sec-
tion 5 overviews the related work. Finally, we conclude the
paper in Section 6.
2. THEORETICAL JAMMING MODEL
In this section, we ﬁrst specify the assumptions in our ap-
proach. Then we discuss the wireless communication range
under the eﬀect of jamming with the one-transceiver-one-
jammer model, and extend the model by adding more jam-
mers. Lastly, we address the issue related to the jamming
frequency selection in order to cope with the attackers’ spec-
tral evasion.
2.1 Assumptions
We want to protect the Wi-Fi networks which are vul-
nerable to the information leakage explained in Section 1.
All of the wireless nodes of the network are located inside a
physical perimeter. Assuming the wireless network is basi-
cally protected by standard security protocols such as IEEE
802.11i and IEEE 802.1x, we develop a non-cryptographic
physical-layer mechanism to complement the existing crypto-
based security. The mechanism must not depend on any pre-
shared secrecy and must not require any specialized hard-
ware or signiﬁcant modiﬁcations of existing standards.
Our approach exploits jamming to build a physical cordon
between the Wi-Fi coverage to be protected and the outside
area. We can control the parameters of jammers such as
positions and transmitting powers without restrictions. The
jammers are plugged into the power sources, and therefore
the energy is not a serious concern.
A malicious insider might use the alternative wireless com-
munication channel such as cellular networks to covertly
carry the information in the target network to the outside
colluder. These, however, are under control of network ad-
ministrator, and thus we assume that the cellular infrastruc-
ture can easily monitor and prevent this type of misbehavior.
There are some mechanisms to defeat jamming (e.g., in-
terference cancellation [4, 3], high-gain antenna, etc.), but
because these are very expensive to implement we can sig-
niﬁcantly increase the attacking cost and eﬃciently mitigate
the attack. The timing channel under jamming proposed in
[11] cannot deliver large data due to its low throughput (e.g.
slower than 10bps).
Lastly, the intentional jamming might be not permitted
due to the related regulations (e.g. FCC regulations in US).
But, this approach is still useful in places without these re-
strictions or where the permission is granted for special pur-
poses. Diﬀerent countries have diﬀerent regulations and the
detailed legal interpretation is out of topic in our paper.

Jamming Boundary and Shape Control
In order to decide the communication range of a wire-
less node, we can use the signal-to-interference-noise ratio
(SINR). For the transceiver A, the receiver S, and the jam-
mer J, S can hear A if the SINR γA/J (S) at S for the A’s
signal to the J’s noise is higher than the threshold β which is
decided by the used modulation technique. Hence, the jam-
ming boundary which decides the hearing range of S under
jamming is expressed as follows.

eﬃciency of omni-directional antenna and they operate on
the same frequency band. Note that the network adminis-
trator controls the jammer as well, so this conﬁguration is
reasonable to assume (though not necessary). Eq. (1) is thus
simpliﬁed as

where PA is the transmitting power of A, PJ is the trans-
mitting power of J, DJS is the distance between J and S,
DAS is the distance between A and S, and n is the path-loss
exponent, which varies with surrounding environments. It
is known that n = 2 for free space, n = 4 for ﬂat surface,
and n > 4 for indoor environments except tunnels [7].
Eq. (2) gives the idea that a jamming boundary is depen-
dent on the powers of A and J, and the distances from S to
them. The loss exponent n is determined by the surround-
ing area. We use both the free-space propagation model
(n=2) and the ﬂat-surface propagation model (n=4) to show
the relationship as n changes. Fig. 1 depicts the jamming
boundaries on the x-y plane when the transceiver A is lo-
cated at (0, 0), the jammer J is located at (j, 0), and the
SINR threshold β = 1. Table 1 shows the power relation-
ship between A and J for the boundaries shown in Fig. 1.
Although not shown for brevity, this relationship is main-
tained for other values of n as well.

where PAS is the amount of power received by S from A,
PJS is the amount of power received by S from J, and N0
is the ambient noise power.
Here, we ignore the ambient noise power N0 for the sim-
plicity of model derivation and apply the line-of-sight (LOS)
propagation model [7] to the received power at S. Note that
the LOS propagation model is only used as an example. De-
pending on the ﬁeld conﬁguration, any propagation model
can be used instead. We assume that A and J use the same
The precise circular curves depicted in Fig. 1 are only
approximations according to the LOS propagation model
used in Eq. (1) and Eq. (2). Therefore, the approximations
(and hence the model) can be intentionally conservative or
generous to provide an appropriate buﬀer to either side of
the line where reception may or may not occur.
Based on the one-transceiver-one-jammer, we now extend
the model to multiple jammers. Given the k number of
jammers, the SINR at S under jamming is given by

For the realistic model, we now consider an infrastructure
Wi-Fi network which consists of an AP and multiple stations
under the eﬀects of multiple jammers. Let us deﬁne the area
accessible to AP using the SINR function above as follows.
Definition 1. (Area Accessible To AP) If a station in
the area ZA(J1, J2,··· , Jk) can receive data from the AP A
under k jammers, ZA is deﬁned as an area accessible to AP.
Namely,
ZA(J1, J2,··· , Jk) =
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)γA/(J1,J2,··· ,Jk)(x, y) > β
(cid:110)
(cid:111)
,
(x, y)
where γ is the SINR function of (x, y) which is the location
of a station on the x-y plane, and β is a positive constant
which varies with modulation and coding.
Without loss of generality, we assume that β = 1 (0dB)
in the rest of this paper.
The area accessible to the AP A under eﬀects of k jammers
is a subset of the intersection of the areas accessible to the
AP A under the eﬀect of each single jammer. The proof of
this is detailed in [6]. We call the area ZA(J1, J2,··· , Jk)
the secure wireless zone, when the area accessible to AP is
walled from the outside.
Definition 2. (Secure Wireless Zone) Let O be an out-
side station which is not supposed to be a member of the
given wireless network, LO be the area in which O can be
located, and ZA is the area accessible to AP A. Then, ZA is
the secure wireless zone, only if
ZA(J1, J2,··· , Jk) ∩ LO = φ.
Jamming Frequency Selection
2.3
In the jamming model above, jammers only jam the sin-
gle channel on which the legitimate AP and the legitimate
stations communicate. In practice, however, multiple chan-
nels can be in use, and can cause problems to the model.
