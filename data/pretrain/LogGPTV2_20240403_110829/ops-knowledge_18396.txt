User: I created a module in Python which provides about a dozen functionalities. While it will be mostly used from within Python, there is a good fraction of legacy users which will be calling it from Perl.
What is the best way to make a plug in to this module? My thoughts are:

Provide the functionalities as command line utilities and make system calls
Create some sort of server and handle RPC calls (say, via JSON RPC)

Any advise?

Works really nicely.  This is the way programs like Python (and Perl) are meant to use used.
