User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows File Permissions and Attributes I'm somewhat confused about the whole Windows file security scheme. I come from a unix background, so I don't fully understand the relationship between file permissions/security settings and the attributes; specifically read-only, that a file can have.  

For example, if I log in as an administrator into my box and I have a file that allows full control for administrators, but has the read-only attribute set, that means I cannot write to that file? Is there any way besides removing the read-only attribute that I can write to files that I supposedly have full control over? If not, what's the advantage of having full control if you don't really have full control?

Assistant: File permissions dictate what access you have to a file - just like it sounds. Full control lets you create, delete, append, change permissions, change attributes, etc.

Files and folders can have additional attributes, much like files on most *nix filesystems. "Hidden" comes to mind as an example of this on both platforms. 

On Windows, some of the additional attributes include system, read-only, archive, encrypted, and compressed. When you have full control (or modify) you have the ability to change these attributes, but as you've discovered, a read-only file is read-only, even to someone with full control. While full control gives you the ability to change a file's attributes, it does not automatically override them, much like ls doesn't show the root user a hidden file by default on *nix.
