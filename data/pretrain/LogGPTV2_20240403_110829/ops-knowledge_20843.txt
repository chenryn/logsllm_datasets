Question: "An application uses the following regular expression to validate filenames before passing them to a command that lists the file details: /^[\w\-]+$/. Despite this validation, the application is still vulnerable to command injection. Why is the validation not effective in preventing this vulnerability?"
 "A": "The validation does not enforce the presence of a file extension, which is necessary to prevent command injection."
 "B": "The regular expression allows filenames to start with a '-', which could be interpreted as an option flag by the command-line interpreter."
 "C": "Using regular expressions for validation is inherently insecure and cannot prevent any form of injection."
 "D": "The validation allows whitespace characters, which can be used to separate commands and introduce malicious payloads."
Answer: B
