# A Review on Internet of Things (IoT): Security and Privacy Requirements and Solution Approaches

## Figure 2: Network Model Scenario for Body Area Network in the Context of Internet of Things (IoT)

### Abstract
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on the major security and privacy challenges arising from its exponential growth. It also discusses the types of security primitives and solution approaches being implemented to ensure secure communication and protect user data. Conventional security methods are often infeasible due to the heterogeneous nature of IoT devices, limited resources, and specific system architectures. To prevent unauthorized access, protect user privacy, and mitigate security threats, robust network security infrastructures are essential. Peer authentication and end-to-end data protection are critical to safeguard sensitive information and prevent malicious activities.

### Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has seen rapid growth, leading to significant security and privacy concerns. Traditional security mechanisms are not suitable for IoT environments due to the diverse nature of sensors, limited resources, and unique system architectures. This review paper aims to provide an overview of the security and privacy challenges in IoT and the solutions being proposed to address these issues.

### Cryptographic Considerations
Cryptographic computations are essential for ensuring secure communication in IoT. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is preferred in constrained environments because it offers the same level of security with significantly smaller key sizes compared to other cryptographic methods [3]. This makes ECC more efficient and suitable for resource-limited IoT devices.

### Conclusion
This paper provides a basic overview of the IoT, highlighting the major security and privacy challenges due to its exponential growth. It also discusses the types of security primitives and solution approaches being implemented to ensure secure communication and protect user data. Conventional security methods cannot be applied due to the heterogeneous nature of sensors, low resources, and the specific system architecture in IoT applications. To prevent unauthorized use of user data, protect privacy, and mitigate security and privacy threats, robust network security infrastructures are required. Peer authentication and end-to-end data protection are crucial to prevent eavesdropping and malicious activities. Any unauthorized use of data can restrict users from utilizing IoT-based applications. This review paper also identifies the security solution approaches that have been recently proposed, along with the related challenges and attack techniques used to compromise sensor nodes in IoT.
