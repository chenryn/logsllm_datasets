IV. Conclusion
to 
This paper aims to provides the reader a basic 
overview about Internet of Things, the major security and 
privacy  challenges  because  of  its  exponential  growth 
and  what  kind  of  security  primitives  and  solution 
approaches  are  being  taken  to  make  communication 
secure  and  to  protect  the  user’s  data.  Conventional 
security  primitives  cannot  be  applied  due 
the 
heterogeneous nature of sensors, low resources and the 
system  architecture  in  IoT  applications.  To  prevent 
unauthorized  use  of  user’s  data,  protect  their  privacy 
and  to  mitigate  security  and  privacy  threats,  strong 
network  security 
infrastructures  are  required.  Peer 
authentication  and  End-to-End  data  protection  are 
crucial  requirements 
to  prevent  eavesdropping  on 
sensitive  data  or  malicious 
triggering  of  harmful 
actuating  tasks.  Any  unauthorized  use  of  data  may 
restrict  users  to  utilize  IoT  based  applications.  This 
review paper provides the security solution approaches 
been proposed recently identifying both the challenges 
related to security and privacy and the attack techniques 
used to compromise/fail the sensor nodes in Internet of 
Things as well. Current approaches are focused on pre-
deployed,  pre-shared  keys  on  both  ends  whereas 
certificate-based  authentication  is  generally  considered 
infeasible 
resource  sensors.  New 
security  paradigm  are  needed  for  End-to-End  secure 
key  establishment  protocols  that  are  lightweight  for
