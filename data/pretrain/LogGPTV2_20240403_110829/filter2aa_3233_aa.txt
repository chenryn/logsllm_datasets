Reports on Computer Systems Technology 
The Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) promotes the U.S. economy and public welfare by providing technical 
leadership for the Nation’s measurement and standards infrastructure. ITL develops tests, test 
methods, reference data, proof of concept implementations, and technical analyses to advance the 
development and productive use of information technology. ITL’s responsibilities include the 
development of management, administrative, technical, and physical standards and guidelines for 
the cost-effective security and privacy of other than national security-related information in federal 
information systems. The Special Publication 800-series reports on ITL’s research, guidelines, and 
outreach efforts in information system security, and its collaborative activities with industry, 
government, and academic organizations. 
Abstract 
Zero trust (ZT) is the term for an evolving set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses 
from static, network-based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. A zero trust 
architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and 
workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based 
solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based 
on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both 
subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is 
established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring 
your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-
owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, 
workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer 
seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an 
abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use 
cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security 
posture.

Acknowledgments 
This document is the product of a collaboration between multiple federal agencies and is 
overseen by the Federal CIO Council. The architecture subgroup is responsible for development 
of this document, but there are specific individuals who deserve recognition. These include Greg 
Holden, project manager of the Federal CIO Council ZTA project; Alper Kerman, project 
manager for the NIST/National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence ZTA effort; and Douglas 
Montgomery.  
Audience 
This document is intended to describe zero trust for enterprise security architects. It is meant to 
aid understanding of zero trust for civilian unclassified systems and provide a road map to 
migrate and deploy zero trust security concepts to an enterprise environment. Agency 
cybersecurity managers, network administrators, and managers may also gain insight into zero 
trust and ZTA from this document. It is not intended to be a single deployment plan for ZTA as 
an enterprise will have unique business use cases and data assets that require safeguards. Starting 
with a solid understanding of the organization’s business and data will result in a strong 
approach to zero trust.

Introduction 
A typical enterprise’s infrastructure has grown increasingly complex. A single enterprise may 
operate several internal networks, remote offices with their own local infrastructure, remote 
and/or mobile individuals, and cloud services. This complexity has outstripped legacy methods 
of perimeter-based network security as there is no single, easily identified perimeter for the 
enterprise. Perimeter-based network security has also been shown to be insufficient since once 
attackers breach the perimeter, further lateral movement is unhindered. 
This complex enterprise has led to the development of a new model for cybersecurity known as 
“zero trust” (ZT). A ZT approach is primarily focused on data and service protection but can and 
should be expanded to include all enterprise assets (devices, infrastructure components, 
applications, virtual and cloud components) and subjects (end users, applications and other non-
human entities that request information from resources). Throughout this document, “subject” 
will be used unless the section relates directly to a human end user in which “user” will be 
specifically used instead of the more generic “subject.” Zero trust security models assume that an 
attacker is present in the environment and that an enterprise-owned environment is no 
different—or no more trustworthy—than any nonenterprise-owned environment. In this new 
paradigm, an enterprise must assume no implicit trust and continually analyze and evaluate the 
risks to its assets and business functions and then enact protections to mitigate these risks. In 
zero trust, these protections usually involve minimizing access to resources (such as data and
