5 Abstract Analysis
Much of the analysis of one system using dynamic platforms as a defense applies to any
such system. First, we explain the effects that contribute to our experiment results and
then we generalize our analysis to any dynamic platform technique.
5.1 Limited Duration Effect
The ﬁrst effect contributing to the results is the limited duration effect. Let d be the
duration of the transaction on a platform, T be the period that the attacker must be
present, and s the start time of attack. If T > d, the attacker can never win. For T < d,
the attacker can only win if she starts early enough during the d− T interval. As a result,
the probability of winning for the attacker is a decreasing linear function of T .

This explains the general decreasing trend for the probability of success as a function
of attacker’s goal in Fig. 2.

Counter-intuitively, this effect also explains the straight-line result for the 1-platform
experiment in Fig. 2. Although in the 1-platform case, the platform never changes, the
probability of success decreases linearly with time because the entire trial has a limited
duration. The attacker cannot possibly win if she starts late even if that single platform
is vulnerable. This explains the similarity of the 1-platform result in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4.
5.2 Diversity Effect
Informally speaking, the intuition behind the concept of diversity is that it is harder for
an attacker to compromise different platforms than it is to compromise homogeneous
ones. Since we assume that the platforms are all available and no separation exists
between them, in the case of homogeneous platforms, they can all be compromised by
an exploit that works against one of them. On the other hand, if the platforms are diverse
(which is the case in our experiments), an exploit can work against some of them, but
not the other ones.
In practice, diversity creates an effect which occurs when the required attacker goal
T passes between various multiples of the duration of each platform d. For example, if
the attacker goal passes from being a bit less than a single platform duration to a bit
more, then instead of a single vulnerable platform, two need to be used consecutively.
The same effect happens as we transition from two to three and so on. The result is
downward steps in the curve when the required attacker goal passes multiples of the
platform duration. Fig. 5 illustrates this impact when three out of ﬁve platforms are vul-
nerable. The ﬁrst platform is trivially vulnerable with 3
5 probability. Since we do not
have immediate repeats, the subsequent platforms are chosen from the four remaining
ones of which two are vulnerable, so the probability that the second platform is vulnera-
ble if the ﬁrst one is vulnerable is 2
4 . As a result, both the ﬁrst and the second platforms
5 × 2
are vulnerable with probability 3
4 . If we extend the analysis, the ﬁrst, second, and
third platforms are vulnerable with probability 3
4 )2 , and so on (see Fig. 5).

5.3 Multi-instance Effect
In the multi-instance case, the system is compromised if the majority of platforms are
compromised. Although Talent does not natively support multi-instance, we augment it
with a simple voting mechanism to analyze the impact of running multiple platforms si-
multaneously. With the same experiment setup as described in section 4 we analyze the
probability of success when the application runs on multiple platforms and the majority
of the platforms are compromised.
When the system is multi-instance, if there is no platform change, the case becomes
trivial; that is, if the majority of the platforms are not vulnerable, the system as a whole
is never compromised and the attacker never wins. On the other hand, if the majority of
the platforms are vulnerable, the attacker wins as soon as the exploits are launched and
remains in control indeﬁnitely. As a result, we only show the effect when the platform
change happens. Moreover, the 1-platform and 5-platform cases are also trivial, so we
only show the results for a 3-platform setup. In this setup, the application runs on three
platforms simultaneously. For each platform, the application migrates to a new platform
uniformly randomly after spending 40-60 seconds. Thus, the migrations may be out-of-
sync, but at each instance of time the application is running on three diverse platforms.
The multi-instance effect is shown in Fig. 6. The single instance result is the same as
the 3-platform setup in Fig. 2.
x!
Counter-intuitively, the multi-instance setup is less secure for small values of T . This
arises from a combinatorial effect. Since three of the ﬁve platforms are vulnerable, there
are three conﬁgurations in which the majority is not vulnerable (the two invulnerable
platforms selected with one other vulnerable platform) which is expressed by C (3, 1)
where C (x, y) =
y!(x−y)! is the combinatorial choice function. The total number of
choices is C (5, 3) = 10. As a result, the defender wins with the probability of 30% and
thus, the attacker wins with the probability of 70%. This is why the multi-instance case
starts from 0.7. With the single instance case this probability is smaller because there
is a higher probability of a combination with an invulnerable platform. In other words,
when the majority of the platforms are vulnerable (3 out of 5 in this case), there is a
higher probability that if we choose three platforms, two or more of them are vulnerable
(1 − C (3, 1)) than if we choose just one platform and that is vulnerable ( 3
5 ). We will
explain this effect in more details in Section 6.1.
5.4 Cleanup Effect
A dynamic platform system supports cleanup if every inactive platform in restored into
its pristine state. Talent does not natively support cleanup either, but we augment it
with a cleanup capability to evaluate its impact. As discussed earlier, techniques such
as SCIT [9] and MAS [18] implement cleanup.
The impact of cleanup is trivial if the exploit is only launched once and never re-
peated; the attacker may compromise the active platform for the remainder of the time
on that platform, but when the platform changes, the system becomes pristine and the at-
tacker never wins again. This is because the inactive platforms are being cleaned while
the attacker attacks the active one. Consequently, in the case of a non-repeating exploit,
the portion of time the attacker is in control amortizes with the duration of the trial.
