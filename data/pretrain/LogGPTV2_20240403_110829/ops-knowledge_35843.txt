User: How to deal with common security threats to web applications, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks?
Assistant: Here are some suggestions for dealing with common security threats to web applications: 1. SQL injection attacks: - Use parameterized queries or stored procedures instead of directly concatenating SQL statements. - Filter the data entered by the user and limit the format of the input value. - Use ORM framework and other tools to access the database to prevent handwritten SQL statements. - Restrict access to the database to only those users who need it. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): - Filter and escape the data entered by users to prevent malicious scripts from being inserted. - Set CSP (Content Security Policy) to limit the source of resources and prevent untrusted resources from being embedded in the page. - Use the HTTPOnly and Secure attributes to restrict the transmission and manipulation of cookies. - Carry out targeted defense against vulnerable places such as input boxes, rich text boxes, and comments, such as filtering and verifying URL links entered by users. In addition, you can also use security tools such as web firewalls and security scanners for security detection and defense, regularly update programs and framework versions, and strengthen identity authentication and access control measures to strengthen the security of web applications.
