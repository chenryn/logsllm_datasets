Hi,  
Hope everyone is ok
## Describe the bug
In Chrome V68, everything is ok but the problem is with the Chrome used by
Google Bot.  
In fact, in my home page, after building the home page, the title is
automatically replaced by ": An unexpected error has occured".  
You definetely need to go over "to reproduce and dem section"
## To Reproduce & Dem
You need to go to
https://www.browserling.com/browse/win/7/chrome/41/https://en.vetolib.vet and
observe the title.  
The other page are totally OK.
## System information
  * NextJs 6.1.1
  * Node.JS 8.11.1
  * Nginx AWS Server
## My Code
document.js :
         `
          {/*Meta tag for every page*/}
          {/*  */}
          {/* Use minimum-scale=1 to enable GPU rasterization */}
          {/* PWA primary color */}
          {/* Links*/}
          {/* Comfortaa Logo Font */}  
          {/* GOOGLE SEARCH CONSOLE */}
      `
landing.js (actually it's the home page)
    import LandingMeta from 'landing/landingMeta';
      return (
      );
And the famous LandingMeta.js
        return (
            {/*Meta tag That  can change on some pages (use a key to avoid duplication)*/}
            Vetolib : Make An online appointment
              {/*A brief description of the page.*/}
              {/*A series of keywords you deem relevant to the page in question.*/}
              {/*An indication to search engine crawlers (robots or "bots") as to what they should do with the page.*/}
    );
Thank you so much for your help
