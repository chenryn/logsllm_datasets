#### A. Main Survey

**Purpose of Study and Task Description:**
We are conducting an academic survey to evaluate the use of Double Patterns in mobile authentication. Participants will be asked to generate a number of patterns under different conditions. The study focuses on the effectiveness of using multiple patterns for mobile authentication on Android devices. Androids typically use pattern locks instead of traditional security parameters like numeric PINs or alphanumeric passcodes. Our research aims to implement an additional pattern lock as an enhanced security measure and to assess its effectiveness. You will be asked to complete a short survey that requires you to generate a set of Android patterns under a security scenario, such as locking your device. Your choices and responses to security and usability questions will be used in the final evaluation. The expected completion time is 8-10 minutes, with a maximum of 1 hour. You will be compensated $1.00 for your participation.

**Device Usage Questions:**
When referring to "mobile devices" throughout this survey, consider these to include smartphones and tablet computers. Traditional laptop computers, two-in-one computers (like the Microsoft Surface), or e-readers (like the Amazon Kindle) are not considered mobile devices for the purposes of this survey.

**What are Android Pattern Locks?**
Pattern Locks are used to unlock your smartphone, similar to a PIN. Patterns require you to "draw" a shape that connects at least four of the contact points without lifting your finger or repeating a contact point. Below is the Pattern Lock interface on a Samsung Android mobile device.

**What are Double Pattern Locks?**
Double Pattern Locks are similar to Pattern Locks but require you to "draw" two shapes on the same 3x3 grid of contact points. The combination of the two patterns entered in the same order is used to unlock your smartphone. Each pattern in a Double Pattern is drawn the same way as before, but once you finish drawing your first pattern by lifting your finger, you then draw a second pattern. When drawing your second pattern, the first pattern will be displayed, and you may reuse contact points from your first pattern in drawing your second. However, you may not use your first pattern as your second pattern.

In this survey, we are exploring the possibility of using Double Pattern Locks as a new way to secure mobile devices. On the next page, you will have a chance to practice entering a Double Pattern before proceeding with the rest of the survey, where we will ask you to select your own Double Pattern that you would use to unlock your personal smartphone.

**Practice:**
Practice entering a Double Pattern. (See Figure 1 for visual.)

**Instructions:**
For this survey, you will be asked to create a Double Pattern you would likely use for a personal device unlock, such as on your smartphone. You will need to recall this Double Pattern later in the survey, so choose something that is secure and memorable as you may use on your personal device. We ask that you DO NOT write down your patterns or use other aids to help you remember.

- I understand that I should not write down my patterns or use other aids to assist in the survey. [ ] I understand
- I understand that I will be asked to create a Double Pattern for a personal device unlock. [ ] I understand

**Selection:**
Create a Double Pattern for a Personal Device Unlock. (See Figure 1 for visual.)

**Post Entry Questions:**
Thinking about the Double Pattern Lock you just chose:

5. I feel that the Double Pattern I created provides adequate security for unlocking my personal device.
