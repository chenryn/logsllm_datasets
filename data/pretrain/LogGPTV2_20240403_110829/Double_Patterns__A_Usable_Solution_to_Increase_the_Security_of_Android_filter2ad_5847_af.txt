A MAIN SURVEY
Purpose of Study and Task Description: We are conducting an aca-
demic survey about the use of Double Patterns in mobile authenti-
cation, and you will be asked to complete a survey that will ask you
to generate a number of patterns under different conditions. You
are being asked to participate in a research study focused on the
effectiveness of using multiple patterns for mobile authentication
on an Android device. Androids implement pattern locks rather
than traditional security parameters, for example, numeric PINs or
Alphanumeric Passcodes. Our research will focus on implementing
an additional pattern lock as an increased security measure, and
we are investigating the effectiveness of such a method. You will be
asked to complete a short survey that requires you to generate a set
of Android patterns under a security scenario, such as locking your
device. Your eventual choices will be used in the final evaluation,
as well as your responses to a set of security and usability ques-
tions. The expected completion time of the survey is 8-10 minutes,
and no more than 1 hour. You will be compensated $1.00 for your
participation.

Device Usage Questions
When referring to "mobile devices" throughout this survey, consider
these to include smartphones and tablet computers. Traditional
laptop computers, two-in-one computers, like the Microsoft Surface,
or e-readers, like the Amazon Kindle, are not considered mobile
devices for the purposes of this survey.
(1) How many mobile devices do you use regularly?
◦ 0 ◦ 1 ◦ 2 ◦ 3 ◦ 4+
(2) What brands of smartphone do you use for personal use?
(Select all that apply)
◦ Apple ◦ Samsung ◦ LG ◦ Motorola ◦ Google/Pixel/Nexus
◦ Huawei ◦ ZTE ◦ Other
(3) What biometric method do you use most often to unlock
your primary personal smartphone?
◦ Fingerprint ◦ Face ◦ Iris ◦ Other Biometric ◦ I do
not use a biometric ◦ I do not use a smartphone ◦ Prefer
Not to Say
(4) If choose biometric: You have indicated that you use a bio-
metric on your smartphone. Please answer the following
question related to your response. How do you unlock your
primary personal smartphone when you reboot the device
or if your biometric fails?
◦ Pattern Unlock ◦ 4-Digit PIN ◦ 6-Digit PIN ◦ PIN of
other length ◦ Alphanumeric Password ◦ I use an unlock
method not listed ◦ I do not use a smartphone ◦ Prefer
Not to Say
If did not choose biometric: You have indicated that you do
not use a biometric on your smartphone. Please answer the
following question related to your response. What unlock
method do you use on your primary personal smartphone?
◦ Pattern Unlock ◦ 4-Digit PIN ◦ 6-Digit PIN ◦ PIN of
other length ◦ Alphanumeric Password ◦ I use an unlock
method not listed ◦ I do not use a smartphone ◦ Prefer
Not to Say
What are Android Pattern Locks? Pattern Locks are used to unlock
your smartphone, like a PIN. Patterns require you to "draw" shape
that connects at least four of the contact points without lifting your
finger or repeating a contact point. Displayed below is the Pattern
Lock interface on a Samsung Android mobile device.
What are Double Pattern Locks? Double Pattern Locks are the same
as Pattern Locks but require you to "draw" two shapes on the same
3x3 grid of contact points. The combination of the two patterns
entered in the same order is now used to unlock your smartphone.
Each pattern in a Double Pattern is drawn the same way as
before, but once you finish drawing your first pattern by lifting
your finger, you then draw a second pattern. When drawing your
second pattern, the first pattern will be displayed, and you may
reuse contact points from your first pattern in drawing your second.
However, you may not use your first pattern as your second pattern.
In this survey, we are exploring the possibility of using Double
Pattern Locks as a new way to secure mobile devices. On the next
page, you will have a chance to practice entering a Double Pattern
before proceeding with the rest of this survey, where we will ask
you to select your own Double Pattern that you would use to unlock
your personal smartphone.
Practice: Practice entering a Double Pattern. (see Figure 1 for visual.)
Instructions: For this survey, you will be asked to create a Dou-
ble Pattern you would likely use for a personal device unlock, such
as you would use on your smartphone.
You will need to recall this Double Pattern later in the survey, so
choose something that is secure and memorable as you may use on
your personal device.
We ask that you DO NOT write down your patterns or use other
aids to help you remember.
I understand that I should not write down my patterns or use other
aids to assist in the survey. ◦ I understand
I understand that I will be asked to create a Double Pattern for a
personal device unlock. ◦ I understand
