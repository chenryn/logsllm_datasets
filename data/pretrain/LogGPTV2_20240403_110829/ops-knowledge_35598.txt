User: I am trying to open Notepad using popen and write something into it. I can't get my head around it. I can open Notepad using command: 
notepadprocess=subprocess.Popen('notepad.exe')
I am trying to identify how can I write anything in the text file using python. Any help is appreciated.
Assistant: Found the exact solution from Alex K's comment. I used pywinauto to perform this task.
