### Number of Occurrences per Command

When the number of occurrences per command does not match, we neither reward nor penalize this discrepancy. This is because such a mismatch does not definitively indicate whether the command was entered by a legitimate user or a masquerader.

After implementing this mismatch scoring scheme, our results significantly improved over the previous semi-global algorithm, where mismatches were neither rewarded nor penalized. Our selective reward and penalty system for mismatched command alignments, based on command frequency, allows us to differentiate between a user and a masquerader. This approach takes into account concept drift in our tested block sequences and allows for small variations in user activity based on their past behavior.

### 5.4 Overall Results

After tuning the algorithm as described above, we have achieved a hit rate and false positive rate that are highly competitive with other top masquerade detection algorithms. The only algorithms that perform comparably with our current results are the Naïve Bayes algorithms. All other algorithms perform somewhat worse than our best results, although they may fall near our Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve. However, their detection abilities are clearly below our 75.8% hit rate [13].

### 6. Discussion & Future Work

Bioinformatics, as an area of study, is uniquely suited to create algorithms that can be applied in various fields. The sequence alignment algorithms, as discussed here, are specialized pattern-matching algorithms that, with some tuning, can be applied to many different fields, including intrusion detection. Our particular system is also applicable to graphic user interface (GUI) interactions, as these interactions can be broken down into various system calls, which can then be analyzed by this algorithm to detect intrusions from GUI interactions.

Wepsi et al. have also noticed this unique use of bioinformatics algorithms in their application of the Teiresias pattern-matching algorithm to flag abnormal Unix system calls that might indicate an attack on a Unix process [18]. While both our alignment algorithm and the Teiresias algorithm originated in bioinformatics, their approaches to detection vary considerably. We use sequence alignment to score similarity between command sequences, whereas Wespi et al. use dominant patterns to classify abnormality in Unix processes.

We have presented a novel implementation of a modified sequence alignment algorithm for the detection of masqueraders, and shown that, with appropriate customization and tuning, it performs competitively when compared to the top masquerade detection algorithms. Although significant customization has been done to the generic Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to produce a good masquerade detection algorithm, there are still several additional metrics that could be used to improve the algorithm's performance.

One great advantage of using alignments to characterize similarity between command sequences is that the alignment can produce many different statistics. These include the density of the alignment (alignment score divided by alignment length), the maximum, minimum, and average gap length, the total number of matching and mismatched commands, and the total number of gaps in each of the aligned subsequences. These statistics measure different aspects of similarity and can be used to further distinguish user subsequences from intruder subsequences.

Although the initial false positive rate of this algorithm is somewhat lackluster, it is important to consider that this is a new method of intrusion detection, and initial testing was needed to determine its viability. While the alignment score is effective in identifying intruders, it often misidentifies user subsequences as intruders. This may be due to uncharacteristic user behavior, which can be identified and ignored. Fortunately, there may be subtle differences between uncharacteristic user behavior and intruder behavior that can be detected by looking at the alignment statistics in a multidimensional space. A multidimensional approach using several different alignment statistics could be a more powerful and robust mechanism for decreasing the false positive rate of our algorithm. Additionally, the parameters of the scoring algorithm itself (gap penalties, mismatch scoring, and match scoring) can be tuned even further to allow for a more dynamic scoring system, similar to what has already been done with the mismatch scoring, to better separate legitimate user activity from malicious activity.

Furthermore, this method is significantly different from other intrusion detection technologies and is, therefore, particularly well-suited to coupling with existing intrusion detection technologies in a hybrid system that could provide even more impressive results.
