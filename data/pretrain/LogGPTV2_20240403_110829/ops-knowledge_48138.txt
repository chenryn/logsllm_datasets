Question: Consider a scenario where an Android device manufacturer is planning to implement a new SELinux policy for their vendor partition. Which of the following strategies would be the most appropriate for avoiding labeling collisions between the platform and vendor policies while adhering to best practices?
"A": "All vendor declarations should have a unique prefix such as 'np_', but file labeling within the vendor partition should not adhere to any specific guidelines.",
"B": "Vendor services in init rc files should have 'vendor.' as a prefix, and all file labeling within the vendor partition should default to 'vendor_file'.",
"C": "Platform policy should provide labels for '/system' components, and vendor policy should avoid labeling these components to ensure framework-only OTA updates.",
"D": "Vendor policy may label files in '/dev' without any restrictions, including those files not within the '/dev/vendor' subdirectory."
