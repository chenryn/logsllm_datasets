Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

I'm relatively new to this, so I apologize if my explanation is not entirely clear. I am using Python scripts on a server at work to pull data from our Oracle database. However, whenever I execute the script, I encounter the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "update_52w_forecast_from_oracle.py", line 3, in <module>
    import cx_Oracle
ImportError: libnnz11.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

If I run the following command before executing the script, it runs without issues, but only for that session:

```sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
```

After logging out and back in, I have to reset the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` again. Is there a way to make this change permanent? Additionally, I am trying to use Cron to automate the script to run early Monday morning, but it did not execute as expected.

**Update:** I resolved the issue by adding the path to my `.bashrc` file in the home directory.

This version is clearer, more structured, and provides all the necessary information in a professional manner.
