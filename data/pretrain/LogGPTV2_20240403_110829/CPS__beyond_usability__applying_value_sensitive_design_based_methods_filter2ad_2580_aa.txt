### Abstract
Wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs) are cyber-physical systems that deliver life-saving treatments to cardiac patients with dangerous heart conditions. Current access control models for these systems are insufficient, necessitating enhanced security measures. The technical security community has explored new directions to improve security on resource-constrained IMDs. However, defenses must not only be technically secure; they must also align with the needs and constraints of their application spaces. Designing for such specialized applications requires a deep understanding of stakeholders, their values, and the contexts of technology usage.

Using value sensitive design (VSD) as a framework, we conducted three workshops with medical providers to gather their perspectives and values. Our workshop structure is based on established methods in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, and the number of participants (N=24) is consistent with current practices for inductive, exploratory studies. We present findings on:
1. What participants find important in providing care and performing their jobs.
2. Their reactions to potential security system concepts.
3. Their views on the properties that security systems should have or avoid, considering the side effects within their work context.

We synthesize these results to articulate design considerations for future technical security systems and suggest directions for further research. This study contributes to the security research for an important class of cyber-physical systems (IMDs) and provides an example of leveraging techniques from other communities to better explore the landscape of security designs for technologies.

### 1. Introduction
This work focuses on the security of an important class of cyber-physical systems: wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs). We bring together the technical computer security research community and value sensitive design (VSD)—a framework developed within the human-computer interaction (HCI) community—to gather domain-specific information necessary for designing and deploying effective security.

#### 1.1 On the Need for Value-Sensitive Investigations
Designing effective security systems that are appreciated and embraced by users and other stakeholders requires a deep understanding of stakeholders, their values, and the contexts of technology use. This is particularly true for critical systems like cyber-physical systems, which may require non-standard security and access control solutions. To design effective, deployable security, it is crucial to foreground human beings and human-centered methods in the research process.

Previous research has explored users' internal mental models to help security researchers design systems that align with user expectations and understand unexpected user behaviors. Other work examines the design and evaluation of usable security and access control systems. While valuable, these studies often focus solely on users and neglect other important stakeholders and the broader ecosystem in which the technology and its security system will be deployed.

Drawing on VSD, we identify four additional elements essential for the computer security research and design process:
- **Stakeholders**: Who are the people directly or indirectly affected by the system?
- **Stakeholder Goals and Values**: What are the diverse stakeholder groups trying to accomplish, and what do they value?
- **Implications for Values**: How might different security design choices impact stakeholder values, positively or negatively? How might direct and indirect stakeholder groups be differently impacted?
- **Communicating Technical Concepts in Comprehensible Ways**: How can security researchers and designers communicate technical security concepts in ways that stakeholders can understand and appreciate?

#### 1.2 Implantable Medical Devices
Many modern wireless implantable medical devices, including pacemakers and defibrillators, are both computational and wireless. These cyber-physical systems contain private information and can physically affect patients' bodies, making them a critical class of devices to secure.

#### 1.3 Our Work
In this study, we apply VSD to the domain of implantable cardiac devices, which has already received significant interest from the community. We conducted security-oriented Envisioning Workshops with various stakeholders involved in the care of patients with implantable cardiac devices, including nurses, emergency physicians, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and device manufacturer representatives. We present results on:
1. What participants find important in providing care and performing their jobs.
2. The metaphors participants use to describe implantable cardiac devices and security systems.
3. Participants' evaluations of potential systems representing different directions in technical security design.
4. Participants' views on the properties that security systems should have or avoid due to domain-relevant side effects.

The purpose of this research is not to gather feedback on the security performance of these systems but to understand how different access control systems might impact participants' jobs and their ability to care for patients. This information helps security researchers design solutions that avoid negative side effects and tailor solutions to the needs of the domain.

### 2. Related Work

#### 2.1 Technical Work in IMD Security
Implantable cardiac devices store information such as the patient's name and records of irregular heart rhythms. Patients visit cardiology clinics periodically so that medical staff can download information and adjust device settings. Current-generation cardiac devices can communicate wirelessly with external equipment from distances up to 5 meters away. Wireless capabilities offer several benefits, such as allowing doctors to configure devices from a distance and enabling remote monitoring without interrupting the patient's activities. However, wireless interfaces also increase the communication surface that can be attacked, and current security models do not provide per-device access control.

In 2008, it was demonstrated that an implantable cardiac device with centimeters-range wireless communications could be compromised by an unauthorized party [18]. In 2011, it was shown that a device with meters-range wireless capabilities could also be compromised [15]. Other work has highlighted vulnerabilities in wireless insulin pump systems [23][28].

Challenges for securing wireless IMDs include balancing security (blocking inappropriate access) while ensuring safety in emergencies (facilitating appropriate situational access). For example, a system that grants wireless access only to individuals who know a password, such as the patient's regular cardiologist, improves security but negatively impacts safety if emergency personnel cannot access the device.

Several early-stage proposals aim to improve security while prioritizing medical access. One direction involves a wristband that protects the IMD when worn but can be removed for emergency access [8][15][1]. Another direction involves body modifications, such as RFID implants or tattoos with visible or UV-visible ink [32]. Another approach uses cryptographic distance-bounding, intra-body signaling, or physiologically-derived keys to activate longer-range wireless capabilities [3][30][37].

### 3. Methodology
Our methodology involved conducting Envisioning Workshops with stakeholders to gather their perspectives and values. The workshop structure was based on established HCI methods, and the number of participants (N=24) was consistent with current practices for inductive, exploratory studies. The workshops focused on:
- Identifying what participants find important in their roles.
- Evaluating potential security system concepts.
- Discussing the properties that security systems should have or avoid.

### 4. Results and Discussion
The results of our workshops provided valuable insights into the needs and concerns of various stakeholders. Key findings include:
- The importance of maintaining patient safety and care quality.
- Reactions to potential security system concepts, including positive and negative feedback.
- Views on the properties that security systems should have, such as ease of use and minimal disruption to care processes.

These findings help inform the design of future security systems, ensuring they are both secure and practical for use in the healthcare setting.

### 5. Conclusion
This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating value-sensitive design principles in the development of security systems for implantable cardiac devices. By gathering and synthesizing stakeholder perspectives, we provide a foundation for designing more effective and user-friendly security solutions. Future research should continue to explore the intersection of technical security and human-centered design in other domains.
