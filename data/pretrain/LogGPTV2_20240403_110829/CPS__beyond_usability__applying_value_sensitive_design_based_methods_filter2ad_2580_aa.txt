ABSTRACT 
Wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs) are cyber-physical 
systems that deliver life-saving treatments to cardiac patients with 
dangerous  heart  conditions.  Current  access  control  models  for 
these  systems  are  insufficient;  more  security  is  necessary.  In 
response  to  this  problem,  the  technical  security  community  has 
investigated  new  directions  for  improving  security  on  these 
resource-constrained  devices.  Defenses,  however,  must  not  only 
be technically secure; in order to be deployable, defenses must be 
designed to work within the needs and constraints of their relevant 
application  spaces.  Designing 
for  an  application  space—
particularly  a  specialized  one—requires  a  deep  understanding  of 
the  stakeholders,  their  values,  and  the  contexts  of  technology 
usage. Grounding our work in value sensitive design (VSD), we 
collaborated  as  an  interdisciplinary  team  to  conduct  three 
workshops  with  medical  providers  for  the  purpose  of  gathering 
their  values  and  perspectives.  The  structure  of  our  workshop 
builds on known workshop structures within the human-computer 
interaction  (HCI)  community,  and  the  number  of  participants  in 
our  workshops  (N=24)  is  compatible  with  current  practices  for 
inductive,  exploratory  studies.  We  present  results  on:  what  the 
participants  find  important  with  respect  to  providing  care  and 
performing their jobs; their reactions to potential security system 
concepts;  and  their  views  on  what  security  system  properties 
should be sought or avoided due to side effects within the context 
of their work practice. We synthesize these results, use the results 
to  articulate  design  considerations  for  future  technical  security 
systems, and suggest directions for further research. Our research 
not  only  provides  a  contribution  to  security  research  for  an 
important class of cyber-physical systems (IMDs); it also provides 
an  example  of  leveraging  techniques  from  other  communities  to

1.  INTRODUCTION 
This  work  focuses  on  security  for  an  important  class  of  cyber-
physical  systems:  wireless  implantable  medical  devices.  In  this 
work, we bring together the technical computer security research 
community  and  value  sensitive  design—a  framework  first 
developed within the human-computer interaction community—in 
order  to  gather  the  kind  of  domain-specific  information  that  is 
necessary to design and deploy effective security. 
On  the  Need  for  Value-Sensitive  Investigations.  Designing 
effective security systems that will be appreciated and embraced 
by users and other stakeholders requires a deep understanding of 
stakeholders,  their  values,  and  the  contexts  of  technology  use.  
This  is  especially  true  for  systems  like  cyber-physical  systems, 
which  perform  critical  functions  and  can  require  non-standard 
security  and  access  control  solutions.  In  order  for  the  security 
community to design effective security that can be deployed in the 
real  world,  it  is  critical  that  human  beings  and  human-centered 
methods (e.g., [10], [27]) be foregrounded in the research process. 
Prior research has explored users’ internal mental models in order 
to help security researchers design systems that act in accordance 
with  users’  expectations;  this  kind  of  work  also  helps  security 
researchers  understand  the  reasons  behind  unexpected  user 
behaviors (e.g., [13][38]). Other work examines how to design for 
and  evaluate  the  performance  of  usable  security  and  access 
control  systems  (e.g.,  [2][4][5][19][33]).  While  this  body  of 
research is valuable, the studies are often focused solely on users, 
and often give little consideration to other important stakeholders 
or  the  larger  ecosystem  in  which  a  technology  and  its  security 
system are likely to be deployed. 
As part of our research agenda—and drawing on value sensitive 
design—we  have  identified  four  additional  elements  that  we 
believe are essential to consider in the computer security research 
and design process: 
• 
• 
• 
Stakeholders (e.g., [6], [14], [24], ). Who are the broad set 
of people who have a direct or indirect stake in the system? 
Indirect  stakeholders  are  not  users,  but  may  nonetheless  be 
impacted significantly by the technology. 
Stakeholder  Goals  and  Values  (e.g.,  [6],  [7],  [14],  [24], 
[41]).  What  are  the  diverse  stakeholder  groups  trying  to 
accomplish, and what do they value?  
Implications  for  Values  (e.g.,  [6],  [12],  [14],  [24],  [25]). 
How  might  different  security  design  choices  potentially 
impact stakeholder values—positively or negatively? In what 
ways  might  direct  and  indirect  stakeholder  groups  be 
differently impacted? 
•  Communicating  Technical  Concepts  in  Comprehensible 
Ways (e.g., [6], [7], [26]). How can security researchers and 
designers  communicate  about  technical  security  concepts 
with  stakeholders  in  ways  that  stakeholders  can  understand 
and appreciate?

from 
the  community 
Implantable  Medical  Devices.  Many  modern 
Wireless 
implantable  medical  devices, 
including  pacemakers  and 
defibrillators, are both computational and wireless. These cyber-
physical  systems  both  contain  private  information  and  can 
physically  affect  patients’  bodies.  The  combination  of  these 
properties makes IMDs a critical class of devices to secure. 
Our  Work.  In  this  study  we  draw  upon  value  sensitive  design 
(see  Section  2.2)  to  further  these  agenda  elements  using  the 
domain of implantable cardiac devices—a domain that has already 
received 
(e.g., 
[15][37][30][18]). 
We  conducted  security-oriented  Envisioning  Workshops  (see 
Section 4.2) with a variety of stakeholders involved in the care of 
patients  with  implantable  cardiac  devices,  including:  nurses, 
emergency physicians, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and device 
manufacturer  representatives.  We  present  results  on:  (1)  what 
participants  find  important  with  respect  to  providing  care  and 
performing  their  jobs;  (2)  the  metaphors  participants  use  to 
describe  implantable  cardiac  devices  and  security  systems  for 
these  devices;  (3)  participants’  evaluations  of  potential  systems 
that represent different directions in technical security design; and 
(4) participants’ views on what security system properties should 
be sought or avoided due to domain-relevant side effects. To be 
clear,  the  purpose  of  this  research  is  not  to  gather  participants’ 
feedback on the security performance of these systems—after all, 
the  participants  are  not  security  experts—but  rather  to  gather 
information  about  how  different  access  control  systems  might 
impact  participants’  jobs  and  their  ability  to  care  for  patients. 
This  information  helps  security  researchers  design  solutions  that 
avoid negative side effects and tailors solutions to the needs of the 
domain.  While  much  of  the  gathered  data  might  be  considered 
common  knowledge  by  those  with  experience  in  the  area,  we 
refine and utilize procedures with which to gather this information 
in a structured manner. 
Contributions from this work are as follows:

to  inform  the  design  of  security  systems,  with  the  goals  of 
increasing  system  adoption,  supporting  correct  usage  of 
security systems, and avoiding negative system side effects.

•  Method. We adapted the Envisioning Workshop method to 
the  security  domain:  we  foregrounded  early-stage  security

a  case  study  for  the  computer  security  community  that 
demonstrates  how  researchers  can  draw  upon  stakeholder 
expertise  to  understand  the  relevant  properties  of  a  new

2.  RELATED WORK 
2.1  Technical Work in IMD Security 
Implantable cardiac devices store information such as the patient’s 
name  and  records  of  irregular  heart  rhythms  that  occurred  since 
the  last  checkup.  Patients  visit  cardiology  clinics  periodically  so 
that medical staff can download information about these episodes 
and  adjust  settings  on  the  patient’s  device.  Current-generation 
cardiac  devices  have  the  ability  to  communicate  wirelessly  with 
external equipment from distances up to 5 meters away.  There are 
numerous  reasons  for  making  IMDs  wireless.  For  example, 
wireless  IMDs  can  be  configured  (“programmed”)  by  doctors  in 
the operating room from farther away, which avoids the need to 
bring  programming  equipment  into  the  sterile  operating  area. 
Wireless technology also allows the IMD to send alerts to a home 
monitoring station—which can then send a report to the patient’s 
physician  for  analysis—without  causing  interruption  to  the 
patient’s  activities.  Unfortunately,  incorporating  a  new  wireless 
interface  for  these  devices  also  increases  the  communication 
surface  on  which  they  can  be  attacked,  and  current  security 
models do not provide access control on a per-device basis. Here 
we provide an overview of prior work on security for IMDs.  
In  2008,  it  was  demonstrated  that  an  implantable  cardiac  device 
with  centimeters-range  wireless  communications  capabilities  can 
be wirelessly compromised by a (nearby) unauthorized party [18]; 
in  2011,  it  was  demonstrated  that  an  implantable  cardiac  device 
with  meters-range  wireless  capabilities  can  also  be  wirelessly 
compromised [15]. Other work has demonstrated vulnerabilities in 
wireless insulin pump systems [23][28]. 
Challenges for securing wireless IMDs and possible directions for 
improving  future  security  have  been  outlined  [17].  One  key 
challenge  is  to  balance  security  (blocking  inappropriate  access) 
while also providing some guarantee that safety can be ensured in 
an  emergency  (facilitating  appropriate  situational  access).  To 
illustrate this point, consider a security system in which the IMD 
only grants wireless access to individuals who know a password, 
such  as  the  patient’s  regular  cardiologist.  While  such  a  system 
does  improve  security  and  can  prevent  unauthorized  access  by 
random  individuals,  this  system  also  directly  and  negatively 
impacts  safety:  emergency  personnel  will  not  be  able  to  read  or 
change settings on the device without first contacting the patient’s 
cardiologist, who might be unreachable.  
There have been numerous early-stage proposals to help improve 
security while prioritizing medical access. One proposed direction 
requires the patient to wear a wristband that protects the security 
of the IMD when worn, but that can be removed for emergency 
access [8][15][1]. Another direction requires body modifications, 
such  as  RFID  implants  or  tattoos  with  visible  or  UV-visible  ink 
[32]. Yet another direction requires the doctor to place something 
on  or  near  the  patient  in  order  to  activate  longer-range  wireless 
techniques 
capabilities (e.g., [3][30][37]), taking advantage of cryptographic 
distance-bounding, 
intra-body  signaling,  or  physiologically-
derived  keys.  Drawing  from  past  work,  an  IMD  could  also
