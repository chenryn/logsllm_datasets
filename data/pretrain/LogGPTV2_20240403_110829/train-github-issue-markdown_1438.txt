Hopefully this is not a duplicate (couldn't find anything). Out of all the
"less desirable" VS (and VS code as well) plugin behaviors I've found this to
be the number one most disturbing:

And after fixing the return type (only changed `PromiseX.start` to
`PromiseX.start`):

**Reduced test case**
    function func(f: () => number) {
    }
    func(() => {
        let x = "HI"; //  number) {
    }
    func(function() { // `) could also work (I tried to find a solution that would
work with all variations of the arrow notation, e.g. including reduced
notation like `val => val * 2`). This would be significantly less distracting
and wouldn't mask other errors within the function scope.
On a more personal note, I would be super-thankful if this would be fixed!
This happens very frequently when using callback or promise heavy code (I mean
sometimes up to hundreds of times per day).
