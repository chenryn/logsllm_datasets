This is a copy http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1932 since that one
seems no longer in use and no one responded to it in almost 2 years, even
though I posted a patch that solves the problem....
I have been trying to use the f2py routinely to build an interface around the
ECMWF BUFR library. See http://code.google.com/p/pybufr-ecmwf/ for details.
This works fine for the python 2.x versions.
However, I also tried to add the possibility to use python3 and here I
encountered some trouble. My python code converts properly to python3 using to
2to3 tool, but when I try to use the python3 version of f2py I encounter this
error somewhere deep inside the f2py internals:

I any additional information is needed I would be happy to provide it.
