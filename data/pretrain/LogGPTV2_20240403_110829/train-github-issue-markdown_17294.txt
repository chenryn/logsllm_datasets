This issue is a continuation of the one reported at [http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1932](http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/1932), which appears to be no longer in use. Despite posting a patch that resolves the problem, there has been no response for almost two years.

I have been using f2py to build an interface around the ECMWF BUFR library. For more details, please see [http://code.google.com/p/pybufr-ecmwf/](http://code.google.com/p/pybufr-ecmwf/). This setup works well with Python 2.x versions.

However, I encountered difficulties when attempting to add support for Python 3. My Python code successfully converts to Python 3 using the `2to3` tool. However, when I try to use the Python 3 version of f2py, I encounter the following error deep within the f2py internals:

```

If any additional information is needed, I would be happy to provide it.
