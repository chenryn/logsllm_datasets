tennas with a 25dBi standard gain horn antenna from Flann
Microwave [3], with 3dB beamwidth of 10◦. For our mea-
surements, we read RSS values from an SNMP-based soft-
ware monitor running on the radio. Since currently available
60 GHz radios all transmit at a single ﬁxed data rate, we de-
rive link throughput by converting RSS values to data rates
according to the 802.11ad standard [6].1
2.2 Current Limitations
Despite the many tangible beneﬁts of adding 60 GHz links
to a data center, there are two notable limitations with cur-

6.76Gbps). Following its receiver sensitivity table, which guaran-
tees 1% packet error rate and assumes 10dB noise ﬁgure and 5dB
additional implementation loss, we derive the required SNR for
each data rate. We then compute the measured SNR from each
measured RSS and noise, and use the above mapping to derive
the data rate supported by each measured RSS value.
rent designs. Here we discuss each in detail and use data
from our testbed to quantify its impact.
Link Blockage.
Link blockage is a limiting factor for
60 GHz links. The 5mm wavelength of these links means
that any object larger than 2.5 mm can eﬀectively block
signals or reﬂect them, producing multipath fading and de-
grading transmission rates [37]. In today’s data centers, this
is problematic because racks are organized in a grid, and
transceivers and antennas on one rack can easily block trans-
missions on another rack. This has led to current designs
limiting themselves to connecting neighboring racks [23, 27]
(see Figure 1(c)).
We measure the severity of the problem by placing multi-
ple antennas between two 60 GHz endpoints, and observing
performance degradation on the link. We examine cases
for both intra- and inter-row rack communications (see Fig-
ure 2(a)).
In our intra-row case, antennas are separated by
a ﬁxed distance of 0.6m (roughly one rack width). Thus, a
link blocked by k antennas, i.e. T X → RXk, has a distance
of (k + 1)·0.6m. We vary the number of blocking antennas
in the experiment, and show the diﬀerence in performances
with and without blocking antennas. Figure 2(b) shows the
RSS degradation and data rate loss. Clearly, even when
there is only one blocking antenna (link distance = 1.2m),
RSS degradation can be as high as 10dB. Since the signal
strength is still high, RSS degradation does not reduce data
rates. As the number of antennas increases, the RSS degra-
dation becomes more severe and data rates drop quickly:
3 antennas (link distance = 2.4m) can cause a 25dB RSS
degradation and 50% data rate loss, while 6 blocking anten-
nas (link distance = 4.2m) can cause a 30dB RSS degrada-
tion and nearly 90% data rate loss.
For inter-row communications, antennas are separated by
a ﬁxed distance of 3.6m (one rack length of 1.2m plus one
row separation of 2.4m) [23]. Results in Figure 2(c) show
similar trends as the intra-row case, except that the impact
of blockage is slightly lower. This is because the RF beam
emitted by the horn antenna propagates in a cone-shape.
The closer the ﬁrst blocking antenna is to the transmitter,
the more the signal it blocks from the receiver. Overall, our
measurement results clearly demonstrate that link blockages
cause severe problems for 60 GHz transmissions.
To reduce link blockage, one option is to intelligently place
radios on each racks, which might be eﬀective for some rack
pair connections. To connect racks dynamically, however,
the radios must tune to diﬀerent directions and still block

Figure 3: Our experiment to examine the impact of link interference using 2D beamforming. We place a
transmitter T X in the middle of a rack row as the interfering transmitter, a receiver RX in the next rack row
as its receiver, and four additional rack rows as victims. Each victim radio, in red, points its antenna to the
rack of its neighboring row to the left, representing the receiver of an inter-row link of link distance 3.6m.
In each rack we list the SINR degradation and data rate loss due to the interference from T X. We omit the
results at racks whose SINR degradation is less than 1dB.
transmissions. Another option is to place racks in a hexag-
onal conﬁguration [41]. While this approach leads to ineﬃ-
cient space use, it also does not solve the fundamental link
blockage problem. Finally, multi-hop connections between
non-neighboring racks would increase end-to-end delay, dra-
matically reduce throughput, and produce potential bottle-
necks at racks congested by forwarding traﬃc from multiple
links.
Despite the use of beamforming
Radio Interference.
to bound the transmission energy in a “narrow” direction,
radio interference remains an issue for these systems. Radio
design artifacts will still produce signal leaks outside of the
intended direction [29, 40]. When placed in a dense rack
formation, leakage produces harmful interference between
nearby links and limits the density of concurrent links.
Using our testbed, we measure the impact of interference
produced by a single transmission, in the presence of an-
tenna blockage. As shown in Figure 3, we place a 60GHz
transmitter (TX) in the middle of the data center, and mea-
sure the RSS at 27 racks (in red) located in four neighboring
rows. At each of these 27 racks, the radio points its antenna
to the rack of its immediately left row, representing the re-
ceiver of an inter-row link with link distance of 3.6m and
SNR of 31dB. This experiment allows us to measure the
interference experienced by each of the 27 inter-row links
when TX is transmitting, from which we compute the SINR
degradation and data rate loss due to interference. Results
in Figure 3 show that despite the fact that TX’s interference
signal is blocked by various antennas, 15 inter-row links be-
hind the destination still observe 5-20dB degradation in their
SINR. 8 of these links suﬀer 20-49% data loss.
The spread of radio interference signiﬁcantly limits the
number of concurrent wireless links in a data center. One
option is to separate the links in the frequency domain. But
this reduces the per-link capacity, since the total available
bandwidth is ﬁxed across the frequency range. Alternatively,
data center managers can increase the spacing between racks
to reduce interference. But this leads to ineﬃcient space and
power usage, and weakens long-distance links.
2.3 Solution: 3D Beamforming
To address these limitations, we propose 3D beamforming,
a new beamforming approach that leverages ceiling reﬂec-
tions to connect racks wirelessly. An example is shown in
Figure 1(d), where a transmitter bounces its signal oﬀ of the
ceiling to the receiver. This creates an indirect line-of-sight
path between the sender and receiver, bypassing obstacles2
and reducing interference footprint.
To align its antenna for a transmission, the sender only
needs to know the physical location of the receiver rack, and
point to a position on the ceiling directly between the two
racks. This is because all racks (and their 60 GHz radio
antennas) are of the same height.
3D beamforming requires three hardware components:
• Beamforming Radios: We reuse beamforming radios [8,
23] and adjust beam directions in both azimuth and ele-
vation by placing the horn antennas on rotators. Existing
rotators can achieve an accuracy of 0.006◦-0.09◦ [4, 7].
• Ceiling Reﬂectors: Reﬂectors on the ceiling act as spec-
ular mirrors to reﬂect signals. Our experiments conﬁrm
prior work [12, 36] showing that ﬂat metal plates oﬀer
perfect specular reﬂection without degrading energy or
changing path loss characteristics.
• Electromagnetic Absorbers: We place electromagnetic ab-
sorbers [12] near each antenna to prevent any local reﬂec-
tion and scattering. These inexpensive absorbers require
no maintenance.
3D beamforming largely addresses both of the main limi-
tations with existing 2D 60 GHz proposals. First, by bounc-
ing beams oﬀ a reﬂective ceiling, it dramatically reduces the
interference region for wireless links and allows deployment
in densely packed data centers. Second, the reﬂective path
avoids obstacles and creates eﬀective line-of-sight paths be-
tween most or all rack pairs in a common 250-rack data cen-
ter. Addressing these issues means we can connect most or
all rack pairs using single-hop 60 GHz links, thus maximizing
bandwidth and eliminating forwarding delays. It also means
a large number of links can be active in a small area without
causing mutual interference and limiting performance.
In this paper, we present ﬁrst steps in building ﬂexible
wireless links using 3D beamforming. We identify and ad-
dress practical issues in the physical and link layers, and
describe experience and experimental results from a local 60
2Here we assume that there are no obstacles between top of racks
(or containers) and the ceiling. For instance, this might require
mounting the radios above cable trays, though we leave a detailed
study of physical deployment to future work.

GHz 3D beamforming testbed. We limit our discussion of
3D beamforming as a general link-layer primitive, and leave
for future work other issues such as routing, traﬃc man-
agement, and wired/wireless co-scheduling. We believe this
work addresses a few of the key concerns associated with
large-scale wireless data center deployments, principally en-
abling substantially more bandwidth to be delivered more
ﬂexibly in the data center. However, many open questions
remain before we expect to see large-scale deployments.
3. MICROBENCHMARK RESULTS
Using detailed hardware experiments, we now examine the
key properties of 3D beamforming, and compare them to 2D
systems. We focus speciﬁcally on physical performance char-
acteristics of our approach, and its sensitivity to factors such
as radio density, rotator accuracy, and reﬂection material.
3D Beamforming Testbed.
As shown by Figure 4,
our local testbed consists of two 60GHz beamforming radios
from HXI (described in Section 2), a 4ft×8ft metal reﬂector,
and RF absorbers from ETS-Lindgren [2]. We test two types
of reﬂectors: commercial-grade mirror-quality stainless steel
plates and oﬀ-the-shelf cheap galvanized steel sheets from
our local home improvement store. To assist with rapid
experimentation, we mount the reﬂector vertically on a mo-
bile platform that stands in parallel to a line connecting
the center of the two radio transceivers. We vertically align
platform using multiple hanging plumb-bobs. The corre-
sponding ceiling height h is the perpendicular distance be-
tween the reﬂector and the line. To prevent reﬂected signals
from producing more reﬂections at the receiver side, we place
RF absorbers under the antenna. The absorber is a surface
tiled with small pyramids 7.5cm thick.
It does not block
3D transmit/reﬂection paths, but eliminates additional re-
ﬂections. Finally, instead of using rotators, we manually
calibrate the orientations of the horn antennas, using high
precision laser pointers for guidance. We also manually in-
troduce calibration errors to emulate the use of rotators of
diﬀerent precision (Section 3.3).
We performed detailed experiments in two indoor envi-
ronments: a 10m×10m conference room and a 20m×26m
pavilion room.
3.1 Validating Physical Properties
Our ﬁrst question is a basic one: “does 3D beamforming
work, and what is the impact of reﬂection on signal strength
and interference characteristics?”
Property 1: Extended Link Connectivity. Our ﬁrst
experiment looks at link connectivity. Intuitively, using ceil-
ing reﬂection, 3D beamforming will bypass obstacles in the
horizontal plane, eliminating the antenna blockage problem
of its 2D counterpart. More importantly, since ceiling re-
ﬂectors should produce no loss [12, 36], it should produce
an indirect LOS path following the free-space propagation
model [23, 32]:
Pr =
PtGtGrλ2
(4π)2(L2 + 4h2)
(1)
where Pt and Pr are the transmit and receive power, Gt and
Gr are the transmit and receive beamforming antenna gains,
λ is the radio wavelength, L is the distance between the
sender and receiver, and h is the distance from the antenna
to the ceiling. To verify our hypothesis, we measure RSS at
diﬀerent link distances for both 2D (with no obstacles) and
3D beamforming. We also vary the ceiling height h between
2m and 3m.
The results conﬁrm our hypothesis. Figure 5(a) plots
the measured RSS as the function of the propagation path
length, i.e. L for 2D and √L2 + 4h2 for 3D beamforming.
As a point of reference, we also plot the free-space model in
(1). We make three key observations. First, our measure-
ment results match the model, conﬁrming that both beam-
forming methods follow the free-space propagation model,
and that the reﬂector introduces no energy loss. Second, a
mirror-quality stainless steel plate and a cheap galvanized
steel sheet both oﬀer perfect reﬂection. Third, we found no
visible diﬀerence between the results collected in the two
rooms.
We also verify 3D beamforming’s ability of bypassing ob-
stacles in the 2D plane by placing absorbers along the line
connecting the two radios. The height of the absorber is
similar to that of the horn antenna. We observe no diﬀer-
ence in RSS even for the longest link distance achievable in
the two rooms (30m).
