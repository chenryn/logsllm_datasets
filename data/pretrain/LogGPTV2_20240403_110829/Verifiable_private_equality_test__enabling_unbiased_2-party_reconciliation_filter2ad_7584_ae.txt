and 1024-bit moduli. The cardinality of the ordered sets
was varied from 10 to 200 in steps of 10 such that the input
sets for both parties were disjoint (i.e., to force worst-case
behavior). For each set size, the runtime was averaged over
10 randomly generated sets.
As predicted and shown in [38, 36], all protocols exhibit
a quadratic behavior in the worst-case. It is clear that the
eﬃcient DT10 PSI enables the construction of an eﬃcient
PROS protocol in the semi-honest model. Compared to
DT10, our protocol with security in the malicious model
exhibits an approximate overhead factor of 5.6.
It is im-
portant to note that the requirement to do each comparison
twice to make our new protocol mutual already amounts to
an overhead factor of two. In conclusion, VPET enables the
eﬃcient construction of mutual higher-level protocols in the
malicious model.
Average-Case.
For our performance tests we deﬁned the average-case in-
put as both parties having a fraction of set elements in com-
mon. These common elements may be at random positions
within the ordered sets. The ordered sets for both parties
were generated such that both have exactly 5% of their el-
ements in common. To obtain the results in Figure 10, the
set size was varied from 20 to 420 in steps of 20. For each set
size, the runtime was averaged over 100 randomly generated
sets. Similar to the results in [36], the average case shows a
linear complexity. Compared to the worst-case, the runtime
for all three PROS protocols is signiﬁcantly reduced. As ex-
pected, the overhead factor of our construction compared to
the DT10-based variant remains at approximately 5.6.
6. RELATED WORK
The ﬁrst solution for PSI was proposed by Freedman et
al. based on oblivious polynomial evaluation and homomor-
phic encryption [23]. Freedman’s protocol provides security
in the presence of semi-honest adversaries. It was later im-
proved with security against malicious adversaries by several
authors [12, 17, 29].

evaluation,
is oblivious pseudo-random function (OPRF)
evaluation. The applicability of OPRF to the PSI prob-
lem was ﬁrst suggested in [24]. Hazay and Lindell were
the ﬁrst to introduce eﬃcient protocols, one with security
in the presence of covert adversaries and one with security
against malicious servers and semi-honest clients [27]. More
recently, the OPRF approach was extended to exhibit active
security in the common reference string model [30]. Finally,
a similar idea based on an unpredictable function was pro-
posed in [31].
Recently, De Cristofaro et al. presented a novel approach
for PSI based on the comparison of blinded values [20, 19].
Their solution has linear complexity and the authors pro-
pose protocols with security in the semi-honest as well as in
the malicious model. The blinding technique applied in [19]
is similar to the one used in our construction of the VPET
protocol. However, their approach does not involve com-
mitments and it therefore does not enable proofs about the
correct usage of inputs.
Similarly, a variety of protocols providing diﬀerent secu-
rity guarantees have been proposed for PET. Fagin et al.
have surveyed multiple techniques which can be used to de-
termine whether two people are thinking about the same
person [21].
In [43], Naor et al. present a solution for
PET using oblivious polynomial evaluation which is based
on oblivious transfer. Boudot et al. approached the problem
with the goal of designing a fair, i.e., mutual, solution. Their
protocol provides security under the discrete logarithm as-
sumption [7]. More recently, Damgard et al. proposed a
protocol based on a bit-decomposition scheme [18] which
was later improved on by Nishide et al. [45]. In [32], Murat
et al. utilize threshold homomorphic encryption and zero
knowledge proofs to construct a PET protocol with security
in the malicious model.
Finally, Lipmaa et al. propose a veriﬁable homomor-
phic oblivious transfer protocol which is sender-private [34].
Their protocol enables a sender to commit to all elements in
its database. Subsequently, these values then can be related
to other values used in the computation.
7. FUTURE WORK
Future work includes the enhancement of VPET to en-
able arbitrary comparisons which are not limited to equality
tests. In addition, we plan to extend our new VPET and
PROS protocols to the multi-party setting.
