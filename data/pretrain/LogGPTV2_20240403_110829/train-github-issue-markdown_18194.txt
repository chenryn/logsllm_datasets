**Current behavior**  
Making a GET request with no body results in an exception of "Cannot read
property 'toString' of null".
It seems in the commit `e7a8e27` the text function now doesn't do the
`isPresent(this._body)` `e7a8e27`#diff-c9b22b9d241f7ed55d13b39d1ccb333bL109
check causing the failure
It now falls through to here
`e7a8e27`#diff-1239ed5b0c3fa3d870cb4005226ed5d6R56 when null causing the
error.
**Expected/desired behavior**  
Should be able to send a HTTP GET request with no request body.
**Reproduction of the problem**  
So far, making a HTTP get request with an empty body reproduces the issue.
**What is the expected behavior?**  
Should be able to send a HTTP GET request with no request body.
