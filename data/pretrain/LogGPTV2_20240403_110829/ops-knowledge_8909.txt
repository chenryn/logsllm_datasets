User: How to backup and restore MongoDB database, provide a detailed backup plan.
Assistant: MongoDB is a non-relational database. You need to pay attention to the following points when backing up and restoring: 1. When backing up data, you should consider the status of the entire MongoDB cluster to ensure that the backup data is complete. 2. It is necessary to stop the write operation and check before backup to ensure that the backup data is correct. 3. The backup needs to specify the appropriate path and file name. 4. Before restoring, you need to ensure that the state of MongoDB is consistent with the state at the time of backup, including port, path address, etc. The following is the backup and recovery plan: Backup: 1. Use the mongodump command to back up all databases mongoexport -h <host>:<port> -u <user> -p <password> --authenticationDatabase <authDB> --db <database> - -collection <collection> --out <file-path> 2. Use the mongorestore command to restore the backup mongorestore -h <host>:<port> -u <user> -p <password> --authenticationDatabase <authDB> <dir-path > Note: The above commands need to be modified accordingly according to the specific environment and needs. Pay attention to the correctness of data such as path and file name when backing up and restoring. Backup and recovery can be performed under multiple virtual machines or computers, and backup files can also be exported to other devices for local recovery.
