`assert.strictEqual(false, anyArgument)` triggers unreachable code error for
any code below **after the recent @types/node update**. This **only**
reproduces with `@types/node` 10.17.24, 12.12.41, 13.13.8 (published
recently).
Note that it only reproduces with `false` as a value being checked. Replace it
with anything else and it will compile.
This looks to me like a `tsc` problem rather than types problem (I reported it
in microsoft/TypeScript#38699) but the fastest fix would be rolling back the
`@types/node` changes, so I'm duplicating the issue here as well.
**TypeScript Version:** 3.9.3, also reproduces on 3.8.x
**Code**
    import * as assert from 'assert';
    const b = false;
    assert.strictEqual(false, b);
    console.log('really unreachable?');
**Expected behavior:** should compile with `--allowUnreachableCode false`.
**Actual behavior:**
    $ npx tsc --allowUnreachableCode false src/index.ts 
    src/index.ts:5:1 - error TS7027: Unreachable code detected.
    5 console.log('really unreachable?');
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Found 1 error.
This looks to be directly caused by recent releases of `@types/node` with this
commit `e910379` included.
  * I tried using the `@types/xxxx` package and had problems.
  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
  * I have a question that is inappropriate for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
