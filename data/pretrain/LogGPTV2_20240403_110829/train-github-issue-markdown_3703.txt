### Issue Description

After a recent update to `@types/node`, the following assertion:

```typescript
assert.strictEqual(false, anyArgument);
```

triggers an "unreachable code" error for any code that follows. This issue is specific to certain versions of `@types/node` (10.17.24, 12.12.41, and 13.13.8), which were published recently.

### Reproduction Steps

1. **TypeScript Version:** 3.9.3 (also reproducible on 3.8.x)
2. **Code:**

    ```typescript
    import * as assert from 'assert';
    const b = false;
    assert.strictEqual(false, b);
    console.log('really unreachable?');
    ```

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The code should compile with the `--allowUnreachableCode false` flag.
   
4. **Actual Behavior:**
   - Compilation fails with the following error:
     ```sh
     $ npx tsc --allowUnreachableCode false src/index.ts
     src/index.ts:5:1 - error TS7027: Unreachable code detected.
     5 console.log('really unreachable?');
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     Found 1 error.
     ```

### Observations

- The issue only occurs when `false` is used as the value being checked in the `assert.strictEqual` call. Replacing `false` with any other value allows the code to compile without errors.
- This appears to be a problem with the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) rather than a type definition issue. I have reported this in [microsoft/TypeScript#38699](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/38699).
- The fastest fix would be to roll back the changes in `@types/node`.

### Additional Information

- **TypeScript Version:** 3.9.3 (also reproducible on 3.8.x)
- **@types/node Versions Affected:** 10.17.24, 12.12.41, 13.13.8
- **Commit Causing the Issue:** [e910379](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/commit/e910379)

### Troubleshooting Steps

- I tried using the latest stable version of TypeScript (as per [npmjs.com/package/typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)).
- I attempted to use the `@types/xxxx` package but encountered issues.
- I have a question that is not suitable for StackOverflow. (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
