User: I've tried many variations of this command: idle.py -e filepath, but it simply starts IDLE like normal, not opening any extra windows for editing, and not throwing any errors.
So how can I do the equivalent of opening IDLE, file>open>filepath via the command line (or perhaps even a Python module)?
Assistant: first make sure you have location of idle  in path
 I am using "python3.5".So mine looks like this: 
C:\Program Files\Python35\Lib\idlelib.Yours may differ.
use this following command:idle -r file_name.py to run the file
or just idle file_name.py to edit
or start idle -r file_name.py ^&exit
