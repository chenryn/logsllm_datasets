I understand that you're trying to open a specific file in IDLE using the command line, but the `idle.py -e filepath` command is not working as expected. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve the equivalent of opening IDLE and then selecting "File > Open > filepath" from the command line or through a Python module.

### Steps to Open a File in IDLE via Command Line

1. **Ensure IDLE is in Your System Path:**
   - First, make sure that the path to the IDLE executable is included in your system's PATH environment variable. The exact location may vary depending on your Python installation.
   - For example, if you are using Python 3.5, the path might be:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Program Files\Python35\Lib\idlelib
     ```
   - You can add this path to your system's PATH environment variable to ensure that the `idle` command is recognized.

2. **Open a File for Editing:**
   - To open a specific file in IDLE for editing, use the following command:
     ```sh
     idle file_name.py
     ```
   - Replace `file_name.py` with the path to your file. This should open IDLE and load the specified file for editing.

3. **Run a File:**
   - If you want to run the file directly, you can use the `-r` option:
     ```sh
     idle -r file_name.py
     ```
   - This will open IDLE, run the file, and then exit.

4. **Running IDLE and Exiting:**
   - If you want to run the file and then exit IDLE, you can use the following command (on Windows):
     ```sh
     start idle -r file_name.py & exit
     ```
   - This command will start IDLE, run the file, and then close the command prompt window.

### Example

- Suppose you have a file named `example.py` located at `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.py`.

- To open this file in IDLE for editing, you would use:
  ```sh
  idle C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.py
  ```

- To run the file and then exit IDLE, you would use:
  ```sh
  idle -r C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.py
  ```

- To run the file and then exit both IDLE and the command prompt, you would use:
  ```sh
  start idle -r C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.py & exit
  ```

By following these steps, you should be able to open and edit files in IDLE directly from the command line.
