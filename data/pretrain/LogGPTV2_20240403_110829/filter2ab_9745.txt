### Title: BlackHat US-21: Chip Chop - Smashing the Mobile Phone Secure Chip for Fun and Digital Forensics

**Abstract:**

Embedded Secure Elements (eSE) are hardware security modules integrated into mobile phones to enhance the security of critical system features and encrypted user data. On Android, these components are often referred to as "strongbox" or "tamper-resistant hardware" (TRH). The eSE is designed to remain secure even if the rest of the system is compromised, and it is engineered to withstand both logical and physical attacks, including side-channel attacks.

In this presentation, we will discuss how we adapted state-of-the-art attacks to the eSE platform and present a remote attack on a Common Criteria EAL 5+ (AVA_VAN.5) certified eSE by Samsung, specifically the S3K250AF, which is found in premium mobile models with the Exynos chipset (such as the Galaxy S20 and Note 20). We discovered a critical 0-day vulnerability that, when exploited, leads to a complete compromise of all eSE security goals and a total loss of future trust in the eSE. This is particularly challenging to mitigate in devices already in the field, as our attack exposed the embedded AES key used for encrypted firmware updates.

Our eSE attack is executed using the eSE's logical APDU communication and can be performed remotely by an attacker who has root access to the Rich Execution Environment (REE). Ongoing research aims to remove the requirement for rooted REE, such as through chip-off/on attacks on the eSE and brute force attacks using tools like Rubber Ducky or similar devices.

The ultimate result of our research facilitates digital forensic acquisition of affected devices in a before-first-unlock (BFU) state. We demonstrate how to conduct off-device brute force attacks on user screen lock credentials. Our findings highlight the gap between intended and achieved security, undermining the trust placed in certifications.

**Vulnerability Patch:**
The vulnerability has been patched (CVE-2020-28341 / SVE-2020-18632).
