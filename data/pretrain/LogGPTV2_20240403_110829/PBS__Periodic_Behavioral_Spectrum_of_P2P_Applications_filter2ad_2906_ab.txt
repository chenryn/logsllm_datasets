Fig. 5. Zout[i], ACF and FFT transformation results for a BitTorrent session
The third step is similar to the algorithms in SG1 and SG2. The time-domain
sequences Zin[i] and Zout[i] represent the total number of SEs and EEs of all
the in-ﬂows and out-ﬂows triggered in the ith time interval respectively.
Figure 5 shows Zout[i], ACF and FFT transformation results for a BitTorrent
session (N = 200, packet number threshold = 10, interval threshold = 4). Theo-
retically, the value of interval threshold, which determines the start and end of
subﬂows, is likely to aﬀect the frequency characteristics of the sequence. The
larger the value is, the fewer number of events will be triggered and there is a
higher probability that the application frequency will be buried by noise. So,
interval threshold should take a relatively small value.
In 5(c), we observe that there are four frequencies with large FFT values.
In fact, the frequency points f1 = 0.035Hz and f2 = 0.1Hz are the frequency
characteristics caused by choking (every 10 second) and optimistic unchoking
(every 30 second). The remaining two frequencies, (f3 = 0.135Hz and f4 =
0.2Hz) are the harmonic frequencies, which are the linear combination of the
basic frequencies 0.1Hz and 0.035Hz.
4 Frequency Characteristics of Popular P2P Applications
In this section, we present the experimental results of the frequency charac-
teristics of several popular P2P applications. These characteristics are derived
from the frequency-domain analysis (as discussed in Section 3) of the real packet
traces that we captured in a controlled environment.
Packets are captured using Wireshark[2] and each experiment lasts for 30
minutes. When we run each P2P application, we turn oﬀ all other network
applications running on the target machine. In Table 1, we list the frequency
characteristics of 15 popular P2P applications and periodic behavioral spectrum
(PBS). We also selectively plot the FFTs of these applications in Figure 6. For

Fig. 6. FFT results of nine selective P2P applications
each P2P application, we ran multiple experiments (with diﬀerent settings) and
analyzed the resulting packet trace to double check whether its frequency char-
acteristics showed up every time. For example, for PPLive streaming application,
we repeated experiments over six times on diﬀerent channels of three popular-
ity levels, at least twice per level: the most popular, moderately popular and
the least popular. The results conﬁrmed that the traﬃc exhibited the same fre-
quency characteristics irrespective of a popularity level. In addition, for some of
the applications (e.g., PPlive, PPStream), we also carry out the measurement
under another controlled environment in which the computer accessed to the
Internet was through ADSL instead of the campus Ethernet. Results showed
that we could still ﬁnd the frequency characteristics but the magnitude of FFT
values at those frequency points were a bit smaller.
Table 1 shows that most P2P applications have unique fundamental frequen-
cies. Exceptions are PPLive Streaming and TVAnt Streaming, which interest-
ingly share the same frequency characteristics. We believe that the PBS shown
in Table 1 can serve as a new form of signatures for classifying P2P applications
from mixed packet trace.
Let us present some identiﬁcation results from the mixed traﬃc traces col-
lected from our department gateway. The packet header information of each
packet was required by the PBS-based approach, but the payload was only used
for validation. The measurement duration was two days. After applying the

PBS-based identiﬁcation approach, four P2P applications were found and they
were PPStream, PPLive, eMule and BitTorrent. We then used a combined
method including payload signature checking and manual analysis for valida-
tion. The validation results showed that the heuristic approach worked well (with
100% accuracy). Although the PBS-based approach is a prototype in the current
stage, we believe that the application of the PBS is promising and valuable.
5 Related Works
The tremendous growth of P2P traﬃc has drawn much attention from researchers.
Several studies emphasize on identiﬁcation of P2P traﬃc, such as the signature-
based payload method in [14] and identifying by transport layer characteristics [8].
Recently, a novel approach named BLINC is proposed by Karagiannis et al. [9].
Although both BLINC and our approach are host-level methods, there is a signif-
icant diﬀerence between them. BLINC focuses on the behaviors of a host’s con-
nection patterns (spatial behaviors) while ours focuses on the periodic behaviors
of a given host (temporal behaviors). Moore et al. in [11] apply Bayesian analy-
sis techniques to categorize traﬃc by application. They also apply FFT to build
discriminators [12], but the diﬀerence is that their method focuses on each single
ﬂow, i.e., applying FFT on the interarrival time of packets belonging to a single
ﬂow. Our approach, on the other hand, focuses on the host-level behaviors and we
inspect the periodicity of all ﬂows related to the same host.

6 Conclusion
In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce three periodic communication patterns that
most P2P applications have and provide concrete justiﬁcations. Then we present
a novel approach called Two Phase Transformation to measure and discover
these periodic behaviors of P2P applications. We carry out a large number of
experiments applying this approach on several popular P2P applications (such
as PPLive, PPStream, eMule etc.), and show the results of diﬀerent frequency
characteristics of P2P applications. These frequency characteristics can form
a periodic behavioral spectrum (PBS), which can be used as a new form of
signatures to help to monitor and identify P2P traﬃc.
