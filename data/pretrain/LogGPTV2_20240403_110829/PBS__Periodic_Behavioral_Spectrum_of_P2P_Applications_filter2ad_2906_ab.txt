### Figure 5: Zout[i], ACF, and FFT Transformation Results for a BitTorrent Session

**Figure 5** illustrates the results of the Zout[i] sequence, its Autocorrelation Function (ACF), and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for a BitTorrent session. The parameters used are \( N = 200 \), packet number threshold = 10, and interval threshold = 4.

- **(a) Zout[i]**: This represents the total number of events (SEs and EEs) of all out-flows triggered in the \( i \)-th time interval.
- **(b) rZout(n)**: The ACF of Zout[i].
- **(c) |RZout(k/N)|**: The magnitude of the FFT of Zout[i].

**Theoretical Considerations:**
The value of the interval threshold, which determines the start and end of subflows, can significantly affect the frequency characteristics of the sequence. A larger interval threshold reduces the number of triggered events, potentially burying the application's frequency characteristics in noise. Therefore, a smaller interval threshold is generally preferred.

**Frequency Analysis:**
In **Figure 5(c)**, four frequencies with significant FFT values are observed:
- \( f_1 = 0.035 \) Hz and \( f_2 = 0.1 \) Hz: These frequencies correspond to choking (every 10 seconds) and optimistic unchoking (every 30 seconds).
- \( f_3 = 0.135 \) Hz and \( f_4 = 0.2 \) Hz: These are harmonic frequencies, resulting from the linear combination of the fundamental frequencies \( 0.1 \) Hz and \( 0.035 \) Hz.

### 4. Frequency Characteristics of Popular P2P Applications

This section presents the experimental results of the frequency characteristics of several popular P2P applications. These characteristics are derived from the frequency-domain analysis of real packet traces captured in a controlled environment.

**Experimental Setup:**
- Packet capture was performed using Wireshark [2].
- Each experiment lasted for 30 minutes.
- All other network applications on the target machine were turned off during the experiments.

**Table 1** lists the frequency characteristics of 15 popular P2P applications and their Periodic Behavioral Spectrum (PBS). **Figure 6** selectively plots the FFTs of these applications.

**Validation:**
For each P2P application, multiple experiments with different settings were conducted to verify the consistency of the frequency characteristics. For example, for PPLive streaming, experiments were repeated over six times on different channels of three popularity levels (most popular, moderately popular, and least popular). The results confirmed that the traffic exhibited the same frequency characteristics regardless of the popularity level. Additionally, for some applications (e.g., PPlive, PPStream), measurements were also conducted in an environment where the computer accessed the Internet via ADSL instead of the campus Ethernet. The results showed that the frequency characteristics were still present, but the magnitude of the FFT values at those frequency points was slightly smaller.

**Key Findings:**
- Most P2P applications have unique fundamental frequencies.
- Exceptions include PPLive Streaming and TVAnt Streaming, which share the same frequency characteristics.
- The PBS shown in Table 1 can serve as a new form of signatures for classifying P2P applications from mixed packet traces.

**Mixed Traffic Identification:**
We applied the PBS-based approach to mixed traffic traces collected from our department gateway. The packet header information was required, while the payload was only used for validation. The measurement duration was two days. After applying the PBS-based identification, four P2P applications were identified: PPStream, PPLive, eMule, and BitTorrent. Validation using payload signature checking and manual analysis confirmed 100% accuracy.

### 5. Related Works

The rapid growth of P2P traffic has attracted significant research attention. Several studies focus on P2P traffic identification, such as the signature-based payload method [14] and transport layer characteristics [8]. Recently, Karagiannis et al. [9] proposed BLINC, a novel host-level method. While both BLINC and our approach are host-level, BLINC focuses on spatial behaviors (connection patterns), whereas ours focuses on temporal behaviors (periodic patterns). Moore et al. [11, 12] use Bayesian analysis and FFT to categorize traffic, but their method applies FFT to the interarrival time of packets in a single flow, whereas our approach examines the periodicity of all flows related to the same host.

### 6. Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced three periodic communication patterns common to most P2P applications and provided justifications. We then presented a novel approach called Two-Phase Transformation to measure and discover these periodic behaviors. Extensive experiments on popular P2P applications (e.g., PPLive, PPStream, eMule) demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in revealing different frequency characteristics. These characteristics form a Periodic Behavioral Spectrum (PBS), which can be used as a new form of signatures to monitor and identify P2P traffic.
