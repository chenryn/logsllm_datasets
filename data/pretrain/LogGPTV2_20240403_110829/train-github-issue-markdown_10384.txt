Pods with RestartPolicyNever are leaving behind infra pods. Those infra pods
should be nuked as soon as the last successful run is completed.
For people with lots of successful / failed never pods this consumes IP
addresses which is bad when IP addresses are in use.
I suspect this is because we don't have another marker that the pod has
completed, but we probably need to get that fixed before 1.0.
