My application is hosted in Microsoft Azure. I have tried to implement
automatic updated using squirrel or auto-updater. But none of them is working.  
Also I have gone through various articles provided in internet but none of
them using Azure.  
So, can you please help me out how to implement auto update feature in my
electron app using Azure.
