During the work on issue #12910, I added a new `Job` resource in the `pkg/expapi` package. While generating the necessary conversions for this resource, I encountered the functions `convert_v1_PodSpec_To_api_PodSpec` and `convert_api_PodSpec_To_v1_PodSpec`, which are manually implemented in `pkg/api/v1/conversion.go`. This has led to compilation errors.

To resolve this, I have temporarily copied these functions into `pkg/expapi/v1/conversion.go` as part of the PR. However, I am aware that this is not the ideal solution.

Could you please advise on the correct approach to handle this situation?
