That came up during working on #12910. I'm adding new `Job` resource in
`pkg/expapi` and while generating conversions for that I'm reaching
`convert_v1_PodSpec_To_api_PodSpec` and `convert_api_PodSpec_To_v1_PodSpec`
functions which are hand written in pkg/api/v1/conversion.go which results in
compilation errors. What should be the right path to proceed with this? For
now I've copied those functions manually to `pkg/expapi/v1/conversion.go` in
aforementioned PR but I'm quite it's not the expected way to proceed with
that.
