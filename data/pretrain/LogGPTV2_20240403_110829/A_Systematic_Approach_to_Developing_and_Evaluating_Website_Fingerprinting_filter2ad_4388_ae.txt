Increasing n will reduce both the false- and true-positive rates. By
varying n, we can generate the receiver operating curve (ROC) of
C.
In the real world, visits to w∗ may be rare. In this case, false-
positive rate can be a misleading metric. A classiﬁer with a low
false-positive rate may still be useless if true positives are so rare
that they are overwhelmed by false positives. Therefore, we also
report true-discovery rates for the open-world attack and defense
evaluations in this paper. Given an open-world classiﬁer, C, its
true-discovery rate is deﬁned as
TDR(C) = Pr[W = w
∗|C(T D
W ) = 1].
Intuitively, the true-discovery rate is the fraction of alarms that are
true alarms. The true-discovery rate can be computed from the
false-positive and true-positive rates as follows:
Pr[W = w∗] TPR(C)
TDR(C) =
Pr[W = w∗] TPR(C) + Pr[W (cid:54)= w∗] FPR(C)

6. TAMARAW: A NEW DEFENSE
In this section we present a prototype of a new defense, Tama-
raw2, that can be considered a theoretically provable version of Bu-
FLO.
6.1 Design
Based on the results of our comparative and theoretical study of
website ﬁngerprinting defenses, Tamaraw is designed with three
guiding principles in mind:
1. Strong Theoretical Foundations: The security of the Tama-
raw defense is based on an extension of the concept of op-
timal partitioning and feature hiding demonstrated in Sec-
tion 5.1 (against AS attackers). The relation is seen in section
Section 6.2.1.
2A Tamaraw is a lightweight cousin of the Buffalo.
2. Feature coverage: While Section 5.1 aims to hide only the
total transmission size, Tamaraw attempts to hide all fea-
tures. In fact, Table 3 shows that Tamaraw effectively hides
all the features studied in Section 3, with the exception of to-
tal downstream transmission size. As in Section 5.1, optimal
partitioning requires different sites to be padded to different
transmission sizes.
3. Reducing Overhead Costs: BuFLO faces the dilemma that
increasing τ will increase its defensive coverage, but also in-
crease its overhead. We address this dilemma and we are able
to ﬁnd ways to signiﬁcantly reduce the overhead of BuFLO
in both bandwidth and time.
Tamaraw works as follows. As in BuFLO, trafﬁc is still sent in
ﬁxed size packets and at ﬁxed intervals; however, the packet size
is set at 750 bytes rather than the MTU. This is done since most
outgoing packets are covered by this size (see Appendix: Figure
3) while not incurring unwanted overhead. Further, incoming and
outgoing trafﬁc are treated differently. Outgoing trafﬁc is ﬁxed at a
higher packet interval, which saves overhead as outgoing trafﬁc is
much less frequent. We denote the packet intervals as ρout and ρin
(measured in s/packet). We use experimentation to choose these
values of ρ in Section 6.2.
Additionally, BuFLO only attempts to cover total transmission
size if the total amount of time for one page is less than τ. This
makes the choice of τ especially awkward: increasing τ increases
the number of web pages covered by BuFLO, but it also increases
the overhead. In Tamaraw, however, the number of packets sent in
both directions are always padded to multiples of a padding param-
eter, L.3 This means that if L is large enough, then it is likely that
for each web page there exists some other web page that is mapped
to the same multiple of L. Suppose the total number of incoming
packets is I, where AL < I ≤ (A + 1)L, then we pad to (A + 1)L
at the rate ρin. We do this separately for outgoing packets as well.
Compared to the optimal defense in Section 5.1, the partitions pro-
duced are ﬁxed, independent of the dataset.
Even though the differences between BuFLO and Tamaraw are
not very large, the impact on security is tremendous: Tamaraw of-
fers a maximum attack-accuracy guarantee, BuFLO does not.
6.2 Experimental Results
In BuFLO, ρout and ρin were both 0.02, but it is expected that
ρout should not have to be as large as ρin. As the distinguishability
of two different web pages is controlled by the padding parame-
ter L, our objective in the choice of ρin and ρout is to minimize
overhead. We test the bandwidth and time overhead of Tamaraw
on Alexa’s top 100 pages, loaded 70 times each. We vary ρout and
ρin from 0.005 to 0.16 seconds/packet while using Tamaraw with
MTU packet sizes. We present a pareto curve showing all values
for which no other choice of parameters had both a lower time and
bandwidth overhead in the Appendix: Figure 4.
Generally, as ρin and ρout increased, size overhead decreased
while time overhead increased. Here we set L to 100, for reasons
discussed below. With MTU packets, ρout = 0.04 and ρin =
0.012, we achieve a 17% decrease of total transmission size over-
head from BuFLO’s 149 ± 6% to 123 ± 10%, with the time over-
head roughly the same, changing from 330 ± 80% to 320 ± 70%.
3It is non-trivial for the proxy to know when to pad, as it does not
know when the data stream has ended. One way for the proxy to
know this is to set a parameter K, such that if the last K packets
were dummy packets, then the trafﬁc is determined to have ended.
In our analysis we assume that the client and proxy know when to
pad.
In order to achieve these same beneﬁts when we use Tamaraw with
750 byte packet sizes, we maintain the same transmission rate. This
is achieved by halving ρin and ρout – i.e., we set ρout = 0.02 and
ρin = 0.006.
In our implementations of BuFLO and Tamaraw, we pessimisti-
cally required that the original logical ordering of the real packets
must be maintained. For example, if the defense allowed an outgo-
ing packet to be sent, but the next real packet to be sent is an incom-
ing packet, then a dummy outgoing packet is sent, even if there are
other outgoing packets waiting after the incoming packet. This is
to guarantee that the causal order is preserved: it could be that the
subsequent outgoing packets depend on the incoming packet. This
rule has a large effect on the bandwidth. A practical implementa-
tion could achieve a lower size and time overhead as re-ordering is
possible for both defenses when subsequence is not consequence;
our simulations are therefore pessimistic on the overhead but nec-
essary to guarantee correctness.
We apply the same defense methodology in Section 4.2, and
give the results in Table 3, presented earlier. We can see that at
ρout = 0.02, ρin = 0.006, and L = 100, Tamaraw is much more
successful at protecting all features than other defenses, despite that
it cannot achieve a perfect cover of total packet length or frequency
either. Looking more closely at the table, we see that Tamaraw is
not perfectly successful against generators that signiﬁcantly change
the total transmission size (including the unique packet length gen-
erators G1 and G2). As BuFLO sends more dummy outgoing pack-
ets than Tamaraw, BuFLO is more able to cover changes in outgo-
ing transmission size (G2, G5), but it is less able to cover changes
in incoming transmission size (G1, G4, G6). We next show why
Tamaraw is a more effective defense than BuFLO.
6.2.1 An Ideal Attacker
In order to produce an upper bound on the attack accuracy of
any classiﬁer on Tamaraw, we evaluate the partitions produced by
Tamaraw (partitions were introduced in Section 5.1). The number
of partitions is directly linked to the maximum classiﬁcation accu-
racy. For a partition of size |S|, the attacker can at best achieve an
accuracy of 1/|S| on each site in the partition.
For Tamaraw, the partition is calculated as follows. Let D be
Tamaraw where L is set to 0 (no dummy packets appended to the
end). Suppose the number of incoming packets for defended packet
sequence D(P ) is |D(P )inc| and the number of outgoing packets
is |D(P )out|. Two packet sequences D(P ) and D(P (cid:48)) are the
same under Tamaraw if they satisfy:
(cid:106) |D(P (cid:48))inc|
(cid:107)
(cid:106) |D(P )out|
(cid:107)
(cid:106) |D(P (cid:48))out|
(cid:107)
(cid:106) |D(P )inc|
(cid:107)

This is the case even if the attacker is able to observe those packet
sequences multiple times with the knowledge that they belong to
two pages. We experiment on Alexa’s top 800 sites. We only load
one instance of each web page and reset the browser state between
each page load. By doing this, we eliminate the network variability
and make the defense system deterministic, which, as shown in the
Appendix, does not reduce the security of the defense. Thus we
can soundly use this technique to obtain an upper bound on the
success rate of an ideal attacker against this defense. For BuFLO,
we consider two packet sequences to belong to the same partition
if the total transmission size is the same, as total transmission size
is the only observable difference.
6.2.2 Closed-world Performance
Figure 1 shows the non-uniform security provided by Tamaraw
and BuFLO against their corresponding bandwidth overheads. The
BuFLO points correspond to the BuFLO conﬁgurations evaluated
by Dyer, et al. [5]. For reference, Figure 1 also includes a point
TDR of the corresponding open-world classiﬁer where the the web-
site of interest is wi, for i = 1, . . . , 100. Note that, even though
the open-world is the entire internet, our experiment only consid-
ers open-world attacks that attempt to recognize visits to one of
the 100 most popular websites. The reason is because the TDR of
an open-world attack on an unpopular website will be lower than
that of an attack on a more popular website. By showing that the
TDR becomes extremely low when attacking Tamaraw, even for the
ﬁrst 100 websites, we show that it’s extremely low for all websites.
The popularity of each website was taken from the Alexa estimated
page views per million database [1]. We only need popularity in-
formation for the sites used to construct the closed-world classiﬁer;
the rest of the sites on the internet are treated as being randomly
classiﬁed and have, in aggregate, 106− (p1 + p2 + ... + p800) page-
views per million, where pi is the page-views-per-million of the ith
most popular site. For comparison, for the 100th most popular site,
in the open world, Tamaraw (with 200% overhead) has a TDR ap-
th the TDR of BuFLO and Tamaraw (with overhead
proximately 1
13
th the TDR of BuFLO. These
687%) has a TDR approximately 1
110
results show that Tamaraw is a signiﬁcant improvement over Bu-
FLO in the open- and closed-world settings.
7. CODE AND DATA RELEASE
To ensure reproducibility and correctness, all code and data used
in this paper are publicly available4. This includes: traces of web-
sites loaded, code for all generators, code for all feature based at-
tackers, and code for all defenses tested (including Tamaraw).
8. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we developed and tested a new feature-based com-
parative methodology that classiﬁes and qualiﬁes WF defenses.
This methodology allows us to understand which defenses are able
to successfully hide which features – thereby upper-bounding their
success rates in defending against attackers that rely heavily on that
feature. This methodology also exposes some ﬂaws of previous de-
fenses.
Our theoretical model clariﬁes the limits of website ﬁngerprint-
ing defenses. It establishes efﬁciency bounds that no defense can
cross, giving an absolute benchmark for evaluating the efﬁciency
of defenses. The lower bounds of bandwidth costs are surprisingly
low, suggesting that it may be possible to build very efﬁcient de-
fenses. We also show that, in some contexts, randomized defenses
offer no security or overhead advantage compared to deterministic
defenses. This theoretical foundation also provides a framework
for comparing schemes which offer different overhead and security
trade-offs. Further, it allows conclusions to be drawn about open-
world performance of attacks and defenses, based on their closed-
world results. This greatly simpliﬁes the experimental setup re-
quired to estimate open-world performance of attacks and defenses.
While previous work has shown that current WF defenses are
either ineffective or inefﬁcient, and while our work has explained
these results using a systematic methodology, we argue that the
situation is not hopeless for web browsing clients who desire pri-
vacy. We propose a new defense, Tamaraw, that is able to reduce
the overhead of BuFLO signiﬁcantly. Using our methodology, we
show that Tamaraw provides better protection against website ﬁn-
gerprinting attacks than all previous defenses, in both, the open and
closed-world models.

reported by Cai, et al. against their Ca-DLevenshtein attack [3].
The results show that Tamaraw offers a signiﬁcantly better secu-
rity/efﬁciency trade-off than BuFLO. For reference, at a size over-
head of 130%, there are 553 partitions (non-uniform security of
69%) in BuFLO (τ = 9) and 18 partitions (non-uniform security
of 2.25%) in Tamaraw. This shows that a design that adheres to the
principles of provable lower bounds in Section 5.1 is more suitable
for clients.
Table 1 shows how close different defenses are to the optimal
lower bound curve derived in Section 5.1. The Overhead Ratio of
a defense is the ratio between the defense’s bandwidth overhead
and the lower bound on overhead. Table 1 shows the best over-
head ratios that Tamaraw and BuFLO achieved in our experiments.
