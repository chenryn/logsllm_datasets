of the polynomial evaluation. Similar mechanism is used in
mobile secret sharing [61] to change the parties.
Existing schemes mainly apply the VPD scheme in [50],
which requires a trusted setup phase to generate the struc-
tured reference string. In addition, the computation time to
generate the proofs are high because of the use of modular
exponentiation. For example, in a recent paper, Maram et
al. [56] proposed a mobile and proactive secret sharing scheme
on blockchain. As it is using the pairing-based VPD, the
SRS has to be generated by a trusted party, posted on the
blockchain while the trapdoor must be destroyed after the
setup. Moreover, as shown in [56, Figure 5], it takes 185s for
each party to generate the proofs of the polynomial evaluations
in each phase of the scheme for a committee of 1000 parties,
which is the bottleneck of the system.
Using our new VPD scheme in Protocol 2, we can com-
pletely remove the trusted setup phase of these secret sharing
schemes for the ﬁrst time, while maintaining the succinct proof
size and veriﬁcation time. Additionally, the proof generation
time is signiﬁcantly improved. Based on Figure 1, it will take
around 11s to generate the proofs for 1000 parties. The proof
size will deﬁnitely increase. However, as the proofs are sent
ofﬂine among the parties in [56], the overall throughput will
be improved by at least an order of magnitude with reasonable
bandwidth between parties.
B. Privacy on Blockchain
Zero knowledge proof is widely used in blockchain systems
to provide privacy for cryptocurrencies (e.g., Zcash [11]),
smart contracts (e.g., Hawk [52]) and zero knowledge con-
tingent payment [29]. As mentioned in the introduction, the
most commonly deployed ZKP scheme, SNARK [16], requires
a trusted setup phase. A trusted party is usually absent in
the setting of blockchains and an expensive “ceremony” [13]
among multiple parties is usually deployed to generate the
SRS. To address this issue, there are recent attempts to use
transparent ZKP schemes. For example, in [25], B¨unz et at.
proposed Zether, which uses a variant of Bulletproofs [28] to
hide account balances and provide conﬁdentiality for applica-
tions such as auction. However, due to the high prover time
and veriﬁcation time of Bulletproofs for general computations,
providing full anonimity still remain impractical.
As shown in Section V-C, among all
transparent ZKP
schemes, Virgo achieves the best prover time and one of the
best veriﬁcation time, which are critical for applications of
ZKP on blockchains. Compared to existing GKR-based ZKP
scheme, Virgo removes the trusted setup of Libra [70], and
improves the veriﬁcation time of both Libra and Hyrax [69]
by 1-2 orders of magnitude. These make Virgo a good can-
didate to build privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies and smart
contract without trusted setup. The overhead on the proof size
is comparable to schemes based on IOPs, which is acceptable
in scenarios such as permissioned blockchain and can be
potentially reduced through proof composition [17].
C. Large Scale Zero Knowledge Proof
Other than blockchain, there are many other applications
of ZKP that require proving large statements. For example,
defense advanced research project agency (DARPA) recently
intended to use ZKP to prove the behavior of complicated
programs without
leaking sensitive information [1]. Such
applications require scaling ZKP schemes to circuits with
billions of gates. The obstacles in all existing ZKP schemes are
the high overhead of running time and memory consumption
on the prover. In our new scheme, we completely removes
the operations of modular exponentiation in Hyrax [69] and
Libra [70], which is the bottleneck of both the prover time and
memory usage. Our implementation, Virgo, is purely based
on symmetric-key operations, which are fast and memory
friendly. As shown in the experiments, Virgo is promising to
scale to large circuits and enable applications such as proving
program behavior on secret data or states.
