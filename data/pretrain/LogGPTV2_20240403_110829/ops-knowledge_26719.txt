Question: "Consider the following code snippet from a network service program written in C:

    void network_service() {
        unsigned int size;
        char *buffer;

        size = receive_size_from_client();
        if (size > 1024) {
            reject_request();
            return;
        }
        buffer = (char *)malloc(size + 1);
        receive_data_from_client(buffer, size);
        buffer[size] = '\0';
        // ... process the buffer ...
    }

Which of the following statements are true regarding potential vulnerabilities in this code?"
 "A": "The conditional check ensures that the size variable cannot cause a buffer overflow when writing to the buffer."
 "B": "An integer overflow could occur if the size provided by the client is close to the maximum value representable by an unsigned int, leading to a smaller than expected allocation."
 "C": "The use of malloc to allocate memory for the buffer is safe as it adds 1 to the size, ensuring there is space for the null terminator."
 "D": "The code is secure against memory safety vulnerabilities because it checks the size of the input before processing."
