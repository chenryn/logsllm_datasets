rewiring has increased much faster than that due to AS birth. Cur-
rently, around 75% of link births are associated with existing ASes
(rewiring). A similar analysis, shown in the bottom panel, shows
that the number of CP link deaths due to rewiring is signiﬁcantly
higher than that due to AS deaths. About 80% of the link deaths are
due to rewiring and this fraction is increasing. These observations
are important for two reasons. First, most of the literature on AS
topology modeling has focused on growth, ignoring rewiring. Sec-
ond, rewiring represents the effort of individual ASes to optimize
their performance, reliability, proﬁtability or other objectives. An
intriguing possibility is that rewiring implies that the Internet, as a
multi-agent and self-organized system, attempts to optimize a cer-
tain, still unknown, global objective in a distributed manner. This
possibility has also been discussed by Chang et al. [6].
Given the increasing signiﬁcance of rewiring, we next focus on
the births and deaths of links between existing nodes in two suc-
cessive snapshots. Let G1 and G2 be the graphs representing the
primary AS topology in two consecutive snapshots. We construct
G(cid:3)
1 from G1 by removing all nodes that are not present in G2; sim-
ilarly construct G(cid:3)
2 have the same
set of nodes. Let E(cid:3)
2 be the set of links in G(cid:3)
2 re-
spectively. We use the following graph-level metric, referred to as
Jaccard Distance, to quantify the rewiring between G(cid:3)

Note that s(E(cid:3)
2) captures both link births and deaths between
two snapshots. The Jaccard distance thus quantiﬁes the difference
between the sets of links in two consecutive snapshots. For exam-
ple, a Jaccard distance of 0.5 indicates that 50% of the links seen in
the two snapshots were either born before the second snapshot or
died after the ﬁrst.
We calculate the Jaccard distance separately, ﬁrst, on the CP
graph where the customer is a stub, and second, on the CP graph
where the customer is a non-stub. Figure 6 shows these metrics for
each pair of snapshots over the last 10 years. We ﬁnd that the Jac-
card distance is much smaller for the CP graph where the customer
is a stub, as compared to the CP graph where the customer is a non-
stub. This indicates that non-stubs have consistently been more
aggressive than stubs in changing their upstream connectivity. We
further investigate this effect after proposing a ﬁner classiﬁcation
of AS types in the Internet in the next section.
4. EVOLUTION OF AS TYPES
When we think of the Internet as a graph, it is important to rec-
ognize that not all nodes are the same. ASes connect to the Inter-
net with different requirements and business interests, and hence
optimize their connectivity in different ways [13]. The topology
changes that we observe represent the outcome of a complex multi-
constraint optimization process that individual ASes conduct.
AS classiﬁcation scheme: We propose a simple classiﬁcation scheme
for ASes according to their business type. The initial classiﬁcation
consists of the following ﬁve AS types.
Enterprise Customers (EC) represent various organizations, uni-
versities and companies at the network edge that are mostly users,
rather than providers of Internet access, transit or content. Typi-
cally, ECs do not have AS customers.
Small Transit Providers (STP) are often regional ISPs that pro-
vide Internet access and transit services. STPs aim to maximize
their customer base in their geographical area and to reduce their
upstream transit costs through selective peering with other regional
ISPs. STPs often peer selectively rather than openly to avoid peer-
ing with ASes already in their customer tree, or ASes that are likely
to become customers at a future time. We count national and aca-
demic/research transit networks also as STPs.
Large Transit Providers (LTP) are international ISPs with a
large footprint, both in terms of number of AS customers and ge-
ographical presence. LTPs aim to maximize their customer base,
peering with other ASes only when it is necessary to maintain
reachability (restrictive peering).
Access/Hosting Providers (AHP) are ISPs that offer Internet
access (e.g., DSL, cable modem, dial-up, leased lines) and/or server
hosting. Their access customers can be residential users or en-
terprises that do not have AS numbers, while their server hosting
customers are content/service providers that also do not have AS
numbers6. AHPs often engage in selective peering to minimize the
transit costs paid to their upstream providers.
Content Providers (CP) are not in the business of offering Inter-
net transit or access. Instead, their revenues result from providing
content that users pay for. CPs aim to minimize transit costs, and
so often have open peering policies.
Similar classiﬁcations have been proposed in previous work. Chang
et al. [5] classiﬁed ASes (for the purposes of determining interdo-

main trafﬁc matrices) into “web hosting”, “residential access” and
“business access”. Dimitropoulos et al. [12] classiﬁed ASes into
large and small ISPs, customer networks, universities, Internet ex-
change points and network information centers. We chose the pre-
vious ﬁve AS types based on the terminology used in discussions
on the NANOG mailing list and in W. Norton’s white papers [25].
Note that the difference between LTPs and STPs is quantitative,
as both AS types have the same business function. LTPs are ba-
sically the major ISPs that are often referred to, rather informally,
as “‘tier-1” transit providers. The “tier-1” label is often associated
with 10-20 ASes. We choose to be more inclusive, deﬁning as LTPs
the top-30 ASes in terms of the average number of customers dur-
ing the time period in which an AS was seen in the last decade.
That average is larger than 140 AS customers for the LTPs in our
datasets.
This leaves us with around 27,000 ASes (in the latest snapshot)
that cannot be classiﬁed manually. Instead, we ﬁrst pick a training
set of 50 ASes for each of the remaining four AS types (EC, STP,
AHP and CP) that are deﬁnitely of the corresponding type (based
on information obtained from their webpages). For ECs, we pick
well-known universities and corporations. For STPs, we choose
transit providers that are mostly regional in terms of their coverage
and customer size. For CPs and AHPs, we pick well-known con-
tent providers, hosting sites, and large broadband/dial-up residen-
tial/business access ISPs. Next, we observe the topological proper-
ties of the ASes in each training set, in terms of the average number
of customers C, providers P , and peers R for that AS in the last
decade. We found signiﬁcant overlap in the number of providers
among the four AS types, and so we do not rely on that metric. On
the other hand, the number of customers and peers (C, R) allows
us to distinguish between ECs, STPs and CPs. Unfortunately, we
are unable to distinguish CPs from AHPs. These two AS types,
even though have different business roles, largely overlap in terms
of both C and R. So, in the rest of the paper we merge these two
AS types in what will be referred to as Content/Access/Hosting
Providers (CAHPs). Figure 7 shows the average number of cus-
tomers and peers for ASes in the four training sets. Most ECs have
zero customers and peers, and they are not shown in this graph.
The next step is to determine a set of boundaries in the two-
dimensional (C, R) space that separate the training sets of the four
AS types with the minimum number of misclassiﬁcations. We ap-
ply the well known machine learning technique of decision trees
on the training samples to obtain the following C and R coordinate
boundaries for each AS type:
EC: C  1 and 2.1 ≤ C < 33.1, R ≥ 3.5
LTP: C ≥ 140
Based on the previous boundaries, we next use the average C and
R values of each AS (measured over the snapshots in which that
AS was present in the ten-year dataset) to classify it into one of the
four AS types. Note that the AS types we consider are quite dis-
tinct from each other in terms of their function and business goals.
It is thus reasonable to expect that ASes do not change from one
AS type to another during their lifetime. To examine this hypoth-
esis, we performed the following test. We rerun the decision tree
algorithm to classify each AS using a two-year dataset from 2006
and 2007. We then compared this more recent classiﬁcation with
that based on the ten-year dataset. We found that only 3% of the
ASes that appear in both datasets were classiﬁed differently.
In
most of these cases, it appears that the classiﬁcation change was
due to a large shift in the customer and peer degrees of that AS. For

example, AS-1 has a large average customer degree over the ten-
year dataset and is classiﬁed as an LTP. However, in the two-year
dataset it has a customer degree of 0, and is classiﬁed as an EC.
AS1 was originally owned by Genuity Inc., a large global ISP. In
2004, Genuity sold AS-1 to Level3 Communications, also a global
ISP. Level3 does not use that AS number for its transit services, and
this is why that AS has no customers in the last couple of years.
To evaluate the accuracy of the previous classiﬁcation scheme,
we perform the following. We select a random sample of 150 ASes
(50 ECs, 50 STPs and 50 CAHPs), and mix these samples to re-
move any information about the classiﬁcation of these ASes (to
avoid any subjective bias in the validation process). Then, we use
information from WHOIS servers and the webpages of those ASes
to infer their main business function. If the actual business func-
tion does not match the classiﬁcation produced by our algorithm,
we count that AS as a misclassiﬁcation. We ﬁnd that the classi-
ﬁcation accuracy for ECs is 78%. The errors in this category are
due to some residential access providers that are classiﬁed as ECs
because they have no AS customers and no peers. The accuracy
for STPs is 86%. The errors here are due to ASes that mainly offer
content hosting services. These providers have few AS customers
and a small number (or none) of peers and hence they get classiﬁed
as STPs. The classiﬁcation accuracy for CAHPs is 86%. The errors
in this case are mostly due to some academic/research backbones
that get classiﬁed as CAHPs due to their large number of peers.
Dimitropoulos et al. [12] reported a similar accuracy ﬁgure (78%)
for their AS classiﬁcation scheme.
Population trends for each AS type: Figure 8 shows the popu-
lation of each AS type over the last ten years. These curves show
two distinct phases, similar to the global growth trends observed in
Section 3, with a change of slope around 2001. The STP popula-
tion shows a small growth rate (increase by factor of 1.23 over the
last six years). The LTP population remains almost 30 by deﬁni-
tion. The EC population shows a strong growth trend (increase by
factor of 2.33 in the last six years), contributing most of the growth
in the number of ASes. The CAHP population, even though much
smaller in absolute numbers than ECs, has also been growing sig-
niﬁcantly (increase by factor of 1.6 in the last six years). ECs and
CAHPs represent the periphery of the network, where the users
and content reside. If we judge by the population of this AS type,
the Internet edge grows at a signiﬁcant and stable pace. On the
other hand, LTPs and STPs represent the core of the Internet. Even
though the STP population was growing signiﬁcantly before 2001,
their growth rate in the last few years has decreased. This may be
an indication that the number of transit providers is stabilizing.
