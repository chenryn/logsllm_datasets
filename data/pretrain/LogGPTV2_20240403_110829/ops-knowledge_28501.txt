It seems you are facing difficulties in setting up Python 2.7 as the default version on your CentOS 5 system and subsequently installing Django. Here’s a more structured approach to address your concerns:

### 1. Setting Python 2.7 as the Default Version

Since your CentOS 5 system relies on Python 2.4, it is not advisable to change the system-wide default Python version. Instead, you can set up Python 2.7 for your specific user or project. Here’s how you can do it:

#### Install Python 2.7
1. **Download and install Python 2.7:**
   ```sh
   wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.18/Python-2.7.18.tgz
   tar -xzf Python-2.7.18.tgz
   cd Python-2.7.18
   ./configure --prefix=/opt/python2.7
   make
   sudo make altinstall
   ```

2. **Verify the installation:**
   ```sh
   /opt/python2.7/bin/python2.7 -V
   ```

#### Set Up an Alias
1. **Create an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:**
   ```sh
   echo 'alias python=/opt/python2.7/bin/python2.7' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. **Verify the alias:**
   ```sh
   python -V
   ```

### 2. Installing Django

Once you have Python 2.7 set up, you can proceed with installing Django. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your project dependencies.

#### Create a Virtual Environment
1. **Install `virtualenv` if it is not already installed:**
   ```sh
   /opt/python2.7/bin/pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a new virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   /opt/python2.7/bin/virtualenv -p /opt/python2.7/bin/python2.7 myprojectenv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   source myprojectenv/bin/activate
   ```

#### Install Django
1. **Install Django using `pip`:**
   ```sh
   pip install django
   ```

2. **Verify the installation:**
   ```sh
   python -m django --version
   ```

### Summary
- **Installed Python 2.7** in `/opt/python2.7`.
- **Set up an alias** to use Python 2.7 by default for your user.
- **Created a virtual environment** to manage your project dependencies.
- **Installed Django** within the virtual environment.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up Python 2.7 and install Django successfully on your CentOS 5 system. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for further assistance.
