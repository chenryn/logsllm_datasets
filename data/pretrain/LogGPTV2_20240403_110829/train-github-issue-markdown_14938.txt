### Bug report
**Bug summary**  
Got 'Could not convert glyph to bitmap' error when run matplotlib
fig.savefig() in parallel
Recently we got this 'Could not convert glyph to bitmap' error from time to
time after we implemented a multi-process solution of the pipeline. That is,
there could be multiple processes plotting and saving the figures
simultaneously. We had removed all individual fig.savefig() invoking at the
top level and forced to use util function in every place. Now the error tracks
back to that last fig.savefig() within util function which was pretty bad. It
seemed that the more complicated the figure, the more processes running at the
same time, the higher possibility we got this issue.
**Code for reproduction**
    # Paste your code here
    # We used the following line to save a figure in utli.save_figures()
    fig.savefig(full_path, pad_inches=pad_inches, dpi=dpi)
**Actual outcome**
    # If applicable, paste the console output here
