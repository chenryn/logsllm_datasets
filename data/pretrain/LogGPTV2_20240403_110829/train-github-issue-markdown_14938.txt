### Bug Report

**Bug Summary**  
We are encountering the "Could not convert glyph to bitmap" error when using `matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig()` in a multi-process environment. This issue has become more frequent after implementing a multi-process solution for our pipeline, where multiple processes may be plotting and saving figures simultaneously. The error seems to occur more often with complex figures and when more processes are running concurrently.

**Code for Reproduction**  
```python
# The following line is used to save a figure in util.save_figures()
fig.savefig(full_path, pad_inches=pad_inches, dpi=dpi)
```

**Actual Outcome**  
The error traceback is as follows:
```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "analysis/util.py", line 1041, in save_figures
    fig.savefig(full_path, pad_inches=pad_inches, dpi=dpi)

    font.draw_glyphs_to_bitmap(antialiased=rcParams['text.antialiased'])
RuntimeError: In draw_glyphs_to_bitmap: Could not convert glyph to bitmap
```

**Expected Outcome**  
All figures should be saved successfully without any errors.

**Environment Details**  
- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04.4
- Matplotlib Version: 2.2.4
- Matplotlib Backend: `agg`
- Python Version: 2.7.12
