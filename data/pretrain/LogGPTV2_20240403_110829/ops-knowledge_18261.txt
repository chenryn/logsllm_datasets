User: In Google Appengine, I'm interested in pickling an object and storing it in the datastore. I don't need to index it.
Is there any difference if I store it as a BlobProperty or TextProperty? Which one is better?
Assistant: BlobProperty can store binary data while TextProperty can store only strings.
You can use BlobProperty as TextProperty is basicly a BlobProperty with encoding.
