# Geolocation Attacks and Detectability

## 5.3.1 Directional Accuracy of Attacks

We first confirm that the adversary can move the target to a similar location, regardless of the original location. Figure 16 illustrates the difference between the direction the adversary intended to move the target and the actual direction (θ in the delay-adding attack). For the general topology-based attack, the adversary is within 36 degrees of the intended direction 75% of the time and within 69 degrees 90% of the time. The undns extension improves this, with the adversary being within 3 degrees of the intended direction 95% of the time. When moving from Europe to North America, the target always moves very close to the chosen direction, with the adversary always within 10 degrees. The smaller change in direction for European nodes is due to the longer distance between the target and the forged location, leading to smaller observed directional changes for similar error values.

### 5.3.2 Attack Detectability
We have observed that an adversary executing the topology-based attack and the undns extension can accurately relocate the geolocation target. Next, we consider whether the victim can detect these attacks and mitigate their impact on geolocation results.

Figure 17 shows the region sizes for topology-aware geolocation and undns geolocation before and after the attacks are executed (for both North American and European targets). Unlike the delay-adding attack, the adversary who adds hops to the traceroutes of the victim has region sizes similar to or even smaller than the original algorithms. For topology-aware geolocation, the median region size decreases from 102,273 km² to 50,441 km². For the undns extension, it decreases from 4,448 km² to 790 km². These results indicate that region size is not a reliable metric for detecting attacks that add hops to traceroute paths.

Another potential metric for detecting modified geolocation results is path circuitousness. We define the circuitousness of a traceroute path between a landmark \( L_i \) and the target as follows, where \( r = (\lambda_r, \phi_r) \) is the location returned by the geolocation algorithm, and \( h_j = (\lambda_j, \phi_j) \) is the location of intermediate hop \( j \):

\[
C = \frac{d_{i h_0} + \sum_{j=1}^{n} d_{h_{j-1} h_j} + d_{h_n r}}{d_{ir}}
\]

Figure 18 shows the distribution of circuitousness for paths between each landmark and the target for topology-aware geolocation before and after the topology-based attack. We observe that the circuitousness per landmark increases when the topology-based attack is executed. A geolocation algorithm could discard results from landmarks with abnormally high circuitousness. If a geolocation framework, such as Octant, assigns weights to constraints, constraints from landmarks with high circuitousness could be given lower weights to limit the adversary's effectiveness. However, a clever adversary could design her network to use more direct paths, making detection by observing circuitousness more difficult.

## 6 Related Work
While there have been numerous studies on developing and evaluating geolocation algorithms (e.g., [12, 14, 26, 30]), limited research has focused on IP geolocation for non-benign targets [5, 18].

### Castelluccia et al.
Castelluccia et al. [5] apply Constraint-Based Geolocation (CBG) [12] to locate hidden servers hosting illegal content within a botnet. These servers use "fast-flux" techniques, where a constantly changing set of infected machines proxy HTTP messages for the hidden server. Geolocating these servers is crucial for authorities to take action. They factor out the portion of the observed Round-Trip Time (RTT) caused by the proxy layer, using HTTP connections to measure RTTs and achieving a median error of 100 km using PlanetLab nodes as ground truth.

### Muir and Oorschot
Muir and Oorschot [18] survey various geolocation techniques and their applicability in the presence of adversarial targets. Their work emphasizes leveraging secondary sources of information, such as whois registries, DNS LOC [8], HTTP headers, and routing information. They discuss the limitations of IP geolocation when an adversary uses anonymization proxies and demonstrate how a Web page embedding a Java applet can discover a client's true identity using Java's socket class to connect back to the server, particularly in the context of the Tor [28] anonymization network.

### Previous Works
Previous works begin to address the performance of geolocation algorithms when the target may be adversarial. However, they generally focus on hosts that use proxies to deceive geolocation. In contrast, our work develops and evaluates attacks on two classes of measurement-based geolocation techniques by manipulating the network properties they rely on.

The problem of geolocating an adversarial target is similar to secure positioning in wireless networks [4]. Unlike wireless signals, network delay is subject to additive noise due to congestion, queuing, and circuitous routes. Multiple hops along Internet paths and large organizational WANs enable new adversarial models in IP geolocation.

## 7 Conclusions
Many applications of geolocation, such as limiting media distribution, fraud detection, and ensuring regional regulatory compliance, benefit from security guarantees against adversarial targets. This paper considers two models of adversaries trying to mislead measurement-based geolocation techniques that leverage end-to-end delays and topology information. We developed and evaluated two attacks against delay-based and topology-aware geolocation.

Adversaries can exploit inherent variability in network delay and circuitousness to hide their tampering. Our most surprising finding is that more advanced and accurate topology-aware geolocation techniques are more susceptible to covert tampering than simpler delay-based techniques. For delay-based geolocation, a simple adversary adding delay to probes can alter geolocation results but has limited precision. There is a clear trade-off between the amount of delay added and detectability, using the region size returned by CBG [12] as a metric for discarding anomalous results.

Topology-aware geolocation, which uses more information sources like traceroute and undns, fares no better against a simple adversary and worse against a sophisticated one. A sophisticated adversary can cause the geolocation system to return accurate results without increasing the resultant region size. When undns entries are corrupted, the adversary can forge locations with high accuracy, sometimes even decreasing the region sizes.

Our work reveals the limitations of current measurement-based geolocation techniques in the presence of adversarial targets. To provide secure geolocation, these algorithms must account for untrustworthy measurements, possibly through heuristics or secure measurement protocols. Future work will explore these directions.

**Notes:**
1. In reality, the consumer of geolocation information will likely contract out geolocation services from a third party geolocation provider that will maintain landmarks. Given the common goals of these two entities, we model them as a single party.
2. The adversary can assume that the gateway routers are geolocated to their true locations.
3. We make similar observations for the undns attack extension.
