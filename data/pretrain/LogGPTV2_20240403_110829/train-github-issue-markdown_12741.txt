### Issue Details
  * **Electron Version:**
    * Downloaded 9.0.2 and 9.0.3 electron.exe --version does not provide anything
  * **Operating System:**
    * Windows 10 Insider preview (build 19631.1)
  * **Last Known Working Electron version:**
    * 8.3.5
### Expected Behavior
Double-click on electron in file explorer should open a window.
### Actual Behavior
Nothing happens. Starting from a terminal does not open a UI and does not show
any trace even using
    PS C:\Users\olivi\Downloads\electron903> .\electron.exe --version
    PS C:\Users\olivi\Downloads\electron903> .\electron.exe --enable-logging -v=10
    PS C:\Users\olivi\Downloads\electron903>
### To Reproduce
  1. Downloaded electron-v9.0.3-win32-x64.zip from the releases.
  2. Unzip it in a directory
  3. Double click on electron.exe in the file explorer
  4. Or run .\electron.exe in the directory from a windows terminal
  5. Absolutely nothing happens, and you get back to the prompt
### Additional Information
Bug discovered while testing keeweb 1.15.x which runs on electron 9.0.x  
Keeweb 1.14.3 running on electron 8.2.5 works fine  
I downloaded electron 8.3.5 and did the same (unzip in a directory and double
clic) and it works!!!
