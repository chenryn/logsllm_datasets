So imagine I'm building an API from a set of blueprints like
    signupbp = Blueprint('signupbp', __name__, url_prefix="/signup")
    @signupbp.route("/")
    def signup_start():
        return "signup_start"
    @signupbp.route("/complete")
    def signup_complete():
        return "signup_complete"
then in my main.py code I do something like:
    app.register_blueprint(signupbp, url_prefix='/api')
I expect to see the following routes:
    /api/signup/                    signupbp.signup_start   
    /api/signup/complete            signupbp.signup_complete
    /static/         static                  
What I actually see is:
    /api/                    signupbp.signup_start   
    /api/complete            signupbp.signup_complete
    /static/  static                  
I imagine the url_prefixes should be additive not replacement (in the worse
possible way). I've tried all combinations of `/` before and after the
url_prefix params.
This is actually a very simplified example - in my API I'm using module names
to implement versioning so I can't build the URL into any part of the code
before thats suggested as a solution.
