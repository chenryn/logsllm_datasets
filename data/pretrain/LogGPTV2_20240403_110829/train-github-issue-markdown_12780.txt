the new version of scipy i.e. 0.7.1 and 0.7.0 des not include the "signal"
subpackage. I need to inform my operating system is windows and I downloaded
the .exe file for python 2.5. I installed older version 0.6 for using the
signal processing subpackage of scipy. Please add these subpackage to new
version as well.
