  3. Press the newly remapped `Win (Left)` \+ `R`. Game Recording opens instead of the Run dialog.
# Expected behavior
`Win` \+ `R` should open the Run dialog. It works fine if I deactivate the
Keyboard Manager, but doesn't work correctlywith it enabled.
# Actual behavior
`Win` \+ `R` is opening Game Recording instead of the Run dialog.
