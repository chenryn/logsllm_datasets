User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题RDP into Windows 2008 R2 server just stopped responding Have a weird situation. I am running a windows 2008 R2 box that has 128 gigs ram and 2 6 core processorss. Box runs like a champ, however, it seems like every week orweek and a half, I can't RDP into it anymore. The handshake is immediate. Username and password start the configuring remote session but it just hangs and hangs and hangs until RDC times out. No other uses but me. No firewall appliance except for Windows firewall. And the box still serves up pages just fine. Any ideas?

Also should be noted if I type a bad password it lets me know so, its connecting... just not enough to get the desktop... Lastly one more thing... when I went to data center and hooked monitor mouse and keyboard I couldn't log in as neither responded.

Searching Google for that returns a number of links, most of which have troubleshooting and/or resolution suggestions.  That EventID even has its own page on Technet, all official from from Microsoft itself.
