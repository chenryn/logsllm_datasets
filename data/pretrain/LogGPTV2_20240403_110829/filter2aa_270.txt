“End to end encryption is legal. Period.”

“The Net interprets censorship as damage 
and routes around it.” 
John Gilmore, ~1993 
The First Crypto Wars 
The First Crypto Wars 
If all you have is a hammer… 
If all you have is a J.D. … 
And the Internet was a safer place for it! 
Thank your lucky PKIs for ECCN 5D002!! 
•  We thought we had solved the field… 
– But thanks to Comey 
– More work remains 
The Next Crypto Wars 
What could possibly go wrong? 
What if we re-named back doors? 
The slide you are about to see is false. 
Legislation 
•  Many countries around the world are 
considering legislation that would either  
– mandate backdoors,  
– mandate access to plaintext or  
– endanger encryption. 
UK IPB and the Death of e2e 
AUS DSGL and the Death of all crypto…

Thanks Obama 
•  October 2015: 
We “will not —for now—call for legislation 
requiring companies to decode messages for 
law enforcement.” 
Thanks Obama 
•  November 2015: 
Identify laws that need to be changed to deal 
with “going dark.” 
Thanks Obama 
•  March 2016: 
“My conclusion so far is that you cannot take 
an absolutist view on this…it's fetishizing our 
phones above every other value. And that can't 
be the right answer.” 
All Writs Act Litigation 
•  Apple v. FBI 
–  This is the San Bernardino iPhone case 
–  Also, a case in EDNY 
Other Litigation 
•  Wiretap Act litigation may be coming 
–  New York Times report re: WhatsApp 
•  There may be FISA Court orders 
–  EFF is in the middle of a FOIA case to get access 
to them 
Burr-Feinstein Bill 
•  Would require providers to decrypt on 
demand 
–  Criminal and civil penalties 
•  Applies to comms, storage, and licensing 
–  This includes app stores and open source 
•  Not just e2e and FDE 
–  This would outlaw computers as we know them 
2016 
•  What are we looking at? 
–  Key escrow mandate 
•  I don’t think this is actually going to happen. 
– Burr-Feinstein 
•  This definitely won’t happen (in the current form) 
–  We don’t care how, just make plaintext available. 
•  This is the route the UK seems to be taking… 
Defaults, not Primitives 
•  California AB 1681 
•  New York A8093A 
2016 
•  But what is actually likely? 
–  Informal pressure 
–  No ban will reach FOSS crypto 
–  CALEA-like mandate 
–  Countries around the world may do dumb things 
It’s not going to work this time any better 
than it did the last time. 
So what’s to be done? 
•  What if you’re a developer staring down the 
barrel of an order/request/demand/NSL? 
•  What if you’re a regular person? 
•  What if you just have some questions?
