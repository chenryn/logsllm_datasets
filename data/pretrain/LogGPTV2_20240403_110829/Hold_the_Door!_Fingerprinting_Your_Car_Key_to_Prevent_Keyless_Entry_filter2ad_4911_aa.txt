Abstract—Recently,  the  traditional  way  to  unlock  car  doors 
has been replaced with a keyless entry system which proves more 
convenient for automobile owners. When a driver with a key fob 
is in the vicinity of the vehicle, doors automatically unlock on user 
command.  However, unfortunately,  it  has  been  shown  that  these 
keyless  entry  systems  are  vulnerable  to  signal-relaying  attacks. 
While  it  is  evident  that  automobile  manufacturers  incorporate 
preventative  methods  to  secure  these  keyless  entry  systems,  they 
continue  to  be  vulnerable  to  a  range  of  attacks.  Relayed  signals 
result  in  valid  packets  that  are  veriﬁed  as  legitimate,  and  this 
makes it is difﬁcult to distinguish a legitimate door unlock request 
from  a  malicious  signal.  In  response  to  this  vulnerability,  this 
paper  presents  an  RF-ﬁngerprinting  method  (coined  “HOld  the 
DOoR”,  HODOR)  to  detect  attacks  on  keyless  entry  systems  -
the  ﬁrst  attempt  to  exploit  the  RF-ﬁngerprint  technique  in  the 
automotive  domain.  HODOR  is  designed  as  a  sub-authentication 
method that supports existing authentication systems for keyless 
entry systems and does not require any modiﬁcation of the main 
system  to  perform.  Through  a  series  of  experiments,  the  results 
demonstrate that HODOR competently and reliably detects attacks 
on  keyless  entry  systems.  HODOR  achieves  both  an  average  false 
positive  rate  (FPR)  of  0.27%  with  a  false  negative  rate  (FNR) 
of  0%  for  the  detection  of  simulated  attacks,  corresponding  to 
current research on keyless entry car theft. Furthermore, HODOR 
was  also  observed  under  environmental  factors:  temperature 
variation, non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, and battery aging. 
HODOR yields a false positive rate of  1.32% for the identiﬁcation 
of  a  legitimated  key  fob  even  under  NLoS  conditions.  Based  on 
the  experimental  results,  it  is  expected  that  HODOR  will  provide 
a  secure  service  for  keyless  entry  systems,  while  remaining 
convenient.

INTRODUCTION
Recently,  keyless  entry  systems  have  been  developed  and 
installed  in  modern  vehicles  for  the  convenience  of  drivers. 
Before the keyless entry system, it was necessary to physically 
insert a key into the key hole to unlock the doors of a vehicle. 
This traditional way to unlock doors was inconvenient as well 
as  vulnerable  to  physical  key  copying  leading  to  relatively 
easy  automotive  theft  or  break-ins.  The  keyless  entry  system 
enables a driver to unlock doors without inserting anything, via 
two  distinct  systems:  the  remote  keyless  entry  (RKE)  system 
and  the  passive  keyless  entry  and  start  (PKES)  system.  The 
RKE  system  unlocks  doors  with  the  press  of  a  button  on  a

remote key fob at a distance. In the PKES system, car doors
are automatically unlocked as the user makes physical contact
with a button on a door when the key fob is in the vicinity. This
implies that drivers no longer need to remove their key fobs
from their pockets or bags. We note that the PKES system
is mostly designed to include the remote lock and unlock
functions provided by the RKE system. However, as keyless
entry systems are becoming commonplace on modern vehicles,
cyber security attacks are also on the rise. Vehicle manufactur-
ers, therefore, have applied their own security mechanisms to
verify either the remotes or key fobs. In particular, encryption
with a pre-shared, long-term secret key and rolling codes [37],
[64] are common methods used to verify a legitimate key fob.
Despite these security mechanisms, several vulnerabilities
with keyless entry systems have been discovered. In 2010, the
authors of [38] demonstrated a relay attack on PKES systems,
in which vehicle doors were unlocked. In the relay attack,
two colluding adversaries would work in concert to extend
the original range of RF communication between a vehicle
and its key fob. One adversary must be close to the target
vehicle and the other must be close to its key fob. They
cooperate with each other to relay signals from the vehicle
to the key fob side. As a consequence, even outside of the
pre-deﬁned communication range, the vehicle and its key fob
interact with each other, which leads to the unlocking of
the doors. In Germany and the United Kingdom, automotive
thieves successfully carried out these types of signal-relaying
attacks, which were captured on security cameras [10], [19]. In
addition, an adversary could exploit a particular vulnerability
of a cryptographic algorithm used in the remote keyless entry
system to extract a pre-shared secret key between the vehicle
and its key fob, thereby creating and transmitting a malicious
message for a door unlock command [22], [40], [45], [47],
[61]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that long-term
secrets can be compromised not only in the RKE system but
also in the PKES system [66].
The underlying reason of the cyber security attacks on
the keyless entry system is that radio frequency (RF) signals
emitted from key fobs can be relayed or replayed regardless
of active security methods like encryption or authentication.
Since the keyless entry system accepts any request for authen-
tication as long as valid signals are within the communication
range, extension of the communication range by relaying or
forwarding a signal ultimately enables an attacker to unlock car
doors. One approach to resolve this issue might be the use of an
RF distance-bounding protocol that veriﬁes the actual physical
proximity of a request [25], [44]. However, RF distance-
bounding protocols are highly sensitive to timing errors. This is
because the distance-bounding protocol measures the distance
based on the time of ﬂight (ToF) of an RF signal which
propagates at the speed of light. Recently, an ultra-wide band
impulse radio (UWB-IR) ranging technique has emerged as a
prominent technology to deploy a distance-bounding protocol,
and numerous efforts are underway to deploy a secure UWB-
IR ranging technique [4], [52], [57], [58]. However,
this
approach would require the keyless entry system to adopt
an entirely new communication system to implement the RF
distance-bounding protocol.
To detect attacks on keyless entry systems, we employ
an RF ﬁngerprinting technique that extracts ﬁngerprints of
individual RF devices from their RF signals. Due to hardware
imperfections, distinct characteristics per RF device can be
extracted even if they transmit the same binary message. In
other areas, RF ﬁngerprinting methods have already been
proposed to identify RF devices [26], [30], [31], [55], [68],
which are referred to as the ground truth of HODOR. These
existing methods were designed to identify RF devices in
line-of-sight (LoS) and indoor conditions. However, HODOR
is herein proven to function in both non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
and outdoor conditions.
In this paper, we present our evaluations of HODOR in
detecting attacks on keyless entry systems, including RKE
and PKES systems. The method has been designed as a sub-
authentication system that supports an existing authentication
system. As such, it can be directly applied to a keyless entry
system without any modiﬁcation to the current communication
system. Our experimental results show that HODOR precisely
and accurately detects several types of attack attempts. The
detailed contributions of this research are as follows.
•
•
Based on previous attack demonstrations conducted in
existing research, we present a new attack model that
combines all known attack methods; our attack model
covers both PKES and RKE systems. This is the ﬁrst
attempt to formalize existing attacks on keyless entry
systems.
• We present an RF ﬁngerprinting method, HODOR,
to identify legitimate key fobs and detect malicious
attempts deﬁned in our attack model. HODOR can be
easily employed by adding a new device that captures
and analyzes the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band RF
signals emitted from a key fob, which implies that the
current system would require no alterations.
• We performed a series of experiments to evaluate
HODOR. We simulated malicious attacks that are de-
ﬁned in our attack model with different kinds of RF
devices. The experimental results show that HODOR
is able to correctly detect the attacks, which has an
average FPR of 0.27% with an FNR of 0% for the
PKES system.
HODOR was also evaluated under varying environmen-
tal factors, such as temperature variations, NLoS con-
ditions (e.g., a key fob placed in a pocket) and battery
aging. We show that the features we present work
properly under these environmental factors, indicating
that HODOR can be applied in current commonly
existing systems.

II. BACKGROUND
To easily understand HODOR and our attack model, we
describe the background of keyless entry systems and digital
communication.
A. Keyless Entry Systems
When a vehicle is equipped with a PKES system, a driver
can unlock their doors as long as he/she is in the vicinity of
their vehicle. In some cases, a driver must also press a button
on the vehicle. Mutual communication between the key fob
and vehicle is needed to verify whether the driver is actually
nearby. The vehicle then sends a challenge to the key fob via
low frequency (LF) band (125 ∼ 135kHz) communication,
and the corresponding key fob responds to the request via
UHF-band communication. Fig. 1a illustrates an example of
the message ﬂow for veriﬁcation in the PKES system. Vehicles
periodically broadcast LF signals to check if a proper key fob
is in the vicinity, like beacon signals [41]. In the case that
a key fob is within the communication range of an LF band
(e.g., 1 ∼ 2m), it receives a periodical LF-band signal from
the vehicle which enables it to transmit the response signal
in a UHF band. In North America, 315MHz is assigned for
the UHF-band, whereas 433.92MHz or 868MHz is assigned in
Europe [40]. For security reasons, packets are encrypted with
a long-term secret key that is shared between a remote key
fob and its corresponding vehicle in advance. It is noted that
in the PKES system, a driver is even able to start the engine
without inserting a physical key into the ignition switch.
In an RKE system, UHF-band signals from the key fob are
transmitted unidirectionally. Only when the driver presses the
button on the key fob is the UHF-band signal transmitted. Fig.
1b illustrates an example of the messages ﬂow for veriﬁcation
in the RKE system. The transmission of the same RF signals
from a remote key fob is repeated multiple times to increase
the reliability of communication [40].

B. Digital Communication
The information source (i.e., binary code) is encoded to be
delivered via wireless communication. Next, encoded binary
information is mapped into a symbol and conveyed to an
analog RF signal (the so-called baseband signal) through
various modulation schemes. Frequency shift keying (FSK)
and amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation are the most
common methods for modulating RF signals in keyless entry
systems. Speciﬁcally, symbol consists of several bits. But in the
case of Binary-ASK and Binary-FSK where a symbol consists
of a single bit, the meaning can be seen as interchangeable.
Since most keyless entry systems use BFSK or BASK, for the
remainder of this paper, we will use the terms interchangeably.
BFSK expresses bits 0 and 1 by shifting the frequency
of the baseband signal by a speciﬁc frequency deviation based
on the center frequency fc. The center frequency fc means the
frequency of the carrier signal. A carrier signal is a sinusoidal
wave with a carrier frequency. This carrier frequency is deﬁned
as standard according to its application and region. That is, fc
of a UHF-band signal is 315MHz or 433.92MHz and fc of an
LF-band signal is 125 ∼ 135Khz. Fig. 2 shows an example of
one FSK and one ASK modulated signal corresponding to the
binary code. In FSK modulation, if a sinusoidal wave of the
frequency fc + fd, which is higher than the center frequency
by fd indicates bit 1, a sinusoidal wave having a frequency
of fc − fd, which is lower than the center frequency by fd,
indicates bit 0. The fd indicates the frequency deviation. BASK
expresses 0 and 1 bits using the amplitude of sinusoidal with
center frequency fc. If a sine wave having an amplitude of
A0 indicates bit 1, a sine wave having an amplitude of 0
indicates bit 0. Finally, the baseband signal is mixed with a
carrier signal and transmitted through an antenna. Since a high-
frequency electric signal is emitted from the antenna, the RF
signal can be physically transmitted through the air in the form
of an electromagnetic wave. At the receiver side, the received
signal is processed through a mixer, demodulator, and decoder
- reverse order of the transmission process. We refer readers
to [59] for further reading on digital communication.
III. SYSTEM MODEL
This section presents the system overview, including how
HODOR detects malicious attacks on keyless entry systems. For
3
Fig. 3: System model
a clear understanding of HODOR, we deﬁne the attack model
that simulates the actions of adversaries and their capabilities.
A. System Overview
In this subsection, we present
the system overview of
HODOR. The vehicle should verify the UHF-band signals emit-
ted from the key fob. Therefore, HODOR should be equipped
with an RF receiver and mounted to the vehicle and integrated
with the Body Control Module (BCM) of a car which controls
various electronic accessories in the car’s body. One typical
function of BCM is transmitting a lock/unlock command
packet through the in-vehicle network communication such as
CAN or LIN. In the case of an attack being detected, HODOR
raises an attack detection alarm and BCM does not transmit
the CAN packet which contains the unlock command. Fig. 3
illustrates the overall system model of HODOR.
B. Attack Models
We present a new attack model for PKES systems. Our
attack model covers attacks on PKES systems, which were
implemented with the LF/UHF band RFID communication. In
addition, our attack model also covers existing demonstrations
of attacks on RKE systems using UHF band RFID communica-
tion. In our attack model, the main objective of a hypothetical
adversary is to unlock a vehicle. For the simplicity of the attack
model, we excluded other functions, such as an engine start
message. In addition, physical damage to a vehicle is beyond
the scope of our attack model, regardless of whether doors
are successfully unlocked via a malicious message. Three
different types of attacks on PKES systems were outlined in
our attack model in regards to how an adversary might deliver
a valid message that enables the agent to unlock doors. For
a relay attack, we categorized these into Single-band relay
attack and Dual-band relay attack. Two adversaries must
collaborate to accomplish either a single-band or dual-band
relay attack because relayed signals are used in this model
to extend communication range. In a Cryptographic attack,
however, there is a single adversary who attempts to unlock
doors on the keyless entry system. In addition to the attack
model on the PKES system, we also considered an attack
model for the RKE system. In Attacks on RKE system, we
demonstrate that all known attacks on RKE systems can be
grouped into the two categories.
1) Single-band relay attacks:
In the PKES system, a
vehicle transmits a veriﬁcation request to the corresponding
key fob using the LF-band RFID communication. When the
request is received in the LF band, the key fob automatically
responds in the UHF band. The PKES system was originally
intended to only operate within the LF-band communication
range (e.g., 1 ∼ 2 meters). However, by relaying an LF-band
request from a vehicle to its key fob, an adversary is able to
make a key fob respond to a request within the UHF-band
communication range (e.g., up to 200 meters) even if it is out
of the LF-band communication range. It should be noted that
the communication range of a key fob differs per manufacturer.
In essence, a single-band relay attack aims to relay an LF-band
request to the key fob, in which case the UHF-band response
for the LF-band request is directly transmitted to the vehicle.
In other words, the UHF-band response is not relayed and is
transmitted within its communication range. This paper focuses
on the UHF-band RF signals emitted from key fobs, and, as
such, does not consider how the LF-band signals are relayed
to the key fobs.
2) Dual-band relay attacks: Unlike a single-band relay
attack, a dual-band relay attack is not only able to relay
