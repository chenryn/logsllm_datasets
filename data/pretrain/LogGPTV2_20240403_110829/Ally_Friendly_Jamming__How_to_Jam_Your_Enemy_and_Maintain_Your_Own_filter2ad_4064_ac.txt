(e.g., RS2 in Figure 8), we have

, u ∈ [r, . . . , r + l − 1],
where xi,u is the received signal from the authorized trans-
mission. The stableness of ci,u is corrupted by xi,u, as
shown in Figure 9 (b). Thus by imposing a threshold on
the standard deviation of the estimated channel coefﬁcient,
we can detect the existence of an authorized transmission
under ally jamming.
To ensure that authorized device does not miss authorized
transmissions, we set the re-synchronization interval T as a
value smaller than the minimal packet transmission duration.
2) Recovery of Authorized Transmissions: To remove the
ally jamming signals, the authorized device ﬁrstly needs
to estimate the corresponding components from the ally
jammer in the received, mixed signals, then subtract them
out to recover the detected transmissions.
Let us use the scenario shown in Figure 8 as an example,
where the authorized device re-synchronizes successfully
in RS1, but fails in RS2 due to the collision. Since re-
synchronization in RS1 is successful, the authorized device
can obtain the received ally jamming symbols in this interval
(i.e., yi,k, . . . , yi,k+l−1 in Figure 8), which contain no strong
interference (other strong signals, e.g., authorized transmis-
sion signals). As the frequency offset is already compensated
for and the SNR is high, the least-square (LS) estimator can

be employed to obtain a sufﬁciently accurate estimation of
both h and γ.
The re-synchronization failure in RS2 is caused by the
collision of an authorized transmission with the ally jam-
ming signals. Assuming the received signal components
from the authorized transmission are xi,v, . . . , xi,w,
the
corresponding received ally jamming signal components
in collision are yi,v, . . . , yi,w, then the received collided
symbols mi,v, . . . , mi,w, are given by
mi,u = yi,u + xi,u + ni,u, u ∈ [v, . . . , w].

Note that as the authorized device does not know the
boundary of the authorized transmission, it will recover all
the signals between two succeed re-synchronizations (i.e.,
all signals between RS1 and RS3 in Figure 8). Moreover,
the authorized device can also use the received signals in
the later successful re-synchronization interval to estimate
the channel coefﬁcients and recover transmission in previous
intervals. For example, in the scenario shown in Figure 8,
the authorized device can use yi,q, . . . , yi,q+l−1 in RS3
to estimate the channel, and recover the transmission in
mi,v, . . . , mi,w.
E. Dealing with Multiple Ally Jammers
When an authorized device joins the system, it is likely
that more than one ally jammers exist
in the network,
the authorized device needs to be able to remove the ally
jamming signals from multiple ally jammers.
1) Synchronization with Multiple Ally Jammers: The au-
thorized device can compute the spectrum of the received
signals through FFT and identify all ally jammers by detect-
ing all the spikes on the spectrum. It can further compensate
for their frequency offsets and synchronize with each ally
jammer through correlation.
Let us use an example to illustrate the process. Assuming
that there are n active ally jammers, from AJ1 to AJn, and
the received signals at the authorized device are Y , which
contain the jamming signals from all ally jammers. For one
ally jammer, say AJg, if the authorized device does FFT on
the received signals, it will ﬁnd a spike within [(2g − 2) ·
fmax, 2g · fmax), which indicates that AJg is jamming the
channel. And then the authorized device can compute their
frequency offset Δfg and ﬁnd out AJg’s key kg which can
be used to generate the jamming signal sequences used by
AJg, say sg(1), sg(2), . . . , sg(n).
Since the received signals Y contain the ally jamming
signals from multiple ally jammers, we cannot compen-
sate for AJg’s frequency offset on Y directly without
disrupting other ally jammers’ frequency offsets. To ad-
dress this problem, the authorized device applies Δfg on
sg(1), sg(2), . . . , sg(n) to mimic the same frequency offset
effect. Then it can correlate the frequency offset compen-
sated sg(1), sg(2), . . . , sg(n) with Y to synchronize with
the ally jammer AJg. Thus by ﬁnding out all the pilot
frequency spikes on spectrum and repeating this process n
times, the authorized device is able to synchronize with all
ally jammers.
2) Authorized Transmission Detection & Recovery: The
detection of the authorized transmission under multiple ally
jammers is similar to the detection under single ally jammer:
when there is no authorized transmission,
the estimated
channels between these multiple ally jammers and the au-
thorized device tend to be stable in short period (e.g., several
milliseconds).
In the previous n active ally jammers example, the au-
thorized device can get sample y(k) which contains ally
jamming signals from all n ally jammers. As the frequency
offsets have already been compensated for, we have
y(k) =
cg · sg(k) + n0(k), k ∈ [1, n],
n(cid:2)
g=1
where cg = hgejγg is the channel coefﬁcient between the
ally jammer AJg and the authorized device, sg(k) is the
jamming signal sent by the ally jammer AJg and n0(k) is
the white noise in received sample y(k). Assuming y =
[y(1), y(2), . . . , y(n)]T , sg = [sg(1), sg(2), . . . , sg(n)]T
and n0 = [n0(1), n0(2), . . . , n0(n)]T , we have

The distribution of the noise n0 is known, and we know all

the LS estimator can be used to solve the above equation
and get the estimated channel coefﬁcients
[c1 c2 . . . cn]T = (SH S)−1
SH y,
where S = [s1 s2 . . . sn], ()H denotes the conjugate trans-
pose and ()−1 is the matrix inverse operation. The authorized
device can use different received signals to compute multiple
versions of [c1 c2 . . . cn] and further compute the standard
deviation of each channel coefﬁcient. If the mean value of
all these standard deviations is larger than a threshold, then
an authorized transmission is detected, the authorized device
should start to remove the ally jamming signals.
By detecting the authorized transmission, the authorized
device knows whether the received signals contain autho-
rized transmission signals or not. Therefore, it can use the
transmission-free samples to estimate the channel coefﬁ-
cients [c1 c2 . . . cn], then apply these channel coefﬁcients
to estimate the received ally jamming signals in the received
collided signals and ﬁnally subtract them out to recover the
detected transmission.
F. Dealing with Multiple Authorized Transmitters
In practice, it is possible that multiple authorized trans-
mitters exist in the network. Since ally jamming signals
will always occupy the channel, the traditional media access
control (MAC) protocol (e.g., CSMA/CA) for wireless net-
working cannot be applied. It turns out that the transmission
detection techniques can be used to solve this problem.
Before sending any packets, the authorized transmitter
listens to the channel and computes the channel coefﬁcients
between itself and the multiple ally jammers by using the
techniques described in Section IV-E. Suppose that there are
n ally jammers and the computed channel coefﬁcients are
[c1 c2 . . . cn]. If [c1 c2 . . . cn] are stable for sometime
(e.g., DIFS), then there is no other ongoing transmissions
and the authorized transmitter will start to transmit, other-
wise, it will back-off for some random time, listen to the
channel and compute [c1 c2 . . . cn] again.
V. ANALYSIS
In this section, we provide an analysis of the proposed ally
friendly jamming technique, including ally jamming power
control and the limitation discussion.
Let us ﬁrst clarify the notations. We denote the power
of received ally jamming signals, the power of a received
transmission (from either an authorized or unauthorized
transmitter), and the power of received noise as J, R,
and N0, respectively. The jamming to signal power ratio
at the receiver side is JSR = J
R , the Signal to Noise
Ratio is SN R = R
N0 . For simplicity, we assume authorized
and unauthorized receivers observe the same received ally
jamming powers and the same received transmission powers.
A. Maintaining Authorized Communication
We would like to understand how well the authorized
communication can be maintained through analyzing the Bit
Error Rate (BER) at authorized devices. According to [11],
the BER of a wireless device is mainly dependent on its
Signal
to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) and the
modulation method.
Let x be the portion of the ally jamming signal power that
can be removed using our techniques. Consider the situation
where the authorized devices use BPSK for modulation.
Based on the result in [11], we can derive the BER as
(cid:9)(cid:10)
(cid:11)
P a
e

SN R

+ JSR(1 − x)
,
where Q(·) is the Q-function (i.e., Q(x) is the probability
that a standard normal random variable will obtain a value
larger than x). Figure 10 (a) gives the BER values w.r.t.
SN R can be ignored as SNR is high
x and JSR, where
enough. The results for other modulation methods can be
derived similarly.
1
In our experiments, the percentage of removed jamming
power x is between 99.2% and 99.6% (See Figure 14).
It is generally agreed that wireless communication can be
well maintained when the BER is less than 10−3 [13]. This
implies that we can maintain authorized wireless communi-
cation even if the JSR is as high as 17dB.
B. Disabling Unauthorized Communication
We consider three kinds of unauthorized devices: ordinary
ones that do not use any anti-jamming techniques, those with
DSSS-based anti-jamming capability, and those with FHSS-
based anti-jamming capability.
1) Ordinary Unauthorized Devices: Unauthorized de-
vices do not know the secret keys, and thus cannot regenerate
the ally jamming symbols and remove them from the re-
ceived signals. An ordinary unauthorized device may attempt
to guess the jamming symbols to remove the jamming
signals. Note that the random generation of the ally jamming
symbols is essentially to randomly pick points from the
constellation map. Even assuming a coarse-grained random
generation with only 10 possibilities for the real and the
imaginary parts of a random jamming symbol, there are
102 possible symbols in total. The probability of guessing
y consecutive symbols right will be 10−2y, which quickly
approaches 0 when y increases. Thus, the probability of
removing the ally jamming signals through random guessing
is very close to 0.
Based on the results in [11], if BPSK is used for modu-
lation, the BER for an unauthorized device is
