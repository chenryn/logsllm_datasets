# Environment
    Windows build number: 10.0.18362.0
    Windows Terminal version: 0.5.2681.0
    Powershell Core: 6.2.1
    Powershell Modules:
    posh-git: 1.0.0
    PSReadLine: 2.0.0
I'm not able to reproduce this bug outside git repos, so I think this is
somehow related to posh-git (or maybe the PS1 variable).
> I'm not sure if this is a problem with posh-git or the terminal itself, so
> I'm posting here looking for some guidance.
# Steps to reproduce
If you're using posh-git, open the terminal on a GIT repository and type
something with 3 or more characters.
# Actual behavior
The line moves one column left.

## Update
Digging a little bit more into this I've found that this doesn't happen on a
branch with no upstream tracking — which is represented by that 3 vertical
lines character on posh-git.
So maybe it's related with the `≡` character?
