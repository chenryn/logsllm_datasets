### Improper Practices and Strategies in App Store Optimization (ASO)

#### Proof of Work Details
- **Device Consistency**: Participants noted the importance of using the same device for multiple reviews. Further details are provided in § 5.12.
- **Improper VPN Use**: P10 highlighted that using a VPN for login can trigger fraud detection, suggesting that it is safer to log in from a normal IP and then write the review using a VPN.
- **Improper App Use**: P12 mentioned that Google may delete reviews if users do not use the app and keep it installed for an extended period. More information is available in the app retention section of § 5.5.
- **Extended Account Use**: P3, P9, and P18 reported that writing many reviews from the same account in a short time can trigger red flags.
- **Google Fraud Detection Misfires**: P6 pointed out that sometimes genuine reviews are deleted, while multiple reviews from the same device are not.

#### User Account Validation
- **Email vs. Phone Number**: P2 and P3 prefer using email for account validation, but P3 noted that Google may require phone numbers. P16 claimed that virtual phone numbers are accepted by Google, while others use real phone numbers.
- **Innovative Solutions for Phone Number Validation**:
  - **Friends and Family**: P3, P10, P11, and P17 use friends and family's phone numbers. For example, P3 said, "We use our friends and family’s phone numbers. I meet a friend on the road, ask him to check the message, and use his phone number to verify an account."
  - **SIM Card Purchases**: P10 mentioned that in Bangladesh, one person can buy up to 20 SIM cards using their credentials. He used at least 200 phone numbers for 450 Gmail accounts.
  - **Borrowing SIM Cards**: P5 borrowed SIM cards from friends.
  - **Verification Services**: P7 and P15 use paid services to get one-time codes via SMS. P7 stated, "We pay other people to get a one-time code from their mobile SMS to verify those accounts."
  - **Purchasing Validated Accounts**: P13 buys pre-validated user accounts.

- **Phone Number Reuse Limitations**:
  - P3 and P8 reported that one number can be used for 3-5 accounts but not immediately.
  - P1 stated, "Between two verifications using the same number, we have to wait at least 3 months."

#### Review Without Installation
- **Reviewing Without Installing**: P5, P10, P13, and P18 mentioned a method to review an app without installing it: "Click on install, then stop the installation immediately. The app will not be installed, but it will allow us to write a review." This was tested and verified to work, bypassing Google's intended security design.

#### App Installation and Use
- **Waiting and Using the App**:
  - P5 and P9 wait a few hours before reviewing the installed app.
  - P9 uses the app for 5-10 minutes.
  - P6 and P8 open the app 1-2 times before reviewing.
  - P7 uses the app as a normal user.
  - P10, P13, and P16 keep the app open for 3-15 minutes before writing the review.
  - P12, P14, P17, and P18 recommend opening the app for a few minutes and using it before reviewing.
  - P4 said, "We try to navigate all the pages of the app before writing the reviews."

- **Retention Installs**:
  - All participants admitted to performing retention installs. P10 explained, "Google takes 72 hours to verify the review. If you delete the app in this period, Google will drop the review."
  - Most participants keep the app for a few days after reviewing: 1 day (P1, P5, P15), 2-3 days (P4, P5, P8, P10, P13, P14), 1-2 weeks (P17), and 7 days to 2 months (P2).
  - P4 stated that his workers keep the app until they need the space.

#### Upvoting and Downvoting
- **Upvoting Reviews**: Six participants (P5, P7, P10, P14, P15, P16) upvote reviews written by their team from other accounts. P7 said, "We upvote the reviews put by our team and also other positive reviews."
- **Downvoting Negative Reviews**: P10 downvotes negative reviews to trigger Google's filtering mechanism and remove them. P7 provides upvoting and downvoting services to move positive reviews to the top and negative ones to the bottom.

#### Singleton Accounts
- **Creating and Abandoning Accounts**: P1, P2, P7, P10, P13, and P15 create accounts just to post one review and then abandon them. P1 and P2 reported higher costs ($8 and $10, respectively) due to the effort required to create these accounts.
- **Reason for Singleton Accounts**: Participants mentioned that Google does not filter reviews from singleton accounts because its fraud detection module needs more information to build a reputation for the account.

#### Account Blending
- **Old and New Accounts**: 12 participants reported seeing jobs requiring only old accounts, while P1, P2, P7, P10, P11, P13, and P15 worked on jobs using only fresh accounts. P10 stated, "We do it because Google always keeps the reviews received from new accounts."
- **Mix of Old and New Accounts**: P1, P2, P7, P16, and P18 regularly use a mix of old and new accounts. More details on account creation and purchase strategies are in § 5.13.

#### Noisy Reviews
- **Avoiding Detection**: P2, P3, P5, P7, P10, P13, P15, and P16 do not review other apps to avoid detection. P1, however, reviews random products. Seven participants with online and organic teams (P4, P6, P8, P11, P14, P17, P18) have their online team members review other apps they normally use in real life. P4 said, "That’s why we use real users. We don’t need to follow any strategy. The real users’ behaviors serve the purpose of authenticity. We always instruct them to use other popular apps from their accounts."

#### Device Reset
- **Resetting Virtual Devices**: P10 flushes the virtual device and changes its MAC address before logging in to an account. After using the account and virtual device pair for a few days, they log out and repeat the process with another account, leaving the previous account unused for 1-1.5 months. P13 similarly stays logged in for 3 days, then resets the device using CCleaner before logging in to the next account.

#### VPN Use
- **Using VPNS**: P1, P3, P5, P13, and P15 use VPNs, while the other 10 explicitly claimed not to use them. P3 said, "We use VPN or proxy only when it is required in the job specification. For example, if I need to install from the USA, we have to use a USA proxy server."

#### Emulator Use
- **Virtual Devices**: P10 and P13 use virtual devices running on laptops, while others use mobile devices or have access to real users with mobile devices.

### Summary
- **Behavioral Adjustments**: ASO workers adjust their behaviors to avoid detection, including using VPNs and mobile device emulators. However, improper use of VPNs can also trigger fraud filters.
- **Genuine Reviews**: Some participants write genuine reviews for products they have not been hired to promote, especially those who recruit and use organic ASO workers.
- **Upvoting and Singleton Accounts**: Some participants upvote their own reviews and use singleton accounts, exploiting cold-start problems in Google's fraud detector.
- **Bypassing Verification**: Participants use ingenious solutions to bypass Google-imposed verifications and validate user accounts with real phone numbers.
- **Review Without Installation**: Participants can bypass Google's checks to prevent reviews without prior app installation.
- **Review Burst vs. Campaign Length**: Some participants post fake reviews in rapid bursts, while others control the rate of posting to avoid detection. Campaign lengths vary, with some lasting up to 18 months.
- **Accounts Per Device**: Mixed strategies include using one account per device and multiple accounts per device. Some participants log in to multiple accounts (2-5) from a single device.

### Quantitative Investigation
- **Review Distribution**: Figures 8(a) and 8(b) show the distribution of the number of reviews per day and the inter-review times. Some participants post reviews in bursts, while others space them throughout the day.
- **Active Intervals**: Figure 9 shows the active intervals for ASO workers, with some being active for more than a year for certain apps.

### Lockstep Behaviors
- **Frequent Itemset Mining**: To investigate lockstep behaviors, frequent itemset mining was used to discover sets of apps co-reviewed by many accounts in the same or similar order. 25 out of 39 participants had maximal frequent itemsets, indicating they used at least half of their accounts to review common subsets of apps.

This summary provides a comprehensive overview of the various strategies and practices used by ASO workers to manipulate app store reviews and ratings, highlighting both the challenges and the innovative solutions they employ.
