Question: "Why is it recommended to report a security event of the type 'The installation of this device is forbidden by system policy' if the 'Subject\Security ID' does not correspond to the SYSTEM account?"
 "A": "Because the SYSTEM account is a placeholder for any unauthorized user"
 "B": "Because SIDs that do not match the SYSTEM account may indicate an attempt by a non-system user to install a device, which could be a policy violation or a security issue"
 "C": "Because SIDs are always supposed to match the SYSTEM account for all security events"
 "D": "Because non-SYSTEM SIDs are indicative of a malfunctioning security event logging system"
Answer: B
