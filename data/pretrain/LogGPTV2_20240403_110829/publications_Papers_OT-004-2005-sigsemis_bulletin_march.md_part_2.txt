currently exploiting ontologies with millions to tens of millions entity and relationship instances. And yes, the
promise of scaling these Enterprise and industry scale islands by interconnecting them (and achieve what Tim
Berners-Lee called network effect) exists anyways.

Semantic Web Services:
Progress in 2004 and trends for 2005

Progress in 2004
In 2004, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI), an initiative of academic and industrial researchers – from Europe, Asia and the
United States – has been composed to create infrastructure that combines Semantic Web and Web services to enable the automation in
all aspects of Web services. In addition to providing further evolution of OWL-S, SWSI will also be a forum for working towards
convergence of OWL-S with the products of the SWWS/WSMO/WSML/WSMX research effort, which supplies Web service providers
with a core set of constructs for describing the properties of their Web services in computer-interpretable form.
Ongoing projects, such as OWL-S, LSDIS METEOR-S, and DERI SWWS studied important aspects
related to the lifecycle of semantic web processes. Industrial researchers have also been deeply involved in the
definition of standards assuring the real world implementation and use of Semantics, Web services, and Web
processes. Ongoing work on standards included the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services
(BPEL4WS, or simply BPEL) (from Microsoft, IBM, BEA), WSCL (from HP), BPML (from Microsoft),
WSCI (from SUN, BEA, Yahoo, and other), XLANG (from Microsoft), and WSFL (from IBM).
Trends for 2005
According to analysts, the Semantic Web, which will understand human language, will replace the current Web by 2005. The
progresses made are slow but steady. Therefore, we believed that this milestone will be more likely pushed to 2010.
Important aspects of research that need to be further explored include functional and behavioral descriptions
of Web services and Web processes.
Nowadays, there are few commercial products available that have successfully implemented a semantic
layer alongside robust a Web services infrastructure, this despite significant industrial support which exists for
standards such as WSDL, BPEL, and UDDI. Many vendors seem to be taking a “wait-and-see” approach while
the emerging standards converge.
In 2005, the hesitation shared by most commercial vendors will not be shared by many industrial research
groups – IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu have will further apply semantics to Web services for
innovative, discovery-driven use cases. Leadership from DERI and the W3C have each expressed a strong
interest in converging the best of each specification – vendors will no doubt wait for this alignment, which
could occur in 2005, prior to implementing either on their own.

An Interview with Prof. William King
University Professor, Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Founding President of AIS
“Leading scholars is like “herding cats.”
1. Miltiadis: Dear Prof King we are delighted that you agreed to this interview. Let’s start by asking you to provide
me with some info about the foundation of AIS. You were its founding President and First Executive Director.
How difficult was it to set it up and what was your ultimate objective?
Although there was strong dissent from those who felt that existing organizations served their own
needs, I found that very senior people in IS generally agreed on the need for a professional
organization to speak for, and to, IS academics. So, I concluded that, rather than debate or study it
further, I’d just do it. AIS is quite successful, but it’s not yet truly “global,” as about 70% of
members are from North America. We need to work on that.
2. Miltiadis: Several people claim that the IS field has reached a significant maturity. AIS has grown, several
journals, etc. What are the next milestones for the evolution of the discipline? Do you feel that they are related to
the concept of the Knowledge Society?
From a pragmatic point of view, we need more publication opportunities in “A” journals. The ratio
of “A” journal papers published each year to the total AIS membership is ridiculously low. E-
journals such as the Journal of AIS seem to be the only economic solution. Of course, in a
“knowledge society,” print will be more and more minimal, but that hasn’t happened easily and
naturally as is reflected by the current status of JAIS. We need to proactively change that.
3. Miltiadis: I think that it is an extremely difficult task to chair a leading association. Throughout your career, you
have managed to serve as the chair/president of AIS and INFORMS. How difficult has it been to lead a whole
research community? - esp. knowing that the critical bet is to lead the community beyond any well-known
boundaries.
Leading scholars is like “herding cats.” But it’s important. I have set high goals and then not been
too disappointed when they sometimes weren’t fully realized. The “boundaries” notion that you
bring up is also important. I find that scholars are quite willing to accept and adapt to change, but
they are less willing to initiate it. So, that becomes the role of a “leader of scholars.”
5. Miltiadis: We are experiencing the beginning of the new century. Semantic Web, Mobile and Ubiquitous
technologies create a new context for the perceived borders of IS. What is the new context for IS research? Do we
have to face new problems?
The field of IS changes every day and I think it attracts people who know that and enjoy it. I’m no
better able to forecast the future than anyone else, but IS people will, I am confident, create it and
cope with it as the boundaries of technology expand. Although IS is in a “low” period now, so long
as we continue to address the opportunities provided by evolving technology we’ll prosper.
6. Miltiadis: What do you consider to be the top challenges for the MIS field? Do you believe that we are still
looking for the IT artifact?
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin Vol. 1 No. 3, October 2004, page 9
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
I’m not an “IS artifact” fan. I believe in pluralism, especially in such a dynamic field. The top
challenge is to remain relevant and not let rigor totally dominate. (I believe that this is a potential
problem with the top journals; not necessarily with “lesser” ones.)
7. Miltiadis: Lately it seems that we are moving away from the hard-core quantitative experimental research into the
area of qualitative research. Do you believe this new approach has the ability to address properly the current
issues in IS research?
Qualitative research complements, but certainly cannot replace, quantitative approaches. The two
can coexist and increasingly, the same researchers will be using both approaches. I think the “third
paradigm” of Design Science holds many opportunities as well.
8. Miltiadis: I have a myopic point of view, driven by my personal interest in learning and knowledge management.
How would you evaluate knowledge sharing in our research communities? Should we adopt new technologies
and innovative ideas in order to achieve more effective knowledge representation and exploitation?
E-journals, as I noted earlier, are a part of the answer. Print journals have page quotas and high
marginal costs. An expanding field needs high-quality e-journals because they have almost zero
marginal costs. For instance, JAIS has excellent editors and is sponsored by AIS, but as yet, it has
not attracted enough of the best research to warrant an “A” rating. We need to collectively make
that happen. Senior scholars should be willing to help JAIS along by submitting their best work
there. Junior scholars probably should not take the risk until journals like this are recognized to be
top quality.
9. Miltiadis: You have an excellent record on KM and a special interest to the topic. How would you judge the
evolution of KM? What is it all about? A big bubble?
It’s very faddish, but that isn’t all bad. Most new ideas go through a faddish phase and then they
get integrated into routine operations. For instance, when “quality” was faddish, there were vice
presidents of quality; now quality is integrated into everything and because few people have
“quality” in their title, some think it was just a fad. In fact, it’s a key part of everything that
organizations do. KM will go through the same lifecycle.
10. Miltiadis: Given your extraordinary interest in teaching and postgraduate studies, I would like you to share with
us your teaching paradigm. Personally, I am excited about your propositions on Andragogy.
Andragogy, as opposed to pedagogy (which means “child learning”), puts more responsibility on
the student for every part of the learning process. It is based on quite different assumptions than
those on which pedagogy is based. I’ve tried various ways to implement this; some have been very
successful and some have not.
11. Miltiadis: Things seem to evolve rapidly within the IS field. Do you believe that we have experienced any major
paradigm shift? Should we be looking forward to it?
I think that we’re overly introspective in this field. Good ideas are widely distributed among
professionals. Our major central task should be to facilitate communications and provide outlets for
good ideas. I don’t believe in trying to “standardize” anything-paradigms, artifacts, research
methods or anything else.
12. Miltiadis: Within the IS research community we seem to believe that there is a gap between practitioners and
researchers. Do you think we can benefit from each other? What are your thoughts on that?
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin Vol. 1 No. 3, October 2004, page 10
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
There is not enough exchange between the two groups. Many IS academics have good personal ties
with practitioners and the research centers certainly help, but we need to do more, especially to help
young researchers develop such ties.
13. Miltiadis: Technology versus information versus people. What would you consider the main challenge to be?
I don’t think “versus” is the right term. An IS involves all three. Some researchers will focus
primarily on one, but ignoring the others is a recipe for failure or irrelevance.
14. Miltiadis: I am sure that you have thought several times about collaboration in International Associations. Many
intangible assets, enthusiasm, a shared vision, multi-culture etc, a whole world in a snapshot. How difficult is it
to exploit all these synergies towards the common wealth? In other words, what is the role of International
associations in the new Era of Globalization?
They obviously should become more and more important. I’m not a revolutionary, but for
professional purposes, the era of the nation is over.
15. Miltiadis: Bill, next year you are co-chairing our leading international conference, ICIS 2005. Would you like to
share with us your vision for this conference?
First, we’d like to maintain the high level of research quality ─ i.e., “Do no harm.” Then, we’d like
to encourage innovation and creative thinking. We’ve got a track devoted to that and we plan to
continue the Senior Scholars “experiment” that was so successful in Washington, DC. In general,
I’d like to refocus ICIS back toward it roots ─ a conference for top-quality research. Now that we
have AMCIS, ECIS and PACIS to serve a broader set of purposes, that’s feasible.
16. Miltiadis: We have started informing the IS community about the importance of Semantic Web. What is your
general understanding on the “concept” of Semantic Web?
Creating greater “web intelligence” is an important goal. The Semantic Web is one approach to that,
but there are many issues to face and problems to solve for it to achieve its potential.
17. Miltiadis: What are your plans for the next couple of years? I am more than impressed from your activities. Only
your posts in ISWORLD from time to time show a very active researcher. Is it a life motive?
I’m so delighted to be alive after being told that I was going to die and then surviving three major
surgeries, two of which were liver transplants. When I got the Leo “lifetime achievement” award at
ICIS 04, I told them that I was now starting out on a “second life” and have the goal of earning a
second Leo in twenty years or so.
18. Miltiadis: Bill what is your opinion about the so-called next generation IS research? Is there any milestone that
you consider to be of critical importance for its evolution?
The field has been evolving toward better use, and creation of, theory that can help in solving
practical problems. I think, and hope, that will continue.
19. Miltiadis: Any thoughts that you would like to share about the formation of the New Special Interest Group on
Semantic Web and Information Systems on AIS?
It’s a very positive development. As I noted earlier, there’s great promise with the Semantic Web
and a Special Interest Group should facilitate progress.
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin Vol. 1 No. 3, October 2004, page 11
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
20. Miltiadis: Dear Bill, thank you for your time. It was an excellent talk. Would you like to share any parting
thoughts with our readers?
I hope that every academic in IS will consider how privileged we all are. We get to work on
problems that we are interested in; not on those which others direct us to do. We get to set our own
schedules for the most part. We teach subjects that we love to young people who, if we are wise,
help us to stay “forever young.” It’s harder not to be able to teach from last year’s notes, but it’s also
invigorating. We get paid for doing things that we’d do for nothing. I’ve come to work everyday of
my career excited about what good works I might do and what I might learn that day. I wish that for
everyone and I hope I can keep that outlook as long as possible.
BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
WILLIAM R. KING
William R. King holds the title University Professor in the Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of
Pittsburgh.
He was the Founding President and the first Executive Director of the Association for Information Systems (AIS)--a
global organization of 4100 Information Systems (IS) academics. He has also served as President of The Institute of
Management Sciences (now INFORMS) -- a then 8000 member international professional organization, as Editor-in-Chief
of the Management Information Systems Quarterly--the core research journal in the IS field--and twice as General Chair or
Co-chair of the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS)--the premier research conference in the field (1987
and 2005).
Dr. King has published more than a dozen books that have been translated into numerous languages and has authored
more than 300 papers in the leading journals of management science, strategic management, and information systems.
His coauthored book, System Analysis and Project Management, won the McKinsey Foundation Award as a "significant
contribution to the literature of management" and his coedited book, Project Management Handbook, was named as "Book-
of-the-Year" by the Institute of Industrial Engineers. He has received numerous other awards for his scholarly
contributions including being named an Inaugural Fellow of the Institute for Operations Research and Management
Science (INFORMS) and the Association for Information Systems (AIS) and a Fellow of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science and the Decision Sciences Institute. Recently, he was given a Leo Lifetime Exceptional
Achievement Award by AIS.
As a consultant to a wide variety of international business firms, such as Lockheed and Westinghouse (U.S.), Sulzer
(Switzerland), and IBM (Australia), Dr. King has had significant impact on management practice and policy. As a senior
staff member representing Senator Sam Nunn on the U.S. Senate Committee on the Budget, he performed studies which
have had major impact on governmental policy. He travels widely and has spent periods of time in residence in
Australia, Brazil, England, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and New Zealand while lecturing and consulting.
In his leadership roles in TIMS, Dr. King motivated major change including conceiving and implementing a joint merger
planning process between TIMS and the Operations Research Society of America that resulted, in 1994, in the creation of
INFORMS--a 15,000 member global organization. Similarly, he put ICIS on a sound financial and administrative basis for
the first time, and led activities involved in conceiving, developing, funding, implementing and selecting the first editor
for Information Systems Research, which has become a premier research journal in the IS field.
At the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. King redesigned, obtained faculty approval for, and implemented a new doctoral
program that grew substantially in size and quality under his leadership. That program is now regarded as one of the
finest in the world. He was instrumental in the award of a multi-million dollar grant to the University of Pittsburgh by
IBM Corporation for research and curriculum development in the management of information systems. An innovative
double degree, MBA-MS in MIS, "techno MBA" program was established as a result. This program is ranked as one of
the best such programs in the world. Dr. King has also been the recipient of research grants from the National Science
Foundation and numerous other sources. He has led the development of three areas of research and instruction at Katz--
management science, information systems and strategic management--and founded and directed the Strategic

AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
Management Institute. He has also been active in University-wide planning and was instrumental in the development of
a new multi-school graduate program in Telecommunications.
Dr. King received his Ph.D. from Case Institute of Technology (now Case Western Reserve University) after completing a
BS with honors in Industrial Engineering at the Pennsylvania State University and a MS from Case. He has previously
served on the faculty of Case Institute of Technology and the Air Force Institute of Technology (active military duty). He
has been married to the former Fay Eileen Bickerton for more than 40 years and is the father of three children. He is a
licensed private pilot, certified scuba diver and sailing captain and enjoys boating, skiing, and gardening.
