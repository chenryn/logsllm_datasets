absence of limiting constraints. Once we know how good a
network could be, we can then engage in incorporating these
ideas into the current Internet or study strategies for tran-
sition to a next-generation network.
Speaker Bio
Adrian Perrig is a Professor of Computer Science at the
Department of Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Insti-
tute of Technology (ETH) in Z¨urich, where he leads the net-
work security group. From 2002 to 2012, he was a Professor
of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Engineering and
Public Policy, and Computer Science (courtesy) at Carnegie
Mellon University; From 2007 to 2012, he also served as the
technical director for Carnegie Mellon’s Cybersecurity Lab-
oratory (CyLab). He earned his Ph.D. degree in Computer
Science from Carnegie Mellon University under the guid-
ance of J. D. Tygar, and spent three years during his Ph.D.
degree at the University of California at Berkeley. He re-
ceived his B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).
He is a recipient of the NSF CAREER award in 2004, IBM
faculty fellowships in 2004 and 2005, the Sloan research fel-
lowship in 2006, the Security 7 award in the category of
education by the Information Security Magazine in 2009,
the Benjamin Richard Teare teaching award in 2011, and
the ACM SIGSAC Outstanding Innovation Award in 2013.
Adrian’s research revolves around building secure systems –
in particular secure future Internet architectures.
The Internet has been successful beyond even the most
optimistic expectations. It permeates and intertwines with
almost all aspects of our society and economy. The success
of the Internet has created a dependency on communication
as many of the processes underpinning the foundations of
modern society would grind to a halt should communica-
tion become unavailable. However, much to our dismay, the
current state of safety and availability of the Internet is not
commensurate with its importance.
Although we cannot conclusively determine what the im-
pact of a 1-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, or 1-week outage of Inter-
net connectivity on our society would be, anecdotal evidence
indicates that even short outages have a profound negative
impact on governmental, economic, and societal operations.
To make matters worse, the Internet has not been designed
for high availability in the face of malicious actions by ad-
versaries. Recent patches to improve Internet security and
availability have been constrained by the current Internet
architecture, business models, and legal aspects. Moreover,
there are fundamental design decisions of the current Inter-
net that inherently complicate secure operation.
Given the diverse nature of constituents in today’s Inter-
net, another important challenge is how to scale authentica-
tion of entities (e.g., AS ownership for routing, name servers
for DNS, or domains for TLS) to a global environment. Cur-
rently prevalent PKI models (monopoly and oligarchy) do
not scale globally because mutually distrusting entities can-
not agree on a single trust root, and because everyday users
cannot evaluate the trustworthiness of each of the many root
CAs in their browsers.
To address these issues, we study the design of a next-
generation Internet that is secure, available, and oﬀers pri-
vacy by design; that provides appropriate incentives for a
transition to the new architecture; and that considers eco-
nomic and policy issues at the design stage. Such a research
environment oﬀers a bonanza for security researchers: a crit-
ically important problem space with a medley of challenges
to address, and unfettered freedom to think creatively in the
