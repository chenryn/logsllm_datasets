### Impact of Competing TCP Traffic on Interactive Real-Time Communication

#### 6. Loss Period Analysis

**Figure 6: Estimated Loss Period Levels for Audio Packets with Different TCP Flows and Initial Windows (IW)**

- **(a) With one competing TCP flow, IW3**
- **(b) With two competing TCP flows, IW3**
- **(c) With six competing TCP flows, IW3**
- **(d) With one competing TCP flow, IW10**

**Time (s):**  
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2

**Loss Period Level for Audio with 6 short TCP flows, Jitter Buffer of 40 ms**  
**Loss Period Level for Audio with 1 short TCP flow, Jitter Buffer of 40 ms**

**Normalized Packet Loss Rate:**
- 1.2
- 1.1
- 1
- 0.9
- 0.8
- 0.7
- 0.6
- 0.5
- 0.4
- 0.3
- 0.2
- 0.1
- 0

**Best - 0**  
**Worst - 5**

**Observations:**
- **Single TCP Flow (IW3):** The loss period effect does not reach the worst level and is quickly restored after the initial window around 0.2 seconds.
- **Two TCP Flows (IW3):** The initial window injection causes a more severe effect than with a single flow, but the media flow still recovers to a better level once the initial windows are transmitted. However, as the TCP flows open up their windows, causing more jitter, the loss period effect becomes notable again.
- **Six TCP Flows (IW3):** The loss period level is very poor from the start and affects almost the entire duration of the TCP transfers.
- **Single TCP Flow (IW10):** The worst loss period level immediately becomes dominant, similar to the case with six TCP flows using IW3, and remains dominant throughout the TCP flow.

#### 7. Summary of Acceptable Loss Period Effects

**Figure 7: Overview of the Acceptable Loss Period Level for an Audio Flow with Different Jitter Buffer Sizes and TCP Flows**

- **(a) IW3, 150 replications (n=1,2,6)**
- **(b) IW10, 150 replications (n=1,2,6)**

**Jitter Buffer Sizes:**
- 200ms
- 150ms
- 100ms
- 80ms
- 60ms
- 40ms

**Time (s):**  
0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2

**Normalized Packet Loss Rate:**
- 1.2
- 1.1
- 1
- 0.9
- 0.8
- 0.7
- 0.6
- 0.5
- 0.4
- 0.3
- 0.2
- 0.1
- 0

**Observations:**
- The number of acceptable media flow packets is significantly lower with IW10 compared to IW3 for all corresponding jitter buffer sizes.
- The aggressive start with IW10 is likely to cause more delay-based packet discarding at the codecs during later periods of transfer.

#### 5. Concluding Remarks

In this paper, we present the impact of concurrent TCP transmissions on interactive media flows in a high-speed cellular network. Our measurements show that media flow packets experience significant delays when competing with TCP connections, which can prevent the codec from using a substantial portion of the packets before the playback deadline. Even a moderate number of parallel TCP connections, typically used for web page responses, can cause irreparable harm to a concurrent interactive media transfer. 

Our experiments also indicate that the worst effect on the media flow during a short TCP transmission occurs during the burst of packets due to the initial TCP window transmission. An initial window of ten segments (IW10) is worse for the competing media flow than an initial window of three segments (IW3). With a competing bulk TCP transfer, the media stream becomes unusable for interactive purposes.

Given that the degradation of media flow performance is caused by the behavior of web traffic and deep buffers, our results are likely representative of other types of network access, not just cellular.
