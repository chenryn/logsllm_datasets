I would like to use
https://developers.google.com/games/services/android/turnbasedMultiplayer for
a Flutter app I am writing. How would I do that with Dart/Flutter?  
( I asked on the mailing list, then on gitter, then I asked on stack overflow
and there I was told to ask here. )  
It seems developers need a guide on using GPGS in Flutter. Thanks.
