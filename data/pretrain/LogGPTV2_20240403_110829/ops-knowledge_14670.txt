User: I'm sure this is a easy question, my Google-fu is obviously failing me.
How do I mount a filesystem using Python, the equivalent of running the shell command mount ...?
Obviously I can use os.system to run the shell command, but surely there is a nice tidy, Python interface to the mount system call.
I can't find it. I thought it would just be a nice, easy os.mount().

Surely, there is none. What would this function do on Windows?
Use the shell command instead.
