### Vue.js version
2.0.3
### Reproduction Link
https://jsfiddle.net/xereda/zbt6sn1h/42/
### Steps to reproduce
Change the values for latitude and longitude. No reactivity.
### What is Expected?
The Geolocation fields update the data object.
### What is actually happening?
The array that deals with geolocation information (MongoDB GeoJSON Object) are
not reactive.
Note the following example:
` local: { name: 'Empresa XYZ', address: 'Rua Fulano da Veiga, 888', number:
9888, geoLocation: { coordinates: [ 65.234902, 75.349902 ], type: 'Pointer' }
}`
The only fields that are not reactives are based on the internal array of the
Geolocation object. Note this:
Nome:  
Endereço:  
Número:  
Geolocalização (long):  
Geolocalização (lat):  
Geolocalização (type):
