**ATT&CK ID:** S0023  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** CHOPSTICK

As part of APT28's operations, the group utilized CHOPSTICK modules to propagate to air-gapped machines. This was achieved by writing files to USB drives, which were then used to transfer both data and command traffic between the isolated systems and the attackers' infrastructure.[1][2][3]
