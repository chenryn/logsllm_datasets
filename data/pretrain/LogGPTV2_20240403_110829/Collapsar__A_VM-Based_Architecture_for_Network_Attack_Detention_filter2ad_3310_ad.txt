cess the system using the system’s Apache account.
Unpatched Linux kernels version 2.4.x contain a
ptrace vulnerability [19], which can be exploited by
malicious local users to escalate their privileges to
root.
(cid:15) Incident: An Apache honeypot was deployed in the
Collapsar center at 11:44:03PM on 11/24/2003 and
was compromised at 09:33:55AM on 11/25/2003.
Collapsar captured all information related to the
vulnerability-exploiting process, including the in-
truder’s keystrokes after the break-in as shown in
Figure 4. The complete log of the break-in is avail-
able on the Collapsar website [18].
First a TCP connection to port 443 on the honeypot
was initiated, then the intruder sent one malicious
packet (actually several TCP segments), triggering
buffer overﬂow in the Apache web server. The ma-
licious code contained in the packets spawned a
shell with the privilege of the system’s Apache ac-
count. With the shell, the intruder quickly down-
loaded, compiled, and executed a program exploit-
ing the ptrace vulnerability [19]. Once executed,
the ptrace exploitation code gave the intruder root
privilege. After obtaining root privilege, the in-
truder downloaded a rootkit called SHv4 Rootkit
