### Table 4: Breakdown of Regex Traffic by Class and Device Type

| **Device** | **AN (Ad Net.)** | **AS (Analytics Serv.)** | **MS (Mediation Serv.)** |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Android    | 77.3             | 60.0                     | 23.6                      |
| iPhone     | 88.4             | 35.8                     | 13.7                      |
| iPad       | 65.7             | 15.6                     | 18.3                      |
|            | 65.5             | 22.2                     | 12.3                      |

### Figure 5: Popularity of Ad Networks and Analytics Services

- **Android**
  - AdMob: 74.5%
  - Millennial Media: 15.6%
  - InMobi: 18.3%

- **iPhone**
  - AdMob: 67.5%
  - iAd: 13.7%
  - Other: 18.8%

- **iPad**
  - AdMob: 84.2%
  - iAd: 15.6%
  - GreyStripe: 12.3%

In Figure 5, we present the main ad networks, mediation services, and analytics services found in our data, along with their popularity (measured as the percentage of users using them). The figure is divided into three sections, each representing a different type of service. The three bars capture the statistics for each mobile platform. Services are sorted based on their popularity among Android devices, with iAd (Appleâ€™s advertising service) included for completeness, although it is only available on Apple devices.

AdMob is clearly the dominant service across all ad networks, serving 74.5%, 67.5%, and 84.2% of all users on Android, iPhone, and iPad, respectively. The remaining market share is distributed among several other ad networks, with Millennial Media and InMobi leading on Android devices. Notably, more than 10% of users communicate with services outside the top 10, highlighting the crowded nature of this ecosystem.

On the iPad, iAd's market share is modest, being overtaken by smaller ad networks like GreyStripe and Jumptap. Mediation services are led by AdWhirl, MobClix, and Burstly, but the differences are less significant compared to ad networks.

Google's dominance in the mobile ad ecosystem is evident, with AdMob, Google Analytics, and AdWhirl (open-source but under Google's umbrella) being the leading services. This dominance is reflected in both popularity (Figure 5) and volume and flows (Figure 6).

### Figure 6: Fraction of Flows and Bytes of Google Services

- **Android**
  - AdMob: 73% of ad flows, 80% of bytes
- **iPhone**
  - AdMob: 67.5% of ad flows, 72% of bytes
  - iAd: 8% of bytes
- **iPad**
  - AdMob: 84.2% of ad flows, 90% of bytes

Google Analytics and Flurry are the only two analytics services identified in our dataset. These services are highly popular across mobile apps, even more so than mediation services. The limited popularity of mediation services suggests that mobile apps tend to interact directly with ad networks, particularly AdMob, rather than relying on third-party agencies. We hypothesize that this may be due to service quality, economic factors, or implementation details, though we cannot confirm this with our current data.

### 3.3 Type of Ad Content

As illustrated in Figure 2, ad traffic content consists of images, HTML, and JavaScript code. By examining the HTTP content type header field, we found that static content (e.g., 'image/*') accounts for 31.4%, 41.7%, and 49.1% of the ad volume on Android, iPhone, and iPad devices, respectively. The remaining portion is shared between 'text/javascript' and 'text/html', which are used to configure the client, dynamically load ads, and define their visual layout. Displaying such content within a mobile app can affect performance, as it requires a browser component embedded within the native app.

While images are static, scripts used to define ad layout, behavior, and client configurations are more dynamic. To further analyze the time variability of these scripts, we conducted additional inspections.
