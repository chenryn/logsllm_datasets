Figure 5: Ads and analytics services popularity.
In Figure 5 we show the main ad networks, mediation and analyt-
ics services found in our data, along with their popularity (in terms
of the percentage of users using them). The ﬁgure is partitioned into
three areas, marking each type of service. The three different bars
capture the statistics for each type of mobile platform. Services are
sorted with respect to the popularity for Android devices with iAd
(Apple’s advertising service) added for completeness even though
it is available only for Apple devices. AdMob is clearly the dom-
inant service across all the ad networks serving 74.5%, 67.5% and
84.2% of all users. The remaining portion of the market is shared
across many other ad networks with Millennial Media and InMobi
leading only on Android devices. Furthermore, more than 10% of
the users communicate with services outside the top 10, underlining
the overcrowded nature of this ecosystem of services. Interestingly,
the market share of iAd in iPad is modest, being overtaken even by
smaller ad networks, such as GreyStripe and Jumptap. Mediation
services are dominated by AdWhirl, MobClix, and Burstly, but in
this case the differences are less signiﬁcant than for ad networks.
Google’s main source of income is advertising2. The prominent
presence of Google in the mobile ad ecosystem is also clearly vis-
ible as AdMob, Google Analytics, and AdWhirl (open source but
under Google’s umbrella) are the dominating services. This dom-
inance can be seen in terms of both popularity (Figure 5) and also
in terms of volume and ﬂows (Figure 6). In more detail, Google
services on Android devices account for 73% and 80% of ad ﬂows
and bytes respectively whereas for iPhone devices the fraction of
volume is lower due to the presence of iAd which accounts for 8%
of the total bytes. AdMob’s presence is even stronger on the iPad
as it accounts for almost 90% of the total ad trafﬁc on the platform.
Finally, Google Analytics and Flurry are the only two analytics
services we could identify in the data set. The analysis reveals that
these services are very popular across mobile apps, going beyond
the values obtained by mediation services. The limited popular-
ity of mediation services across mobile users indicates that mobile
apps are more likely to interact directly with ad networks, namely

AdMob, instead of relying on third party agencies. We hypothesize
that this might be related to service quality, economical aspects, or
implementation details, however we cannot demonstrate this with
our data collection.
3.3 Type of ad content
As we schematically reported in Figure 2, ad trafﬁc content is
a combination of images, HTML and Javascript code. Inspecting
the HTTP content type header ﬁeld, we found that static content
such as ‘image/*’ accounts for 31.4%, 41.7%, and 49.1% of
Android, iPhone, and iPad devices’ ad volume respectively. The re-
maining portion is instead shared between ‘text/javascript’
and ‘text/html’ which are generally used to conﬁgure the client,
dynamically load an ad and deﬁne its visual layout. Displaying
such kind of content on a mobile app also affects performance as it
requires a browser component to run completely embedded within
a native app.
While images are static objects by deﬁnition, different scripts
are also used to deﬁne the ad layout and behavior or client conﬁg-
urations, so they are more subject to change. To inspect the time
