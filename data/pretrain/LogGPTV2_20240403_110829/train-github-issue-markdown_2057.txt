**Current behavior**  
The HostListener decorator is a very useful feature. We use it a lot. Very
often the events we subscribe to come from the document.  
Very often, when the HostListener fires for document level events, we need to
perform additional checks before performing any change to the application.
Most times the handler is invoked, nothing happens to the app. Since
HostListener marks the component tree as dirty, it leads to heavy re-
evaluation of many components, and hurts performance (the tree is on Push but
some paths are very long with HostListener near the leafs).
**Expected behavior**  
I would appreciate a way to use the HostListener without triggering a change
detection for the sub tree.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
An example use-case is in directives checking for clicks outside a component.
They are very common and have few implementations such as
https://github.com/chliebel/angular2-click-
outside/blob/master/clickOutside.directive.ts and
https://christianliebel.com/2016/05/angular-2-a-simple-click-outside-
directive/.  
Using these directives leads to heavy evaluation of many components.
**Angular version:** 4.0.2
