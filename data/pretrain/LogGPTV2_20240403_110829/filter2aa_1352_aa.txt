“... because as we know, there are known knowns; there are
things we know we know.
We also know there are known
unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we
do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the
ones we don’t know we don’t know.”

Some Approaches to Linguistic Stego
• Wayner ’92: Chapman & Davida ’97: handgenerated
CFGs, automatically generated syntactic templates to
produce syntactically correct text
• Chapman,
Davida
&
Rennhard
’01:
Synonym
replacement using existing texts

Some Disadvantages to these Approaches
• Hand-generation of grammars labor intensive (solved
with automatic template generation)
• semantic coherence can be problematic (CFGs)
• Not
all
synonyms
are
created
equal
(e.g.
eat
vs.
devour);
good lists must be hand-generated
(NICETEXT II)
• Additionally, pure semantic substitution may be subject
to known-cover and diﬀ attacks (NICETEXT II)

Why do these problems arise?
• Automatic generation of semantically and rhetorically
correct text is diﬃcult on its own
• Each of these approaches attempts to mimic correct
text
• Incorrect text becomes a source of deviation from the
statistical proﬁle of what is mimicked
“... hide the identity of a text by recoding a ﬁle so its statistical
proﬁle approximates the statistical proﬁle of another ﬁle.” –
Peter Wayner

Solving the Generation Problem
• If the problem is with mimicking correct text...
• Find a stego object type which:
– Is expected to be semantically and syntactically
damaged
– Is supposed to be a transformation of the original
object – both can coexist without a problem
– By nature contains errors which often causes it to
make less-than-perfect sense
“In order to prevent signiﬁcant changes of the cover material,
most steganographic algorithms try to utilize noise introduced
by usual processes.” – E. Franz and A. Schneidewind

An Example from Babelﬁsh
• The following German text was taken from a Linux Camp
website: “Keine Sorge, sie sind alle handzahm und beantworten
auch bereitwillig Fragen rund um das Thema Linux und geben
gerne einen kleinen Einblick in die Welt der Open-Source.”
• A reasonable English translation would be the following:
“Don’t worry, they are all tame and will also readily answer
questions regarding the topic ’Linux’ and gladly give a small glimpse
into the world of Open Source.”
• Babelﬁsh gave the following translation: “A concern, it are
not all handzahm and also readily questions approximately around
the topic Linux and give gladly a small idea of the world of the
open SOURCE.”

Translation as a Cover
Natural Language (NL) translation is an inherently noisy
process (MT moreso than human translation)
• Ready availability of low-quality translations makes
certain alterations plausible and errors easy to mimic
• Redundant nature of language means that translation
allows for a wide variety of outputs
• Variation of a translation does not necessarily constitute
“damage”

Natural Language Machine Translation
• Far from perfect
• Most systems are statistical engines – translate via
pattern matching and sets of syntactic rules
• Context is usually completely neglected
• Translations often word-for-word, ignoring syntactic
and semantic diﬀerences between source and target
languages

Lost in Translation (LiT): a
Translation-Based Steganographic System
We assume Alice and Bob have a shared secret in
advance – in this case, it is the translation-system
conﬁguration.
To send a message, Alice ﬁrst chooses a source text –
it might be from a public text source. It does not have to
be secret.

The System: Encoding
• Cover source text is run through several commercial and
custom-generated translation engines
• Errors, semantic substitutions, and other modiﬁcations
are made to these translations in a post-processing step
– each modiﬁcation is considered damage
• Each damaging action reduces the probability that a
sentence looks like real translation – language model
decides what modiﬁcations cause more damage
• Accumulated probabilities are used to build a Huﬀman
tree – matching bit sequence from the secret message
determines which translation sentence will be chosen

Post-pass Example: Error Insertion
Simple examples for errors when translating to English:
• Incorrect use of articles (deﬁnite/indeﬁnite, incorrect
omission/inclusion of articles)
• Prepositions are particularly tricky – because they have
so many meanings, mapping them correctly is hard
• Leave less common words in their original language
(“handzahm”)

About Post-Passes
• Which modules are run is determined by the (shared
