Since 2.7, it's recommended to use `absolute_url` to generate absolute assets
URL (http://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-2-7-the-new-asset-component).
However, in a console command, `absolute_url` does not rely on
`request_context` and, therefore, cannot generate reliable asset URLs...
**Reproduction** :
Clone: lemoinem/symfony-standard@`c5bcfb4` (branch: `bug/absolute-url-in-
command`)  
(No DB, nor mailer config required)
Command: `php app/console TEST:absolute-url`
