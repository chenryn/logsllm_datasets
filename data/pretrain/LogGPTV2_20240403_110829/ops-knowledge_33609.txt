User: When troubleshooting network faults, what are the techniques for using common commands such as ping, traceroute, and nslookup, and how to use these commands to locate faults?
Assistant: Common network troubleshooting commands and their usage skills are as follows: 1. Ping command: Test whether the network is connected and measure the response time. - Check whether the network is connected: ping the IP address or domain name. - Measure response time: ping -t IP address or domain name (continuous ping). Ctrl+C to stop. - Check if there is a problem with the ARP cache: ping -a IP address or domain name. 2. Traceroute command: View the routing of data packets from the local machine to the target host. - traceroute IP address or domain name. - -T option: use TCP protocol for tracking. 3. Nslookup command: Find domain name resolution information. - nslookup domain name or IP address. - -type option: Specify the query type (such as A record, MX record). - -debug option: Display detailed query process. The common methods of using these commands to locate faults are: 1. Check whether the network is connected: use the ping command to check whether the target host can be pinged through. 2. Check the network delay: use the response time of the ping command and the traceroute command to check the routing of the data packets and find out the bottleneck of the network delay. 3. Check the DNS resolution problem: Use the nslookup command to check whether the DNS resolution information of the target host is correct. 4. Check whether the network card or device is normal: test whether the local network card or device is normal by pinging the local loopback address (127.0.0.1). 5. Use remote tools: Use remote tools such as ssh, telnet, remote desktop, etc. to connect to the target host to view specific fault information. In short, when troubleshooting network faults, it is necessary to combine different commands and techniques, comprehensively consider the problem, and find the final point of failure.
