**Title: BotConf 2016 - Locky, Dridex, and Necurs: The Malicious Triad**

While the internal workings of Locky and Dridex have been well-documented due to their frequent media coverage, the mechanisms behind their distribution systems remain less understood, primarily because they are only observed by email providers. In this presentation, we will reveal the inner workings of the distribution networks for Locky, Dridex, and Necurs from the perspective of Gmail. We will highlight the key techniques and protocols these groups employ to evade detection and orchestrate their campaigns. Finally, we will showcase a selection of the methods used in their droppers, demonstrating the sophistication these groups have achieved in exploiting JavaScript vulnerabilities.
