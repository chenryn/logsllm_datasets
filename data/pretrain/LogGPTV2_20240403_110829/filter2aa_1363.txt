Totalfarker
Project in a nutshell
 Started as Wi-Fi mapping of Caracas, 
Venezuela
 Seeks to understand if the difference 
in wealth affects network security
 The future?, electronic fences over 
wireless?
Venezuela
Located in South America
Has a GDI of 0.826
Over 53% of the population 
lives under extreme poverty
20% of the population has access to the Internet.
86% of Venezuelans have a mobile phone (2nd in Latin 
America)
45%+ access internet from their homes, 27% of them get it 
from Wi-Fi Cafés.
67% of Internet users come from the D and E status (Poorest 
users)
Most of the poor live in slums located in the extreme east 
(Petare) and extreme west (Catia, 23 de Enero, etc)
Two big Slums in Caracas, 
One located to the west (left)
The other to the east (right)
Internet connections available
using 3G modems,
EVDO / EDGE Cell networks and
WIMAX.
Low physical security: houses (ranchos) are built using mud, 
adobes and zinc ceilings
Slums
Wealthy neighborhoods
Mostly in the Eastern and south 
eastern side of the city
Patches of high density high rise 
buildings (Mostly in the East) and 
houses / mansions in the South 
East.
Internet connections are mostly 
DSL and Cable
Wi-Fi Cafés almost inexistent
Buildings are built with concrete 
(unlike American’s card box 
constructions)
Strong physical security: Electric 
fences, watch guards, dogs, 
motion detection sensors, 
bulletproof windows and cars, 
cameras, gated communities.
Slum version of Boingo
SSID Has owner’s Cell number
Phone cards are used to purchase
wi-fi key
Key is reissued Sunday evening
Requires strong security: WPA/WPA2
Internet use is mostly recreational
(Messenger), Crime (Identity theft,
investigating kidnap victims,
blackmail) or illegal informal economy
(piracy of movies, music, software)
Wi-Fi Cafés and Internet use
Acer Aspire One with Atheros
chipset
Backtrack 4 beta + Kismet
Volkswagen FOX 2008 and driving like crazy!

Notes on results - Slums
The results taken from the samples in the slums tend to show that people 
living in the slums hold great value for their internet and their network 
security. Internet afterall is a commodity, one that doesn’t come cheap 
for them, hence the need to use stronger security mechanisms to 
prevent theft of it.
Special note should be taken of Wi-Fi Cafés, which offer unlimited Internet 
over wireless for a set period of time and due to the nature of their 
business, they must provide a high level of security in their network to 
protect against theft and incurring in losses. This in turn drives 
conscience of security on the people who use the service.
Finally, one should look at how low physical security in the slums affects the 
population, Caracas is by far the most dangerous city in the world ranked 
No 1 murder capital with over 130 killings for every 100k residents, 
followed by Cape Town with 62 per 100k (almost half). Ranchos (Slum 
houses) don’t offer much protection from theft, vandalism, stray bullets. 
Yet people in the slums activate advanced encryption techniques to 
protect against Internet service theft.
Notes on results - Wealthy
Results from wealthy areas aren’t exactly astonishing and predicted by the 
hypothesis, Internet is highly available on wealthy areas from different 
sources, 3G, WiMAX, EDGE/EVDO, DSL, Cable, Satellite, calls for a 
high demand of legal internet service, one that isn’t shared and allows 
full bandwidth speed.
Special note on the difference between High Rise buildings and houses, the 
first one, specially in the Chacao area there exists a very high
concentration of Wireless networks, whereas in residential (almost 
suburban) house complexes there is low concentration. This comes from 
population density and signal dissipation (Over yards and several walls). 
The 400 sample had to be taken from both slums and rich areas because 
of the low amount of wireless networks available in the South Eastern 
side (house complexes)
Finally, the wealthy areas have strong physical security, like gated 
communities, electric fences, guards, dogs, cameras and motion 
detection sensors. Yet, they don’t use advanced encryption techniques, 
settling for ‘router defaults’ (Indeed, a large number of default SSID’s 
where seen) or a high number of unsecured networks.
