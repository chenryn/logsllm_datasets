### Apache Airflow Version
- **Version**: 1.10.12

### Environment
- **Cloud Provider or Hardware Configuration**: Google Cloud Composer (customized environment running Airflow RBAC UI)

### Issue Description
In the Airflow RBAC UI, when navigating between pages, an 'Access is Denied' error message appears, indicating missing permissions on the previously visited page. This behavior can be confusing in certain scenarios.

#### Observed Behavior
1. **Admin Role Change Scenario**:
   - As an Admin, I navigate to the "List Users" page.
   - I click "Edit" on my user record and change my role from Admin to Viewer.
   - After clicking "Save," I am redirected to the home page, which displays a green "Changed Row" message and a red "Access is Denied" message.
   - **Confusion**: The mixed signals make it unclear whether the role assignment was successful and which access was denied. The "Access is Denied" message is related to the unsuccessful load of the "List Users" page, but this may not be obvious to all users.

2. **Variable Import Permission Scenario**:
   - If I lack the `can_varimport` permission on the `VariableModelView` and attempt to import variables, I am redirected to the home page with an 'Access is Denied' message.
   - **Confusion**: It is unclear which specific permission is missing. Users might incorrectly assume they lack permission to the file itself, rather than the necessary permission to perform the import action.

3. **Asynchronous Work and Permission Removal**:
   - In Airflow 1.10.10, removing certain permissions required for asynchronous work on the homepage and then navigating to an unrelated page (e.g., "List Roles") resulted in an unexpected 'Access is Denied' message.
   - **Confusion**: The message appeared on an unrelated page, making it difficult to determine the cause. This issue is no longer reproducible in Airflow 1.10.12, but the underlying UX concern remains.

### Expected Behavior
The 'Access is Denied' error message should clearly indicate which specific page or fragment it refers to. This would help users understand which permissions are missing and why the error occurred.

### Reproduction Steps
To reproduce the issue, follow the steps described in the "Observed Behavior" section.

This behavior may be deeply integrated into Flask-AppBuilder and challenging to modify. However, it remains a significant UX concern for Airflow.
