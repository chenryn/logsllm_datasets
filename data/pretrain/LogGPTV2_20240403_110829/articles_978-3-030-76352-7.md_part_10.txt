s∈S? Can this selection be performed in a computationally efficient way?
– How are the QoS profiles obtained? Are they manually designed or can they
be automatically constructed?
Our vision for this research project is to explore, from both a theoretical
and a practical point of view, the boundaries of what can be formally specified
and automatically analyzed concerning Quality of Service and non-functional
requirements. For this we leverage on the existing literature about the problem
and approach the research from a Formal Methods [2,10] perspective.

There has been extensive discussion on what constitutes non-functional require-
ments [5,15]. Nevertheless, most of the research in service selection has focused
onQoSattributesthatallowsometypeofmeasurement.Wefollowthisassump-
tionsinceitisaconsequenceofhavingformaltreatmentandautomaticanalysis
as goals and, according to the taxonomy of requirements presented in [5], we
call this subset quantitative attributes. Some examples of these attributes are
response time, memory usage, price, reputation, etc. For an extensive study of
the state of the art in the service selection problem, we point the interested
reader to [14] where Moghaddam et al. present a comparative review of existing
approaches and to [7] where the authors perform a systematic literature review.
A clear overview of the problem and its foundations can also be found in [8].
One way of classifying the literature is by how each work models QoS
attributesandpolicies.Thisyieldsthreebroadcategories:single-valueattributes,
range-valued attributes, and probabilistic attributes. In the single-value setting
the QoS provided for a particular attribute is modelled as a constant value, an
example of this can be seen in [18] where the initial quality model proposed by
the authors is a vector with specific values of attributes such as price, dura-
tion, reputation, etc. Instead, in the range-valued setting the model is usually
an interval or a set of values (e.g. resp. time ={100,200,300,400} or resp. time
=[100,400]),adescriptionofthiskindofmodelscanbefoundin[11,Section2].
The latter perspective emerges by acknowledging the limitations of the former:
there are scenarios in which the single value model becomes insufficient. Simi-
larly, what has emerged in recent years is the proposal of models that capture
the probabilistic nature of many quality of service attributes, a recent work in
this direction can be found in [19].
In this context, one of the distinctive points of our research program is the
perspectiveoftreatingQoSattributesfromageneralpointofviewwhileaiming
to contribute with practical implementations of our proposals. Instead of study-
ingthebehaviorofspecificqualityattributessuchastime,memoryconsumption,
or availability our approach makes no assumption on the attribute other than
thattheyareinterpretedasvalues.Suchahomogeneoustreatmentofattributes
enables the modeling of interdependences between them and a more holistic
treatment of their space of values. Furthermore, this general point of view will
also have an impact when we discuss our approach to the probabilistic setting.

the development of analysis methods for such language.
Formal Quality of Service Analysis in the Service Selection Problem 57
4.1 Towards a Formalization of Quality of Service Contracts
A relatively new approach to the analysis of hybrid systems’ specification, due
to Pappas et al. [17], integrates SMT-solving [4] with convex constraints [6],
under the name of SMC – Satisfiability Modulo Convex Optimization. As a first
step of our research program, we adopted SMC as a specification language and
developed an efficient two-phase procedure for evaluating SLA based on SMC.
A formula in this language is essentially a boolean combination of convex con-
straints and propositional variables, as it is shown in the following example.
Example 1 (QoS requirement in SMC). Consider a client interested in setting
anupperboundfortheexecutiontimeoftheservicewithattributes thatmodel
theinitializationtimeandthetimeittakestoprocessakilobyteofinformation.
A possible requirement can be stated like this:
initTime+256·timePerKB ≤50
The two-phase analysis procedure for deciding whether s  Rq is adapted
to profit from the fact that specifications can be minimized in a preprocessing
phase when the service is registered in the repository. The expectation is that
such preprocessing might produce an efficiency gain when, at runtime, sRq is
checked to evaluate if an SLA is met. A detailed presentation, both theoretical
andexperimental,ofthetechniquecanbefoundin[12].Aninterestingaspectof
our proposal is that the minimization procedure is susceptible to be done incre-
mentally by performing successive partial minimizations of a given specification
before it is fully minimized. This exposes that most of the efficiency gain in the
analysisisreachedafterinvestingasmallportionofthetotalminimizationtime
required.
4.2 Quality of Service Ranking
The aforementioned view guarantees the selection of a service satisfying the
requirements of the executing application but it does not provide any insight
when there is no service whose QoS profile fully complies with those require-
ments. In this scenario, an application would be pushed to abort its execution
for there is no possible SLA on the QoS required.
A geometrical interpretation of the judgment sRq expresses that all satis-
fying values of real variables of s also satisfy Rq; on the other hand, a negative
answerjustmeansthatthereexistatleastonevaluesatisfyingsandnotsatisfy-
ingRq.Thisperspectiveopensupthepossibilityofevaluatingpartialcompliance
ofQoScontractsbyestimatingwhatwecallinclusion ratio,servingthepurpose
ofrankingservicesbytheirdegreeofQoScompliance.Adetailedexplanationof
the notion of inclusion ratio can be found in [13, Section2.1]. In the following,
we introduce the main concepts.
GivenaformulaαinaformalQoSspecificationlanguagesuchas[13,Defini-
tion 1] we define the set of values satisfying the formula as [[α]]={ x | x|=α }.
Based on this definition, proving the formula s  Rq is to check whether
58 A. E. Martinez-Sun˜´e
[[s]] ⊆ [[Rq]] (i.e. whether all of the values of the quantitative attributes offered
by the service are accepted by the requirements). Then, we propose to compute
the volume of the intersection between [[s]] and [[Rq]] relative to the volume of
[[s]], referred to as inclusion ratio. This indicator is essentially quantifying what
is the percentage of the QoS values offered by the QoS profile that are actually
accepted by the requirements contract. Under this interpretation we argue such
indicator serves the purpose of quantifying the partial compliance of Rq by s
and then, functionally compliant services can be QoS ranked by ordering them
through inclusion ratio.
We developed a prototype tool based on a state-of-art convex polytope vol-
ume estimator to analyze partial compliance of Rq by s represented as sets
of polytopes. The interested reader is pointed to [13] for further details of the
technique, together with a nontrivial discussion about its implementation in the
contextofcontractsconsistingofsetsofconvexpolytopeswithnon-emptyinter-

5 Summary
We presented a research program consisting of the development of formal lan-
guages and tools to analyze QoS attributes in the context of the Service Selec-
tion problem. In particular, our research focus on what is called quantitative
attributes, the fragment of the QoS attributes that is considered to admit for-
mal treatment. We discussed our vision and methodology in the context of the
state of the art and briefly overviewed the main contributions of our approach.
We believe the rapid development and radical transformation of cloud comput-
ing technologies give exciting possibilities for the research into Service Selection
and the treatment of QoS in the context of Service-Oriented Computing.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, knowledge graphs are backbones of many information systems that
require to have access to structured knowledge. A large number of knowledge
graphs such as YAGO [7], Freebase [1], DBPedia [4] have been constructed and
applied to many real-world applications. A knowledge graph is composed of
entities that present as nodes and relations which present as different types of
edges between nodes. While there are many openly available knowledge graphs,
self-constructed knowledge graphs in specific domains are still in need, and the
process of construction usually consumes a lot of manpower.
In this paper, we present a novel platform that takes advantage of crowd-
sourcing to construct and manage knowledge graphs. The platform aims to pro-
vide knowledge graph automatic construction as a service and reduce the ten-
ants’efforttoconstructknowledgegraphs.Tenantsareabletodefineknowledge
graph schema according to the format of their resources for building knowledge
graphs. While different tenants define knowledge graph schema differently, the

tiple tenants could contribute resources used for constructing knowledge graphs
