## Abstract
Traditional pin tumbler door locks are often compromised through lock picking and key bumping, which require physical access and increase the risk of detection. To address these limitations, we introduce Keynergy, a stealthy offline attack that infers key bittings using audio and video recordings. Keynergy leverages the audible "clicks" produced during key insertion and video footage of the victim holding the key. Our evaluation, involving 75 keys and over 3,600 insertions, shows that Keynergy can reduce the keyspace by approximately 75% using acoustics alone and to fewer than ten keys for 8% of the keys when combining both modalities.

## 1. Introduction
Pin tumbler locks are widely used for securing homes and offices, making them a frequent target for attacks. Traditional methods like lock picking and key bumping, while effective, require physical access, increasing the risk of detection. Recent locks with anti-picking and bumping features further complicate these attacks. 

To overcome these challenges, prior work proposed an image-based attack that infers key bittings from high-resolution images of stationary keys. However, this approach is impractical due to the need for high-quality, static images. 

Keynergy, our proposed solution, extends this work by using both audio and video recordings. The audio captures the "clicks" during key insertion, and the video captures the key's appearance. This combined approach allows for more practical and stealthy key inference, even with moving keys.

## 2. Primer on Pin Tumbler Locks and Keys
### 2.1 Pin Tumbler Lock Construction
Pin tumbler locks, such as the Schlage SC1, consist of five pin-pairs (p1, p2, p3, p4, p5). Each pair includes a top (driver) pin and a bottom (key) pin. When a matching key is inserted, the pins align along the shear line, allowing the lock to be opened.

### 2.2 Key Specifications
A key for a pin tumbler lock has a unique keycode (e.g., 39359), specifying the bitting depths. For Schlage SC1 keys, there are five bitting positions and ten depth values (0-9), with each adjacent depth value separated by 0.381 mm. The keyspace is reduced to 75,066 keys due to manufacturer constraints, such as the Maximum Adjacent Cut Specification (MACS).

### 2.3 Key Insertion Sound and Click Pattern Formation
During key insertion, the bottom pins fall off the ridges on the key, producing a series of "clicks." These clicks form a unique pattern that can be used to infer the key's bitting depths.

## 3. Threat Model
### 3.1 Goals and Capabilities
The attacker aims to infer the victim's key bittings using sound and video recordings. Two types of attacks are possible:
- **Proximity Attack:** The attacker records the sound and video in close proximity to the victim.
- **Distant Attack:** The attacker uses devices like parabolic microphones and telephotography cameras to record from a distance.

### 3.2 Assumptions
- The attacker knows the location of the victim's door and the lock's make and model.
- The attacker has access to key specifications.
- Upon deriving a small set of candidate keys, the attacker can replicate them using a key code cutting machine or 3D printer.

## 4. Modeling Key Insertion Sound
### 4.1 Simulated Patterns
We generate simulated click patterns based on key specifications and a constant insertion speed. These patterns help in comparing the actual click patterns obtained from the recordings.

### 4.2 Formation of Click Clusters
Simulated patterns exhibit clusters of clicks, formed due to intermittent pauses during key insertion. These clusters help in overcoming the challenges of variable insertion speeds.

## 5. Attack Design and Implementation
### 5.1 Overview
Keynergy uses multiple audio and video recordings to infer the key bittings. The process involves:
1. **Click and Cluster Detection:** Identifying clicks and clusters in the audio.
2. **Synthesized Click Pattern Computation:** Selecting the most representative insertions and stitching them into a synthesized pattern.
3. **Video Analysis:** Using video to reduce the keyspace.
4. **Pattern Comparison:** Comparing the synthesized pattern with the simulated patterns of the reduced keyspace.

## Conclusion
Keynergy presents a new avenue for sensor side-channel attacks by combining information from different sensing modalities. This work highlights the need for new defense policies to mitigate such emerging threats.
