User: Please describe the disk partition scheme in the Linux system, including the traditional MBR partition and the commonly used GPT partition, and give an example of how to perform disk partition operations.
Assistant: There are two main disk partition schemes in the Linux system: the traditional MBR partition and the commonly used GPT partition. 1. Traditional MBR partition MBR (Master Boot Record) partition is a traditional partition method, which saves the partition table and boot program in the first sector of the hard disk. MBR partition supports up to 4 primary partitions or 3 primary partitions and 1 extended partition. An extended partition can contain multiple logical partitions, but the number of logical partitions is limited. The steps for MBR partition operation are as follows: Step1: Use the fdisk command to view the disk# fdisk -l Step2: Use the fdisk command to partition the disk# fdisk /dev/sda In the fdisk partition command line, enter m to view the command help, p to view the partition table, n creates a new partition, d deletes a partition, w saves the partition table and exits. Example: Create a primary partition and an extended partition, and the extended partition contains two logical partitions. Step3: Format partition # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1 # Format primary partition # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda5 # Format logical partition 1 # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6 # Format logical partition 2 2. Commonly used now The GPT partition GPT (GUID Partition Table) partition is a commonly used partition method now. It adopts a more advanced partition method and supports larger hard disks and more partitions. In addition, the GPT partition can also boot the operating system under UEFI. The steps for GPT partition operation are as follows: Step1: Use the gdisk command to view the disk# gdisk -l /dev/sda Step2: Use the gdisk command to partition the disk# gdisk /dev/sda In the gdisk partition command line, enter m to view the command help , p to view the partition table, n to create a new partition, d to delete a partition, w to save the partition table and exit. Example: create an EFI system partition, a primary partition and a logical partition. Step3: Format partition # mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1 # Format EFI system partition # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 # Format primary partition # mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda5 # Format logical partition Summary: MBR Both partitioning and GPT partitioning have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of a suitable disk partitioning scheme needs to be decided according to the specific situation. When performing disk partition operations, you need to be very careful to prevent data loss due to misoperation.
