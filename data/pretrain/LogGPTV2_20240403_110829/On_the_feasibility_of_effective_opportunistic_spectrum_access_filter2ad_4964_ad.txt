type of access is unable to serve many of today’s applications.
5. FREQUENCY BUNDLING
The results in Section 4 demonstrate that despite the abundant
availability of partially used spectrum, the amount of spectrum ac-
tually accessible is much smaller than expected. More importantly,
the extracted spectrum is heavily fragmented and scattered across
time. Thus the equivalent channels available to secondary devices
are highly unreliable.
In this section, we examine the feasibility of building reliable
transmission channels by combining together multiple unreliable
frequencies, utilizing frequency diversity to compensate for the lack
of reliability on individual channels. We refer to this method as fre-
quency bundling.
Frequency bundling is both feasible in practice and attractive to
primary and secondary users. Recent advances in radio hardware
design make frequency bundling practical for secondary users. New
frequency-agile radios can combine non-contiguous frequency chan-
nels to form a single transmission [25]. This bundling can be per-
formed either before allocation by a primary user or spectrum reg-
ulator, or after allocation by the secondary users themselves.
In
the second case, care must be taken to avoid bundling contention
between secondary users.
Challenges.
Frequency bundling faces two key challenges. First,
how should secondary users choose and group channels? To re-
duce blocking time, one should group channels that complement
each other in time, i.e. negatively correlated in their spectrum us-
age patterns. This motivates us to examine the correlation across
channels using our measurement dataset. Second, given a bundle
of frequency channels, how should we design multi-channel sec-
ondary access mechanisms that effectively utilize these channels?
We address these questions in Section 5.1 and 5.2, respectively, and
examine the bundling performance in Section 5.3.
5.1 Correlation among Frequency Channels
In searching for bundling strategies, we start by examining the
correlation among frequency channels in terms of their primary
user spectrum usage patterns. For this task, we again use the RWTH
dataset because of its extensive coverage of frequency channels.
We divide each channel trace into multiple 1-hour segments and
compute pair-wise correlation among the channels by individual
segments. We do not use our segmentation mechanism from Sec-
tion 3 and 4 here, because it produces variable-length segments
among channels that cannot be used to calculate time-domain cor-
relation. We study correlation between channels within the same
service as well as across adjacent services, considering that frequency-
agile radios are likely to combine channels in close proximity.
We use two metrics to quantify correlation: Pearson’s correla-
tion coefﬁcient [17] and mutual information [12].
Metric 1: Correlation Coefﬁcient.
quences, X and Y, the correlation coefﬁcient is deﬁned as:
For any two binary se-
ρx,y = E[(X − μX )(Y − μY )]
σX σY
where μX and μY are the mean, σX and σY are the standard devi-
ation of X and Y , respectively. The value of ρx,y ranges from -1 to
1, where -1 indicates strong negative correlation, 1 indicates strong
positive correlation, and 0 indicates independency when X and Y
are jointly normal [17]. While capturing both positive and negative
correlation, this metric can only detect linear dependency.
Metric 2: Mutual Information.
It is an entropy-based quantity
for measuring the mutual dependency between any two sequences:
X
X
p(x, y) · log
p(x, y)
p(x)p(y)
I(X; Y ) =
x∈X
y∈Y
where p(x, y) is the joint probability distribution function of X
and Y , and p(x) and p(y) are the marginal probability distribution
functions of X and Y , respectively. I(X; Y ) ranges from 0 to
1, where it is 0 if and only if X and Y are independent. Unlike
correlation coefﬁcient, this metric detects general dependency.
Results. Our analysis on the RWTH dataset shows that channels
display little dependency unless they are adjacent in frequency. As
an illustrative example, Figures 11(a) and (b) plot both correlation
metrics over a day using all the GSM1800DL channels at NED.
We segment the 24-hour duration into 24 1-hour segments, and for
each hour calculate the pair-wise correlation among all the channel
pairs. We show our results by the median, 5% and 95% values
of the channel pairs. We see that all these values are close to 0,
indicating minimum correlation between channels.
Figure 11(c) shows a detailed trace of the correlation coefﬁcient
as a function of frequency separation. Again it shows that un-
less the two channels are adjacent to each other, there is no sign

of strong correlation. The strong correlation among close pairs
(those separated by less than 400KHz) can be explained by two
reasons. First, while the RWTH measurement channels are of the
same width as the GSM1800 service channels (200kHz), they are,
however, not perfectly aligned with the GSM1800 service chan-
nels. Thus, adjacent measurement channels may map to the same
service channel and hence appear heavily correlated. Second, ad-
jacent channels can produce cross-band interference to each other,
which makes them inherently correlated. The same was found from
our UCSB GSM measurement results.
We have examined other services over different time periods and
the results show very similar trends. To illustrate the general trend
across all the services, in Figure 12 we show the portion of chan-
nel pairs with correlation coefﬁcient between [-0.1,0.1] and mutual
information between [0.0.1].
In addition to considering channel
pairs within each service, we also include the result of channel pairs
across adjacent services. We see that the majority of channel pairs,
either within the same or adjacent services, display very little cor-
relation. The correlation result is service-dependent because each
service has different transmission properties and service channel
width.
Summary of Findings.
relation leads to two key ﬁndings:
Our analysis on pair-wise channel cor-
• Most of the channel pairs, either within a service or between
adjacent services, display little correlation.
• Frequency channel pairs that are adjacent in frequency dis-
play relatively high correlation.
These results imply that opportunistic spectrum access across a fre-
quency range will produce multiple channels with little correlation
in their available spectrum patterns.
5.2 Bundling Frequency Channels
The availability independency across channels means that we
can signiﬁcantly improve overall reliability by simply bundling ran-
dom channel pairs together. In the following, we ﬁrst describe three
candidate methods to access channels in a bundle, and then present
our method for forming channel bundles.
Using Frequency Bundles.
We propose three usage models,
each mapping to a speciﬁc radio conﬁguration and application type.
• Channel Switching (for simpliﬁed hardware) – We consider
secondary users with WiFi-like radios that can only access a
single channel, but can switch between channels on the ﬂy. In
this model, each user switches to another channel in the bun-
dle when the current channel becomes busy or too risky to
access. One artifact of this model is that because secondary
users cannot monitor each channel continuously, they cannot
use SKA which requires the channel usage history. Instead,
they can only use NKA and extract less spectrum.
• Channel Redundancy (for maximum reliability) – In this model,
secondary users can sense and communicate on multiple chan-
nels simultaneously. To maximize transmission reliability
and minimize blocking time, this model sends the same data
stream on all the idle channels in the bundle. When a chan-
nel becomes blocked, it skips the data stream. Because sec-
ondary users can sense and monitor each channel, they use
SKA to access each channel independently. This model fo-
cuses on maximizing reliability – unless all the channels are
inaccessible, secondary users can communicate continuously.
• Channel Multiplexing (for maximum bandwidth) – This model
also accesses multiple channels simultaneously using indi-
vidual SKA, but multiplexes the data stream across current
idle channels without any redundancy. Different from the
Redundancy model, the effective transmission bandwidth varies
over time.
Forming Frequency Bundles. We choose a random bundling
method. It takes as input, k, the bundle size, and randomly selects
k channels from the channel pool to form a bundle. We choose
this method because of two reasons. First, the best strategy to min-
imize blocking time for all three models is to combine channels
that complement each other, i.e. negatively correlated. Yet be-
cause the majority of channel pairs show no sign of correlation,
random bundling wins due to its simplicity. Second, we use ran-
dom bundling to understand the performance trend of opportunis-
tic access with different bundle sizes, and to evaluate practical sit-
uations where secondary users have a small pool of channels for
bundling. We only consider partially used channels for bundling,
since adding idle channels simply increases the bundle capacity by
a ﬁxed amount.
5.3 Bundling Performance
Using the RWTH data set, we evaluate the effectiveness of fre-
quency bundling by combining channels from the same services.
We divide an one-day trace into one-hour segments, randomly bun-
dle channels together, and simulate the three usage models on each
segment. As usual, we only consider channels with daily average
availability within [0.05,0.95], and assume a primary user disrup-
tion limit of η=0.1.
We evaluate frequency bundling by the resulting channel’s block-
ing time and extracted spectrum. In this case, the blocking time of
a frequency bundle is the duration where all the channels are busy

Improvement in Spectrum Availability
(c) Extracted Spectrum vs Availability
Figure 13: The performance of 2-channel frequency bundling from all the 15 services at the NED location. Redundancy experiences
the lowest blocking time, and Multiplexing enjoys the highest extracted spectrum. Yet for 70+% of bundles, Redundancy has similar
extracted spectrum as Multiplexing. This is because of (c) the non-linearity between the improvement in available spectrum and
those in effective spectrum availability.
or too risky to access. The extracted spectrum deﬁnes the amount
of spectrum used to send unique information. For Multiplexing,
this is the sum of those from each channel in the bundle, while for
Redundancy, it must discount periods where both channels simul-
taneously extract their spectrum (but use them to send the same
information).
2-Channel Bundling.
Figures 13(a)-(b) plot the cumulative dis-
tribution of secondary user’s blocking time and extracted spectrum
using 2-channel bundles. We compare the performance of Single-
channel, Switching, Redundancy and Multiplexing. The perfor-
mance of Single-channel is the mean of the two channels bundled
together. Figure 13(a) shows that Redundancy has the least block-
ing time by utilizing every available channel to avoid blockage. On
the other hand, Switching experiences 16+ seconds blocking time.
This is because Switching uses NKA due to lack of continuous
channel monitoring. With a 0.1 primary user disruption limit, in
average its users will be blocked by 90% of time, or a blocking time
of 9 ∗ 1.8 = 16.2s. On the other hand, if we extend Switching to
monitor each channel continuously, its performance will approach
that of Redundancy for the 2-channel case.
Figure 13(b) examines the actual spectrum extracted from these
bundles. As expected, Multiplexing extracts the largest amount
of spectrum by avoiding redundancy across channels. Yet sur-
prisingly, Redundancy performs similar to Multiplexing for 70%
of the bundles. This is due to the non-linear mapping between
spectrum available and spectrum extracted (discussed in Section 4,
Figure 9(c)). While Multiplexing improves the effective spectrum
availability, its improvement in the spectrum extracted is limited.
We conﬁrm this hypothesis in Figure 13(c), plotting the improve-
ment in extracted spectrum as a function of the improvement in
the effective spectrum availability. Even after adding 0.8 (or a raw
160KHz) to the effective availability, the actual extraction improve-
ment is only 20-30KHz.
Impact of Bundle Size.
Next we investigate how the perfor-
mance of frequency bundling scales with the size of the bundle.
Using the same pool of channels, we vary the bundle size k be-
tween 2 and 10, and measure the resulting secondary user blocking
time, service time as well as extracted spectrum. Results for the
Redundancy model in Figure 14 (a)-(c) show that bundling can ef-
fectively reduce blocking time and increase service time. In fact, a
linear increase in the bundling size k leads to one order of magni-
tude reduction in blocking time and improvement in service time.
As k increases beyond 5, the performance quickly converges be-
cause additional channels do not offer any new availability. These
results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency bundling.
The absolute values of average blocking and service times look
very promising. For the 6 services shown in this result, bundling
k=10 channels randomly creates a pseudo single channel that en-
joys in average a prolonged service time of 120–1300 seconds and
occasionally 2–4 seconds interruptions. These numbers are almost
two orders of magnitude better than the single channel performance.
Figure 14(d) plots extracted spectrum for various bundle sizes
using the Multiplexing model. Like the Redundancy model, the
spectrum extracted increases exponentially with bundle size. The
improvement is much higher than that of the redundancy model be-
cause multiplexing transmits different data on each channel to max-
imize spectrum utilization. Unlike the Redundancy model, how-
ever, the amount of usable spectrum varies across time depending
on the availability of each channel in the bundle.
5.4 Summary of Findings
Our analysis in this section leads to two key ﬁndings:
• In terms of their spectrum availability patterns, the majority
of frequency channel pairs in our dataset (200kHz in size)
display little correlation, unless they are adjacent in frequency.
• Frequency bundling can effectively build reliable and high
performance frequency channels from multiple unreliable chan-
nels. Even with random bundling, the improvement in sec-
ondary user’s service and blocking time scales exponentially
with the bundle size.
6.
IMPACT OF TIME GRANULARITY
Finally, we wish to understand the impact of the sweeping inter-
val in our conclusions. In particular, are the measurements sufﬁ-
ciently ﬁne grain to capture the variability in primary user access
patterns? If so, then secondary devices can improve their spec-
trum usage by simply sensing and accessing channels at a ﬁner time
granularity. If not, then what are the potential artifacts when sec-
ondary devices sense and access channels at a coarser granularity
than the variability in primary user access patterns?
We use the 2nd dataset (collected locally by us for this project)
to answer these questions. It only covers the GSM1900 downlink
