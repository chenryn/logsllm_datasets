To identify the pattern in the log, it appears that the `jk2_init()` function is unable to locate a specific child entry (in this case, with the ID 1566) within the scoreboard. The general pattern can be described as:

```
jk2_init() Can't find child <ID> in scoreboard
```

Where `<ID>` represents the identifier of the missing child entry. In the provided example, `<ID>` is 1566.
