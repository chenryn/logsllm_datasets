**ATT&CK Technique Name:** PowerShower

**Description:**
PowerShower adds a registry key to ensure that future instances of `powershell.exe` are launched with default window coordinates positioned off-screen. [33]

This technique helps adversaries to execute PowerShell scripts in a manner that is less likely to be noticed by the user, as the PowerShell window will not be visible on the screen.
