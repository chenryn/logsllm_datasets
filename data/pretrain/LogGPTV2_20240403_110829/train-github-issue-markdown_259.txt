In Symfony 2.7, the same `schemaLocation` is used as in previous versions:
```
http://symfony.com/schema/dic/services/services-1.0.xsd
```
However, this schema is outdated. The updated schema is now only available within the DependencyInjection component.

I recommend creating a new version, `services-1.1.xsd`, and publishing it under `symfony.com`. This will ensure that the latest schema is easily accessible and can be referenced correctly in future projects.
