ABSTRACT
Today, many e-commerce websites personalize their content,
including Netﬂix (movie recommendations), Amazon (prod-
uct suggestions), and Yelp (business reviews).
In many
cases, personalization provides advantages for users: for ex-
ample, when a user searches for an ambiguous query such as
“router,” Amazon may be able to suggest the woodworking
tool instead of the networking device. However, personaliza-
tion on e-commerce sites may also be used to the user’s dis-
advantage by manipulating the products shown (price steer-
ing) or by customizing the prices of products (price discrim-
ination). Unfortunately, today, we lack the tools and tech-
niques necessary to be able to detect such behavior.
In this paper, we make three contributions towards ad-
dressing this problem. First, we develop a methodology for
accurately measuring when price steering and discrimina-
tion occur and implement it for a variety of e-commerce web
sites. While it may seem conceptually simple to detect dif-
ferences between users’ results, accurately attributing these
diﬀerences to price discrimination and steering requires cor-
rectly addressing a number of sources of noise. Second, we
use the accounts and cookies of over 300 real-world users
to detect price steering and discrimination on 16 popular
e-commerce sites. We ﬁnd evidence for some form of per-
sonalization on nine of these e-commerce sites. Third, we
investigate the eﬀect of user behaviors on personalization.
We create fake accounts to simulate diﬀerent user features
including web browser/OS choice, owning an account, and
history of purchased or viewed products. Overall, we ﬁnd
numerous instances of price steering and discrimination on
a variety of top e-commerce sites.

INTRODUCTION
Personalization is a ubiquitous feature on today’s top web
destinations. Search engines such as Google, streaming-
media services such as Netﬂix, and recommendation sites
such as Yelp all use sophisticated algorithms to tailor con-
tent to each individual user. In many cases, personalization
provides advantages for users:
for example, when a user
searches on Google with an ambiguous query such as “apple,”
there are multiple potential interpretations. By personaliz-
ing the search results (e.g., by taking the user’s history of
prior searches into account), Google is able to return results
that are potentially more relevant (e.g., computer products,
rather than orchards).
Recently, researchers and Internet users have uncovered
evidence of personalization on e-commerce sites [1, 29, 30].
On such sites, the beneﬁts of personalization for users are
less clear; e-commerce sites have an economic incentive
to use personalization to induce users into spending more
money. For example, the travel website Orbitz was found
to be personalizing the results of hotel searches [28]. Unbe-
knownst to users, Orbitz “steered” Mac OS X users towards
more expensive hotels in select locations by placing them at
higher ranks in search results. Orbitz discontinued the use
of this personalization algorithm after one month [7].
At ﬁrst blush, detecting personalization on e-commerce
sites seems conceptually simple: have two users run the same
search, and any diﬀerences in the results indicate personal-
ization. Unfortunately, this approach is likely to have many
false positives, as diﬀerences between users’ results may exist
for a number of reasons not related to personalization. For
example, results may diﬀer due to changes in product inven-
tory, regional tax diﬀerences, or inconsistencies across data
centers. As a result, accurately detecting personalization on
e-commerce sites remains an open challenge.
305In this paper, we ﬁrst develop a methodology that can ac-
curately measure personalization on e-commerce sites. We
then use this methodology to address two questions: ﬁrst,
how widespread is personalization on today’s e-commerce
web sites? This includes price discrimination (customizing
prices for some users) as well as price steering (changing the
order of search results to highlight speciﬁc products). Sec-
ond, how are e-commerce retailers choosing to implement
personalization? Although there is anecdotal evidence of
these eﬀects [46, 48] and speciﬁc instances where retailers
have been exposed doing so [1, 28], the frequency and mech-
anisms of e-commerce personalization remain poorly under-
stood.
Our paper represents the ﬁrst comprehensive study of e-
commerce personalization that examines price discrimina-
tion and price steering for 300 real-world users1, as well as
synthetically generated fake accounts. We develop a mea-
surement infrastructure that is able to distinguish genuine
personalization of e-commerce sites from other sources of
noise; this methodology is based on previous work on mea-
suring personalization of web search services [17]. Using
this methodology, we examine 16 top e-commerce sites cov-
ering general retailers as well as hotel and rental car booking
sites. Our real-world data indicates that eight of these sites
implement personalization, while our controlled tests based
on fake accounts allow us to identify speciﬁc user features
that trigger personalization on seven sites. Speciﬁcally, we
observe the following personalization strategies:
• Cheaptickets and Orbitz implement price discrimina-
tion by oﬀering reduced prices on hotels to “members”.
• Expedia and Hotels.com engage in A/B testing that
steers a subset of users towards more expensive hotels.
• Home Depot and Travelocity personalize search results
• Priceline personalizes search results based on a user’s
for users on mobile devices.
history of clicks and purchases.
In addition to positively identifying price discrimination
and steering on several well-known e-commerce sites, we also
make the following four speciﬁc contributions. First, we in-
troduce control accounts into all of our experiments, which
allows us to diﬀerentiate between inherent noise and actual
personalization. Second, we develop a novel methodology us-
ing information retrieval metrics to identify price steering.
Third, we examine the impact of purchase history on per-
sonalization by reserving hotel rooms and rental cars, then
comparing the search results received by these users to users
with no history. Fourth, we identify a never-before-seen form
of e-commerce personalization based on A/B testing, and
show that it leads to price steering. Finally, we make all of
our crawling scripts, parsers, and raw data available to the
research community.
2. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
We now provide background on e-commerce personaliza-
tion and overview the terminology used in this paper.
2.1 A Brief History of Personalization
Online businesses have long used personalized recommen-
dations as a way to boost sales. Retailers like Amazon and

Target leverage the search and purchase histories of users
to identify products that users may be interested in.
In
some cases, companies go to great lengths to obfuscate the
fact that recommendations are personalized, because users
sometimes ﬁnd these practices to be creepy [10].
In several cases, e-commerce sites have been observed per-
forming price discrimination: the practice of showing diﬀer-
ent prices to diﬀerent people for the same item. Several years
ago, Amazon brieﬂy tested an algorithm that personalized
prices for frequent shoppers [1]. Although many consumers
erroneously believe that price discrimination on the Inter-
net is illegal and are against the practice [8, 36], consumers
routinely accept real-world price discrimination in the form
of coupons, student discounts, or members-only prices [5].
Similarly, e-commerce sites have been observed perform-
ing price steering: the practice of re-ordering search results
to place expensive items towards the top of the page. For ex-
ample, the travel web site Orbitz was found to be promoting
high-value hotels speciﬁcally to Apple users [28]. Although
the prices of individual items do not change in this case, cus-
tomers are likely to purchase items that are placed towards
the top of search results [25], and thus users can be nudged
towards more expensive items.
2.2 Scope of This Study
Throughout the paper, we survey a wide variety of e-
commerce web sites, ranging from large-scale retailers like
Walmart to travel sites like Expedia. To make the re-
sults comparable, we only consider products returned via
searches—as opposed to “departments”, home page oﬀers,
and other mechanisms by which e-commerce sites oﬀer prod-
ucts to users—as searching is a functionality supported by
most large retailers. We leave detecting price discrimination
and steering via other mechanisms to future work. Addi-
tionally, we use products and their advertised price on the
search result page (e.g., a speciﬁc item on Walmart or hotel
on Expedia) as the basic unit of measurement; we leave the
investigation of eﬀects such as bundle discounts, coupons,
sponsored listings, or hidden prices to future work as well.
2.3 Deﬁnitions
Personalization on web services comes in many forms (e.g.,
“localization”, per-account customization, etc.), and it is not
entirely straightforward to declare that an inconsistency be-
tween the product search results observed by two users is
due to personalization. For example, the two users’ search
queries may have been directed to diﬀerent data centers,
and the diﬀerences are a result of data center inconsistency
rather than intentional personalization.
For the purposes of this paper, we deﬁne personalization
to be taking place when an inconsistency in product search
results is due to client-side state associated with the request.
For example, a client’s request often includes tracking cook-
ies, a User-Agent identifying the browser and Operating Sys-
tem (OS), and the client’s source IP address. If any of these
lead to an inconsistency in the results, we declare the incon-
sistency to be personalization.
In the diﬀerent-datacenter
example from above, the inconsistency between the two re-
sults is not due to any client-side state, and we therefore
declare it not to be personalization.
More so than other web services [17], e-commerce retailers
have a number of diﬀerent dimensions available to personal-
306ize on. In this paper, we focus on two of the primary vectors
for e-commerce personalization:
Price steering occurs when two users receive diﬀerent
product results (or the same products in a diﬀerent order)
for the same query (e.g., Best Buy showing more-expensive
products to user A than user B when they both query for
“laptops”). Price steering can be similar to personalization
in web search [17], i.e., the e-commerce provider may be try-
ing to give the user more relevant products (or, they may
be trying to extract more money from the user). Steering is
possible because e-commerce sites often do not sort search
results by an objective metric like price or user reviews by
default; instead, results can be sorted using an ambiguous
metric like “Best Match” or “Most Relevant”.
Price discrimination occurs when two users are shown
inconsistent prices for the same product (e.g., Travelocity
showing a select user a higher price for a particular hotel).
Contrary to popular belief, price discrimination in general
is not illegal in the United States [13], as the Robinson–
Patman Act of 1936 (a.k.a. the Anti-Price Discrimination
Act) is written to control the behavior of product manu-
facturers and distributors, not consumer-facing enterprises.
It is unclear whether price discrimination targeted against
protected classes (e.g., race, religion, gender) is legal.
Although the term “price discrimination” evokes nega-
tive connotations, it is actually a fundamental concept in
economic theory, and it is widely practiced (and accepted
by consumers) in everyday life.
In economic theory, per-
fect price discrimination refers to a pricing strategy where
each consumer is charged the maximum amount that they
are willing to pay for each item [37]. Elastic consumers
can aﬀord to pay higher prices, whereas inelastic (price-
constrained) consumers are charged less. In practice, strate-
gies like direct and indirect segmentation are employed by
companies to charge diﬀerent prices to diﬀerent segments of
consumers [32]. One classic (and extremely popular [5]) ex-
ample of indirect segmentation is coupons: consumers that
take the time to seek out and use coupons explicitly reveal
to the retailer that they are price-inelastic. Another ac-
cepted form of indirect segmentation is Saturday-night stay
discount for airfares. Accepted forms of direct segmentation
include discounts for students and seniors.
3. METHODOLOGY
Both price steering and discrimination are diﬃcult to re-
liably detect in practice, as diﬀerences in e-commerce search
results across users may be due to factors other than person-
alization. In this section, we describe the methodology we
develop to address these measurement challenges. First, we
give the high-level intuition that guides the design of our ex-
periments, and describe how we accurately distinguish per-
sonalization of product search results from other causes of
inconsistency. Second, we describe the implementation of
our experiments. Third, we detail the sites that we choose
to study and the queries we select to test for personalization.
3.1 Measuring Personalization
The ﬁrst challenge we face when trying to measure per-
sonalization on e-commerce sites is dealing with the variety
of sites that exist. Few of these sites oﬀer programmatic
APIs, and each uses substantially diﬀerent HTML markup
to implement their site. As a result, we collect data by visit-
ing the various sites’ web pages, and we write custom HTML
parsers to extract the products and prices from the search re-
