## Abstract
E-commerce websites frequently personalize content, such as product recommendations, to enhance user experience. While personalization can be beneficial, it may also disadvantage users through price steering (manipulating the order of search results) or price discrimination (customizing product prices). Currently, there are no robust methods to detect these practices. This paper addresses this issue by developing a methodology for accurately measuring price steering and discrimination across various e-commerce platforms. We use the accounts and cookies of over 300 real-world users to detect these practices on 16 popular e-commerce sites, finding evidence of personalization on nine of them. Additionally, we investigate the impact of user behaviors on personalization by simulating different user features, such as web browser/OS choice, account ownership, and purchase history. Our findings reveal numerous instances of price steering and discrimination on top e-commerce sites.

## 1. Introduction
Personalization is a common feature on major web platforms, including search engines like Google, streaming services like Netflix, and recommendation sites like Yelp. These platforms use sophisticated algorithms to tailor content to individual users, often enhancing the user experience. For example, Google personalizes search results based on a user's search history, potentially returning more relevant results.

However, recent research and user reports have uncovered evidence of personalization on e-commerce sites, where the benefits to users are less clear. E-commerce sites may use personalization to increase sales, sometimes at the expense of the user. For instance, Orbitz was found to steer Mac OS X users towards more expensive hotels, a practice they discontinued after one month.

Detecting personalization on e-commerce sites is challenging due to potential false positives from factors like inventory changes, regional tax differences, or data center inconsistencies. This paper develops a methodology to accurately measure personalization on e-commerce sites, focusing on price discrimination and price steering. We use this methodology to study 16 top e-commerce sites, examining both real-world and synthetic user accounts. Our findings indicate that eight of these sites implement personalization, and we identify specific user features that trigger personalization on seven sites.

## 2. Background and Motivation
### 2.1 A Brief History of Personalization
Online businesses have long used personalized recommendations to boost sales. Retailers like Amazon and Target use user search and purchase histories to suggest products. However, some companies obscure the fact that recommendations are personalized, as users may find it unsettling.

E-commerce sites have been observed engaging in price discrimination, showing different prices for the same item to different users. For example, Amazon briefly tested an algorithm that personalized prices for frequent shoppers. Although many consumers believe price discrimination is illegal, it is widely accepted in forms like coupons, student discounts, and members-only prices.

Similarly, e-commerce sites have practiced price steering, reordering search results to highlight expensive items. For example, Orbitz promoted high-value hotels to Apple users. While individual prices do not change, users are more likely to purchase items at the top of search results, leading to higher overall spending.

### 2.2 Scope of This Study
This study examines a variety of e-commerce sites, from large retailers like Walmart to travel sites like Expedia. We focus on products returned via searches, as searching is a common functionality across most large retailers. We leave the detection of price discrimination and steering via other mechanisms for future work. We also use the advertised price on the search result page as the basic unit of measurement, deferring the investigation of bundle discounts, coupons, sponsored listings, and hidden prices to future studies.

### 2.3 Definitions
Personalization on web services can take many forms, and it is not always straightforward to determine if inconsistencies in search results are due to personalization. For this paper, we define personalization as occurring when an inconsistency in product search results is due to client-side state, such as tracking cookies, User-Agent strings, or IP addresses.

We focus on two primary vectors of e-commerce personalization:
- **Price Steering**: When two users receive different product results or the same products in a different order for the same query.
- **Price Discrimination**: When two users are shown inconsistent prices for the same product.

While price discrimination has negative connotations, it is a fundamental concept in economic theory and is widely practiced and accepted in everyday life, such as through coupons and student discounts.

## 3. Methodology
### 3.1 Measuring Personalization
Measuring personalization on e-commerce sites is challenging due to the variety of sites and their lack of programmatic APIs. We collect data by visiting the sites' web pages and writing custom HTML parsers to extract products and prices from search results. We address the following challenges:

1. **High-Level Intuition**: We design experiments to distinguish personalization from other causes of inconsistency.
2. **Implementation**: We describe the implementation of our experiments.
3. **Site Selection and Queries**: We detail the sites and queries chosen for testing personalization.

By using control accounts and information retrieval metrics, we differentiate between inherent noise and actual personalization. We also examine the impact of purchase history on personalization by reserving hotel rooms and rental cars and comparing the search results received by these users to those with no history. Additionally, we identify a new form of e-commerce personalization based on A/B testing, which leads to price steering. All our crawling scripts, parsers, and raw data are available to the research community.
