likely very interesting in gaining access the the domain controller with Administrator-privileges. That
means you control the network.
Since you authenticate against a domain controller you can log in to your account from any of the
machines in the network. Think of systems you have had in schools and universities, where you can
just sit down by any computer and log in to your account. This is usually a domain type network.
In order to set up a Domain network you need at least one Windows server for the domain controller.
If you have hacked a machine and you want to know if it is part of either a Workgroup or a domain
you can do the following: go to Control panel/System. If it says Workgroup:
something it means that the machine is connected to a workgroup, and not a domain.
Active directory
From Windows 2000 and on the application Active directory has been program used for maintaining
the central database of users and configurations.
Domain controller
Any windows computer can be configured to be a domain controller. The domain controller manages
all the security aspects of the interaction between user and domain. There are usually a least two
computers configured to be domain-controllers. In case one breaks down.
If you have compromised a machine that belong to a domain you can check if it has any users. DC:s
don't have local users.
If you run enum4linux you can look out for this section

Basics of Windows
 -  B  Domain Controllers
A third way is to run this command
echo %logonserver%
SMB
On networks that are based on Linux and you need to integrate a windows machine you can use SMB
to do that.
Kerberos
Kerberos is a network authentication protocol. The original protocol is used by many unix-systems.
Windows have their own version of the Kerberos protocol, so that it works with their NT-kernel. It is
used by windows Domains to authenticate users. But kerberos can also be found in several unix-
operating systems. Kerberos was not built by windows, but long before.
I think a machine that has port 88 open (the default kerberos port) can be assumed to be a Domain
Controller.
When a user logs in to the domain Active Directory uses Kerberos to authenticate the user. When the
user insert her password it gets one-way encrypted and sent with Kerberos to the Active directory,
which then compares it with its password database. The Key Distribution Center responds with a TGI
ticket to the user machine.
Workgroup
A workgroup architecture stands in contrast to the domain-system. A workgroup is based on the idea
of peer-to-peer and not server-client as domain is. In a domain network you have a server (domain
controller) and a client (the user). Therefore it might be a bit hard to control a network bigger than a
dozen clients. So it is usually used for smaller networks. If a computer is part of a workgroup it
cannot be part of a domain. In a workgroup architecture each computer is in charge of its own security
settings. So there is no single computer in charge of all the security settings for the workgroup. This is
good because you don't have one single point of failure, bt is also bad because you have to trust the
users to configure their machines securely.
In a network you can have several workgroups. But that is usually not the case.
In a workgroup users can see each other, and share files.
User privileges
How does the user-system work on windows.
System (user)
System is actually not a user per se. System is technically a security principle. One big difference
between System and Administrator is that is the computer is connected to a domain the system user
can access the domain in the context of the domain account. The administrator cannot.
On windows it is possible to grant permission of a file to System but not to Administrator.
One example of this is the SAM key, which contains local account information. The System user has
42
Basics of Windows
access to this information, but the Administrator does not.
http://superuser.com/questions/504136/root-vs-administrator-vs-system
Administrator
Administrator is a default account on Windows. It is the user with the highest privileges.
Normal user
The normal user obviously have less privileges than the Administrator.
You can add a new user through the cmd with the following command:
net user username /add
net user kalle secret_password123 /add
# Add user to administrator group - thus making it administrator
net localgroup administrators kalle /add
# Add to Remote Desktop User

Structure of windows
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_structure
Windows 7
The root folder of windows c:\ by default contains the following
Windows
Users
Registry
You often hear talk about the registry when talking about Windows. But what is really the registry?
Well the windows registry is a hierarchical database that stores low-level settings used by the OS or
any other application that uses it. The SAM (Security account manager) uses it, along with a lot of
other stuff.
There is not really any equivalent for the Registry in Linux. Most configurations are done in text-files
in Linux.You can usually find the under /etc.
Edit the registry
In Linux you usually just sudo-edit a config-file in /etc. In Windows you open Regedit and you can
see the whole hierarchy. The registry is built with Key-value pairs.
SAM
Drivers
43
Basics of Windows
You hear a lot of talk about drivers in the Windows ecosystem, but not in Linux. That is because in
Linux the drivers are open-sourced and included in the kernel, for most part. These drivers might be
produced by nice programmers or they could be developed by the hardware-producer themselves.
That's why it is so easy and fast to install new hardware on Linux. If it is compatible that is. Drivers
are software lets the OS communicate with the hardware. Like networks cards, graphics card, printers.
To list all the drivers on the machine use the following command:
driverquery
This can we good to know since drivers can contains vulnerabilities that can be used for priv-esc.
Check out the chapter on that.
IIS - Windows web server
IIS stands for Internet Information Services (before it was Internet Information Server).
The software is usually includede in most Windows versions, except for the home editions. The IIS
version usually corresponds to the OS version. There is a new IIS version for every new OS, in
general.
By default IIS 5.1 and earlier run websites in a single process running the context of the System
account
ASP
Activ server pages is the scripting environment for IIS. ASP render the content on the server side. The
scripting languages that are supported are: VBScript, JScript and PerlScript.
Important files and stuff
SAM key
File types
In windows file-ending are important.
BAT
.bat-files are the windows equivalent to bash-scripts
In order to write a batch-script you open up an editor and then just write your commands. And then
you save it as blabla.bat. And make sure you don't save it as a text file.
Then you just run the script from the cmd
DLL - Dynamic Link Library
A DLL file is a library that is used for one or more program. It is a binary-file but it is not executable
in itself, but it contains code that the executable calls. It is used to modularize the code of a program.
In the windows operating system DLL files are shared among different applications. For example, the
dll Comdlg32 is used to create dialog boxes. So different applications can invoke this library to
easily create a dialog box. This promotes code reuse.
44
Basics of Windows
So an application may use the standard windows DLL-files, but it may also bring its own DLL-files.
So if one DLL-file is missing for a program a certain module might not work. As most Windows-
users have sometime experienced.
LIB
Lib is a bit like DLL, it is a library. But it is not dynamic as DLL. So lib-files are linked on compile-
time. While dll-files are linked in run-time. Since lib-files are compiled into the executable you never
see it (unless you are developing of course). But since DLL-files are dynamically loaded at run-time
they are still around for the user to see.

PowerShell
PowerShell
PowerShell
PowerShell is Windows new shell. It comes by default from Windows 7. But can be downloaded and
installed in earlier versions.
PowerShell provides access to almost everything an attacker might want.
It is based on the .NET framework.
It is basically bash for windows
The commands are case-insensitive
Basics
So a command in PowerShell is called cmdlet. The cmdlets are created using a verb and a noun. Like
Get-Command, Get is a verb and Command is a noun. Other verbs can be: remove, set, disable,
install, etc.
To get help on how to use a cmdlet while in PowerShell, the man-page, you do:
Get-Help 
Example
get-help echo
get-help get-command
Powershell Version and Build
$PSVersionTable
Fundamentals
With get-member you can list all the properties and methods of the object that the command returns.
Get-Member
For example:
Get-Command | Get-Member
Get-Process | Get-Member
Select-XXX
Select-object
Variables
$testVar = "blabla"
Wget / Download a file
Invoke-WebRequest 
46
PowerShell
wget 
Grep
Select string can be used like grep
get-command | select-string blabla
General commands that can be used on objects
measure-object -words
get-content fil.txt | measure-object words
Working with filesystem
List all files in current directory
get-childitem
gci
List hidden files too
gci -Force
List all files recurisvely
gci -rec
Count the files
(get-childitem).count
List all files but exclude some folders
gci -exclude AppData | gci -rec -force
Working with files
Read a file
Get-Content
gc
cat
Count lines of file
(get-content .\file).count
Select specific line in a file (remember that it starts from 0)
(gc .\file.txt)[10]
gc .\file.txt | Select -index 10
Services
List services
get-service

To see a list of all properties do this
get-adcomputer ComputerName -prop *
Get AD Users
Get-ADUser -f {Name -eq 'Karl, Martinez'} -properties *
Get all AD Groups
Get-ADGroup -filter *

PowerShell Scripting

Powershell scripting
Variables
Variables are declared like this
$test = "something"
Execute scripts
So for security reasons the default policy for executing scripts is Restricted. Here are the different
script-policies.
Restricted: PowerShell won't run any scripts. This is PowerShell's default execution policy.
AllSigned: PowerShell will only run scripts that are signed with a digital signature. If you run a script
signed by a publisher PowerShell hasn't seen before, PowerShell will ask whether you trust the
script's publisher.
RemoteSigned: PowerShell won't run scripts downloaded from the Internet unless they have a digital
signature, but scripts not downloaded from the Internet will run without prompting. If a script has a
digital signature, PowerShell will prompt you before it runs a script from a publisher it hasn't seen
before.
Unrestricted: PowerShell ignores digital signatures but will still prompt you before running a script
downloaded from the Internet.
Source: http://windowsitpro.com/powershell/running-powershell-scripts-easy-1-2-3
So if we want to run script myscript.ps1 we have to set the execution-policy. First let's check
what execution-policy we currently have:
Get-ExecutionPolicy
Then we can set the execution policy like this
set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted

Mounting - Mapping
In the windows world mounting is called mapping.
If you want to see which drives are mapped/mounted to your file-system you can use any of these
commands:
51
CMD
# This is the most thorough
wmic logicaldisk get deviceid, volumename, description
# But this works too
wmic logicaldisk get name
wmic logicaldisk get caption
# This can be slow. So don't kill your shell!
fsutil fsinfo drives
# With powershell
get-psdrive -psprovider filesystem
# This works too, but it is interacive. So it might be dangerous work hackers
diskpart
list volume
# Map only network drives
net use
The command to deal with mounting/mapping is net use
Using net use we can connect to other shared folder, on other systems. Many windows machines
have a default-share called IPC (Interprocess communication share). It does not contain any files. But
we can usually connect to it without authentication. This is called a null-session. Although the share
does not contain any files it contains a lot of data that is useful for enumeration. The Linux-equivalent
of net use is usually smbclient.
net use \\IP address\IPC$ "" /u:""
net use \\192.168.1.101\IPC$ "" /u:""
If you want to map a drive from another network to your filesystem you can do that like this:
# This will map it to drive z
net use z: \\192.168.1.101\SYSVOL
# This will map it to the first available drive-letter
net use * \\192.168.1.101\SYSVOL
Here you map the drive to the letter z. If the command is successful you should now be able to access
