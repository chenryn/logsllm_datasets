Forms frequently utilize `GlobalKey` to access `FormState` and `FormFieldState` for saving or validating data. However, this approach is more resource-intensive than necessary. What we actually need is a simpler way to retrieve the `State` object of a widget. The `GlobalKey` comes with additional overhead that is not always required.

For example, consider the following implementation, which would be sufficient for our needs:

```dart
class StateKey<T extends StatefulWidget> extends Key {
  // Called when the Element is mounted.
  void _register(Element element) {
    currentElement = element;
  }

  StatefulElement? currentElement;

  T? get currentState => currentElement?.state as T?;
}
```

This custom `StateKey` class provides a more lightweight solution by directly accessing the `State` object of the associated widget, without the extra baggage of `GlobalKey`.
