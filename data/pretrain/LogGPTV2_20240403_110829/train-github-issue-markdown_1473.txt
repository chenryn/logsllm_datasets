Forms make heavy use of GlobalKeys for getting access to the FormState and
FormFieldState in order to save or validate. This is more expensive than it
needs to be. All we really want is a way to grab the State object of a widget.
GlobalKey comes with extra baggage.
See this example and this comment.
Something like this would be sufficient:
    class StateKey> extends Key {
      // Called when Element is mounted.
      void _register(Element element) {
        currentElement = element;
      }
      StatefulElement currentElement;
      T get currentState => currentElement?.state;
    }
