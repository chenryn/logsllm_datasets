User: Hey all, Linux has a lot of great features in procfs and sysfs, and tools like vmstat extend that quite a bit, but I have a need to collect data from a variety of these systems and was hoping to leverage a unified Python utility instead of hacking together a bunch of disparate scripts.
In order to do that I first need to identify whether or not Python has the bits and pieces I need to adequately parse/process the different data collection points. So, the essence of my question:
Is there a python module that handles/parses the sysfs objects already?
I've looked for such a beast via Google, usenet, and various forums, but I haven't yet found anything intelligent or functional.  So, before I carve one out, I figured I'd check here first.
Assistant: Not really sure why you need something specific, they are all text files for the most part, you can just mess with them directly.
There aren't any python modules that does that as far as I know.
