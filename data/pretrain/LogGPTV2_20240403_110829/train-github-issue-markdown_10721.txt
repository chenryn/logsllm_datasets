When using next.js app in production mode with assets hosted on static (or not
next.js powered) CDN it breaks when user navigates to non-existing page.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Expected behavior to do full page "refresh" to allow integration between
next.js powered pages other web pages on internet.
## Current Behavior
It renders unexpected error page:  
![unexpected
error](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/50a5aa43ac59d940c76911b8bcb7796f92cc18508eebddc0aa4f7406becaf980/687474703a2f2f69612e67732f3258323430453331316730452f496d616765253230323031382d30322d3230253230617425323031312e35392e3435253230414d2e706e67)
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I created example repo: https://github.com/alexindigo/next-ab
## Context
It doesn't allow us to integrate new next.js powered pages with the existing
website.
