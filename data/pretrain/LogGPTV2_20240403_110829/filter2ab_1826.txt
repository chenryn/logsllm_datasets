**ATT&CK ID:** T1070.007  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Clear Network Connection History and Configurations

**Description:**

Adversaries may clear or remove evidence of malicious network connections to eliminate traces of their activities. Network connections, particularly those involving remote services or external remote services, often generate configuration settings and various artifacts that highlight connection history on the system. These artifacts can be used by defenders to monitor and analyze network connections created by adversaries. By clearing these records, attackers aim to evade detection and hinder forensic analysis.
