### Performance of a Radiating Device

The radiating device under consideration has an output power of 100 mW and an antenna gain of 6 dBi, resulting in a maximum radiated power of 1 mW. The DTV receiver is assumed to have a 0-dBi gain. Appendix 2 provides all the relations and procedures used, along with the assumptions made to perform the calculations for interference distance.

#### Interference Distance Calculation
To determine the interference distance from this radiating device to a DTV receiver, we need to calculate the power level at which the DTV receiver is affected by the radiating device. This involves increasing the power of the radiating device until the DTV receiver reaches the threshold of visibility (TOV).

- **Power Level**: The radiating device's power is increased in dB.
- **Desired Signal Level**: The DTV receiver is set to -68 dBm.
- **Undesired Signals**:
  - U1: N+3 (Channel 46)
  - U2: N-3 (Channel 40)

The tables above summarize the test conditions and results for the interference distance calculation. The degradation and interference distances are calculated based on the presence of multiple undesired signals and their impact on the DTV receiver. These values are essential for understanding the performance and potential interference of the radiating device.
