User: I have installed Py-Appscript on my machine and it can be used with the Python installation at /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python.
I am trying to use this installation of Py-Appscript with an Automator service. To do this, I use the Run Shell Script action and then set the Shell to usr/bin/python (which is my only choice for Python, unfortunately).
The usr/bin/python does not appear to have access to my third-party modules and crashes on the line:
from appscript import *
Is there a way for me to give usr/bin/python access to my third-party modules?
OR
Is there a way to tell Automator to use /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python instead?
I need Automator to run the Python directly from the Run Shell Script action. Any action that calls Python scripts that are external to Automator (via bin/bash, for example) does not perform quickly enough to be useful.
Assistant: When you install modules, you typically install them per Python instance. So in this case you have installed them for the Python in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/python, and it will then be available only for that Python. /usr/bin/python is then apparently another Python installation (I'm not an OS X expert).
To make it available for the /usr/bin/python installation, install it for /usr/bin/python.
