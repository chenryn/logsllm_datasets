Hey,
had to describe the issue in one line, here is the possibiltiy to reproduce
    DELETE campaigns
    PUT campaigns
    {
       "mappings" : {
          "campaign" : {
             "properties" : {
                "location" : {
                    "type": "geo_shape",
                    "tree": "quadtree"
                }
             }
          }
       }
    }
    POST /campaigns/campaign/1
    {
      "location" : {
          "type" : "circle",
          "coordinates" : [45.01, 2.26],
          "radius" : "9000m"
      }
    }
    POST campaigns/campaign/
    {
      "_id": { "c_id": "1891"},
      "location" : {
          "type" : "circle",
          "coordinates" : [45.01, 2.26],
          "radius" : "9000m"
      }
    }
    GET campaigns/campaign/_search
    GET campaigns/campaign/_search
    {
        "query":{
            "filtered": {
                "query": {
                    "match_all": {}
                },
                "filter": {
                    "geo_shape": {
                        "location": {
                       "relation": "intersects",
                            "shape": {
                                "type": "circle",
                                "coordinates" : [45.01001, 2.26],
                                "radius":"1m"
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
You can see the difference between match all and the geo shape query, even
though the points are the same. If you remove the `_id` field from the
document, everything works, so maybe the IdFieldMapper throws an Exception
(rightfully, as an id cannot be an object) and then the rest of the document
is not indexed.
If you replace the `_id` object with a string, you get an exception, that the
id values dont match as one ID is autogenerated. Not sure, if this is the
desired behaviour.
