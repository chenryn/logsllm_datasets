**ATT&CK ID:** G0087  
**Technique Name:** APT39

APT39 has been known to use malware to disable the "RequireSigned" feature in Windows. This feature ensures that only digitally signed DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) are allowed to run, thereby enhancing system security. By disabling this feature, APT39 can execute unsigned and potentially malicious DLLs on the targeted system.
