User: I want to have an application writing out information at the same time that a monitor is reading it. The application is "embedded" (and on Win32 XP) and so has restricted memory and I/O functionality.
The simplest way I can think to do this is by writing the data to a buffer file from the application, and then read the same file using the monitor application. The writer application is C++, and the reader is currently Python on Win32 XP.
Are there libraries to do this? Has anyone seen examples of this?
I don't want to have to use a database as I don't want to link to a database library in the applcation. I.e. don't have space and may not be supported on the embedded platform.
Another way to do this is over a network connection, but I figure files are the simplest solution.
Assistant: You can use memory-mapped files, standard Python module called mmap.
