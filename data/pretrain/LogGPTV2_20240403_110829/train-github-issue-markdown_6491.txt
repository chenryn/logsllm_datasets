# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19041.264]
    PowerToys version: v0.18.1
    PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): FancyZones
# Steps to reproduce / Actual behavior
  * deselect "Override Windows Snap hotkeys"
  * "snap" a window from maximized to left/right to max again, end in "maxed"

  * select "Override Windows Snap hotkeys"
  * "snap" the same window from max, one cannot go left/right in the same way, one must first `Win-Down` to unmaximize it, _then_ one can shift between zones

(top row keypresses are effectively no-ops)
# Expected behavior
To more closely mimic the behavior of normal (non-FancyZones) windows snap
hotkeys, I expect them to be able to cycle out of maximized explicitly. When
the FancyZones snap hotkey `Win-Left` is called on a maximized window, there
is no ambiguity on what the user is trying to do.

(This is a 'tweener between bug and feature-request: while it isn't crashing,
its behavior to mimic basic windows hotkey snap behavior is
incomplete/different, seemingly unnecessarily.)
