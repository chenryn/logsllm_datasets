User: How do I change file extensions in windows 8? I tried and my system will not recognize the change.
I tried changing from .txt to .py for python so i can use in IDLE.
Assistant: I created a file called myfile.txt. It showed up in Explorer as myfile.txt. If you just see myfile (no extension), then go to Folder Options, Advanced, and uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types".
I Right-clicked myfile.txt, selected Rename, and Windows selected just "myfile", not ".txt". I changed the selection to "txt", overwrote it with "py" and hit enter. Windows popped up a message warning that I was changing the extension. I clicked OK and the file was renamed.
An alternate approach is to open a command prompt, cd to the directory and use "move" to change the name.
Yet another option, if you are doing this from a text editor, click "Save As", change the save dialog's "Save As Type" drop-down to All Files, change the name to .py and hit OK. You end up with a .txt and a .py.
