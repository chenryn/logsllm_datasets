**How to Change File Extensions in Windows 8**

If you are having trouble changing a file extension, such as from `.txt` to `.py`, follow these steps to ensure the process is completed correctly. This will allow you to use the file in IDLE or any other Python environment.

### Method 1: Using File Explorer

1. **Ensure File Extensions Are Visible:**
   - Open **File Explorer**.
   - Go to the **View** tab and check the box for **File name extensions**. If you don't see this option, go to **Folder Options** (or **Folder and Search Options**), then to the **View** tab, and uncheck **Hide extensions for known file types**.

2. **Rename the File:**
   - Locate the file you want to rename (e.g., `myfile.txt`).
   - Right-click on the file and select **Rename**.
   - The current file name (e.g., `myfile`) will be highlighted. Delete the `.txt` extension and type `.py`.
   - Press **Enter**. Windows may display a warning message about changing the file extension. Click **OK** to proceed.

### Method 2: Using Command Prompt

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Enter** to open the Command Prompt.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your file is located. For example:
     ```sh
     cd C:\path\to\your\directory
     ```

3. **Rename the File:**
   - Use the `move` command to change the file extension. For example:
     ```sh
     move myfile.txt myfile.py
     ```

### Method 3: Using a Text Editor

1. **Open the File in a Text Editor:**
   - Open the file (e.g., `myfile.txt`) in a text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, or any other editor you prefer.

2. **Save As with a New Extension:**
   - Go to **File** > **Save As**.
   - In the **Save As** dialog box, change the **Save as type** dropdown to **All Files**.
   - Enter the new file name with the desired extension (e.g., `myfile.py`).
   - Click **Save**. This will create a new file with the `.py` extension.

By following these methods, you should be able to successfully change the file extension and use the file in IDLE or any other Python environment.
