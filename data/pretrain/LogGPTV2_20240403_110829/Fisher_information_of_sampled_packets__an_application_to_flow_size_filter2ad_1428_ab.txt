per ﬂow, the distribution (cid:2)θ
conditioned on the SYN sam-
pled ﬂows is the same as the original ﬂow size distribution (cid:2)θ.
We refer to a TCP sampled ﬂow with a SYN sampled packet
as SYN sampled ﬂow. Assume there are n sampled ﬂows.
(n)
We use ˆd
(S,m) to denote the fraction of the n sampled ﬂows
where a SYN packet is sampled and there are m sampled
(n)
packets. Likewise, we denote by ˆd
(N,m) the fraction of the n
sampled ﬂows where there was no SYN sampled packet and
there are m sampled packets in total. For now we focus on
TCP SYN sampled ﬂows, and ignore ﬂows without a sam-
pled SYN. In Section 4.3 we show how to add ﬂows sampled
without SYNs to the estimator. Equation (3) holds for SYN
sampled ﬂows with matrix B properly redeﬁned. The modi-
ﬁcation to B is found in [3]. We refer an estimator that uses
(n)
ˆd
(S,m) as a “SYN-pktct” estimator.
Next we turn our attention to sequence numbers.
Samples with TCP sequence numbers. TCP uses
a 32-bit sequence number that counts payload bytes in a
ﬂow. Assume that the TCP start sequence number, i.e., the
starting byte count of the sampled packets, is available. An
estimator that measures ﬂow sizes in number of bytes can
clearly beneﬁt from TCP sequence numbers. The question
is whether an estimator using packet counts can also beneﬁt
from sequence numbers. We assume that there is a function
h(sa, sb) that takes two TCP sequence numbers sa and sb
from two distinct packets a and b of the same ﬂow and re-
turns the number of packets sent between a and b including
a and b. We acknowledge that it is not easy to construct a
function h that returns the exact packet counts. In Section 5
we provide a reasonably good approximation to h.
Let s
(u)
min, s
(u)
max be the smallest/greatest sampled TCP
sequence number values of ﬂow u (wrap around is easily
(n)
treated). Let U be a set of sampled SYN ﬂows and let ˆd
r
(u)
be the fraction of sampled SYN ﬂows with r = h(s
min),
∀u ∈ U . This new sample deﬁnition induces a new ma-
trix B with bi,(S,r) = p(1 − p)i−r, ∀i ≤ W, 2 ≤ r ≤ i and
bi,(S,1) = (1 − p)i−1, and the rest of the matrix being zero.
(n)
Finally, denote an estimator that uses ˆd
(S,r) as a “SYN-seq”
estimator.
(u)
max, s
Samples with TCP sequence numbers and full SYN
ﬂag information. Our traces show that only 20% of the
TCP sampled ﬂows contain a SYN sampled packet. In [3]
the authors conjecture that there are few SYN sampled ﬂows
which implies less accurate estimates. Next we increase the
number samples by adding sampled ﬂows without a SYN
sampled packet to the estimator.
Denote the estimator that uses TCP sequence numbers
and SYN ﬂags (SYNs and non SYN sampled ﬂows) as a
“ALL-seq-sﬂag” estimator. Let B denote the sampling prob-
ability matrix as deﬁned by (3). Let j denote a tuple (SYNFLAG, r),
(u)
(u)
where r = h(s
max, s
min). Let SYNFLAG = S when there
is a SYN packet in the sampled ﬂow and SYNFLAG = N
i, = p (1 − p)i−r and b
(cid:2)
(cid:2)
otherwise. Thus b
i, =
(i − r) p (1 − p)i−r. The element i, j of matrix B is bi,j =

We have introduced several types of information. One
question that remains is which type of information is valu-
able to an estimator. The next section is devoted to quan-
tifying the impact of these types of information on the esti-
mation accuracy of (cid:2)θ.

α is also known as the likelihood function. The likelihood
function α can be extended to α(n), the likelihood of n inde-
pendently sampled ﬂows. The parameters (cid:2)θ of the likelihood
function α are constrained by:X

Unfortunately the Fisher information as deﬁned in [2] is
unconstrained. But constraints (7) can be included by a
simple change of variables in α:

θi = β(γi) =

with γi ∈ R. Function β maps γi with domain R to (0, 1),

thus satisfying constraints (7). Furthermore, deﬁne a func-
∀i β(γi) − 1. Then g((cid:2)γ) = 0 iﬀ constraint (6)
tion g((cid:2)γ) =
is satisﬁed. Take (cid:2)γ ∈ D, where D = {(cid:2)γ|g((cid:2)γ) = 0} and β((cid:2)γ),
a vector whose i-th element is β(γi), then the likelihood
function f of one sampled ﬂow is

Under the above conditions we ﬁnd the Fisher information

ˆ(cid:2)d (1); (cid:2)γ)/∂γi. We use
a vector whose i-th element is ∂ ln f (
the main result of [8] to also include constraint (6). Note

that dj is equal to P ( ˆd

From now on we omit the dependence of J and G on (cid:2)γ for
notational convenience. Let I be the Fisher information of
f ( (cid:2)d (1); (cid:2)γ). We obtain I from its inverse I−1. The inverse
of the Fisher information with (cid:2)γ ∈ D, I−1((cid:2)γ) , is a W × W

The Fisher information can be used to compute a lower
bound on the mean squared error of any unbiased estimator
of (cid:2)θ as seen next.
3.2 The Cram´er-Rao bound
The Cram´er-Rao theorem states that the mean squared
error of any unbiased estimator is lower bounded by the in-
P
verse of the Fisher information [8], provided some regularity
conditions required by the Cram´er-Rao bound. These regu-
larity condition [10] translates into
∀i on the ﬂow size estimation problem, which clearly holds.
Let ˜γi be an unbiased estimate of γi. Combining the
j ∂dj/∂γi = ∂/∂γi
P
j dj,
Cram´er-Rao theorem with Lemma 3.1 gives
E[(γi − ˜γi)

or, more generally
with I−1 as deﬁned in (11).
E[((cid:2)γ − ˜(cid:2)γ)((cid:2)γ − ˜(cid:2)γ)

] ≥ −I−1
/n,
(12)
The mean squared error obtained from (12) is a function
of parameters (cid:2)γ. We would like to ﬁnd the mean square
error with respect to (cid:2)θ.
The mean squared error of (cid:2)θ follows by applying the delta
method [16]: Let n be a large number of sampled ﬂows.

Table 2: Number of sampled ﬂows an unbiased esti-
mator needs in order to achieve standard deviation
error of 0.1 for ﬂows of size one. Results for max-
imum ﬂow size W = 20 and sampling rate p = 1/200
over the BB-East-1 trace ﬂow size distribution.
Although n is assumed to be a large number, it can still be
considered small on the scale of a Tier-1 Internet backbone.

Let H = [hi,j] with hi,j = β(γj)/∂γi and likewise H

where h
i,j = ∂gi(β((cid:2)γ))/∂γj, with gi, i, j as deﬁned by (1).

a function of (cid:2)θ, the mean squared error of the estimate of

3.3 Applying the Cram´er-Rao bound
We illustrate the application of the Cram´er-Rao bound
with two examples. The ﬁrst one in Section 3.3.1 shows all
of the necessary steps to obtain the Cram´er-Rao bound. The
second one in Section 3.3.2 displays the use of the Fisher
Information through the Cram´er-Rao bound, in designing
better estimators.
In the next two examples we will look
at SYN sampled ﬂows. The parameters of the following
two examples are just to illustrate the use of the Fisher
information. On Section 4 we will look at more realistic
scenarios.
3.3.1 Example with maximum ﬂow size of two
Let W = 2 be the maximum ﬂow size. Let θ1 = 0.88 and
