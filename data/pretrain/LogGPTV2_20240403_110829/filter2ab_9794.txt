### ATT&CK Technique Details

**ATT&CK ID:** T1574.011  
**Technique Name:** Service Registry Permissions Weakness

**Description:**

Adversaries may exploit weak permissions on service-related registry entries to execute their own malicious payloads. By hijacking the registry keys associated with services, attackers can redirect the execution of a legitimate service to a malicious executable under their control. This allows them to launch their code when the service starts.

Windows stores local service configuration information in the registry, specifically under the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services` key. The data stored in these keys, such as the path to the executable, can be manipulated to change the service's execution parameters. Tools like the service controller (`sc.exe`), PowerShell, or the `reg` command can be used to modify these registry entries.

Access to these registry keys is controlled by access control lists (ACLs) and user permissions. If these permissions are misconfigured, adversaries can gain the necessary access to alter the registry entries and redirect the service to their malicious payload.

By leveraging this technique, attackers can ensure that their malicious code is executed whenever the service is started, providing a persistent and stealthy method of maintaining a foothold in the system.
