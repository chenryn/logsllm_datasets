### Title: Testing Your Organization's Social Media Awareness

**Abstract:**

The landscape of phishing attacks is evolving rapidly, with a significant increase—over 10-fold—in social media-based phishing in recent years. Despite this, social media platforms have made limited progress in detecting and blocking automated intelligence gathering. Consequently, many organizations are still grappling to understand the new risks their users face on these platforms.

In this presentation, I will explore how new tools can automate the process of social media intelligence gathering. These tools can correlate profiles across multiple sites and scrape data on a large scale. By leveraging this information, organizations can identify which employees are most likely to be targeted by social media-based attacks. This includes employees who frequently accept random connection requests on LinkedIn or Facebook, and those who click on untrusted links on their work devices.

For red team attackers, I will also discuss how to scale up social media phishing campaigns and save time when conducting large-scale operations. During the talk, I will provide an in-depth overview of **Social Mapper** and introduce **Social Attacker**, the first open-source, multi-site, automated Social Media Phishing Framework. I will walk through the process of using these tools to conduct mock social media phishing campaigns within your organization, helping you to better understand and mitigate the associated risks.

Join me to learn more about these tools and how they can enhance your organization's social media security posture.
