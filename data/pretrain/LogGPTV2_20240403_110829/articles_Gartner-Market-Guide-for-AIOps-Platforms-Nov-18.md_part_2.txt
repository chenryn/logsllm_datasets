### Actionable Data and Domain-Centric Monitoring Tools

Domain-centric monitoring tools will continue to exist, providing data capture, analysis, and visualization specific to their domains for specialists. However, these tools will forward their data streams to an AIOps platform, which acts as a lens to focus the data into a single, coherent cross-domain analysis. For more details, refer to "Deliver Cross-Domain Analysis and Visibility With AIOps and Digital Experience Monitoring."

### Evolving AIOps Capabilities

As the market evolves, Gartner has observed several trends in AIOps capabilities:

- **Data-Source-Agnostic AIOps Platforms**: Vendors are developing generic platforms that cater to a broad range of use cases.
- **Domain-Specific Vendors**: These vendors have key components but are limited to specific data sources, such as network, endpoint systems, or application performance management (APM). They target specific segments of IT operations.
- **Existing Monitoring Solutions**: Some vendors limit data sources to their own monitoring products or extend to a limited partner ecosystem, catering to a specific audience with the right mix of data sources.
- **Open-Source Projects**: These projects enable users to assemble their own AIOps platforms by offering tools for data ingestion, big data platforms, machine learning (ML), and visualization layers. Users can mix and match components from multiple providers.

### Advantages of AIOps Platforms

AIOps platforms offer significant advantages over traditional monitoring tools with embedded AIOps. They are not constrained by a static data model, allowing them to capture patterns, anomalies, and causal structures in the data itself. Monitoring tools may miss these features as they force data into predetermined models.

### Market Recommendations

#### Incremental Approach to AIOps Deployment

Effective deployment of AIOps requires a structured approach, starting with the reorganization of IT domains according to data sources. Begin with mastering the use of large persistent datasets ingested from various sources. Once the IT operations team is fluent with the big data aspect, they can then focus on the capability categories. Enterprises should prioritize vendors that allow for the independent deployment of data ingestion, storage, and access, separate from other AIOps components. Given the multi-use case nature of AIOps, I&O leaders must ensure that vendors support the gradual addition of functionalities.

#### Support for Broad Data Types

Modern IT operations aim for composite visibility across IT entities, including applications, relationships, interdependencies, and past transformations. The selection of the right data source is crucial to avoid blind spots. I&O leaders must choose AIOps platforms capable of ingesting and providing access to a wide range of historical and streaming data types. For example, AIOps can be used to provide a consolidated analysis of digital experience across multiple digital services by using pattern detection algorithms and machine learning to analyze various data sources, such as APM, order data, sentiment data, service desk requests, and CRM activity.

#### Systematic Progression Through IT-Operations-Oriented Analytics

Tools that support the incremental deployment of the four phases of IT-operations-oriented analytics and machine learning should be prioritized. These phases include:

1. **Data Visualization and Basic Statistical Analysis**: Start with mastering data visualization and basic statistical analysis.
2. **Pattern Detection**: Experiment with software to reveal patterns in large volumes of data.
3. **Anticipation of Future Events**: Test the degree to which these patterns allow the anticipation of future events and incidents.
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Work with root cause analysis functionality.

All four phases are important, and enterprises should select tools that support as many as possible, ensuring that IT operations can derive value as they learn.
