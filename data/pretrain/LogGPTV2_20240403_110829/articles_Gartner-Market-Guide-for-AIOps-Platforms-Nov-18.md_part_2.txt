and more actionable data. Domain-centric monitoring tools will continue to exist providing data
capture, analysis and visualization of their domains for the specialist. However, they will forward
their data streams to an AIOps platform, acting as a lens where the data will be focused into a
single, coherent cross-domain analysis (see “Deliver Cross-Domain Analysis and Visibility With
AIOps and Digital Experience Monitoring”).
As the market evolves, Gartner has observed evolving AIOps capabilities across various
dimensions:
■ Vendors going to market with a data-source-agnostic AIOps platform. These products tend to
be generic and cater to the broadest use cases.
■ Vendors that have the key components, but tend to have a restricted set of data sources. These
vendors are typically focused on one domain (for example, network, endpoint systems and
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5VNK3KA&ct=181130&st=sb 7/14

APM), or are selective about data types like alert streams from other tools. Such tools tend to
have a restricted set of use cases, targeted at a certain segment of IT operations.
■ Some vendors with existing monitoring solutions limit data sources to their own monitoring
products or extend to a limited partner ecosystem. This is again a case where the target
audience is limited to those with the right mix of data sources.
■ Some open-source projects enable users to assemble their own AIOps platforms by offering
tools for data ingest, a big data platform, ML and a visualization layer. End users can mix and
match the components from multiple providers.
AIOps platforms add important capabilities beyond what a monitoring tool with embedded AIOps
can provide. The AIOps platforms free from the implied lock-in to a static data model expressed in
monitoring tools is able to capture the patterns, anomalies and causal structures in the data itself.
Monitoring tools may miss these features in the data as they force it into their predetermined
models.

Market Recommendations
Ensure Success in the Deployment of AIOps Functionality by Adopting an
Incremental Approach
The effective deployment of AIOps functionality requires a structured approach starting with the
reorganization of IT domains according to data sources. This approach shifts the required focus
toward datasets as opposed to tools, which has been the traditional approach. Gartner has found
that it is best to begin with mastering the use of large persistent datasets ingested from a variety
of sources. Only after the IT operations team has become fluent with the big data aspect of AIOps
should it attempt mastery of the capability categories (see “12 Steps to Artificial Intelligence for IT
Operations Excellence”). Hence, when selecting tools or services, an enterprise should prioritize
those vendors that allow for the deployment of data ingestion, storage and access, independent
from the remaining AIOps components. Given that AIOps will be used for multiple use cases, I&O
leaders must ensure that the vendors support the gradual addition of those other functionalities.
Select AIOps Platforms Capable of Supporting a Broad Range of Historical and
Streaming Data Types
Modern IT operations aim to gain a composite visibility to IT entities, including applications, their
relationships, interdependencies and past transformations to gain insight to the present state of
the overall IT landscape. Selection of the right data source is crucial in avoiding blind spots. The
progressive nature of deployment maturity and evolving use cases requires a readiness to ingest a
variety of data sources. I&O leaders must select AIOps platforms that are capable of ingesting and
providing access to a broad range of historical and streaming data types (see Figure 3).
Figure 3. Data Types for Ingestion in AIOps

AIOps platforms have historically focused on a single data source like logs or metrics.
Unfortunately, no matter how large or frequently updated a given dataset is, restriction to a single
data type tends to limit the insights into system behavior. Modern IT systems — with their
modularity and dynamism — require a multiperspective approach to understand what is happening
as they are being observed.
As an example, AIOps can be used to provide a consolidated analysis of digital experience across
multiple digital services.
For example, use a pattern detection algorithm to improve the customer relationship process by
detecting the patterns of behavior customers expressed in digital experience monitoring data. Use
the machine learning algorithms in AIOps to perceive the patterns that relate user navigation with:
■ Digital experience data from APM
■ Order data pulled from payloads in business transactions
■ Sentiment data from social media
■ Service desk requests and statuses
■ Account activity from the CRM system
Utilize this approach to build a composite model of a customer across all applications they use
and even different behaviors across multiple modes of a single application (for example, when
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5VNK3KA&ct=181130&st=sb 11/14
20/02/2019 Gartner Reprint
they use a web browser versus a mobile device). This can be used to predict customer churn and
provide the insight and time necessary to prevent customer loss.
Choose Tools Offering the Ability to Systematically Progress Across the Four
Phases of IT-Operations-Oriented Analytics and Machine Learning
Tools that support the incremental deployment of the four phases of IT-operations-oriented
machine learning must be given a higher priority for investment (see Figure 5).
Figure 4. Four Phases of IT Operations
Source: Gartner (November 2018)
One of the key attributes toward enhancing IT operations teams’ skills is an incremental approach.
The deployment of AI in an IT operations context is difficult and must be approached gradually. IT
operations teams should begin their AI journey by becoming adept at data visualization and the
use of basic statistical analysis. Resist the temptation to do it all at once. Only after these core
“manual” disciplines have been mastered should machine learning proper be approached as
follows:
■ Initially experiment with allowing the software to reveal patterns that organize large volumes of
data.
■ Next, test the degree to which those patterns allow them to anticipate future events and
incidents.
■ Finally, work with root cause analysis functionality.
All four of these phases of AIOps are important, and enterprises should select tools that support
as many as possible. These phases should be deployable in a modular manner, but also to ensure
https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-5VNK3KA&ct=181130&st=sb 12/14
20/02/2019 Gartner Reprint
that IT operations can obtain value as they learn.

Representative Vendor Selection
The vendors listed in this research are picked as a sample based on one or two of the following
criterion:
■ Ability to ingest data from multiple sources, including historic and real-time streaming.
■ Different offerings that include proprietary, open source, free and commercialized versions,
including deployment that cuts across on-premises and SaaS-based options.

Data Types
■ Log data ingestion — Software that allows for the capture of alphanumeric text strings from log
files generated by any software or hardware device, and the preparation of that data for access
and analysis, indexed for storage.
■ Wire data ingestion — Software that allows for the capture of packet data direct from taps on
the network. All protocol and flow information should be prepared for access and analysis, and
indexed for storage.
■ Metric data ingestion — Software that allows for the direct capture of numerical data (for
example, the capture of data to which time series and more general mathematical operations
can be immediately applied).
■ Document text ingestion — Software that allows for the ingestion, parsing, and syntactical and
semantic indexing of human readable documents. This may include the use of technologies
