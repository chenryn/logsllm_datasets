### Malware in the Gaming Micro-economy
**Authors: Zack Allen and Rusty Bower**

#### Background for Non-Gamers
- **Non-functional cosmetic items** were introduced in 2009.
- In 2010, an update was released that allowed players to trade hats and weapons with each other.
- This feature has since been expanded to other games, including:
  - CS:GO
  - DOTA 2
  - League of Legends

#### History of Scams
- **How it all started**: The introduction of tradable in-game items created a micro-economy within the gaming community, which unfortunately also attracted malicious actors.

#### Steam User Stats
- **Steampunks - Chasing the Criminals**
  - **PokeStealer**
    - **Attack Method**: The attacker runs an Auto-Accept Bot and distributes `Stub.exe` to victims using various methods.
  - **cursevoice.exe**
    - **Installation**: Installs Curse Voice and a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), giving the attacker persistent access to the victimâ€™s computer.
  - **mumble**
    - **Malicious Script**: Drops JavaScript with anti-analysis protections.
    - **Behavior**: Steals private information from browsers, uses `WScript.exe`, and installs into the Startup folder.
  - **raidcall**
    - **Malicious Script**: Drops JavaScript.
    - **Behavior**: Attempts to sleep for approximately 62 days (`QEQWASDFASDF.PNG.EXE tried to sleep 1566864 seconds`), steals private information from browsers, uses `WScript.exe`, and installs into the Startup folder.
  - **YourSpeaks**
    - **Unhooks multiple Windows functions**.
    - **Behavior**: Steals private information from browsers, installs into autorun, performs process injection, and makes HTTP requests.

#### Valve Responses/Fixes
- **Forecast**
  - **Image Site Homographs/Phishing**: These will likely be the preferred method due to their difficulty in detection and lack of clear brand abuse.
  - **Screenshots**: Will be consistently used by traders/buyers.
  - **Malware Evolution**: Malware will evolve beyond just stealing virtual items to include keyloggers, RATs, and more.

#### Recommendations
- **Valve**
  - **Existing Measures**: Already have an anticheat system (VAC) and a platform security team for Steam.
  - **Enhancements**
    - **Text Analytics and URL Scanning**: Implement Safebrowsing and Phishtank.
    - **Platform Plugins**: Allow the community to develop and police the marketplace for apps.
- **Gamers**
  - **Browser Security**: Use URL scanning capabilities in browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
