Im not sure if this is an implementation issue or Doctrine itself. But if i
was to create two identical entities and persist them, why does doctrine store
two entries in the database? surely the idea of a DBAL is to handle
normalisation for you? Is there a way you can prevent duplicate entries in the
database?
            $address = new Address();
            $address->setTitle('Mr');
            $address->setFirstname('Sam');
            $this->em->persist($address);
            $address1 = new Address();
            $address1->setTitle('Mr');
            $address1->setFirstname('Sam');
            $this->em->persist($address1);
I feel doctrine should not persist the second entity but just pretend it has.
It should then only create two rows if the two entities where to become
different.
