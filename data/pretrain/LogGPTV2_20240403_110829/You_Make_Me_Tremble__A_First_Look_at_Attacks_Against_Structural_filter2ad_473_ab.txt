Table 1: Possible Attacks for Each Type of Actuator. Y de-
notes physical attacks. X denotes that the attack can be
launched through a cyber-attack.
Once inside the system, the attacker can launch a variety of DoS
or FDI attacks. DoS attacks can be launched by blocking (or not even
sending) the control signal to active or semi-active actuators. DoS
attacks can also occur by shutting down the electric power to the
building: without power, active and semi-active actuators cannot
be controlled. Finally, an insider can launch DoS attacks against
passive actuators (the attacker can physically destroy the damper).
FDI attacks can be launched by an attacker that compromised the
industrial PC. The industrial PC can then send malicious control
signals to the active or semi-active actuators. A malicious supply
chain attack providing a compromised microcontroller can also
be used to launch FDI attacks. Table 1 shows a summary of this
discussion.
In this paper, we assume an attacker that can disrupt the com-
munication link to the actuators (DoS attack), and another one who
has partial (or total) access to the control system and can send false
control commands to the actuators (FDI attack). We also assume
the attacker has some knowledge about the operation and design
of the structural control system.
3.2 Damage Metrics
To understand the impact of attacks, we need to look at how struc-
tural engineers evaluate risks to buildings and bridges. The standard
ASCE 7-16 [51] is an integral part of building codes in the US and
is adopted by the International Building Code, the International
Existing Building Code, the International Residential Code, and
the NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code. In ASCE
7-16, the primary metric to evaluate the effects of wind and seis-
mic events is the Inter-Story Drift (ISD) (lateral deflection of a
building) as drifts damage cladding, nonstructural walls, and par-
titions [87]. The allowable drift limits placed by ASCE 7-16 are
functions of the risk category and type of seismic forces. ASCE
7-16 Section 12.12 states the allowable drift for any floor in most
structures is 0.020ℎ𝑠𝑥 , 0.015ℎ𝑠𝑥 , 0.010ℎ𝑠𝑥 , for Risk Category I or II,

embedded computers near sensors and actuators to capture and
convert physical signals to computer information [10, 61, 81, 101].
Fig. 3 illustrates how computers and networks are integrated in the
control of the Guangzhou tower, Fig. 4 shows the technology in the
Walnut Creek Bridge, and Fig. 5 illustrates how an AMD actuator
is instrumented within the Kyobashi Seiwa Building.
As we can see, these systems use computers and networks that
can be attacked with methods that worked for similar technolo-
gies [6, 15, 40, 52, 79, 106]. In general, these networks are air-gapped
and assume a trusted insider setting, but as the Stuxnet attack
showed, air-gapped networks are not immune to attacks (especially
not against state-sponsored attacks). A malicious insider, an un-
trusted contractor, a supply-chain attack, or malware on a device

III, and IV, respectively, where ℎ𝑠𝑥 is the story height below level
x. The Risk Category is based on the risk to human life, health,
and welfare associated with structural damage or by the nature
of their occupancy or use. For example, buildings designated as
essential facilities such as hospitals have a Risk Category IV and
will require a drift limit of 1% of the height of all floors. Buildings
that create a substantial risk to human life have a Risk Category III,
and buildings that pose a low risk to human life are Risk Category I.
Similarly, the National Building Code of Canada limits ISD to 1% of
the height of the floors for post-disaster buildings that must remain
in operation immediately after an earthquake [33].
Fig. 6 illustrates the ISD-damage relationship for concrete and
steel buildings, adapted from the NEHRP Guidelines for the Seismic
Rehabilitation of Buildings [77]. If a building has an ISD above
its elastic range, a few places start presenting some permanent
distortion; however they are repairable by replacing the affected
components. A more severe ISD can create visible deformation in
beams and columns. Damage in concrete structures is evident with
the propagation of cracks instead of distortion of components. If the
displacements in the structure are higher, there is extensive cracking
and severe damage in the structure that can bring the structure near
collapse [77]. We can see that a 1% ISD is at the boundary between
reparable and irreparable damages. We highlight this value in our
simulations to show when attacks can cause significant damages.
Since bridges do not have several stories, we need to use a dif-
ferent metric. The most common metrics for predicting bridge
damages are the lateral displacement and the lateral force [41]. We
will use them to analyze the impact of attacks on bridges.
4 DESIGNING OPTIMAL ATTACKS
Buildings, bridges, and soil/rock formations have several vibration
frequencies at which they tend to oscillate more strongly, as il-
lustrated in Fig. 7. When these peaks are large enough, they are
called resonant frequencies. An attacker trying to damage an in-
frastructure can launch DoS or FDI attacks to change the frequency
response of the building and maximize the magnitude and the num-
ber of amplifying frequencies. In addition, if a building vibrates at
the same frequency as the input seismic wave, the vibrations may
double in amplitude, causing devastating consequences [3].
Launching attacks to drive a building or a bridge to oscillate
at a resonant frequency is not obvious. This section studies the
risk that sophisticated attackers may pose when they design a
strategic attack. We assume that the adversary has gained (full or

partial) access to the building’s control system. We consider DoS
attacks (interrupting communications to actuators) and FDI attacks
(sending false commands to actuators) and demonstrate their effects
on real and simulated scenarios based on well-known benchmarks
from structural engineering societies. We first define a dynamical
system model that characterizes the controlled structure and later
propose strategies to design attacks that maximize their impact
over the building.
4.1 Mathematical Description of a Structure
The design of active and semi-active vibration controllers uses well-
known equations of motion for a building or bridge (see Appendix
A) that describe how the lumped masses, stiffness, and damping
properties of the elements of a structure interact to change their
position, velocity, and acceleration [43]. The model has three main
variables: i) the structure’s state variables x, which typically in-
clude displacements and their velocities at different points in the
structure; ii) the forces that are exerted by the actuators trying to
stabilize the structure u; and iii) forces that are exerted by external
disturbances such as earthquakes and wind w. If we denote the
variations of the structure’s state variables by x (the derivative of x
with respect to time), the mathematical model of the structure is
¤x = Ax + Bu + Ew
z = Fx
(1)
where A, B, and E are matrix elements that are used to represent the
combined action of variables x, u, and w. The matrix F is a mask that
selects only those state variables that we want to attack. Therefore, z
contains such variables. A popular vibration control system consists
of a feedback control strategy represented by u = −Rx, where R is
a matrix gain [107]. Structural engineers design this control matrix
to reduce the displacement of the structure caused by external
disturbances.

A DoS attack is opportunistic, and therefore it will only be damag-
ing if it is launched during an occurring natural event (earthquake
or high winds). Since attackers cannot predict the type of vibra-
tions this natural hazard will create in the structure, they need
to maximize the damage over the maximum number of potential
perturbations. To capture this criterion, we study the 𝐻2 norm of
a system [107], which can be seen as the power of the response
of the dynamical system to external disturbances for a wide range
of frequencies. A large 𝐻2 norm indicates that the response of the
structure to external disturbances will be large as well for a wide
range of frequencies. If the DoS attack is designed in a way to
maximize the 𝐻2 norm, then it has a high chance of damaging the
system.
The 𝐻2 norm of Eq. (1) is defined as:
||H𝑧𝑤 ||2 = (cid:18) 1
2𝜋 ∫ +∞
−∞
Trace(cid:0)H𝑧𝑤 ( 𝑗𝜔)H∗
𝑧𝑤 ( 𝑗𝜔)(cid:1)𝑑𝜔(cid:19) 1/2
.
Now, let x𝑠 be a 𝑛-dimensional binary vector that indicates what
actuators the adversary will disconnect: entry 𝑖 is 1 if the 𝑖-th is not
attacked, and 0 otherwise. The 𝐻2 norm of the controlled system
with the feedback matrix gain R is defined as ℎ2 (xs) = ||H𝑧𝑤 ||2,
where H𝑧𝑤 ( 𝑗𝜔) = F( 𝑗𝜔I − A𝑐𝑙 )−1E, A𝑐𝑙 = A + BR𝑛𝑒𝑤 , and R𝑛𝑒𝑤 =
diag(1 − x𝑠 )R. Then, the actuators to be affected by the DoS attack
can be chosen by the following optimization process:
maximize
x𝑠 ∈Z𝑛
ℎ2 (xs)
subject to:
𝑛𝑖 =1
𝑥𝑖
𝑠 = 𝑘
𝑥𝑖
𝑠 ∈ {0, 1} ∀𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑛.

4.3 False Data Injection (FDI) Attack
An adversary launching an FDI attack on the control system changes
the system’s frequency response (e.g., it changes the curve in Fig. 7).
Therefore we need a process based on two steps: i) finding those 𝑘
actuators such that, if their control is blocked, then the response
of the system controlled by the remaining 𝑛 − 𝑘 actuators is maxi-
mized at a particular frequency of the force exerted by the blocked
actuators; and ii) designing the control signals at the frequency
with the maximum response of the system to be injected to the
attacked actuator.
In contrast to DoS attacks, an FDI attack will attempt to maxi-
mize the frequency response of an individual frequency of attack.
Therefore in this case we use the 𝐻∞ norm of a system [107], which
is the maximum gain of the system for a given control input at a
specific frequency. This norm can be seen as the maximum response
of the system for a given set of inputs that oscillate at a specific fre-
quency. The 𝐻∞ norm is computed using the representation of the
structure in Eq. (1) and the control policy that defines the stabilizing
forces u as follows. Let H𝑧𝑢 ( 𝑗𝜔) be the transfer function matrix of
the structure, representing the response of the stable system with
outputs z for the input control signals u. These input signals are
the ones that inject energy into the system to try to control the
vibrations of the structure. Let ¯𝜎𝐻 (𝜔) be the largest singular value
of matrix H𝑧𝑢 ( 𝑗𝜔). Then, the 𝐻∞ norm of a system with transfer
function H𝑧𝑢 ( 𝑗𝜔) is
||H𝑧𝑢 ||∞ = sup
𝜔
¯𝜎𝐻 (𝜔) = sup
| |u | |2 ≠0
||z||2
||u||2
.
(3)
Let x𝑠 be a 𝑛-dimensional binary vector that indicates what
actuators are not attacked by the adversary: entry 𝑖 is 1 if the 𝑖-th
is not attacked, and 0 otherwise. The 𝐻∞ norm of the controlled
system with the feedback matrix gain R is defined as ℎ∞ (x𝑠 ) =
||H𝑧𝑢 ||∞, where H𝑧𝑢 ( 𝑗𝜔) = F( 𝑗𝜔I − A𝑐𝑙 )−1B, A𝑐𝑙 = A + BR𝑛𝑒𝑤 ,
and R𝑛𝑒𝑤 = diag(1−x𝑠 )R. Here, H𝑧𝑢 is the transfer function matrix
that captures the response of the outputs of the controlled system
z with the control inputs u. The attack is designed in two steps:
Step 1: The adversary determines which actuators will be dis-
connected from the central control system such that the peak of the
frequency response of the system is maximized, via the following
optimization process:
maximize
x𝑠 ∈Z𝑛
ℎ∞ (x𝑠 )
subject to:
𝑛𝑖 =1
𝑥𝑖
𝑠 = 𝑘
(4)
𝑥𝑖
𝑠 ∈ {0, 1} ∀𝑖 = 1, . . . , 𝑛.
Step 2: The adversary needs to determine the magnitude and
phase of the signals that will be injected into the actuators. From
Eq. (3), the 𝐻∞ norm corresponds to the largest singular value of
matrix H𝑧𝑢 ( 𝑗𝜔), that is, ¯𝜎𝐻 (𝜔). We know that the input vector
that produces this maximum gain corresponds to the right-singular
vector associated with the largest singular value ¯𝜎𝐻 (𝜔) [38]. This
right-singular vector contains the amplitude and phases that the
sinusoidal signals to be injected into the actuators. This vector is
known as the direction of the input signal. This is a unitary vector,
meaning that amplitudes of the sinusoidal signals are such that the
Euclidean norm of this vector is 1. The magnitude of this vector
can be amplified by any constant that keeps the signals inside the
range of operation of the actuators.
5 QUANSER TESTBED
Our first experiment is conducted using Quanser’s bench-scale
model that emulates a building equipped with active mass dampers
(AMDs) subjected to earthquake loading, as shown in Fig. 8. The
plant is a two-story building-like structure with two active masses1
and a shake table that generates an external earthquake-like dis-
turbance2. Two accelerometers are used to estimate the position
and velocity of two different points of the structure relative to the
ground. The frame of the structure is made of steel and has a flexible
facade. The computer program sending commands to the actua-
tors (AMDs) is a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), an algorithm
commonly used to suppress vibrations in tall buildings [73]. The
parameters of the mathematical model of the structure as in Eq. (1)
and the control parameters of the LQR are given in Appendix B.
The state variables from the vector x in Eq. (1) are (i) the position
of the moving cart at floor 1 𝑥𝑐1, (ii) the position of the moving cart
of floor 2 𝑥𝑐2, (iii) displacement at floor 1 𝑥 𝑓 1, (iv) displacement at
floor 2 𝑥 𝑓 2, (v) velocity of cart 1 ¤𝑥𝑐1, (vi) velocity of cart 2 ¤𝑥 𝑓 2, (vii)
