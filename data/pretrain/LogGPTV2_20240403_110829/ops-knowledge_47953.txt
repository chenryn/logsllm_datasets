User: I am installing modules with homebrew and other installers, and they are not recognized by my default python. Module installations with easy_install (such as pip) appear to be available for my system and system python). 
My default python is located here and is this version: 

15:49 [~]: which python
    /usr/local/bin/python
15:49 [~]: python -d
  Python 2.7.2 (default, Mar 18 2012, 15:13:08)
  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5577)] on darwin Type "help",
  "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

The packages do appear to be located in /library/frameworks/, GEOS.framework is one example. 
What do I need to modify to gain access to my modules?
System: Mac os x 10.5.8
Assistant: From the Homebrew page: "Homebrew installs packages into their own isolated prefix and then symlinks everything into /usr/local"
I think that the OS X preinstalled python looks for modules in
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current//lib/python2.7/site-packages
So maybe you need to symlink your Homebrew installed packages to there.
