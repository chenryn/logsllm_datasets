User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Disk full, du tells different. How to further investigate? I have a SCSI disk in a server (hardware Raid 1), 32G, ext3 filesytem. df tells me that the disk is 100% full. If I delete 1G this is correctly shown.

However, if I run a du -h -x / then du tells me that only 12G are used (I use -x because of some Samba mounts).

So my question is not about subtle differences between the du and df commands but about how I can find out what causes this huge difference?

I rebooted the machine for a fsck that went w/out errors. Should I run badblocks? lsof shows me no open deleted files, lost+found is empty and there is no obvious warn/err/fail statement in the messages file.

Feel free to ask for further details of the setup.

Assistant: Just stumbled on this page when trying to track down an issue on a local server.

In my case the df -h and du -sh mismatched by about 50% of the hard disk size.

This was caused by apache (httpd) keeping large log files in memory which had been deleted from disk.

This was tracked down by running lsof | grep "/var" | grep deleted where /var was the partition I needed to clean up.

The output showed lines like this:
httpd     32617    nobody  106w      REG        9,4 1835222944     688166 /var/log/apache/awstats_log (deleted)

The situation was then resolved by restarting apache (service httpd restart), and cleared up 2gb of disk space, by allowing the locks on deleted files to be cleared.
