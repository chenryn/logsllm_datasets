their part. If the YubiKey is not already inserted, the user
is prompted to insert it. The prompt is incredibly vague,
only displaying the words “Status:” under the password bar.
Authentication succeeds once the user inserts the YubiKey.
Importantly, Windows 10 YubiKey authentication is not U2F
compliant, as the user does not need to press the button on the
YubiKey, and more closely resembles traditional smart card
2FA.
The second tool, YubiKey for Windows Hello, requires far
fewer steps to set up than the Windows Logon Authorization
Tool. All the user must do is install the application, create a
PIN for their Windows account, and register a YubiKey with
the application. Following the set up of YubiKey for Windows
Hello, users still enter their standard Windows credentials to
log into Windows after their computer ﬁrst starts up, but can
subsequently insert the YubiKey (no tap required) or enter their
PIN in place of entering their password to re-authenticate at the
lock screen—for example, after the computer wakes from sleep.
Unlike the Windows Logon Authorization Tool, YubiKey for
Windows Hello is still single-factor authentication, replacing
something the user knows (password or PIN) with something
they have (YubiKey).
IV. MEASURING SETUP USABILITY—METHODOLOGY
There are two dimensions to the usability of security keys:
setting up the security key and using the security key in daily
life. In this section, we describe our laboratory study to evaluate

the ability of non-expert users to set up a security key without
any assistance from a study coordinator. In Section VI we
explore the day-to-day usability of security keys. Both of these
studies were approved by our institution’s IRB and the data
gathered from each is available at https://isrl.byu.edu/data/
sp2018/.
A. Study Design
The laboratory study ran for two weeks—beginning June
15, 2017, and ending June 26, 2017. In total, 31 participants
completed the study and each was compensated $15 USD. The
study ran between 25 and 70 minutes.
At the beginning of each study, participants were provided
with a YubiKey 4 in its original packaging. Participants were
then directed to use the next 5 minutes to learn about the
YubiKey by accessing the Internet on a laboratory desktop
computer. This was intended to compensate for the fact that
most participants had no prior experience with a YubiKey and
that in real life, users would have read about YubiKeys before
purchasing one and receiving it in the mail.
Participants were then given three tasks: set up the YubiKey
to be used as part of the login process for Google, Facebook,
and Windows 10. An enumeration of the six possible task
orderings was created and shufﬂed. Each participant was
sequentially assigned to one of the task orderings (i.e., P1–P6
each used a different ordering, P7 used the same ordering as P1,
etc.) Approximately 15 minutes were allocated for each task.
Participants completed these tasks using account credentials
provided by the study coordinator; the provided Windows 10
account was a local Windows account not linked to a Microsoft
account. To mimic the user’s normal computing environment,
all major browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Mozilla Firefox,
Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer) were available, even
though only Google Chrome and Opera supported U2F at that
time. Participants had open access to the Internet, but at no
time did they receive assistance from the study coordinator in
setting up the YubiKey.
During the study, coordinators took notes on any sources the
participant used both during the orientation period and while
attempting to complete each task. We also captured audio
and screen recordings for each participant. Participants were
instructed to inform the coordinator when they completed the
task. Coordinators noted speciﬁcally whether the participant
was successful at conﬁguring the YubiKey for each system.
If the task took overly long (20 minutes), participants were
asked to abandon the current task and move onto the next
task. Participants were also allowed to move on if they decided
they could not complete the task. If the participant was not
successful, then the coordinator also noted the reason for the
failure (for instance, the participant ran out of time, followed
incorrect documentation, etc.)
After the participants had completed all three tasks, they
answered a three-part survey. The ﬁrst part of the survey was the
standard System Usability Scale (SUS) [20], [24] questionnaire,
consisting of a ten-item Likert scale. We chose to calculate a
single SUS score at the end of the three tasks rather than after
each because we wanted to transcend the current interfaces of
each service to understand the overall usability of YubiKeys.
We also wanted to ensure sufﬁcient time for the participant to
try all the systems and to avoid survey fatigue.
The second portion of the study’s survey contained six
additional Likert
items inquiring about attitudes toward
YubiKeys. The survey concluded with a few free-response
questions and some basic demographic questions. These
questions were coded by two researchers to report the quantities
we present in our results.
B. Recruitment
We recruited 32 participants using posters (available in the
appendix) in dozens of locations across the Brigham Young
University campus. We requested that participants have prior
experience with Facebook, Gmail, and Windows 10 to help
ensure that the usability results reﬂected the experience of
setting up the YubiKey and did not result from a lack of
experience with any of the three systems. Of the initial 32
participants, one arrived so late that they did not have sufﬁcient
time to properly attempt all three tasks. Because of this
substantially differing treatment, this participant’s data was
ultimately excluded from our results, leaving a total of 31
participants, referred to hereafter as A1–A31.
C. Demographics
Participants in our study skewed male: male (22; 70%),
female (9; 29%). Nearly all were young adults: 18–25 years (25;
80%), 26–35 years (4; 12%), 46–55 years (2; 6%). Two-thirds
of the participants had completed some college but did not yet
have a degree: some college with no degree (20; 64%), associate
degree (2; 6%), bachelor’s degree (5; 16%), post-graduate
degree (4; 12%). Four in ten were currently using a 2FA
solution: currently using 2FA (13; 41%), previously used 2FA
(6; 19%), have never used 2FA (12; 38%). Most participants
reported having an intermediate level of computer expertise:
beginner (9; 29%), intermediate (18; 58%), advanced (4; 12%).
D. Limitations
Since the study was conducted in a laboratory, participants
may not behave the same as they would in the real world. The
study population was drawn from a college campus, so the
results are not generalizable. Future research could replicate
this study with different populations to gain additional insights
into the usability of security keys. Participants were not using
their personal accounts or machines, which may have affected
the user’s ability to properly set up the YubiKey. Still, this was
necessary to prevent users from accidentally locking themselves
out of their accounts.
V. MEASURING SETUP USABILITY—RESULTS
Table I reports how many users were able to set up the
YubiKey with each service (Google, Facebook, Windows 10).
We begin by reporting what resources our participants consulted
in their self-orientation. Then, based on study coordinator notes
and audio/video recordings we describe the common problems

encountered by participants. Finally, we report on the overall
SUS score, the responses to the post-study survey, and other
qualitative feedback from participants.
A. Self-Orientation
Even though we instructed the participants to learn about
YubiKeys on their own without any speciﬁc direction from
us, they were fairly consistent in where they went to learn
about YubiKeys during the self-orientation. Participants rarely
accessed the large printed URL on the shipping envelope,
but rather used the Google or Bing search engines to locate
YubiKey information. Most of them navigated to Wikipedia’s
entry on YubiKeys3 and to various internal pages/content on
Yubico’s web site.4 Several participants watched one of two
videos5,6 on the Yubico website. A couple of the participants
found other resources and one participant installed the YubiKey
for Windows Hello app.
B. Google
Most participants (26; 83%) successfully conﬁgured the
YubiKey to work with the Google account. Four of the
participants (4; 12%) reported being unsure whether they had
ﬁnished setting up the YubiKey, while twenty-two participants
(22; 70%) correctly ﬁnished and did not move ahead with
uncertainty. Two of these participants logged out and back
in several times after they had conﬁgured the YubiKey to
test whether or not it was working; unfortunately, neither
participant noticed that “don’t ask for the security key again on

they had also enabled 2FA in their account settings.
this computer” was automatically selected on their ﬁrst login,
leaving them confused as to why subsequent logins didn’t
require the YubiKey. The third participant tried registering
additional 2FA systems with their account, and the fourth
tried restarting their computer. Despite their uncertainty, all
participants had in fact set up the YubiKey correctly for Google.
Of the ﬁve participants (5; 16%) who failed to complete this
task, four enabled the phone number-based 2FA but failed to
notice the “Add a security key” link. Of these four participants,
only one thought that they had succeeded after setting up phone
number-based 2FA.
C. Facebook
Only a third of the participants (10; 32%) successfully
conﬁgured the YubiKey to work with their Facebook
account. Even successful participants had difﬁculty navigating
Facebook’s website to ﬁnd the options to enable security keys.
While there are instructions on Yubico’s website for setting
up a YubiKey with Facebook, they are out-of-date and only
caused more confusion for users.
Over half of the participants that failed to complete this task
(12; 38%) successfully registered the YubiKey with Facebook
but did not properly conﬁgure 2FA on the account. There were
two primary causes for this disconnect. First, Facebook requires
that users set up phone number-based or code generator-based
2FA before allowing users to use a security key. Second, even
if users properly registered 2FA for their account, it would be
inactive until the participant also “enabled” 2FA in the account
settings. Both of these problems were especially hard to detect
as the Facebook interface told users that they were ready to
use their security key when they were done registering it (see
Figure 3), regardless of whether they had completed the other
two steps to correctly set up 2FA for the account.
Participants also struggled to test whether the YubiKey was
set up correctly. If users attempted to log out and back in several
times to test the YubiKey, they would only be prompted to
use it on the ﬁrst attempt. After that, Facebook would store a
cookie in the browser that indicates that security key login was
no longer needed on the device. This is similar to Google’s
technique, but without the option to opt-out of having the device
remembered. Ultimately, this prevented four participants (4;
12%) from being sure whether they had properly set up the

Fig. 5. Participant responses to statements about the YubiKey
While the study did not require participants to restore access
to their Windows accounts, it is possible to do so through
safe mode, as long as YubiKey authentication has not also
been enabled for safe mode (not the default). If YubiKey
authentication has been enabled for safe mode, then the user
would have to either re-install Windows altogether or attempt
to change a Windows registry key via a recovery terminal.
This is especially problematic as installing the Windows Logon
Authorization Tool requires that users disconnect their Microsoft
account, disconnecting any cloud storage of settings that may
have initially been stored there.
E. SUS
After completing all three tasks, participants evaluated the
YubiKey 4 using the System Usability Scale (SUS). It received
a mean score of 49.7 and a standard deviation of 16.8. Based
on comparisons to other systems and contextual descriptions
provided by Bangor et al. and Sauro et al. [25], [26], [27],
[28] (see Figure 8 available in the appendix), this SUS score
falls between the 0th and 15th percentiles, is considered “not
acceptable,” and receives a F grade.
F. Likert Items
Participants were also asked to rate the following six
statements about the YubiKey using a 5-point Likert item:
Q1 I would like to keep using a YubiKey.
Q2 I would not always be able to ﬁnd my YubiKey when I
needed to log in.
Q3 I could easily keep YubiKey around me to use whenever
I log into all my accounts.
Q4 Using the YubiKey got easier to use by the second or
third time I set it up.
Q5 It would be worth the extra work to use the YubiKey to
protect my personal accounts.
Q6 I would rather get a code texted to my phone than use a
YubiKey.
Responses are summarized in Figure 5. Interestingly, half
of the participants (17; 54%) indicated that they would be
willing to accept YubiKey’s poor usability if it really could
better protect their accounts (Q5). This likely explains why
even though YubiKey received such poor SUS scores a third
of the participants (11; 35%) were willing to continue using it
Fig. 4.
.NET 3.5 was required to install the YubiKey software
YubiKey. As with Google, each uncertain user had conﬁgured
the key correctly.
D. Windows 10
In total, twelve participants (12; 38%) successfully set up
the YubiKey to work with their Windows accounts. Twenty-one
participants (21; 67%) attempted to set up the YubiKey using
the Windows Logon Authorization Tool and ﬁve succeeded,
giving a success rate of 24% for this tool. In contrast, twelve
participants (12; 38%) attempted to use YubiKey for Windows
Hello and seven succeeded, giving a success rate of 58% for
this tool.7
The differences in success rates can be attributed to the high
complexity of setting up the Windows Logon Authorization Tool
(see Section III). Especially problematic was the requirement
that users set up .NET 3.5. When the Windows Logon
Authorization Tool installer detected that .NET 3.5 was not
installed, it would prompt users to install it (see Figure 4).
Unfortunately, clicking on “Yes” would take users to a dead
link, requiring the users to manually discover where to obtain
the .NET 3.5 installer.8
Finally, six participants (6; 19%) locked themselves out
of their computers while attempting to setup the Windows
Logon Authorization Tool (more than successfully enabled
YubiKey using that tool). This occurs because the Windows
Logon Authorization Tool allows users to enable YubiKey
authentication without requiring the user to register a YubiKey.
This was especially likely to happen as after installation the
Windows Logon Authorization Tool would immediately prompt
users to enable YubiKey authentication: “YubiKey Logon is not
enabled. Do you want to enable it? (Yes/No).” After selecting
“Yes,” users were then shown a dialog informing them “YubiKey
Logon enabled, please reboot the computer for settings to take
effect.” Participants who immediately obeyed this message
and rebooted the computer were locked out of their accounts,
having failed to notice the GUI element that would have allowed
them to register the YubiKey before rebooting. This experience
was especially annoying to participants, with one participant
exclaiming, A6: “Now I can’t get onto my own computer—and
I’m out $50.”9
7Three participants attempted to setup both the Windows Logon Authorization
Tool and YubiKey for Windows Hello and one participant attempted neither.

(Q1) and just over a third (13; 41%) preferred it to SMS-based
2FA (Q6).
Most participants (20; 64%) also felt that setting up the
YubiKey got easier after the ﬁrst setup experience (Q4).
Additionally, most participants (19; 61%) felt they would have
little difﬁculty carrying the YubiKey around with them (Q3),
though almost half (14; 45%) noted that they might not always
be able to ﬁnd it when it was needed (Q2).
G. Open-Response Questions
To conclude the study, participants were asked three
open-ended questions. We used these written responses to
generate unique codebooks for each question through inductive
analysis. Then, two researchers independently coded responses
using the appropriate codebooks. We calculated Cohen’s kappa
for each of the nine codes to measure the inter-rater reliability.
These kappa values had a mean of 0.848 and median of 0.832
with a range from 0.592 to 1.000. Differences were reconciled
by the coders and the ﬁnal results are described below.
(1) What did you like about the experience of setting up the
YubiKey? About a quarter of the participants (7; 22%) were
enthusiastic about the security of 2FA and security keys in
particular:
A14: “I liked learning about a product I was unaware
of. It seems like a good idea to implement into
accounts that have extremely sensitive information.
I would like to see them around more if they were
easier to use.”
Four participants (4; 12%) also emphasized that while the
initial setup was difﬁcult, it was easy to use after that:
A11: “I liked how this could easily protect me and
was very simple and easy to use after I got everything
set up. I thought the design was very practical. I also
could easily see a great advantage for a company to
use this type of system.”
A20: “I liked that even though it took several steps to
set up the YubiKey, the process of using the YubiKey
afterwards was very simple.”
Additionally, eight participants (8; 25%) felt
the
instructions and documentation they found were mostly good
and easy-to-follow. Finally, two participants (2; 6%) indicated
that there was nothing positive about their experience.
that
(2) What would you improve about the experience of setting
up the YubiKey? Two-thirds of the participants (23; 74%)
requested improved setup instructions and documentation. Of
those, twelve (12; 38%) indicated that the instructions could be
improved in clarity and brevity, with ﬁve (5; 16%) suggesting
