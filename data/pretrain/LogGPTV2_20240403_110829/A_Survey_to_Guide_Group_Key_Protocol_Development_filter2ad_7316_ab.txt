members share a trusted third party (a shared friend or au-
thority) or exchange authentic keys using location-limited
channels, public key based group key protocols correspond
with respondents’ current practices.
The ﬁnal portion of the survey was intended to collect data
about how respondents establish trust with entities that they
only meet online. Given that respondents rarely exchange
keys with online correspondents, we asked questions re-
lated to how they verify an online identity corresponds to
a claimed physical identity. Once we know how respon-
dents establish trust with these correspondents, we can in-
fer what type of group protocols would make most sense
for use with members who do not meet in person. Without
meeting in person, a group protocol using a location-limited
channel is inappropriate. However, if correspondents share
a common friend or trusted authority, a web-of trust or a
PKI can help exchange authentic public keys. If correspon-
dents trust a server, the two can use secure communication
with that server (e.g., TLS or SSH) to act as a secure chan-
nel for string comparison during group protocols.
3.3 Survey Methodology
In this section, we discuss how we recruited subjects for
our survey and how this impacts the responses and our re-
sults. To help encourage participation, each respondent that
completed the survey was entered into a rafﬂe for one of
three $50 gift certiﬁcates. Our survey was advertised from
4/25/08 to 5/16/08 on the university’s electronic forum, the
Craig’s list (craigslist.org), and on one of the au-
thor’s blogs. The survey itself was posted on Survey Mon-
key, a survey website. On average it took 14 minutes for an
individual to complete the survey.
More technically experienced users browse these venues
which biases our survey population towards more techni-
cally inclined individuals. With greater technical experi-
ence, our population includes a larger number of users that
may consider security as an issue when communicating on-
line. A greater interest in technology also may bias users
to try new technologies, such as security software, as op-
posed to average computer users who are slower to adopt
new software or services and focus more on completing a
task.
In addition to more technical experience, a large portion of
our respondents were students. 29% of respondents used
.edu email addresses and 70% claimed to use online com-
munication for “school.” As such, our survey results include
data from a disproportionate number of younger and more
educated individuals.
Despite the large number of young, educated, and techno-
logically experienced respondents, the data from our survey
represents the population as a whole better than prior works
on group key protocols that only considered how security
researchers think individuals would manage groups [13].
We expect the population we sampled would be more in-
terested in adopting group key protocols than the general
population and thus our results are likely to be optimistic in
their estimates of adoption rates.
4 Survey Results
In this section, we describe the results from the survey and
interpret how users responses relate to the general issue of
group key protocols. After presenting some general infor-
mation about subjects’ responses, we present each section
of the survey in detail.
192 respondents started our survey and 150 completed the
entire survey. Further analysis showed that a small number
of users (5 or less) had entered possibly false information in
an attempt to quickly complete the survey and gain a chance
to win the prize. Speciﬁcally, these respondents answered
several open ended questions with symbols (e.g., “-”, “.”)
so the survey would let them continue and/or claimed to
have never met someone in person and later communicated
with them online. However, as the number of suspicious
answers was small and all respondents included some non-

easily adapt to group applications. Even though respon-
dents feel experienced with these forms of communication
they do not think that they are secure.
In order to see what people are currently doing to pro-
tect their communication we asked an open ended ques-
tion on how they prevented unwanted access. We grouped
responses into categories (see Figure 1). We found that
47% of respondents trusted a service provider (i.e., look
for https to webmail), 16% of respondents used security
software (e.g., PGP, encryption in Skype, or chat plug-ins),
14% relied on passwords, 9% limited disclosure (i.e., only
discussing private information in person), 6% used privacy
settings, and 7% said they take no steps to protect their com-
munication.
The largest step taken to protect data is to trust services
to deliver it to intended recipients. Despite knowing oth-
ers might be able to see their communication very few re-
spondents invested the time to use secure software. In fact
one respondent said he “previously used Off-the-record, an
encryption plugin available for some IM clients, including
Pidgin. Stopped when I realized that for me personally,
it wasn’t worth the inconveniences.” Group key protocols
have a difﬁcult road towards widespread adoption since fre-
quent and experienced users of electronic communication
often simply leave messages in the clear despite recogniz-
ing a threat to their privacy.
4.2 Current Group Management
To collect information about how respondents currently
manage groups we presented each individual with a group
communication related scenario that had a good chance of
matching something they had done in real life. Responses to
these questions help indicate what type of paradigm makes
sense during group formation, and how dynamic real life
groups are. Responses indicate respondents already utilize
face-to-face and multicast mechanism to setup groups so
group protocols do match their habits. In addition, respon-
dents recognize groups are dynamic and depending on the
situation prefer to modify the group, rather than having to
generate a new group when membership changes.
To ensure the task was applicable to a respondent, we asked
the respondent what type of electronic communication was
most common to them: business, social, managing medical
records, and personal ﬁnances. Of the 150 respondents to
complete the survey, 145 felt their communication was at
risk so only those respondents were asked how they man-
aged groups. Of the 145, 87 indicated their electronic com-
munication most often involved social situations. These 87
respondents were presented with a group scenario related to

4.1 Current Communication Habits
The ﬁrst goal in our survey was to determine: how our sur-
vey respondents currently communicate online, what kind
of secrecy they felt was possible when communicating on-
line, and how they ensured secrecy. To learn how respon-
dents communicate, we asked if they used various technolo-
gies daily, weekly, monthly, every few months, or never.
Not surprisingly, respondents indicated they used email
daily. On average, chat programs, email lists, social net-
working, and mobile messaging were used weekly. One
third of the respondents reported not using group pages such
as Google groups or Yahoo groups, however it is hard to de-
termine if they considered email lists through these services
as “using” the tool or just posting to a normal email list (a
separate category in our survey).
We also asked respondents to rate their comfort with using
these programs on a scale from 1 (unfamiliar) to 5 (very
comfortable) and if they felt their communication was se-
cure (impossible, difﬁcult, or easy for others to access their
communication). Respondents were most comfortable with
email (average comfort rating of 4.88) and least comfort-
able with group pages (average comfort rating or 2.96). In
terms of security only 3.3% felt that their online communi-
cation was impossible for others to access, 60% felt it was
difﬁcult for others to access and 36.7% felt it was simple.
While people felt a high level of experience with the tools
they used they still did not feel that their communication
was secure, possibly because they did not think the tool can
provide security.
Overall we found that respondents used chat and email the
most, which are direct forms of communication that can

tomed to communicating about business and were presented
with a scenario related to managing a business project. No
respondents indicated their online communication was re-
lated to the management of medical records or ﬁnances.
4.2.1 Group Formation
The ﬁrst task for any group is to deﬁne who is in the group,
inviting the proper individuals, and ensuring only they can
receive and send the relevant messages. The ﬁrst question
was an open-ended question about how respondents would
ﬁrst invite people to the surprise party or organize the ﬁrst
meeting for the business project. We grouped responses
into the following categories based on what communication
mechanism a respondent would use.
1. Invalid answer. These responses were off-topic or only indi-
cated a limited grasp of how to protect the information (i.e.,
“do not tell the guest of honor” in the surprise party sce-
nario).
2. Insecure unicast. These responses included the use of in-
stant messages or other one-on-one mechanisms that are in
the clear.
3. Insecure multicast. These responses included generating an
event page on Facebook or sending an email to the group in
the clear.
4. Secure unicast. Theses responses included the use of phone
lines or SMS messages that provide policy protected one-on-
one communication channels.
5. Secure multicast.
These responses included encrypted
emails, corporate wide secure networks/VPNs, and secured
corporate internal Wiki pages.
6. Face-to-face. Some respondents felt the most secure method
with the least likelihood of having communication leaked
was simply meeting in person.
These are useful categories since they relate to what group
key protocols would be applicable. With an insecure multi-
cast and secure unicast, respondents could transmit a pass-
word, compare strings, or emulate a location-limited chan-
nel using the secure unicast and performing all other group
key protocol messages in the insecure multicast medium. If
respondents have a secure multicast channel, they already
have some trusted public key to identify the server or the
VPN and could use that as an authority to verify other pub-
lic keys in a group key protocol. If respondents meet face-
to-face, most group key protocols – except for public key
protocols – could work as the authors originally intended.
Figure 2 indicates what percentage of respondents used
each communication mechanism in each of the scenarios. In
both scenarios, a small fraction of respondents (10 − 20%)
met in person to form groups. For a less formal surprise

party, a large number of respondents suggested emailing
the guests or using a Facebook event (an insecure mul-
ticast) with a signiﬁcant fraction using SMS messages or
phone calls (a secure unicast). If respondents were to com-
bine both of these methods, respondents could securely
form groups. However, it is a difﬁcult task to convince
respondents to do twice as much work to secure a group
when little is done to secure one-on-one communication
(see Section 4.1). For the business scenario, insecure email
lists were common, but a signiﬁcant fraction mentioned us-
ing encrypted emails and secured corporate networks and
servers. If respondents are willing to trust company servers
to protect communication, the respondents will also trust
the servers to provide certiﬁed public keys for other mem-
bers in their business project group, allowing for simple use
of public key based group key protocols. The reason for
the discrepancy may be the importance and duration of the
groups. Business groups last for a long time, and corpo-
rate espionage is a real issue, requiring companies to protect
their communication. Surprise parties are rarely planned
long in advance and the guest of honor rarely acts as an
adversary trying to access invitees’ communication. Social
groups may see security as irrelevant with such a small win-
dow of opportunity and little to lose.
4.2.2 Adding Members
Once a group is formed, additional members may want to
join the group. To determine how respondents would handle
such a situation, we asked respondents how they would in-
vite a guest they initially forgot about to the surprise party or
how they would add a new employee to the project. 78 of 87
(90%) party planners and 49 of 57 (86%) project managers
indicated they would want to add the member to the exist-
ing group (e.g., “include them on any future party emails” or
“add the employee to the server’s access control list”). Only

was an option.2 This is strong evidence that a group key
protocol must at least allow the addition of members after
group formation.
4.2.3 Removing Members
In some situations, a member of the group should no longer
receive communication from other group members. In that
scenario, the unwanted member must be removed from the
group or a new group is formed to maintain secrecy of any
future group communication. To analyze how respondents
would manage this task, respondents were asked how they
would deal with a project member who was ﬁred or a friend
who leaked information about the surprise party. In both
tasks the respondents were told the majority of the group
still needed to communicate; project members needed to
complete the project and guests needed to schedule a new
surprise party without letting the evicted member access
the information. An open-ended response was used to col-
lect respondents answers. We grouped responses depending
on whether a new group should be formed without the un-
wanted individual or if the old group should simply evict
the unwanted individual.
The responses were heavily situation dependent. In the sur-
prise party scenario, only 9% of respondents wanted to re-
conﬁgure the old group. 77% of party organizers preferred
to simply make a new group (i.e., “setup a new Facebook
event,” “generate a new email list,” etc.). The remain-
ing 14% provided unclear responses. In the corporate sce-
nario, the opposite was true. 76% of respondents mentioned
changing access to resources to stop the expelled employee
from accessing project information (i.e., “delete the ﬁred
employee’s account,” “remove privileges from the Wiki-
page,” etc.). Only 16% of respondents wanted to form a
new group (i.e., “change the password on the wiki” which
could mean a new group if a single password is used). These
results indicate the protocol should accommodate dynamic
groups where members are both added and deleted. How-
ever, the protocol should also be efﬁcient so that if respon-
dents choose to reform a new group whenever a member is
removed, the overhead is not an annoyance to the respon-
dent.
4.3 Making New Acquaintances in Person
To help understand how respondents establish trust and how
often groups meet, we asked a number of questions about
2The remaining respondents did not indicate how the addition would
be performed (i.e. “based on the person I’m inviting” or that no real group
communication was used (i.e., “things must be handled carefully”).
communication habits when ﬁrst contact is made ofﬂine and
in person. Based on these questions we can infer how re-
spondents begin to trust online identiﬁers and how often
groups do meet in person. Results indicate that as expected,
people often meet in person before they talk online. In ad-
dition, groups meet in person a signiﬁcant fraction of the
time and often share a trusted third party that could facilitate
the exchange of authentic public keys. Such results indicate
that when respondents meet in person a wide range of group
key protocols agree with current respondents’ practices.
To collect information about how respondents meet and
later communicate, we asked our respondents the following
initial questions.
• Do you meet people in person, and then communicate with
them online afterwards? (Add them to your IM list, Add
them as a Friend on Facebook, etc. Send them an email.)
• After meeting new people in a group situation, how often do
you only contact one person versus contact several people
from a group situation?
96% of our respondents answered “yes” to the ﬁrst question.
This is not surprising, as our survey recruitment was done
largely over the Internet, and we did expect our respondents
to use the Internet to communicate. We are not sure how to
account for the remaining 4% – perhaps it is survey noise
or they only communicate in real-life with their real-life
friends and have a separate category for online friends, and
there is no overlap between these two categories.
To determine how often users meet in groups we asked the
following question.
