Hi,
Use-case:
  1. I have a directive which performs my custom componetns search via ContentChildren
  2. I have multiple re-usable container components
  3. I want to use "search" directive in the template of these components
Here is plunker with STR:
  1. Open plunker
  2. Open browser's console
  3. "dump inputs from container" dumps the result of "search" directive. Directive was used in container's component template. Array will be empty (reproduction of the issue)
  4. At the same time "dump inputs from app" dumps 3 existing input components. Directive was used for container in app's template
