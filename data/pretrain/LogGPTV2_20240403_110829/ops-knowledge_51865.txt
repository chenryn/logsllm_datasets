Question: "A developer is working on a legacy application that must run on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems. Which of the following statements accurately reflects the implications of these system architectures on the application's memory address space?"
 "A": "On a 32-bit system, the application will have an address space of \(2^{64}\) bytes."
 "B": "On a 64-bit system, the address space will be significantly larger than that of a 32-bit system, accommodating \(2^{64}\) bytes."
 "C": "The 32-bit and 64-bit systems will provide the same address space, facilitating compatibility between the architectures."
 "D": "The application will not run on a 64-bit system due to the incompatibility in address space size."
Answer: B
