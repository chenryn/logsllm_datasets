User: How to protect system security and avoid being attacked by hackers?
Assistant: Here are some ways to secure your system to help avoid being hacked: 1. Install anti-virus software and a firewall, and keep these software up-to-date. This prevents most viruses and malware attacks. 2. Operating systems and applications must be upgraded in a timely manner to ensure that security holes are patched. 3. Avoid opening emails or links from unknown sources. Do not visit untrustworthy websites or download untrustworthy software. 4. Create different, strong passwords for all important accounts (such as email, banking, and cloud storage) and change them regularly. 5. Restrict access to the system. Authorize only the right users, and set strong passwords for each user. Enabling two-factor authentication on your system is also a good option. 6. Protect critical data. Important data should be encrypted and stored in a secure location. Back up your data in case of data loss or attack. 7. Monitor the system regularly to detect unusual activity. Install an intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system. 8. Staff training. Train employees on how to recognize social engineering attacks and other security threats. Continuing to educate employees to help increase their awareness of information security protection. 9. Formulate a strict policy for company information security, including data security, access control, password policy, remote work policy, etc., to ensure that the policy complies with the latest security standards and regulations.
