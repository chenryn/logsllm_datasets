User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Out of memory at 72% usage I've a problem currently with my 48gb ram server: it ramdomly kills processes because of Out of Memory, even if it only uses 72% of it (I got this figure from my monitoring interface). (swap usage: 60%)

I have investigated a bit, but could not really find what is going wrong. 

I'm currently trying to "read" the syslog to find if indeed my memory usage was 72%, but can't find the relevant info. Also, do you guys see anything that could help me in my investigation ?

Thanks

Thanks

Assistant: The answer to your question is you are using more memory than 72%. You can calculate it via the OOM Report.

The bit that tells you what the state of the memory was is this bit:

In linux, memory is split into zones which are regions of physical RAM allotted (usually by address range) to serve a particular purpose.

DMA is for very old hardware which in could only address a small region in DMA. This zone does not accumulate for much memory and is rarely -if ever- used.
DMA32 is a zone reserved for hardware which can only address 32 bits of memory. This is used in 64bit systems for that particular class of hardware. Normally cover about 4G of memory (can be less though).

The vast majority of memory however gets allocated to the 'Normal' zone. Nearly all memory goes in and out of here. Its used when there is not special purpose markers against the memory being allocated. When memory in this zone gets tough to find, the kernel typically starts using memory in other zones to find it (although I believe DMA never gets touched).

Based off of your logs, the following calculation can be made.

 DMA Present + DMA32 Present + Normal Present = Total available memory
 15968kB     + 3644928kB     + 46661632kB     = 50322528kB
-
 DMA Free    + DMA32 Free    + Normal Free    = Total free memory
 15884kB     + 181176kB      + 25892kB        = 222952kB
=
 Total available memory - Total free memory = Total Used Memory
 50322528kB             - 222952kB          = 50099576kB
=
 (Total used memory / Total available memory) * 100 = Total used percent
 50099576kB         / 50322528kB              * 100 = 99.55%


Other zones can in effect be free of memory but still you get an OOM because the zone you want is not free.

OOM killer is a possible means to free memory when the min value is greater than the free value. If you check your Normal zone you can see that this is the case here.

Your biggest memory consumers are mysql and java. Either retune them to alter their memory usage, or get more memory for them.
