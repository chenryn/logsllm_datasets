performance of our adversary against the best performing one
class, and two class classiﬁers from their original study.
There were a couple of differences as compared to the

protocol for selecting training and test samples for the reasons
explained in section IV A. But the EER results in Table V are
in the same range as the ones reported in the original study
[4].
We tested the Targeted K-means++ adversary and Mas-
terKey on this authentication system. The adversaries could be
applied without any change as they operate on the vectors of
feature values. Since the Indiscriminate K-means++ adversary
was clearly based on speciﬁc properties of keystroke dynamics,
it could not be applied to this dataset.
As can be seen by Table V, and Figure 4, the results on
this dataset show the same trends as seen in the keystroke
dynamics datasets before. The ﬁrst try which hits the mean
of the impostor samples is not very successful here. This is
particularly bad for an adversary like MasterKey which stays
around the mean of the distribution, and is reﬂected in the
results in Table V. But the K-means++ adversary is quickly
able to explore the sample space to ﬁnd more challenging
queries - and in 10 tries itself, breaks into a sizeable proportion

V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Behavioral biometrics is a promising ﬁeld of research, but it
is not a reliable solution for authentication in its current state.
We proposed two adversarial agents that require a different
amount of effort from the adversary. Both attack methods
performed clearly better than the previously studied attack
methods in the literature and show that current state of the art
classiﬁers add little protection against such adversaries. In the
case of Indiscriminate K-means++, more than its success rate,
it is worrying for the keystroke dynamics systems that such an
adversary could conduct its attack without any additional cost
incurred to collect samples. Past research has focused much
more on improving the classiﬁers against naive adversaries, but
this work shows that a lot more research from the adversarial
perspective is required before such authentication systems can
be adopted in sensitive contexts.
The design of our K-means++ adversaries utilizes a com-
mon intuition about human behavior, which is that a person’s
behavioral data belongs to a “cluster”, rather than being
absolutely unique. Thus it is natural to expect such techniques
to generalize to other types of behavioral data. The results on
the touchscreen touchscreen swipes dataset also supports this
claim.
Of course, from a practical perspective, it is much harder to
simulate an attack on a touchscreen based system, as opposed
to a keystroke dynamics system, because of the diversity of
the touchscreen features like pressure, ﬁnger size and so on.
Unlike keystrokes - we can’t just write an easily automated
script to carry out such an attack. This implies that a swipes
based classiﬁer is more secure for now. But given enough
motivation, it is possible that methods could be devised to
bypass such limitations. For instance, such attacks could be
Previous research has relied exclusively on the average
Equal Error Rate scores across all subjects to measure the
robustness of classiﬁers. To develop more robust behavioral
biometric classiﬁers, it would be useful to benchmark against
the adversarial agents proposed in this paper instead. For
instance, one class classiﬁers have been the dominant method
researched in the keystroke dynamics literature as they perform
as well as the two class classiﬁers in terms of EER, while
the two class classiﬁers are not practical because one can
not expect
impostor samples for arbitrary passwords. Yet,
against both the adversarial algorithms, the two class classiﬁers
performed clearly better than the one class classiﬁers. This
suggests that a future direction of research would be to bridge
the gap between the idealized and practical versions of such
two class classiﬁers as explained in section IV A.
From the adversarial perspective, one possibility for future
work would be to extend these methods to free text based
classiﬁers. Free text classiﬁers utilize a continuous stream of
input text, as opposed to ﬁxed text passwords, in order to
classify keystroke patterns. This leads to differences in the
features and algorithms that are utilized for these classiﬁers.
But conceptually,
the Indiscriminate K-means++ adversary
should be well suited to generate adversarial samples against
free text classiﬁers as well.
