through  a  Checkpoint  firewall,  whose  alert  reporting  mechanism  is  wrapped  to  for-
ward INFOSEC alerts to the M-Correlator.
Within this experimental LAN, there is one mission-critical server, Solarium, which

Port_list                       ::=  ‘[‘  {} ‘]’

                                                  [] ‘:’ [ Host_specifier]
operates as a fileserver for the rest of the network, and one mission-critical SGI HTTP
server.    There  are  two  administrative  accounts  for  this  LAN,  em_admin1  and
em_admin2,  and  three  untrusted  consultant  accounts  that  the  administrators  want  to
monitor closely.   A highly sensitive and valuable source code directory is located on
host Solomon.   With respect to administrative responsibilities, the analyst in this case
study  is  most  concerned  with  rapidly  responding  to  potential  subversion  of  system
control, through either privilege theft or modification of the systems themselves.  The
analyst is also concerned with attacks against users, but to a lesser extent than system-
directed attacks that may have direct impact on the security of all user accounts.   The
analyst,  who  is  responsible  for  maintaining  availability  and  watching  for  suspicious
probes  and  behaviors,  feels  that  at  this  time  alerts  of  these  types  should  receive  a
slightly lower priority than direct attacks on the system and its users. Table 2 provides
an example mission specification based on the experimental LAN in Figure 4.
The top left quadrant defines the list of host and network services that are critical to
the mission of the example network.  The middle left quadrant enumerates both criti-
cal user accounts and critical host files or directories.  The syntax for critical asset and
resource specifications is as follows:
The right quadrant defines the analyst’s level  of  interest  in  the  various  classes  of
security alerts.  In this scenario, the analyst is primarily concerned with direct threats
of  privilege  and  access  violations,  while  being  much  less  concerned  with  issues  of
probes, availability, and other nonspecific suspicious activity. In addition, the interest
profile allows the analyst to define a minimum anomaly score from anomaly reporting
services  and  minimum  confidence  scores  provided  by  probability-based  intrusion
detection services, such as those described in [21].
4.1   A Basic Rank Scenario
Table 3 is an incident-ranking scenario that demonstrates the concepts of Section 3,
based  on  the  sample  environment  presented  in  Section  4.    In  this  example,  four
INFOSEC devices (EMERALD eXpert-Net, eXpert-BSM, Checkpoint Firewall-1, and
ISS  RealSecure)  contribute  to  a  stream  of  eleven  independent  security  incidents.
Based on the sample mission profile defined in Section 4, the incident column entries
that are recognized as high interest are listed in bold, and column entries of medium
interest are underlined.   Critical servers and untrusted source users, as defined in the
sample mission profile, are also listed in bold.

The  Active  Port  and  OS/Architecture  columns  identify  contributions  of  the  rele-
vance  scores.    “Yes”  in  the  Active  Port  and  OS/Architecture  columns  indicates  that
the dependent network services, operating system, and hardware required for the suc-
cessful execution of the given alert were indeed found to be present and enabled on
the target machine.
Table 4 illustrates the view of the Table 3 dataset from the perspective of the inci-
dent rank calculation process, and the resulting ranking produced by M-Correlator (1
represents  the  highest  threat  ranking  and  11  represents  the  lowest  threat  ranking).
Alerts of highest threat share the property that their combined contributing elements
are of high priority, relevance, and positive outcome.

4.2   A Multi-sensor Alert Scenario
As  a  further  example  of  incident  ranking  in  combination  with  M-Correlator’s  alert
clustering  algorithm,  the  following  is  a  multi-INFOSEC  device  alert  scenario.    Like
the basic scenario, this scenario is based on the experimental environment discussed in
Section 4.  Table 5 provides a sampling of alerts produced from five INFOSEC de-
vices  distributed  in  the  M-Correlator  experimental  LAN:    EMERALD  eBayes-TCP
and eXpert-Net network intrusion detection sensors, Checkpoint Firewall-1, ISS Real-
secure, and eXpert-BSM.
In this scenario, 79 alerts are forwarded to M-Correlator for analysis and database
storage.  Table  5  shows  the  time  at  which  each  INFOSEC  alert  was  generated,  the
INFOSEC device that generated the alert, the alert type, the source and destination of
the  attack,  and  alert  outcome  and  relevance  calculation.    The  alert  is  identified  as
relevant if M-Correlator was able to confirm that at least one of the alert dependencies
in the relevance calculation was found to match.  The alert is identified as nonrelevant
if no alert dependencies are found to match, and N/A indicates that the relevance cal-

culation  could  not  be  performed  because  of  lack  of  information  from  the  incident-
handling fact base or regarding the target host.  Bold text is used in Table 5 to indicate
that  the  value  represents  a  critical  item  in  the  sample  mission  specification  of  Sec-
tion 4.
Table 4.  Basic Experiment Incident Rank Resolution
Table 6 presents the alert stream represented in Table 5 ranked and aggregated by
the M-Correlator prototype.  In this example, Table 5’s 79 original INFOSEC alerts
were processed by M-Correlator and stored in an Oracle database.  The security inci-
dents shown in Table 6 were merged and ranked as follows:
1.  Entry 1:  This incident represents the three EMERALD eXpert-BSM reports of
malicious activity from  the  same  user  session.    The  aggregate  priority  of  these
alerts was high because this incident included a high-interest privilege subversion
attack on the critical fileserver, Solarium.  The attacks were also successful, and
all were found relevant to the target machine.
2.  Entry 2:  The second-highest-ranked incident represents ISS Realsecure’s Intel-
Buffer-Overflow  and  EMERALD  eXpert-Net’s  Imapd-Overflow  alerts.    These
alerts both shared the common alert class privilege-subversion and common net-
110
P.A. Porras, M.W. Fong, and A. Valdes
work session attributes.   While this security incident was registered in the mis-
sion  specification  as  high  interest,  and  found  both  successful  and  relevant,  the
alert was performed against a lower-interest target host.
3.  Entry  3:    The  M-Correlator  used  its  alert  clustering  algorithm  to  merge  the
eBayes-TCP Port-Scan alert with the Checkpoint Firewall Connection-Violation
alerts.  These alerts pertain to the same source and target addresses, and share a
common alert cluster tag called Generic-Probe.   The alerts are ranked low be-
cause of the analyst’s low interest in probing activity, and because the alert did
not target a critical asset or resource.
4.  Entry  4:  The  lowest-ranked  security  incident  is  a  Realsecure  Kerberos-User-
Snarf  probe.    This  alert  represents  a  distinct  security  incident,  was  evaluated
overall as low interest because the attack targeted a noncritical asset, and appar-
ently represented a false alarm, as there is no Kerberos server present on the tar-
get machine.
4.3   Operational Exposures
In  recent  months  the  EMERALD  development  group  has  begun  operational  experi-
ments with M-Correlator on operational data sets provided my multiple organizations
inside the United States Department of Defense.
5   Related Research
The broad problem of information security alert management and post-sensor analysis
is an area that has been undergoing a great deal of activity.   In the commercial space,
one issue receiving particular attention is that of sensor overload through alert fusion
and better methods for visualization.  Some systems offer a form of severity measure-
ment that attempts to prioritize alerts.  However, unlike M-Correlator, which attempts
to  formulate  a  security  incident  ranking  based  on  a  multi-attribute  mission  profile
specification,  the  vast  majority  of  severity  metric  services  rely  on  hard-coded  map-
pings of attributes to fixed severity indexes.
There is also a growing momentum of research activity to explore intrusion report
correlation as a separable layer of analysis above intrusion detection.   In the space of
alert aggregation and false positive reduction there are a number of ongoing projects.
These include work by Honeywell, which is developing Argus, a qualitative Bayesian
estimation  technology  to  combine  results  from  multiple  intrusion  detection  systems
[9].    The  work  to  date  has  emphasized  false-positive  reduction  through  a  priori  as-
sessments  of  sensor  reporting  behavior.    M-Correlator  also  attempts  to  reduce  false
positives, but through an emphasis on the relevance of an alert to the target system’s
configuration.
A Mission-Impact-Based Approach to INFOSEC Alarm Correlationˆ

Table 5.  Cross Sensor Incident Rank and Aggregation Dataset
IBM Zurich [7] is also exploring common attribute-based alert aggregation in the
Tivoli Enterprise Console, as are Columbia University and Georgia-Tech using asso-
ciation  rules  [12].    Onera  Toulouse  is  using  an  expert-system-based  approach  for
similarity  formulation  [5],  and  SRI  International  is  using  a  probabilistic-based  ap-
proach  to  attribute  similarity  recognition  [22].    M-Correlator’s  alert  clustering  algo-
rithm is very similar in purpose and outcome to these systems as it, too, attempts to
perform alert fusion in the presence of incident type disagreement, feature omission,
and competing incident clustering opportunities.
Another  major  thrust  of  activity  involves  the  development  of  complex  (or  multi-
stage)  attack  modeling  systems,  capable  of  recognizing  multistage  (or  multi-event)
attack scenarios within the stream of distributed intrusion detection sensors.  Stanford
has developed extensions to its ongoing research in Complex Event Processing  (CEP)
in the domain of intrusion report correlation [18].  In this work, complex multistage
scenarios  can  be  represented  in  concept  abstraction  hierarchies  using  the  CEP  lan-
guage.  This approach provides methods for efficient event summarization and com-
plex pattern recognition.  The Stanford work differs significantly from M-Correlation
in  that  it  emphasizes  scenario  recognition  and  content  summarization,  whereas  M-
Correlation emphasizes impact analysis, where the impact  is  defined  with  respect  to
112
P.A. Porras, M.W. Fong, and A. Valdes
the  mission  objectives  of  the  target  network.    In  addition,  IET  Incorporated  is  in-
volved  in  research  to  develop  situation-aware  visualization  software  for  managing
security information and recognizing  composite  attack  models  [1].    There  is  an  em-
phasis on large-scale attack recognition using a probabilistic domain-modeling algo-
rithm.    The  effort  differs  significantly  from  M-Correlation  in  that  it  too  emphasizes
model recognition.  Finally, UC Santa Barbara’s STAT-based web of sensors work is
exploring the use of the STATL language as a basis for complex attack modeling [8].
Table 6.  Ranked and Aggregated Security Incidents
6   Conclusion
We have discussed a mission-impact-based approach to alert prioritization and aggre-
gation.    This  research  has  led  to  the  development  of  a  prototype  system  called  the
EMERALD M-Correlator, which is capable of receiving security alert reports from a
variety of INFOSEC devices.  Once  translated  to  an  internal  incident  report  format,
INFOSEC alerts are augmented, and, where possible, fused together through a chain
of processing.  A relevance score is produced through a comparison of the alert tar-
get’s  known  topology  against  the  vulnerability  requirements  of  the  incident  type,
which is provided to M-Correlator by an Incident Handling Fact Base.  Next, a prior-
ity  calculation is performed per alert to indicate (a) the degree  to  which  the  alert  is
targeted at critical assets, and (b) the amount of interest the user has registered for this
alert type.  Last, an overall  incident  rank is assigned to each alert,  which  brings  to-
gether the priority of the alert with the likelihood of success.
Once ranked, the M-Correlator attempts to combine related incident alarms with an
attribute-based  alert  clustering  algorithm.    The  resulting  correlated  incident  stream
A Mission-Impact-Based Approach to INFOSEC Alarm Correlationˆ
113
represents  a  filtered,  lower-volume,  content-rich  security-incident  stream,  with  an
incident-ranking  scheme  that  allows  the  analyst  to  identify  those  incidents  that  pose
the greatest risk to the monitored network.
M-Correlator has reached a maturity level where trial releases of the system have
occurred  in  several  computing  environments  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense.
These analyses have included live testing in a DoD Information Warfare exercise, as
well as multiple batch analyses of INFOSEC alert streams from several DoD organi-
zations.  These activities are contributing to the process of validating the efficacy of
mission-based correlation, as well as providing valuable insight into future extensions
of the incident rank model.  We believe that mission-impact based analyses will prove
themselves extremely useful both to human analysts, and to other consumers, such as
automated  response  technology  that  must  sift  through  thousands  of  alerts  daily  in
search of alarms worthy of proactive response.  Extension of the basic M-Correlator
algorithm is already underway to incorporate its logic into a real-time response engine.
