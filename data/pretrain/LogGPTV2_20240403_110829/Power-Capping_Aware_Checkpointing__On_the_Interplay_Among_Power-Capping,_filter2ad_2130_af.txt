at petascale and exascale under different power caps (a), and
execution time curves under different power capping levels
with OCIs for power aware model and prior model without
power capping awareness (b).
for each power cap in the ﬁgure. Notice that α−
t are on same
vertical line because power cap unaware OCI stays the same.
On the other hand, as the power cap is reduced the curves
shift upward due to increased execution time, and the curve
shifts towards the right due to increasing MTBF. Therefore, α+
t
increases as the power cap decreases due to change in MTBF.
Prior models can not take this effect into account and lead to
suboptimal OCI estimation. This explains why and how the
power capping aware model outperforms the prior models in
different situations.
Finding 7: As the system scale increases, the beneﬁt of
power capping aware OCI model also increases signiﬁcantly
compared to the prior models.
Next, we show that it is critical to choose the correct
to achieve minimum execution time and
power cap level
energy consumption. Fig. 10(a) shows the best performance
is achieved when power cap is 50 watts, and the lowest
energy consumption is achieved when power cap is 45 watts.
This illustrates that the optimal power capping level itself
depends upon the metric of optimization (e.g., performance,
and energy). We also point out that the corresponding OCI on
these power capping levels would be different as well, this can
be obtained via our model. Note that this result includes the
failure events, checkpointing, and restart phase.
(a) Optimal checkpointing interval
(b) No checkpointing
Fig. 10: Total execution time and energy consumption under
various power caps with the optimal checkpointing interval (a),
and when checkpointing overhead is ignored (b).
On the other hand, the results in Fig. 10(b) do not take
failures, checkpoint, and restart into account. Interestingly, in
this case the lowest execution time is achieved with power
cap of 60 watt, and least energy consumption is observed
for power cap of 35 watts when we do not consider failures,
checkpoint, and restart. This is a critical ﬁnding that illustrates
that optimal power cap levels can not alone be decided by
how power capping affects the application in isolation, without
taking failures, checkpointing, and restart phase into account.
These shifts in optimal power caps are caused by the impact of
power capping on MTBF. We ﬁnd that using 45 watt power cap
instead of 35 watt power cap leads to 20.2% savings in energy
consumption. Note that this reduction in energy consumption
is between power-unaware model based OCI at 35 watt and
power-aware model based OCI at 45 watts. Similarly, using 50
watt power cap instead of 60 watt power cap leads to 12.6%
reduction in execution time.
Finding 8: The optimal power cap levels for minimizing
execution time and energy consumption are different and
so are their corresponding OCIs. The optimal power cap
levels for minimizing execution time and energy consumption
change once failures, checkpoint, and restart phases are taken
into account. The corresponding difference in execution time
and energy consumption is signiﬁcant. Our results also show
that power capping aware OCI model leads to signiﬁcant
improvements.
