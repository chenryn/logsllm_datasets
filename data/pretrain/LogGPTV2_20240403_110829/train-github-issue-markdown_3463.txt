I'm trying to use angular2 as a JSPM package.  
When I'm doing something like  
`import {bootstrap, Component, Input} from 'angular2/angular2';`  
in my code then typescript complains that it can't find the definitions and I
don't get any code completions.
The workaround is to install angular2 also as a npm package and set
moduleResolution to node. However this seems not optimal, because now I have
two dependencies whose versions need to be aligned.
I guess tsc could resolve the modules for jspm/systemjs similar to how it
already can do it for node. E.g. look up package.json, config.js and use the
pathes from there the locate to type definitions inside the jspm_packages
folder.
Not really sure if this is covered by #5039 and #5728.
