provider.
VIII. LIMITATIONS
Exit bridges aim to circumvent server-side discrimination
against Tor trafﬁc by making it more difﬁcult to determine
that a given trafﬁc ﬂow traversed through the Tor network.
4The Menlo Report focuses on the ethics of computer security research.
While the above paragraph considers the ethics of deploying exit bridges
(and not on performing research), we believe the principles laid in the report
are applicable here too.
However, services can still prevent the use of exit bridges by
blocking all trafﬁc that originates from cloud service providers.
As discussed above, doing so could also block (i) users
who either proxy or originate their trafﬁc from cloud service
providers and (ii) automated systems (e.g., web crawlers) that
operate from the cloud service provider.
Rather than identify exit bridge trafﬁc by IP, a site could
attempt to detect the use of the Tor Browser via browser
ﬁngerprinting [18]. The Tor Browser is not intended to be
a covert application. By design, it attempts to reduce the
entropy of an individual user’s browser ﬁngerprint [32, 39]
by making all Tor Browsers look identical—but not identical
to other browsers. A determined website administrator can
likely identify the Tor Browser with high accuracy. However,
this requires the administrator to (i) include Javascript that
performs measurements of the browser and (ii) add website
logic to assess the measurements and produce a browser
ﬁngerprint. This requires making webpages larger and slower
to load. We are skeptical that website operators would be
willing to accept such tradeoffs.
Lastly, it is unclear that website operators would even want
to disallow Tor Browser users if their goal is to eliminate
attacks arriving from Tor. Attackers who use Tor to perform
vulnerability scanning or send malicious content likely do not
use the Tor Browser and instead attach their scripts and tools
directly to the Tor client (e.g., via torsocks). We posit that Tor
users who use the Tor Browser are much more likely to be
non-malicious.
IX. CONCLUSION
This paper highlights the growing threat of server-side
blocking of Tor trafﬁc, and introduces the exit bridge ar-
chitecture to counter such censorship efforts. Ephemeral exit
bridges are difﬁcult to block since they are short-lived and
their network locations are largely indistinguishable from other
cloud-based services (including those used by website users
who do not use Tor). Our experiments show that exit bridges
effectively circumvent server-side efforts to block Tor with a
very modest 14.5% increase in latency relative to normal Tor
usage. Additionally, based on current cloud service provider
pricing models, exit bridges are inexpensive and cost under
$0.01 per bridge per hour. Our implementation is available
as free open-source software and can be downloaded at
https://security.cs.georgetown.edu/tor-exit-bridges.
