User: The number of users of a certain website has increased sharply, resulting in an excessively high number of concurrent connections to the server. It is necessary to optimize the configuration of Nginx to relieve the pressure on the server.
Assistant: First, consider increasing the number of Nginx worker processes to improve concurrent processing capabilities. You can add the following content in the Nginx configuration file: worker_processes 4; worker_connections 1024; Among them, worker_processes indicates the number of worker processes of Nginx, which can be adjusted according to the number of CPU cores of the server. Generally, it is recommended to set it to twice the number of CPU cores of the server. worker_connections indicates the maximum number of concurrent connections for each worker process, which can be adjusted according to the bandwidth and hardware configuration of the server. In addition, you can consider using Nginx's reverse proxy to share the load of the server. You can store static resources such as pictures, CSS, etc. on the CDN, let the CDN handle requests for static resources, and use Nginx to reverse proxy requests for dynamic pages, and distribute the requests to multiple servers for processing. Next, you can consider optimizing the Nginx cache to reduce the load on the server. The pressure on the server can be relieved by increasing the hit ratio of the cache. Nginx's cache can be enabled through the following configuration: http { proxy_cache_path /path/to/cache levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m; server { ... location / { proxy_pass http://backend; # open Cache proxy_cache my_cache; # Cache validity period proxy_cache_valid 200 60m; # When the cache hit rate is low, discard the cache proxy_cache_bypass $http_pragma; proxy_cache_revalidate on; } } } Finally, you can consider using Nginx's current limiting module to control the server load. Traffic-limiting policies can be set according to the server's hardware configuration and user traffic, such as limiting the access frequency of each IP, limiting the number of concurrent requests for the entire website, and so on. The above are some common Nginx optimization strategies, which need to be adjusted according to the actual situation.
