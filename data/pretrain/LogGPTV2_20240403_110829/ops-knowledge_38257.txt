User: I just finished installing the latest stable version of python via Homebrew.
$ brew install python3
Everything works fine. I would like to install packages, for example PyMongo. 
I don't have pip.
$ pip
-bash: pip: command not found
and there is no Homebrew formulae for it:
$ brew install PyMongo
brew install PyMongo
Error: No available formula for pymongo
Searching formulae...
Searching taps...
Any idea what's the best way to install PyMongo on OS X when Python was installed via Homebrew. Thank you!
Assistant: Use pip3. The "caveats" text you see when you run brew info python3 was printed for you after python3 was installed; that text is frequently helpful! It reads:

You can install Python packages with
pip3 install <package>
They will install into the site-package directory
/usr/local/lib/python3.4/site-packages
