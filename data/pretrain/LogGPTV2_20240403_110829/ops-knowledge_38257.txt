I recently installed the latest stable version of Python using Homebrew with the following command:
```sh
$ brew install python3
```
Everything seems to be working fine. However, I need to install additional packages, such as PyMongo, and I noticed that `pip` is not available:
```sh
$ pip
-bash: pip: command not found
```
Additionally, there is no Homebrew formula for PyMongo:
```sh
$ brew install PyMongo
Error: No available formula for pymongo
Searching formulae...
Searching taps...
```
Could you please advise on the best way to install PyMongo on macOS when Python was installed via Homebrew? Thank you!

**Solution:**
You should use `pip3` to install Python packages. The "caveats" section displayed after installing Python with Homebrew provides this information. You can install PyMongo using the following command:
```sh
$ pip3 install pymongo
```
This will install the package into the site-packages directory, typically located at:
```
/usr/local/lib/python3.x/site-packages
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
