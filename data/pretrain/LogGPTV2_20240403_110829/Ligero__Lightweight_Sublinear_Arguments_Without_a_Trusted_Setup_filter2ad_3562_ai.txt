A GENERALIZED INTERLEAVED CODE
TESTING
In this section we present a generalized version of the testing algo-
rithm that uses σ linear combinations to amplify soundness. This
algorithm is useful for obtaining better soundness over small (cid:27)elds.
Generalized-Test-Interleaved(F, L[n, k, d], m, t, σ; U)
• Oracle: A purported Lm-codeword U . Depending on the con-
text, we may view U either as a matrix in Fm×n in which each
row is a purported L-codeword, or as a sequence of n symbols
(U1, . . . , Un), Ui ∈ Fm.
– Probing parameter t  e. Then, for a random w∗ in the row-span of U ∗, we
have
m
Pr[d(w
∗
, L) ≤ e] ≤ (e + 1)/|F|σ .
Theorem A.1. Let e be a positive integer such that e  e. Then, for arbitrary u(cid:48) ∈ Fn and a random w∗ in the
row-span of U ∗, we have Pr[d(w∗, L) ≤ e] ≤ (e + 1)/|F|.
Theorem B.1. Let e be a positive integer such that e  e. Then, for arbitrary u(cid:48)
σ ∈ Fn and a random
w∗ in the row-span of U ∗, we have Pr[∀ h ∈ [σ], d(w∗ + u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤
e] ≤ (e + 1)/|F|σ .
Proof: The proof of Lemma C.2 is almost identical to the proof of
Lemma 4.2. The high level reason why the same argument works
is that the decomposition w∗ = αv∗ + x where x is independent
of α still holds even for w∗ + u(cid:48)
is a (cid:27)xed vector, and so
u(cid:48)
h
+ x is independent of α). We provide the full proof below.
Let L∗ be the row-span of U ∗. We consider two cases similar to
h
our proof of Lemma 4.2.
Case 1: There exists v∗ ∈ L∗ such that d(v∗, L) > 2e. In this case,
we show that
(since u(cid:48)
h
(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e] ≤ 1/|F|σ .
w∗∈R L∗[∀ h ∈ [σ], d(w
can be written uniquely as U ∗
i
be the ith row of U ∗ and let Ei = ∆(U ∗
(2)
Indeed, using a basis for L∗ that includes v∗, a random w∗ ∈ L∗
can be written as αv∗ + x, where α ∈R F and x is distributed
independently of α. We argue that conditioned on any choice of x,
there can be at most one choice of α such that d(αv∗ +x +u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e.
We can conclude the case from this as the probability over r1, . . . , rh
that d((rh)T U + u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e holds for every h is at most 1/|F|σ .
This follows by observing that if d(αv∗ + x0 + u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e and
d(α(cid:48)v∗ + x0 + u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e for α (cid:44) α(cid:48), then by the triangle inequality
we have d((α − α(cid:48))v∗, L) ≤ 2e. Since, by assumption d(v∗, L) > 2e
and this implies d(v∗, L) > 2e, we arrive at a contradiction.
Case 2: For every v∗ ∈ L∗, d(v∗, L) ≤ 2e. We show that in this
case Prw∗∈R L∗[∀ h ∈ [σ], d(w∗ + u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e] ≤ (e + 1)/|F|σ . Let
U ∗
i , L). Note that, since
2e  e, we have |E| > e. We show below that for
j ∈ E, except with 1/|F| probability over a random choice of w∗
from L∗, either j ∈ ∆(w∗ + u(cid:48)
h, L) > e. First, we
conclude the case and the proof of Lemma assuming this holds. We
observe that this implies that with probability at most 1/|F|σ over
the choice of r1, . . . , rσ , it holds that, for all h, j (cid:60) ∆((rh)T U +u(cid:48)
h, L)
and d((rh)T U +u(cid:48)
h, L) ≤ e. Taking a union bound over the (cid:27)rst e +1
elements of E the claim follows.
Suppose j ∈ Ei and (cid:27)x an arbitrary h ∈ [σ]. As before, we write
w∗ = αU ∗
+ x for α ∈R F and x distributed independently of α.

We show that |Bj| ≤ 1. Suppose for contradiction that there are
two distinct α, α(cid:48) ∈ F such that for z = αU ∗
+ x0 + uh and z(cid:48) =
+ x0 + uh we have d(z, L) ≤ e, d(z(cid:48), L) ≤ e, j (cid:60) ∆(z, L), and

j (cid:60) ∆(z(cid:48), L). Since d > 4e, for any z∗ in the linear span of z and z(cid:48)
i
we have j (cid:60) ∆(z∗, L). Since (α − α(cid:48))U ∗
= z − z(cid:48) is in this linear span,
we have j (cid:60) ∆(U ∗

Theorem C.1. Let e be a positive integer such that e < d/4. Sup-
pose d(U ∗, Lm) ≥ e. Then, for arbitrary u(cid:48)
σ ∈ F and any
malicious P strategy, the oracle U ∗ is rejected by V except with
≤ (1 − e/n)t + (e + 1)/|F|σ probability.
