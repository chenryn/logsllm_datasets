Right now, the beanAttributes group contains all the possible attributes used
for a bean definition. However, namespaces that extend it, cannot reuse
specific attributes and need to redefine them.  
It would be nice to make the attributes global (while preserving the group) so
that other NS can reuse their definitions.
