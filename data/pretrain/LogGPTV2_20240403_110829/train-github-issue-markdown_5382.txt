    [X] bug report
    [ ] feature request
    [ ] support request
**Current behavior**  
Let's suppose we have to following modules:
    AppModule
      -> imports FeatureModule
         -> import SubFeatureModule
`FeatureModule` has routes definitions
`SubFeatureModule` has component and router guard (resolve). Component
declares its resolves via static field (to keep it in one place)
So `FeatureModule` declares a route, that lands to the component from
`SubFeatureModule` and resolves given guard.
In runtime (browser-dynamic) everything works as expected. But when we compile
with angular-compiler, among imports a duplicate entry appears for resolver,
and it has wrong path.
Although, resolution via static fields in AoT in other cases works fine, I
could not figure out why it fails in this case.
