User: Please explain what is a load balancing algorithm and several common algorithm models.
Assistant: Load balancing refers to the distribution of requests among multiple servers to balance the load of each server and improve the reliability, stability and availability of the system. The load balancing algorithm is a method of distributing load in a distributed system. Several common algorithm models are as follows: 1. Round-robin algorithm: distribute requests in a round-robin manner, and each request is assigned to a different server in turn. 2. Random algorithm: Randomly select a server to process requests, which can evenly distribute requests, but does not guarantee the load balance of each server. 3. Weighted round-robin algorithm: Each server sets a different weight value, and distributes requests according to the weight value. Requests can be distributed according to service capabilities, but it may not be able to balance the load. 4. Algorithm of the least number of connections: Select the server with the least number of current connections to process the request, which can ensure the load balance of each server, but the number of connections needs to be counted, and some requests may take a long time to process. 5. IP address hash algorithm: Hash calculation is performed according to the requested IP address, and the request is allocated to the selected server, which can balance the load, but the good performance of the hash function needs to be guaranteed. 6. Dynamic adjustment algorithm: According to the real-time resource usage of the server, the load balancing strategy can be adjusted to dynamically adapt to load changes, but real-time monitoring of the system status is required.
