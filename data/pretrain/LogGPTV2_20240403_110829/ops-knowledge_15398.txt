User: How to set the SSH access restriction of a Linux server, allowing only users with specified IP addresses to log in?
Assistant: To set the SSH access restriction of the Linux server, only allow users with specified IP addresses to log in, you can follow the steps below: 1. Open the SSH configuration file: `sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config` 2. Find the following two lines and cancel them Comment (remove the # at the beginning of the line): ``` #ListenAddress 0.0.0.0 #PermitRootLogin yes ``` 3. In order to allow only users with the specified IP address to log in, you need to add the following line: ``` AllowUsers username@ip_address ``` Among them, `username` is the username you want to allow to log in, `ip_address` is the IP address that the user is allowed to log in, and you can use the wildcard `*` to represent all IP addresses. If you need to allow multiple users to log in, you can add a user and IP address on each line. 4. Save and close the file. 5. Restart the SSH service: `sudo service ssh restart` In this way, SSH access restrictions are set, and only users with specified IP addresses are allowed to log in. Please note that after setting such access restrictions, you need to ensure that only the corresponding users can access the server, otherwise the access restrictions may be too strict, resulting in failure to log in.
