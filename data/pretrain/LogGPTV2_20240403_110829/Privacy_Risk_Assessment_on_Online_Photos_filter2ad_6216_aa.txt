**Abstract:**
With the increasing popularity of cameras and the growing desire to share photos, a vast number of images are now posted online. Digital photos often contain extensive metadata that can reveal more information than what is visually depicted. Once published, this metadata can pose significant privacy risks to the photo owners. This study aims to raise public awareness about these risks and assess the policies adopted by online media sites for handling metadata in hosted photos. We analyzed nearly 100,000 photos from over 600 top-ranked websites across seven categories and found that the photo handling policies vary significantly depending on the site's category. Our findings also demonstrate that seemingly trivial metadata can be used to launch real-world attacks against photo owners.

## 1. Introduction
The proliferation of cameras, particularly smartphone cameras, has made it extremely convenient for people to take and share photos online. Every day, around 1.6 million photos are shared on Flickr, one of the largest photo-sharing platforms. However, in their eagerness to share, well-intentioned users often expose hidden metadata, which can include sensitive information such as camera serial numbers. This metadata, while seemingly innocuous, can pose privacy threats to both the photographer and the subjects in the photos. Unfortunately, up to 40% of high-degree participants in one study were unaware of the term "metadata," exacerbating the issue.

During the dissemination of digital photos, online social networks (OSNs) and other media sites often serve as repositories. These sites may compress, resize, or remove metadata from uploaded photos. For example, Instagram resizes all photos to 640x640 pixels and automatically adjusts larger images. Users, however, are often unaware of how their photos are handled by these services. Therefore, it is crucial to raise public awareness about the potential privacy risks associated with metadata leakage and to inform users about the practices of online media sites.

Based on the lifecycle and propagation process, we classify digital photos into three stages: "fresh," "intact," and "wild." "Fresh" photos are newly taken and unaltered. "Intact" photos have been uploaded but remain unchanged from the hosting site. "Wild" photos may have undergone multiple post-processing actions by the hosting sites. In this paper, we conduct a data-driven assessment of privacy risks in contemporary digital photos, examining the metadata and potential risks at each stage, and exploring the photo handling policies of online media sites.

To obtain a representative dataset, we collected nearly 200,000 photos through various methods, including crowdsourcing, downloading original-sized photos from a major sharing site, and crawling "wild" photos from Google Images and over 600 top-ranked websites. We analyzed the metadata in these photos and found that metadata was prevalent at each stage. Specifically, about 10% of "fresh" photos contained GPS coordinates, while 27%-37% of "intact" photos and only about 1% of "wild" photos had GPS information. We also measured the presence of other sensitive metadata, such as the photographer's name and modification history.

To understand how photos are processed after being shared, we investigated the photo handling policies of 679 unique top sites across seven categories: "social networking," "news," "weblog," "college," "government," "shopping," and "classified" sites. We found that the policies varied by category, with "college" and "government" sites rarely resizing or removing metadata, while other categories were more likely to do so.

In addition to sensitive metadata, we demonstrated that seemingly trivial metadata could be exploited to re-identify photo owners. For 62.6% of unique photographers, we were able to uncover both their online and real-world identities using just one photo they had posted online.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides background knowledge. Sections 3, 4, and 5 examine "fresh," "intact," and "wild" photos, respectively, and investigate online sites' photo handling policies. Section 6 demonstrates the re-identification attack. Section 7 discusses the limitations and future work. Section 8 surveys related work, and Section 9 concludes the paper.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Metadata Information in a Photo
Digital photos typically contain metadata from three standards: EXIF, XMP, and IPTC. Table 1 lists the common metadata fields grouped by category.

### 2.2 Potential Privacy Concerns Arising from Photo Metadata
While most metadata fields may seem innocuous, some can raise serious privacy concerns. Key sensitive fields include geolocation, photographer's/owner's information, and modification history.

### 2.3 Three Stages of Digital Photos
Based on their propagation process, digital photos can be classified into three stages: "fresh," "intact," and "wild."

## 3. Fresh Photos
### 3.1 Data Collection
Collecting "fresh" photos is challenging due to their inherent characteristics. We used crowdsourcing to gather 782 photos, filtering out 170 that were either post-processed or created by other tools. The remaining 612 photos were used for our study.

### 3.2 Characterizing "Fresh" Photos
#### Demographics
The 612 photos were collected from 612 unique workers from 76 countries. Table 3 provides demographic statistics.

#### (Sensitive) Metadata Prevalence
Table 1 lists the metadata fields typically included in a photo. Our analysis found that metadata was prevalent among "fresh" photos, with about 10% containing GPS coordinates.
