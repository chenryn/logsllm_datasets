Abstract. With the rising popularity of cameras and people’s increas-
ing desire to share photos, an overwhelming number of photos have been
posted all over the Web. A digital photo usually contains much infor-
mation in its metadata. Once published online, a photo could disclose
much more information beyond what is visually depicted in the photo and
what the owner expects to share. The metadata contained in digital pho-
tos could pose signiﬁcant privacy threats to their owners. Our work aims
to raise public awareness of privacy risks resulting from sharing photos
online and subsequent photo handling conducted by contemporary media
sites. To this end, we investigated the prevalence of metadata informa-
tion among digital photos and assessed the potential privacy risks arising
from the metadata information. We also studied the policies adopted by
online media sites on handling the metadata information embedded in
the photos they host. We examined nearly 100,000 photos collected from
over 600 top-ranked websites in seven categories and found that the photo
handling policy adopted by a site largely varies depending on the cat-
egory of the site. We demonstrated that some trivial looking metadata
information suﬃces to mount real-world attacks against photo owners.
1 Introduction
With the proliferation of cameras, especially smartphone cameras, it is now very
convenient for people to take photos whenever and wherever possible. Further-
more, the prevalence of online social networks and photo-sharing sites greatly
facilitates people to share their digital photos with friends online. Every day,
around 1.6 million photos are shared on Flickr [1], one of the largest online
photo sharing sites. In their rush to share digital photos online, well-intentioned
Internet users unwittingly expose much hidden metadata information contained
in the digital photos. The metadata information such as camera serial number
may seem relatively innocent and trivial but could pose privacy threats to pho-
tographers1 and the people depicted in the photo. Unfortunately, one study [14]
shows that up to 40 % of high-degree participants do not even know the term
1 By photographer we mean the person who took the photo rather than who works as
a professional photographer.

metadata. The situation becomes worse concerning the fact that a photo could
linger on the Web for many years.
During the spread of a digital photo, online social network (OSN) services
and other media sites usually serve as the sink. Online media sites often compress
and resize the photos they host for space saving. For instance, Instagram uses a
resolution of 640*640 pixels for all its photos and automatically resizes any larger
photos. Media sites may even remove the metadata information in their hosted
photos. However, users usually do not know what online services will do with
their uploaded photos [14]. Thus, it is important to raise public awareness of the
potential privacy risks posed by metadata leakage and increase their knowledge
of how online media sites handle the photos they upload.
Based on the life cycle and the propagation process, we create a taxonomy to
classify digital photos into three diﬀerent stages: “fresh,” “intact,” and “wild.”
“Fresh” photos are just freshly taken with a camera. “Intact” photos have been
uploaded online but remain intact from the hosting sites. “Wild” photos may
have been post-processed multiple times by the hosting sites. In this paper, we
perform a data-driven assessment of privacy risks on contemporary digital pho-
tos. Speciﬁcally, we examine digital photos at the three stages in terms of meta-
data information contained and potential privacy risks, and we further explore
the photo handling policies adopted by online media sites.
To obtain a representative dataset for our study, we collected nearly 200,000
photos in total in various ways including soliciting freshly taken photos through
crowdsourcing, downloading original sized, intact photos from a major photo
sharing site, and crawling “wild” photos from Google Images and over 600 top
ranked websites. We examined the metadata information embedded in these
photos and found that metadata was prevalent among photos at each of the
three stages. We paid special attention to the metadata ﬁelds that may give
rise to great privacy concerns. We found that about 10 % of “fresh” photos
were tagged with GPS coordinates while 27 %–37 % of “intact” photos and only
about 1 % of “wild” photos contained GPS information. We also measured the
percentages of photos containing other sensitive metadata information including
a photographer’s name and modiﬁcation history.
To understand how a photo is processed after being shared online, we also
investigated online sites’ policies on handling photos based on 97,664 photos
crawled from 679 unique top sites in seven categories—“social networking,”
“news,” “weblog,” “college,” “government,” “shopping,” and “classiﬁed”2 sites.
We found that photo handling policies adopted by online sites vary with diﬀerent
categories. The “college” and “government” sites hardly resize the photos they
host or remove the embedded metadata information. However, the sites in the
other categories are more likely to resize the photos and remove the metadata
information.
In addition to the sensitive metadata information embedded in a photo, we
demonstrated that some other trivial looking metadata information could be
exploited to launch re-identiﬁcation attacks against photo owners. For 62.6 % of

unique photographers, we were able to uncover their both online and real-world
identities with just one photo they ever took and posted online.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We provide background
knowledge in Sect. 2. We describe data collection methods for “fresh” photos
and characterize them in Sect. 3. We examine “intact” photos in Sect. 4. We
characterize “wild” photos and investigate online sites’ photo handling policies
in Sect. 5. We demonstrate the re-identiﬁcation attack in Sect. 6. We discuss the
limitation of this work and propose our future work in Sect. 7. We survey the
related work in Sect. 8 and conclude the paper in Sect. 9.
2 Background
In this section, we ﬁrst give an overview of the metadata information typically
contained in a digital photo, then discuss the potential privacy concerns, and
ﬁnally illustrate the three stages we deﬁne for digital photos.
2.1 Metadata Information in a Photo
There are three most commonly used metadata standards for photos: EXIF,
XMP, and IPTC. They often coexist in a photo and constitute the main part
of the photo metadata. Table 1 lists the metadata ﬁelds typically included in a
photo grouped by category.
A digital photo typically contains ample metadata information. When a shot
is taken, the camera automatically embeds into the photo all the information it
knows about the camera itself and the photo. In addition, users can add their
own descriptive information with image processing software. Speciﬁcally, typical
metadata information can be summarized as follows: (1) when – when the photo
is created and modiﬁed if applicable, (2) where – the exact location (GPS coordi-
nates and altitude) at which the photo is captured if a GPS receiver is equipped
430

and enabled, or coarse-grained location information such as city/state/country,
(3) how – the camera device used, its make, model, serial number, light circum-
stances (sunny or cloudy, ﬂash on or oﬀ), exposure (auto or manual), and all
other parameters used, (4) who – the photographer and the people depicted in
the photo if manually added during post processing, (5) what – title, headline,
caption, keywords, copyright restriction, and other detailed descriptions added
for logging, organization or copyright protection, and (6) modiﬁcation – if the
photo is modiﬁed, on what date and time, by what software on what computer,
and the speciﬁc actions done to the photo.
2.2 Potential Privacy Concerns Arising from Photo Metadata
Most metadata ﬁelds may look innocent and trivial. However, some could raise
serious privacy concerns. We highlight several sensitive metadata ﬁelds below.
Geolocation. Contemporary cameras and smartphones are typically equipped
with GPS functions. When taking photos with these GPS-enabled devices, geolo-
cation information is automatically saved into the metadata. For a photo posted
online, anybody able to access it could check the metadata information and may
get the geolocation where the photo was taken. This deﬁnitely violates the pri-
vacy of the photographer and the people depicted. For instance, the time and
location embedded in an online photo indicated that a public ﬁgure had been at
an embarrassing location and not where he claimed to have been [5]. Moreover, a
geo-located photo obviously taken at home and depicting high-value goods may
give burglars incentives. In addition, young parents usually like to post many
photos of their kids online, which may raise great concerns because the photos
tagged with GPS coordinates could disclose the exact locations of where their
kids live, play, or study.
Photographer’s/Owner’s Information. Some photos explicitly contain in
the metadata the photographers’ information, among which the name informa-
tion is most commonly seen. No matter whether such information is embedded
with or without the photographers’ awareness, disclosing such information may
cause identity leakage, especially given the availability of geolocation information
in the metadata.
Modiﬁcation History. When post processing a digital photo, an image process-
ing software like Adobe Photoshop and Apple iPhoto often automatically embeds
into the photo the detailed modiﬁcation information, represented by three meta-
data ﬁelds: History When, History Software, and History Parameters. Table 2
presents an example of the embedded modiﬁcation information in a photo. For
the convenience of illustration, we add the photo’s shot time in the table. It
clearly shows that the photo has been processed twice in less than one month
since it was taken on July 16, 2014. And two versions of Adobe Photoshop on
one or two Macintosh computers were ever used for format conversion and save
actions.
A photographer may not want to disclose such modiﬁcation information,
especially when such information may undermine what the photographer tries

to convey through the photo. For instance, the contained modiﬁcation informa-
tion may cast doubt on the legitimacy of a photo used as digital photographic
evidence in court. In addition, celebrities may not like the public to know the
photos they were depicted in are actually photoshopped.
2.3 Three Stages of Digital Photos
Based on their propagation process, contemporary digital photos fall into three
stages: “fresh,” “intact,” and “wild.” In the “fresh” stage, a photo is freshly
taken, free from any post-processing manipulations and still stored in the local
camera device. All the metadata information contained in a “fresh” photo is
automatically embedded by the camera device, instead of being subsequently
introduced by a post processing. In the “intact” stage, a photo has been uploaded
online, but remains intact and has not yet been compressed or resized by the
hosting media site. For a photo in the “wild” stage, it may have undergone
resizing, cropping, and other editing actions conducted by the hosting site, which
could change the hidden metadata too. By characterizing digital photos in these
three diﬀerent stages, we aim to depict the status of contemporary digital photos.
3 Fresh Photos
The photos in the “fresh” stage are just freshly created. We examine the meta-
data information, especially sensitive information, embedded in those freshly
taken photos. In this section, we ﬁrst describe the method used for collecting
“fresh” photos and then characterize the collected photos.
3.1 Data Collection
The collection of “fresh” photos is not easy due to their inherent characteristics.
We found that it is an eﬀective way to solicit “fresh” photos through crowdsourc-
ing. We posted tasks on a crowdsourcing platform. In each task, the required
actions for a worker to take are two-fold: (1) pick up her smartphone, take a
photo, and then send the photo to us directly via the instrumented email client
application, and (2) take a short survey asking for her demographics informa-
tion. In addition, to guarantee the unique origin of each photo, each worker is
allowed to take our task only once.

For each received photo, we employed various methods to check if it is freshly
taken with a smartphone rather than a photo randomly grabbed from the Inter-
net. In addition, according to our tests, sending a photo via email does not
aﬀect its embedded metadata. Thus, our task requirements guarantee that the
collected photos are freshly created and intact from any post-processing manip-
ulation. The data collection lasts for two months and we collected 782 photos
in total. We ﬁltered out 170 photos that are either post-processed or created
by other tools. We use the set of the remaining 612 photos for our study. We
address potential ethical concerns on our data collection in Appendix A.
3.2 Characterizing “Fresh” Photos
Demographics. The 612 photos were collected from 612 unique workers from
76 countries. Table 3 lists the demographic statistics of the worker participants:
(1) 71.7 % of workers were male and the rest were female, (2) 45.5 % of workers
were from the top ﬁve countries, including India, United States, Serbia, Nepal,
and Macedonia, (3) 82.1 % of workers were between the ages of 18–34 and 10.8 %
between 35–44, (4) 47 % of workers received the bachelor’s degree, 33.3 % with
high school degree, and 17.7 % with graduate degree, and (5) 72.8 % of photos
were taken with Android phones and 18.2 % with iOS phones.
