titleblackhat:us-19 Detecting Malicious Files with YARA Rules as They Traverse the Network
YARA, the pattern matching swiss knife for malware researchers, has been extremely useful at detecting suspicious files on the endpoint. However, little or no information is publicly available on how to leverage this useful tool to scan for files as they are traversing the network. In this presentation, I will show how you can open source Zeek IDS (formerly bro) and how some custom developed scripts can be used to extract files from the network and identify attacks on an early stage before it causes more damage. Scanning for YARA files on the network has the benefit of increased performance, as compared to scanning several gigabytes or terabytes on the endpoint, as well as target specific mime types, used for malware delivery. Additionally, Zeek IDS can provide additional context whenever a YARA rule is triggered, that will provide defenders with more information to act more rapidly.
