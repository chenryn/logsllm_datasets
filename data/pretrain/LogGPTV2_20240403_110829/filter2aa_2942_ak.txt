### NIST SP 800-161r1: Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations

#### Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity
This document, available free of charge from [https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1](https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-161r1), provides comprehensive guidance on cybersecurity supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) practices for systems and organizations. It aligns with Executive Order 14028, which aims to improve the nation’s cybersecurity.

#### Glossary and Definitions
- **Supply Chain Cybersecurity Risk Information**: Defined in the glossary based on the Federal Acquisition Supply Chain Security Act (FASCSA) definition.

#### Access Control (AC) Controls

**AC-6: Least Privilege**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Ensure that non-enterprise users (e.g., independent consultants, suppliers, developers, system integrators, external service providers) do not have privileged access to enterprise supply chain information. Use least privilege mechanisms to define access parameters, including duration, frequency, methods, and user identity. Identify critical and non-critical components to guide access control.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AC-17: Remote Access**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Implement secure remote access mechanisms, allowing only vetted personnel to access the supply chain. Limit remote access to specified business hours, geographic locations, and through secure means like a VPN and multi-factor authentication. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AC-18: Wireless Access**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Define and implement secure wireless access controls for supply chain logistics, such as RFID support and software call home features. Ensure protection of information systems, components, and logistics technologies during transit.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

**AC-19: Access Control for Mobile Devices**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Define and implement access control mechanisms for mobile devices used in the supply chain. This includes tracking, logistics, and data management. Implement access controls for associated data and metadata.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AC-20: Use of External Systems**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Monitor and audit access to the supply chain from external systems, such as those of suppliers, developers, and service providers. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

**AC-21: Information Sharing**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Manage information sharing within the supply chain to ensure it is accessible only to authorized individuals. Define boundaries for information sharing and monitor for unintentional or intentional sharing.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2

**AC-22: Publicly Accessible Content**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Review and control the release of publicly accessible content related to the supply chain, such as Requests for Information and delivery information.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AC-23: Data Mining Protection**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Implement data mining protection as part of insider threat activities. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AC-24: Access Control Decisions**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Assign and manage access control decisions to support authorized access to the supply chain. Ensure consistency in access control requirements and implementation, especially when using system integrators or external service providers.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

#### Awareness and Training (AT) Controls

**AT-1: Policy and Procedures**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Designate an official to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of training policies and procedures, including C-SCRM. Integrate C-SCRM into security training and awareness policies.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2

**AT-2: Literacy Training and Awareness**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Provide practical exercises, insider threat recognition, social engineering, suspicious communications, APT, and cyber threat environment training. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 2

**AT-3: Role-Based Training**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Provide role-based training for personnel involved in the acquisition process, threat assessments, counterintelligence, and secure development practices. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 2

**AT-4: Training Records**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Maintain documentation for C-SCRM-specific training, especially for key personnel in acquisitions and counterintelligence.
- **Level(s)**: 2

#### Audit and Accountability (AU) Controls

**AU-1: Policy and Procedures**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Designate an official to manage the development, documentation, and dissemination of audit and accountability policies and procedures, including auditing of the supply chain information systems and network.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

**AU-2: Event Logging**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Identify and log auditable events in the information system or supply chain network. Ensure logs are traceable and verifiable. Require prime contractors to implement and flow down this requirement to sub-tier contractors.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

**AU-3: Content of Audit Records**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Securely handle and maintain audit records, conforming to record retention requirements and preserving the integrity and confidentiality of the records.
- **Level(s)**: 1, 2, 3

**AU-6: Audit Review, Analysis, and Reporting**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Filter and correlate audit records for analysis and reporting. Adjust the level of audit record review based on risk changes. Contracts should address how audit findings will be reported and adjudicated.
- **Level(s)**: 2, 3

**AU-10: Non-Repudiation**
- **Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance**: Implement non-repudiation techniques to protect the originality and integrity of information systems and the supply chain network. Examples include supply chain metadata, communication, and delivery acceptance information.
- **Level(s)**: 3
