LEAST PRIVILEGE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: For C-SCRM supplemental guidance, see control enhancements. 
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with 
Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
Control Enhancement(s): 
LEAST PRIVILEGE | PRIVILEGED ACCESS BY NON-ORGANIZATIONAL USERS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that protections are in place to prevent 
non-enterprise users from having privileged access to enterprise supply chain and related supply chain 
information. When enterprise users include independent consultants, suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers, relevant 
access requirements may need to use least privilege mechanisms to precisely define what information 
and/or components are accessible, for what duration, at what frequency, using what access methods, 
and by whom. Understanding what components are critical and non-critical can aid in understanding 
the level of detail that may need to be defined regarding least privilege access for non-enterprise users.   
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-17 REMOTE ACCESS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Ever more frequently, supply chains are accessed remotely. Whether for 
the purpose of development, maintenance, or the operation of information systems, enterprises should 
implement secure remote access mechanisms and allow remote access only to vetted personnel. Remote 
access to an enterprise’s supply chain (including distributed software development environments) should be 
limited to the enterprise or contractor personnel and only if and as required to perform their tasks. Remote 
access requirements – such using a secure VPN, employing multi-factor authentication, or limiting access 
to specified business hours or from specified geographic locations – must be properly defined in 
agreements. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to 
implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s):  
REMOTE ACCESS | PROTECTION OF MECHANISM INFORMATION  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should ensure that detailed requirements are properly 
defined and that access to information regarding the information system and supply chain is protected 
from unauthorized use and disclosure. Since supply chain data and metadata disclosure or access can 
have significant implications for an enterprise’s mission processes, appropriate measures must be taken 
to vet both the supply chain and personnel processes to ensure that adequate protections are 
implemented. Ensure that remote access to such information is included in requirements.

AC-18 WIRELESS ACCESS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: An enterprise’s supply chain may include wireless infrastructure that 
supports supply chain logistics (e.g., radio-frequency identification device [RFID] support, software call 
home features). Supply chain systems/components traverse the supply chain as they are moved from one 
location to another, whether within the enterprise’s own environment or during delivery from system 
integrators or suppliers. Ensuring that appropriate and secure access mechanisms are in place within this 
supply chain enables the protection of the information systems and components, as well as logistics 
technologies and metadata used during shipping (e.g., within tracking sensors). The enterprise should 
explicitly define appropriate wireless access control mechanisms for the supply chain in policy and 
implement appropriate mechanisms. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
AC-19 ACCESS CONTROL FOR MOBILE DEVICES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The use of mobile devices (e.g., laptops, tablets, e-readers, smartphones, 
smartwatches) has become common in the supply chain. They are used in direct support of an enterprise’s 
operations, as well as tracking, supply chain logistics, data as information systems, and components that 
traverse enterprise or systems integrator supply chains. Ensure that access control mechanisms are clearly 
defined and implemented where relevant when managing enterprise supply chain components. An example 
of such an implementation includes access control mechanisms implemented for use with remote handheld 
units in RFID for tracking components that traverse the supply chain. Access control mechanisms should 
also be implemented on any associated data and metadata tied to the devices.  
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-20 USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises’ external information systems include those of suppliers, 
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service 
providers. Unlike in an acquirer’s internal enterprise where direct and continuous monitoring is possible, in 
the external supplier relationship, information may be shared on an as-needed basis and should be 
articulated in an agreement. Access to the supply chain from such external information systems should be 
monitored and audited. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and 
flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s):  
USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | LIMITS ON AUTHORIZED USE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: This enhancement helps limit exposure of the supply chain to the 
systems of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
USE OF EXTERNAL SYSTEMS | NON-ORGANIZATIONALLY OWNED SYSTEMS — RESTRICTED USE 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Devices that do not belong to the enterprise (e.g., bring your own 
device [BYOD] policies) increase the enterprise’s exposure to cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain. This includes devices used by suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system

service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers. Enterprises should review the use of 
non-enterprise devices by non-enterprise personnel and make a risk-based decision as to whether it will 
allow the use of such devices or furnish devices. Enterprises should furnish devices to those non-
enterprise personnel who present unacceptable levels of risk. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-21 INFORMATION SHARING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Sharing information within the supply chain can help manage 
cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. This information may include vulnerabilities, threats, the 
criticality of systems and components, or delivery information. This information sharing should be 
carefully managed to ensure that the information is only accessible to authorized individuals within the 
enterprise’s supply chain. Enterprises should clearly define boundaries for information sharing with respect 
to temporal, informational, contractual, security, access, system, and other requirements. Enterprises should 
monitor and review for unintentional or intentional information sharing within its supply chain activities, 
including information sharing with suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service 
providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers.  
Level(s): 1, 2 
AC-22 PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CONTENT 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Within the C-SCRM context, publicly accessible content may include 
Requests for Information, Requests for Proposal, or information about delivery of systems and components. 
This information should be reviewed to ensure that only appropriate content is released for public 
consumption, whether alone or with other information. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-23 DATA MINING PROTECTION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this 
control as part of their insider threat activities and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier 
contractors. 
Level(s): 2, 3 
AC-24  ACCESS CONTROL DECISIONS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should assign access control decisions to support authorized 
access to the supply chain. Ensure that if a system integrator or external service provider is used, there is 
consistency in access control decision requirements and how the requirements are implemented. This may 
require defining such requirements in service-level agreements, in many cases as part of the upfront 
relationship established between the enterprise and system integrator or the enterprise and external service 
provider. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.

FAMILY: AWARENESS AND TRAINING  
[FIPS 200] specifies the Awareness and Training minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) ensure that managers and users of organizational information 
systems are made aware of the security risks associated with their activities and of the 
applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, instructions, 
regulations, or procedures related to the security of organizational information systems; 
and (ii) ensure that organizational personnel are adequately trained to carry out their 
assigned information security-related duties and responsibilities.  
This document expands the Awareness and Training control of [FIPS 200] to include C-SCRM. 
Making the workforce aware of C-SCRM concerns is key to a successful C-SCRM strategy. C-
SCRM awareness and training provides understanding of the problem space and the appropriate 
processes and controls that can help mitigate cybersecurity risks throughout the supply chain. 
Enterprises should provide C-SCRM awareness and training to individuals at all levels within the 
enterprise, including information security, procurement, enterprise risk management, 
engineering, software development, IT, legal, HR, and others. Enterprises should also work with 
suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-
related service providers to ensure that the personnel who interact with an enterprise’s supply 
chains receive C-SCRM awareness and training, as appropriate. 
AT-1 
POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should designate a specific official to manage the 
development, documentation, and dissemination of the training policy and procedures, including C-SCRM 
and role-based specific training for those with supply chain responsibilities. Enterprises should integrate 
cybersecurity supply chain risk management training and awareness into the security training and 
awareness policy. C-SCRM training should target both the enterprise and its contractors. The policy should 
ensure that supply chain cybersecurity role-based training is required for those individuals or functions that 
touch or impact the supply chain, such as the information system owner, acquisition, supply chain logistics, 
system engineering, program management, IT, quality, and incident response. 
C-SCRM training procedures should address: 
a. 
Roles throughout the supply chain and system/element life cycle to limit the opportunities and 
means available to individuals performing these roles that could result in adverse consequences, 
b. Requirements for interaction between an enterprise’s personnel and individuals not employed by 
the enterprise who participate in the supply chain throughout the SDLC, and 
c. 
Incorporating feedback and lessons learned from C-SCRM activities into the C-SCRM training.

Control Enhancements: 
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | PRACTICAL EXERCISES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should provide practical exercises in literacy training 
that simulate supply chain cybersecurity events and incidents. Enterprises should require their prime 
contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-level contractors. 
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | INSIDER THREAT   
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should provide literacy training on recognizing and 
reporting potential indicators of insider threat within the supply chain. Enterprises should require their 
prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier 
contractors. 
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | SOCIAL ENGINEERING AND MINING   
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should provide literacy training on recognizing and 
reporting potential and actual instances of supply chain-related social engineering and social mining. 
Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this 
requirement to relevant sub-level contractors. 
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | SUSPICIOUS COMMUNICATIONS AND ANOMALOUS 
SYSTEM BEHAVIOR   
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Provide literacy training on recognizing suspicious communications 
or anomalous behavior in enterprise supply chain systems. Enterprises should require their prime 
contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-level contractors. 
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT   
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Provide literacy training on recognizing suspicious communications 
on an advanced persistent threat (APT) in the enterprise’s supply chain. Enterprises should require 
their prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-level 
contractors.  
LITERACY TRAINING AND AWARENESS | CYBER THREAT ENVIRONMENT    
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Provide literacy training on cyber threats specific to the enterprise’s 
supply chain environment. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this control 
and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-level contractors.  
Level(s): 2 
AT-3 
ROLE-BASED TRAINING  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Addressing cyber supply chain risks throughout the acquisition process 
is essential to performing C-SCRM effectively. Personnel who are part of the acquisition workforce require 
training on what C-SCRM requirements, clauses, and evaluation factors are necessary to include when 
conducting procurement and how to incorporate C-SCRM into each acquisition phase. Similar enhanced 
training requirements should be tailored for personnel responsible for conducting threat assessments. 
Responding to threats and identified risks requires training in counterintelligence awareness and reporting. 
Enterprises should ensure that developers receive training on secure development practices as well as the 
use of vulnerability scanning tools. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this 
control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should

refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with Executive Order 14028, Improving the 
Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
Control Enhancement(s): 
SECURITY TRAINING | PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS  
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: C-SCRM is impacted by a number of physical security mechanisms 
and procedures within the supply chain, such as manufacturing, shipping, receiving, physical access to 
facilities, inventory management, and warehousing. Enterprise and system integrator personnel who 
provide development and operational support to the enterprise should receive training on how to 
handle these physical security mechanisms and on the associated cybersecurity risks throughout the 
supply chain.  
Level(s): 2 
ROLE-BASED TRAINING | COUNTERINTELLIGENCE TRAINING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Public sector enterprises should provide specialized 
counterintelligence awareness training that enables its resources to collect, interpret, and act upon a 
range of data sources that may signal a foreign adversary’s presence in the supply chain. At a 
minimum, counterintelligence training should cover known red flags, key information sharing 
concepts, and reporting requirements.

FAMILY: AUDIT AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
[FIPS 200] specifies the Audit and Accountability minimum security requirement as follows: 
Organizations must: (i) create, protect, and retain information system audit records to 
the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of 
unlawful, unauthorized, or inappropriate information system activity; and (ii) ensure 
that the actions of individual information system users can be uniquely traced to those 
users so they can be held accountable for their actions.  
Audit and accountability controls for C-SCRM provide information that is useful in the event of 
a supply chain cybersecurity incident or compromise. Enterprises should ensure that they 
designate and audit cybersecurity supply chain-relevant events within their information system 
boundaries using appropriate audit mechanisms (e.g., system logs, Intrusion Detection System 
[IDS] logs, firewall logs, paper reports, forms, clipboard checklists, digital records). These audit 
mechanisms should also be configured to work within a reasonable time frame, as defined by 
enterprise policy. Enterprises may encourage their system suppliers, developers, system 
integrators, external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers to do 
the same and may include requirements for such monitoring in agreements. However, enterprises 
should not deploy audit mechanisms on systems outside of their enterprise boundary, including 
those of suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other 
ICT/OT-related service providers. 
AU-1 
 POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises must designate a specific official to manage the 
development, documentation, and dissemination of the audit and accountability policy and procedures to 
include auditing of the supply chain information systems and network. The audit and accountability policy 
and procedures should appropriately address tracking activities and their availability for other various 
supply chain activities, such as configuration management. Suppliers, developers, system integrators, 
external system service providers, and other ICT/OT-related service providers activities should not be 
included in such a policy unless those functions are performed within the acquirer’s supply chain 
information systems and network. Audit and accountability policy procedures should appropriately address 
supplier audits as a way to examine the quality of a particular supplier and the risk they present to the 
enterprise and the enterprise’s supply chain. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
AU-2 
EVENT LOGGING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: An observable occurrence within the information system or supply 
chain network should be identified as a supply chain auditable event based on the enterprise’s SDLC 
context and requirements. Auditable events may include software/hardware changes, failed attempts to 
access supply chain information systems, or the movement of source code. Information on such events 
should be captured by appropriate audit mechanisms and be traceable and verifiable. Information captured 
may include the type of event, date/time, length, and the frequency of occurrence. Among other things, 
auditing may help detect misuse of the supply chain information systems or network caused by insider 
threats. Logs are a key resource when identifying operational trends and long-term problems. As such, 
enterprises should incorporate reviewing logs at the contract renewal point for vendors to determine 
whether there is a systemic problem. Enterprises should require their prime contractors to implement this 
control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors. Departments and agencies should

CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The audit records of a supply chain event should be securely handled 
and maintained in a manner that conforms to record retention requirements and preserves the integrity of 
the findings and the confidentiality of the record information and its sources as appropriate. In certain 
instances, such records may be used in administrative or legal proceedings. Enterprises should require their 
prime contractors to implement this control and flow down this requirement to relevant sub-tier contractors.  
Departments and agencies should refer to Appendix F to implement this guidance in accordance with 
Executive Order 14028, Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity. 
Level(s): 1, 2, 3 
AU-6  
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: The enterprise should ensure that both supply chain and information 
security auditable events are appropriately filtered and correlated for analysis and reporting. For example, if 
new maintenance or a patch upgrade is recognized to have an invalid digital signature, the identification of 
the patch arrival qualifies as a supply chain auditable event, while an invalid signature is an information 
security auditable event. The combination of these two events may provide information valuable to C-
SCRM. The enterprise should adjust the level of audit record review based on the risk changes (e.g., active 
threat intel, risk profile) on a specific vendor. Contracts should explicitly address how audit findings will be 
reported and adjudicated.   
Level(s): 2, 3 
Control Enhancement(s):  
AUDIT REVIEW, ANALYSIS, AND REPORTING | CORRELATION WITH INFORMATION FROM NONTECHNICAL 
SOURCES 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: In a C-SCRM context, non-technical sources include changes to the 
enterprise’s security or operational policy, changes to the procurement or contracting processes, and 
notifications from suppliers, developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and 
other ICT/OT-related service providers regarding plans to update, enhance, patch, or retire/dispose of a 
system/component.  
Level(s): 3 
AU-10 NON-REPUDIATION 
Supplemental C-SCRM Guidance: Enterprises should implement non-repudiation techniques to protect the 
originality and integrity of both information systems and the supply chain network. Examples of what may 
require non-repudiation include supply chain metadata that describes the components, supply chain 
communication, and delivery acceptance information. For information systems, examples may include 
patch or maintenance upgrades for software as well as component replacements in a large hardware system. 
Verifying that such components originate from the OEM is part of non-repudiation.
