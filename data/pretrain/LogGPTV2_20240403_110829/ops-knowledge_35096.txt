User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题HowTo rewrite subdomain to apache userdir As described in this blog  I want to rewrite internally

http://xy.user.phpfarm.lan -&gt; http://user.phpfarm.lan/~xy/


Module userdir is enabled.

With the following Apache2 vhost config file, it has got a bug:

/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/phpfarm:

&lt;Virtualhost *:80&gt;
 ServerAdmin root@localhost
 ServerName em-sv-phpfarm.lan
 ServerAlias *.user.phpfarm.lan user.phpfarm.lan phpfarm.lan

 DocumentRoot /var/www/
 &lt;Directory /&gt;
  Options FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;Directory /var/www&gt;
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
  AllowOverride None
  Order allow,deny
  allow from all
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

 ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

 # Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
 # alert, emerg.
 LogLevel warn

 CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined

 RewriteLog "/tmp/rewrites"
 RewriteLogLevel 5
 # Uncomment the above two lines and watch /tmp for some debug info.

 RewriteEngine On

 # Make bob.user.phpfarm.em.lan be treated as user.phpfarm.lan/~bob
 RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ([^.]+)\.user\.phpfarm\.lan$ [NC]
 # In the above line make sure you escape (preceed with a backslash) every period (.) in the address.
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^[^/]+/~.*$
 # exclude file handler
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/php-fcgi/.*$
 RewriteRule ^/([^~]+) /~%1/$1 [PT,L]
&lt;/virtualhost&gt;



http://xy.user.phpfarm.lan lists an index of /var/www, but it should list an index of /home/xy/public_html, that is wrong
http://xy.user.phpfarm.lan/testfile shows the content of /home/xy/public_html/testfile, that is correct!


So I think an empty REQUEST_URI isn't captured correctly. But I can't find the bug. Does anybody know, why?

Assistant: Try replacing the last line with


 RewriteRule ^/([^~]*) /~%1/$1 [PT,L]


You were insisting on at least one character after the slash, so cases where REQUEST_URI was / were being ignored.
