**Current behavior**
User can type letter "e" in input type="number" fields and any value
containing one or many letters "e" is considered valid. Also, having letters
"e" in input breaks pattern validation.
**Expected behavior**  
I assume it is possible to use _exponential notation_ in number inputs, but
the value still should be tested as a valid number, and pattern validation
still should be applied.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
http://plnkr.co/edit/1aQRuixe6f9bzN0Wf2RU?p=preview
  1. Try to type "eeeeeeeeee". This is considered a valid number
  2. Try to type "123456". Pattern validation works as intended and the field is invalid
  3. Now add letter 'e' : "123456e". The field is now considered valid
  4. Conclusion: Letter 'e' is not taken in account for number validation and breaks pattern validation.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
This is a silent failure in the validation process of number inputs, that
currently needs to be manually adressed with input event handlers.
