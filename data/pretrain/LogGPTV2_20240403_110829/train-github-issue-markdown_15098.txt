If HTML elements such as `<br>` are placed between the `div` items in a carousel, the `.next` class is incorrectly added to these elements instead of the next `.item` `div`.

When the "next" action is triggered, the `.next` CSS class should be applied to the subsequent `.item` `div`.

To ensure proper functionality, the carousel logic should be adjusted so that the `.next` class is always added to the next `.item` `div`, regardless of any intervening HTML elements.
