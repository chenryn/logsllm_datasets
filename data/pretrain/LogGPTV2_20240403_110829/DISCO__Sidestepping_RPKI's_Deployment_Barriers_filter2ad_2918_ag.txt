process. The safest course of action is to go through the
IETF/IRTF to request a BGP attribute (IANA does issue tem-
porary allocations). However, even a BGP attribute allocation
from IANA is not a guarantee of disruption-free deployments,
as implementations may be using the attribute for other ends
or mishandle it.
INFERRING NETWORKS USING DEFAULT ROUTES
APPENDIX A
We used measurements to identify ASes using default
routes. To do so, we kept a /24 preﬁx in PEERING address
space permanently withdrawn and issued traceroutes from our
set of RIPE Atlas vantage points to the withdrawn preﬁx. If
the network hosting the probe does not have default route, it
will drop the packets, and the traceroute will terminate. If the
network does have a default route, the traceroute packets can
be forwarded along the default route until they reach a router
in a network that does not have a default route. We infer that a
network has a default route if the traceroute reaches (at least)
a router outside that network. Although the coverage of this
approach is limited to ASes at the beginning of routes from
the selected RIPE Atlas probes toward PEERING, it overlaps
exactly with the traceroute measurements used in our analysis
of DISCO, which we measured from the same set of RIPE
Atlas vantage points.
We identify 768 RIPE Atlas probes hosted in networks
using default routes, and a total of 941 networks using default
routes (some traceroutes traverse multiple ASes using default
routes). Figure 8 shows the distribution of the customer cone
sizes of ASes using default routes, and the distribution of
customer cone sizes of the ASes where these default routes
terminate. As observed in previous work [12], we ﬁnd that
most cases are small networks employing default routes toward
larger provider networks.
Fig. 8. Characterization of ASes inferred to be using default routes.
APPENDIX B
EXPERIMENTING WITH BGP IN THE WILD
We did not repeat the experiments in §VII-A for multiple
reasons: (1) we anticipate that the qualitative results would
remain very similar, even if the exact numbers would change;
(2) there is a chance of a small number of operators not
applying the FRR patch; (3) while we have safely tested
against multiple routers and conﬁgurations in a controlled
environment (including the patched FRR), we cannot know
the full set of conﬁgurations and deployments that exist in the
world to test against, and (4) new router bugs may have been
introduced since the last experiment and be triggered by a new
experiment.
Our experiments and recent experience with BGP large
communities indicate that extending BGP is a slow, iterative
