## Abstract
We analyze the existing literature on social cybersecurity and present a structured overview based on its relevance to four key security and privacy (S&P) behaviors: (1) negotiating access to shared resources, (2) shared and social authentication, (3) managing self-presentation, and (4) influencing others' S&P behaviors. We further categorize these domains into four scales of social distance—intimate, personal, social, and public—highlighting how desired access control policies, authentication methods, and privacy and sharing preferences vary across these scales. We evaluate the current landscape through the lens of Ackerman’s social-technical gap in social computing systems, finding that while social behaviors significantly impact S&P preferences and needs, existing S&P systems are often designed with little understanding of these behaviors. This mismatch forces users to choose between implementing their ideal S&P policies or reducing social friction. To address this, we outline a research agenda for social cybersecurity that better aligns S&P goals with social needs, preferences, and behaviors.

## I. Introduction
Many end-user cybersecurity and privacy (S&P) behaviors are inherently social. We share information with our social networks, seek advice from friends and family on S&P practices, and coordinate with others to stay safe online. Usable S&P research has acknowledged the influence of social factors on S&P behaviors since the late 1990s. However, most tools aimed at improving S&P have been designed primarily for individual use, focusing on usability improvements in authentication systems, access control policy interfaces, and S&P warnings.

The increasing interconnectedness of people on the Internet has led to growing interest in studying S&P beyond individual actors. Emerging perspectives, such as social cybersecurity, socio-technical cybersecurity, community oversight, and networked privacy, aim to understand S&P behaviors and threats in an ecosystem of interconnectedness and influence. These approaches vary in the scales of populations they consider and how they frame the experience of individuals within these populations, from high-level considerations of threat propagation through large social networks to personalized investigations of S&P in families and households.

In this paper, we synthesize insights from the broad literature on social cybersecurity, highlighting gaps and proposing areas for future exploration. We identify four key behavior domains: negotiating access to shared resources, shared and social authentication, managing self-presentation, and influencing others’ S&P behaviors. Within these domains, we categorize specific behaviors into four distinct scales of social organization: intimate, personal, social, and public.

Empirical studies in the literature show how human social dynamics complicate the use of technical tools intended to support S&P practices. Users must adapt their social practices to fit the affordances of these tools or reappropriate existing technology in new ways, sometimes reducing S&P against the threats those technologies are designed to thwart. This tension between the needs of social groups and the support provided by technology is known as the social-technical gap, as described by Ackerman.

Many challenges in social cybersecurity arise due to this gap, where S&P burdens are placed on users who must navigate social situations with tools designed without considering social behavior. The literature also includes attempts to create new technical tools that support or leverage existing social practices. Accordingly, we suggest directions for future social cybersecurity work.

## II. Methodology and Scoping
Our fundamental contribution is a taxonomy and synthesis of existing work on social cybersecurity. Our methodology involved three phases: gathering relevant prior work, identifying common themes, and grouping themes into taxonomically significant domains.

We began by searching the ACM Digital Library using index terms like "human and societal aspects of security and privacy" and "social aspects of security and privacy." We supplemented these with known keywords such as "social cybersecurity," "collaboration," "community," "privacy," and "security." As we identified disparate social scales and contexts, we expanded our searches with new keywords like "couples," "intimate partner violence," "family," "households," "teenagers," "social networks," and "workplace."

We initially scoped our collection to include prior work from the last five years of conferences such as CCS, CHI, CSCW, IEEE S&P, NDSS, PETS, SOUPS, TheWebConf, and USENIX Security. Older, highly cited works from other venues, such as NSPW and UbiComp, were also included. These searches resulted in about 1000 articles, which we narrowed down to approximately 100 by including only works that involved some element of social coordination or cooperation with end-user S&P behaviors.

From each paper, we extracted the core research questions, methodology, analysis, results, research context, targeted stakeholders, and authors' recommendations for future work. This data was organized into a spreadsheet. We then applied a reflexive approach to thematic analysis, with one researcher performing the initial coding and updating the codebook as new codes and categories emerged. Two additional researchers participated in iterative discussions to organize codes and generate four taxonomically significant domains, which form the basis of our structured and systematized review of social cybersecurity.

## III. Systematization
In our coding process, we found that prior work in social cybersecurity tended to focus on specific user S&P behaviors that were either enabled or complicated by social interaction. We identified four broad behavior domains commonly investigated across the literature:

1. **Negotiating Access to Shared Resources**: This includes sharing media accounts, devices, work files, physical access to workspaces, carpools, cars, and homes. These use cases require trust between sharers, which in turn requires negotiation of mutual S&P practices. This section also covers password-sharing behaviors, which can function as coarse-grained access control for small groups.

2. **Shared and Social Authentication**: This domain includes user reliance on others to help them authenticate and systems that facilitate group authentication.
