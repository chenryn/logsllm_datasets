### Implement and document self-service password reset and combined security information registration
- **What**: Enable and configure self-service password reset (SSPR) in your organization and enable the combined security information registration experience.
- **Why**: Users are able to reset their own passwords once they have registered. The combined security information registration experience provides a better user experience allowing registration for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and self-service password reset. These tools when used together contribute to lower helpdesk costs and more satisfied users.

- **Measure key results**: Self-service password reset is fully configured and available to the organization
### Protect admin accounts - Enable and require MFA / Passwordless for Microsoft Entra ID privileged users
- **What**: Require all privileged accounts in Microsoft Entra ID to use strong multifactor authentication
- **Why**: To protect access to data and services in Microsoft 365.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
   - **Sponsorship:** This initiative is typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity
   - **Execution:** This initiative is a collaborative effort involving
     - [Policy and standards](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-policy-standards) team document clear requirements and standards (based on this guidance)
     - [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) or [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) to implement any changes
     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
     - [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) Helpdesk processes have been updated and personnel has been trained on them
     - [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) Service owner processes have been updated and personnel has been trained on them
- **How**: Turn on Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) and register all other highly privileged single-user non-federated admin accounts. Require multifactor authentication at sign-in for all individual users who are permanently assigned to one or more of the Microsoft Entra admin roles like:
   - Global administrator
   - Privileged Role administrator
   - Exchange administrator
   - SharePoint administrator
   Require administrators to use passwordless sign-in methods such as FIDO2 security keys or Windows Hello for Business in conjunction with unique, long, complex passwords. Enforce this change with an organizational policy document.
Follow the guidance in the following articles, [Plan a Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication deployment](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted) and 
[Plan a passwordless authentication deployment in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment).
- **Measure key results**: 100% of privileged users are using passwordless authentication or a strong form of multifactor authentication for all logons. See [Privileged Access Accounts](privileged-access-accounts.md) for description of multifactor authentication
### Block legacy authentication protocols for privileged user accounts
- **What**: Block legacy authentication protocol use for privileged user accounts.
- **Why**: Organizations should block these legacy authentication protocols because multifactor authentication cannot be enforced against them. Leaving legacy authentication protocols enabled can create an entry point for attackers. Some legacy applications may rely on these protocols and organizations have the option to create specific exceptions for certain accounts. These exceptions should be tracked and additional monitoring controls implemented.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).

     - [Security Compliance management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-compliance-management) monitors to ensure compliance
- **How**: To block legacy authentication protocols in your organization, follow the guidance in the article [How to: Block legacy authentication to Microsoft Entra ID with Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication).
- **Measure key results**: 
   - **Legacy protocols blocked:** All legacy protocols are blocked for all users, with only authorized exceptions
   - **Exceptions** are reviewed every 90 days and expire permanently within one year. Application owners must fix all exceptions within one year of first exception approval 
### Application consent process
- **What**: Disable end-user consent to Microsoft Entra applications. 
> [!NOTE]
> This change will require centralizing the decision-making process with your organization's security and identity administration teams.
- **Why**: Users can inadvertently create organizational risk by providing consent for an app that can maliciously access organizational data. 
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).

- **How**: Establish a centralized consent process to maintain centralized visibility and control of the applications that have access to data by following the guidance in the article, [Managing consent to applications and evaluating consent requests](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests).
- **Measure key results**: End users are not able to consent to Microsoft Entra application access
### Clean up account and sign-in risks
- **What**: Enable Microsoft Entra ID Protection and cleanup any risks that it finds.
- **Why**: Risky user and sign-in behavior can be a source of attacks against your organization.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).

- **Measure key results**: The organization has zero unaddressed user and sign-in risks. 
> [!NOTE]
> Conditional Access policies are required to block accrual of new sign-in risks. See the Conditional access section of [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md#azure-active-directory-configuration)
## Admin workstations initial deployment
- **What**: Privileged accounts such as Global Administrators  have dedicated workstations to perform administrative tasks from.
- **Why**: Devices where privileged administration tasks are completed are a target of attackers. Securing not only the account but these assets are critical in reducing your attack surface area. This separation limits their exposure to common attacks directed at productivity-related tasks like email and web browsing.
- **Who**: This initiative is typically led by [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).

     - [Central IT Operations](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/central-it) Service owner processes have been updated and personnel has been trained on them
- **How**: Initial deployment should be to the Enterprise level as described in the article [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md)
- **Measure key results**: Every privileged account has a dedicated workstation to perform sensitive tasks from.
> [!NOTE]
> This step rapidly establishes a security baseline and must be increased to specialized and privileged levels as soon as possible.
