## Execution
This initiative is a collaborative effort involving the following teams:
- **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards based on the provided guidance.
- **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any necessary changes.
- **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.

### How
Deploy and enable [Microsoft Defender for Identity](/defender-for-identity/what-is#whats-next) and review any open alerts.

### Measure Key Results
All open alerts are reviewed and mitigated by the appropriate teams.

## Improve Credential Management Experience
### Implement and Document Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) and Combined Security Information Registration

#### What
Enable and configure SSPR in your organization and enable the combined security information registration experience.

#### Why
Users can reset their own passwords once they have registered. The combined security information registration experience provides a better user experience, allowing registration for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and SSPR. These tools, when used together, contribute to lower helpdesk costs and more satisfied users.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any changes.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.
  - **Central IT Operations**: Update helpdesk processes and train personnel.

#### How
To enable and deploy SSPR, see the article [Plan a Microsoft Entra self-service password reset deployment](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-sspr-deployment).

#### Measure Key Results
Self-service password reset is fully configured and available to the organization.

### Protect Admin Accounts - Enable and Require MFA/Passwordless for Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Users

#### What
Require all privileged accounts in Microsoft Entra ID to use strong multifactor authentication.

#### Why
To protect access to data and services in Microsoft 365.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any changes.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.
  - **Central IT Operations**: Update helpdesk and service owner processes and train personnel.

#### How
Turn on Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication (MFA) and register all other highly privileged single-user non-federated admin accounts. Require MFA at sign-in for all individual users who are permanently assigned to one or more of the following roles:
- Global Administrator
- Privileged Role Administrator
- Exchange Administrator
- SharePoint Administrator

Require administrators to use passwordless sign-in methods such as FIDO2 security keys or Windows Hello for Business, along with unique, long, complex passwords. Enforce this change with an organizational policy document.

Follow the guidance in the following articles:
- [Plan a Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication deployment](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted)
- [Plan a passwordless authentication deployment in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-deployment)

#### Measure Key Results
100% of privileged users are using passwordless authentication or a strong form of multifactor authentication for all logons. See [Privileged Access Accounts](privileged-access-accounts.md) for a description of multifactor authentication.

### Block Legacy Authentication Protocols for Privileged User Accounts

#### What
Block legacy authentication protocol use for privileged user accounts.

#### Why
Organizations should block these legacy authentication protocols because MFA cannot be enforced against them. Leaving legacy authentication protocols enabled can create an entry point for attackers. Some legacy applications may rely on these protocols, and organizations have the option to create specific exceptions for certain accounts. These exceptions should be tracked, and additional monitoring controls implemented.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Establish clear requirements.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement the policy.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.

#### How
To block legacy authentication protocols in your organization, follow the guidance in the article [How to: Block legacy authentication to Microsoft Entra ID with Conditional Access](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication).

#### Measure Key Results
- **Legacy protocols blocked**: All legacy protocols are blocked for all users, with only authorized exceptions.
- **Exceptions**: Reviewed every 90 days and expire permanently within one year. Application owners must fix all exceptions within one year of first exception approval.

### Application Consent Process

#### What
Disable end-user consent to Microsoft Entra applications.

> **Note**
> This change will require centralizing the decision-making process with your organization's security and identity administration teams.

#### Why
Users can inadvertently create organizational risk by providing consent for an app that can maliciously access organizational data.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any changes.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.
  - **Central IT Operations**: Update helpdesk and service owner processes and train personnel.

#### How
Establish a centralized consent process to maintain centralized visibility and control of the applications that have access to data by following the guidance in the article [Managing consent to applications and evaluating consent requests](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/manage-consent-requests).

#### Measure Key Results
End users are not able to consent to Microsoft Entra application access.

### Clean Up Account and Sign-In Risks

#### What
Enable Microsoft Entra ID Protection and clean up any risks it finds.

#### Why
Risky user and sign-in behavior can be a source of attacks against your organization.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any changes.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.
  - **Central IT Operations**: Update helpdesk processes and train personnel.

#### How
Create a process that monitors and manages user and sign-in risk. Decide if you will automate remediation using Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication and SSPR, or block and require administrator intervention. Follow the guidance in the article [How To: Configure and enable risk policies](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies).

#### Measure Key Results
The organization has zero unaddressed user and sign-in risks.

> **Note**
> Conditional Access policies are required to block the accrual of new sign-in risks. See the Conditional Access section of [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md#azure-active-directory-configuration).

## Admin Workstations Initial Deployment

#### What
Privileged accounts, such as Global Administrators, have dedicated workstations to perform administrative tasks from.

#### Why
Devices where privileged administration tasks are completed are a target of attackers. Securing not only the account but also these assets is critical in reducing your attack surface area. This separation limits their exposure to common attacks directed at productivity-related tasks like email and web browsing.

#### Who
- **Leadership**: [Identity and Key Management](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-identity-keys) and/or [Security Architecture](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/cloud-security-architecture).
- **Sponsorship**: Typically sponsored by CISO, CIO, or Director of Identity.
- **Execution**:
  - **Policy and Standards Team**: Document clear requirements and standards.
  - **Identity and Key Management or Central IT Operations**: Implement any changes.
  - **Security Compliance Management**: Monitor to ensure compliance.
  - **Central IT Operations**: Update helpdesk and service owner processes and train personnel.

#### How
Initial deployment should be to the Enterprise level as described in the article [Privileged Access Deployment](privileged-access-deployment.md).

#### Measure Key Results
Every privileged account has a dedicated workstation to perform sensitive tasks from.

> **Note**
> This step rapidly establishes a security baseline and must be increased to specialized and privileged levels as soon as possible.
