User: I've been experimenting with the Google App Engine, and I'm trying to import certain libraries in order to execute API commands. I've been having trouble importing, however. When I tried to  execute "from apiclient.discovery import build", my website doesn't load anymore. When I test locally in IDLE, this command works.
Assistant: The packages needs to be locally available, where did you put the packages, in the Python folder or in your project folder?
