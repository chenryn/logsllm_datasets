## Checklist
  * I have included the output of `celery -A proj report` in the issue.  
(if you are not able to do this, then at least specify the Celery  
version affected).
  * I have verified that the issue exists against the `master` branch of Celery.
Running from commit `21baef5`. Report cannot be run since nothing is able to
start.
## Steps to reproduce
Create a minimal worker, but use a backend URI that specifies a failover set
as specified by the documentation
Hostnames do not matter since no connection attempt will be made
    from celery import Celery
    c = Celery(
        __name__,
        broker="sentinel://host1:8080;sentinel://host2:8080;sentinel://host3:8080",
        backend="sentinel://host1:8080;sentinel://host2:8080;sentinel://host3:8080"
    )
    @c.task
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y
Run as normal with `celery -A minimal_celery worker`
## Expected behavior
Worker loads and starts as normal
## Actual behavior
Celery banner formatter attempts to parse the string as a single URI and
cannot extract the port number
