User: Python is on my machine, I just don't know where, if I type python in terminal it will open Python 2.6.4, this isn't in it's default directory, there surely is a way of finding it's install location from here?
Assistant: For Windows CMD run: where python
For Windows PowerShell run: Get-Command python
