### Feature request
##transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained()## module allows to load pretrained
models from local directories as well. The local pickle files path is an
argument of the above function. These files can have different encoding types.
A parameter called 'encoding' can be added in the parameter list similar to
pandas.read_csv('path/to/csv/file',encoding='utf-8')
which takes encoding type as parameter. But this proposed encoding feature
must be enabled only while loading local files and should not take parameters
while loading models from other sources (like HF-Hub etc).
### Motivation
I face Unicode-Decode error while loading pickled model files from local
directory. To overcome this issue, the above feature would help to avoid the
unicode-decode error.
