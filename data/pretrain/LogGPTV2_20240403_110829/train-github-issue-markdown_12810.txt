### Feature Request

The `transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained()` function allows loading pre-trained models from local directories. The local files, which can have different encoding types, are specified as an argument to this function. To handle these varying encodings, a new parameter called `encoding` should be added to the function, similar to how `pandas.read_csv('path/to/csv/file', encoding='utf-8')` accepts an encoding type. This `encoding` parameter should only be enabled when loading models from local files and not when loading from other sources, such as the Hugging Face Model Hub.

### Motivation

I frequently encounter UnicodeDecodeErrors when loading pickled model files from a local directory. Adding the proposed `encoding` parameter would help mitigate this issue by allowing the user to specify the correct encoding, thereby avoiding such errors.

### Your Contribution

Unfortunately, I am unable to contribute to the implementation of this feature at this time.
