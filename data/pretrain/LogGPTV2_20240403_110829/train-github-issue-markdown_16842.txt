Dear dev,
I like combining box and strip plots, I also like making optimal use of
seaborn categorical plotting features, i.e. like this:
    sns.catplot(kind='point', data=alldata_long, x='gene_id', y='TPM', hue='Exp condition', row='Lib prep', height=3, aspect=4)
I would like to be able to combine both approaches, would the command from the
title of this post be an option? At the moment I am having difficulties
combining the two plots in a row and col split catplot...
Highest regards,
Freek.
