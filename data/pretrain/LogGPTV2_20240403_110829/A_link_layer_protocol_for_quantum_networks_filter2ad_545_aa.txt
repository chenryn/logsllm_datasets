ABSTRACT
Quantum communication brings radically new capabilities
that are provably impossible to attain in any classical net-
work. Here, we take the first step from a physics experiment
to a fully fledged quantum internet system. We propose a
functional allocation of a quantum network stack and con-
struct the first physical and link layer protocols that turn
ad-hoc physics experiments producing heralded entangle-
ment between quantum processors into a well-defined and
robust service. This lays the groundwork for designing and
implementing scalable control and application protocols in
platform-independent software. To design our protocol, we
identify use cases, as well as fundamental and technological
design considerations of quantum network hardware, illus-
trated by considering the state-of-the-art quantum processor
platform available to us (Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond). Using a purpose built discrete-event simulator
for quantum networks, we examine the robustness and per-
formance of our protocol using extensive simulations on a
supercomputing cluster. We perform a full implementation
of our protocol, where we successfully validate the physical
simulation model against data gathered from the NV hard-
ware. We first observe that our protocol is robust even in a
regime of exaggerated losses of classical control messages
with only little impact on the performance of the system.We
proceed to study the performance of our protocols for 169
distinct simulation scenarios, including tradeoffs between
traditional performance metrics such as throughput and the
quality of entanglement. Finally, we initiate the study of
quantum network scheduling strategies to optimize protocol
performance for different use cases.
1 INTRODUCTION
Quantum communication enables the transmission of quan-
tum bits (qubits) in order to achieve novel capabilities that
are provably impossible using classical communication. As
with any radically new technology, it is hard to predict all
uses of a future Quantum Internet [62, 101], but several major
applications have already been identified depending on
Figure 1: Entanglement enables long-distance quan-
tum communication: (a) once two qubits (purple/dark)
are confirmed to be entangled (threaded links between
qubits), a data qubit (yellow/light) can be sent deter-
ministically using teleportation [11], consuming the
entangled pair; (b) long-distance entanglement can be
built from shorter segments: If node A is entangled
with B (repeater), and B with C, then B can perform
entanglement swapping [107] to create long-distance
entanglement between the qubits at A and C.
the stage of quantum network development [101], ranging
from cryptography [10, 40], sensing and metrology [46, 63],
distributed systems [9, 36], to secure quantum cloud com-
puting [20, 43].
Qubits are fundamentally different from classical bits,
which brings significant challenges both to the physical im-
plementation of quantum networks, as well as the design
of quantum network architectures. Qubits cannot be copied,
ruling out signal amplification or repetition to overcome
transmission losses to bridge great distances. Two qubits can
share a special relation known as entanglement, even if these
two qubits are stored at distant network nodes. Such en-
tanglement is central not only to enable novel applications,
but also provides a means to realize a quantum repeater,
which enables quantum communication over long-distances
(Figure 1).
At present, short-lived entanglement has been produced
probabilistically over short distances (≈ 100 km) on the
ground by sending photons over standard telecom fiber (see
e.g. [39, 55]), as well as from space over 1203km from a satel-
lite [103]. Such systems can allow the realization of appli-
cations in the prepare-and-measure stage [101] of quantum

be concatenated to allow the transmission of qubits over
longer distances.
In order to enable long-distance quantum communica-
tion and the execution of complex quantum applications, we
would like to produce long-lived entanglement between two
quantum nodes that are capable of storing and manipulating
qubits. To do so efficiently (Section 3.1), we need to confirm
entanglement generation by performing heralded entangle-
ment generation. This means that there is a heralding signal
that tells us if we have been successful in an attempt to
generate entanglement.
The current world distance record for producing such
entanglement is 1.3km, which has been achieved using a
solid state platform known as Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) cen-
tres in diamond [49]. Intuitively, this platform is a few qubit
(as of now maximum 8 [21]) quantum computer capable of
arbitrary quantum gates, with an optical interface for ini-
tialization, measurement and entanglement generation. Key
capabilities of the NV platform have already been demon-
strated, including qubit lifetimes of 1.46 s [3], entanglement
production faster than it is lost [53], and using entanglement
to teleport qubits between separated NV centres [78]. Other
hardware platforms exist that are identical on an abstract
level (quantum computer with an optical interface), and on
which heralded long-lived entanglement generation has been
demonstrated (e.g. Ion Traps [70], and Neutral Atoms [50]).
Theoretical proposals and early stage demonstrations of in-
dividual components also exists for other physical platforms
(e.g. quantum dots [35], rare earth ion-doped crystals [97],
atomic gases [26, 57], and superconducting qubits [74]), but
their performance is not yet good enough to generate entan-
glement faster than it is lost.
Up to now, the generation of long-lived entanglement
has been the domain of highly sophisticated, but arguably
ad-hoc physics experiments. We are now on the verge of
seeing early stage quantum networks becoming a reality,
entering a new phase of development which will require a
joint effort across physics, computer science and engineering
to overcome the many challenges in scaling such networks.
In this paper, we take the first step from a physics experiment
to a fully-fledged quantum communication system.
Design considerations and use cases: We identify gen-
eral design considerations for quantum networks based on
fundamental properties of entanglement, and technologi-
cal limitations of near-term quantum hardware, illustrated
with the example of our NV platform. For the first time, we
identify systematic use cases, and employ them to guide the
design of our stack and protocols.
Functional allocation quantum network stack: We
propose a functional allocation of a quantum network stack,
and define the service desired from its link layer to satisfy

networking where shared state is established at higher
layers.
use case requirements and design considerations. In analogy
to classical networking, the link layer is responsible for pro-
ducing entanglement between two nodes that share a direct
physical connection (e.g. optical fiber).
First physical and link layer entanglement genera-
tion protocols: We proceed to construct the world’s first
physical and link layer protocols that turn ad-hoc physics
experiments producing heralded entanglement into a well
defined service. This lays the groundwork for designing and
implementing control and application protocols in platform
independent software in order to build and scale quantum
networks. At the physical layer, we focus primarily on the
quantum hardware available to us (NV platform) but the
same protocol could be realized directly using Ion Traps
or Neutral Atoms, as well as —with small changes— other
means of producing physical entanglement [89]. Our link
layer protocol takes into account the intricacies of the NV
platform, but is in itself already platform independent.
Simulation validated against quantum hardware: Us-
ing a purpose built discrete-event simulator for quantum
networks, we examine the robustness and performance of
our protocol using more than 169 scenarios totaling 94244h
wall time and 707h simulated time on a supercomputing clus-
ter. To this end, we perform a complete implementation of
our protocols and let them use simulated quantum hardware
and communication links. To illustrate their performance,
we consider two concrete short and long-distance scenarios
based on the NV platform: (1) Lab where the nodes A and
B are 2m apart. Since this setup has already been realized,
we can use it to compare the performance of the entangle-
ment generation implemented on real quantum hardware
against the simulation to validate its physical model, and
(2) a planned implementation of QL2020 where A and B are
in two European cities separated by ≈ 25 km over telecom
fiber. Next, to investigate trade-offs between traditional per-
formance metrics (e.g. throughput or latency) and genuinely

quantum ones (fidelity, Section 4.2), we take a first step in
examining different quantum network scheduling strategies
to optimize performance for different use cases.
2 RELATED WORK
At present there is no quantum network stack connected to
quantum hardware, no link layer protocols have been defined
to produce entanglement, and no quantum networks capable
of end-to-end qubit transmission or entanglement produc-
tion have been realized (see [101] and references therein).
A functional allocation of a stack for quantum repeaters
and protocols controlling entanglement distillation (a pro-
cedure to increase the quality of entanglement) has been
outlined in [6, 68, 69, 100], which is complementary to this
work. This is very useful to ultimately realize entanglement
distillation, even though no concrete control protocols or
connection to a hardware system were yet given. We remark
that here we do not draw layers from specific protocols like
entanglement distillation, but focus on the service that these
layers should provide (a layer protocol may of course choose
distillation as a mean to realize requirements). An outline of
a quantum network stack was also put forward in [80], in-
cluding an appealing high level quantum information theory
protocol transforming multi-partite entanglement. However,
this high level protocol does not yet consider failure modes,
hardware imperfections, nor the requirements on entangle-
ment generation protocols and the impact of classical control.
Plans to realize the physical layer of a quantum network from
a systems view were put forward in [65], however develop-
ment has taken a different route.
In the domain of single-use point-to-point links for quan-
tum key distribution (QKD), software has been developed for
trusted repeater networks [101] to make use of such key in
e.g. VoIP [64]. However, these do not allow end-to-end trans-
mission of qubits or generation of entanglement, and rely on
trust in the intermediary nodes who can eavesdrop on the
communication. Control using software defined networks
(SDN) to assist trusted repeater nodes has been proposed,
e.g. [81, 104]. These QKD-centric protocols however do not
address control problems in true quantum networks aimed
at end-to-end delivery of qubits, and the generation of long-
lived entanglement.
In contrast, classical networking knows a vast literature
on designing and analyzing network protocols. Some ideas
can indeed be borrowed from classical networking such as
scheduling methods, but fundamental properties of quantum
entanglement (Section A.2), as well as technological consider-
ations of quantum hardware capabilities (Section 4.5) call for
new protocols and methods of network control and manage-
ment. Naturally, there is a continuous flow of systems papers
proposing new networking architectures, e.g. for SDN [17],
data center networks [48], content delivery networks [24] or
cloud computing [106], to name a few. Yet, we are unaware of
any system-level papers proposing a quantum network stack
including protocols for concrete hardware implementations.
3 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS FOR
QUANTUM NETWORK
ARCHITECTURES
We first discuss design considerations of quantum networks
themselves, followed by considerations specific to the phys-
ical and link layer (Section 4). These can be roughly subdi-
vided into three categories: (i) fundamental considerations
due to quantum entanglement, (ii) technological limitations
of near-term quantum hardware, and (iii) requirements of
quantum protocols themselves.
3.1 Qubits and Entanglement
We focus on properties of entanglement as relevant for us-
age and control (see Appendix and [76]). Teleportation [11]
allows entanglement to be used to send qubits (see Figure 1).
We will hence also call two entangled qubits an entangled
link or entangled pair. Teleportation consumes the entangled
link, and requires two additional classical bits to be trans-
mitted per qubit teleported. Already at the level of qubit
transmission we hence observe the need for a close inte-
gration between a quantum and classical communications.
Specifically, we will need to match quantum data stored in
quantum devices, with classical control information that is
sent over a separate physical medium, akin to optical control
plane architectures for classical optical networks [92]. To
create long-distance entanglement, we can first attempt to
