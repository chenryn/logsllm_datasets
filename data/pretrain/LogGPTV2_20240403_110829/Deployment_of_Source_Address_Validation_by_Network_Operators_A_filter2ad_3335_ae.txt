the effects of AS- and country-level characteristics on SAV
implementation rate, and to determine the extent to which
characteristics at the AS and country levels explain variations
in SAV implementation rates. The multi-level Cox proportional
hazards model allowed us to account for the hierarchical
structure of the data. We hypothesize that ASes are nested
within countries with different socio-economic characteristics.
This suggests that ASes with similar characteristics can have
different SAV implementation rates when operating in coun-
tries with different characteristics.
Using the multi-level Cox proportional hazards model, the
probability of implementing SAV after receiving the notiﬁca-
tion was regarded as the hazard. We assessed the assumption
of proportional hazard using visual inspections of graphs and
statistical tests based on weighted Schoenfeld residuals. Two-
sided p-values (≤ 0.05) indicated statistical signiﬁcance. As
explanatory variables we used socio-technical factors and a
set of factors derived from the operators’ email responses,
including the following:
CERT: boolean variable. True if the notiﬁcation was sent
to the national CERT, False otherwise.
NOG: boolean variable. True if the notiﬁcation was sent
to the NOG, False otherwise.
Private: boolean variable. True if the notiﬁcation was sent
to the technical contact email address of the AS, False
otherwise.
AS size: numerical variable. We estimated the size of an
AS by counting the number of advertised IPv4 addresses.
We calculated the size using BGP data from Routeviews
project [63]. We used weekly data for Oct 2020 and calculated
the average IP space advertised by the ASes in our data set.
ISP: boolean variable. True if the AS belonged to an
Internet Service Provider, False otherwise. To check whether
an AS is used by an ISP we leveraged Telegeography: the
GlobalComms database [64]. The database contains a highly
reliable overview of the main broadband ISPs in each country,
drawn from annual reports and market ﬁlings. The database
contains details of major ISPs in 84 countries.
Edge Rtr: numerical variable. This variable is calculated
by counting the number of edge routers of an AS. We
used CAIDA’s Internet Topology Data Kit (ITDK) for March
2021 [65] to count the number of border routers per AS.
The ITDK consists of routers and links observed in traceroute
data collected from multiple vantage points, alias resolution
to identify which IP addresses belong to the same router [66],
and a mapping from router to AS heuristically inferred using
bdrmapIT [67]. We counted the number of border routers for
ASes in our dataset connected to other ASes.
Stub: boolean variable. True if the AS is stub, False
otherwise. We used Caida’s AS relationship data [68] to
determine if the ASes in our data set are stub or not.
IDI: numerical variable. This variable represents the ICT
Development Index (IDI) which is provided by ITU (United
Nations International Telecommunication Union) and repre-
sents ICT development per country [69]. It assigns values from
1 to 10 to each country, with a higher value representing a
higher level of development based on various ICT indicators.
In Table II, we present the results from the Cox model. The
parameter estimates reported in the est column are log-hazard
ratios. Their exponentiation produces hazard ratios. P-values
indicate the statistical signiﬁcance of each factor.

The notiﬁcation channels did not impact signiﬁcantly the
implementation of SAV. Interestingly, only the NOG group has
a positive coefﬁcient which indicates that ASes that received
a notiﬁcation via this channel have higher probability of
remediating than those in the control group. In particular, the
hazard ratio for the NOG group is exp(0.23) = 1.25. Therefore,
notifying operators via NOG increases the probability of
remediation by 1.25 times compared to ASes that received
no notiﬁcation.
Regarding the impact of AS size on SAV deployment, the
argument can be made on both sides. For instance, bigger
networks are more likely to have more resources to implement
SAV. On the other hand, smaller networks are likely to have
less complex networks and hence require relatively simpler
conﬁgurations to implement SAV. In our results, we observe
that smaller ASes were more likely to implement SAV in their
networks. In particular, a 10% increase in the size of an AS,
holding all other variables constant, was associated with a
5.82% decrease in the probability of SAV deployment.
The number of edge routers also decreases the probability
of remediation. Network operators use multiple links to load-
balance the trafﬁc and avoid a single point of failure. To
remediate, operators have to implement ﬁltering policies near
all edge routers. We found that networks with fewer edge
routers were more likely to remediate after being notiﬁed. In

particular, a 10% increase in the number of edge routers in an
AS, holding all other variables constant, was associated with
a 4.87% decrease in the probability of SAV deployment.
There could be technical reasons preventing network op-
erators from implementing SAV in their network. One factor
could be having a non-stub or a transit AS. A customer of non-
stub AS might not announce all routes to a provider because
the AS is a customer of other providers as well. Hence, it is not
technically feasible for provider ASes to apply strict ﬁltering
policies on their network [6]. We ﬁnd that stub networks
have 1.4 times higher remediation rate than the control group
(holding all other variables constant). The country-level effect,
an estimated intercept (excess risk) for each country, has a
standard deviation of 0.21. This means that countries that are
1 standard deviation or more above the mean SAV remediation
rate will have 1.24 times faster remediation rate than the norm,
a modestly small country-level effect.
The other factors we considered did not signiﬁcantly impact
the remediation. One could hypothesize that ISPs would be
more likely to implement SAV in their network since most
end users are behind their networks and can be abused for an
attack. While the hazard ratio sign indicates such relationship,
we did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant difference in remedia-
tion rate for networks that are ISPs compared to the control
group. Finally, socio-economic factors deﬁned by the ICT
Development Index (IDI) did not inﬂuence the remediation,
suggesting that the economic situation of a country has no
impact on the remediation hazard.
In summary, we can conclude that network complexity plays
an important role in remediation, i.e., the networks that are
smaller in size and have fewer edge routers are likely to
remediate faster. Similarly, stub networks are more likely to
implement SAV faster in their network compared to non-stub.
VI. SURVEY RESULTS
To gain additional
insights and feedback from the par-
ticipants, we sent out the survey one month after our ﬁnal
notiﬁcation. We sent a reminder to participate in the survey
to non-responders after waiting for a month. We received
responses from 32 network operators (less than 2%). While
sample size does not allow us to make statistical comparisons
between treatment groups, we believe that survey responses
provide useful clariﬁcations for interpreting our results.
a) Vulnerability Awareness: Ninety percent of survey
respondents knew they had not deployed SAV, either because
of the Spoofer tool test (30%), notiﬁcations from security
researchers (20%), from NOGs (20%), from CERTs(10%), or
based on their prior knowledge (10%). The remaining 10%
were not sure if their networks deployed SAV.
b) SAV Implementation: Although 90% of respondents
were aware that their network lacked SAV, more than half
(52.7%) of the respondents reported that they have no ﬁltering
in place. Another 17% reported only partial implementation on
some segments of the networks. Only 26% have implemented
SAV throughout their network, and 4% were not sure.
More than half of respondents (53%) ﬁltered out pack-
ets with a source IP address within private address space
(RFC1918), so that only packets with a source address from
routable IP space leave their network. It is important to note
that ﬁltering RFC1918 is simple as it has static address space
and the ﬁltering mechanisms are widely available. Lichtblau
et al. [17] reported 70% of participants in their survey ﬁltered
RFC1918 addresses.
Moreover, 30% of respondents deployed SAV on routers
that were customer-facing, 11% on their stub ASes, and 6%
deployed SAV towards peering/IXP interfaces as well. In other
words, they have deployed SAV in user space and those IPs
cannot be abused to send spoofed trafﬁc.
When we asked participants if they planned to deploy SAV
in the future, we received mixed responses. Around 42% said
that they were planning to deploy SAV, 33% had no plan,
and 25% were not sure. One provider also sent us an email
in response to our notiﬁcation, saying that he acknowledges
the issue and will get back to it after implementing another
security practice (RPKI) in his network. Given that non-
compliance is not an active “battleground,” it is likely that
some providers assign SAV deployment to a lower priority
compared to other network issues, but they might return to
it later. However, we still think that 4 months we gave to
the participants provided sufﬁcient time to plan and remediate
the issue, yet, we did not observe a signiﬁcant impact on the
outcome.
c) Notiﬁcation Targets: It is possible that despite aware-
ness, the respondents did not implement SAV, simply because
they are not responsible for it. We wanted to conﬁrm whether
we reached the operator staff responsible for implementing
SAV. There could be multiple reasons for not reaching the
operator staff responsible for implementing SAV. For instance,
83% of the contacts we notiﬁed only had the address of the
abuse mailbox. The abuse team is generally responsible for
threats like spam, malware, and phishing campaigns from
or towards the network. In cases where operators are not
responsible, they may have another team performing network
conﬁgurations.
However, a large majority (67%) of respondents said that
they were responsible for implementing SAV. Only 13% said
that they were not responsible, and 20% did not know what
SAV is. Subsequently, respondents that believed they were not
responsible for SAV said they did not escalate the issue to the
responsible contact.
d) Reasons for Non-Compliance: We also asked oper-
ators why they had not implemented SAV in their networks.
30% of the respondents lacked the technical knowledge on
how to perform ﬁltering, and 30% lacked time to implement
SAV. Another 18% were concerned that implementation may
cause downtime or other performance issues. 12% mentioned
technical reasons (multi-homed network, non-stub network)
for not implementing SAV. Finally, 6% of the respondents
thought that SAV is ineffective in addressing the attacks that
use spoofed source addresses.

We can conclude from the survey results that the main rea-
sons for non-compliance are driven by misaligned incentives
and lack of knowledge, which are relatively easy to improve,
compared to the concerns related to downtime, performance,
or technical limitations.
e) Respondents’ Suggestions for Improvements:
In
the ﬁnal section of the survey, we asked participants for
suggestions about possible improvements in the notiﬁcation
process. We sent MANRS guidelines [70] as part of our
notiﬁcation. About 73% of the respondents said that MANRS
had sufﬁcient information explaining how to implement SAV.
However, 23% were not sure, and 4% said that MANRS does
not provide sufﬁcient details. They explained that the guide
currently provides conﬁgurations only for CISCO and Juniper
routers, and needs to cover conﬁgurations for other brands of
routers as well. For example, one of our respondents said they
used a Mikrotik router, which is not covered in MANRS.
One respondent suggested to create a dedicated channel for
SAV notiﬁcations, where operators can also discuss technical
difﬁculties in implementing SAV. 64% of the respondents
requested more community-driven seminars that discuss SAV
implementation. Finally, 36% of respondents suggested that
routers should provide user friendly conﬁgurations to imple-
ment SAV.
While the sample size of our survey does not allow us
to extensively generalize the results, it still provides valu-
able insights. We provide recommendations for improving
the notiﬁcation process and policies for SAV compliance in
section VII.
VII. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSIONS
In this section, we interpret our results, discuss issues that
might have played a role in low remediation, and present future
avenues for improving both notiﬁcations and SAV adoption.
A. Treatment Effects
Except for the Brazilian NOG group, there are no signiﬁcant
differences when comparing remediation between the treat-
ments and the control group. There can be multiple reasons
why the Brazilian NOG group had higher remediation rates
than the control group. First, operators that have subscribed
to a NOG show their willingness to understand and discuss
network challenges. Second, it creates peer pressure because
the names of ASes are publicly available, while they can
ignore the private communication. Finally, operators might
trust the NOG channel, since the communication was part of
the already known Spoofer project [7].
B. Remediation in the Control Group
We also observed remediation in the control group, where
we did not send any notiﬁcations. There could be several
reasons for that. First, some network operators might have
upgraded their routers or policies, which we count as a natural
remediation.
Second, some operators might have read articles or attended
conference talks or seminars about current routing issues,
which could have urged the operators to adopt SAV. For in-
stance, in the RIPE meeting in Oct 2020, with more than 1200
participants, MANRS presented their initiatives about routing
security, including available resources to deploy SAV [71].
SAV is also discussed in various network operator conferences
and channels, which might have further encouraged the adop-
tion [72]–[74].
Finally, the MANRS program, which encourages members
to be SAV compliant, has been very active in the recent years.
They provide resources in the form of documentation, tutorials,
and seminars to help network operators deploy best security
practices. They reported that their members doubled in 2020,
reaching 588 by the end of December 2020 [75].
While there can be many factors driving natural remedia-
tion, they affect all treatment and control groups equally. So
we can still have conﬁdence in our conclusions about the null
effect of the treatments. This is the essence of the random
assignment process: it neutralizes the impact of confounding
factors.
C. Comparison with Previous Studies
Even though previous studies showed some success with
large-scale notiﬁcations, our results show little to no impact.
We attribute these to the following factors.
Complexity: Complexity can play a vital role in the success
of notiﬁcation studies. SAV requires signiﬁcant time and ex-
pertise and can cause downtime if not correctly implemented.
Previous studies ( [27], [76], [77]) notiﬁed hosting providers
and users about compromised websites which usually re-
quires ﬁxing the access privileges or removing malicious ﬁles.
Similarly, other experiments [78], [79] notiﬁed web admins
about misconﬁgurations or best practices for their domains.
