### Title: Event-based Fuzzing, Patch-based Research, and Comment Policing: Finding Bugs Through Known Vulnerabilities

**Abstract:**

For security researchers, learning from known vulnerabilities is essential. Subscribing to major vendors' monthly public bulletins and security patch updates is a standard practice at the beginning of each month. The value of analyzing these vulnerabilities goes beyond merely identifying attack surfaces and exploit scenarios; it also provides critical insights that can guide deeper investigations and bug hunting.

From our extensive work in security vulnerability analysis and tracking, we have identified several effective approaches for discovering new bugs, applicable to both mature products and customized solutions. These methods have enabled us to develop a targeted fuzzer and create specific CodeQL/Weggli rules, leading to the discovery of numerous security vulnerabilities in Chrome and Android devices.

In this presentation, we will share these patterns, along with the corresponding methodologies and results. Our goal is to provide actionable insights and practical tools that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your security research.
