User: I am trying to use os.system() to call another program that takes an input and an output file. The command I use is ~250 characters due to the long folder names. 
When I try to call the command, I'm getting an error: The input line is too long.
I'm guessing there's a 255 character limit (its built using a C system call, but I couldn't find the limitations on that either).
I tried changing the directory with os.chdir() to reduce the folder trail lengths, but when I try using os.system() with "..\folder\filename" it apparently can't handle relative path names. Is there any way to get around this limit or get it to recognize relative paths?
Assistant: I got the same message but it was strange because the command was not that long (130 characters) and it used to work, it just stopped working one day.
I just closed the command window and opened a new one and it worked.
I have had the command window opened for a long time (maybe months, it's a remote virtual machine).
I guess is some windows bug with a buffer or something.
