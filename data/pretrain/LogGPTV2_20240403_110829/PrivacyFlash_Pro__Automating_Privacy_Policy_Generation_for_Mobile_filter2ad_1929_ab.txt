the opacity of third party ad and analytics libraries [14].
Developers often do not feel responsible for managing and
addressing consumer risks from integrating such libraries [45].
Developer tools may reduce the barriers for app developers
to implement privacy and security best practices [14]. To
support Android developers in writing better code, FixDroid,
an Android Studio plugin, highlights security- and privacy-
related code problems, provides an explanation to developers,
and suggests quickﬁx options [50]. Similarly, Coconut, another
Android Studio plugin, highlights potential privacy problems
and offers quickﬁxes [38]. The information provided to the

same is true for PrivacyStreams, an implementation of a

PrivacyStreams provides an API on top of the Android API
that highlights privacy-related code usage, although, it does
not account for third party libraries.
III. QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED POLICY GENERATORS
Questionnaire-based policy generators guide developers
through a privacy questionnaire and are intended to generate
a compliant privacy policy from the supplied answers.
A. Generator and Policy Selection
We set out to review six popular questionnaire-based gen-
erators for creating mobile app privacy policies: App Privacy
Policy Generator [7], FreePrivacyPolicy [32], iubenda [35],
PrivacyPolicies [53], Termly [69], and TermsFeed [70]. The
market is quite small but increasing. We are only consid-
ering generators covering mobile apps.2 During our evalua-
tion we found that three generators — TermsFeed, FreeP-
rivacyPolicy, and PrivacyPolicies (in the following, Terms-
Feed et al.) — are provided by the same entity and seem
to generate identical policies. This relationship is not
im-
mediately obvious but was conﬁrmed to us by the op-
erator, who also explained that TermsFeed is their main
offering. Neither of
the generators we review has any
code analysis functionality.
to collect policies
from the questionnaire-based generators we started with a
Google search. For example, searching for ios iubenda
site:https://itunes.apple.com/ returned numer-
ous search results for policies of iOS apps in Apple’s App
Store generated with iubenda [35]. We collected policies in
the order they appeared in the search results given they were
(1) in English,3 (2) associated with a free iOS app on the US
App Store, (3) linked from an app’s App Store page, and (4)
hosted on the generator site or appearing to be generated with
the generator.
In order
To ensure that
the policies were in fact generated by
the generators and not modiﬁed by the developers we are
relying on the generators’ hosting features. All generators but
one offer the option to host the generated policies on their

services 3dcart [1] and Shopify [62] as they are only covering websites.
3Some generators support generation of policies in multiple languages.

servers so they can update the policies in case of changes
in the legal environment. The App Privacy Policy Generator
is the only generator not offering hosting. However, policies
from this generator include a reference disclosing that “[t]his
privacy policy page was created at privacypolicytemplate.net
and modiﬁed/generated by App Privacy Policy Generator.”
All policies we are examining from this generator contained
such reference and do not appear modiﬁed. We also generated
multiple policies from each generator on our own to verify the
absence of modiﬁcations in the policies we collected. Using
the generators ourselves let us evaluate how they work and
observe what policies they generate for different questionnaire
answers. Leaving aside the policies we created on our own, we
collected a total of 95 policies from the App Privacy Policy
Generator (20), iubenda (20), Termly (20), and TermsFeed et
al. (35).
B. Privacy Policy Analysis
Generators must be designed so that developers are able
to generate compliant privacy policies. In particular,
they
must be kept up to date with changing laws. All generators
we examined, except for the App Privacy Policy Generator,
advertised on their websites to generate policies compliant with
the CCPA, COPPA, and GDPR. However, in our initial analysis
in May 2020 we found that all generators had substantial short-
comings, for example, they failed to create CCPA-compliant
policies. Table I shows tallies of generators’ compliance with
legal requirements in May 2020. It also shows tallies of
our second analysis in January 2021 after we had contacted
the generator operators.4 In May 2020 policies generated
with Termly were only compliant with 3 out of 18 CCPA
requirements. Similarly, policies generated with TermsFeed et
al. were only compliant with 5 out of 18 CCPA requirements.
For example, neither policy generated with iubenda, Termly,
or TermsFeed et al. provided a list of categories of personal
information disclosed for business purpose in the preceding 12
months per CCPA §1798.130(a)(5)(C).
The non-compliance was independent of the answers pro-
vided in the generators’ privacy questionnaires. It was the
design of the generators that did not sufﬁciently accommodate
the CCPA. Perhaps, the generator operators needed some time
to adapt their questionnaires to the new law. The CCPA became
effective fairly recently in January 1, 2020 after a rather
quick lawmaking process. In our analysis of January 2021
we found that Termly and TermsFeed et al. had adapted their
questionnaires and their policies are now compliant with CCPA
§1798.130(a)(5)(C). To cover this provision a generator would
need to be adapted because it goes beyond the traditional canon
of what a privacy policy usually discloses. On the other hand,
the higher levels of GDPR compliance in our ﬁrst analysis
in May 2020 could be based on the GDPR already being
effective since 2018, after it was well publicized in 2016. The
requirements of the GDPR are also more general than those
of the CCPA and cover disclosures that are often traditionally
included in privacy policies even if they are not GDPR-
speciﬁc, for example, the purposes of the data processing per
GDPR Art. 13(1)(c), 14(1)(c).
4We contacted all generator operators in June 2020 and notiﬁed them of
our ﬁndings. We received a response from a representative at TermsFeed et al.
and further explained our ﬁndings. The representative told us that TermsFeed
et al. is in a process of updating their generator.

TABLE II: CCPA privacy policy requirements and generators’ compliance.
C. Privacy Compliance Analysis
Privacy policies take a long time to read [44]. However,
there would not even be a point in reading a policy if it does
not describe the actual behavior of an app or other piece of
software. In fact, reading it could even be misleading. The
potential misalignments between policies and apps motivate us
to study the extent to which generated policies are susceptive
to such compliance issues. All results in this subsection are
current as of May 2020.
1) The Law on Privacy Compliance: We deﬁne a com-
pliance issue to mean that an app is performing a privacy
practice (e.g., uses location data) while its privacy policy does
not disclose it or discloses the opposite (e.g., discloses that it
is not using location data) [86]. The notion that a policy must
accurately describe the behavior of the app it covers is both
evident as well as explicitly described in the law. Per the CCPA
Regulations [Regs §999.308(a)(1)], it is the purpose of the
policy to provide consumers with a comprehensive description
of online practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and
sale of personal information. Using clear and plain language,
notiﬁcation of data processing practices must be provided in
a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form
[GDPR Art. 12(1)]. Not properly disclosing a practice can be
an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce
[15 USC §45] and result in a privacy enforcement action by
the Federal Trade Commission. The Apple Developer Program
License Agreement also speciﬁes that developers must provide
a privacy policy explaining the collection, use, disclosure,
sharing, retention, and deletion of user or device data [9].
Consequently, Apple’s vetting process for publishing an app on
the App Store includes the identiﬁcation of compliance issues
as well.5
2) Permission Under- and Over-disclosures: The ﬁrst types
of compliance issues we are examining are under- and over-
disclosures of permissions used by apps and their integrated
