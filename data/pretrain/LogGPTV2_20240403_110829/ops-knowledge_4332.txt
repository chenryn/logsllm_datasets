User: I installed a Python package (such as SQLAlchemy), and it compiled C into binaries on a Windows 7 machine. Can I expect to be able to reuse the compiled binaries on Windows Server 2008-R2?
Edit: Both are AMD64 Python 2.7.3 and Windows 64 bit.
Assistant: Yes, but there are other issues you need to watch-out for.  
Are both systems either 32-bit or 64-bit?  Not just the hardware, but the Python version as well.
Are both systems running the same version of Python?  That's tied to both major and minor version numbers (see sys.version_info).
Edit:
Your edit has answered these questions, so you should be fine.  Make sure you keep any Python upgrades and modules in step, and only use the 64-bit versions.
