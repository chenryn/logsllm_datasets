anisms to be developed with churn as a primary concern.
Our work aims at contributing to the conception of realistic
churn assumptions for the development of distributed social
network based solutions.
3. MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSIS
Instant messaging systems such as Skype [1] and Yahoo!
Instant Messenger [6] are used by millions of users everyday.
The whole ecosystem of each such system can essentially be
viewed as a distributed social network. A typical user in such
a system ﬁrst installs a client on her machine, and then adds
friends and acquaintances who are also using the system as
‘contacts’ in order to interact with them. Unlike online so-
cial networks (OSNs) such as Facebook and LinkedIn, these
systems usually do not enable users to access friends of their
friends and beyond, resulting in each user/client having a
very limited knowledge of her neighborhood. This setting
provides a natural environment to motivate design consid-
erations for distributed social network-based approaches. In
this section, we examine some of the dynamics observed in
such systems which can help build more realistic and robust
distributed social network-based systems.
3.1 Skype
While most of the research related to churn in distributed
systems was studied predominantly in the previous decade,
we argue that churn is still an important factor in today’s
distributed systems. To illustrate this importance, we ex-
amine the uptime behavior in one of the world’s largest and
most popular instant messaging systems: Skype [1].
We collected2 from an RSS feed3 on the Skype website [3]
the total number of concurrent Skype users online at a gran-
ularity of 5-minute interval for the duration of 7 months from
February 6, 2014 to August 18, 2014. Figure 2 shows each
data point in this period, with all times shown from the
Central European Time (CET) zone.
We observe the expected diurnal pattern of online users
with the highest concurrency during the early evening and
the lowest in the early morning. Consider an example day
of July 21, 2014. Starting at midnight, the number of con-
current users online is 58 million and dips to the lowest of
the day with 55 million online at 4 AM, and then gradually
increases upto a peak of 81 million online at 6 PM. The num-
ber of concurrent users online then decreases to 61 million
at midnight at the start of the next day. We note that the
highest / lowest concurrency at 6 PM / 4 AM CET coincides
with 12 PM / 10 PM Eastern Time (ET) zone and 9 AM /
7 PM Paciﬁc Time (PT) zone in the United States, which
better explains the day / night online behavior of users.
There is also a weekly pattern in that the concurrent users
peak on Monday and gradually fades through the week until
Saturday. Interestingly, Sunday is not the least active day
which may be due to Saturday, and not Sunday, being the
most common day in the weekend across various countries.
During a week, we observe a min-max of 32-58 and 47-82
million users online at any time prior to June 2014 and post
mid-June 2014, respectively. The week of June 10 saw an
increase of nearly 25 million concurrent users, which may
be due to various factors such as World Cup and/or the
release of a new version of Skype for iPhone [2]. However,
the concurrent usage has since followed a steady pattern.
Based on Microsoft’s Skype Internal Data4, there were
about 240, 300, and 330 million active users every month
in 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively. Extrapolating these

3Since September 2014, we observed that this feed [3] is discontin-
ued. Interestingly, Skype clients which used to show the number
of concurrent users online are no longer displaying the number.
