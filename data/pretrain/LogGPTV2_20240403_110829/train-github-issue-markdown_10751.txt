I tried searching in the issue tracker here but didn't find any, so let me
know if this is a duplicate.
This issue was first brought up in CuPy (cupy/cupy#944) and has regained some
interest, and I believe it's better to be implemented/considered first in
upstream, which downstream libraries like SciPy and CuPy can follow.
The desired effect is to do the normalization opposite to `norm=None`; that
is, the backward/inverse transform is unscaled, and the forward transform is
scaled by 1/n. For a perfectionist's point of view adding this option makes a
lot of sense, as it would cover every possible normalization scheme.
In particular, for GPU libraries like CuPy this could be performance critical
for certain applications, as kernel launching is more costly in the GPU world.
People usually don't do extra work whenever possible, especially if the
normalization is of no interest.
The name `"unnormalized"` can be changed to a more informative one. I don't
have any preference (in fact I'm just a messenger bringing this to NumPy...)
