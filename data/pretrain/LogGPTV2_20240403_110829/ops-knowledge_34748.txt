User: I installed (extracted) Kivy (Kivy-1.9.0-py3.4-win32-x86.exe) on my PC (Win7 32bit). Now whenever trying to run a file using kivy-3.4.bat getting an error message within a window...

python.exe- Entry point not found
The procedure entry point inflateReset2 could not be located in the dynamic link library zlib1.dll.

Once click on the "Ok" button I see

[Critical ] [app] unable to get a window, abort

on CMD.
I think this is a problem related to my system and Python more than Kivy. Can anyone tell me what is the problem and how to solve it?
This is amazing!! Even in StackOverFlow no one could give me any solution!!
Assistant: Yes, I know this post is a bit old, but maybe someone else searches this.
I got the same error. And really, I just tried to start the python script via MS Powershell instead of CMD. I just wanted to use the PS one time.
And it worked, at least for me.
So, if you encounter this error, try to use the Powershell :)
