Question: A company's IT security team is reviewing the security protocols used for their macOS and iOS applications' network connections. They are concerned about the use of outdated encryption algorithms and want to improve their security posture. What would be the consequences of continuing to allow deprecated or insecure protocols?

"B": "Using SHA-1 certificates might be permitted for TLS connections if trusted by the user, even on newer versions of iOS and macOS.",
"C": "Persisting with RSA keys shorter than 2048 bits could prevent TLS connections from being established on updated Apple devices.",
"D": "Continuing to use the RC4 symmetric cipher suite could lead to compatibility issues with devices running iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 or later."
