 **Your Windows build number:**  
10.0.18362.86
**What you're doing and what's happening:**  
Trying to enter the `@` sign on a Swedish keyboard in a PowerShell console
using `Alt Gr` \+ `2`.

**What's wrong / what should be happening instead:**  
Windows terminal shows `digit-argument` instead of outputting the `@` sign as
expected.
It's possible this is a PEBKAC error somehow but the problem doesn't show up
in the normal PowerShell console... ðŸ˜“
