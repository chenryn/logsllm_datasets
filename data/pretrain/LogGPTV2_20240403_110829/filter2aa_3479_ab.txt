– “It was supposed to be a decentralized system, which no one would be in control 
of. It turns out that there were a few organizations which, a few exchanges which 
dominated the market. Almost nobody can mine Bitcoins at the moment. So if you 
want to make any money out of the mining operation, you have to buy these very 
very expensive ASICs. And therefore again, it’s highly centralized.” 
– “If you think about how many cases are reported, in which Bitcoins are stolen from 
computers – from electronic wallets kept in your computer – it shows that the 
currency on the Internet cannot be kept on the Internet, which I find very ironic.”

Whit Diffie (Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange) 
– “I thought indeed in its original vision as a totally decentralized thing, that was 
tremendously exciting. I mean we’ve been trying, we’ve been chasing, […] 
decentralized, anonymous, this, that, and the other electronic banking; now for 
about three decades. So this struck me as a big leap forward in that direction. And 
Bitcoin […] needn't be perfect as a design, there are related designs that attempt 
to debug it. The kind of centralization you’re talking about is very hard to eliminate 
in anything.”

• The strength of Bitcoin crypto primitives is equivalent 
to that for protecting classified information of the USA 
government up to the SECRET level 
• Almost all the possible problems of Bitcoin come from 
its implementations, though the Bitcoin protocol looks 
perfect and its cryptography is strong enough  
Signing of ECDSA 
33 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_DSA  
k : ephemeral key 
Random Number Generators (RNG) 
• With DSA/ECDSA, the entropy, secrecy, and uniqueness of the 
random ephemeral key k is critical  
- Violating any one of the above three requirements can reveal the 
entire private key to an attacker 
- Using the same value twice (even while keeping k secret), using a 
predictable value, or leaking even a few bits of k in each of several 
signatures, is enough to break DSA/ECDSA 
• [December 2010]  The ECDSA private key used by Sony to sign 
software for the PlayStation 3 game console was recovered, 
because Sony implemented k as static instead of random 
• [August 2013]  Bugs in some implementations of the Java class 
SecureRandom sometimes generated collisions in k, allowing in 
stealing bitcoins from the containing wallet on Android app 
• This issue can be prevented by deriving k deterministically from 
the private key and the message hash, as described by RFC 6979

Side Channel Attacks (SCA) 
• A side channel attack is based on information gained 
from the physical implementation of a cryptosystem 
- e.g., timing information, power consumption, 
electromagnetic leaks, or even sound 
• "Almost every smart card you buy today is going to have 
countermeasures to Simple Power Analysis (SPA) and 
Differential Power Analysis (DPA)," said Benjamin Jun, vice 
president of technology at                                        
Cryptography Research, Inc.                                                     
(CRI); however, some newer                                          
implementations of Elliptic                                                     
Curve Cryptosystems (ECC)

Appendix.  The Script about Bitcoin from 
Cryptographers’ Panel, RSA Conference 2014 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMc9fHvc78Y  
*Kocher* {31:57}: As you speak about decentralized systems and splitting trust, that 
brings up the topic in Bitcoin, which has been getting a lot of attention recently. It’s been 
called everything from a dangerous technology that should be banned, to the currency in 
the future, to a great investment, to a bubble. Do you use it? What’s your thought about 
it? Where do you think crypto-currencies will sit in the future? 
*Rivest*: I don’t use it. It’s a fun research topic.  
*Shamir* {32:21}: I think that it is an example of a project which had a lot of potential, 
but almost everything that could go wrong with it did. Let’s look at some of the aspects. 
It was supposed to be a decentralized system, which no one would be in control of. It 
turns out that there were a few organizations which, a few exchanges which dominated 
the market. Almost nobody can mine Bitcoins at the moment. So if you want to make any 
money out of the mining operation, you have to buy these very very expensive ASICs. 
And therefore again, it’s highly centralized. Almost everything is highly centralized. If you 
think about how many cases are reported, in which Bitcoins are stolen from computers – 
from electronic wallets kept in your computer – it shows that the currency on the 
Internet cannot be kept on the Internet, which I find very ironic. 
69 
*Diffie* {33:33}: I thought indeed in its original vision as a totally decentralized thing, 
that was tremendously exciting. I mean we’ve been trying, we’ve been chasing, some 
people particularly chasing the will of the wisp of electronic, decentralized, anonymous, 
this, that, and the other electronic banking; now for about three decades. So this struck 
me as a big leap forward in that direction. And Bitcoin is now just one, you know, it 
needn't be perfect as a design, there are related designs that attempt to debug it. The 
kind of centralization you’re talking about is very hard to eliminate in anything. Biology 
does fairly well. But if you go one level deeper, you find the heavy elements 
manufactured in supernovas, which are expensive, right? So whether you can build, a 
competitive society, whatever, that doesn’t have centralized resources; whether that can 
out-compete one that does, I think it is very far from clear.  
*LaMacchia* {34:36}: So first I don’t use Bitcoin currently. I played around a little bit just 
to try mining early on, didn’t really find anything. And I will admit that when the coin – 
when it got above a thousand dollars a Bitcoin, I did the digital equivalent of hunting 
around in the cushions of your couch, looking to see if I had managed to leave any little 
digital coins around. Cause it would have been interesting though I didn't have anything 
left on disk. But what I find most interesting is the amount of computing power that’s 
going into it. So I did a quick check last night. You go to blockchain.org [blockchain.info 
actually] which publishes all the stats on the Bitcoin blocks. And currently the Bitcoin 
mining network is generating about 29 million giga-hashes per second. That’s about 2 to 
the 55 [255] hashes, SHA-2 hashes, per second is going into this effort. 
*Diffie*: […] reading someone's DES traffic. 
70 
*LaMacchia*: Well that’s the point. If you have that much of compute power that's been 
specialized you can basically apply it to a DES key in a second or two. Or finding SHA-1 
collisions if the theoretical bounds under 2 to 64 [264] are correct, could do it in under an 
hour of time. So there is a lot of compute power that’s being thrown into this.  
*Rivest* {35:46}: So we're getting security because those resources are not being devoted 
towards breaking these cryptosystems, but they're off doing Bitcoin things. Right? […]  
*LaMacchia*: Something like a honey-pot.  
*Shamir*: I’m actually surprised that the green movement is not trying to intervene, 
because so much electricity is being lost making their Bitcoins that somebody should do it.  
*Rivest* {36:07}: That‘s a great technical question as how do you implement something 
like the Bitcoin public ledger in a way that doesn’t waste all this electricity. I‘d love to see a 
good solution to that. Following up on that just a little bit if I may: I think there’s a 
convergence of interest here between Bitcoin and some other applications. In Bitcoin 
you‘ve got this distributed public ledger basically where you can append records at the 
end of that. That abstraction is one that we see in other applications as well. The 
certificate transparency project by Google has the same abstraction needed. And also a lot 
of electronic voting applications need a public ledger where you can append only and so 
on to. So I think we’re seeing an identification of a common abstraction we need to have 
well implemented. I think the Bitcoin implementation is wasteful for electricity. If we can 
solve that problem of doing what‘s done there without the electricity waste, we may have 
a home-run. {36:59}
