attack surface. This mitigation is an effective way to make it more difficult for attackers but does not
minimize operational risk to zero. Attack surface reduction efforts are good at limiting a threat's
ability to operate but do not measure a threat's ability to impact an organization. Penetration tests
should be considered an effort in attack path validation with a goal to reduce the attack surface.
Penetration tests are often driven to support audit requirements, such as those for PCI/DSS[9] or
HIPAA[10]. Red Teaming is typically not driven by compliance but by the desire to fully test an
organization's ability to defend, respond, and react to a threat.
Risk to business operations is arguably the most critical consideration in measuring overall security
risk. Security assessments that map findings and observations to operational risk can gain the support
needed to make a significant improvement. Let's compare these types of assessments in terms of
operational risk. An inverted triangle can illustrate the relationship of Red Teaming, Penetration
Testing, and Vulnerability Assessments in terms of organizational or operational risk. The depth and
breadth of each security assessment type, as can be seen, is quite different.
Vulnerability assessments tend to be broad in coverage but narrow in scope. Consider a vulnerability
assessment of where the goal is to measure all workstations in an enterprise. The scope is very broad
but not very deep in the context of organizational risks. What can be said about the risk to operations
when flaws are identified? Organizational risk can only be understood at the workstation level? The
overall risk to an organization can be extrapolated to some degree but generally stays at that
workstation level. Vulnerability assessments are good at reducing attack surface but do not provide
much detail in terms of organizational risk. This common misunderstanding leads to vulnerability
assessment being used to mismeasure security risk.
Penetrations tests take vulnerability assessments to the next level by exploiting and proving out attack
paths. Although penetration tests may often look and feel like a red team engagement at the technical
level, the critical difference lies in the goals and intent. The purpose of a penetration test is to execute
an attack against a target system to identify and measure risks associated with the exploitation of a
target's attack surface. Consider a penetration test against the external boundary of a network. A
penetration tester exploits an identified flaw that allows inbound access to the target organization.
From a penetration testing standpoint, this was the identification of a deficiency. What does this mean
to the organization? What is the risk? If this flaw is mitigated, how does this impact organizational
risk? The organizational risks can be indirectly measured as a flaw that allows a threat to gain remote
access, but more severe risks to operations must be extrapolated from this attack. Mitigation will help
address technical deficiencies and reduce the attack surface. What about the people and processes or
detection and response actions? Will this type of attack be detected in the future, or is the organization
playing a "whack-a-mole" game with individual vulnerabilities? Plugging holes is good and does
reduce the attack surface, but this is where red teaming enters. Red Teaming focuses on security
operations as a whole and includes people, processes, and technology. Red teaming focuses explicitly
on goals related to training blue teams or measuring how security operations can impact a threat's
ability to operate. Technical flaws are secondary to understanding how the threat was able to impact
an organization's operations or how security operations were able to impact a threat's ability to
operate.

Red Teaming Organizations
The NIST has provided general guidance in the form of the Cybersecurity Framework[11] for
improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity. This framework provides a common taxonomy and
mechanism for organizations to:
1. Describe their current cybersecurity posture
2. Describe their target state for cybersecurity
3. Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a
continuous and repeatable process
4. Assess progress toward the target state
5. Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk
This framework presents industry standards, guidelines, and practices in a manner that allows for
communication of cybersecurity activities and outcomes across the organization from the executive
level to the implementation/operations level. The framework core consists of five concurrent and
continuous functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover. When considered together, these
functions provide a high-level, strategic view of the lifecycle of an organization's management of
cybersecurity risk. The framework core identifies underlying key categories and subcategories for
each function. It matches them with example informative references, such as existing standards,
guidelines, and practices for each subcategory. For more details, visit
https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-faqs-framework-components.
In terms of Red Teaming, this document focuses on how Red Teaming can be used by an organization
to understand its ability to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover against a threat. These
categories are where we in the security industry should focus. Detection and response capabilities are
vital and arguably the point of a security operations.
Identify – The Identify Function are foundational for effective use of the Framework. The
organization has associated business context, functions, assets, people and technologies with potential
weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and threats to ascertain risks.
Protect – The Protect function supports the ability to limit or contain the impact of a potential
cybersecurity event. The organization is prepared and configured to prevent intrusion, exploitation, or
manipulation of information.
Detect – The Detect function enables the timely discovery of cybersecurity events. The organization
conducts reliable monitoring and identification of unauthorized activity or entities.
Respond – The Respond function supports the ability to contain the impact of a potential
cybersecurity incident. The organization performs accurate identification and analysis of detected
activities resulting in effective reporting and responses.
Recover – The Recover function supports timely recovery to normal operations to reduce the impact
from a cybersecurity incident. Capabilities are effectively restored when operational
processes/productions have been impaired.
This diagram helps illustrate IPDRR coverage per engagement type.
Vulnerability assessments provide an organization the measure or understand the ability to identify or
protect against a threat. This great but does not provide the means to understand security operations as
a whole. Vulnerability assessments tend to focus on preventive controls.
Because penetration testing focuses on attack path validation, they can be used to measure not only
identification or protection but detection of threat activity and possibly a bit of response. In general,
penetration tests are scoped for maximum coverage is a relatively short time. These tests lead to
further understanding of protection and detection against threat activity but do little to understand
response or recovery.
Red Teaming allows an organization to explore all aspects of threat activity fully. Red Teaming
provides the needed stimulation to engage security operations as a whole. Red Teaming can employ
an organization to enable security operations (Blue Team) to utilize their TTPs through identification,
protection, detection, response, and recovery from a threat. The level of measurement is shaped by
the engagement plan and determined by the goals.
Key Chapter Takeaways
Red Teaming is the process of using Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to emulate a real-
world threat with the goals of training and measuring the effectiveness of the people, processes, and
technology used to defend an environment.
Red teaming focuses on goals related to training blue teams or measuring how security operations can
impact a threat's ability to operate. Technical flaws are secondary to understanding how the threat
was able to impact an organization's operations or how security operations were able to impact a
threat's ability to operate. Vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are focus on technical flaws
that result in mitigation and attack surface reduction.
Consider This
Red Teaming may use offensive security techniques but is
not offensive in nature. It is arguably part of the security
defensive community.
Red cannot exist without Blue
Homework
1. Develop a lexicon of terms to maintain a common unbiased base of understanding
that can be shared and referenced among internal and external stakeholders.
2. Create or adopt a definition of red teaming and store in the lexicon.
3. Adopt the “Is” vs “Should be” approach when developing threat-based scenarios
4. Perform the Adversarial Mindset Challenge in the Appendix to better understand
the adversarial point of view.
Engagement Planning
All engagements must start with Engagement Planning, the first step in a Red Team engagement. It is
not possible to conduct a professional and successful execution without fully understanding the goals
and scope of the engagement, understanding the resources required to execute, and creating a solid
plan.
Cost and Funding
As with any security effort, cost and funding are significant influencers in planning, scheduling, and
executing a Red Team engagement. Several factors contribute to the overall cost and scope of an
engagement. Each element should be carefully reviewed and documented explicitly in a contract or
agreement. Regardless of team status (internal or external service provider), each factor applies.
Scope
Scope plays the most significant role in the overall cost of an engagement. Consider scoping a
vulnerability assessment. There is often a considerable benefit and need to conduct a full-scope, in-
depth review of every node in an environment. The equipment and software employed are usually
part of the price (less additional licensing requirements), setup and configuration are already being
conducted, and the addition of target space to the contract is generally cost-effective. This scoping
effort is arguably straight forward and typically broken into the asset type being assessed. Scoping
could be split into workstations, servers, network components, or any logical asset category.
Now consider scoping a Red Team engagement. There are significant differences between an in-depth
assessment of 1,000 nodes vs. one of 14,000 nodes. Accurate assumptions about the environment can
be made based upon the data obtained from a few similar nodes; however, this data does not
necessarily enable the Red Team to meet the objectives of the engagement. In general, as a target
environment grows, so does the complexity of its security controls (and ideally its effectiveness).
Sometimes, that complexity benefits the environment. Other times, it introduces weaknesses a Red
Team may use advantageously to gain access or achieve threat-based goals. In either case, the Red
Team has to manage the complexity of tactics to test and validate the overall threat strategy accurately.
Red Teams are known for leveraging multiple systems or data points and "bending" configurations to
meet the engagement's needs. Common security tools and applications don't regularly discover many
of these flaws or paths. This understanding drives scope development toward a scenario rather than
testing every node in a target environment using standard security testing tools. The scope should
always directly and effectively support the operational objectives being measured.
Duration
The duration can be a set time frame as determined by the target or the Red Team; however, it is
recommended that duration be set after the target objectives, requirements, and scope are determined.
A realistic time frame can then be placed in the context of the scope, and be increased or decreased
as required. It is essential not to use the timeframe to set scope. Arbitrarily setting a deadline can
negatively impact the quality of an engagement scope by imposing artificial constraints. Although this
is best practice, and duration should be set after the goals and scope are determined, it is helpful to
have guidelines. You can use a period of two to four weeks for most engagements. This is a good
starting point but must be adjusted based on the actual scope.
Focus Area
The two-to-four week recommendation is for estimating an
individual engagement, which may be part of a larger
campaign composed of multiple engagements. The goals
must be considered when determining scope duration.
Personnel Labor Cost
Simultaneously while determining the scope and duration, Red Team leadership should estimate the
number of personnel required for an engagement. These steps must be simultaneous as they depend on
each other. When sizing a Red Team, you must consider the number, size, and length of engagements.
The most basic Red Team engagement will consist of at least two individuals. A recommended
standard starting size for planning is four individuals: three operators and one lead. Adjust the
number up or down based on the size, length, and goals.
How can you adjust the scope using a factor of time or personnel? Consider this example; an
engagement is scoped for six weeks using three operators against a target network that has 14,000
nodes. This engagement could be extended to eight weeks by reducing operators or may be reduced to
four weeks by adding staff. This elasticity of time and personnel should be considered when planning
to help address finance, schedule, and other limitations. There are limits and diminishing returns to
this elasticity. Adjustments could compromise the ability to achieve engagement goals. It is
recommended to always have a minimum of two dedicated operators for an engagement.
Equipment and Software Cost
Red Teams must maintain a common toolset ready to be leveraged on any engagement. The toolset can
be comprised of both free and paid tools. This toolset can be further customized to meet the specific
needs once an engagement has been scoped (or contracted if external). During many engagements, a
target has an obscure piece of equipment, tool, or software within the target environment that requires
a specialized hardware device or software interface. It is recommended that the target provides
access to a reference system for Red Team use to reduce cost. If this option is not available, or the
target decides that a goal is to understand how the Red Team obtains access, the additional overhead
and cost may be rolled into the overall engagement costs. Customization of tools, specialized
software, or hardware must be identified early during scope planning to capture impact to scope.
Travel Cost
Travel cannot be forgotten during planning. Funds must be allocated if an engagement is conducted at
a specific target site or other remote location. These funds must include lodging, flights, local
transportation, per diem costs, and miscellaneous expenses. For U.S. based teams, following GSA
travel and per diem rates can be a good starting point to set travel budgets. Many organizations will
use these rates and optionally add a percentage as a benefit and incentive to lessen the stress and
burden of travel. For instance, it can be common to use GSA rates x 1.25. This has been a successful
method to provide operators a good rate to cover lodging, meals, and incidentals.
Pre- and Post-Engagement Cost
Inexperienced teams often fail to allocate time and funds for pre- and post-engagement (non-execution
time) activities. Most engagements require some form of information or intelligence gathering
(OSINT), and passive target reconnaissance before execution. They also need time for infrastructure
preparation and, occasionally, custom tool development. They all require planning before execution
and analysis and reporting following execution. Don't forget to account for these efforts in the
planning and costing/budgeting process.
This section does not cover every possible element required to appropriately budget, fund, or quote a
Red Team engagement. It is written to prompt thought and discussion on the actual costs and expected
line items of an engagement. Actual planning takes time and repetition to develop an effective
process.
Frequency
A Red Team engagement can be a very stressful experience. People can react negatively or
defensively when their character, tools, or processes are brought into question. Even a well-managed
engagement where individual attribution is kept to a minimum can place tremendous stress on staff.
Doing this too often may not provide the organization time to apply mitigations, may cause the
organization to treat the results with little regard, or result in poor morale and few positive benefits.
Testing too infrequently can be just as damaging as testing too frequently. When testing is conducted
too infrequently, the organization can become complacent and lax in its security operations. Red Team
engagements typically fall into three categories: Single, Periodic, or Continuous. The appropriate
frequency depends on the target organization and the goals of the engagement.
Single
Performing a Red Team engagement as a single activity is typically done for organizations new to Red
Teaming or those with large footprints and limited resources. It allows them to get their feet wet
without a significant commitment. A one-time engagement can be as simple or complex as needed.
Organizations that desire a one-time Red Team engagement may not know specifically what they need.
An effective Red Team will interview and question an organization's management to best determine
the need and requirement. If the Red Team does not guide this discussion, an engagement is likely to
be at risk of becoming just another vulnerability assessment or penetration test. One-time engagements
are a great way to introduce organizations to Red Teaming as long as the planning is managed and
focused on Red Teaming goals and objectives.
Periodic
Periodic, annual, or bi-annual Red Team engagements are very common. Mature organizations that
perform comprehensive Red Team engagements balance the stimulus needed to keep security
operations sharp and the time needed to improve defenses. When performing an annual engagement,
be cautious not to treat it as a compliance audit. It will be tempting to just go through the motions.
When testing becomes routine, an organization may not treat the results as seriously as a one-off test.
To combat this complacency, engagements should be challenging and engaging. They should focus on
severe areas of risk and not be "just another test to see if the bad guys can get in." Focused scenarios,
the strategic use of white carding (to be discussed later), and incorporating current threats will keep
an engagement fresh and provide better results.
Continuous
Continuous Red Teaming is a newer concept. Think of this as persistent threat emulation. When an
organization has a Red Team constantly attacking and engaging its network, it can understand
weaknesses associated with long-term advanced and persistent threats. Constant does not mean 24
hours a day / 365 days a year. It means that a Red Team's goals are spread out over some time. Goals
could be in weeks, months, or even years instead of over a one or two-week engagements. This
approach allows a team to perform more realistic actions, attempt to remain in the network for a more
extended period, and position themselves in ways a real threat would use to cause severe damage to
an organization. They are also able to emulate actual threat activities and timelines. In this model,
what happens if the team is not detected? The team can use operational impacts. These are the steps
taken to impact an organization to elicit a response directly. A Red Team can expose their activity just
enough to cause a reaction from security operations. Red Teams can turn up or down their activity as
