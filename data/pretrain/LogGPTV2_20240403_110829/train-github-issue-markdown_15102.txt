This RFC is regarding distributing typedef files with React. While this would
be generally useful (and possibly useful to extract the React.js definitions
out of flow itself (especially for renderer-implementers), it would be
especially nice for renderer implementers.
(I have manually extracted the minimal required for a react renderer in
https://github.com/iamdustan/tiny-react-renderer/tree/fiber/src/fiber-types)
Possible solutions:
  * ensure `flow gen-flow-files ....` works and generates all of the `*.js.flow` files in packages
  * add a custom step to the build tooling to include the public renderer type def for each public package + a minimal typedef for `ReactFiberReconciler.js` in each package that receives that file.
