The web-based applications can be useful to support enterprise testing as well as
specific attacks against web applications. The five applications are as follows:
• TWiki: This is a wiki application that supports enterprise collaboration
during the testing process; it uses structured content to create simple
workflow systems
• phpmyadmin: Allows remote administration of MySQL databases over
the Web
• webdav: The Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning set of
extensions to the HTTP protocol, which allows users to collaboratively edit
and manage files on remote web servers
• Mutillidae: A vulnerable web-hacking application composed of PHP scripts
that are vulnerable to the top 10 vulnerabilities of OWASP
As you can see in the following screen excerpt, the top 10 vulnerabilities
are available in a drop-down menu. For example, selecting the option
A2 - Cross Site Scripting (XSS) gives you access to submenus matched to
specific vulnerability types (Reflected, Persistent, DOM Injection, and so on).
[ 324 ]
Appendix
The database specified in the Mutillidae configuration file is
incorrect, and you may receive multiple errors for operations that
require database access. To fix these, log in to Metasploitable2 and
edit the /var/www/mutillidae/config.inc file; change the
dbname field from metasploit to owasp10.
• Finally, the Metasploitable framework launches the Damn Vulnerable Web
Application (DVWA) that provides a different set of challenges to practice
attacks against specific vulnerabilities.
Other vulnerable web-based apps that have been well characterized include
the following:
• Hackxor: This is a web application hacking game that forces players to
progress through a story to solve challenges related to various vulnerabilities
(http://hackxor.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/index.pl).
• Foundstone: This has released a series of vulnerable web applications,
including a bank, bookstore, casino, shipping, and a travel site
(www.mcafee.com/us/downloads/free-tools/index.aspx).
• LAMPSecurity: This provides a series of vulnerable VMs designed to teach
Linux, Apache, PHP, and database security (http://sourceforge.net/
projects/lampsecurity/files/).

Installing Kali Linux
• OWASP Broken Web Applications Project: This is a collection of
vulnerable web applications (http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/).
• WebGoat: This is an insecure J2EE web application that attempts to
provide a realistic testing environment. It is maintained by OWASP
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_WebGoat_Project).
• Web Security Dojo: This training application released by Maven Security
(https://www.mavensecurity.com/web_security_dojo/), contains
several target images, including Damn Vulnerable Web App, Google's
Gruyere, Hackme's Casino, OWASP's Insecure Web App and WebGoat,
w3af's test website, and several vulnerability-specific targets. It also contains
a toolset to support exploitation.
