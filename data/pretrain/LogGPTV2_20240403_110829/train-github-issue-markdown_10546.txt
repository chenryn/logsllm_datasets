If I have `abstract Foo` and `type Bar<:Foo ... end`, `type Baz<:Foo ... end`,
how should I denote a `Vector` accepting only any _subtypes themselves_ (not
instances) of `Foo` type?
This trick works:
    typealias FooType{T<:Foo} Type{T}
    v = Vector{FooType}
    push!(v, Bar)
    push!(v, Baz)
    push!(v, Real) # throws an error as expected
But it would be nice to express that in-place, like
`Vector{Type{T<:Component}{T}}` (not sure about concrete syntax, but you've
got an idea)
