    THING
That end up with the following image in playwright because I try to mock my
api and it's not up  
![image](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/3164314/252685402-3b7a41c0-9796-4ede-a811-fb979ea91f93.png)
with my following test, only a 404 explaining my image can't be found (normal)
    test("TEST", async ({ page }) => {
      await page.goto('index.html');
    })

           use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge', baseURL: 'http://localhost:4200/' },

          status: 200,
          path: "screenshot.png",
        });
      });
      await page.goto('index.html');
    })
