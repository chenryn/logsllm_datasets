Subject: Issue with Symfony Converting 201 Response to 302 Redirect

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

In the current project, we are utilizing Symfony as a middleware between a Java WebService and the browser. We have encountered an unexpected behavior where Symfony converts a 201 (Created) response received from the WebService into a 302 (Found) redirect.

I am not entirely sure why this is happening, but I have found some relevant information that might be helpful:

- Symfony's `Response` class: [Line 1129](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.php#L1129)
- RFC 7231, Section 7.1.2: [Status Code Definitions](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2)

If anyone has any suggestions or insights into why this might be occurring, it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
