Hello All,
In a project that I am working on, we are using Symfony as a middleware
between the Java WebService and the browser.
Strangely Symfony converts a 201 response received from the WebService to a
302 Redirect.
I am not sure if this is the reason why this is happening.  
https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/HttpFoundation/Response.php#L1129
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.2
Any suggestions would be of great help.  
Thanks in advance.
