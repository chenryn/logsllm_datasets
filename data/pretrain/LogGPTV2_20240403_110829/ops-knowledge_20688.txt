User: I wanted to pip install Toree package, but I ended up with the following error msg:

Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement toree (from
  versions: ) No matching distribution found for toree

I couldn't find any documentation on requirements for toree. Also, pip doesn't seem to be the issue here either since it successfully installed other packages I tested.
Here are my systems: 
1. Mac 10.11.16 
2. Pip 9.0.1 
3. Python 3.5
Assistant: my situation is similier to you,your jupyter client version is higher than the toree can find,try uninstalled jupyter client before.
