User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题postgres not starting after reboot on ubuntu I'm not familiar with ubuntu (raring), so could someone help me please:

I'm using postgresql 9.1 from apt. It installed the appropriate init script in /etc/init.d/postgresql. I can start the server manually using the script. However, postgres is not started on boot. I issued a update-rc.d postgresql defaults and update-rc.d postgresql enable (as root) but that did not help. 

Is there a specific boot log as i could not find anything in syslog? Thanks guys

EDIT2: OK, the problem seems to be a sysvinit vs. upstart problem. If I remove the symlinks in /etc/rcX: 

sudo update-rc.d -f remove postgresql


and add a upstart script to start postgresql, it starts on boot as expected. As the postgresql is from the official apt repo I wonder why it's not working out of the box?

Assistant: Are you using server or desktop version.

Normally Postgres work perfectly out the box on ubuntu, but i always use ubuntu server LTS.  I think to that issue was caused for some inconsistence on the raring version installer.
