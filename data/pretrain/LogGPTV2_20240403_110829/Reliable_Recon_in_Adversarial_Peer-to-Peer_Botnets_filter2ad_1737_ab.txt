## 3.4 Retaliation
Retaliation is another category of active attack where botmasters take action to disable or compromise hosts used for reconnaissance. These retaliatory actions can include denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, as observed in the GameOver Zeus botnet in response to sinkholing attempts [4]. Repeated DoS attacks have also been documented in the Storm botnet in response to takedown and infiltration attempts [6].

## 4. Recon Anomalies
This section analyzes the stealthiness of crawlers and sensors used in the GameOver Zeus and Sality v3 botnets. Unstealthy reconnaissance tools expose themselves to an increased risk of the attacks discussed in Section 3.

### 4.1 Crawler Protocol Anomalies
Our analysis of crawlers is based on data gathered by 512 sensor nodes in the Zeus network (before it was sinkholed) and 64 sensors in the Sality network. The number of Sality sensors is limited by the peer management scheme and our IP range. We announced these sensors for two days and then ran them passively for three weeks until the combined sensor in-degrees matched botnet size estimates [28], ensuring reachability by all crawlers. Our sensor implementations included only protocol logic, with no malicious components, and we verified the legality of our tactics with law enforcement officials.

We identified crawlers using protocol-specific anomaly detection on our sensor data, looking for peers with deviations from normal bot behavior. To define normal behavior, we reverse-engineered Zeus and Sality to establish a ground truth. We cross-verified our list of detected crawlers to ensure that crawlers from our anti-malware industry contacts were correctly identified. While it is impossible to obtain a complete ground truth of crawlers in a live botnet, we established the significance of our results by attributing analyzed crawlers to large malware analysis companies, network security companies, CERTs, and academic researchers. We attributed crawlers using WHOIS data, protocol-specific information (such as bot IDs revealing company names), and inquiries with community contacts. Affected parties were informed via closed mailing lists.

We focused on well-functioning crawlers that cover at least 1% of the bot population (≥ 50 messages to our sensors), including one open-source Zeus crawler belonging to a large network security company. The resulting list of crawlers found by our anomaly detection includes 21 Zeus crawlers and 11 Sality crawlers. We summarize the defects found in these crawlers in Table 2 for Sality and Table 3 for Zeus (anonymized to avoid revealing IPs used by malware analysts). Note that 6 of the 11 Sality crawlers are grouped together into a single column, as they were all running in the same subnet and exhibited the same characteristics (i.e., multiple instances of the same crawler).

#### 4.1.1 Range Anomalies
Crawlers with range anomalies exhibit static or constrained values for message fields that should be randomized. Additionally, range anomalies can occur when crawlers use random values for non-random fields. Our results show that range anomalies are the most common class of defects in Zeus crawlers, with at least one range anomaly found in 20 out of 21 analyzed crawlers.

The Zeus message header contains several fields that are normally randomized, including a random byte at the beginning of each message, the Time to Live (TTL) field (randomized when unused), and the Length of Padding (LOP) field, which indicates the length of the random padding at the end of the message. Furthermore, a random session ID is generated for each request-response pair. In 14 crawlers, the padding length was constrained, possibly to reduce bandwidth usage by limiting the number of padding bytes at the end of each message. Static or constrained random bytes and TTL values each occurred in 10 crawlers, and 11 crawlers used static session IDs or rotated between a small number of session IDs.

On the other hand, we found that 3 Zeus crawlers used random values for the source ID field on each message, which indicates the unique identifier of the bot that sent the message. Although a small variation in source ID per IP address is normal and can indicate multiple bots behind a NAT gateway, these crawlers used over 1000 different source IDs, making them highly detectable.

In Sality, normal messages end with a random amount of padding. However, in all but one of the analyzed Sality crawlers, the padding length was set to a fixed value, and in the remaining crawler, the padding length was constrained to reduce bandwidth usage. Additionally, 10 out of 11 analyzed crawlers sent messages from a fixed port, while ordinary Sality bots use a randomized port per message exchange.

Some types of Sality messages include a bot identifier, which normally does not change while the bot remains up. All of the crawlers we analyzed adhered to these semantics and did not change their identifiers between messages exchanged with our sensors.

#### 4.1.2 Entropy Anomalies
Entropy anomalies occur when multi-byte fields that normally contain high-entropy content are set to non-random values. In the Zeus protocol, such fields include the source ID and session ID, which are SHA-1 hashes, and the random padding bytes at the end of a message. We found 3 crawlers with low-entropy session IDs, 5 crawlers with non-random padding bytes, and 5 crawlers with low-entropy source IDs.
