User: I installed python via brew, and made it my default python. If I run which python, I obtain /usr/local/bin/python. Also pip is installed via brew, which pip returns /usr/local/bin/pip.
I do not remember how I installed ipython, but I didn't do it via brew, since when I type which ipython, I obtain /opt/local/bin/ipython. Is it the OS X version of ipython?
I installed all libraries on this version of ipython, for example I have matplotlib on ipython but not on python. I do not want to re-install everything again on the brew python, rather continue to install libraries on this version of ipython. How can I install new libraries there? For example, Python Image Library, or libjpeg? 
If possible, I would like an exhaustive answer so to understand my problem, and not just a quick fix tip.
Assistant: To transfer all your packages you can use pip to freeze all of your packages installed in ipython and then install them all easily from the file that you put them in.
pip freeze > requirements.txt
then to install them from the file pip install -r requirements.txt
I'm not entirely sure if I understood what you're asking so if this isn't what you want to do please tell me.
