3.4 Fiduciary Sites
Having applied our methodology to a broad set of sites,
we next examined potential sharing of information about
access to sites that manage personal ﬁduciary information.
Users provide private information such as credit cards and
bank account numbers to such sites. We constructed nine
categories of such sites: credit, ﬁnancial, insurance, med-
ical, mortgage, shopping, subscription, travel and utility.
We identiﬁed 81 sites across these nine categories with the
speciﬁc sites for each category.
From a privacy standpoint, it is vital to reduce diﬀusion
of information about access to these categories of sites. We
did not actually login to any of these sites for our testing,
but we assume that users would be most likely to visit the
home page of each site before logging into a site (or being
identiﬁed based on cookies). An interesting piece of future
work would be to examine the diﬀusion of access information
after login to a site has occurred.
Results for the privacy footprint across these 81 sites are
shown in Table 7. The size of the privacy footprint is gen-
erally smaller than the Alexa dataset, both in terms of the
number of associated visible nodes and the distribution of
associations of these visible nodes. Although not shown,
the top hidden nodes are similar to what we found for the
Alexa dataset with domains doubleclick.net, atdmt.com
and 2o7.net as the most connected hidden nodes.
We also looked at the privacy results for these sites us-
ing the categories for each site. Our concern is that a user
could have ﬁduciary interests with a site in each category
and would be particularly concerned if accesses to diﬀerent
categories of sites could be tracked. We found that in terms
of privacy none of the 10 visible nodes in the medical cat-
egory had any associations with other visible nodes in our
dataset. This is a good result in terms of privacy concerns.
It is also possible to construct a set of nine sites, one from
each category, where no site has an association with another
site. A hypothetical user, whom accesses this particular set
of sites would have no privacy concerns. However, at the
other extreme we found it is possible to construct a set of
sites, one from each category, where a site from each of the
non-medical categories is associated with a distinct site in
at least one other category with a mean of ﬁve and a maxi-
mum of six associations with sites in other categories. This
result is consistent whether or not the presence of cookies
is considered. It indicates that it is possible for information
across these categories to be shared.
3.5 Methods to Defeat Tracking
Given the widespread use of hidden nodes that have the
potential to track the browsing behavior of users across a
large number of visible nodes, the last question we investi-
gate is what retrieval methods can be used to defeat such
tracking. In this section we discuss two such methods and
examine their eﬀectiveness in terms of reducing the privacy
footprint. We use the Alexa dataset used for initial work
presented previously in this section.
3.5.1 Ad Blocking
We can block objects used for tracking by treating them
as extraneous content (such as advertisements). Using the
same methodology as in [5], we use the Adblock Firefox ex-
tension [1], which blocks the retrieval of objects whose URL
match one or more pattern rules speciﬁed by the user. Like-
wise, we use a ruleset named “Filterset.G” [4], which is com-
monly accepted as best practice for using Adblock to block
extraneous content. For this analysis we used the 2006-03-
08 Filterset.G ruleset version and converted the rules to Perl
regular expressions (Perl and JavaScript use the same regu-
lar expression syntax) and ﬁltered out all objects matching
at least one rule.
Table 8 shows the privacy footprint results for the Alexa
dataset with all URls that match a Filterset.G rule being ﬁl-
tered out. Comparing the alledges results in this table with
those in Table 5, we see that the mean number of associa-
tions for a visible node using the adns merger have dropped
roughly 50% and have dropped roughly two-thirds for the
domain merger approach. The cookie-only based results in
the lower-half of Table 8 show a more signiﬁcant drop when
compared to cookie-only results in Table 5.
These results indicate that ad blocking techniques can sig-
niﬁcantly reduce the potential tracking by hidden nodes, but
not eliminate it. Filtering eliminates many of the domains
shown in Tables 1 and 6, but objects from domains such
as 2mdn.net, revsci.net and webtrendsalive.com are not
ﬁltered.

The adns footprint in Table 8 is larger across all metrics
than the domain footprint because the adns approach com-
bines servers that are syntactically distinct, but share the
same set of ADNSs. The largest ADNS node when consider-
ing cookie-only results is one connected to yahoo.com sites
as well as sites in the burstnet.com domain. The second
largest ADNS set is for an Akamai ADNS serving objects
with cookies for diﬀerent visible nodes.
The results show that standard ad blocking techniques
improve on, but do not eliminate, privacy concerns. The
reasons for these mixed results are that not all objects used
for tracking may appear to be an “ad” and that not all
associations among servers used for tracking may be evident
based solely on a server name.
3.5.2 Blacklisting Top Hidden Nodes
The previous results show that blocking ads may not be
the best approach for reducing tracking. A more direct ap-
proach is to identify the most frequently-used hidden nodes
and simply block retrieval of all objects from these nodes.
Table 9 shows the results of applying this direct approach
where all objects belonging to one of the top-10 hidden node
domains shown in Tables 1 and 6 are ﬁltered.

The results in Table 9 show small variations with the Ad-
block results in Table 8, but overall the footprint results
are similar. The results do not improve because even with
the top hidden nodes ﬁltered out with the blacklist method,
there are still many other hidden nodes to interconnect the
visible nodes. This result indicates that visible nodes are
often associated via multiple hidden nodes.
4. CONCLUSIONS
Privacy is a central concern of users in the Internet and
this work examines one privacy issue—the potential to track
and correlate knowledge about a user’s actions across seem-
ingly unrelated Web sites. We used an approach that deﬁnes
edges between the “visible” nodes, which are the servers that
users directly access, and the “hidden” nodes, which are the
servers that are accessed as a result accessing a visible node.
We use this approach as a basis to deﬁne and construct a pri-
vacy footprint, which monitors the diﬀusion of information
about a user’s actions by measuring the number of associa-
tions between visible nodes via one or more common hidden
nodes.
The privacy footprint metric can be computed in a straight-
forward manner, augmentable over time, and is comparable
across individuals and organizations. The openness of the
Web, the ﬂexibility and extensibility of modern browsers
like Firefox, allow us to construct tools that can carry out
measurements concurrent with normal browsing by the user.
Using the footprint for a set of popular sites, we found
that the mean number of associated sites has increased by
50% in the past six months. This is a signiﬁcant increase
in a relatively short time. Narrowing our examination just
to sites that supply cookies indicates that the privacy foot-
print is still extensive. Our results show that the size of the
privacy footprint is a legitimate cause for concern across all
sets of sites that we studied.
We found that methods such as ad blocking and blacklist-
ing of hidden nodes to defeat tracking of user actions across
Web sites are only partially eﬀective due to diﬃculties in
identifying all hidden nodes and in identifying organizational
dependencies amongst these nodes.
For future work, we believe an alternate approach to con-
sider is a “ﬁlter-in” technique, which by default whitelists
servers in the domain of the visible node. This technique is
simpler to specify and, based on preliminary investigation,
more eﬀective compared to other methods in limiting the
privacy footprint. However, we need to examine usability
concerns of this technique and we found it needs to be aug-
mented with a whitelist of allowed hidden nodes as well as
knowledge of hidden nodes associated via shared ADNSs.
We plan to build or extend an existing browser extension to
provide this functionality.
In conjunction with this technique, we plan to pursue de-
velopment of an extension to actively monitor and alert the
user of any associations made between visible nodes as a user
browses the Web. In this work, we gather information and
then perform oﬀ-line analysis to determine associations. An
extension that performs this work in real-time would both be
valuable for users to understand the spread of information
about them and could be used as input for ﬁltering rules.
Finally, the deﬁnition of a privacy footprint provides us a
basis on which to continue to monitor the diﬀusion of privacy
information. We plan to do so for popular sites as users and
content providers adapt their approaches in this important
domain.
