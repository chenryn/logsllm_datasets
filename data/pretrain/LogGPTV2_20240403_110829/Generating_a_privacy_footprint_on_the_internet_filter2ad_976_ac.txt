### 3.4 Fiduciary Sites

After applying our methodology to a broad set of sites, we examined the potential sharing of information about access to sites that manage personal fiduciary information. Users provide private information such as credit card numbers and bank account details to these sites. We categorized these sites into nine categories: credit, financial, insurance, medical, mortgage, shopping, subscription, travel, and utility. We identified 81 sites across these nine categories.

From a privacy perspective, it is crucial to minimize the diffusion of information about access to these categories of sites. For our testing, we did not log in to any of these sites but assumed that users would likely visit the home page before logging in or being identified based on cookies. Future work could examine the diffusion of access information after login.

Table 7 shows the privacy footprint results for these 81 sites. The privacy footprint is generally smaller than the Alexa dataset in terms of both the number of associated visible nodes and the distribution of associations. The top hidden nodes are similar to those found in the Alexa dataset, with domains like doubleclick.net, atdmt.com, and 2o7.net being the most connected.

We also analyzed the privacy results for these sites using their respective categories. Our concern is that a user might have fiduciary interests in each category and would be particularly concerned if accesses to different categories could be tracked. We found that none of the 10 visible nodes in the medical category had any associations with other visible nodes in our dataset, which is a positive result for privacy. It is possible to construct a set of nine sites, one from each category, where no site has an association with another site. A hypothetical user accessing this set of sites would have no privacy concerns. However, at the other extreme, we found it is possible to construct a set of sites, one from each category, where a site from each of the non-medical categories is associated with a distinct site in at least one other category, with a mean of five and a maximum of six associations. This result holds whether or not the presence of cookies is considered, indicating that information across these categories can be shared.

### 3.5 Methods to Defeat Tracking

Given the widespread use of hidden nodes that can track browsing behavior across many visible nodes, we investigated methods to defeat such tracking. In this section, we discuss two methods and examine their effectiveness in reducing the privacy footprint using the Alexa dataset.

#### 3.5.1 Ad Blocking

One method to block tracking objects is to treat them as extraneous content, such as advertisements. We used the Adblock Firefox extension, which blocks the retrieval of objects whose URL matches one or more pattern rules specified by the user. We used the "Filterset.G" ruleset, commonly accepted as best practice for ad blocking. For this analysis, we used the 2006-03-08 Filterset.G ruleset version and converted the rules to Perl regular expressions, filtering out all objects matching at least one rule.

Table 8 shows the privacy footprint results for the Alexa dataset with all URLs matching a Filterset.G rule filtered out. Comparing the all-edges results in this table with those in Table 5, we see that the mean number of associations for a visible node using the adns merger has dropped roughly 50%, and has dropped roughly two-thirds for the domain merger approach. The cookie-only-based results in the lower half of Table 8 show a more significant drop compared to the cookie-only results in Table 5.

These results indicate that ad blocking techniques can significantly reduce the potential tracking by hidden nodes but do not eliminate it. Filtering eliminates many of the domains shown in Tables 1 and 6, but objects from domains such as 2mdn.net, revsci.net, and webtrendsalive.com are not filtered.

### Table 8: Privacy Footprint of 1075 Alexa Web Sites Using Adblock with Filterset.G Rules

| Approach | Visible Nodes with Associations | Number of Associations | Edges/Node (Median, Mean, Max) | Top-10 Hidden Nodes |
|----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| all edges/adns | 795 (75%) | 399 | 227, 343, 55 | 506 |
| all edges/domain | 595 (56%) | 119 | 50, 83, 17 | 327 |
| cookie/adns | 288 (27%) | 91 | 27, 38, 17 | 196 |
| cookie/domain | 274 (26%) | 38 | 17, 32, 18 | 183 |

The adns footprint in Table 8 is larger across all metrics than the domain footprint because the adns approach combines servers that are syntactically distinct but share the same set of ADNSs. The largest ADNS node when considering cookie-only results is one connected to yahoo.com sites and burstnet.com domain. The second-largest ADNS set is for an Akamai ADNS serving objects with cookies for different visible nodes.

The results show that standard ad blocking techniques improve but do not eliminate privacy concerns. This is because not all tracking objects may appear to be an "ad," and not all associations among servers used for tracking may be evident based solely on a server name.

#### 3.5.2 Blacklisting Top Hidden Nodes

Another direct approach is to identify the most frequently-used hidden nodes and block the retrieval of all objects from these nodes. Table 9 shows the results of applying this approach, where all objects belonging to one of the top-10 hidden node domains shown in Tables 1 and 6 are filtered.

### Table 9: Privacy Footprint of 1075 Alexa Web Sites Using Blacklist of Top-10 Hidden Nodes

| Approach | Visible Nodes with Associations | Number of Associations | Edges/Node (Median, Mean, Max) | Top-10 Hidden Nodes |
|----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| all edges/adns | 811 (75%) | 415 | 90, 392, 73 | 450 |
| all edges/domain | 604 (56%) | 108 | 17, 84, 20 | 205 |
| cookie/adns | 374 (34%) | 44 | 14, 32, 18 | 234 |
| cookie/domain | 359 (33%) | 32 | 18, 32, 18 | 195 |

The results in Table 9 show small variations with the Adblock results in Table 8, but overall, the footprint results are similar. The results do not improve significantly because even with the top hidden nodes filtered out, there are still many other hidden nodes to interconnect the visible nodes. This indicates that visible nodes are often associated via multiple hidden nodes.

### 4. Conclusions

Privacy is a central concern for Internet users, and this work examines the potential to track and correlate knowledge about a user's actions across seemingly unrelated websites. We defined edges between "visible" nodes (servers users directly access) and "hidden" nodes (servers accessed as a result of accessing a visible node). We used this approach to define and construct a privacy footprint, which monitors the diffusion of information about a user's actions by measuring the number of associations between visible nodes via one or more common hidden nodes.

The privacy footprint metric is straightforward to compute, augmentable over time, and comparable across individuals and organizations. The openness of the Web and the flexibility and extensibility of modern browsers like Firefox allow us to construct tools that can carry out measurements concurrent with normal browsing.

Using the footprint for a set of popular sites, we found that the mean number of associated sites has increased by 50% in the past six months, a significant increase in a relatively short time. Even narrowing our examination to sites that supply cookies, the privacy footprint remains extensive. Our results show that the size of the privacy footprint is a legitimate cause for concern across all sets of sites we studied.

We found that methods such as ad blocking and blacklisting of hidden nodes to defeat tracking of user actions across websites are only partially effective due to difficulties in identifying all hidden nodes and organizational dependencies among these nodes.

For future work, we believe a "filter-in" technique, which by default whitelists servers in the domain of the visible node, is worth considering. This technique is simpler to specify and, based on preliminary investigation, more effective in limiting the privacy footprint. However, we need to examine usability concerns and found it needs to be augmented with a whitelist of allowed hidden nodes and knowledge of hidden nodes associated via shared ADNSs. We plan to build or extend an existing browser extension to provide this functionality.

In conjunction with this technique, we plan to develop an extension to actively monitor and alert the user of any associations made between visible nodes as they browse the Web. This real-time monitoring would be valuable for users to understand the spread of information about them and could be used as input for filtering rules.

Finally, the definition of a privacy footprint provides a basis for continued monitoring of the diffusion of privacy information. We plan to do so for popular sites as users and content providers adapt their approaches in this important domain.
