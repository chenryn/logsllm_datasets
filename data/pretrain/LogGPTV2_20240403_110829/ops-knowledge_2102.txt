User: Please explain what virtualization technology is and provide a specific application scenario.
Assistant: Virtualization technology refers to the process of dividing a physical computer into multiple independent virtual computers, each of which can run different operating systems and applications. Virtualization technology can improve hardware resource utilization, simplify IT infrastructure management, and support high availability, flexibility and fault tolerance. A specific application scenario of virtualization technology is data center virtualization. In this case, data center administrators can use virtualization software to divide a physical computer into multiple virtual computers, which can then be assigned to different applications and services. Through virtualization technology, data center administrators can better utilize hardware resources, save energy costs, and simplify IT deployment and management. In a virtual environment in a data center, if a virtual computer fails, other virtual computers can continue to operate without being affected, thereby increasing the availability of the system.
