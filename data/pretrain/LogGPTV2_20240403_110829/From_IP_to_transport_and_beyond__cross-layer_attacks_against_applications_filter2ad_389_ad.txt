### Attacker Hijacking Digital Resources

An attacker, rather than the victim, can hijack digital resources such as IP addresses and domains that belong to the victim Local Internet Registry (LIR). This can lead to various Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. For instance, the attacker can block connectivity for RADIUS clients or access to services like secure tunnels. If the attacker cannot forge cryptographic material, such as a certificate to authenticate a RADIUS client, they can redirect the client to a malicious host via cache poisoning. This prevents the client from connecting to the genuine target service, resulting in a failure and lack of service for the victim.

### Internet Measurements

In this section, we analyze the fraction of vulnerable resolvers and nameservers with respect to each DNS poisoning method. We evaluate properties that influence the success of cross-layer attacks against applications. Our measurements show that vulnerabilities do not significantly differ across most application-specific datasets. The key findings are:

- **BGP Sub-Prefix Hijacking**: Vulnerabilities are exceptionally high for eduroam and low for RPKI domains. This may be due to the inherent differences in network sizes (large for universities and small for RPKI repository operators), leading to BGP announcements larger than /24 for large networks and equal to /24 for small networks.
- **Fragmentation Cache Poisoning**: Open resolvers are less vulnerable compared to other resolvers in our dataset. This is likely because the distribution of open resolvers is skewed towards poorly configured devices that cannot handle fragmentation.
- **MX, SRV, NAPTR Records**: Domains with these records, particularly eduroam, are more vulnerable to fragmentation-based cache poisoning than domains in the Alexa Top 1M dataset. This is because responses to ANY queries result in larger packets, often exceeding the minimum MTU limit.

#### 5.1 Vulnerabilities in Resolvers

We test DNS resolvers for vulnerabilities to three cache poisoning methods (Section 3) for different applications. The results are summarized in Table 3.

##### 5.1.1 Dataset

For each application from Section 4, we gather datasets of resolvers used by the front-end systems (e.g., Web clients, Alexa MX records, etc.). To achieve this, we first identify an appropriate dataset of front-end systems and then trigger queries through those systems to discover and test the corresponding resolver.

The datasets used include:
1. Our local university eduroam service.
2. Password recovery of popular infrastructure service providers (all 5 Regional Internet Registries, popular domain registrars, and cloud providers).
3. Domain validation of the most popular Certificate Authorities.
4. Popular CDNs in Alexa Top 100K.
5. SMTP servers of Alexa Top 1M domains.
6. XMPP servers of Alexa Top 1M domains.
7. Web clients gathered via an Ad-network.
8. Open resolvers from Censys.
9. A subset of open resolvers who cache pool.ntp.org.

This resulted in a dataset of 89,924 resolvers in 13,804 ASes associated with 33,418 prefixes. The dataset size is reported in terms of front-end systems (e.g., number of SMTP servers or number of open resolver front-end IP addresses) in Table 3. Vulnerability is reported as the percentage of vulnerable front-end systems. A front-end system is considered vulnerable if any of its resolvers are vulnerable.

##### 5.1.2 Measuring Cache Poisoning Vulnerabilities in Resolvers

**Sub-prefix BGP Hijacks (HijackDNS)**: Many networks filter BGP advertisements with prefixes more specific than /24. We consider an IP address hijackable if it lies inside a network block whose advertised size is larger than /24. We map all resolvers' IP addresses to network blocks and consider those vulnerable to sub-prefix hijacks whose advertisement is larger than /24. For the remaining addresses, BGP-hijack may still be possible using same-prefix hijacks. We perform Internet measurements to check for DNS platforms on prefixes less than /24, using Routeview and RIPE RIS collectors. The results are listed in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 3.

**Same-prefix BGP Hijacks (HijackDNS)**: We simulate same-prefix BGP hijacks using a set of randomly selected attacker and victim AS pairs. The simulator selects Gao-Rexford policy compliant paths and considers prefix lengths and AS-relationships. The simulation shows that the attacking AS was capable of hijacking traffic in 80% of the evaluations.

**SadDNS**: To test resolvers vulnerable to SadDNS, we check the resolvers' back-end IP addresses for a global ICMP message limit. We send an ICMP echo-response ('ping') packet to the resolver first to ensure it is reachable. For the open resolver dataset, we measured a vulnerability rate of 12%, a notable reduction from the 35% rate in the original paper [57]. This difference is likely due to the patching of the vulnerability in many systems.

**FragDNS**: To test vulnerability to fragmentation-based DNS cache poisoning, we use a custom nameserver that emits fragmented responses padded to a certain size. The nameserver is configured to send only CNAME responses in the first fragmented response, allowing us to verify if the resolver is vulnerable. In our datasets, vulnerability rates range between 31% for Open resolvers and 91% for Ad-net resolvers.

### 5.2 Vulnerabilities in Domains

In this section, we measure the vulnerabilities in domains to our cache poisoning methodologies for different applications. We collect lists of domains associated with these applications and test all the nameservers serving each domain according to the required properties for each cache poisoning method. The results are summarized in Table 4.

##### 5.2.1 Dataset

For each application in Section 4, we collect datasets of typical domains looked up by clients (or servers) of that application. The datasets include:
1. Eduroam institution lists from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Austria.
2. Alexa Top 1 Million domains, including subsets with MX and SRV (XMPP) records.
3. Account email addresses from whois databases of RIRs and Registrars.
4. Well-known NTP server domains.
5. Well-known cryptocurrency domains.
6. Well-known RPKI validator database domains.
7. Domains of IKE and OpenVPN servers' certificates.

This resulted in 904,555 domains hosted on 200,086 nameservers in 24,353 ASes associated with 60,511 prefixes.

##### 5.2.2 Measuring Cache Poisoning Vulnerabilities in Nameservers

**HijackDNS**: We perform a similar analysis as in Section 5.1.2 to check the vulnerabilities to BGP prefix hijacks. The results are plotted in Figure 3. The differences between the fractions of nameservers in the Alexa Top 1M domains that can be sub-prefix hijacked are analyzed.
