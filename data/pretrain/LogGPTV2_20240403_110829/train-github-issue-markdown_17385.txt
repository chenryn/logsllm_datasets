I attempted to use the latest stable version of TypeScript, as found on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript). However, I encountered an issue when using the `peerDependencies` field in the `package.json` file. Specifically, running the following command:

```bash
dtslint types "my-plugin"
```

Results in the following error:

```
Error: .../my-plugin/package.json should not include field peerDependencies
```

Some library type definitions may depend on a specific version of a host package, which can lead to issues if that host package is imported more than once. This can occur, for example, when the application requires a different version of the host package than what the library's type definitions expect. This can result in duplicate or conflicting definitions.

Using the `peerDependencies` field is a common solution to this problem, as it ensures that only a single, specific version of the host package is installed, thereby avoiding conflicts. However, in this case, it appears that the use of `peerDependencies` is not allowed.
