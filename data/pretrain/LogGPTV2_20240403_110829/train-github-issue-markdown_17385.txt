  * I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
Currently, using the `"peerDependencies"` field in package.json is forbidden:
    > dtslint types "my-plugin"
    Error: .../my-plugin/package.json should not include field peerDependencies
Some library definitions may depend on a host package version which should not
be imported twice, e.g. due to the host packages exporting duplicate
definitions in this case. This can happen when the application requires a
different version of the host package than the definitions of the library.
Using `"peerDependencies"` solves this problem by only allowing a single
specific version of the host package to be installed.
