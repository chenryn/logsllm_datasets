Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-target-the-parent-
of-an-element-using-jquery has an issue. Please describe how to reproduce it,
and include links to screenshots if possible.
I solved the whole thing and the error is still there saying "Your left-well
element should have a red background." when it is red already and the code is
correct too, please check it!!
