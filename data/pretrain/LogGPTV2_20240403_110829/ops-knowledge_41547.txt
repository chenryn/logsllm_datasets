User: When using Docker to deploy applications, how to implement communication between containers?
Assistant: In Docker, the communication between containers can use the following methods: 1. Use the network functions provided by Docker, such as bridge network, host network, overlay network, etc., to establish network communication between different containers. 2. You can use Docker's link to communicate between containers. By naming the running container, one container can access the port or service exposed by another container by name. 3. The IP address of the container can be used for communication. When Docker runs the container, it will assign a unique IP address to each container, so that the communication between containers can be carried out. 4. You can use third-party container orchestration tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, etc. These tools provide more advanced network and load balancing functions, and can manage communication between containers more conveniently.
