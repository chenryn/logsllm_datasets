well  preliminary  for  launching  next  attacks.  In 
wireless  communication,  everyone  has  in  general 
access  to  the  medium  so  takes  less  effort  to 
launch  as  compared  to  wired  communication. 
Confidentiality  is  a  typical  counter-measurement 
against eavesdropping but if keying material is not 
exchanged in secure manner, eavesdropper could 
compromise 
the  confidentiality.  Secure  key 
exchange  algorithms  such  as  Diffe-Hellman  (DH) 
are used. 
Impersonation:
a  malicious  party  pretends  to  be  a 
legitimate  entity  for  instance  by  replaying  a  generic 
message,

MITM Attack:
Man-in-the-middle attack takes place when 
a malicious entity is on the network path of two genuine 
entities.  Capable  of  delaying,  modifying  or  dropping 
messages.    Interesting  within  the  context  of  PKC, 
malicious  entity  doesn’t  attempt  to  break  the  keys  of 
involved parties but rather to become the falsely trusted

is  achieved  by  exhaustingly  consuming 
resources  at  the  victim  so  that  the  offered  services 
become  unavailable  to  legitimate  entities.  A  common 
way  to  launch  this  attack  is  to  trigger  expensive 
operations at the victim that consume resources such as 
computational  power,  memory  bandwidth  or  energy. 
This  attack  is  critical  for  constrained  devices  where 
existing resources are already scarce.

Internet of Things Security Solutions 
Approaches
Different  approaches  are  being  employed  for 
secure  End-to-End  communication  in  WSNs  and  IoT, 
they can be classified into major research directions as 
follows

Centralized Approaches
Protocol-based Extensions and Optimizations
Alternative Delegation Architectures
Solutions  that  Require  Special  Purpose  Hardware 
Modules
Centralized Approaches
a)
Centralized  security  solution  approaches  are 
considered  as  efficient  and  suitable  for  the  resource-
constrained  sensor  networks  but  the  common  issue  is 
the  scalability  of  the  key  management;  node  must  be 
pre-configured  with  shared  keys  of  all  entities  before 
deployment.  Some  of  the  common  centralized  based 
approaches  are  SPINS  (A  centralized  architecture  for 
securing uni-
and multicast communication in constrain-
ed networks, composed of two security protocols; SNEP 
the  Polynomial-based  scheme 
and  µTESLA)  and

(Polynomial  schemes  aim  at  simplifying 
the  key 
agreement process in distributed sensor networks, main 
idea is to assign every node n a polynomial share F(n; y) 
derived  from  a  secret  symmetric  bi-variate  polynomial 
F(x;  y).  This  allows  any  possible  pair  of  nodes  with  a 
polynomial  share  to  be  able  to  establish  a  common 
secret) [3].
b)
Protocol-based Extensions and Optimizations
Approaches  such  as  compression  aim  at 
optimizing  the  protocol  without  breaking  the  security 
properties.  There  are  several  compression  schemes 
proposed  such  as  the  compression  of  IPV6  header, 
extension headers, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
header  now  standard  in  6LoWPAN.  Some  of  these 
approaches  are  Abbreviated  DTLS  Handshake  (allows 
for a shorter handshake that reuses the state information 
from  the  previous  session,  in  order  to  resume  the 
session).  TLS  Session  Resumption  without  Server-Side 
State where server does not hold any state required  to 
resume  a  session  rather  server's  encrypted  state  is 
offloaded  during  the  handshake  towards  the  client  and 
in caching, TLS Cached Information extension allows for 
omitting  cached 
large 
certificate  chains  from  the  handshake.  Compression  of 
header  information  is  an  approach  to  reduce  the 
transmission  overhead  of  packets 
in  constrained 
environments,  6LoWPAN  defines  already  header 
compression mechanism for IP packets.

Delegation-based Architectures

Delegate  computationally  intensive  tasks,  such 
as  public-key-based  operations  involved  in  session 
establishments, 
to  more  powerful  devices.  Some 
important approaches are: 
[4]. 
Server-based  Certificate  Validation  Protocol 
(SCVP), it enables a client to delegate the complex task 
of certificate validation or certificate path construction to 
a trusted server. SCVP server should be trusted.

powerful  device,  such  as  the  Gateway  (GW).  They 
describe  the  procedure  for  IKE  session  establishment, 
where  the  GW  intercepts  session  establishment  and 
pretends  to  be  the  end-point.  After  calculation  of  the 
session  key,  this  key  is  handed  over  the  constrained 
device  and  both  peers  can  directly  protect 
their 
communication with the session key. But in the vision of 
IoT, not always a trusted GW is present e.g. in the home 
automation  scenario,  constrained  devices  of  different 
manufacturers  might  be  present  in  the  constrained 
network. 
Tiny  3-TLS  [6]:
It  requires  a  strong  trust  level  between 
the  constrained  resource  device  and  the  GW,  offloads 
expensive  public-key-based  operations  to  the  GW.  The 
constrained  resource  device  trusts  the  GW  and  the 
unconstrained device authenticates itself to the GW and 
hence, GW trusts the unconstrained device. 
A Review on Internet of Things (Iot): Security and Privacy Requirements and the Solution Approaches
constrained  resource  device  trusts  the  GW  and  the 
unconstrained device authenticates itself to the GW and 
hence, GW trusts the unconstrained device.  
Consequently,  Tiny  3-TLS  assumes  that  by 
means  of  transitive  trust  the  constrained  device  could 
trust the unconstrained device. Tiny 3-TLS distinguishes 
between partially and fully trusted GWs.  
Sizzle  [7]  implements  a  complete  SSL-secured 
HTTP  web  server  for  constrained  devices  with  support 
for  ECC-based  authentication.  This  approach, 
in 
contrast  to  previous  delegation-based  architectures, 
delegates  only  the  task  of  adapting  the  underlying 
transport-layer protocol. This is achieved by terminating 
the  incoming  TCP  connection  at  the  GW  and  sending 
the  payload  via  a  UDP-based  reliable  protocol  to  the 
constrained  device.  Sizzle  only  allows  for  certificate-
based authentication towards powerful clients and does

devices.

Peer  authentication  and  End-to-End  data 
protection  are  crucial 
to  prevent 
eavesdropping on sensitive data or malicious triggering 
of  harmful  actuating  tasks  in  the  context  of  Internet  of 
Things (IoT). Symmetric key cryptography such as AES 
provides fast and lightweight encryption and decryption 
on  smart  devices  and 
integrated  hardware 
supports  it  as  well.  However,  when  number  of  devices 
connected  becomes  high,  exchanging  symmetric  keys 
becomes  a  challenging  task  and  an  efficient  scalable 
key establishment protocol is required. Asymmetric key 
cryptography is another method for key establishment at 
two ends, but it involves high computational overheads 
which  are  the  main  concerns  for  resource-constrained 
low  resources  (energy, 
devices  [9].  Sensors  with 
computation)  are  not  meant 
to  perform  complex 
asymmetric cryptographic operations. 
Key  establishment  protocols  are  used 
to 
provide  shared  secrets  between  two  or  more  parties, 
typically for subsequent use as private keys for a variety 
of cryptographic objectives [12]. These objectives are in 
turn  used  as  security  primitives  for  enabling  various 
security  protocols  such  as  source  authentication, 
integrity  protection  or  confidentiality  [8].  To  afford 
interoperable  network  security  between  endpoints  from 
independent  network  domains,  variants  of  traditional 
End-to-End  IP  security  protocols  have  recently  been 
proposed  for  resource-constrained  devices  and  the 
networks formed by them [9].  
•  Protocol variants such as Datagram Transport Layer 
Security  (DTLS)  [14],  HIP-DEX  [15],  and  minimal 
IKEv2 [16] consider public-key cryptography in their 
protocol  design.  As  public-key  cryptography 
acquires  significant  computational  processing  and 
transmission  overheads 
in  resource-constrained 
network environments, research and standardization 
currently  focuses  to  reduce  the  public-key  related 
overheads during the protocol handshake.

Other  approaches  proposed  including  session 
resumption  mechanisms  [17]  and  caching  of  static 
handshake 
[18]. 
However, the considerable RAM and ROM requirements 
make the use of public-key cryptography unsuitable for 
a  wide  range  of  constrained  devices  [9].  One  such 
implementation  of  two-way  authentication  scheme  for 
the  IoT  based  on  DTLS  protocol  is  described  in  [19]. 
This  approach  even  generates  considerable  overheads 
to  the  network  traffic  due  to  the  utilization  of  X.509 
certificates and RSA public keys with DTLS handshake. 
Both  these  X.509  certificate  and  RSA  public  key  with 
DTLS handshake involve heavy computations for the low 
performing  and  high 
resource-constrained  sensor 
nodes.
d)
A class of security solutions relies on additional 
hardware  security  modules,  such  as  TPMs.  A  Trusted 
Platform  Module  (TPM)  is  tamper-proof  hardware  that 
provides  support 
for  cryptographic  computations 
especially  public-key-based  cryptographic  primitives. 
TPMs  can  hold  keys,  such  as  RSA  private  keys,  in  a 
protected memory area. Furthermore, the cryptographic
