# A Review on Internet of Things (IoT): Security and Privacy Requirements and Solution Approaches

## Abstract
This review examines the security and privacy requirements in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) and explores various solution approaches. It discusses common attacks, such as eavesdropping, impersonation, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and presents different security solutions, including centralized approaches, protocol-based extensions, delegation architectures, and hardware-based approaches.

## 1. Introduction
The proliferation of IoT devices has raised significant concerns about security and privacy. This paper reviews the key security challenges and the existing solutions to mitigate these risks.

## 2. Common Attacks in IoT
### 2.1 Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping involves overhearing an ongoing communication, which can be a preliminary step for launching further attacks. In wireless communication, where everyone has access to the medium, it is easier to launch eavesdropping attacks compared to wired communication. Confidentiality is a typical countermeasure against eavesdropping. However, if keying material is not exchanged securely, an eavesdropper can compromise confidentiality. Secure key exchange algorithms, such as the Diffie-Hellman (DH) algorithm, are commonly used to address this issue.

### 2.2 Impersonation
Impersonation occurs when a malicious party pretends to be a legitimate entity, often by replaying a generic message. This attack can undermine the security goals of authentication and integrity.

### 2.3 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack
A MITM attack takes place when a malicious entity intercepts the network path between two genuine entities. The attacker can delay, modify, or drop messages. In the context of public-key cryptography (PKC), the malicious entity does not attempt to break the keys but rather becomes a falsely trusted intermediary.

### 2.4 Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack
A DoS attack targets the availability of a system by exhausting its resources, making the offered services unavailable to legitimate users. Common methods include triggering expensive operations that consume computational power, memory bandwidth, or energy. This type of attack is particularly critical for resource-constrained devices, where available resources are already limited.

## 3. IoT Security Solutions
Various approaches are being employed to ensure secure end-to-end communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and IoT. These can be classified into the following research directions:

### 3.1 Centralized Approaches
Centralized security solutions are efficient for resource-constrained sensor networks but face scalability issues in key management. Nodes must be pre-configured with shared keys before deployment. Common centralized approaches include:
- **SPINS**: A centralized architecture for securing unicast and multicast communication in constrained networks, composed of two security protocols: SNEP and µTESLA.
- **Polynomial-based schemes**: These aim to simplify the key agreement process in distributed sensor networks by assigning each node a polynomial share derived from a secret symmetric bivariate polynomial. This allows any pair of nodes with a polynomial share to establish a common secret.

### 3.2 Protocol-based Extensions and Optimizations
These approaches aim to optimize the protocol without compromising security properties. Examples include:
- **Compression schemes**: Such as the compression of IPv6 headers, extension headers, and UDP headers, now standard in 6LoWPAN.
- **Abbreviated DTLS Handshake**: Allows for a shorter handshake that reuses state information from the previous session to resume the session.
- **TLS Session Resumption without Server-Side State**: The server does not hold any state required to resume a session; instead, the server's encrypted state is offloaded to the client during the handshake.
- **TLS Cached Information Extension**: Omits large certificate chains from the handshake, reducing transmission overhead in constrained environments.

### 3.3 Delegation-based Architectures
These architectures delegate computationally intensive tasks, such as public-key-based operations, to more powerful devices. Important approaches include:
- **Server-based Certificate Validation Protocol (SCVP)**: Enables a client to delegate the complex task of certificate validation or certificate path construction to a trusted server.
- **IKE Session Establishment**: A procedure where a gateway (GW) intercepts session establishment, performs public-key-based operations, and hands over the session key to the constrained device.
- **Tiny 3-TLS**: Offloads expensive public-key-based operations to the GW, assuming transitive trust between the constrained device and the unconstrained device.
- **Sizzle**: Implements a complete SSL-secured HTTP web server for constrained devices, supporting ECC-based authentication. It delegates the task of adapting the underlying transport-layer protocol by terminating the incoming TCP connection at the GW and sending the payload via a UDP-based reliable protocol to the constrained device.

### 3.4 Hardware-based Approaches
Some security solutions rely on additional hardware security modules, such as Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs). TPMs are tamper-proof hardware that provides support for cryptographic computations, especially public-key-based primitives. They can hold keys, such as RSA private keys, in a protected memory area, and their cryptographic accelerators can handle heavy computations.

## 4. Conclusion
Ensuring the security and privacy of IoT devices is crucial. Various approaches, including centralized, protocol-based, delegation, and hardware-based solutions, are being developed to address these challenges. Future research should focus on improving the efficiency and scalability of these solutions to meet the growing demands of the IoT ecosystem.
