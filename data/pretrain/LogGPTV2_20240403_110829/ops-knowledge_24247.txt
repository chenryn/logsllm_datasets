Assistant: Database migration refers to migrating an existing database or data storage system (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc.) to another database or data storage system. A database migration usually requires the following steps: 1. Requirements analysis: clarify the purpose of the migration, and determine the scope and requirements of the migration. 2. Determine the target database: Determine the target database for migration based on demand analysis, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc. 3. Data preprocessing: necessary cleaning, filtering, conversion and processing of raw data to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data. 4. Data backup: Back up the original data to prevent data loss or damage. 5. Data migration: Import the backed up data into the target database, you can use SQL import tool or data migration tool to migrate. 6. Data verification: verify and test the migrated data to ensure the consistency and correctness of the data. 7. Application migration: If the application is connected to the original database, it needs to be modified to connect to the new target database. 8. Check the running status: troubleshoot and deal with problems and errors that occurred during the migration process to ensure that the application can run normally after migration. Technical requirements: 1. Familiar with using various database tools, SQL import tools, data migration tools, etc. 2. Have a certain understanding of the target database, such as database structure, storage engine, performance characteristics, etc. 3. Have certain data preprocessing skills. 4. Strong database design and data model design capabilities. 5. Strong data analysis and data mining capabilities. 6. Strong troubleshooting and problem solving skills.
