If a directory named `upgrade_backup` exists within your Neo4j database directory, it may cause the startup process to fail. Below is an example of such a scenario, along with the error messages and warnings you might encounter:

```bash
axel@dev1 ~/Downloads/neo4j-community-2.1.2$ bin/neo4j start
WARNING: The maximum number of open files allowed is 1024. A minimum of 40,000 is recommended. Please refer to the Neo4j manual for more information.
Using additional JVM arguments: -server -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -Dorg.neo4j.server.properties=conf/neo4j-server.properties -Djava.util.logging.config.file=conf/logging.properties -Dlog4j.configuration=file:conf/log4j.properties -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled
Starting Neo4j Server... WARNING: Not changing user.
Process [4736]... waiting for server to be ready..... Failed to start within 120 seconds.
Neo4j Server may have failed to start. Please check the logs for further details.
```

### Explanation:
- **File Descriptor Limit Warning**: The system warns that the limit on the number of open files (file descriptors) is set to 1024, which is below the recommended minimum of 40,000. This can impact performance and stability.
- **JVM Arguments**: The server starts with specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM) arguments to optimize performance and logging.
- **User Change Warning**: The server does not change the user, which is a security best practice. Ensure that the server is running with the appropriate user permissions.
- **Startup Failure**: The server fails to start within 120 seconds, indicating a potential issue. You should check the logs for more detailed error messages to diagnose the problem.

To resolve the issue, you may need to:
1. Remove or rename the `upgrade_backup` directory.
2. Increase the file descriptor limit as recommended.
3. Review the logs for any additional errors or warnings.
