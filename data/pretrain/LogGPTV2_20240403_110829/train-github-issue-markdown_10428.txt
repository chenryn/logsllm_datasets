**Current behavior**
If you navigate to a route with multiple search parameters with the same key,
they will be merged to one with only the last appearing parameters value. i.e.  
`host.com/test?p=test&p=best `  
would result in  
`host.com/test?p=best`  
once Angular has loaded.
**Expected behavior**
Navigating to  
`host.com/test?p=test&p=best`  
should result in  
`host.com/test?p=test&p=best`  
once Angular has loaded.
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
Steps to reproduce: Implement routing, navigate to a route with more than one
search parameter with the same key.  
Here's a plnkr of the issue. Open it full screen and click on the thing that
says click me.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**
The rest point I'm using for filtering/facetting adds multiple search
parameter keys of the same type if I select more than one filter/facet. With
the current behaviour I can only select one filter per type as it will merge
everything with the same key together. Feels unnecessary to merge?
