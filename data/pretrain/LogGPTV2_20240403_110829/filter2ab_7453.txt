**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Multi-Factor Authentication

To enhance security, implement the following multi-factor authentication (MFA) measures in your Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) environment:

1. **Device Registration:**
   - Require multi-factor authentication for device registration in Azure AD. This ensures that only authorized users can register devices with their accounts.

2. **Inactive Accounts:**
   - Configure MFA systems to prevent the enrollment of new devices for inactive accounts. This helps to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access from dormant or compromised accounts.

3. **Initial Enrollment:**
   - When first enrolling a user in MFA, use conditional access policies to restrict device enrollment to trusted locations or devices. This adds an additional layer of security by limiting the contexts in which MFA can be set up.
   - Consider using temporary access passes as an initial MFA solution for device enrollment. Temporary access passes provide a one-time, time-limited method for users to enroll their devices, reducing the risk of persistent credentials being intercepted.

By implementing these MFA best practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your Azure AD environment and protect against unauthorized access.
