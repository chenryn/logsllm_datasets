User: I was learning python use sublime text2 dev.
when I code "hello world" and build it, the "cmd"window appears and disappears in a moment.
I want to make the output hold on,but I don't know how.
help me, thank you.
Assistant: Just add raw_input("Press ENTER to exit") and it will "pause" until you press a key. You should be able to add this line anywhere and as often as needed.
