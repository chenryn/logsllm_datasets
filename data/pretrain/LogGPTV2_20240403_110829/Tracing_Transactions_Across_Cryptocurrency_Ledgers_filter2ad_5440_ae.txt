transactions in a small time period, on the theory that it would
be associated primarily with trading bots.
We started by searching for sets of consecutive ShapeShift
transactions that carried approximately the same value in
curIn (with an error rate of 1%) and involved the same curren-
cies. When we did this, however, we found thousands of such
sets. We thus added the extra conditions that there must be at
least 15 transactions in the set that took place in a span of ﬁve
minutes; i.e., that within a ﬁve-minute block of ShapeShift
transactions there were at least 15 involving the same cur-
rencies and carrying the same approximate USD value. This
resulted in 107 such sets.
After obtaining our 107 trading clusters, we removed trans-
actions that we believed were false positives in that they hap-
pened to have a similar value but were clearly the odd one out.
For example, in a cluster of 20 transactions with 19 ETH-BTC
transactions and one LTC-ZEC transaction, we removed the
latter. We were thus left with clusters of either a particular
pair (e.g., ETH-BTC) or two pairs where the curOut or the
curIn was the same (e.g., ETH-BTC and ZEC-BTC), which
suggests either the purchase of a rising coin or the dump of
a declining one. We sought to further validate these clusters
by using our heuristic from Section 7.2 to see if the clusters
shared common addresses. While we typically did not ﬁnd
this in UTXO-based currencies (as most entities operate using
many addresses), in account-based currencies we found that
in almost every case there was one particular address that was
involved in the trading cluster.
We summarize our results in Figure 6, in terms of the most
common pairs of currencies and the total money exchanged by
trading clusters using those currencies. It is clear that the most
common interactions are performed between the most popular
currencies overall, with the exception of Monero (XMR) and
SALT. In particular, we found six clusters consisting of 17-20
transactions that exchanged BTC for XMR, and 13 clusters
that exchanged BTC for SALT, an Ethereum-based token. The
sizes of each trading cluster varied between 16 and 33 trans-
actions and in total comprise 258 transactions, each of which
shifted exactly 0.1 BTC. In total they originated from 514 dif-
ferent Bitcoin addresses, which may make it appear as though
different people carried out these transactions. After applying
our pass-through heuristic, however, we found that across all
the transactions there were only two distinct SALT addresses
used to receive the output. It is thus instead likely that this
represents trading activity involving one or two entities.

8.4 Usage of anonymity tools
Given the potential usage of ShapeShift for money laundering
or other criminal activities, we sought to understand the extent
to which its users seemed motivated to hide the source of their
funds. While using ShapeShift is already one attempt at doing
this, we focus here on the combination of using ShapeShift
and so-called “privacy coins” (Dash, Monero, and Zcash) that
are designed to offer improved anonymity guarantees.
In terms of the effect of the introduction of KYC into
ShapeShift, the number of transactions using Zcash as curIn
averaged 164 per day the month before, and averaged 116 per
day the month after. We also saw a small decline with Zcash
as curOut: 69 per day before and 43 per day after. Monero
and Dash, however, saw much higher declines, and in fact
saw the largest declines across all eight cryptocurrencies. The
daily average the month before was 136 using Monero as
curIn, whereas it was 47 after. Similarly, the daily average
using it as curOut was 316 before and 62 after. For Dash, the
daily average as curIn was 128 before and 81 after, and the
daily average as curOut was 103 before and 42 after.
In terms of the blockchain data we had (according to the
most popular currencies), our analysis in what follows is re-
stricted to Dash and Zcash, although we leave an exploration
of Monero as interesting future work.
8.4.1 Zcash
The main anonymity feature in Zcash is known as the shielded
pool. Brieﬂy, transparent Zcash transactions behave just like
Bitcoin transactions in that they reveal in the clear the sender
and recipient (according to so-called t-addresses), as well as
the value being sent. This information is hidden to various de-
grees, however, when interacting with the pool. In particular,
when putting money into the pool the recipient is speciﬁed
using a so-called z-address, which hides the recipient but still

ShapeShift and the shielded pool in Zcash.
reveals the sender, and taking money out of the pool hides
the sender (through the use of zero-knowledge proofs [2]) but
reveals the recipient. Finally, Zcash is designed to provide
privacy mainly in the case in which users transact within the
shielded pool, which hides the sender, recipient, and the value
being sent.
We considered three possible interactions between
ShapeShift and the shielded pool, as depicted in Figure 7: (1)
a user shifts coins directly from ShapeShift into the shielded
pool, (2) a user shifts to a t-address but then uses that t-address
to put money into the pool, and (3) a user sends money directly
from the pool to ShapeShift.
For the ﬁrst type of interaction, we found 29,003 transac-
tions that used ZEC as curOut. Of these, 758 had a z-address
as the output address, meaning coins were sent directly to
the shielded pool. The total value put into the pool in these
transactions was 6,707.86 ZEC, which is 4.3% of all the ZEC
received in pass-through transactions. When attempting to use
z-addresses in our own interactions with ShapeShift, however,
we consistently encountered errors or were told to contact
customer service. It is thus not clear if usage of this feature is
supported at the time of writing.
For the second type of interaction, there were 1309 where
the next transaction (i.e., the transaction in which this UTXO
spent its contents) involved putting money into the pool.
The total value put into the pool in these transactions was
12,534 ZEC, which is 8.2% of all the ZEC received in pass-
through transactions.
For the third type of interaction, we found 111,041 pass-
through transactions that used ZEC as curIn. Of these, 3808
came directly from the pool, with a total value of 22,490 ZEC
(14% of all the ZEC sent in pass-through transactions).
Thus, while the usage of the anonymity features in Zcash
was not necessarily a large fraction of the overall usage of
Zcash in ShapeShift, there is clear potential to move large
amounts of Zcash (representing over 10 million USD at the
time it was transacted) by combining ShapeShift with the
shielded pool.
8.4.2 Dash
As in Zcash, the “standard” transaction in Dash is similar to
a Bitcoin transaction in terms of the information it reveals.
Its main anonymity feature — PrivateSend transactions — are
a type of CoinJoin [8]. A CoinJoin is speciﬁcally designed
to invalidate the multi-input clustering heuristic described in
Section 7, as it allows multiple users to come together and
send coins to different sets of recipients in a single transac-
tion. If each sender sends the same number of coins to their
recipient, then it is difﬁcult to determine which input address
corresponds to which output address, thus severing the link
between an individual sender and recipient.
In a traditional CoinJoin, users must ﬁnd each other in
some ofﬂine manner (e.g., an IRC channel) and form the
transaction together over several rounds of communication.
This can be a cumbersome process, so Dash aims to sim-
plify it for users by automatically ﬁnding other users for them
and chaining multiple mixes together. In order to ensure that
users cannot accidentally de-anonymize themselves by send-
ing uniquely identiﬁable values, these PrivateSend transac-
tions are restricted to speciﬁc denominations: 0.01, 0.1, 1,
and 10 DASH. As observed by Kalodner et al. [5], however,
the CoinJoin denominations often contain a fee of 0.0000001
DASH, which must be factored in when searching for these
transactions. Our parameters for identifying a CoinJoin were
thus that (1) the transaction must have at least three inputs,
(2) the outputs must consist solely of values from the list of
possible denominations (modulo the fees), and (3) and all out-
put values must be the same. In fact, given how Dash operates
there is always one output with a non-standard value, so it was
further necessary to relax the second and third requirements
to allow there to be at most one address that does not carry
the speciﬁed value.
We ﬁrst looked to see how often the DASH sent to
ShapeShift had originated from a CoinJoin, which meant
identifying if the inputs of a Phase 1 transaction were out-
puts from a CoinJoin. Out of 100,410 candidate transac-
tions, we found 2,068 that came from a CoinJoin, carrying
a total of 11,929 DASH in value (6.5% of the total value
across transactions with Dash as curIn). Next, we looked at
whether or not users performed a CoinJoin after receiving
coins from ShapeShift, which meant identifying if the outputs
of a Phase 2 transaction had been spent in a CoinJoin. Out
of 50,545 candidate transactions, we found only 33 CoinJoin
transactions, carrying a total of 187 DASH in value (0.1% of
the total value across transactions using Dash as curOut).
If we revisit our results concerning the use of U-turns in
Dash from Section 6.2, we recall that there was a large asym-
metry in terms of the results of our two heuristics: only 5.6%
of the U-turns used the same UTXO, but 64.6% of U-turns
used the same address. This suggests that some additional
on-chain transaction took place between the two ShapeShift
transactions, and indeed upon further inspection we identiﬁed
many cases where this transaction was a CoinJoin. There thus
appears to have been a genuine attempt to take advantage
of the privacy that Dash offers, but this was completely inef-
fective due to the use of the same address that both sent and
received the mixed coins.

In this study, we presented a characterization of the usage of
the ShapeShift trading platform over a thirteen-month period,
focusing on the ability to link together the ledgers of multiple
different cryptocurrencies. To accomplish this task, we looked
at these trading platforms from several different perspectives,
ranging from the correlations between the transactions they
produce in the cryptocurrency ledgers to the relationships
they reveal between seemingly distinct users. The techniques
we develop demonstrate that it is possible to capture com-
plex transactional behaviors and trace their activity even as it
moves across ledgers, which has implications for any crimi-
nals attempting to use these platforms to obscure their ﬂow
of money.
