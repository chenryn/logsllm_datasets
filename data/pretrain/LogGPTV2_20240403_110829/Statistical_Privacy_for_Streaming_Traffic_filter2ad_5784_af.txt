APPENDIX
Theorem 1. Suppose for database D, we have method A that
is -private, and method B that is (d∗, )-private. We denote
the maximum and minimum d∗ distance in D as dmax and
dmin. Then we have:
(1) If B is (d∗, )-private, then B is (dmax)-private.
(2) If A is -private, then A is (d∗,
)-private.

dmin
PROOF. According to the deﬁnitions, we have:
A : P(A(x) ∈ Z) ≤ exp(A) × P(A(x(cid:48)) ∈ Z)
(6)
B : P(A(x) ∈ Z) ≤ exp(B ×d∗(x, x(cid:48)))×P(A(x(cid:48)) ∈ Z) (7)
For B, we have:
B × dmin ≤ B × d∗(x, x(cid:48)) ≤ B × dmax
(8)
If B is (d∗, )-private,
P(A(x) ∈ Z)
P(A(x(cid:48)) ∈ Z)
= exp( × d∗(x, x(cid:48))) ≤ exp( × dmax)
(9)
So B is at least (dmax)-private. Similarly, if A is -private,
let  = (cid:48) × d∗(x, x(cid:48)), we have:
(cid:48) =

d∗(x, x(cid:48))
≤ 
dmin
(10)
So A is at least (d∗,

dmin
)-private.
