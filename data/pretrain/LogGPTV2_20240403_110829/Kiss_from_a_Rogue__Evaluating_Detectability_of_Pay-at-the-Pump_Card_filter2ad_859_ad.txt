### Figure 7: Municipal Seal Usage
This style of seal is used throughout the municipality. To ensure the correct seal is being used, consumers must be aware of the type of seal expected to be present.

### Figure 8: Security Seal on a Gas Pump
The image shows a security seal on a gas pump that instructs consumers to immediately notify an attendant if the words "VOID OPEN" appear. The presence of these words indicates tampering.

### B. Real-World Skimmer Data
To measure the impact of security measures, we conducted a long-term study of skimmer incidents in Florida. The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (DACS) is responsible for inspecting gas pumps, including pay-at-the-pump terminals. DACS has the legal authority to open pumps for inspection and regularly inspects each pump in Florida. They also collect reports from other law enforcement agencies when skimmers are identified.

#### Data Collection
We obtained records of all reported gas pump skimmers between March 10, 2015, and November 14, 2018, from the Florida DACS. These reports provide insights into the locations and types of skimmers found, as well as the security measures in place at the time of detection. The dataset includes 1,588 reports covering 2,072 skimmers across 953 unique locations. All identified skimmers were internal.

### Figure 9: Map of Found Skimmers in Florida
A map showing the locations of all found skimmers in Florida from early 2015 to late 2018.

### Analysis of Data
Using the raw data from the Florida DACS, we resolved the addresses to latitude and longitude using the Geocodio API. We successfully geocoded 97% of the reports, with the remaining 3% failing due to coarse location or improper addressing. Using Cartopy and Matplotlib, we plotted the incidence of skimmers by location, as shown in Figure 9. Skimmer density correlates with major population centers like southeast Florida, but well-traveled interstates and state roads also attract skimmers regardless of the surrounding area.

### Figure 10: Distance to Nearest Interstate Exit
A cumulative distribution showing the great circle distance in miles of all found skimmers in Florida to the nearest interstate exit. Nearly 50% of all skimmers were found within one mile of an interstate exit, 80% within three miles, and 90% within five miles. This suggests that driving more than five miles from an interstate would substantially reduce the risk, though it may not be convenient for most consumers.

### Security Measures and Their Effectiveness
#### Seal and Tape Conditions
The most common themes in the reports were related to tamper-evident seals. The top two themes were "tape correctly placed" (929 comments) and "tape incorrectly placed" (79 comments). Other themes included "tape broken" (33 comments), "tape not present" (30 comments), "tape intact" (17 comments), "tape present" (17 comments), "tape was incorrect/fake" (13 comments), and "tape not working" (3 comments). The high frequency of seal-related themes highlights the reliance on seals for securing pumps.

Most comments mentioned correctly placed seals. However, in some cases, the tape was intact and correctly placed even after skimmer installation, suggesting that seals' presence and placement are being attacked. Possible reasons include:
- The seal not functioning correctly.
- The seal being replaced by the adversary.
- An employee not checking for or noticing the skimmer.
- The skimmer being installed from the rear of the unit, where the pump is not internally sealed.

#### Discovery of Fake or Incorrect Seals
The discovery of fake or incorrect seals confirms attacks on seal identity. Consumers or employees need to know how the expected seal should look and, if available, the correct serial number to verify its authenticity.

### Security Measures in Place
Two fields in each report reference security measures: "Security Measures in Place?" and "Comment." We were informed that the former notes whether any approved security measure was in use. Out of 1,588 reports, 300 (18.9%) answers to "Security Measures in Place?" were blank, and 42 (2.6%) contained an answer other than "Yes" or "No." Of the remaining records, 1,127 (90.4%) indicated measures were in place, and 119 (9.6%) indicated they were not.

### Comments Analysis
The Comments field is a free-form field, and we analyzed 1,190 reports that included information in this field. Two researchers coded the data, generating a set of codes representing the security measures, their condition, and how they were discovered. The average Cohen’s kappa over the 30 codes was κ=0.94 (min=0.73, SD=0.09), indicating almost perfect agreement.

### Conclusion
The data overwhelmingly shows that existing security measures are ineffective at deterring skimmers. The presence and condition of other security measures, such as high security locks, alarms, and screws, were also noted. High security locks were the most commonly mentioned non-seal security measure, but their effectiveness remains questionable. Future work could focus on developing predictive models for skimming attacks based on comprehensive data about gas station locations.
