In order to identify whether the correct seal is being used,
consumers must be aware of the type of seal expected to be
present.

payments secure onto consumers.
B. Real-World Skimmer Data
We now measure the impact of these security measures
by conducting a long-term study of skimmer incidents. In
Florida, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
is responsible for the inspection of gas pumps,
including
the pay-at-the-pump payment terminals. This organization is
legally capable of opening pumps for inspection and regularly
inspects each of the pumps in Florida. They also collect reports
from other law enforcement agencies when those agencies
are informed of the presence of a skimmer (e.g., when an
employee of a gas station identiﬁes a skimmer).
We obtained records of all reported gas pump skimmers
between 10 March 2015 and 14 November 2018 from the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
The data in these reports provides insight into the locations
and types of skimmers found and information about which

security measures were deployed on the pump at the time
of detection. The reporting timeframe contains 1,588 reports
covering 2,072 skimmers that were found across 953 unique
locations. All of the skimmers found were internal skimmers.
Below, we analyze this data and discuss the effectiveness of
security mechanisms in place at the time of discovery.
1) Locations and Frequency: Using the raw data from the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
we resolved the contained addresses to latitude and longitude
using the online geographical API, Geocodio.3 We were able to
successfully resolve 97% of the reports to global coordinates,
with the remaining 3% failing to geocode due to coarse loca-
tion or improper addressing. With the successfully translated
addresses, we plotted the incidence of skimmers by location
in Figure 9 using Cartopy and Matplotlib. Skimmer density
correlates well to major population centers such as southeast
Florida, but well-traveled interstates and state roads also appear
to attract skimmers regardless of the surrounding area.
Anecdotal advice to avoid being skimmed may include a
suggestion to avoid gas stations right off of an interstate, but
evidence substantiating this intuition is difﬁcult to come by.
To examine this claim, we plotted the skimmers’ distances to
the nearest interstate exit in Figure 10. The data showed that
nearly 50% of all skimmers were found within one mile of an
interstate exit (state roads and highways not included). Further,
80% of all skimmers found were within three miles, and 90%
within ﬁve. While this supports a claim that skimmers are less
likely as distance from an interstate increases, we note there
are conﬂating factors: First, some high-population areas are
not immediately adjacent to an interstate. Second, increased
density of skimmer activity near interstates may be related
to higher density of gas stations near interstates. In general,
this data suggests that driving more than ﬁve miles from an
interstate would substantially reduce risk, but is unlikely to be
convenient or viable for most consumers. It may be possible
to obtain comprehensive data about gas station locations (our
data includes only locations where skimmers have been found)

(additional) security lock or an extra security (high security)
lock. In cases of disagreement, those codes were discarded for
our quantitative results.
We were speciﬁcally interested in extracting data about the
state of the pump’s security at the time of the report, who
discovered the skimmer, and what data retrieval capabilities
the skimmer had. We used generic code “no annotation” if
the comment was blank, only mentioned a case number, only
mentioned who it was given to, or was solely about some
change made after inspection/removal or change in progress.
Likewise, we used generic code “unclear” if we did not
understand the meaning of the comment in the context of the
pump’s security. We used code “tape present” if a comment
mentioned that tape was present but nothing more about its
state. Table IV provides the codebook with frequency counts
where both reviewers agreed.
Seal/Tape Conditions. The most common themes among all
reports were related to tamper-evident seals. The top two
themes among all reports were “tape correctly placed” (929
comments) and “tape incorrectly placed” (79 comments). Other
themes for seal and tape conditions were “tape broken” (33
comments), “tape not present” (30 comments), “tape intact”
(17 comments), “tape present” (17 comments), “tape was
incorrect/fake” (13 comments), and “tape not working” (3
comments). The rate of appearance of seal-related themes
highlights the reliance on seals for securing pumps.
The majority of comments mentioned correctly placed
seals. One reported skimmer was even found to only have a
seal on the pump where the skimmer was located (“This pump
had tape intact/all other pumps missing tape/compromised”
(821)). While most reports did not note whether the seal was
broken, intact, or fake, the provider of the data conﬁrmed that
in the majority of cases, the tape is intact and correctly placed.
Our analysis could not extrapolate this from the comments,
but presence of correctly-placed, intact seals after skimmer
installation suggests that seals’ presence and placement are
being attacked.
it removes without
There are multiple reasons why an intact, correctly placed
seal may be present after skimmer installation: the seal may
not function correctly (i.e.,
indicating
tampering), the seal may have been replaced by the adversary
(see below), by an employee that did not check for or notice
the skimmer, or the skimmer may have been installed from
the rear of the unit. Gas pumps are not sealed internally and
depending on the model, it is possible to access one side of
the terminal through the pump from the other side. In such
a scenario, a seal might be broken on the opposite side from
where the skimmer is installed (“Pressure Sensitive Security
Seal Broken in pump 11. Probably the skimmer in pump 12
was installed through pump 11.” (842)). In any of these cases,
the seal would not indicate tampering, even if it had occurred.
This causes a disconnect between the problem of whether a
skimmer is present and whether the seal indicates tampering.
The discovery of fake or incorrect seals also conﬁrms at-
tacks on seal identity. These seals (including branded seals) are
available on the Internet, and evaluating whether the identity
of the seal is correct requires the consumer or employee to
know how the expected seal should look and (if available)
the correct serial number. A consumer would likely need to

and develop predictive models for skimming attacks, but we
leave such a study to future work.
2) Security Measures: Two ﬁelds in each report speciﬁ-
cally reference security measures used at a pump or station:
“Security Measures in Place?” and “Comment.” We were
informed that the former notes whether or not the location
where the skimmer was found was using any approved security
measure [1]. 300 (18.9%) answers to “Security Measures in
Place?” were blank and 42 records (2.6%) contain an answer
other than “Yes” or “No” (this text was analyzed alongside
the comments below). 1,127 (90.4%) of the remaining records
indicate measures were in place and 119 (9.6%) indicate they
were not.
To reiterate: the data in these reports describe events in
which one or more skimmers were found to be present, and
this data overwhelmingly shows existing security measures are
ineffective at deterring skimmers.
Comments Analysis. The Comments ﬁeld is a free-form
ﬁeld, so we consider the comments to be equivalent to a
free response question asking for any additional information.
To identify major themes [12], two researchers coded 1,190
reports that included information in this ﬁeld. Such an analysis
aids in understanding the state of the security measures of
the pump at the time a skimmer was detected, as written
by the reporter. One researcher open-coded the entire set
and generated a set of codes or themes representing which
security measures were speciﬁcally mentioned in the reports,
their condition, and how they were discovered. The second
researcher then coded the entire set using the codebook. We
met to discuss if any errors were found in the codebook, and
no emergent themes or errors were discovered. We calculated
inter-rater reliability on the coded data using Cohen’s kappa.
Since a comment could have multiple codes assigned to it,
we ﬁrst converted each code into a binary yes/no variable
to compute agreement on presence or absence of the code.
The average Cohen’s kappa over the 30 codes was κ=0.94
(min=0.73, SD=0.09), which corresponds to “almost perfect”
agreement [32]. Most remaining disagreements were related
to different interpretations of ambiguous grammar. For exam-
ple, the two researchers disagreed on whether “Pumps have
properly placed security tape/pump had fake seal and bent
extra security lock” (524) meant that the pump had an extra
