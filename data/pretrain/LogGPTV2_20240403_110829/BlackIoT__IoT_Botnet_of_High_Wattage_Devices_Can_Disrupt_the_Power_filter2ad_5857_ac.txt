component of the grid (the 𝑁 − 1 standard). Therefore,
the daily operation of the grid is planned such that even a
failure in the largest generator does not aﬀect its normal
operation.
The scenarios predicted by the 𝑁 − 1 standard, how-
ever, are quite diﬀerent from the scenarios caused by the
MadIoT attacks. Although an increase in the demand can
be similar to losing a generator from the supply and de-
mand balance perspective, these two phenomena result
in completely diﬀerent power ﬂows in the grid. Hence,
although losing a generator may not result in any is-
sues as planned, increase in the demands by an adver-
sary may result in many line overloads. Moreover, the
imbalance caused by an adversary may surpass the im-
balance caused due to losing the largest generator, and
therefore results in unpredicted frequency disturbances.
For example, the capacity of the largest operating gener-
ator in the system may be 1𝐺𝑊 (usually a nuclear power
plant) which can be surpassed by an attack comprising
more than 100 thousand compromised water heaters.
Despite these diﬃculties, we provide sketches of coun-
termeasures against the MadIoT attacks in Section 5.
3.4 Connection to Historical Blackouts
There have been several large-scale blackouts in the
past two decades around the world. Although these
events were not caused by any attacks, the chain of events
that led to these blackouts could have been initiated by a
MadIoT attack. For example, the initial reactive power
deﬁcit in Ohio in 2003 leading to the large-scale blackout
in the U.S. and Canada [60], and the failures in the tie-
lines connecting Italy to Switzerland in 2003 leading to
the complete shutdown of the Italian grid [59], could have
been caused by MadIoT attacks. Most of these events
happened beacuse the systems’ operators were not pre-
pared for the unexpected initial event. Hence, the Ma-
dIoT attacks could result in similar unexpected failures.
We reviewed a few of the recent blackouts in the power
grids around the world and demonstrated how an adver-
sary could have caused similar blackouts. The details of
these events are relegated to Appendix A.
4 Experimental Demonstrations
In this section, we demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of
the MadIoT attacks on real-world power grid models via
state-of-the-art simulators. Recall that the MadIoT at-
tacks are black-box. Therefore, the outcome of an at-
tack highly depends on the operational properties of the
targeted system at the time of the attack (e.g., genera-
tors’ settings, amount of renewable resources, and power
ﬂows). We emphasize this in our simulations by chang-
ing the power grid models’ parameters to reﬂect the daily
changes in the operational properties of the system.
4.1 Simulations Setup
Our results are based on computer simulations. In par-
ticular, we use the MATPOWER [65] and the Power-
World [7] simulators. MATPOWER is an open-source
MATLAB library which is widely used for computing the
power ﬂows in power grids. PowerWorld, on the other
hand, is an industrial-level software suite that is widely
used by the industry for frequency stability analysis of
power systems. We used the academic version of Power-

Figure 6: The WSCC 9-bus system. The generators at buses 2
and 3 are the buses with inertia, and the generator at bus 1 is a
slack bus with no inertia. The slack bus is a bus in the system
that can change its generation to make the power ﬂow equations
feasible. The load buses are buses 5, 6, and 8. We consider two
operational settings of the WSCC system: (a) high inertia, in
which both generators 2 and 3 have inertia constants (𝐻) equal
to 15𝑠, and (b) low inertia, in which generators 2 and 3 have in-
ertia constants equal to 5𝑠 and 10𝑠, respectively [51, Chapter 3].
In all the simulations, the IEEE type-2 speed-governing model
(IEEE-G2) is used for the generators [44].
World.
For frequency stability analysis in PowerWorld, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no large-scale real-world
power grids available for academic research. Hence, for
evaluating the eﬀects of the MadIoT attacks on the sys-
tem’s frequency, we use the WSCC 9-bus grid model that
represents a simple approximation of the Western System
Coordinating Council (WSCC)–with 9 buses, 9 lines, and
315𝑀𝑊 of demand [35]. Despite its small size, due to
the complexity of power systems transient analysis, it is
widely used as a benchmark system [22, 48, 52].
For evaluating the eﬀects of MadIoT attacks on the
power ﬂows, however, we use the Polish grid which is one
of the largest and most detailed publicly available real-
world power grids. To the best of our knowledge, there
are no other real power grids at this scale and detail avail-
able for academic research.5We use the Polish grid data
at its Summer 2004 peak–with 2736 buses, 3504 lines,
and 18GW of demand–and at its Summer 2008 peak–with
3120 buses, 3693 lines, and 21GW of demand. Both are
available through the MATPOWER library.
Since the total demand in the WSCC system is
315𝑀𝑊 , but the total demand in the Polish grid is about
20𝐺𝑊 , for comparison purposes, we focus on the per-
centage increase/decrease in the demand caused by an
attack instead of the number of switching on/oﬀ bots.
However, if we assume that all the bots are air condition-
ers, 1𝑀𝑊 change in the demand corresponds simply to

versity libraries, but they are limited to the topology with no extra in-
formation on the operational details.

switching on/oﬀ 1,000 bots. Therefore, we can deﬁne the
normalized botnet size in bots/𝑀𝑊 to be the number of
bots required to perform a successful variation of the Ma-
dIoT attack, if the total demand in the system is 1𝑀𝑊 .
By this deﬁnition, it is easy to see that to increase the
demand of any system by 1%, an adversary requires 10
bots/𝑀𝑊 .
4.2 Frequency Disturbances
In this subsection, we evaluate the ﬁrst two MadIoT
attack variations described in Section 3.2. We consider
two operational settings of the WSCC system: (a) high
inertia and (b) low inertia (for details see Fig. 6).
4.2.1
200–300 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Cause Sudden
Generation Tripping
In order to show the frequency response of the system
to sudden increases in the demand, we simulated the in-
crease of (a) 23𝑀𝑊 and (b) 30𝑀𝑊 in all the loads for
the high inertia and low inertia cases. These values can
roughly be considered as 20% and 30% increases in the
load buses, respectively. We similarly studied the fre-
quency response of the system to sudden decreases of the
demand. Figs. 7 and 8 present the results.
As mentioned in Section 2, the generators are protected
from high and low frequency values by protective relays.
These values depend on the type of a generator as well as
the settings set by the grid operator. Here, we assume the
safe frequency interval of 58.2𝐻 𝑧 and 61.2𝐻 𝑧 which is
common in North America (see Fig. 4). Once a generator
goes below or above these values, it gets disconnected
from the grid by protective relays.
As can be seen in Figs. 7(b) and 8(b), sudden increase
or decrease in the load buses by 30% or 20%, respectively,
cause the system’s frequency to go below or above the
frequency cut-oﬀ limits. Hence, an adversary requires
200–300 bots/𝑀𝑊 , or in this case 60–90 thousand bots,
to perform these attacks.
As can be seen, however, the drop/rise in frequency
is higher in the low inertia case (as predicted). There-
fore, there are cases in which the frequency may go be-

low/above the critical frequency in the low inertia case
but may remain in the safe interval in the high inertia
case (see Figs. 7(a) and 8(a)). This suggests that an at-
tack that is not eﬀective today, may be eﬀective tomorrow
if the system’s inertia is lower due to a higher rate of re-
newable generation.
In Figs. 7 and 8, the frequency cut-oﬀ limits of the
generators are ignored. Hence, the generators are kept
online even when the frequency goes beyond the safe
operational limits. In reality, however, these generators
are disconnected from the grid by the protective relays.
Fig. 9 presents the frequency response of the system when
the protective relays are enabled for the cases shown in
Figs. 7(b) and 8(b). As can be seen, the grid completely
shuts down and the simulations stop in less than 10 sec-
onds due to disconnection of the generators.
Simulation results in this subsection demonstrate that
the eﬀectiveness of an attack in causing a critical fre-
quency disturbance depends on the attack’s scale as well
as the system’s total inertia at the time of the attack.
4.2.2 100–200 Bots per 𝑀𝑊 Can Disrupt the Grid
Re-start
Once there is a blackout, the grid operator needs to
restart the system as soon as possible (a.k.a. a black start).
As mentioned in Section 3.2, due to frequency instability
of the system at the black start, the restarting process is
Figure 10: The WSCC 9-bus system during the black start.
usually done by restarting the grid in parallel in discon-
nected islands and then reconnecting the islands.
Fig. 10 shows one way of partitioning the WSCC sys-
tem into two islands. We assume that initially the grid
operator could restart the two islands and stabilize the
frequency at 60𝐻 𝑧. Then, before the two islands are re-
connected, an adversary increases the demand at all the
load buses with the same amount (see Fig. 11).
The attack is performed at time 30 and the two islands
are reconnected at time 50. As can be seen in Fig. 11(a),
when there are no attacks, the two islands are reconnected
with an initial small disturbance in the frequency and then
the system reaches a stable state.
Fig. 11(b) shows the frequency of the system after
20𝑀𝑊 increase in all the load buses at time 30. In this
case, the frequency goes slightly below the minimum safe
limit, but it is common in the black start process that the
generators’ lower (upper) frequency limits are set to lower
(higher) levels than usual. Hence, the system may reach
a stable state in this case as well.
As can be seen in Fig. 11(c), a 30𝑀𝑊 increase in all
the loads causes a large disturbance in the frequency, but
as the two islands are reconnected the system’s frequency
is completely destabilized. These substantial deviations
from safe frequency ranges can cause serious damage to
the generators and are not permitted even in the black
start process. Hence, in this case the system returns to
the blackout stage. Even if the grid operator decides not
to reconnect the two islands due to the frequency distur-
bances, Fig. 11(d) shows a signiﬁcant drop in the sec-
ond island’s frequency that results in disconnection of the
generators. Therefore, even if the big drop in frequency
of island 1 (1𝐻 𝑧 below the safe limit) is acceptable dur-
ing the black start, island 2 goes back to the blackout state.
For comparison purposes and to reﬂect on the role of
the operational properties of the system on the outcome
of an attack, we repeated the same set of simulations
with diﬀerent maximum power outputs for the genera-
tors’ governors (see Fig. B.1 in the appendix). We ob-
served that under the new settings, demand increases of
