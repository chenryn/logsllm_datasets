User: I want to completely reinstall Python 2 but none of the guides I have found allow me to uninstall it. No matter what I do, python --version still returns 2.7.10, even after I run the Python 2.7.11 installer. All the other guides on StackOverflow tell me to remove a bunch of files, but python is still there.
Assistant: Set your an alias to use the python version that you want to use from inside your .bashrc (or zsh if you use it).
Like: 
alias python='/usr/bin/python3.4'
