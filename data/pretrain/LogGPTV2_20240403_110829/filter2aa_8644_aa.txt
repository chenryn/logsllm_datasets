This guide is a collection of techniques for improving the security and privacy of a modern Apple Macintosh computer ("MacBook") running a recent version of macOS (formerly known as "OS X").
This guide is targeted to power users who wish to adopt enterprise-standard security, but is also suitable for novice users with an interest in improving their privacy and security on a Mac.
A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. There is no one single technology, software, nor technique to guarantee perfect computer security; a modern operating system and computer is very complex, and requires numerous incremental changes to meaningfully improve one's security and privacy posture.
This guide is provided on an 'as is' basis without any warranties of any kind. Only **you** are responsible if you break anything or get in any sort of trouble by following this guide.

This guide is also available in [简体中文](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide/blob/master/README-cn.md).

## Basics
Standard security best practices apply:
* Create a [threat model](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling)
	* What are you trying to protect and from whom? Is your adversary a [three letter agency](https://theintercept.com/document/2015/03/10/strawhorse-attacking-macos-ios-software-development-kit/) (if so, you may want to consider using [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) instead); a nosy eavesdropper on the network; or a determined [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat) orchestrating a campaign against you?
	* [Recognize threats](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf) and how to reduce attack surface against them.
* Keep the system up to date
	* Patch the base operating system and all third party software.
	* macOS system updates can be completed using the App Store application, or the `softwareupdate` command-line utility - neither requires registering an Apple account. Updates can also be downloaded directly from Apple's support site.
	* Subscribe to announcement mailing lists like [Apple security-announce](https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce).
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest
	* In addition to full disk encryption, consider creating one or several encrypted partitions or volumes to store passwords, cryptographic keys, personal documents, etc. at rest.
	* This will mitigate damage in case of compromise and data theft.
* Assure data availability
	* Create [regular backups](https://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0596102461/backupcentral) of your data and be ready to format and re-install the operating system in case of compromise.
	* Always encrypt locally before copying backups to external media or the "cloud".
	* Verify backups work by testing them regularly, for example by accessing certain files or performing a hash based comparison.
* Click carefully
	* Ultimately, the security of a system can be reduced to its administrator.
	* Care should be taken when installing new software. Always prefer [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) and open source software ([which macOS is not](https://superuser.com/questions/19492/is-mac-os-x-open-source)).
## Preparing and installing macOS
There are several ways to install macOS.
The simplest way is to boot into [Recovery Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201314) by holding `Command` and `R` keys at boot. A system image can be downloaded and applied directly from Apple. However, this way exposes the serial number and other identifying information over the network in plain text, which may not be desired for privacy reasons.
*Packet capture of an unencrypted HTTP conversation during macOS recovery*
An alternative way to install macOS is to first download the latest version of macOS (**Latest: macOS Ventura**) from Apple via the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-ventura/id1638787999) and create a custom installable system image.
This can also be done from the Terminal using the commands outlined in [OSXDaily](https://osxdaily.com/2020/04/13/how-download-full-macos-installer-terminal/).
```
softwareupdate --list-full-installers
# latest is 13.3.1
softwareupdate -d --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 13.3.1
```

### Verifying installation integrity
The macOS installation application is [code signed](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-SW6), which should be verified to make sure you received a legitimate copy, using the `pkgutil --check-signature` or `codesign -dvv` commands.
To verify the code signature and integrity of macOS application bundles:
```console
$ pkgutil --check-signature /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app
Package "Install macOS Ventura":
   Status: signed by a certificate trusted by macOS
   Certificate Chain:
    1. Software Signing
       Expires: 2026-10-24 17:39:41 +0000
       SHA256 Fingerprint:

           68 C5 BE 91 B5 A1 10 01 F0 24
```
Use the `codesign` command to examine an application's code signature:
```console
$ codesign -dvv /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app
Executable=/Applications/Install macOS Ventura.app/Contents/MacOS/InstallAssistant_springboard
Identifier=com.apple.InstallAssistant.macOSVentura
Format=app bundle with Mach-O universal (x86_64 arm64)

Info.plist entries=32
TeamIdentifier=not set

```
### Creating a bootable USB installer
Instead of booting from the network or using target disk mode, a bootable macOS installer can be made with the `createinstallmedia` utility included in `Contents/Resources` folder of the installer application bundle. See [Create a bootable installer for macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201372), or run the utility without arguments to see how it works.
To create a **bootable USB installer**, mount a USB drive, and erase and partition it, then use the `createinstallmedia` utility:
```console
$ diskutil list
[Find disk matching correct size, usually the last disk, e.g. /dev/disk2]
$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
$ diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk2 1 JHFS+ Installer 100%
$ cd /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app
$ sudo ./Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/Installer --nointeraction
Erasing disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 100%
Copying to disk: 0%... 10%... 20%... 30%... 40%... 50%... 60%... 70%... 80%... 90%... 100%
