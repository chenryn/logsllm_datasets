When attempting to use the Julia package `Images` with `julia-debug`, the process crashes, and the following error message is displayed:

```julia
julia> using Images
julia-debug: dump.c:2117: jl_recache_type: Assertion `t->uid != 0' failed.

gsignal at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (unknown line)
abort at /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (unknown line)

```

I have tried using both a self-compiled version of Julia and the official binaries from the Julia website (Version 0.4.6, released on 2016-06-19). The system is running on an x64 Ubuntu 16.04.1 OS.
