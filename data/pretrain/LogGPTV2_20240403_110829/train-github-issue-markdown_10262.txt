Certainly! Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional version of your text:

In the TypeScript source code, specifically in the `services.ts` file at line 1172 (see [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/blob/ab9ce1e9e6636ec6a2aa4f01458525f249c4edf5/src/services/services.ts#L1172)), I would expect these elements to receive special treatment. For example, the template string:

```typescript
`Hello ${name}`
```

could be tokenized as follows:
- `string("Hello")`
- `punct(${)`
- `identifier(name)`
- `punct(})`
- `string("`")

This approach would provide a more granular and detailed representation of the template string's structure.

I hope this meets your needs! Let me know if you need any further adjustments.
