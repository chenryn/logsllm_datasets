moved on to better open-source options that are far less resource intensive and less of a privacy concern. 
Remember, when working in our VM, we are borrowing resources from our host machines, so we need to use 
lightweight applications whenever possible. I prefer Draw.io for most investigations. It is most commonly used 
online as a browser-based diagram solution. When you browse to the site it will prompt you to create a new 
diagram, but first click on "Change Storage". Select "Device" and check "Remember this setting" to establish 
that we will be saving our work locally rather than with Google or Microsoft. Once you select either a blank 
diagram or one of the many templates, you will be ready to start building a link chart representing your 
investigative diagram. Before moving on, consider a more private option by installing the offline desktop 
application in your Linux VM. The following steps should be conducted in your OS1NT Original VM before 
launching a cloned investigation machine.
• 
Click "Extras" at the top and select one of the additional themes. I use 
for anything being printed, but 1 find that dark works well visually.
• 
At the bottom of the "Shapes" panel on the left, click "+More Shapes...".
• 
Browse through and check any sets that look useful and click "Apply". One I always include is "Web 
Icons" under "Other". The "Web Icons" and "Web Logos" work very well for OSINT charts and the 
icon styles tend to be more modern than the default selections included in the offered templates.
• 
There is also a + button in your toolbar that will allow you to import your own images into the chart 
or even draw shapes freehand.
Once the application is running, choose to create a new diagram, and a window will open offering you several 
templates. Some of the options in the network category work well for OSINT, or you can start with a blank 
project. Draw.io is very intuitive, allowing you to select icons on the left and drag them into your chart. Any 
linear icons (lines or arrows) are connectors and can be used to represent relationships between entities on the 
diagram. Double-clicking on text will allow you to edit the labels. The toolbar at the top and the right-click 
context menu offer many additional options for editing or adding components to the link chart. Save and export 
options are in the "File" menu. Draw.io suppons export in the most common filetypes such as pdf, docx, png, 
and html. When you first install Draw.io the default settings will present charts which appear a bit outdated due 
to the art style of the standard icons. Changing the following settings can fix this.
Draw.io is very flexible and you could use it to create timelines or event maps. However, I like to have multiple 
options for any task. The following descriptions are of two other applications for dedicated timeline and 
mapping tools.

Event Viewpoint is a free, browser-based timeline and mapping application. It will allow you to create events 
made up of a location, designated span of timc/date, and event notes. You may add images and view your case 
as a list, timeline, or geographical map. An example is seen in Figure 30.07. You will need to sign up for a free 
account using a non-attributable email address. Event Viewpoint is not open source and does collect some user 
data so make sure to use a clean browser and VPN. I never use these types of browser-based applications to 
work with sensitive data.
Time Graphics is a premium browser-based timeline tool and you will need to make an account using a valid 
email address. Only premium users can save privatized projects, but you can select a two-day free trial. The 
interface is driven by an intuitive right-click context menu and will allow you to add events, pictures, video, and 
notes. Figure 30.08 shows an example. You can export your project in several formats including pdf, docx, and 
json.

PDFsam Basic is a free and open-source application for merging 
and Windows, but the Linux version is the perfect fit for our 
straightforward, as follows.
A new combined pdf document will be created in the same directory’ as the source documents. PDFsam Basic 
has many more features that will allow you to manipulate your pdf documents, such as removing or rotating a 
single page within a long document. The main menu is accessible by clicking on the house shaped icon on the 
top right of the application. To the right of that, the icon made up of three stacked horizontal lines will take you 
to the settings page. Here you can change the default output directory’, should you want to make it your case 
folder. The premium versions of PDFsam are closed source, costing roughly' S60 a year, and primarily’ offer 
more options to edit and convert the documents into other filetypes such as docx. 1 find the free version 
sufficient for my needs.
This installation provides a new icon in the Applications menu. Opening the application presents a user-friendly 
menu with many options. The "Merge" function will compile pdfs into a single file with the following steps.
The appendix of a report is made up of all the supporting documentation and media captured during the 
investigation. This will be screen capture files, still frames from YouTube evidence, spreadsheets of social media 
contacts, and any other digital evidence that can be displayed in a document format. These are working copies 
only, with the digital originals preserved on external media or other format approved by’ your agency's digital 
evidence policy. Many of your tools are going to generate pdf files which you will then need to include in your 
report appendix. If you have Adobe Acrobat DC you can easily’ combine the working copies of your pdfs into 
a single document for easier distribution. The free versions of Acrobat do not support combining or conversion 
of multiple documents. I prefer an open-source option that does not require an account with Adobe, such as 
the following.

Case Archiving & Cleanup
494 Chapter 30
It should be noted that removing metadata can potentially break formatting or corrupt the entire file; therefore, 
it is wise to create a backup copy prior to metadata removal. You can also use third-party scripts and tools to 
clean documents, such as the Metadata Anonymization Toolkit (https://github.com/jubalh/MAT) for Linux. 1 
find that these tools are more prone to breaking documents created in Microsoft and Adobe products. Thus, 
for those types of documents, I use the built-in removal tools described above.
will execute a scan and any concerns will display a red exclamation point. Typically, these will be in the 
"Properties'' or "Header, Footers, and Watermarks" sections. 1 often want to keep footnotes and do not remove 
this section. However, next to "Properties" click "Remove all". This will delete most of the metadata such as the 
username of the author. This is by no means a complete cleanse, but is an easy way to remove low hanging fruit.
Upon completing a report, I collect my analog and digital case work and archive it for future use. The length of 
retention of these notes, virtual machines, screen captures, and repons are dependent on the policies of my 
organization or the expectations of the client for contracted work. When appropriate 1 keep handwritten notes 
for six months and digital documentation for at least three years. Should the case be later adjudicated, 1 have the 
documentation available. It is also not uncommon to have a current target resurface in a future investigation, in 
which case those digital notes will give you a head start on that new case.
A final warning for users of OneNote or other digital notebooks. The search capabilities built into OneNote are 
very useful when querying subjects for any previous work your team has completed. However, hoarding data 
long-term can leave you with an awful mess if you do not have a system for archiving old cases. I have an archive 
notebook for each year and within it sections broken down by7 month. Any completed cases get moved to the 
archive, and at the end of each month I review any remaining sections to assess their status. Then, at the end of 
each year, I go through all my notebooks to tidyr up any' loose ends and consider purging any archived notebooks 
that have gone untouched for longer than three years. Another approach is to export older notebooks and save 
them to optical discs or other long-term storage. In your own agency, please ensure that you implement an 
organization system that works for your workflow and one that is also compliant with retention/audit policies.
Keep in mind an old, but still very effective, method for removing metadata from non-evidentiary documents 
is using a scanner. Just print your report and scan the paper report back to a digital format using a scanner. The 
new document will have metadata based on the scanner/copy7 machine rather than your own accounts or 
workstation. If this scanner is an enterprise grade copier, it likely saves this data temporarily to a hard-drive and 
you would never want to use this technique with sensitive documents.
In the toolbar, you will see an option to "Sanitize Document". Think of this as the express option for removing 
metadata as it will use a set of default removal choices to perform the same task that we previously7 did. 1 prefer 
the former method for most projects, as I like to have more granular control over what is removed.
To perform a similar metadata removal in Adobe Acrobat, click on "Tools" and under "Protect & Standardize", 
click "Redact". r\ new set of options will show up just below the top toolbar. Click "Remove Hidden 
Information" and a panel will open on the left side of the application showing a running scan of your document. 
Under "Results" you can sec what types of data were found. You should uncheck boxes next to any items that 
you do not want removed. When you click "Remove", anything with a check mark will be deleted permanendy 
from your document. These changes are not applied until the next time you save the document. To do this, click 
"File", then "Save As" and give your cleaned document a unique filename, such as Policy_y6_san.pdf. Whenever 
possible, I tty to use naming conventions that convey the state of the file such as adding "san" or "clean" to 
indicate it has been sanitized.

The following pages represent the evidence of these findings. Please note that all screen captures were 
in digital format and are included within the DVD attached to this report.
’ me 11, 2017, Mr. Davis received an invitation through a Facebook Event from his sister, Jane 
Davis to attend a retirement celebration at Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. This event was scheduled to 
Saturday, June 17, 2017.
Much of this chapter has focused on large investigations which require in-depth note-taking applications and 
visual analysis tools. This may be overkill for you. I end the chapter with reporting options for smaller 
investigations. This section attempts to convert your minimal evidence into digestible reports. I believe the first 
consideration for smaller OSINT reports should be the "Executive Summary". This document should be limited 
to one page, and it should only focus on the absolutely vital evidence found during your investigation. Think of 
it as the "elevator pitch". You have only a few minutes to present what you found. There is no time to explain 
how a reverse-video search works or about the ways you can exploit a Facebook account with a user ID number. 
The following page displays a typical Executive Summary'.
• According to his deposition, Mr. Davis’ chiropractor is Neil Stevens in Ladue, Missouri. Dr. Stevens 
ordered Mr. Davis on bedrest until further notice on June 14, 2017, and continued this order on July 
27, 2017.
• On June 13, 2017, Mr. Davis claimed to sustain a back injury' while working at the South Plant on June 
12, 2017. Fie was sent home on the 13th, and has not returned to work since.

Investigator Michael Bazzell
On November 12, 2017,1 was requested to conduct an investigation into John Davis, a former employee that 
has made claims against y'our company' in reference to being injured on the job. Upon completion of my 
investigation, I have collected 143 relevant screen captures of online evidence that validates your resistance to 
his claims. The following pages include detailed analysis of the online content, but this cover page summarizes 
the most damaging evidence found that contradicts his previous deposition testimony. 1 find the following facts 
to be most useful.
• Dr. Stevens' daughter possesses an Instagram profile indicating that she is best friends with the daughter 
of Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis' daughter attended a sleepover at Dr. Stevens' home on March 12, 2017. Dr. 
Stevens is an avid hunter, as is Mr. Davis. On September 22, 2017, Mr. Davis and Dr. Stevens placed 
second in a duck hunting competition in Boone County, Missouri. Online records confirm they were 
on die same team.
• On August 12, 2017, Mr. Davis posted a review on Amazon for a steel rack for mounting onto an ATV. 
The review included, "This thing survived five miles of rough terrain last week, and my rifles didn't get 
one scuff... I will never go hunting without this on my 4-wheeler".
• On June 18, 2017, Jane Davis posted numerous photos to her Facebook profile, including an image of 
Mr. Davis lifting a keg of beer above his head.
