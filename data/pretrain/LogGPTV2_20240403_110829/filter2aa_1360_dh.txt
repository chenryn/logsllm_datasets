Transitioning to more efficient and privacy-conscious open-source alternatives is often beneficial, especially when working in a virtual machine (VM) environment. Since VMs borrow resources from the host machine, it's crucial to use lightweight applications whenever possible. For most investigative work, I recommend Draw.io, a widely used, browser-based diagramming tool.

### Getting Started with Draw.io

1. **Accessing Draw.io:**
   - Visit the Draw.io website.
   - When prompted to create a new diagram, first click on "Change Storage."
   - Select "Device" and check "Remember this setting" to save your work locally, avoiding third-party storage with Google or Microsoft.

2. **Choosing a Template:**
   - You can start with a blank diagram or choose from various templates. For OSINT investigations, some network category templates are particularly useful.

3. **Enhancing Draw.io for Privacy:**
   - Consider installing the offline desktop application in your Linux VM for added privacy. Follow these steps in your OS1NT Original VM before launching a cloned investigation machine:
     - Click "Extras" at the top and select an additional theme. I prefer dark themes for visual clarity.
     - At the bottom of the "Shapes" panel on the left, click "+More Shapes..." to browse and add useful sets like "Web Icons" and "Web Logos," which are modern and suitable for OSINT charts.
     - Use the "+" button in the toolbar to import custom images or draw shapes freehand.

### Using Draw.io

- **Creating a New Diagram:**
  - Choose to create a new diagram, and a window will offer several templates. Select one that suits your needs or start with a blank project.
  - Draw.io is intuitive; you can drag icons from the left panel into your chart and use connectors (lines or arrows) to represent relationships between entities.
  - Double-click on text to edit labels. The toolbar and right-click context menu provide additional editing options.

- **Saving and Exporting:**
  - Save and export options are available in the "File" menu. Draw.io supports common file types such as PDF, DOCX, PNG, and HTML.
  - To update the default settings and improve the appearance of your diagrams, change the following:
    - Themes
    - Additional shape libraries
    - Custom icons and logos

### Alternative Tools for Timelines and Mapping

- **Event Viewpoint (eventviewpoint.com):**
  - A free, browser-based timeline and mapping application.
  - Create events with locations, time spans, and notes. Add images and view your case as a list, timeline, or geographical map.
  - Requires a non-attributable email address for sign-up. Use a clean browser and VPN for added security.

- **Time Graphics (time.graphics):**
  - A premium browser-based timeline tool.
  - Offers a two-day free trial. Premium users can save privatized projects.
  - Add events, pictures, videos, and notes. Export in formats like PDF, DOCX, and JSON.

### Combining PDFs with PDFsam Basic

- **Installation:**
  - In your Linux VM, navigate to https://pdfsam.org/download-pdfsam-basic/ and download the Debian package.
  - Right-click the file and choose "Open with Software Install," then click "Install."

- **Using PDFsam Basic:**
  - Merge multiple PDFs into a single document.
  - Access the main menu via the house-shaped icon and settings via the three horizontal lines icon.
  - Change the default output directory if needed.
  - The free version is sufficient for most needs, though premium versions offer more editing and conversion options.

### Managing Metadata and Document Security

- **Removing Metadata:**
  - Use the "Sanitize Document" option in the toolbar for quick metadata removal.
  - In Adobe Acrobat, go to "Tools" > "Protect & Standardize" > "Redact" > "Remove Hidden Information" to remove specific metadata.

- **Archiving and Cleanup:**
  - Archive analog and digital case work based on organizational policies.
  - Implement a system for archiving old cases, such as yearly and monthly sections.
  - Consider exporting older notebooks to long-term storage and purging unused archives after three years.

### Reporting for Smaller Investigations

- **Executive Summary:**
  - Limit the summary to one page, focusing on the most vital evidence.
  - Provide a concise overview without technical details.

- **Example Executive Summary:**
  - Include key findings and relevant dates.
  - Summarize the most damaging evidence contradicting the subject's claims.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage and present your investigative work, ensuring both efficiency and privacy.
