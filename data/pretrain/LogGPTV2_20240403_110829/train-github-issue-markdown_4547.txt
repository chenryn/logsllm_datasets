# ðŸš€ Feature request
I was just reading how `make style` can be automated with pre-commit hooks.
Noticing how often I run and even more often forget to run `make style` before
committing, perhaps others are in the same boat - and therefore I thought to
propose to the dev community to (mostly) automate this process. The only cons
is that each dev will still have to run `pre-commit install` once after
cloning the project. This is a security feature of git, so it won't run
anything automatically unless you take action to enable such thing.
If I understand it correctly, if an individual dev doesn't run `pre-commit
install` inside the repo, things are just as normal as they are now. That dev
will just run `make style` manually. i.e. the proposed feature is optional for
those who want it.
I read about it here, please scroll down to the section: "Black as a Git pre-
commit hook". And it links to the whole detailed website: https://pre-
