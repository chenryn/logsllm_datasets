# Dark Data: An Investigation by Svea Eckert and Andreas Dewes

## Why We Are Here
On March 23, 2017, the US Senate voted to eliminate broadband privacy rules that would have required Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to obtain explicit consumer consent before selling or sharing web browsing data. This decision has significant implications for user privacy.

## What Does This Mean?
This means that ISPs can now sell your browsing data without your explicit consent, potentially revealing sensitive information about your online activities.

### Example:
- **ARD, Panorama, 03.11.2016**
  - A politician's search for "Tebonin" (a medication) was revealed, connected with their name.
  - **Quote from an employee of Helge Braun, CDU – Assistant Secretary of the German Chancellor:**
    - "I don’t know why I was searching for 'Tebonin' at that time. It’s really bad to see something like this, especially when it is connected with my own name."

## How We Did It: The "Hacking" Part
### Social Engineering
We used social engineering techniques to gather data and then applied statistical methods to de-anonymize it.

### Our Data Set
- **3,000,000,000 URLs (insufficiently anonymized)**
- **9,000,000 domains**
- **3,000,000 users**

**Data Format:**
- `https://www.google.com/?q=xxxx... [user id] [timestamp] ...`
- 30 days of data per user

### Statistical Deanonymization
**Process:**
1. **Anonymized User Data**: Contains user IDs and visited domains.
2. **Public/External Personal Data**: Contains identifiable information (e.g., names).
3. **Matching**: By cross-referencing these datasets, we can identify specific users.

**Algorithm:**
- **Step 1**: Generate a user/domain matrix \( M \).
- **Step 2**: Generate a vector \( v \) with information about visited domains.
- **Step 3**: Multiply \( M \cdot v \).
- **Step 4**: Identify the best match using \( \text{argmax} (w) \).

**Example:**
- **Domain**: `www.gog.com`
- **Users**: 15,561
- **Matches**: 1,114,408

### Extracting Public Information
#### Examples
- **Twitter API**:
  - Download tweets from a relevant time period (one month).
  - Extract URLs and generate associated domains.
  - Feed domain information into our algorithm.
  
  **Sample Results:**
  - `github.com` (2,584,681 visits)
  - `www.change.org` (124,152 visits)
  - `fxexperience.com` (394 visits)

- **YouTube Playlists**:
  - Download public playlists (often linked via Google+).
  - Extract video IDs using the YouTube API.
  - Feed video IDs into our algorithm.

  **Sample Results:**
  - `02Zm-Ayv-PA`
  - `18rBn4heThI`
  - `2ips2mM7Zqw`

- **Other Sources**:
  - **Google Maps URLs** (contain latitude/longitude).
  - **Facebook Post IDs** (URLs were anonymized but IDs were shared).

### Instant Deanonymization via Unique URL
A unique URL can instantly reveal a user's identity.

### What We Found in the Data
- **Legal Requests**:
  - **Example**:
    - **Subject**: Computer fraud investigation
    - **IP Address**: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    - **Timestamp**: xx.xx.2016, 10:05:31 CEST
    - **Contact**: PI:EMAIL or fax

- **User Queries**:
  - "Where do I find tilde on my keyboard?"
  - "What is IP 127.0.0.1?"

### Who Collected the Data?
- **Browser Plugins**: We tested in a virtual machine and found that certain plugins, such as WOT (Web of Trust), were collecting data.

- **Example**:
  - `[DATUM] 11:15:04 http://what.kuketz.de/`
  - `[DATUM] 15:49:27 https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/p-anzeige-bearbeiten.html?adId=xxx`

- **Impact**:
  - 95% of the data came from only 10 extensions (variants/versions).
  - Up to 10,000 extension versions are affected (upper bound analysis via extension ID).

### Why Use Extensions for Tracking?
- **Tracking Server**: Extensions can send data to a central server for tracking purposes.

### How Can You Protect Yourself Against Tracking?
- **Rotating Proxy Servers**: Use services like TOR or a VPN with rotating exit nodes.
- **Client-Side Blocking**: Use tools to block trackers.

### Can You Hide in Your Data by Generating Noise?
- **Answer**: Usually not. The algorithm is robust against isolated (additive) perturbation.

### Takeaways
- **Few External Data Points**: Only a few external data points (<10) are often sufficient to uniquely identify a person.
- **Public Information Increase**: The increase in publicly available information makes de-anonymization via linkage attacks easier than ever before.
- **High-Dimensional Data**: High-dimensional, user-related data is very difficult to robustly anonymize, even with significant effort.
