Why we are here
“US Senate voted to eliminate broadband privacy rules 
that would have required ISPs to get consumers' explicit 
consent before selling or sharing Web browsing data (...)“

I don‘t know, why I 
was searching for 
“Tebonin” at that 
time.
This is really bad to 
see something like 
this – especially if it is 
connected with my 
own name.

What did we get?
Our data set
3.000.000.000
9.000.000
3.000.000
URLs
(insufficiently anonymized)
Domains
Users
https://www.google.com/?q=xxxx...   [user id]    [timestamp] …
30 days of data per user
Statistical Deanonymization

How does it work?
...
anonymized user data
public / external personal data
User 1
User 2
User N
Identifier
(e.g. name)
e.g. „user 1 visited domain X“
Let‘s try this!
...
...
...

...
Domains
Users
=> sparsely populated matrix with 9.000.000 x 1.000.000 entries
Our Algorithm
▪ Generate user/domain matrix M
▪ Generate vector v with information
about visited domains
▪ Multiply M·v
▪ Look for best match
M = (...)
w = M·v
i = argmax (w)

But how can public information be extracted?
Two examples
Twitter
• We use the Twitter API to
download tweets from the
relevant time period (one
month)
• We extract URLs from the
tweets and generate the
associated domain by
following the links
• We feed the domain
information into our algorithm
users (arbitrarily sorted)
number of matching domains

Gotcha!
Examples
Seemingly harmless identifiers can betray you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs
Youtube
▪ We download public playlists
from users (often linked via 
Google+)
▪ We extract the video IDs using
the Youtube API
▪ We feed the resulting video
Ids into our algorithm (this
time initialized with video IDs 
instead of domains)
users (arbitrarily sorted)
number of matching videos in profile

More ways to
extract public
information
▪ Google Maps URLs 
(contain
latitude/longitude)
▪ Facebook Post IDs 
(URLs were
anonymized in the
data set but IDs 
were shared)

What did we find in the data?
Ladies and Gentlemen, because of an investigation concerning computer fraud
(file number), which I have dealt with here, § 113 TKG i.V.m. § 100j StPO I need
information on following IP address: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx Time stamp: xx.xx.2016, 
10:05:31 CEST
The data is needed to identify the offender. Please send your answer by e-mail
to the following address
PI:EMAIL or by fax.
first name
Last Name
Detective Chief Place of county
Cybercrime
phone number
Where do I find tilde on my keyboard
What is IP 127.0.0.1

How many extensions are affected?
95 % of the data comes
from only 10 extension
(variants/versions).
Many more are spying on 
their users, but have a 
small installation base.
Up to 10.000 extension
versions affected (upper
bound analysis via 
extension ID).
rank of extension
number of data points from extension
Why use extensions for tracking?
tracking server
(How) can I protect myself against tracking?
Rotating proxy servers (n >> 1)
e.g. TOR or a VPN with rotating exit
nodes
Client-side blocking of trackers
Can I hide in my data by generating noise?
(e.g. via random page visits)
Usually not
¯ \_(ツ)_/¯
argmax ||M·v|| is robust against isolated (additive) perturbation
Takeaways
Often, only a few external 
data points (<10) are suffcient
to uniquely identify a person.
The increase in publicly available
information on many people
makes de-anonymization via 
linkage attacks easiert than ever
before.
High-dimensional, user-related data
is really hard to robustly anonymize
(even if you really try to do so).
