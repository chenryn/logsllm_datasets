Challenge http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-learn-how-script-
tags-and-document-ready-work has an issue.
The way the last two directions are written is _very_ confusing:
**Add $(document.ready(function() { to the beginning of your script
element.)**
**Close your $(document.ready(function() { function with });.)**
It took me awhile (maybe I was just being slow today) to realize that you
don't need to repeat the script element: **$(document.ready(function() { }**
