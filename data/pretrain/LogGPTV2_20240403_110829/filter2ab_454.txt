### Title: Blackhat: EU-22 - How We Organize Large-Scale DDoS Exercises in the Netherlands

In January 2018, the Netherlands experienced a significant surge in DDoS attacks, highlighting the need for a more coordinated and robust response. In response, we implemented a national-level initiative for cooperative DDoS mitigation. This led to the formation of the Dutch Anti-DDoS Coalition, a voluntary consortium comprising seventeen organizations from diverse sectors, including ISPs, banks, internet exchanges, non-profit DDoS scrubbing centers, government agencies, and the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration.

Despite their varied backgrounds, these coalition members share a common goal: to enhance the resilience of Dutch online services by collaboratively combating DDoS attacks. The Coalition's unique approach is built on several complementary collaborative capabilities:

1. **Shared Expertise and Experience**: Coalition members pool their knowledge and experiences to develop best practices.
2. **Metrics and Attack Characteristics Sharing**: Members exchange data and insights on DDoS attack patterns and characteristics.
3. **Joint DDoS Exercises**: The Coalition conducts large-scale DDoS exercises to test and improve defenses.
4. **Public Information Dissemination**: The Coalition provides the public with information about DDoS attacks and how to mitigate them.
5. **Promotion of Security Standards**: The Coalition advocates for and promotes security standards that help protect against DDoS attacks.

Initially, our focus is on "critical" service providers, with plans to extend the initiative to other organizations in subsequent phases.

During the presentation, we will provide an overview of the Dutch Anti-DDoS Coalition and its various working groups. One key working group is responsible for organizing large-scale DDoS exercises. These exercises are conducted twice a year in a RED/BLUE team setting, with the aim of transitioning to a PURPLE team environment. 

We will delve into the technical, organizational, and legal aspects of organizing such exercises, providing valuable insights into the challenges and solutions involved in this collaborative effort.
