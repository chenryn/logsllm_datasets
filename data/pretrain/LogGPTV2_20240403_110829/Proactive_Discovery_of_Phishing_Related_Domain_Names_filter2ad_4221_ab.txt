A complete example of label generation is illustrated in Figure 2 for the level
2 (main domain) with (1), the selection of the length of the label in words, and
(2) the selection of the ﬁrst word that starts the label. The Markov chain is
applied for the remaining words to generate (3). For each word at the step (2)
and (3), DISCO is applied to generate other words. The same scheme generates
TLD for the level 1 without using DISCO.

3 Dataset
For assessing our approach, two datasets are selected. The ﬁrst one is a ma-
licious dataset composed of domain names from which maliciousness has been
conﬁrmed. The second dataset is a legitimate dataset containing non-malicious
domain names. In a ﬁrst step, these will be used to show that the features intro-
duced in section 2.2 allow to discriminate phishing domain names from legitimate
ones. In a second step, the malicious dataset will be used to show the eﬃciency
of the generation of phishing domain names.
3.1 Malicious Dataset
To compose the dataset of malicious domain names, three freely downloadable
blacklists are used. These have been selected because each of them proposes an
historical list of blacklisted domains ordered by their discovery date. These have
been collected during at least the last three years. This is an essential dataset
requirement in order to test the predictability of the approach.
• PhishTank6: PhishTank is a community website where anybody can submit
a suspicious phishing URL that will be further checked and veriﬁed. The
downloaded historical blacklist contains 3,738 phishing URLs.
• DNS-BH7: DNS-Black-Hole aims to maintain an up-to-date list of domains
that spread malware and spyware. A list of 17,031 malicious domains is
available.
• MDL8: Malware Domain List is another community project aimed at cre-
ating and maintaining a blacklist of domains involved in malware spreading.
This list contains 80,828 URL entries.
DNS-BH and MDL are not only dedicated to phishing, but also to malware
diﬀusion. These two lists have been chosen because as described in [1], diﬀu-
sion of malware designed for data-stealing and particularly crimeware is a big
part of phishing activities. This various dataset allows also to strengthen the
validation of our approach (introduced in section 4). Following the extraction
of the distinct domain names from the 101,597 URLs and the deletion of dupli-
cated entries between the three lists, the ﬁnal dataset contains 51,322 diﬀerent
two-level-domains. Out of these 51,322 domain names, 39,980 have their main
domain divisible in at least two parts.
3.2 Legitimate Dataset
The objective is to faithfully represent realistic normal domain names. This
dataset is selected to show that even if malicious domains use some brands

included in the URLs of famous websites in order to mimic them, they still
disclose diﬀerences. Two sources are chosen to compose this ”legitimate” dataset.
• Alexa9: Alexa is a company that collects browsing behavior information
in order to report statistics about web traﬃc and websites ranking. From
Alexa’s ”top 1000000 sites” list, 40,000 domain names are randomly picked
in the top 200,000 domains.
• Passive DNS: To diversify this dataset and in order to have the same
amount of domain names in each dataset, we had it completed with 11,322
domain names extracted from DNS responses. DNS responses were passively
gathered from DNS recursive servers of some Luxembourg ISPs. We ensure
that these domain names are not present in the initial dataset from Alexa.
The normal dataset contains 51,322 entries. 38,712 names have their main
domain divisible in at least two parts. Hence, we have two datasets: a legitimate
one and a malicious one of equivalent size.
4 Experiments
4.1 Datasets analysis
In this section metrics and statistical parameters extracted from each dataset are
compared to demonstrate that features described before are able to distinguish
malicious from legitimate domains. A ﬁrst proposition is to analyze the number
of words that composes the main domain name #len2,n. Main domains that
can be split in at least two parts are considered. The malicious dataset contains
39,980 such domain names and the legitimate dataset 38,712. Figure 3 shows the
distribution of the ratio of main domains that are composed from 2 to 10 words
(distlen2,n | n ∈ {2; 10}) in the legitimate dataset and in the malicious dataset.
69% of legitimate main domains are composed of two words whereas only
50% of malicious are. For all upper values, the ratio for malicious domains is
higher than for legitimate ones. This shows that malicious main domains tend
to be composed of more words than legitimate main domains.
The following analysis studies the composition similarity between the domain
names of the diﬀerent datasets. Two probabilistic distributions are extracted
from the domain names:
• the diﬀerent labels of the TLDs: ∀w ∈ W, P1(w) = distword1,w
• the diﬀerent words that compose the main domains: ∀w ∈ W, P2(w) =
distword2,w
We used the Hellinger Distance to evaluate the similarity in each dataset and
dissimilarity between datasets. The Hellinger Distance is a metric used to quan-
tify the similarity (or dissimilarity) between two probabilistic distributions P

It’s an instance of f-divergence as well as KL-divergence metric. Hellinger
Distance is symmetric and bounded on [0; 1] where 1 is a total dissimilarity
(P ∩ Q = ∅) and where 0 means that P and Q have the same probabilistic
distribution.
This metric is preferred rather than more usual metric such as Jaccard Index
or KL-divergence. Jaccard Index only considers the presence or not of an element
in two datasets but never considers the probability associated to an element. KL-
divergence metric is an non-symmetric measure as well as unbounded function
([0; +∞]). Finally, KL-divergence requires that Q includes at least the same
elements of P : ∀iP (i) > 0 ⇒ Q(i) > 0. This constraint may not be satisﬁed with
our datasets.
The malicious dataset and legitimate datasets are randomly split in ﬁve
smaller subsets, respectively mal-x and leg-x | x ∈ {1; 5}, of equivalent size
(∼ 10000 domains). Table 3 shows the Hellinger Distance for TLDs distribution
between all the subset P1(w). Globally all the TLDs are quite the same in all
subsets (0  0, the number of states corresponds to Card(W ) |
∀w ∈ W, #wordsl2,w > 0 and the number of transitions before implementation
of Laplace smoothing is Card(U 2) | ∀(w1, w2) ∈ U 2, #biwordsl2,w1,w2 > 0. This

table strengthens the assertion that words present in malicious main domains are
more related together than those present in legitimate main domains, because
Hellinger Distance is lower between malicious subsets compared to legitimate
subsets despite the higher number of words (states) in the Markov chain created
from the malicious dataset.
These experiments show that our model built on top of blacklist will be able
to generate proactively maliciously registered domains with a limited impact
regarding legitimate ones.

4.2 Types of generated domains
The dataset chosen for the rest of the experiments is the whole malicious dataset
introduced in section 3.1. This dataset is split in two subsets and depending
on the experiment performed, the domains selection technique to compose the
subsets and the number of domains in each subset vary. One of these subsets
is called the training set, from which the features described in section 2.2 are
extracted in order to build the word generation system depicted in Figure 2,
section 2.1. Based on it, new domain names are generated and their maliciousness
is conﬁrmed only if they belong to the second subset called the testing set.
The term probing campaign is deﬁned as the generation of one million of
unique two-level-domains that are checked in term of existence and malicious-
ness. A domain name is considered as existing if it is actually reachable over the
Internet, i.e. it is mapped to an IP address. For each generated domain, a DNS
A request is performed and according to the DNS response status, the domain
name is considered as existing (status = NOERROR) or non-existing (status =
NXDOMAIN). For more information about DNS and its operation, the reader must
refer to [17–19].
The ﬁrst step of the experiments aims at analyzing the existence and the type
of generated domains. Figure 4 is an histogram depicting the run of ﬁve probing
campaigns using a generation model trained on 10% of the malicious dataset,
each of the ﬁve complete rectangle represents the number of existing domains
generated. We can see that over one million unique domains probed, between
80,000 and 110,000 so around 10% are potentially reachable over the Internet.
These existing domains are divided in three categories represented distinct ﬁlling
pattern in the histograms.
The white one represents the number of wildcarded domains. Domain wild-
carding is a technique that consists in associating an IP address to all possible
subdomains of a domain by registering a domain name such as *.yahoo.com. As
a result all DNS queries sent for a domain containing the suﬃx yahoo.com will be
