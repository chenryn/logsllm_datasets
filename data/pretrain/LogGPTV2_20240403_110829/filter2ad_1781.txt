Message from the Tutorials Chair
Scienti(cid:2)c Panel
Tutorials are an important part of the DSN program.
They provide an opportunity for attendees to acquire a ba-
sic understanding of, and familiarity with, several state of
the art topics related to the dependability, security and re-
silience of systems and networks. Tutorial proposals pro-
viding guidance on how technology can be applied success-
fully in practical systems were particularly encouraged.
This year, nine tutorial proposals were submitted. From
these, (cid:2)ve tutorials were selected using a two-phase proce-
dure. In the (cid:2)rst phase, all proposals were carefully evalu-
ated by a scienti(cid:2)c panel composed of Anish Arora, Danny
Dolev, Shivakant Mishra, Michel Raynal, Neil Speirs and
myself. The panel prepared a recommendation that was dis-
cussed, in a second phase, by the DSN steering committee
in cooperation with the DSN organizers. The (cid:2)nal selection
considered many different issues such as, but not limited
to, the relevance to the DSN attendees of the subject ad-
dressed, the quality of the tutorial structure, the merit and
quali(cid:2)cation of the speakers, but also practical aspects such
as logistic constraints.
Due to the high quality of the submissions received, DSN
2007 is able to offer an excellent set of tutorials on very
timely and relevant topics. On behalf of the tutorial scien-
ti(cid:2)c panel, I wish to thank all of the authors that submitted
proposals and made it possible to assemble such a strong
tutorial program. I would also like to thank the members
of the scienti(cid:2)c panel for their insightful contribution to the
selection process. Finally, I would like to thank the DSN
2007 organization, and in particular Tom Anderson and Mo-
hamed Ka(cid:136)aniche, for all the support provided to our panel.
