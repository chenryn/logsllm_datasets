### Table 4: Blacklist Performance Aggregated by Each Batch (Average of All Deployments)

#### Consistency Across Deployments
- **Opera** maintained consistent speed across five deployments.
- **GSB and SmartScreen** showed statistically significant differences in speed, with a p-value below 0.01, likely due to the complexity of anti-phishing systems, processing order, and data sharing methods.

#### Mobile vs. Desktop Performance
- **Mobile Firefox** showed inconsistencies with desktop counterparts.
- **Deployment 3** saw a dramatic drop in coverage for both non-evasive and evasive phishing, which was not due to technical issues but possibly related to PayPal's reporting system.

#### Blacklist Persistence
- URLs remained blacklisted for at least 29 days after initial reporting, indicating that de-blacklisting is not a significant issue.

### Evasion Techniques

#### Experiment B: Mobile User Agent Cloaking
- **Effect on Desktop Blacklisting:** Negligible.
- **Mobile Devices:** Both GSB and Opera had 0% coverage.

#### Experiment C: Redirection Techniques
- **Bit.ly Links:** Slowed blacklisting to 02:58, reduced coverage to 86.1%.
- **.com Domain Names:** Slowed to 02:48, reduced coverage to 88.9%.
- **.htaccess Cloaking:** Slowed to 02:43, reduced coverage to 84.3%.

#### Experiment D: Re-deployment on Same .com Domains
- **Increased Speed and Coverage:** Still slower than experiments without redirection.
- **Immediate Blacklisting:** Only 4.3% of URLs were blacklisted immediately.

### Emerging Evasion Techniques

- **CAPTCHA Cloaking:** 42.6% coverage in SmartScreen, but easily bypassed.
- **Human Interaction Required:** Advanced cloaking techniques require human interaction, posing a challenge for web crawlers.

### Single-entity Reporting

- **APWG vs. PayPal:** APWG resulted in higher coverage and more crawler traffic, while PayPal was faster but less effective.

### Evidence-based Reporting

- **Traditional URL Reporting:** Immediate burst of crawler traffic, 20.4% blacklisted.
- **CSSR Reporting:** Slower initial speed, 90.7% coverage within 24 hours, more sustained crawler traffic.

### Crawler Traffic Analysis

- **Total Requests:** 2.14 million HTTP requests from 41,750 distinct web crawler IPs.
- **Consistent Traffic:** Observed consistent, very high levels of traffic over time, except during Deployment 3.

### Conclusion

- **Delays and Gaps:** Exist in blacklisting, providing opportunities for attackers.
- **Recommendations:** Improve data sharing, enhance detection of advanced evasion techniques, and report phishing to multiple entities.
