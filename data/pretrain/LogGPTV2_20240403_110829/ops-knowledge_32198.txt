User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 workload_contention 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This code is designed to diagnose workload contention issues in a database system. The function checks for several potential causes of contention, including abnormal CPU and memory resource usage, insufficient space in the database data directory, and excessive connections or thread pool usage. If any of these issues are detected, the function provides a detailed report of the problem and suggests potential solutions. If no issues are found, the function returns "not a root cause".

- max_process_memory
- dynamic_used_memory
- max_dynamic_memory
- other_used_memory
- tps
- max_connections
- db_cpu_usage
- db_mem_usage
- disk_usage
- connection
- thread_pool_rate
