Sometimes it is useful to create array of forms and render them in template
separately with the same name ($form->getName()). But in this case Profiler
will display only the last form in Panel, because FormDataCollector uses
$form->getName() as index and the last form overrides previous forms.
Possible solution is to fix this code to somethink like
    $name = $form->getName().'_'.uniqid();
    $this->data['forms'][$name] = array();
In this case profiler will collect multiple forms correctly.
