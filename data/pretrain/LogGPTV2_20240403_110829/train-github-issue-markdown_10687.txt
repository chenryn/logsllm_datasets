When working with multiple forms in an application, it can be useful to create an array of forms and render each one separately in a template, all using the same name (i.e., `$form->getName()`). However, this approach can lead to an issue where the Profiler only displays the last form in the panel. This occurs because the `FormDataCollector` uses the form's name as the index, and thus, the last form in the array will overwrite the previous ones.

To address this, you can modify the code to ensure that each form has a unique name. One possible solution is to append a unique identifier to the form's name, like so:

```php
$name = $form->getName() . '_' . uniqid();
$this->data['forms'][$name] = array();
```

By doing this, the Profiler will correctly collect and display all the forms, even if they originally had the same name.
