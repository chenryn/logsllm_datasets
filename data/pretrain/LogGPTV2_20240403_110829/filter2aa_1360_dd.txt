If you followed the prior steps for tab management, these subfolders should match up with any strong leads 
that you have opened in their own windows. At die conclusion of your investigation, the digital evidence is 
nicely organized by its corresponding identifier and tools.
You should now have a reliable, repeatable process for working through your OSINT queries and capturing 
results in your paper and digital notes. The final piece of the research phase is capture and collection. This is 
made up of the steps involved in preserving content for evidentiary or reporting purposes. There are three 
approaches to collection depending on the tools you have available.
Manual capture includes any technique that is user-initiated and results in capturing a single file or multiple files 
within a single page. These are often browser-based tools such as JavaScript or extensions. Here are the steps to 
integrating manual capture into your workflow.
• 
Create a case folder in your VM shared directory named logically for your case.
® Open that case folder and create a new folder matching the corresponding category from your toolset. 
If 1 am working on an email address this will be "Email Addresses".
® Open that director)’ and create a folder tided appropriately for the identifier you are querying. If 
email address is the target, the folder may be tided similar to "PI:EMAIL".
• 
Repeat this for any other strong leads such as Twitter usernames, names, domains, etc.
9 Now you have a logically structured set of folders to store any saved digital content.
• 
As you work through your set of tabs specifically for that lead, capture any pages that support your 
findings and save those to this folder.
• 
Any time you save an image or video related to that lead, also save it to this director)’ using any of the 
tools referenced earlier in the book.
• 
Any time you save a specific image or video, you should also save a screen capture of the page from 
where you obtained it. This shows visually how diat image or video was laid out on the page. The 
capture of the entire page is saved to the same folder where you placed the image or video it references.

Analysis
470 Chapter 29
Scripted capture is made up of the manually activated programs that collect or "mine" digital content on our 
behalf. A good example of this is using Instaloader to rip all of the photos from a specified Instagram account 
These types of tools were covered earlier in the book, and there are only a few things to keep in mind on how 
they fit in our workflow, as explained below.
• 
For scripts that prompt you for a save location, you should use the same 
manual capture: a series of logical nested folders.
• 
Some scripts wall store collected data in a default directory, such as Downloads or Documents. In these 
cases, complete the collection and then manually move the files over to your case director}7. When 
reasonable, move rather than copy files to limit clutter and abandoned case data.
• 
Add a line to your notes indicating which script was used, what it was directed to collect, and the date 
and time. Unlike Hunchly, most of these tools do not annotate or generate a log of their actions.
• 
If you are collecting digital evidence for use in court, you should consider also conducting a manual 
capture of any crucial items. The problem with scripts is that you may not be able to explain how they 
work in court. A manual save is easy to explain confidendy to a jury when the time comes to testify.
The primary’ goals of link analysis is to understand how information is connected, and a way to visually represent 
these connections. These can be people, locations, websites, phone numbers, or any other identifiers you see 
associated with online accounts. Figure 29.05 displays a link analysis showing how an email address was linked 
to a social media profile. You will see specific examples of link analysis tools in the following chapter. Not all 
cases require a link chart, but you should consider its value when faced with complex organizations or anytime 
your case might benefit from a visualization of how entities or accounts are connected.
Whether you are working your case independendy or have the support of a dedicated team, the research phase 
will include some level of multimedia analysis. This is the process of examining the visual and metadata 
characteristics of recovered images and video. Visual examination is exactly what it sounds like. View each image 
or clip at the highest resolution possible and methodically examine media for any intelligence that was 
unintentionally included in the frame. You are looking for things like business signage in the background of your 
target's profile photo. Identify anything that narrows down who or where they might be, and include this in your 
case notes. This process can be very time consuming, but it remains one of the best methods of locating an 
elusive target who has otherwise covered their online tracks.
• 
Create a new Hunchly case named the same as your investigative notebook and your digital evidence 
director}7.
• 
Click the Hunchly extension icon on the top right of your Chrome browser and make sure it is set to 
capture and that it is set to the correct case name.
• 
Proceed with your research in Chrome as described in the previous sections. Any time you find an 
image that is key to your case, right-click it, select the Hunchly entry on the context menu, and choose 
"Tag Image". Provide a logical caption and click "Save".
• 
Hunchly can later generate a forensically sound report containing all tagged images.
The best example of a passive capture tool is Hunchly. It records pages loaded in Chrome at the source code 
level, as well as any images on those pages. It is providing a wide safety’ net, but you should be more intentional 
in taking advantage of its capture capabilities. The following steps assume you have Hunchly and Chrome 
installed in your custom OSINT VAI. If you are not a Hunchly user, you may skip this section and move on to 
scripted capture.

Once your research is complete, you will need to prepare your report. Several of the steps in this workflow were 
in preparation for the reporting phase. If you have followed along diligently, your efforts -will be rewarded by 
painless report creation. Chapter Thirty is dedicated to taking all of the intelligence that you have collected and 
using it to build a professional case report.
Some major case investigations take place over a series of days or even months, while critical incidents may 
require you to give a threat assessment in 20-30 minutes. Your workflow will remain the same for each situation, 
but the time spent on each step will obviously be reduced. When you reduce the "time-to-solve" drastically, 
there will be compromises made to the quality of work and security. A common scenario where I use a 
streamlined workflow is a threat assessment, such as a person threatening suicide in an online chatroom. 
Consider the following threat assessment steps and Case Workflow chart on the following page.

Transfer any handwritten notes to either your digital notes or final report. If you prefer, you can scan 
the notes as a pdf using your scan enabled printer or scanning straight to OneNote. Any paper notes or 
printouts are then either filed in a secure location and in compliance with your agency’s policies or they 
are shredded.
• 
Do not leave case assets scattered about or they will get mixed in with future case work. Your 
investigative directories should be archived in accordance with your agency's evidence submission and 
retention policies. Some teams retain copies of these "working files" on network attached storage or 
optical discs for 3-6 months. If the subject should resurface, as criminals tend to do, having historical 
notes from previous incidents can be a huge time saver.
• 
If appropriate, export a copy of the VM that you used for the case. Then return to a clean snapshot or 
clone as described in earlier sections of this book. Consider preparing fresh accounts for the next 
investigation and find replacements for broken tools.

Each example will try to show the standard path that I would take when provided the chosen type of data, such 
as an email address. The goal with my investigations is to get to the next topic. For example, if I am given an 
email address, my goal is to find any usernames and real names. When I have a username, my goal is to find any 
social networks and verify an email address. When I have a real name, the goal is to find email addresses, 
usernames, and a telephone number. When I have a telephone number, my goal is to verify the name and identify 
a physical address and relatives. When 1 have a domain name, my goal is to locate a real name and address. The

dictated the avenues and routes that would lead me to valuable intelligence. There was no cheat-sheet that could

whether he is likely to carry’ out the threat. Identify’ if there is a non-OSINT solution such as 
a human resource.
• 
Knoll Your Tools: Grab your legal pad and a pen. Ideally you will have a fresh instance of your OSINT 
VM ready to use. If you do not have this prepared ahead of time, use "utility" social media accounts. 
Utility social media accounts are those on hand for non-criminal assessments where speed is essential 
and cross-contamination is a reasonable concession. Using fresh accounts would be preferable, but that 
just isn't always possible.
• 
Collaboration: If you are collaborating with a team on a platform such as OneNote, create a page for 
each user to paste key findings so that you don't confuse one another. Keep in mind that OneNote in 
a browser syncs almost instantly, whereas several users on OneNote desktop will have syncing issues. 
Assign one person to keep track of everyone's progress and build out the big picture.
• 
Premium/Govcmment Resources: Run your target through any commercial aggregators and 
government databases. These checks should go very’ quickly and return low hanging fruit.
• 
OSINT: Begin with Google searches such as: site:4chan.org "username". Then query’ your target's 
known identifiers through your custom OSINT tools.
• 
Only open very’ promising links in new tabs and visually scan each page quickly’ for words or images 
that jump out at you. The images results can be especially useful on time sensitive assessments because 
your brain can process them exponentially faster than text.
• 
For anything useful, make a note on your legal pad and leave the corresponding tab open.
• 
Be prepared to give a briefing at the deadline, even if it is just a situational report similar to "we've 
located and preserved the original posting, there's a history’ of similar suicidal threats from that user, 
but we do not know who or where he/she is yet".
• 
Take care of any additional collection, analysis, and reporting once the crisis has passed. At that point 
you will fall back into the normal workflow and documentation steps.

Many readers have requested practical exercises in order to test their 0S1NT skill. I agree that this would be 
helpful, but maintaining active and accurate online demonstrations with live data can be overwhelming. Instead, 
1 encourage you to test your skills with real data, unknowing to the target. Consider the following scenarios, and 
use the flowcharts here as a guide.
Zillow: Pick a random home and find all info about the previous owners.
Wrong Number (incoming): Reverse-search it, text them their details.
Wanted Criminals: Locate any significant others’ online profiles with photos.
Waiter/Waitress: Research your server from dinner last night and identify their vehicle.
AirBnB; Locate all details about a host (owner) and email them directly.
Radio: Pick a morning "Happy Birthday" target, obtain full DOB and relatives' comments online. 
Reviews: Find 5 people that have patronized a local business and locate their home addresses. 
Game Show Contestant: Identify full address, phone number, photos, and relatives.
Newspaper: Choose a person quoted in today's newspaper and identify’ their social networks. 
News: When a local Facebook comment is cited, explore the hidden data about the person. 
Library: Locate an employee's Amazon wash list and buy them the book he or she wants (creepy).

of your queries can lead you to more places than

This list could grow for many pages. Overall, there are endless targets available that provide the best practice 
possible for exercising these techniques. This practice will increase the confidence in your research during an 
actual investigation. The hard part is not disclosing what you find to them. While you may think they will be 
impressed with your new skills, they won't. Trust me...
I believe that all of these will always be a work in progress. As everything else in OS1NT changes, these will too. 
I will try’ to keep them updated on the website. If you have suggestions, I am honored to receive and apply them. 
If you would like to create better formulas, I encourage you to get creative. I used the sendee LucidChart 
(lucidchart.com) to create each of these. I also made all of these public within the LucidChart website so that 
you can take advantage of my starting point. The following links will connect you to a live environment that will

Consider the Email flowchart presented in two pages from now. The written translation of this would be to take 
the email address and search it within the TruMail email validation tool. Next, conduct searches of the address 
within quotation marks on the main search engines. After that, check the compromised databases and all options 
on the IntelTechniques Email Addresses Tool. These options are likely to lead to a presence on social networks. 
Following these to the bottom of the chart encourages you to conduct the email assumptions previously 
mentioned, which you can verify and start over with the newly acquired information. You would then continue 
through the remainder of the chart. If you find the following information beneficial, you are welcome to
