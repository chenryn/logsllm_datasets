This  last  epoch  is  not  a  total  loss.    Cryptographic 
subsystems  and  related  standards  and  protocols  have 
undergone considerable advancement. 
DES  has  grown  to  triple  DES.    And  the  Advanced 
Cryptography Standard (ACS) holds significant promise.  
However  where  once  DES  was  anointed  adequate  to 
protect  sensitive  by  unclassified  information,  there  is  a 
troubling  lack  of  such  pronouncements  for  the  ACS.   
Most  troubling  however,  is  that  most  cryptography 
products  are  built  on  platforms  that  lack  a  basis  for 
believing their security mechanism cannot be subverted

Export  restrictions  have  been  greatly  relaxed  and  the 
government  is  not  knocking  on  as  many  doors  to 
respectfully  request  manufactures  to  pull  products  from 
the market.  Almost twenty years ago a large chip vender 
was encouraged to stop building a quality key generator, 
leading one  manufacturer to replace the use of that chip 
with the manual rolling of eight sided dice.   Since then, 
the  engineering  of  security  products  that  incorporate 
cryptography  has  become  considerably  easier.    On  the 
other  hand,  the  understanding  of  probing  cryptographic 
solutions for weaknesses has also advanced considerably,

Cryptography has become a relatively popular area of 
study,  and  new  algorithms  are  subject  to  systematic 
review – which is good because there is no real science to 
cryptography.  It has few absolute metrics, relying instead 
on assertions of relative strength such as: “it is as difficult 
to break as factoring large numbers to their primes”.   
The  application  of  cryptography  has  been  greatly 
enhanced  by  standards  such  as  IPSEC  which  can  make 
the  engineering  of  VPNs  a  whole  lot  more  likely  to  be 
sound.    Even  standards  like  SSL  have  usefulness  in

on  platforms  having  weak  security.    And,  the  recent 
neglect of the science of computer and network security 
suggests this won’t be corrected soon.  As a result of this 
major  weakness  in  cryptographic  deployment,  it  has  in 
many  cases  become  what  has  been  referred  to  as  the 
“opiate of the naive”.  
  This  is  not  a  unique  insight  of  the  author,  but  has

The irony is that some of our very early PC chips 
were designed to provide a higher degree of security, 
but this has never been made available.  
In the early 1980s, Intel developed a secure chip 
called the Intel 286 chip which formed the heart of a 
secure system known as GEMSOS, one of the most 
highly trusted computer systems ever built and used 
by the US Government. 
6.2.   Advances in the State of the Science 
The epoch of decline delimited by the publishing of 
the Common Criteria did not include much in the way of 
advances  in  the  state  of  the  science  of  computer  and 
network  security.    However,  there  were  considerable 
advances  in  the  area  of  available  cryptographic  tools, 
including: 
•  Widely Available Crypto Subsystems 
•  Digital Certificates and PKI 
•

IPSEC for VPNs 
The  state  of  the  science  of  information  security  is 
quite  rich  with  solutions  and  tools  that  represent  the 
accumulated knowledge from research over more than 30 
years.   The state of our assimilation of that knowledge by 
information  security  practitioners  and  understanding  of 
the  existing  science 
  The  greatest 
achievement  in  the  science  of  computer  and  network 
security is the ability to build and deploy truly bulletproof 
systems  having  verifiable  protection.    And  this  remains 
the most powerful solution available for many of today’s 
hard problems.
