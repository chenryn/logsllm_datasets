**ATT&CK ID:** T1547.004  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Winlogon Helper DLL

Adversaries may exploit features of `Winlogon` to execute malicious DLLs or executables when a user logs in. `Winlogon.exe` is a critical Windows component responsible for handling logon and logoff processes, as well as the secure attention sequence (SAS) triggered by pressing `Ctrl-Alt-Delete`.

To manage additional helper programs and functionalities that support `Winlogon`, registry entries are used. These entries are located in the following paths:
- `HKLM\Software[\Wow6432Node\]\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`
- `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`

By modifying these registry entries, adversaries can inject malicious code into the `Winlogon` process, allowing them to execute their payloads at system startup or during the user logon process.
