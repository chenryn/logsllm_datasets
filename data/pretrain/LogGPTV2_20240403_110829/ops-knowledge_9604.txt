Assistant: Possible causes and solutions: 1) Check and modify the syntax and record settings in the forward and reverse parsing zone files under /var/named; 2) Check the zone declaration in the /etc/named.conf configuration Whether the writing is wrong; 3) Check whether the bind-chroot software package is installed, if installed, the regional database file should be in the /var/named/chroot/var/named directory; 4) Check the /etc/resolv.conf configuration file Whether the correct nameserver is set. Detailed steps: 1) Open the terminal and log in to the DNS server as an administrator. 2) Use the cd command to enter the /var/named directory. 3) Edit the forward analysis area file and the reverse analysis area file, check whether the grammar and record settings are correct, and make necessary modifications. 4) Use the cd command to return to the upper-level directory and enter the /etc directory. 5) Use the sudo vi named.conf command to open the named.conf file, check whether the zone statement is written correctly, and make necessary modifications. 6) Check whether the bind-chroot package is installed, you can use the command dpkg -l | grep bind-chroot to check, if installed, move the regional database file to the correct directory. 7) Use the sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf command to open the resolv.conf file, check whether the correct nameserver is set, and make necessary modifications. 8) Restart the DNS service to make the modification take effect.
