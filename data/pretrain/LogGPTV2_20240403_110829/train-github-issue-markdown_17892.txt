When adding int `1` to a numpy {u}int array, usually a type conversion to
int64 happens. This is normal. If, however, the type is `uint64`, the array
gets converted to `float64`. I had not expected that. Perhaps it's correct
though. Opinions?
MWE:
    import numpy
    a = numpy.array(0, dtype=int)
    print((a + 1).dtype)  # int64
    a = numpy.array(0, dtype=numpy.uint16)
    print((a + 1).dtype)  # int64
    a = numpy.array(0, dtype=numpy.uint32)
    print((a + 1).dtype)  # int64
    a = numpy.array(0, dtype=numpy.uint64)
    print((a + 1).dtype)  # float64!
