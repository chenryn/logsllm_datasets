Filing this as a close duplicate of #9299 because that issue is locked, and
with the release of Node v12, the createRequireFromPath boilerplate has become
more widespread, and it involves `import.meta.url`:
    import {createRequireFromPath as createRequire} from 'module';
    import {fileURLToPath as fromURL} from 'url';
    const require = createRequire(fromURL(import.meta.url));
As a Babel end-user, I don't know how to work around the `SyntaxError: Cannot
use 'import.meta' outside a module`, and leaving that issue open might allow
someone more knowledgeable to offer a solution.
I personally find it mildly infuriating when conversations are locked without
any spam or abuse problems, because nether I nor others can add anything that
might help each other. Sometimes the "final word" from the core team is less
than intelligible to those new to the topic.
