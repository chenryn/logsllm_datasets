How would you suggest I extend THREE.BinaryLoader? I'd like to augment it by
adding support for morph targets after the current loading code.
Would it be possible to add createBinModel() and parseMetaData() to
THREE.BinaryLoader (and change the call from
THREE.BinaryLoader.prototype.createBinModel( xhr.response, callback,
texturePath, json.materials ); to this.createBinModel( xhr.response, callback,
texturePath, json.materials ); ) so we could override them as necessary in a
subclass, or maybe add THREE.BrinaryLoader.init_extra_data( data, start )?
Thanks!
