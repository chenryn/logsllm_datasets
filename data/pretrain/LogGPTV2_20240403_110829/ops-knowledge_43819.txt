I am using a shared folder to exchange files between a Linux (Ubuntu) machine and a Windows machine. After editing a Python file on the Windows machine with Notepad++, I changed the file's owner to the Ubuntu user and ran the file. When I tried to edit the file again, I encountered the following error message:

"Please check whether this file is opened in another program."

Is this issue related to a Linux daemon? If both machines were running Windows, I could edit the file as an administrator, but I am new to Linux and unsure how to resolve this.

Thank you for your help!

**Response:**

To address this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Kill the Process:**
   - Identify and terminate the process that is currently using the Python file. You can do this by opening a terminal on your Ubuntu machine and running:
     ```sh
     lsof | grep <filename>
     ```
     This command will list all processes that have the file open. Once you identify the process ID (PID), you can kill it using:
     ```sh
     kill <PID>
     ```

2. **Reboot the Windows Machine:**
   - Sometimes, simply rebooting the Windows machine can release any locks on the file and allow you to edit it again.

Either of these methods should resolve the problem. If the issue persists, please provide more details about your setup and any additional error messages you may be seeing.

Best regards,
