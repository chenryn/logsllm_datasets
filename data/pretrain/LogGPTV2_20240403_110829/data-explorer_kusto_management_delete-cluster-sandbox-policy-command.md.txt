# .delete cluster policy sandbox command
Delete the cluster sandbox policy. Specified plugins run within [sandboxes](../concepts/sandboxes.md) whose resources are managed for security and resource governance. Sandbox limitations are defined in sandbox policies, where each sandbox kind can have its own policy.
Sandbox policies are managed at cluster-level and affect all the nodes in the cluster.
## Permissions
You must have [AllDatabasesAdmin](access-control/role-based-access-control.md) permissions to run this command.
## Syntax
`.delete` `cluster` `policy` `sandbox`
[!INCLUDE [syntax-conventions-note](../../includes/syntax-conventions-note.md)]
## Example
Delete the sandbox policy for a cluster.
```kusto
