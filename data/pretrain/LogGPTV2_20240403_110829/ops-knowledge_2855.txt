User: How to configure and manage disk storage on Linux system? Please teach the usage and optimization methods of LVM and RAID technology.
Assistant: The main tools for configuring and managing disk storage are fdisk, parted, LVM, RAID, etc. This article briefly introduces the usage and optimization methods of LVM and RAID technology. 1. LVM LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a tool for managing large-capacity disk storage. Its main function is to combine the space of multiple physical disks into a logical volume, and allocate storage space through the logical volume. LVM technology is widely used in Linux systems. Here are some commonly used LVM management commands: 1. Create a physical volume: # pvcreate /dev/sda1 2. View the list of physical volumes: # pvdisplay 3. Create a volume group: # vgcreate vg1 /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb1 4. View volume group list: # vgdisplay 5. Create a logical volume: # lvcreate -L 2G -n lv1 vg1 6. View logical volume list: # lvdisplay 2. RAID RAID(Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) is a technology that combines multiple disks into a logical storage unit. Through RAID technology, the speed and capacity of multiple disks can be optimized to achieve higher performance and data redundancy backup. The following are some commonly used RAID technologies: 1. RAID 0 RAID 0 divides data into multiple blocks, and stores each block in a different disk for parallel read/write to improve data access speed, but there is no data redundancy backup, so there is no Applies to critical data. 2. RAID 1 RAID 1 is a mirrored RAID technology, which stores the same data in two different disks to ensure that the data is still available when one disk fails. 3. RAID 5 RAID 5 distributes data and verification information to different disks, provides data redundancy backup, and maintains good read/write performance. 4. RAID 6 RAID 6 is an extension of RAID 5. It has one more redundant disk than RAID 5, providing higher data redundancy backup. On the Linux system, you can use the mdadm command to manage RAID: 1. Create a RAID 5 disk group: # mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb /dev /sdc /dev/sdd 2. View RAID status: # cat /proc/mdstat 3. View RAID details: # mdadm --detail /dev/md0 The above is a brief introduction to the usage and optimization methods of LVM and RAID technology. Both LVM and RAID technologies can achieve higher capacity and higher performance storage systems, but they also require careful configuration and management to ensure data integrity and availability.
