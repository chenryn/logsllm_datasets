When using the class form-stacked on a form it gets pushed 20 pixels to the
left. When this is done it is not possible to put 2 span8's next to each other
without breaking the lay-out.
A work-a-round is to change form-stacked padding left to 0; Doing this will
brake the div.actions because it has a negative left-margin of 20px and
padding-left 20px to align with the inputs and labels above when there is no
modification made in form-stacked.
When you zero out the margin and padding the first button positions to the
most left position in the actions div.
Is there a better work-a-round to use spans for the divs inside a form with
the class of form-stacked?
