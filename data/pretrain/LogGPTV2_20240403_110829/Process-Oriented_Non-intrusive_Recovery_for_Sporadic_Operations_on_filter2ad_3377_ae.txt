### 5. Log Analysis
Software logging is a widespread practice (D. Yuan, et al., 2012), and the analysis of logs has become increasingly important for various purposes, such as system failure detection and diagnosis. Log analysis involves extracting useful information from log files and using this information to meet operator needs, such as process monitoring and failure detection (D. Yuan, et al., 2012; D. Jayathilake, 2012). While numerous tools exist for log analysis, many lack adequate support for structured log analysis, which is a significant limitation (D. Jayathilake, 2012). In the context of recovery, log analysis is a crucial step in developing a log-based system recovery method.

### 6. Cloud Infrastructure
Cloud infrastructure refers to the resources provided by cloud platforms, including cloud instances, data storage, auto-scaling groups, and elastic load balancers. It typically offers three service levels:
1. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Examples include Amazon EC2, Windows Azure, Rackspace, and VMware.
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: An example is Google App Engine.
3. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: An example is Apache web services (S. Paquette, et al., 2010).

Cloud infrastructure offers features that traditional non-cloud systems do not, such as the ability to dynamically create virtual machines or cloud instances on-demand and to scale applications in or out at runtime based on configured rules (S. Paquette, et al., 2010).

### 7. Virtual Machine Replication
Virtual machine (VM) replication in the cloud is a type of Hypervisor-Based replication (L. DuBois, 2013). At the hypervisor level, a VM in one location can be replicated to either the same or another site in real-time. If the original VM fails, the replicated VM can take over and continue providing services. A key challenge is ensuring that incremental data in the original VM is also copied to the replicated VM to maintain consistency and ensure accurate service provisioning.

### 8. Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
RTO specifies the maximum acceptable time for an application to be restored after a failure (T. Wood, et al., 2010). It is a fundamental objective in designing recovery methods.

### 9. Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
RPO defines the point in time to which the system must be recovered after a failure, typically the most recent backup (T. Wood, et al., 2010). It is another essential objective in recovery design.

### 10. Mean Time to Recover (MTTR)
MTTR is a critical metric in evaluating recovery performance (J. Zhu, et al., 2002). To minimize MTTR, several strategies can be employed, such as increasing network throughput or implementing effective recovery actions (D. Cannon and D. Wheeldon, 2009).

### 11. Recovery Scalability
Recovery scalability refers to a recovery method's ability to handle different scales of systems, from small to large. For example, Google's private cloud manages thousands of VMs with dynamic and elastic fault tolerance. A recovery method with good scalability can support both small and large-scale cloud systems, making it essential for cloud recovery mechanisms.

### 12. Sporadic Operations
Sporadic operations in the cloud refer to irregular and infrequent maintenance activities, such as installation, upgrades, and reconfiguration (J. Humble and D. Farley, 2010; L. Bass, I. Weber, and L. Zhu, 2015).

### 13. Normal Activities
Normal activities, or normal operations, are the standard, frequently performed tasks within cloud applications, such as business transactions in e-commerce systems (L. Bass, I. Weber, and L. Zhu, 2015; M. Fu, et al., 2016).

### 2.2 Existing Recovery Methods for Cloud

#### 2.2.1 Cloud Applications Rollback
System recoverability is a key aspect of dependability. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, proposed the "Three R's" for system dependability: Rewind, Repair, and Replay (A. B. Brown and D. A. Patterson, 2002). Rollback corresponds to the "Rewind" component. Rollback mechanisms can be categorized into checkpointing-based and logging-based (E. N. M. Elnozahy, et al., 2002). Checkpointing-based rollback includes uncoordinated, coordinated, and communication-induced checkpointing. Logging-based rollback includes pessimistic, optimistic, and causal logging. 

**Checkpointing-based Rollback:**
- Upon failure, the system rolls back to a previously saved consistent checkpoint.
- Challenges include managing the overhead of creating checkpoints and efficiently retrieving and understanding them.

**Logging-based Rollback:**
- Logs all nondeterministic events and necessary replay information.
- Challenges include efficient log generation, proper log analysis, and understanding log contents.

**Limitations:**
- Extensive checkpoint generation and log management can be inefficient.
- Limited visibility and control in cloud environments can complicate these processes.
- Both mechanisms may lose additional changes made after the last consistent state, leading to poor RPO satisfaction.

#### 2.2.2 Disaster Recovery in Cloud Computing
Disaster recovery mechanisms in the cloud range from geographical redundancy to cloud storage redundancy (M. Pokharel, et al., 2010; J. Zhang and N. Zhang, 2011). Geographical redundancy replicates data between distant data centers, while cloud storage redundancy requires multiple replicas in different locations.

**Typical Disaster Recovery:**
- Replicates application states between two data centers.
- Backup site takes over if the primary site fails.

**Challenges:**
- Double energy consumption, higher infrastructure costs, and increased human effort.
- Tools like Zerto and Yuruware support disaster recovery in clouds.

**Limitations:**
- Designed for node/zone-level failures and more suited for normal activities.
- Efficiency issues in cross-region data replication.
- Does not consider intentional changes during sporadic operations.

#### 2.2.3 Virtual Machine Replication in Cloud
VM replication is essential due to the uncertainty and instability of cloud resources (A. Colesa, et al., 2010). Asynchronous replication is recommended to minimize interruptions (B. Cully, et al., 2008).

**Asynchronous VM Replication:**
- Only changed states and incremental data are replicated.
- Example: Remus, which encapsulates protected software in VMs and asynchronously propagates changes.

**Challenges:**
- Determining replication frequency and avoiding service disruptions.
- Requires manual configuration, which can be error-prone.
- Increasing system scale can lead to longer MTTR and more complex data changes.

**Limitations:**
- Disturbances to running applications during replication.
- Manual work and potential configuration errors.
- Difficulty in meeting RTO and RPO goals as system scale increases.

#### 2.2.4 Fault-Tolerance in Cloud Computing
Fault-tolerance in cloud services aims to mask faults rather than fix them (B. Randell, et al., 1995). Existing strategies include Recovery Block, N-version Programming, and Parallel execution (A. Avizienis, 1995; Z. B. Zheng, et al., 2010).

**Recovery Block:**
- Redundant program modules where standby components take over if the primary fails.

**N-version Programming:**
- Multiple versions of a program run in parallel to ensure correctness.

**Parallel Execution:**
- Multiple copies of a program run simultaneously to detect and mask faults.

**Challenges:**
- Efficiently implementing fault-tolerance for different types of cloud services.
- Balancing resource usage and ensuring high availability.
