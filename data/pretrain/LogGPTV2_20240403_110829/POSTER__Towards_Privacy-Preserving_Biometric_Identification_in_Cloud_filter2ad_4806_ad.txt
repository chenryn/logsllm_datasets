with certain groups of population and although the biometric traits are expected
to exist among every individual, there could be some exceptions where a user
is unable to provide a particular feature, Jain et al. [98]. Unimodal biometric
systems are quite vulnerable to spooﬁng attacks where the data can be imitated,
Hadid et al. [82]. These limitations and vulnerabilities of unimodal models have
increased the necessity for more robust architectures, Rathgeb and Busch [172].
In the literature, there are several approaches for authentication mechanisms
based on multi-factor schemes that combine a single biometric modality and a
password, a PIN code or a token. Multi-factor authentication systems provide an
additional layer of security and make it harder for attackers to gain access to a
person’s information. Consequently, they are used on a daily basis in government,
health-care, ﬁnancial and business applications, Wazid et al. [223]. Moreover,
since every human possesses more than one forms of recognition, multimodalities
can be used to enhance the eﬃciency of the currently used models, Peng et
al. [164]. When adopting a biometric technology for recognition applications, the
most crucial pre-deployment question is whether to choose a unimodal, multi-
factor or multimodal biometric architecture. A recent report of 2018 presented by
IndustryARC [91] concludes that multimodal models that integrate the multiple
biometrics of a user have proven to be more secure and reliable, managing to
supersede the unimodal and multi-factor authentication designs due to their
eﬀectiveness and robustness while it addresses their applicability in the next
generation biometric systems.
Cavoukian and Stoianov discussed that the aim of using cryptography in
biometrics is to protect these pieces of data that are used for the recognition of
a claimed identity [47]. Although the task may sound simple, there are several
constraints and complications such as these presented by Bringer et al. in [35]
and Kanade et al. in [109]. Biometric characteristics are anthropometrics and
thus, their extraction, representation and matching imply classiﬁcation problems,
Menezes et al. [142] and Ross et al. [181]. A stored template hardly ever is
exactly the same as a newly captured trait, even if both are processed by the
same type of sensor. Secondly, the accuracy of biometric schemes is dependent
on False Acceptance Rates (FAR) and False Rejection Rates (FRR), known as
performance rates, Nandakumar and Jain [149]. Additionally, the utility of a
biometric feature in real-world applications is determined by certain properties,
such as uniqueness, measurability and spoofability among others as analytically
presented in the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [96]. In
2003, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) initiated a study
for quantifying the compatibility of biometric data according to their properties
6
INTRODUCTION
for their adoption in machine readable travel documents such as electronic
passports. Facial, ﬁngerprint and iris biometrics stated as globally interoperable
and they are widely used in a variety of applications, Bharadwaj et al. [20].
Although biometrics were initially introduced as a means to overcome the
security limitations of the traditional authentication approaches, they are tied
with the identity of the user, Jain and Kumar [99]. Hence, if biometric data are
not eﬃciently protected, they can be compromised and reveal more information
than necessary, violating the user privacy, Nandakumar and Jain [149]. Security
for biometric architectures is related to the technical characteristics of the
system and its overall robustness. In this direction, literature oﬀers several
approaches that have been proposed to hide the biometric data and to prevent
the linking of personal information, always maintaining the ability to accurately
verify a person’s identity. Schemes, such as cancelable biometrics and biometric
cryptosystems among others, can oﬀer advantageous solutions, Bolle et al. [30],
Kanade et al. [108] and Sutcu et al. [201]. Privacy is deﬁned here as the control of
the users over their own data and it plays an important role in public acceptance
of biometric designs, Kindt [115]. For biometric technology, security and privacy
have been treated as two factors that should be developed cooperatively.
Speciﬁcally, privacy cannot be preserved and achieved independently without
the enhancement of security. The balance between privacy and security and the
optimum trade-oﬀ lies on the system context, the targeted use-cases and the
risk assessments regarding the attackers’ capabilities, Prabhakar et al. [167].
Cavoukian in [45] and Kindt in [115] analytically explained that the deployment
and practical implementation of biometric schemes require compliance with the
evaluation criteria and the privacy principles as addressed by the legal framework
for the protection of biometric data. Finally, the ISO Standards for the biometric
principles and framework [93] underlines that the eﬀectiveness of cryptographic
methods for diﬀerent modalities and their combinations need to be resolved
according to the relevant privacy principles and security requirements that are
important to be addressed since they deﬁne their applicability.
Academia, industry, the military and security agencies invest in the research for
the development of provably secure and privacy-aware biometric technologies.
Even though over a decade of extensive analysis has brought many novel
biometric protection proposals, there is still a discrepancy between security
requirements and privacy demands in this relatively young discipline, Campisi
et al. [40]. Kindt analyzed that the existing eﬀorts to protect the privacy of
the users may be proven insuﬃcient, while the growth of information-analysis
technology has profound consequences, both good and bad [116]. The legal rules
that are currently developed to cope with these developments will determine
the limits of our freedom and privacy, Solve [198]. Through the prism of the new
European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [66] and the European

biometric technology is forced to revise the infrastructure and the evaluation
activities. The main objective in this direction is the design and implementation
of biometric architectures that prioritize the privacy awareness to address the
security issues against vulnerabilities and potential infringements.
1.1 Contributions of the Thesis
The aim of this thesis is to advance the understanding of security and privacy in
biometric systems. We mainly contributed to this ﬁeld in two ways. Firstly, by
analyzing the security and privacy of several schemes in widely used biometric-
based applications. Secondly, by proposing practical and eﬃcient solutions to
address the weaknesses we have identiﬁed and to make the biometric designs
more secure and privacy-friendly. To facilitate the evaluation of our work, we
map the contributions of our papers in Table 1.1.

We made the following contributions that can be summarized as follows:
1) Study the feasibility of using cryptography in biometric schemes.
A biometric system is a pattern recognition scheme that extracts and compares
the tested features of a user with the stored ones, from the process of a prior
enrollment. However, the existing biometric template protection techniques,
applied to enhance the secrecy of the stored data, can reduce the recognition
eﬃciency, Kanade et al. [109] and Simoens [193]. We conducted studies on

INTRODUCTION
whether cryptography can be used in unimodal, multi-factor and multibiometric
schemes without reducing the performance accuracy. Moreover, in this context,
we identiﬁed the types of biometrics that present fewer drawbacks and oﬀer the
necessary amount of information for user recognition. Finally, we analyzed the
optimal applicability of several cryptographic methodologies in order to improve
both the robustness and the performance reliability in biometric designs.
2) Privacy analysis of cryptographic mechanisms for the protection of
biometric data. It is a common belief that even when a biometric recognition
procedure is securely performed by a legal authority, sensitive information
about the users could be gathered and shared for other than the initially
deﬁned purposes, without any oﬃcial approval, Bertino [19]. Thus, during
the last decade, there is a rapid progress of development for regulations and
recommendations regarding the secure transmission and handling of user’s data
in biometric schemes. We identiﬁed and mapped the privacy principles and the
security properties that should be addressed in real-world biometric deployments.
We presented a complete analysis of the existing cryptographic approaches in the
context of privacy-preserving measures to assess their adequacy. We provided
a comparative study of the security and privacy advantages and weaknesses
of each technique following the currently used recommendations as addressed
in the ISO Standards for biometric information protection [92] and [96] and
the new European GDPR [66]. Finally, our work addressed the importance of
privacy-by-design solutions in biometric schemes.
3) Analysis of the performance accuracy and security evaluation
of multimodal designs. The consolidation of biometric information for
the design of secure multibiometric systems is an active research area with
numerous applications, Ross et al. [182]. Fusion constitutes a way to enhance
the recognition reliability of a system. However, the concept of multimodal
integration and the selection of a convenient model is a challenging task as
discussed by Meva and Kumbharana [143]. An important part of our work based
on studying and analyzing the matching accuracy and the security of multimodal
schemes. We studied the impact of performance rates in diﬀerent fusion strategies
and we analyzed the eﬃciency of the existing cryptographic approaches in
multimodal models. Finally, we identiﬁed the practical diﬃculties of designing
secure multimodal systems, while we proposed several methodologies for
enhancing security and privacy in diﬀerent multimodal recognition architectures.
4) Attacks on biometric architectures. We analyzed passive and active
attacks against unimodal and multimodal biometric designs. We identiﬁed
the feasibility of these attacks and the information that an intruder can
gain, compromising the authorized user privacy. We elaborated on possible
ways to overcome some of these challenges and we discussed the role of
cryptographic mechanisms in facing diﬀerent kinds of vulnerabilities related to
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE THESIS

the communication, templates’ storage, and computations on biometric data.
5) Framework of anti-spooﬁng measures. Spooﬁng attacks take place
directly at the biometric sensor of a recognition system by using artiﬁcial
biometric samples. An active adversary tries to claim a diﬀerent identity and
deceive the matching result. State-of-the-art research has shown that none of
the cryptographic schemes is completely spoof-proof, Marcel et al. [136]. We
analyzed the anti-spooﬁng methodologies and we studied the current mechanisms
in realistic scenarios. We identiﬁed their advantages and limitations and we
proposed potential improvements. Liveness-detection requires the cooperation
between the user and the function itself and tests if the biometric being captured
is an actual measurement from the authorized, alive person who is present at
the time of the capture procedure. According to our ﬁndings, this approach
can recognize and prevent a signiﬁcant number of spooﬁng attacks in unimodal
systems. Finally, motivated by the growth of illegal immigration that may
increase fraud, cloning and identity thefts with numerous social, economic and
political consequences, Rebera et al. [176], we proposed a bimodal architecture
that combines two modalities for automated border control able to detect
spooﬁng attacks. To reduce the risk of the exposure of the stored templates,
we used an encryption scheme based on the technique of crypto-biometrics.
Additionally, in our design we involved a liveness-detection module to increase
the security robustness, without compromising the matching accuracy.
6) Design of a secure and privacy-preserving system for biometric
authentication. The targeted use-cases, for example commercial, government
or ﬁnancial applications and the infrastructure of an architecture play an
important role in the applicability of a proposed cryptographic approach.
• We proposed a biometric authentication model for eFinance applications.
The system allows remote monitoring of the user’s account, using his
mobile device with an embedded ﬁngerprint sensor. To reduce the privacy
risks and increase the security, we implemented a multi-factor scheme
based on minimal extracted data (minutiae features of a ﬁngerprint) and
a PIN code as inputs to a Pseudonymous Biometric Identity (PI) recoder.
Through the use of the PI technique, there is no storage of sensitive
biometric data and user’s references. According to the ISO Standards
for the security framework in ﬁnancial services [94] and the evaluation
methods as presented in ISO Standards [95], we discussed the ways that
privacy could be addressed under the given scenario and how the security
recommendations were satisﬁed during the design process.
• Furthermore, biometric designs have attracted attention in online services.
However, even if cryptography is used, the context information of these
communications could lead to the leak of private data about users across
10
INTRODUCTION
the network, Butt et al. [38]. Even though several proposals on multimodal
fusion, performance rates and secure mechanisms for the protection of
biometric data can be found in the literature, the combination of these
ﬁelds is a challenging task. We proposed a design that incorporates the
performance rates in a multimodal fusion strategy. We designed a model
for authentication and identiﬁcation purposes. Finally, we discussed the
usability and the advantages of our approach and we analyzed what
cryptography can oﬀer to reduce the privacy and security threats.
• Our ﬁnal work was motivated by the fact that the storage of biometric
data in Centralized Biometric Databases (CBDBs) seriously increases risks
for the privacy of the users according to the analysis presented by Jain and
Kumar in [99]. Hence, there are extensive eﬀorts to discourage additional
and auxiliary Databases (DBs) with biometric templates. Moreover, the
adoption of biometric technologies for various applications has grown
exponentially over the last decade. Due to the increasing demand for
authentication solutions, cloud computing can serve as a means to deliver
biometric services over the Internet oﬀering numerous beneﬁts, such as
reduced cost, increased storage capacity, parallel processing capabilities
and ﬂexibility, Ashbourn [15]. Thus, cloud can oﬀer improved next
generation biometric technologies while it has an enormous potential
market value. We proposed a novel Biometrics as a Service (BaaS)
scheme and a less invasive, distributed approach for multimodal biometric
Authentication as a Service (AaaS) in the cloud. Our system performs
authentication, exploiting prior stored unimodal templates being collected
by Authentication as a Service (AaaS) and distinct untrusted Identity
Management as a Service (IdMaaS) providers. To obtain a multimodal
result, we used Hamming Distance algorithms and a user-speciﬁc weighted
score level fusion method. We performed an extensive threat and risk
analysis. Taking into account the severity of the security and privacy
concerns that may limit the design and implementation we used Multi-
Party Computation (MPC) techniques to build our privacy-preserving
protocols, allowing mutually distrusting parties to jointly compute the
matching score without revealing any private data. The extracted biometric
features, the stored templates, the fusion results or any derived information
from them are not exposed towards the parties involved in the computation.
We simulated the functionality, practicality and eﬃciency of our approach.
