User: I have a rather complex Excel 2010 file that I automate using python and win32com.  For this I run windows in virtual box on an ubuntu machine.
However, that same excel file solves/runs fine on Ubuntu Maverick directly using wine 1.3.  Any hope of automating Excel on wine so I can drop the VM?
Or is that just crazy talk (which I suspect).
Assistant: You'd need a Windows version of Python, not a Linux version -- I'm saying you'd have to run Python under wine as well.
Have you tried with just a normal Windows install of Python on wine? I don't see any reason why this wouldn't work.
There is are numerous pages in a Google search that show Windows Python (32-bit) working fine.
