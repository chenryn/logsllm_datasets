I just installed the latest version of Atom yesterday, and have been trying it
out. I had an unsaved file open and noticed that soft wrap was not on. I went
into the preferences panel, turned it on, and went back to my open file (not
saved yet) and soft wrap still wasn't applied.
Instead, I copied the text, and pasted it into a new unsaved file and soft
wrap was working then.
Maybe this happens for files that are already open too? Not sure.
