### Title: BluePill: Neutralizing Anti-Analysis Behavior in Malware Dissection at Black Hat EU 2019

In the field of malware analysis, creating transparent sandboxes is just one aspect of the challenge. When analysts delve into the structure and functional capabilities of complex malware samples, a significant portion of their time is spent circumventing various anti-analysis techniques. To address this, I present BluePill, a dynamic analysis framework designed to deceive malware into believing it is running freely, while in reality, it is under the scrutiny of an analyst.

Unlike recent solutions, BluePill can be seamlessly integrated with traditional analysis tools, effectively hiding their presence from the malware. The framework intercepts and alters evasive queries and adversarial sequences, such as environment fingerprinting and anti-debugging patterns, thus modifying the malware's perception of the system. Additionally, BluePill can fast-forward time to counteract time-based evasion and stalling tactics.

Analysts can debug the sample using the GDB remote protocol and benefit from a novel technique that conceals code modifications from anti-tampering mechanisms. Furthermore, BluePill provides taint tracking capabilities, which are invaluable for dissecting behaviors like evasion techniques.

Designed with analysts in mind, BluePill allows for customization of its hooks and the addition of new ones based on insights gained during the dissection process. This flexibility is particularly useful for targeted malware and emerging evasion techniques. Moreover, BluePill is immune to semantic gaps, ensuring consistent and reliable performance.

In this talk, I will demonstrate how BluePill can neutralize the tricks employed by recent evasive malware and executable protectors, enabling analysts to dissect them on a standard VirtualBox installation alongside classic analysis tools.
