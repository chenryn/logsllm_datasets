 _Copying from golang-dev_
The vendor specification doesn't seem to speak much about the visibility of
the vendored packages. Thus, should vendor be treated in similar ways to
internal?
As it currently is, the following program compiles under go1.6beta2 (with the
vendor experiment on):
    package main
    import "vendor/golang.org/x/net/http2/hpack"
    func main() {
        hpack.NewEncoder(nil)
    }
Is this expected behavior? It seems kind of odd that I can import hpack as
part of the "standard" library.
This is related to #13961 and #13929.
