be viewed as a corrupted version of rc.
diﬀer is less than 576, then the original
bits that x and x
′
rc can be correctly restored, i.e., rc = Encode(Decode(r
c)),
where Encode and Decode, respectively, are the encoding
and decoding algorithms of Reed-Solomon. With rc in place,
x is reconstructed as x = d ⊕ rc, and in turn k can be
computed k = HMAC(x; r).
Caveat. Normally care must be taken in selecting param-
eters of a Reed-Solomon code, due to the list decoding prob-
lem [15]. List decoding concerns the possibility to list all the
codewords at a Hamming distance larger than the classic er-
ror correction capability of the Reed-Solomon code. Casting
this to Fuzzy Extractor, it means that an adversary could
ﬁnd rc used in KeyTPLGen even without going through the
KeyRelease procedure, if the parameters of the code are not
strong enough to oﬀset the attack. We acknowledge that
we did not pay special attention to list decoding in selecting
the above Reed-Solomon code:
list decoding is in fact not
a serious threat in our case of public key suppression. The
reason: even an adversary managed to list all codewords, the
only way for him to decide the actual rc is by enumerating
every codeword to unwrap the biometric wrapped creden-
tial and then testing the recovered “credential” online with
the authentication server. Even so, it is prudent to take
the list decoding problem into serious consideration when
considering practical deployment.
5.2 Experimental Results
The experiments measured two metrics which determine
the feasibility of the proposal: one relates to biometric - FM-
R (False Match Rate) and FNMR (False Non-Match Rate:
the probability of a genuine sample is falsely interpreted as
non-match), and the other is performance of the anonymous
biometric authentication protocol. The client program was
coded as an Android App and tested upon a smartphone
with a 1.2GHz CPU and 2.0GB RAM, and the server pro-
gram was run on a PC, Intel 3.1 GHz CPU and 8GB RAM.
Table 2 reports the experimental results on biometric and
the client/server computation performance. Speciﬁcally, in
FMR tests, for each ﬁnger we used all other ﬁngers’ impres-
sions against it (as per KeyRelease), and obtained 0.8% FM-
R; for FNMR tests, we tested each ﬁnger by using its own
other 5 impressions against the one used in KeyTPLGen,
and we ended up getting 1.2% FNMR (It should be straight-
forward in our context that by “matching” or “non-matching”
in the FMR and FNMR tests, we mean that the original bio-

metric sample x used in the KeyTPLGen algorithm is recov-
ered or not in the KeyRelease algorithm.). These are rather
promising results. While experiments with larger and “live-
ly captured” datasets would be more convincing, this result
represents a basic indication on the feasibility of biometric
wrapped credentials.
For computation performance, in order not to compound
the experimental results we did not take into consideration
the communications, and client program and server program
were run in isolation. As to client App’s performance, we
measured separately, the time it takes to unwrap a biomet-
ric wrapped credential and the time to complete the client
side computation of the anonymous authentication proto-
col: on average the former is 1.6 seconds and the latter 2.58
seconds. The server application takes about 120 millisec-
onds to complete the server side computation of the anony-
mous authentication protocol, averaging over 100 execution-
s. These results suggest that biometric wrapped credentials
have demonstrated practically acceptable performance even
upon mobile devices.
6. CONCLUSIONS
Our main contributions are two-fold in this work. First,
we made an improvement to a state-of-the-art anonymous
password authentication scheme (under password wrapped
credential) proposed in ACSAC’10, which is being standard-
ized. The resulting scheme is neater, more eﬃcient and de-
ployment friendly. Second, we extended the concept of pass-
word wrapped credential to biometric wrapped credential,
in a bid to achieve realistic anonymous biometric authenti-
cation. As expected, biometric wrapped credentials helped
get over the linear server-side computation bound inherent
in the typical setting of biometric authentication. We imple-
mented and tested the proposed anonymous biometric au-
thentication protocol, and the experimental results demon-
strated the feasibility of anonymous biometric authentica-
tion under the auspices of biometric wrapped credentials.
