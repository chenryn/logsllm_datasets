trained incorporating this training objective alongside masked
token predition. During training, LogFiT’s loss function was
modified to include the centroid distance, which is the distance
of each log paragraph’s [CLS] vector from the centroid vector
computed from the previous epoch. The intuition behind this isthat the centroid distance loss will force the [CLS] vectors of
all normal samples to be close to each other. The centroid is the
mean of the CV vectors of all normal log sentences. During the
centroid distance minimisation process, the q-quantile centroid
distance is calculated, where q is set to a value between 0.65
