Abstract
Brain computer interfaces (BCI) are becoming in-
creasingly popular in the gaming and entertainment in-
dustries. Consumer-grade BCI devices are available for
a few hundred dollars and are used in a variety of appli-
cations, such as video games, hands-free keyboards, or as
an assistant in relaxation training. There are application
stores similar to the ones used for smart phones, where
application developers have access to an API to collect
data from the BCI devices.
The security risks involved in using consumer-grade
BCI devices have never been studied and the impact of
malicious software with access to the device is unex-
plored. We take a ﬁrst step in studying the security impli-
cations of such devices and demonstrate that this upcom-
ing technology could be turned against users to reveal
their private and secret information. We use inexpensive
electroencephalography (EEG) based BCI devices to test
the feasibility of simple, yet effective, attacks. The cap-
tured EEG signal could reveal the user’s private informa-
tion about, e.g., bank cards, PIN numbers, area of living,
the knowledge of the known persons. This is the ﬁrst
attempt to study the security implications of consumer-
grade BCI devices. We show that the entropy of the pri-
vate information is decreased on the average by approx-
imately 15 % - 40 % compared to random guessing at-
tacks.

a non-
muscular communication between a user and an exter-
nal device by measuring the brain’s activities. In the last
decades, BCIs have been primarily applied in the med-
ical domain with the goal to increase the quality of life
of patients with severe neuromuscular disorders. Most
BCIs are based on electroencephalography (EEG) as it
provides a non-invasive method for recording the elec-
trical ﬁelds directly produced by neuronal synaptic ac-
tivity. The EEG signal is recorded from scalp electrodes
by a differential ampliﬁer in order to increase the Signal-
to-Noise Ratio of the electrical signal that is attenuated
by the skull. This signal is continuously sampled (typ-
ically 128 Hz - 512 Hz) to provide a high temporal res-
olution, making EEG an ideal method for capturing the
rapid, millisecond-scale dynamics of brain information
processing with a simple setup.
Particular patterns of brain waves have been found to
differentiate neurocognitive states and to offer a rich fea-
ture space for studying neurological processes of both
disabled and healthy users.
For example, EEG has
not only been used for neurofeedback therapy in atten-
tion deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [20], epilepsy
monitoring [6], and sleep disorders [28], but also to study
underlying processes of skilled performance in sports
and changes in vigilance [14, 31], in estimating alertness
and drowsiness in drivers [22] and the mental workload
of air-trafﬁc control operators [39].
Besides medical applications, BCI devices are becom-
ing increasingly popular in the entertainment and gaming
industries. The ability to capture a user’s cognitive activ-
ities enables the development of more adaptive games
responsive to the user’s affective states, such as satis-
faction, boredom, frustration, confusion, and helps to
improve the gaming experience [26]. A similar trend
can be seen in popular gaming consoles such as Mi-
crosoft’s Xbox 360, Nintendo’s Wii, or Sony’s Playsta-
tion3, which already include different sensors to in-
fer user’s behavioral and physiological states through
pressure, heartbeat, facial and voice recognition, gaze-
tracking, and motion.
In the last couple of years, several EEG-based gam-
ing devices have made their way onto the market and be-
came available to the general public. Companies such
as Emotiv Systems [5] and NeuroSky [25] are offering
low-cost EEG-based BCI devices (e.g., see Figure 1) and
software development kits to support the expansion of

tools and games available from their application mar-
kets. Currently, there are more than 100 available appli-
cations ranging from accessibility tools, such as a mind-
controlled keyboard and mouse and hands-free arcade
games, to so-called serious games, i.e., games with a pur-
pose other than pure entertainment, such as attention and
memory training games. For example, in [2], the authors
used the Emotiv BCI device to implement a hands-free
brain-to-mobile phone dialing application.
Marketing is another ﬁeld that has shown increas-
ing interest in commercial applications of BCI devices.
In 2008, The Nielsen Company (a leading market re-
search company) acquired NeuroFocus, a company spe-
cialized in neuroscience research, and it has recently de-
veloped an EEG-based BCI device called Mynd such that
“...market researchers will be able to capture the highest
quality data on consumers’ deep subconscious responses
in real time wirelessly, revolutionizing mobile in-market
research and media consumption at home.”1
In light of the progress of this technology, we be-
lieve that the trend in using EEG-based BCI devices for
non-medical applications, in particular gaming, enter-
tainment, and marketing, will continue. Given that this
technology provides information on our cognitive pro-

cessing and allows inferences to be made with regard
to our intentions, conscious and unconscious interests,
or emotional responses, we are concerned with its secu-
rity and privacy aspects. More speciﬁcally, we are in-
terested in understanding how easily this technology can
be turned against its users to reveal their private infor-
mation, that is, information they would not knowingly or
willingly share. In particular, we investigate how third-
party EEG applications could infer private information
about the users, by manipulating the visual stimuli pre-
sented on screen and by analyzing the corresponding re-
sponses in the EEG signal.
1.1 Contributions
To justify how crucial the security and privacy concerns
of this upcoming technology are, we provide some con-
crete answers in terms of demonstrating practical at-
tacks using existing low-cost BCI devices. More speciﬁ-
cally, the main contributions of this paper are:
• We explore, for the ﬁrst time, EEG gaming devices
as a potential attack vector to infer secret and pri-
vate information about their users. This attack vec-
tor is entirely unexplored and qualitatively different
from previously explored side-channels. This calls
for research to analyze their potential to leak private
information before these devices gain widespread
adoption.
• We design and implement BCI experiments that
show the possibility of attacks to reveal a user’s pri-
vate and secret information. The experiments are
implemented and tested using a Emotiv EPOC BCI
device. Since 2009, this consumer-grade device has
been available on the market for the entertainment
and gaming purposes.
• In a systematic user study, we analyze the feasibility
of these attacks and show that they are able to reveal
information about the user’s month of birth, area of
living, knowledge of persons known to the user, PIN
numbers, name of the user’s bank, and the user’s
preferred bank card.
2 A Brief Introduction to P300 Event-
Related Potentials
In this section, we provide a brief introduction to the
speciﬁcs of the EEG signal that are required to under-
stand the rationale behind this work.
An important neurophysiological phenomenon used in
studies of EEG signals is the Event-Related Potential
(ERP). An ERP is detected as a pattern of voltage change
after a certain auditory or visual stimulus is presented to
a subject. Every ERP is time-locked to the stimulus, i.e.,
the time frame at which an EEG voltage change is ex-
pected to occur is known given the timing of the stimuli.
The most prominent ERP component which is sen-
sitive to complex cognitive processing is the P300, so-
called because it can be detected as an amplitude peak
in the EEG signal at ≈ 300 ms after the stimulus (see
Figure 3). The complexity of the stimulus and individ-
ual differences contribute to the variability of the ampli-
tude and latency (e.g., the latency varies between 250 -
500 ms), yet the P300 is considered to be a fundamental
physiological component and is reliably measured (for
a recent overview of the P300 from a neuroscience per-
spective, please see, e.g., [27]). While there are two sub-
components of the P300, called P3a and P3b, both are
related to complex cognitive processing, such as recog-
nition and classiﬁcation of external stimuli. In this paper,
we take advantage of the subcomponent P3b of the P300,
and for the sake of simplicity we will refer to it as the
P300, which is also a convention in neuroscience.
The P300 is elicited when subjects discriminate be-
tween task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimuli using a
so-called “oddball paradigm” (for more information, see,
e.g., [16]). During an oddball task the number of task-
relevant stimuli (called target stimuli) is less frequent
than the number of task-irrelevant stimuli (called non-
target). Probably the most well-known application of the
P300 in an oddball task is the P300-Speller. In this ap-
plication the alphanumeric characters are arranged in a
matrix where rows and columns ﬂash on the screen in
a rapid succession. The target stimulus is the charac-
ter that a subject desires to spell and the P300 is evoked
each time the target letter is ﬂashed due to a neuronal
response triggered by increased attention of recognition.
This application has been used to establish a communi-
cation channel for patients with locked-in syndrome or
with severe neurodegenerative disorders.
Figure 3: The P300 ERP elicited as a brain response to
a target stimuli (in this experiment the non-target stimuli
were pictures of unknown faces, while the target stimuli
was the picture showing President Obama).
The P300 is seen in response to target stimuli deﬁned
by the task, but it has also been observed to be elicited
during stimuli that are personally meaningful to partic-
ipants. For example, if a random sequence of personal
names is presented to a subject, the P300 will be the
largest during the presentation of the subject’s own name
[32]. Likewise, it has been shown that the P300 discrim-
inates familiar from unfamiliar faces within randomly
presented sequences [24].
3 BCI Attacks: Threat Model and
Assumptions
In this section, we explore a number of possible scenar-
ios in which consumer EEG devices could be abused to
capture sensitive or private information from users. Cur-
rently, both Emotiv and NeuroSky have “App Stores”
where the users can download a wide variety of appli-
cations. Similarly to application stores for smart phones,
the applications are developed by third parties that rely
on a common API to access the devices. In the case of
the EEG devices, this API provides unrestricted access to
the raw EEG signal. Furthermore, such applications have
complete control over the stimuli that can be presented to
the users.
In this scenario, the attacker is a malicious third-party
developer of applications that are using EEG-based BCI
devices. Its goal is to learn as much information as pos-
sible about the user. Hence, we are neither assuming any
malware running on the machine of the victim nor a tam-
pered device, just “brain spyware”, i.e., a software in-
tentionally designed to detect private information. Our
attacker model cannot access more computer resources
than any third party application for the respective BCI
device. The attacker can read the EEG signal from the

screen. Therefore, the attacker can speciﬁcally design
the videos and images shown to the user to maximize the
amount of information leaked while trying to conceal the
attacks.
The type of information that could be discovered by
such an attack is only bound by the quality of the signal
coming from the EEG device and the techniques used
to extract the signal. We note that all involved parties
(users of BCI devices, their developers, and also attack-
ers) share the same objective:
to maximize the signal
quality in order to best perform their task. Hence, it is
expected that the signal and the measurement processes
will improve and, as a result, facilitate the attacks.
In this work we will focus on categorization tasks, in
which the mind of the user is probed to detect whether
certain stimuli (faces, banks, locations) are familiar to or
relevant for the user. However, we note that in the future
such attack could be extended to include other sensitive
information. For instance, EEG devices have been used,
under optimized lab conditions, to study prejudices, sex-
ual orientation, religious beliefs [18], and deviant sexual
interests [38, 10].
At the moment, low-cost devices are still very noisy
and need a calibration phase to work properly (three min-
utes in our experiments). However, we note that the at-
tacker could ﬁnd a natural situation in which to expose
the user to target stimuli to extract information and thus
gather enough data to succeed in an unnoticed way. Also,
such a calibration phase can be concealed in the normal
training phase that EEG applications require for proper
functioning and that the user is willing to support. More-
over, we expect that BCI devices will become increas-
ingly robust and accurate in the future, resolving many
current technical problems.
The experiments presented in this study are meant to
show feasibility in favorable conditions. The subjects
