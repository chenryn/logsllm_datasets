User: I want to execute a on-demand ETL job, using AWS architecture.
This ETL process is going to run daily, and I don't want to pay for a EC2 instance all the time. This ETL job can be written in python, for example.
I know that in EMR, I can build my cluster on-demand and execute a hadoop job.
What is the best architecture to run a simple on-demand ETL job?
Assistant: Now you can put your script on AWS Lambda for ETL. It supports scheduler and Trigger on other AWS components. It is on-demand and will charge you only when the Lambda function got executed.
