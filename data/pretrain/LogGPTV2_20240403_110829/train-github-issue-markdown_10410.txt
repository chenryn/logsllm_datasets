 **Context:**
  * Playwright Version: 
    * NuGet: 1.17.3 (installed in the project)
    * microsoft.playwright.cli: 1.2.2 (from `dotnet tool list -g`)
    * Installed on machine: 1.17.1 (`playwright -V`)
  * Operating System: Windows
  * .NET version: .NET 6
  * Browser: All
**Describe the bug**
When `PWDEBUG` is set to 0, Playwright Inspector appears when tests are ran
[incorrect behaviour, I believe].
When set to an empty string (PowerShell: `$env:PWDEBUG=''`, then Inspector is
not running [correct behaviour].
Solution:
  * Disable running Inspector when `PWDEBUG` environment variable is set to 0.
  * Update documentation.
