User: Please analyze common database attack types and corresponding defense measures
Assistant: The common types of database attacks and corresponding defense measures are as follows: 1. SQL injection attack The attacker uses the SQL injection attack program to insert malicious SQL code into the input field of the web application, so that the malicious code is executed by the database server. The following methods can be used to defend against SQL injection attacks: - Filter and escape data input; - Use parameterized queries to avoid SQL splicing; - Limit the permissions of database users, and only grant the minimum permissions to execute stored procedures and SQL statements; - Do not write SQL and other statements into the HTML code of the web page in plain text. 2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) Attackers inject malicious scripts into web applications, and these malicious scripts are executed when users visit the page. Ways to prevent XSS attacks include: - Escaping on input and output; - Limiting input length, type, format; - Code review and vulnerability scanning of applications; - Setting HTTP headers to reduce cross-site scripting efforts. 3. Database brute force cracking Infiltrators obtain database user names and passwords through brute force cracking or social engineering attacks, and then log in to the database for operations. Defensive measures include: - using complex passwords; - implementing account lockout/self-defense mechanisms; - logging the login process into a centralized security information and event management system (SIEM) for monitoring and analysis; - restricting unnecessary database access. 4. Database denial of service attack (DoS) The attacker exploits a vulnerability or a high-load attack to make the server software or operating system unusable. Methods to prevent database DoS attacks mainly include: - Limiting the number of network connections; - Using load balancers; - Regularly updating server software to address known vulnerabilities; ask. In short, to protect the security of the database, it is necessary to strengthen measures from many aspects, including strengthening access control, auditing and monitoring, and encryption protection mechanisms.
