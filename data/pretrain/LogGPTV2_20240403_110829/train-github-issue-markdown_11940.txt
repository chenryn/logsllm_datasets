Despite having turned on "Move newly created windows to their last know zone",
ever since 0.19 and still in 0.19.1 when a new PDF document opens, fancy zones
will not snap the pdf to the same zone. When the new document is opened in a
new tab within Acrobat reader, Acrobat moves to a new location and shrinks to
what I assume is Acrobat's default positioning / size for new documents.  
Other details:
  * Will snap to last known zone on the same monitor of the Windows Explorer window where the document is being opened, but only when opening a whole new instance of Acrobat. When snapping to the zone in this case, it quickly flashes in the other on the before moving to the new second monitor and zone.
  * If Acrobat is open and the new document is opened in a new tab, it relocates Acrobat to the window, size and location that I can only guess is Acrobat's default setting, even if that is on a different monitor.
  * Issue persists if Acrobat settings changed to open each document in a new window (turn off tabs). The first instance opens in the last known zone in the same monitor as Window Explorer. The second and subsequent instances opens in the same monitor, but with the smaller size and location as described above (not snapped to the zone).
  * Zone behavior settings attached.
