To execute `cd` and `ls` commands within the Python debugger (pdb), you can use the `os` module. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. First, import the `os` module:
   ```python
   (Pdb) import os
   ```

2. To list the contents of a directory, use `os.system("ls")`:
   ```python
   (Pdb) os.system("ls")
   ```

3. If you want to spawn a subshell, which allows you to run multiple shell commands, you can use `os.system("sh")`:
   ```python
   (Pdb) os.system("sh")
   ```
   Exiting the subshell will return you to the pdb prompt.

4. Note that using `os.system("cd dir")` will not change the current working directory (cwd) of the Python process. Instead, use `os.chdir("/path/to/targetdir")` to change the cwd:
   ```python
   (Pdb) os.chdir("/path/to/targetdir")
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to execute the desired commands within the Python debugger.
