User: I want to run cd and ls in python debugger. I try to use !ls but I get

*** NameError: name 'ls' is not defined
Assistant: Simply use the "os" module and you will able to easily execute any os command from within pdb.
Start with:
(Pdb) import os
And then:
(Pdb) os.system("ls")
or even 
(Pdb) os.system("sh")
the latest simply spawns a subshell. Exiting from  it returns back to debugger.
Note: the "cd" command will have no effect when used as os.system("cd dir") since it will not change the cwd of the python process. Use os.chdir("/path/to/targetdir") for that.
