User: On taskqueue in gae. 
For example, I have task A, B.
How to ensure that task B starts right after task A finishes.
There could be other tasks, like C, to fix this problem.
Also, 'right after' could be loose to 'after'.
How about a dedicate queue with max_current_requests set to 1?
Assistant: It seems impossible to guarantee that B will be next.
