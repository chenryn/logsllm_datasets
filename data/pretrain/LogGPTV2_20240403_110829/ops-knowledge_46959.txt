Question: An auditor is reviewing a web application's source code and notices that the PHP authentication code is using the 'unserialize()' function to parse user-supplied data, which is then used in a loose comparison for authentication. Which of the following code snippets would not prevent an authentication bypass in this scenario?
"A": "Checking if 'autologinid' is a boolean and denying access if it is.",
"B": "Replacing loose comparison with strict comparison using '===' operator.",
"C": "Using a custom function to validate 'sessiondata' elements before using them.",
"D": "Ensuring that 'autologinid' matches the user's password hash using an MD5 comparison."
Answer: D
