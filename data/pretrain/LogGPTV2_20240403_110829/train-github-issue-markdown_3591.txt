**Feature Request: Synchronized Scrolling for Markdown and Preview Panes**

When working with a markdown file in split panes—one pane displaying the raw markdown and the other showing the HTML preview—it would be highly beneficial to have the two panes stay in sync as I scroll through either one. For example, if I scroll down in the raw markdown pane, the preview pane should automatically scroll down to the corresponding section, ensuring that the markdown and its preview remain aligned.

This feature is currently available in MarkdownPad, my previous markdown editor, and I believe it would greatly enhance the user experience in Visual Studio Code as well.

Thank you for considering this request.
