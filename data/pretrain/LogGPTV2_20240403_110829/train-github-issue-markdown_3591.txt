This is more of a feature request...
When viewing a markdown file in split panes with one side being the raw
markdown and the other being the HTML preview, I'd like to be able to have the
two panes stay in sync as I scroll one or the other. For example, if I scroll
down in the raw pane, I'd like the preview pane to scroll down as well so the
markdown and preview stay in sync with each other. This is a feature found in
MarkdownPad, my current/previous markdown editor, that I'd like to see in VS
Code as well.
Thanks!
