### Stopping a Default Detail Trace

- **Using the Command Line:**
  ```plaintext
  CALL PGM(QMQM/ENDMQTRC)
  ```

- **Using Qshell:**
  ```plaintext
  /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/ENDMQTRC.PGM
  ```

**Note:** Executing `endmqtrc` without parameters has the same effect as using `endmqtrc -e`. The `-e` parameter cannot be used in conjunction with the `-m`, `-i`, or `-p` parameters.

### Stopping a Trace of Queue Manager QMA

- **Using the Command Line:**
  ```plaintext
  CALL PGM(QMQM/ENDMQTRC) PARM('-m' 'QMA')
  ```

- **Using Qshell:**
  ```plaintext
  /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/ENDMQTRC.PGM -m QMA
  ```

### Stopping a Trace of Jobs Named AMQSPUT

- **Using the Command Line:**
  ```plaintext
  CALL PGM(QMQM/ENDMQTRC) PARM('-p' 'AMQSPUT')
  ```

- **Using Qshell:**
  ```plaintext
  /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/ENDMQTRC.PGM -p AMQSPUT
  ```

### Stopping an Early Trace

- **Using the Command Line:**
  ```plaintext
  CALL PGM(QMQM/ENDMQTRC) PARM('-e')
  ```

- **Using Qshell:**
  ```plaintext
  /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/ENDMQTRC.PGM -e
  ```

### Formatting Binary Trace Files

The trace files generated by IBM MQ are binary and must be formatted before they can be read. You can either send the binary traces to IBM or format them at the Qshell when your system is not under heavy load. If you format the traces yourself, delete the binary trace files before sending them to IBM.

- **Using the Command Line to Delete Binary Trace Files:**
  ```plaintext
  RMVLNK OBJLNK('/QIBM/UserData/mqm/trace/AMQ*.?.TR?')
  ```

- **Using Qshell to Display and Delete Formatted Trace Files:**
  ```plaintext
  cd /QIBM/UserData/mqm/trace
  /QSYS.LIB/QMQM.LIB/DSPMQTRC.PGM AMQ*.TR?
  rm -f AMQ*.?.TR?
  ```

### Collecting Traces and Troubleshooting Information

You can collect the data either automatically or manually:

- **Automatically Using `runmqras`:**
  ```plaintext
  /QIBM/ProdData/mqm/bin/runmqras -section trace,defs,cluster -caseno TS001234567 -qmlist QMA
  ```

- **Manually:**
  Refer to “Collecting troubleshooting information manually” on page 306.

### Sending Traces and Troubleshooting Information to IBM

For more information, see “Sending troubleshooting information to IBM” on page 353.

### Cleaning Up the Trace Directory

- **Using the Command Line:**
  ```plaintext
  RMVLNK OBJLNK('/QIBM/UserData/mqm/trace/AMQ*.*')
  ```

- **Using Qshell:**
  ```plaintext
  cd /QIBM/UserData/mqm/trace
  rm -f AMQ*.*
  ```

### Tracing on Windows

On Windows, you can use the `strmqtrc` and `endmqtrc` commands to start and end tracing. You can also use IBM MQ Explorer to start and end tracing.

#### Before You Begin

To format or view a trace file, you must be either the creator of the trace file or a member of the `mqm` group.

#### About This Task

Traces can capture the root cause of many IBM MQ problems. It is important to limit how long tracing is active to avoid affecting performance or generating excessively large trace files.

#### Controlling the Trace Facility on Windows

- **Starting a Trace:**
  ```plaintext
  strmqtrc -t comms
  strmqtrc -m QMA
  strmqtrc -m QMB -d 0
  strmqtrc -t api -p amqsput -d all
  strmqtrc -e -t all -t detail -l 100
  ```

- **Stopping a Trace:**
  ```plaintext
  endmqtrc -a
  endmqtrc -m QMA
  endmqtrc -p amqsput
  ```

- **Checking Trace Status:**
  ```plaintext
  strmqtrc -s
  ```

#### Collecting and Sending Traces

- **Using `runmqras` to Collect Data:**
  ```plaintext
  /QIBM/ProdData/mqm/bin/runmqras -section trace,defs,cluster -caseno TS001234567 -qmlist QMA
  ```

- **Sending Traces to IBM:**
  For more information, see “Sending troubleshooting information to IBM” on page 353.

- **Cleaning Up the Trace Directory:**
  ```plaintext
  C:\> CD "%MQ_DATA_PATH%\trace"
  C:\ProgramData\IBM\MQ\trace> DEL AMQ*.TRC AMQ*.TRS
  ```

### Tracing on z/OS

There are different trace options available for problem determination with IBM MQ on z/OS. Use this topic to understand the different options and how to control trace.

#### Available Trace Facilities

- **User Parameter (API) Trace**
- **IBM Internal Trace (for support center)**
- **Channel Initiator Trace**
- **Line Trace**

#### Controlling the GTF and IBM MQ Trace

- **Controlling the GTF:**
  - Ensure the GTF is started correctly, specifying EIDs 5E9, 5EA, and 5EE on the USRP option.
  - Enter the `START TRACE(GLOBAL)` command with the relevant classes specified.

- **Other Trace Options:**
  - Channel initiator trace
  - Line trace
  - CICS adapter trace
  - System SSL trace

For more information, refer to the following topics:
- **Controlling the GTF for Your z/OS System**
- **Controlling the IBM MQ Trace for Each Queue Manager Subsystem**
- **Formatting and Identifying the Control Block Information on z/OS** (page 398)
- **Interpreting the Trace Information on z/OS** (page 399)

If trace data is not produced, check the following:
- Was the GTF started correctly, specifying the required EIDs?
- Was the `START TRACE(GLOBAL)` command entered correctly, and were the relevant classes specified?
