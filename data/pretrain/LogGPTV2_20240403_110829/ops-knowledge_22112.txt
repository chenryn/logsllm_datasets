User:  Please explain the principles and advantages of RESTful API, and provide an example to illustrate how to design an interface that conforms to the RESTful API standard.
Assistant: RESTful API is an API described based on REST architecture, which uses HTTP request methods to call and query data. Its basic principle is to abstract each resource into a Web Service exposed through URI, and perform CRUD (add, delete, modify, check) operations on it through HTTP requests, so as to realize data transmission. The advantages of RESTful API are as follows: 1. Support multiple formats: RESTful API supports multiple data formats, such as XML, JSON, and multiple HTTP methods, such as GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. 2. Good readability: The URI design of the RESTful API is semantic, easy to understand and use. 3. Cacheable: The RESTful API is based on the HTTP protocol, so the caching mechanism of the HTTP protocol can be used. 4. Easy to expand and upgrade: RESTful API can be expanded and upgraded by adding methods, adding resources and version management. Design an interface that conforms to the RESTful API standard: Suppose there is a library management system that needs to provide a RESTful API to perform CRUD operations on library resources. The following is an example to demonstrate how to design an interface that conforms to the RESTful API standard: 1. Get a list of books: Request method: GET Request URL: /books Response format: JSON Response status code: 200 2. Get a specific book: Request method: GET request URL: /books/123 Response format: JSON Response status code: 200 3. Add book: Request method: POST Request URL: /books Request parameters: title, author, ISBN code Response status code: 201 4. Update book: Request Method: PUT Request URL: /books/123 Request Parameters: Book Title, Author, ISBN Code Response Status Code: 204 5. Delete Book: Request Method: DELETE Request URL: /books/123 Response Status Code: 204
