Specifies whether extended APIC functionality 
should be used if the chipset supports it. 
Disabled is equivalent to setting 
uselegacyapicmode, whereas Enabled forces 
ACPI functionality on even if errata are detected. 
Default uses the chipset’s reported capabilities 
(unless errata are present).

Used while testing support for XSAVE on 
modern Intel processors; allows for faking that 
certain processor features are present when, in 
fact, they are not. This helps increase the size of 
the CONTEXT structure and confirms that 
applications work correctly with extended 
features that might appear in the future. No 
actual extra functionality will be present, 
however.
