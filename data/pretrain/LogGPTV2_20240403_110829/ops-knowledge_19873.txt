Regular backup: Back up data regularly to ensure that data will not be lost in the event of an attack or system failure. 4. Security audit: record all database operations, including login, query and modification, etc., so as to track problems and ensure security. 5. Updates and patches: timely installation of database software patches and updates to fix known security vulnerabilities and defects. 6. Monitoring and detection: Use security monitoring tools to timely alert and monitor abnormal database access to avoid data leakage and attacks. 7. Physical Security: Control physical access to database servers and take steps to avoid data loss and theft. 8. Employee education: Strengthen employee training and awareness education, remind them to pay attention to the security of the database, and avoid accidental disclosure of important information. In short, to protect the database security needs comprehensive consideration of technical and management factors.
