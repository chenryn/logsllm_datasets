### Censorship Metric in Time Series Analysis

We observe that the reduction in volatility, attributed to rogue vantage points, enhances the clarity of the signal during nationwide censorship events. Applying our anomaly detection techniques to the raw censorship metric consistently yields a lower number of useful events. For instance, the Bitmap detection technique, when applied to the raw censorship metric at a threshold of 3.1, identifies only 5 censorship events, compared to 7 when applied to the smoothed metric (Table 2).

**Figure 10:** Standard deviation in raw and smoothed censorship metrics. The smoothed metric exhibits significantly less volatility compared to the raw censorship metric. IP censorship shows similar results but is not displayed here due to scale variations.

### A.3 Detailed Comparison

Table 3 provides a detailed comparison between Censored Planet (March 2020) and other censorship measurement platforms: ICLab (September 2018), OONI’s web connectivity dataset (March 2020), and individual remote measurement techniques (March 2020) (§6.2). Censored Planet not only has broader coverage in terms of the total number of countries but also includes vantage points in all "Not Free" countries and all but one "Partly Free" country, as per the Freedom on the Net 2019 report. Additionally, Censored Planet offers more extensive coverage in terms of the raw number of ASes.

### B. APPENDIX: RESULTS

In this appendix, we document results on measuring the blocking of Tor Bridges and provide additional censorship case studies beyond those in §7.1. We also present some general findings.

#### B.1 Blocking of Tor Bridges

At the request of Tor, we have been conducting custom rapid focus measurements to test IP reachability to Tor default bridges since January 2020. These default bridges are hardcoded into the Tor browser and serve as a valuable indicator of Tor censorship. Using a custom extension to Augur, we tested reachability to 12 Tor bridges [105]. Four of these bridges were offline during our measurement period. The remaining eight Tor bridges were blocked in China across all our measurements [38]. Tor bridges are also aggressively blocked in Tanzania (seven bridges blocked), Venezuela (five bridges blocked), and Ukraine (five bridges blocked). Our ongoing testing of reachability to Tor IPs will help identify Tor blocking patterns and trends in different countries.

#### B.2 Other Censorship Case Studies

In this section, we provide details on additional key censorship events described in Table 1.

**B.2.1 Blocking of Social Media in Zimbabwe**

In January 2019, protests erupted in Zimbabwe in response to skyrocketing fuel prices [17]. During the third week of January 2019, 12 people were reportedly killed, and many more protesters were wounded or arrested by the police. In response to the protests, the government resorted to censorship of social media and, in some cases, an entire Internet shutdown [117]. According to OONI, five social media websites (Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube) were intermittently blocked by multiple ISPs between January 14th and January 21st, 2019, primarily through HTTP connection blocking.

Censored Planet also detected a significant increase in the censorship of domains belonging to the social networking category. Figure 11 illustrates the value of Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5) over time for the social networking category in Zimbabwe. A large increase in HTTP(S) blocking in the week of January 20 indicates the use of the SNI field for blocking specific domains. In addition to the five social media domains discovered by OONI, Censored Planet found eight other domains being blocked during this period: linkedin.com, weibo.com, vk.com, myspace.com, foursquare.com, twimg.com, ok.ru, and www.pinterest.com. These additional findings highlight the importance of testing domains from more vantage points and demonstrate the complementary insights Censored Planet can provide to existing platforms.

Although Zimbabwe’s High Court ruled on January 21st, 2019, that Internet blackouts were illegal [122], we observed later instances of intermittent blocking of social media websites (Figure 11) and high levels of censorship in general. In late 2019, we observed extremely aggressive but intermittent DNS blocking of Facebook and Instagram by AS 328235 (Zimbabwe Internet Exchange). In February and March 2020, our Quack Echo measurements detected the blocking of 17 Social Networking websites, including Twitter, Google, and Instagram, in AS 37184 (Powertel Communications). We did not have vantage points in AS 37184 before February 2020. Our analysis of Zimbabwe’s continued blocking of social media domains further underscores the power of longitudinal data collection and processing by Censored Planet.

**B.2.2 Blocking of News Media in Japan**

In June 2019, Japan hosted the G20 Conference for the first time [21]. The G20 conference is a forum where 19 countries and the EU meet to discuss the global economy and set financial regulations. Japan is noted by Freedom House as a free country, which has led many censorship studies to overlook measurements in Japan. However, ICLab noticed high rates of blocking of domains in the news and media category in Japan but considered it a possible false positive or localized observation [7].

During the G20 period, we observed increased blocking of domains in the news media and E-commerce categories in Japan. DNS blocking was observed in both categories, while Echo blocking was seen to a lesser extent in the E-commerce category. The domains being blocked included popular news domains such as online.wsj.com and washingtonpost.com under the news media category and kickstarter.com and marketwatch.com under the E-commerce category. We observed DNS blocking in 47 ASes (out of 51) during this week, indicating that the blocking was widespread and not localized. The highest increase in blocking was in AS 45688 (UT-NSRG). This finding demonstrates that Censored Planet’s large-scale and robust data processing capabilities can uncover censorship events in countries generally regarded as free.

#### B.3 General Results

Table 4 shows the categories of domains and their overall average Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5). Anonymization tools top the list, suggesting that censors are actively trying to prevent users from accessing content through any means necessary. This provides further motivation for testing reachability to circumvention systems using Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities. Websites related to foreign military and pornography follow.

Table 5 showcases the top 5 countries and the top 3 categories in each country with the highest Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5) for each censorship method measured by Censored Planet. Our results align with observations from other censorship measurement platforms [7, 104], but some unexpected countries (Vatican City, Oman) appear on the list due to the improved scale of Censored Planet. China, Iran, and Turkmenistan still dominate the list, with pornography and anonymization tools being highly blocked in all these countries.

**Table 4: Censorship of Different Categories**

| Category | Cens(Smooth) |

| Foreign relations and military | 1.71 |
| Pornography | 1.67 |
| Search Engines | 1.66 |
| History, arts, and literature | 1.36 |
| Media sharing | 1.2 |
