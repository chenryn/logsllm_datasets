censorship metric in each of our different time series. We also ob-
serve that this reduction in volatility caused by rogue vantage points
helps in obtaining a more clear signal when nationwide censorship
events do occur. Applying our anomaly detection techniques on the
raw censorship metric consistently finds lower number of useful

ship metrics–The smoothed metric is much less volatile compared
to the raw censorship metric. IP censorship has similar results, but
is not shown here due to high variation in scale.
events. For example, the Bitmap detection technique applied to the
raw censorship metric at threshold 3.1 only identifies 5 censorship
events (compared to the 7 in Table 2 when applied to the smoothed
metric).
A.3 Detailed Comparison
Table 3 provides more detail on our comparison of Censored Planet
(03/2020) with ICLab (09/2018), OONI’s web connectivity dataset
(03/2020) and the individual remote measurement techniques (03/2020)
(§6.2). As seen from the table, not only does Censored Planet have
more coverage in terms of total number of countries, it also has
vantage points in all the countries in the “Not Free” category and
all but one in the “Partly Free” category of the Freedom on the Net
2019 report. Censored Planet also has more coverage in terms of
raw number of ASes.
B APPENDIX: RESULTS
In this Appendix, we document results on measuring the blocking
of Tor Bridges and describe some censorship case studies other
than the ones in §7.1. We also describe some general results.
B.1 Blocking of Tor Bridges
Upon request from Tor, we have been running custom rapid focus
measurements testing IP reachability to Tor default bridges since
January 2020. The default Tor bridges are hardcoded into the Tor
browser and act as a valuable indicator of Tor censorship. Using
a custom extension to Augur that allows testing connections on
different TCP ports, we tested reachability to 12 Tor bridges [105].
Four of these bridges were offline during the period of our measure-
ments. The remaining eight Tor bridges are blocked in China in
all of our measurements [38]. Tor bridges are also blocked aggres-
sively in Tanzania (seven bridges blocked), Venezuela (five bridges
blocked) and Ukraine (five bridges blocked). Our continued testing
of reachability to Tor IPs will help discover Tor blocking patterns
and trends in different countries.
B.2 Other Censorship Case Studies
In this section, we provide details on a few more key censorship
events described in Table 1.

Figure 11: Social Networking Censorship in Zimbabwe– Cen-
sored Planet observed an increase in HTTP(S) blocking of So-
cial Networking domains in Zimbabwe in January 2019. Censored
Planet also detected blocking of popular Social Networking domains
in late 2019 and 2020 using DNS and Echo measurements.
B.2.1 Blocking of Social Media in Zimbabwe. In January 2019,
protests erupted in Zimbabwe in response to skyrocketing fuel
prices [17]. During the third week of January 2019, 12 people were
reportedly killed and many more protesters were wounded or ar-
rested by the police. In response to the protests, the government
resorted to censorship of social media, and an entire Internet shut-
down in some cases [117]. As reported by OONI, five social media
websites (Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube)
were intermittently blocked by multiple ISPs between January 14th
and January 21st 2019. The report suggests blocking of HTTP con-
nections to these websites.
Censored Planet also detects a large increase in censorship of
domains belonging to the social networking category. Figure 11
shows the value of Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5) over time for the so-
cial networking category in Zimbabwe. A large increase in HTTP(S)
blocking in the week of January 20 indicates the use of the SNI field
for blocking specific domains. In addition to the five social media
domains discovered to be blocked by OONI, Censored Planet found
eight other domains being blocked during this period - linkedin.com,
weibo.com, vk.com, myspace.com, foursquare.com, twimg.com,
ok.ru and www.pinterest.com. These additional findings demon-
strate the importance of testing domains on more vantage points, and
indicates the complementary insights Censored Planet can provide to
existing platforms.
Although Zimbabwe’s High Court ruled on January 21st 2019
that Internet blackouts were illegal [122], we observed later in-
stances of intermittent blocking of social media websites (Figure 11)
and high censorship in general. In late 2019, we observed extremely
aggressive but intermittent DNS blocking of Facebook and Insta-
gram by AS 328235 (Zimbabwe Internet Exchange). In February and
March 2020, our Quack Echo measurements observed the blocking
of 17 Social Networking websites, including Twitter, Google, and
Instagram in AS 37184 (Powertel Communications). We did not
have vantage points in AS 37184 before February 2020. Our analysis
of Zimbabwe’s continued blocking of social media domains further
illustrates the power of the longitudinal data collection and processing
of Censored Planet.
B.2.2 Blocking of News Media in Japan. In June 2019, Japan hosted
the G20 Conference for the first time [21]. The G20 conference is
a forum where 19 countries and the EU meet to discuss the global
economy and set financial regulations. Japan is noted by Freedom
House to be a free country, which has resulted in many censorship
studies overlooking measurements in Japan. In fact, ICLab noticed
high rates of blocking of domains in the news and media category
in Japan, but considered it as a possible false positive or localized
observation since Japan is generally thought of as a free country [7].
During the G20 period, we observed increased blocking of do-
mains in the news media and E-commerce category in Japan. DNS
blocking was observed in both categories while Echo blocking was
seen in the E-commerce category to a smaller extent. The domains
being blocked during this time period included popular news do-
mains such as online.wsj.com and washingtonpost.com under the
news media category and kickstarter.com and marketwatch.com
under the E-commerce umbrella. We observed DNS blocking in
47 ASes (out of 51) during this week showing that the blocking is
country-wide and is not localized. The highest increase in blocking
was in AS 45688 (UT-NSRG). Again, we find that Censored Planet’s
large scale and data processing robustness helps us uncover censorship
events in countries generally regarded as free.

Table 4 shows the categories of domains and their overall average
Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5). Anonymization tools are at the top of
the list, suggesting that censors are actively trying to prevent their
users from access content through any means necessary, and pro-
vides further motivation for testing reachability to circumvention
system using Censored Planet’s rapid focus capabilities. Websites
related to foreign military and pornography follow.
Table 5 showcases the top 5 countries and the top 3 categories
in each country having the highest Cens(Smooth) (Equation 5)
in each censorship method measured by Censored Planet. Our
results agree with observations from other censorship measurement
platforms [7, 104] but some unexpected countries (Vatican City,
Oman) enter the list because of the improved scale of Censored
Planet. China, Iran and Turkmenistan still dominate the list, with
pornography and anonymization tools being highly blocked in all
of these countries.
