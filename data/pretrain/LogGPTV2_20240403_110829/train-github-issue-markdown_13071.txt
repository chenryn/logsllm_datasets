We are planning to implement horizontal pod autoscaling base on custom
metrics.
The custom metrics need to be exposed by each of pods from RC/deployment as
described in custom metrics proposal.
Spec of HPA will contain a list of custom metric names together with their
target utilizations. If the desired numbers of pods resulting from different
custom metrics utilizations are different, the autoscaler will choose the
bigger number. HPA Status will contain latest observed values of the custom
metrics.
Proposed modification in the API:
    type CustomMetricTargetUtilization struct {
        Metric string
        Target float64
    }
    type HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec struct {
        ...
        CustomMetricUtilizations []CustomMetricTargetUtilization
    }
    type CustomMetricCurrentValue struct {
        Metric string
        Value float64
    }
    type HorizontalPodAutoscalerStatus struct {
        ...
        CustomMetricValues []CustomMetricCurrentValue
    }
