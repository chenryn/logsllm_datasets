We are planning to implement horizontal pod autoscaling based on custom metrics. Each pod within a ReplicationController or Deployment must expose these custom metrics, as outlined in the custom metrics proposal.

The HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) specification will include a list of custom metric names along with their target utilizations. If the desired number of pods, derived from different custom metrics, varies, the autoscaler will select the larger number to ensure sufficient capacity. The HPA status will reflect the most recent observed values of these custom metrics.

### Proposed API Modifications:

```go
type CustomMetricTargetUtilization struct {
    Metric string
    Target float64
}

type HorizontalPodAutoscalerSpec struct {
    // ... other fields
    CustomMetricUtilizations []CustomMetricTargetUtilization
}

type CustomMetricCurrentValue struct {
    Metric string
    Value  float64
}

type HorizontalPodAutoscalerStatus struct {
    // ... other fields
    CustomMetricValues []CustomMetricCurrentValue
}
```

This structure ensures that the HPA can dynamically adjust the number of pods based on the specified custom metrics and their target utilizations, while also providing visibility into the current state of these metrics.
