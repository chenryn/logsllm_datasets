**Applies to:**
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `servermanagercmd` utility is used to install and remove roles, role services, and features on a Windows Server. It can also display a list of all available and installed roles, role services, and features.

**Important Note:**
The `servermanagercmd` command has been deprecated and may not be supported in future releases of Windows. It is recommended to use the Windows PowerShell cmdlets available for Server Manager instead. For more information, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](#).

**Syntax:**

```plaintext
servermanagercmd -query [[[:]]] [-logpath [[:]]]
servermanagercmd -inputpath  [[[:]]] [-resultpath  [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath [[:]]]
servermanagercmd -install  [-allSubFeatures] [-resultpath [[:]] [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath [[:]]]
servermanagercmd -remove  [-resultpath  [-restart] | -whatif] [-logpath  [[:]]]
servermanagercmd [-help | -?]
servermanagercmd -version
```

**Parameters:**

- **-query [[[:]]]**
  - Displays a list of all roles, role services, and features installed and available for installation on the server.
  - You can use the short form `-q`.
  - If you want the query results saved to an XML file, specify an XML file to replace `<XMLFile>`.

- **-inputpath  [[[:]]]**
  - Installs or removes the roles, role services, and features specified in an XML answer file represented by `<XMLAnswerFile>`.
  - You can use the short form `-p`.

- **-install**
  - Installs the role, role service, or feature specified by `<Identifier>`. The identifiers are case-insensitive.
  - Multiple roles, role services, and features must be separated by spaces.
  - Optional parameters:
    - `-setting = <SettingValue>`: Specifies required settings for the installation.
    - `-allSubFeatures`: Specifies the installation of all subordinate services and features along with the parent role, role service, or feature named in the `<Identifier>` value.
    - `-resultpath <XMLFile>`: Saves installation results to an XML file represented by `<XMLFile>`. You can use the short form `-r`.
    - `-restart`: Restarts the computer automatically when installation is complete (if restarting is required by the roles or features installed).
    - `-whatif`: Displays any operations specified for the `-install` parameter. You can use the short form `-w`.
    - `-logpath <LogFile>`: Specifies a name and location for the log file, other than the default, `%windir%\temp\servermanager.log`.

- **-remove**
  - Removes the role, role service, or feature specified by `<Identifier>`. The identifiers are case-insensitive.
  - Multiple roles, role services, and features must be separated by spaces.
  - Optional parameters:
    - `-resultpath <XMLFile>`: Saves removal results to an XML file represented by `<XMLFile>`. You can use the short form `-r`.
    - `-restart`: Restarts the computer automatically when removal is complete (if restarting is required by remaining roles or features).
    - `-whatif`: Displays any operations specified for the `-remove` parameter. You can use the short form `-w`.
    - `-logpath <LogFile>`: Specifies a name and location for the log file, other than the default, `%windir%\temp\servermanager.log`.

- **-version**
  - Displays the Server Manager version number. You can use the short form `-v`.

- **-help**
  - Displays help in the Command prompt window. You can use the short form `-?`.

**Notes:**
- Some role containers do not have a command line identifier to allow installation of all role services. This is the case when role services cannot be installed in the same instance of the Server Manager command. For example, the Federation Service role service of Active Directory Federation Services and the Federation Service Proxy role service cannot be installed using the same Server Manager command instance.
- You cannot run `servermanagercmd` with both the `-resultpath` parameter and the `-whatif` parameter specified.

**Examples:**

1. To display a list of all roles, role services, and features available, and which roles, role services, and features are installed on the computer:
   ```plaintext
   servermanagercmd -query
   ```

2. To install the Web Server (IIS) role, and save the installation results to an XML file represented by `installResult.xml`:
   ```plaintext
   servermanagercmd -install Web-Server -resultpath installResult.xml
   ```

3. To display detailed information about the roles, role services, and features that would be installed or removed, based upon instructions that are specified in an XML answer file represented by `install.xml`:
   ```plaintext
   servermanagercmd -inputpath install.xml -whatif
   ```
