### Title: Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation in GCP: Compromising Organizations Without Dropping an Implant

**Abstract:**

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has a unique security model that differs significantly from AWS. By default, various GCP services such as Spark jobs, Cloud Functions, and Jupyter Notebooks are granted administrative capabilities over cloud APIs. Instead of starting with no permissions, these services are assigned to default identities with broad access. One critical permission is the `actAs` capability, which allows a service to assume the identity of any service account within its project. These service accounts often have role bindings across multiple projects and organizational resources, enabling lateral movement and privilege escalation without the need for deploying any malicious implants.

In this presentation, we will demonstrate several techniques to exploit the `actAs` permission, perform privilege escalation, and move laterally across an organization's GCP infrastructure. We will also release tools to facilitate these exploitation techniques.

Next, we will explore the detection capabilities available in the Google Cloud ecosystem. We will analyze Stackdriver logs corresponding to our exploitation methods and highlight the limitations in current monitoring solutions. Additionally, we will share tools and queries that can be used for detecting such attacks and provide insights into how we have addressed this challenge at scale.

Finally, we will discuss remediation strategies that GCP customers can implement to protect their environments. We will illustrate the challenges involved in securing against these types of attacks and release tools designed to harden your organization's GCP infrastructure. We will also share real-world user stories and anecdotes from our experience in implementing these security measures at scale.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Understanding the unique security model of GCP and its implications.
- Techniques for identity compromise, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.
- Tools and queries for detecting and mitigating these attacks.
- Best practices and remediation strategies for securing GCP environments.
