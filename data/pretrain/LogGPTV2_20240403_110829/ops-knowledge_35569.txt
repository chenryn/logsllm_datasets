User: I have a python script calling an exe file. The exe file can be in the same folder as that of the python script or in a network drive. Is it possible to call the exe if it is in a remote drive/computer? Can this be done by setting the %PATH% variable
Assistant: Yes you can put a UNC path in your %PATH% env variable, and it will work if you have access to that path with your current session.
