Simply trying to add `OrbitControls` to `three.min.js` by following the
instructions in the Wiki. Working from a fresh clone of the master branch of
r120 on a Windows 10 machine with current Node and npm. Added the line
`export { OrbitControls } from '../examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';`
to `src/Three.js` and ran `npm install` followed by `npm run build-closure`.
The resulting file is twice as big as expected, and further runs of the build
keep increasing file sizes. Either something critical is missing from the Wiki
instructions or there is an error somewhere.
