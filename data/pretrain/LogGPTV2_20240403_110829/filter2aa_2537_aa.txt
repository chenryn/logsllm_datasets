### Why Should You Care?
- Your inbound and outbound traffic can be passively intercepted.
- Your data can be stored, dropped, filtered, or modified.
- This issue cannot be resolved without provider cooperation.
- It is unlikely to be noticed unless you are specifically looking for it.

### Agenda
1. **BGP & Internet 101**
2. **Historical Hijackings**
3. **The Main Methodology**
   - MITM method, explained
   - Graphs and visual aids
   - Live Demo

### BGP 101: How is the Internet 'Glued' Together?
- **No Central Core:** The Internet is a decentralized network.
- **Individual Networks (ASNs):** Networks interconnect and "announce" IP space to each other.
- **Announcement Details:** Contains IP prefix, AS-PATH, communities, and other attributes.
- **AS-PATH:** A list of who has passed the announcement along, used to avoid loops.
- **Routing Tenet:** More-specific prefixes take precedence (e.g., 10.0.0.0/24 over 10.0.0.0/8).

### Network Relationship Norms
- **Peer:** No monetary exchange, routes are not redistributed to transits and other peers.
- **Customer:** Pays transit provider to accept their announcement and sends routes to peers and transits.

### On Prefixes
- **Trust-Based Routing:** There is no "chain of trust" in IP assignments.
- **ICANN and RIRs:** ICANN assigns space to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs like ARIN, RIPE, AFRINIC).
- **RIRs to ISPs/LIRs:** RIRs assign space to ISPs or Local Internet Registries (LIRs).
- **ASN and IP Association:** No direct association between ASN and IP for most assignments (except in the RIPE region).

### The Problem
- **Route/Prefix Filtering Varies:**
  - **Customers:** Often unfiltered BGP, with max-prefix and sometimes AS-PATH filters.
  - **Verification:** Larger carriers use IRR-sourced inter-AS filters.
  - **Peers:** Typically have minimal filtering beyond max-prefix and scripts to alert on unusual announcements.

### The Internet Routing Registry (IRR)
- **Proposal:** A way for ISPs to register their routes and routing policies.
- **Distributed Servers:** Mirror each other to provide redundancy.
- **Filtering Benefits:** Can prevent some accidental hijackings.
- **Caveats:**
  - Scalability issues with large prefix-lists.
  - Insecure and full of outdated information.
  - Anyone can register almost any route.

### An IRR Update
- **Example Transaction:**
  - Diagnostic output from an IRRd routing registry system.
  - Successful addition of a route: `24.120.56.0/24 AS26627`.

### Traditional Hijacking Uses
- **Non-Malicious Use:** Popular in 2001 as a faster alternative to obtaining IPs legitimately.
- **Fly-by Spammers:** Announce space, spam, withdraw, and avoid abuse complaints.
- **Malicious DoS or Outage:** Silence competitors.
- **Target Impersonation:** Hijack specific IP ranges (e.g., Twitter's 128.121.146.0/24) and impersonate them.

### Criminality
- **Legal Ambiguity:** If no one is using the IP, is it illegal?
- **IP Prefix:** Just a number.
- **No Prosecutions:** No known prosecutions for non-malicious announcements.
- **Worst Case:** ARIN/RIPE may pull PTR records and transits may shut you off.

### How to Hijack
- **Full Hijacking:**
  - Find an IP network with a contact email at a domain that has expired.
  - Register the domain/email and change the contact.
  - Announce the network since filtering is often lax.
- **Upstream Providers:** Too busy to care, and they are paid to accept routes.

### Historical Hijackings
- **AS7007 (1997):** Accidental redistribution broke the Internet.
- **146.20/16:** Erie Forge and Steel.
- **166.188/16:** Carabineros De Chile (Chile Police) hijacked twice by a registered entity.
- **Accidental Hijackings:** Common and often go unnoticed.

### 02/08 YouTube Hijack Saga
- **YouTube Announces 5 Prefixes:**
  - Including 208.65.152.0/22.
- **Pakistanâ€™s Government Blocks YouTube:**
  - Created a more specific route (208.65.153.0/24) to null0.
- **Redistribution Issue:**
  - Routes were redistributed via BGP, leading to global disruption.
- **Resolution:**
  - YouTube announced more specific /25s.
  - PCCW turned off Pakistan Telecom peering, and the BGP table was cleaned up within minutes.

### IP Hijacking BoF
- **Unofficial Event at NANOG Conference:**
  - Tests the security of Internet routing infrastructure.
  - Recent exercises:
    - Hijacked 1.0.0.0/8: 90% success.
    - Hijacked 146.20.0.0/16: 95% success.
    - Attempted to announce networks longer than /24: 40% successful overall.

### Routing Security Is Complicated
- **Lack of Chain of Trust:** From ICANN down.
- **Weakest Link Problem:** Until everyone filters perfectly, the risk remains.
- **Best Practices:** Use alerting systems like PHAS, RIPE MyASN, and Renesys to detect rogue announcements.
