User: Based on the following code snippet, please explain what a RESTful API is and provide a practical application scenario. A practical application scenario is the product management module in e-commerce applications. Using the RESTful API design can uniformly map the identification, status, and behavior of product resources. For example, GET requests for product lists can obtain all products, POST requests can create new products, PUT requests can update product information, and DELETE requests can delete specified products. In this way, not only can the CRUD operation of product information be realized, but also the interaction and collaboration between different systems can be facilitated. For example, the client application can use the RESTful API to obtain product information for users to purchase or browse. RESTful API can also be used for communication to facilitate system expansion and maintenance.
Assistant: RESTful API is an API design method that conforms to the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. It uniformly maps resources, states and behaviors, and uses the request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) in the HTTP protocol to achieve Operations on resources. RESTful API has the advantages of readability, scalability, extensibility and portability, and has become an important way of Internet application development.
