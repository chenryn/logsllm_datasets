User: Install and configure a Docker environment for rapid application deployment.
Assistant: Here are the steps to install and configure a Docker environment on Ubuntu: 1. Update Ubuntu's package list: ``` sudo apt-get update ``` 2. Install Docker's dependencies: ``` sudo apt-get install apt -transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common ``` 3. Add Docker's official GPG key: ``` curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt -key add - ``` 4. Add Docker's apt repository: ``` sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs ) stable" ``` 5. Update the package list: ``` sudo apt-get update ``` 6. Install Docker: ``` sudo apt-get install docker-ce ``` 7. Verify that Docker is installed correctly : ``` sudo docker run hello-world ``` If Docker is installed correctly, the hello-world Docker image will be downloaded and run, and a message will be output. Next, you can use Docker to deploy the application. The environment and settings of the application can be defined using the Dockerfile file, and the Docker image can be built using the docker build command. Docker images can run in any environment that supports Docker, making application deployment and portability easier.
