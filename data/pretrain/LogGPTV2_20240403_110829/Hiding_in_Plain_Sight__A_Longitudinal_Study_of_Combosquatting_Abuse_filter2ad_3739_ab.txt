presented in Table 4, and derive the trademark–specific datasets,
which can be seen in Table 5. The datasets in Table 5 will be used to
study the combosquatting problem in depth since 2011. We begin by
extracting the Combosquatting Passive (CP) and Combosquatting
Active DNS (CA) set of domains, which reflect combosquatting
domains containing at least one of the trademarks of interest in the
Passive and Active DNS datasets, respectively. The cardinalities of
these two sets are of the order of millions of domain names (2.3M
for the CP set and 1M for the CA), and all combosquatting domain
abuse should be bounded by the size of the two sets.
Following the same process, we identify the combosquatting
domains in the PBL, APT, Spamtrap, Malware and Alexa sets, deriv-
ing Cpbl , Capt , Cspa, Cmal and Cale, respectively. The cardinalities
of these sets can be seen in Table 5 where they span from a few
domains (Capt ) to several tens of thousands of domains (Cmal and
Cale). Finally, we will define Cabuse as the set of domains in all ma-
licious categories of combosquatting domains, namely Cpbl , Capt ,
Cspa, and Cmal .
4 MEASURING COMBOSQUATTING
DOMAINS
In this section we present short and long term measurements re-
volving around the combosquatting domains in our datasets. We
begin by investigating the differences between typosquatting and
combosquatting. At the same time we discuss which words attack-
ers choose to combine with popular trademarks more frequently.

Then, we study the temporal properties of the domain names in the
combosquatting passive and active DNS datasets. This analysis will
help us understand how these combosquatting domains evolved
since 2011.
In particular, we observe that the number of combosquatting
domain names in our passive and active DNS datasets are steadily
increasing; in contrast, the domains in the Cabuse set remain stable
over time. At the same time, we observer that the security commu-
nity is lagging behind the detection of malicious combosquatting
domains, in many cases up to several months, despite being an
obvious target of abuse. Finally, we provide an analysis of the DNS
and IP hosting infrastructure that combosquatters tend to employ.
The domains in the Cabuse set tend to utilize significantly more
agile hosting infrastructure, which could be used as a signal to
identify abusive combosquatting domains on the rise.
4.1 Combosquatting versus Typosquatting
Since typosquatting is, by far, the most researched type of domain
squatting, we begin our discussion of combosquatting by compar-
ing it with typosquatting. Figure 2 shows the number of active
typosquatting and combosquatting domains targeting our evalu-
ated trademarks since 2011. To identify typosquatting domains, we
use the five typosquatting models of Wang et al. [90] to generate
all possible typosquatting domains and search for those domains in
our DNS datasets. The left part of the plot is based on our passive
DNS dataset while the right part is based on the active DNS dataset.
One can clearly see that, even though combosquatting has evaded
the attention of researchers, it is significantly more prevalent than
typosquatting, with the number of daily combosquatting domains
being almost two orders of magnitude larger than the number of
typosquatting domains.
In comparison with other types of domain squatting phenom-
ena such as typosquatting, combosquatting has a unique property
in that it lacks a generative model. For all other types of domain
squatting, researchers can start with an authoritative domain, and
by performing character and bit swaps, they can exhaustively list
the possible squatting permutations for a given type of domain
squatting. For example, the dotted line in Figure 2 indicates the
maximum number of typosquatting domains possible when consid-
ering the evaluated trademarks and typosquatting models [90]. In
combosquatting, however, attackers are free to prefix and postfix
a trademark with one or more keywords of their choice, bounded
only by the maximum number of characters allowed for any given
label by the DNS protocol [65, 66].
Another difference that is closely related to the lack of a gener-
ative model, in terms of attack scenarios, has to do with the way
attacks are rendered. Typosquatting can be a passive attack for the
adversary, who simply must wait until a user accidentally types in
a domain. However, combosquatting requires more active involve-
ment from the attacker because, while a user may accidentally type
paypa[.]com instead of paypal[.]com, an attacker cannot register
paypal-members[.]com and reasonably expect users will acciden-
tally type those eight extra characters. Therefore, miscreants that
rely on combosquatting must coerce users (e.g. via spam emails
and social networks) to visit combosquatting domains.
To increase the chances that users will interact with their mali-
cious combosquatting domains, attackers can use services like Let’s
Encrypt [56] to both freely and automatically obtain TLS certifi-
cates for their domains. In fact, Let’s Encrypt has recently come
Session C2:  World Wide Web of WickednessCCS’17, October 30-November 3, 2017, Dallas, TX, USA573Figure 2: Number of active Combosquatting and Typosquatting domain names per day. The left hand side part of the plot depicts the passive DNS
period, whereas the right one reflects domains found in the active DNS dataset.
under criticism for choosing to eschew any sort of security checks
before giving domain owners a TLS certificate [11]. To quantify the
frequency with which attackers obtain certificates for their mali-
cious domains, we searched the 271 million certificates obtained
via the Certificate Transparency append-only log (described in Sec-
tion 3.2) and discovered that 691,182 certificates were given to a
total of 107,572 fully-qualified combosquatting domains related to
our trademarks, since 2013, with 41.5% of the certificates being
issued by Let’s Encrypt. In contrast, only 3,011 certificates were
issued for typosquatting domains. This finding further confirms the
intuition that typosquatting and combosquatting are two distinct
phenomena with different threat models and attack strategies.
In summary, we argue that existing domain squatting detection
systems are not taking combosquatting domains into account (since
they cannot generate them) and combosquatting requires its own
analysis due to the scale of the problem and the different threat
models involved.
4.2 Lexical Characteristics
The lack of generative models for combosquatting, makes it hard to
proactively create and evaluate domains. Therefore, we utilize the
DNS datasets mentioned previously, to identify combosquatting
domains and analyze their composition. In particular, we see that
adversaries do not usually register lengthy domains and do not
use many words when generating the domains. We also find that
there are certain words that adversaries favor when generating
abusive combosquatting domains. Some words are independent of
the trademark’s business category, and other words are specific to
a single category.
Figure 3a shows the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
of the length of all identified combosquatting domains. There we
can see that even though an attacker can, in principle, construct
very long domains, 60% of the identified combosquatting domains
were using less than ten characters and 80% of the combosquatting
domains were using less than 22 characters (excluding the original
squatted trademark). This provides an early indication that the
vast majority of the attackers carefully construct combosquatting
domain names without attempting to reach the limits afforded to
them by the DNS protocol.
To better understand the construction of combosquatting do-
mains, we extract the non-Top Level Domain (non-TLD) part of each
domain (e.g. we extract facebookfriends from facebookfriends
[.] com) and use the word segmentation algorithm described in [79].
This algorithm takes a string as input and outputs sequences of
that string that have a high probability of being standalone tokens,
along with a confidence score for the provided tokenization.
We validate the output tokens provided for each combosquatting
domain against four dictionaries: (1) the PyEnchant en_US Python
dictionary [76] to identify English words, (2) the No Swearing dic-
tionary [16] to identify swearing-related words, and both (3) the
SWOPODS [81] and (4) No Slang [15] dictionaries to identify slang
words in US English. Tokens that are found in any of these dictio-
naries are referred to as words and, when not found, we simply call
them segments.
Figure 3b depicts a CDF of the number of tokens and number of
words that were identified for each domain. We see that almost 80%
of the domains have at most two dictionary-words present, and
90% have at most three words. At the same time, we have found a
limited number of cases that contain up to 28 words and segments.
These results validate our earlier length-based claim that squatters
appear to be methodical in their construction of combosquatting
domain names. We note that stop words and other short words have
not been removed from our datasets because they are frequently
used by combosquatting domains.
Figure 3c shows the correlation of segments (cyan) and actual
words (blue). Every bin in the radial histogram represents the num-
ber of tokens identified in each domain. The presented percentage
captures the number of actual words versus segments that we were
able to distinguish. As we can see, the middle ranges of token counts
(6 to 19) have a lot more segments than words, whereas when the
domain consists of fewer tokens, the number of words found in the
dictionaries mentioned earlier increases. On average, half of the
tokens are words and the other half are segments. This is likely an
artifact of the attackers’ attempts to register domains that might
include typos or several strings close to words, which could be
overlooked by the targets, in order to increase their arsenal of com-
bosquatting domains. Consider, for example, the following list of
domain names that we identified as combosquatting and all point
to a credit card activation campaign.

In terms of the words that attackers combine with abused trade-
marks, the top twenty words across all trademark categories were:
free, online, code, store, sale, air, best, price, shop, head, home, shoes,
work, www, cheap, com, new, buy, max, and card. Since the top
twenty words represent all of our 22 categories, they include terms
that can be found either in one or multiple trademark categories.
For example, the word “free” can be found in 12 of the 22 categories,
suggesting that attackers commonly combine the word “free” with
popular trademarks associated with paid goods (such as shopping,
movies, and TV shows) to lure users into interacting with their
websites. Contrastingly, certain words appear in a single category
of trademarks, such as “cheap” which is found only in the online
shopping category.
Due to space limitations, we make Table 10 available in the
Appendix that presents the ten most frequent words for each trade-
mark category. We see that many of the popular words closely
correlate with the type of trademark being abused, like the words
apple, game and phones being popular in the “Computers/Internet”
category and the words president, vote, and elect being popular
in the “Politics” category. The word selection by the adversaries
clearly indicates that most registered combosquatting domains have
been carefully constructed to match the expected context of each
abused trademark. This is a property unique to combosquatting,
since any other type of squatting is bounded to the squatted domain
name itself. For example, the search space in typosquatting, from
which adversaries can choose domain names is bounded to the
length of the domain and the characters used, limiting the agility
and multiformity of the threat.
4.3 Temporal Analysis
In Section 3.1 we presented our process for selecting the trademarks
we use in our study, and in Section 3.2 we discussed the different
datasets we use to measure the phenomenon. Using these trade-
marks and the dataset notation from Table 5, we study the temporal
properties of combosquatting domains since 2011. We find that
clients are increasingly resolving combosquatting domains and that
more than half of all combosquatting domains share a minimum

we saw it appearing in our passive DNS dataset. Almost 50% of the
domain names in the CP set were active for at least 100 days. In the
same figure, we can observe the malicious class of combosquatting
domain names, which are in the Cabuse set (presented earlier in
Table 5).
Interestingly, Figure 5a also shows that the lifetime of abusive
combosquatting domains is greater than the entire combosquatting
passive DNS set. This makes intuitive sense because a large number
of abusive combosquatting domains facilitate malicious network
communication for prolonged periods of time.
Figure 5b presents how fast the community comes across these
combosquatting domains. In the cases of domains from the sets
Cmal and Cpbl , we see that most domains are active several months
before they appear in malware traces, or get listed in public black
lists. The only exception is the spam trap that the security vendor
is operating, where more than 50% of the domain names in the
Cspa set appear in passive DNS either a few days before, or on
the same day that they appear in the spam trap. One reasonable
explanation for this behavior is that it is an artifact of the type of
abuse (i.e., spam monetization and social engineering) that these
combosquatting domains facilitate.
In order to measure the overall popularity of the domains in the
combosquatting passive DNS (CP) dataset over time, in Figure 5c
we show the DNS lookup volume growth since 2011, according
to our PDNS dataset. To put things into perspective, in the same
figure, we plot the lookup volume of domains in the Cabuse set.
It is interesting to observe that while the domains in the CP set
have a steady growth over time, the lookup volume of malicious
domain names in the set Cabuse appears to be nearly uniform. Even
though we lack a definite explanation of this behavior, our earlier
spam-trap-related results suggest that this almost uniform activity
is an artifact of the type of combosquatting abuse (i.e. related to
spam and social engineering) that the security industry can reliably
detect.
Another interesting observation is related to the Alexa popular-
ity of combosquatting domains. Figure 6 shows the distributions
of combosquatting domains across the top 1 million Alexa ranks,

mains since 2011. The plot depicts the mean rank for the domain
names over the period of our Cal e dataset.
lifespan of at least three months; in contrast, the majority of abusive
domains are active for more than a year. We also see that malicious
domains appear in the DNS datasets several months before they
appear in our abusive dataset and they even make it into the top
thousands ranks in the Alexa list.
Figure 4 shows the number of combosquatting domain names
we were able to place in the passive (left) and active (right) DNS
datasets. The orange color represents the total number of com-
bosquatting domain names we are able to identify in our datasets
for each of the trademark categories. Blue shows the normalized
number based on the number of trademarks that appeared in each
category. While most of the combosquatting domain names are
in “Information Technology” related categories, our dataset is
not biased, as the sets CP and CA contain a significant number of
domains across all trademarks and business categories.
By focusing our attention on the combosquatting passive DNS
set, we can see the days in which a combosquatting domain name is
available in our datasets. Figure 5a shows the CDF of this lifetime of
the domains in the CP set. We measure the lifetime of a combosquat-
ting domain as the number of days between the first and last time

both for combosquatting domains that are known to be malicious
(present in any of our abuse datasets) as well as for all of the re-
maining combosquatting domains. First, we can observe that, as we
move from higher to lower rankings, the concentration of generic
combosquatting domains increases. Even so, the overall number of
combosquatting domains that are present in the top 1 million Alexa
list is limited. In terms of the distribution of malicious combosquat-
ting domains, there we see the presence of malicious domains across
all Alexa ranks, which suggests that the existing tools for detecting
malicious domains are finding only a small fraction of live attacks,
regardless of the overall number of combosquatting activity in any
given bin of Alexa ranking. We should note that Figure 6 shows
aggregate statistics of 20,000 bins in the x-axis. Therefore, the far
left domains are cases of combosquatting domains that have made
it into any of the top 20,000 Alexa ranks.
be explained in the following two ways. There are few CIDRs and
ASes around the world that will permit the long term hosting of
malicious domains. At the same time, such malicious combosquat-
ting domains eventually will be remediated, as we saw earlier in
