User: How to set up SSH public key authentication on the Linux system to facilitate remote login to the server and operations.
Assistant: SSH public key authentication is an authentication method based on asymmetric encryption, which can help us achieve more secure remote login. The following are the steps to set up SSH public key authentication on the Linux system: 1. Generate a key pair on the client and open the terminal, and enter the command: ``` ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 ``` Among them, `-t` The parameter specifies that the key type is RSA, and the `-b` parameter specifies that the key length is 4096 bits. After executing the command, the system will prompt you to enter the key storage path and set a password for the key. You can press the Enter key to skip setting the password. 2. Copy the public key to the remote server Execute the following command to copy the public key to the remote server: ``` ssh-copy-id username@server_ip ``` Among them, `username` is the username of the remote server, `server_ip ` is the IP address of the remote server. If you cannot use the `ssh-copy-id` command, you can manually copy the public key file (stored in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` by default) to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the remote server. 3. Configure SSH service In the remote server, modify the SSH service configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, make sure the following two settings are enabled: ``` PubkeyAuthentication yes AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys ``` Save the file and restart SSH Service: ``` sudo service ssh restart ``` 4. Use the public key authentication to log in to the remote server Execute the following command to log in to the remote server: ``` ssh username@server_ip ``` The system will automatically use the private key you generated to authenticate you , to complete the login process. Note: Before using SSH public key authentication to log in to the remote server, you first need to ensure that secure communication has been established between the client and the server, such as using a secure network connection or VPN.
