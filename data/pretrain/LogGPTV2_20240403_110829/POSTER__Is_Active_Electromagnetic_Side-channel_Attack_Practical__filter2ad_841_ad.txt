### Results [26]

Certain CPU operations are more clearly reflected in the device's power consumption rather than in its electromagnetic (EM) emissions, and vice versa. Similarly, malware running on a victim's computer can assist an EM side-channel attacker by intentionally modulating data into the EM emissions of the CPU or monitor [105, 106, 94].

### Unintentional EM Emissions and Interference

Unintentional EM emissions from computing devices can interfere with other radio signals in the vicinity. This phenomenon is particularly evident in laptop computers, which have been shown to modulate signals from commercial AM radio stations [107]. Internet of Things (IoT) devices can use this interference to communicate purposefully with other devices by modulating ambient RF signals, a technique known as backscatter communication [108]. Various carrier wave sources, including TV transmission stations and WiFi access points, have been tested in the literature [109, 110, 111, 112]. The potential for using backscatter phenomena to eavesdrop on internal CPU operations of IoT devices by listening to ambient RF sources warrants further investigation.

### EM Emissions in Wired Networks

Devices deployed in wired networks, such as routers and switches, are known sources of EM noise. It has been demonstrated that MAC addresses in Ethernet frames can be extracted by performing Side-Channel Electromagnetic Analysis (SEMA) on the EM emissions from wired routers [113]. When investigating a live wired network, it is often necessary to connect to the network to inspect packets [114]. In such situations, the EM emissions from routers and switches can provide an approximate picture of the workload and traffic on the network [115].

### Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), incorporating machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have shown promising applications across various domains in computer science. Tasks that previously required human intuition for decision-making are now being replaced by ML/DL-powered algorithms. Software libraries and frameworks are becoming increasingly available to assist in building applications with intelligent capabilities. Examples include the automated detection of malicious programs [116], image manipulation [117], and anomaly detection in network traces [118].

### AI in EM Side-Channel Analysis

EM side-channel analysis techniques that once required human intervention can now be automated through the development of AI algorithms. Recent work by Wang et al. [119] applied deep learning algorithms, including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM), to detect anomalies in the code of simple IoT devices like Arduino and Raspberry Pi through the power consumption side-channel. This suggests that better information can potentially be extracted from EM traces than what current manual observations can achieve. Several examples discussed in previous sections already leverage AI techniques to recognize EM trace patterns, hinting at the future role AI algorithms can play in EM side-channel analysis for digital forensics [43, 120, 48, 49, 54, 60].

### Conclusions

Traditionally, digital forensics focuses on analyzing traces left behind by suspects on digital devices by inspecting file storage, log files, and network traces. Live data forensics can also be performed on systems that require more sophisticated investigative techniques and skills. As computing systems evolve from less privacy and security-conscious platforms into hardened platforms designed with security in mind, the typical work conducted by digital forensic investigators must adapt accordingly. Cryptographically protected storage systems pose one of the largest challenges to efficient digital forensic analysis. EM side-channel analysis has been demonstrated as a potential tool for accessing cryptographically protected data storage and communications, which can be built upon and adopted for digital forensic purposes.

This paper comprehensively analyzes the literature on EM side-channel attacks with the goal of applying these techniques to assist digital forensic investigations on IoT devices. While various mitigation techniques have been suggested and applied to counter EM side-channel attacks, existing literature shows that such attempts have not been successful in reducing the prevalence of this attack vector. EM side-channel analysis is still in its infancy for digital forensic applications, which demands court-admissible, forensically sound processing when used not only for obtaining security keys but also for detecting unintentional data leakage. However, this technique has significant potential to impact the field and enable the progression of otherwise stalled investigative cases involving both IoT devices and encrypted computing devices in general.
