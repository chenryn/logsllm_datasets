sults [26]. There can be some operations of the CPU
that are more clearly reﬂected in the device’s power con-
sumption than in the EM emission and vice versa. Sim-
ilarly, malware running on a victim computer can aid an
EM side-channel attacker to extract additional informa-
tion (over the EM side-channel alone) by intentionally
modulating data into the EM emission of the CPU or the
monitor [105, 106, 94].
The unintentional EM emissions from computing de-
vices can cause interference to other radio signals in the
vicinity. This phenomena is evident in laptop computers,
which have been shown to modulate signals from com-
mercial AM radio stations [107]. IoT devices already use
this interference phenomena to communicate purposefully
with other devices by modulating the ambient RF signals.
This is called backscatter communication technology [108].
There are various carrier wave sources that have been
tested in the literature including TV transmission stations
and WiFi access points [109, 110, 111, 112]. The potential
of using this backscatter phenomena to eavesdrop on inter-
nal CPU operations of IoT devices by listening to ambient
RF sources warrants further exploration.
Devices deployed in wired networks, such as routers
and switches, are known EM noise sources. It has been
already showed that MAC addresses in Ethernet frames
can be extracted by performing SEMA analysis on the EM
emissions from wired routers [113]. When it is required
to perform an investigation on a live wired network, it is
necessary to be connected in order to inspect packets [114].
In situations like this, the EM emissions of routers and
switches might be able to provide an approximate picture
of the workload and traﬃc on the network [115].
Recent advances that have been made in the area of
artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) (incorporating machine learning
(ML) and deep learning (DL)) have demonstrated promis-
ing applications to many other domains across computer
10
science. Various tasks where human intuition was required
to perform decision making are now being replaced with
ML/DL powered algorithms. Software libraries and frame-
works are becoming increasingly available in order to as-
sist the building of applications that have intelligent ca-
pabilities. Examples include the automated detection of
malicious programs [116], image manipulation [117], and
anomaly detection in network traces [118].
EM side-channel analysis techniques that previously re-
quired human intervention can be automated through the
development of AI algorithms. Recent work by Wang et
al. [119] applied deep learning algorithms including multi-
layer perceptron (MLP) and long short-term memory (LSTM)
to detect anomalies in the code of simple IoT devices, e.g.,
Arduino and Raspberry Pi, through the power consump-
tion side-channel. Therefore, it is potentially possible to
extract better information from EM traces than the cur-
rent manual observations are capable of achieving. Several
examples that were discussed in previous sections already
leverages AI techniques to recognise EM trace patterns,
which strongly hints the future role that can be played
by AI algorithms in EM side-channel analysis for digital
forensics [43, 120, 48, 49, 54, 60].
8. Conclusions
Traditionally, digital forensics focuses on analysing traces
left behind by suspects on digital devices by inspecting ﬁle
storage, log ﬁles, network traces, etc. Live data forensics
can also be performed on systems that require more so-
phisticated investigative techniques and skills. As com-
puting systems transform from less privacy and security
concerned platforms into hardened platforms that are de-
signed with security in mind from their inception, the typ-
ical work conducted by digital forensic investigators must
change accordingly. Cryptographically protected storage
systems is one of the largest challenges hindering eﬃcient
digital forensic analysis. EM side-channel analysis has
been demonstrated as a potential door-opener for cryp-
tographically protected data storage and communications
from a security perspective, which can be built upon and
adopted for digital forensic purposes.
This paper comprehensively analysed the literature on
EM side-channel attacks with the goal of applying the
technique to assist digital forensic investigations on IoT de-
vices. While various mitigation techniques have been sug-
gested and applied to counter against EM side-channel at-
tacks, existing literature demonstrates that such attempts
have not been successful in reducing the prevalence of
this attack vector. EM side-channel analysis is still in its
infancy for digital forensic applications, which demands
court-admissible, forensically-sound processing when used
not only for obtaining security keys but also for the de-
tection of unintentional data leakage. However, this tech-
nique has signiﬁcant potential to have a substantial im-
pact on the ﬁeld and enable the progression of otherwise
stalled investigative cases involving both IoT devices, and
encrypted computing devices in general.
