User: Working on windows platform, I have a python application which once invoked, remembers its state and resumes in case of system crash or reboot. The application actually runs some other executables or in technological terms is of type framework. The typical scenario where the executable need to run with admin mode passes for first time but fails after resuming from crash or reboot. 
What I believe is I need to invoke the resumed application with admin mode. In what way this could be achieved, Thanks in advance!
Assistant: For Linux, see documentation on upstart (for Ubuntu) or service (for RedHat). The write a start-up script to start your Python script with appropriate rights. You can also configure it to be restarted if it crashes.
Windows has a similar facility for start-up programs, where you can register your program to start.
