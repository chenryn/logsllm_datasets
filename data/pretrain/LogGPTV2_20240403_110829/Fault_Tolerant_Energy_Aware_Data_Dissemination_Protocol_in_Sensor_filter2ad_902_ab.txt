the  protocol 
and the cost of going to the destination through each of 
its  neighbors.    The  cost  can  be  calculated  based  on  the 
distance  or  on  a  weighted  mean  of  distance,  remaining 
energy source, and traffic load. Maintaining n entries for 
each  destination  enables 
tolerate 
concurrent failures of n intermediate nodes. For a given 
node, the next hop node in the path to a given destination 
as  decided  by DBF  is  called  its next hop neighbor.  The 
convergence time of DBF with n nodes is O(n.e), where 
e is the number of edges. (which is equivalent to O(n3) in 
a fully connected graph). The zone’s size is expected to 
be much smaller than the entire sensor network size for 
the  small  transmission  radius  of  sensor  nodes  and 
reasonable  node  densities  of  most  sensor  network 
deployments.  Therefore, 
is  not 
considered  prohibitive  for  the  sizes  of  zones  in  practice 
(5-50  nodes).  When  a  node  moves  or  a  failure  occurs, 
the  routing  tables  of  its  zone  neighbors  get  updated 
through re-execution of the DBF. 
the  cost  of  DBF 
The  nodes  start 
it  advertises 
transmitting  after 
the  routing 
converges, i.e., a run of DBF terminates.  The first phase 
of  data  transmission  involves  meta-data  exchange  as  in 
SPIN.  When  a  node  (the  source)  has  some  data  to 
transmit, 
its  data  using  an  ADV 
(advertisement)  packet  broadcast  to  its  zone  neighbors. 
On receiving the ADV packet from its zone neighbor, a 
node  first  checks  if  it  needs  that  data  by  reading  the 
meta-data in the ADV packet. If it does, the node sends a 
REQ  (request)  packet  to  the  source.  In  SPIN  a  REQ 
packet  is  sent  directly  to  the  source,  but  in  SPMS  the 
node  sends  the  REQ  packet  to  the  source  through  the 
shortest  path.  Thus,  if  the  source  is  not  the  next  hop 
neighbor, the REQ packet is sent through multiple hops. 
If  the  destination  realizes  it  has  to  do  multi-hop 
communication  for  its  REQ  packet,  it  waits  for  a  pre-
determined  fixed  period  of  time  before  sending  the 
request  packet.  The  logic  is  that  every  node  should 
request  the  data  from  nodes  which  are  close  by  and 
hence  can  be  reached  by  transmitting  at  the  lowest 
possible  power  level.  If  there  are  relay  nodes  between 
the destination node and the source node, the destination 
node waits, expecting to hear the ADV of the data from 
a  relay  node.  The  SPMS  protocol  requires  a  node  to 
advertise  its  own  data  as  well  as  all  received  data  once 
amongst  its  neighbors.  Hence,  if  any  intermediate  relay 
node  gets  the  data,  it  advertises  the  data.  To  handle  the 
case  when  the  relay  node  does  not  request  the  data,  the 
destination  node  starts  a 
the 
advertisement and on its expiry sends the REQ packet to 
the source through the shortest route. The timer for this 
purpose is (cid:87)ADV and the timeout value is set to TOutADV.
In this case, the REQ packet still goes through the relay 
node  but  it  is  destined  for  the  source  node.  By  sending 
the  REQ  packet  through  the  shortest  path  in  multi-hop 
fashion,  SPMS  saves  energy  compared 
to  direct 
timer  on  hearing 
transmission  to  the  source  node.  The  energy  saving 
comes  from  both  the  transmission  and  the  reception 
energy.  The  transmission  at  the  highest  power  level  for 
all the ADV, REQ, and DAT packets is costly in SPIN. 
Also,  the  transmission  at  the  high  power  level  causes 
every  node  in  the  zone  to  hear  the  message  and  then 
discard it when it realizes it is not the intended recipient, 
thus  expending  energy  due  to  reception.  In  SPMS,  the 
reception  energy  is  expended  at  the  relay  nodes.  For  k 
relay  nodes  between  the  sender  and  the  receiver,  the 
ratio of reception energy expended in SPIN and SPMS is 
2nEr/2kEr  =  n/k  >  1.  Each  node  after  sending  the  REQ 
packet  starts  a  timer  (cid:87)DAT  with  value  TOutDAT  to  avoid 
waiting  indefinitely  for  the  data.  If  the  timer  expires 
before  reception  of  the  data,  the  request  is  resent. 
Finally, the data is sent by the source in exactly the same 
manner  as  the  received  request,  i.e.,  direct  from  the 
source to the destination if they are next hop neighbors, 
otherwise 
through  multi-hop  communication.  The 
protocol’s  performance  is  dependent  on  the  setting  for 
the timers (cid:87)ADV  and (cid:87)DAT.
Note  that  in  SPMS  no  node  needs  global  state 
information,  either  for  routing  or  for  failure  status.  The 
routing  information  is  maintained  at  a  node  only  for  its 
zone  neighbors.  The  failure  information  is  obtained 
transiently  for  a  node  that  it  tries  to  communicate  with 
and gets no response.   
3.3. Example for Failure Free Case 
Consider  an  example  scenario  where  there  are  3 
nodes A (source), B and C. Each node is a zone neighbor 
of  the  other.  The  routing  tables  have  been  formed  as 
described  above  using  DBF.  The  shortest  route  from  A 
to  B  is  a  direct  transmission  to  B.  The  shortest  route 
from  A  to  C  goes  through  B.  Node  A  broadcasts  the 
ADV packet to all its zone neighbors.   
Case  I: Both  nodes  B  and  C  need  the  data.  After 
receiving  the  ADV  from  A,  B  requests  the  data  by 
sending  a  REQ  packet  to  A  directly.  On  receiving  the 
REQ  packet,  A  sends  the  DATA  packet  to  B,  again 
directly.  C  on  receiving  the  ADV  packet  checks  in  its 
routing  table  and  goes  into  a  waiting  state.  It  starts  the 
timer (cid:87)ADV and waits for B to advertise the same piece of 
data.  Node  B  on  receiving  the  data  advertises  it  in  its 
zone. Suppose C’s timer (cid:87)ADV has not expired yet. Then 
it  receives  the  ADV  packet  from  B  lying  in  its  zone. 
Since B is a next hop neighbor, C sends a REQ packet to 
B  directly,  cancels  its  timer  (cid:87)ADV and  starts  the  timer 
(cid:87)DAT. In the failure free situation, C gets the data from B 
in response to its request. 
Case  II:  B  does  not  request the  data  from  A  and  hence 
will not advertise the data.  Now, as before, C goes into 
the  waiting  state  with  its  timer  (cid:87)ADV  and  waits  for  an 
ADV packet from B. After the timer expires, C sends a

REQ  packet  to  A  but  through  the  shortest  route,  i.e., 
routed  through  B.  B  relays  the  REQ  packet to  A  and A 
finally sends the DATA packet back to C through B. 
3.4. Design for Failure Cases 
SPMS relies on the relay nodes for data delivery and  
should be resilient to intermediate node and link failures. 
At  any  stage  of  the  protocol,  the  destination  node 
maintains  a  Primary  Originator  Node  (PRONE)  and  a 
Secondary  Originator  Node  (SCONE).  The  PRONE  is 
the first choice node for requesting the data from, while 
the  SCONE  is  the  second  choice  to  be  used  in  case  the 
PRONE  is  unreachable  because  of  a  link  failure  or 
because the PRONE itself is down. In a general scenario, 
multiple  SCONES  may  be  maintained  for  tolerating 
more than one concurrent failure. At the beginning of the 
protocol, both PRONE and SCONE are initialized to the 
data  source  node.  If  the  destination  node  receives  an 
ADV packet from a closer node, then it sets the PRONE 
to be the closer node and the SCONE to be the PRONE 
from the earlier stage. In Figure 1, B is the PRONE and 
A is the SCONE for C after it receives the ADV packet 
from B.  
If the (cid:87)DAT timer expires before the node gets the data, 
it sends the REQ packet to the SCONE. If the (cid:87)DAT timer 
of  a  node  expires  because  the  closer  node  (call  it  NC)
failed after getting the data, the destination node has no 
way  of  distinguishing  between  this  case  and  the  case 
where  the  closer  node  did  not  request  for  the  data.  The 
destination  node  sends  a  REQ  packet  to  its  PRONE 
using multi-hop routing which may go through NC. If NC
has failed, the destination node’s (cid:87)DAT timer expires and 
it  finally  requests  the  data  directly  from  the  PRONE, 
using  a  higher  transmission  power.  Note  that  it  is 
guaranteed  to  reach  its  PRONE  using  an  available 
transmission  power  since  they  are  each  other’s  zone 
neighbors.  Thus, SPMS can tolerate
1. Failure  of  the  source  node  after  its  data  has  been 
received by any of its zone neighbor nodes 
2. Failure  of  any  intermediate  node  during  the  entire 
protocol.

3.5. Example for Failure Case 
In Figure  2,  the  nodes  r1,  r2  and  C  are  A’s  zone 
neighbors.  A  broadcasts  an  ADV  packet  in  its  zone, 
which is received by the three nodes. Assume that all the 
nodes  request  for  the  data.  A  is  the  PRONE  and  the 
SCONE for each of the other nodes. 
On receiving the ADV packet, nodes r2 and C go into 
waiting with timer (cid:87)ADV, but r1 goes ahead and requests 
the  data  from  A.  After  receiving  the  data,  r1  re-
advertises it in its zone. C on receiving the ADV packet 
from  r1  resets  its  timer  (cid:87)ADV  and  sets  its  PRONE  to  r1 
and SCONE to A. Node r2 cancels its timer and requests 
the data from r1 since it is its next hop neighbor.   
Suppose  r2  fails  before  sending  out  an  ADV  packet. 
Node C’s timer (cid:87)ADV expires because it does not see any 
ADV packet from r2. Then, C sends a REQ packet to r1 
using  its  shortest  path  routing  table,  which  means  it 
would  go  through  r2.  In  case  r2  fails  after  sending  out 
the  ADV  packet,  C  initiates  the  REQ  immediately  on 
receiving  the  ADV.  As  r2  has  failed,  C’s  (cid:87)DAT timer 
expires. Now C requests the data from  the PRONE (r1) 
directly using a higher transmission power. Node r1, on 
receiving  the  REQ  packet  from  C,  sends  the  data  as 
direct  transmission  because  that  was  the  route  followed 
by the REQ packet. 
4. Theoretical Evaluation 
We  compare  SPMS  against  SPIN  using  a  detailed 
mathematical analysis. The analysis deals with the delay 
and the energy consumption.  
4.1. Delay Analysis 
Let R, D, A be the lengths of REQ, DATA and ADV 
packets, Ttx the time for transmission of one unit of data, 
and TOutADV and TOutDAT  be  the  values  of  the  timers.. 
Tproc is the processing delay at a node receiving a data or 
control packet. This is independent of the number of bits 
processed.  This  eliminates  the  unrealistic  simplification 
in  the  SPIN  simulations  where  the  data  is  taken  to  be 
processed  instantaneously.  The  propagation  delay  is 
assumed  to  be  zero.  Tcsma  is  the  delay  to  access  a 
channel, which is taken to be proportional to n2, where n 
is  the  number  of  nodes  in  the  transmission  radius 
([7],[8])1. Let G be the proportionality constant. Let n1, 
ns  be  the  number  of  nodes  reachable  when  the  node 
transmits  respectively  at  the  maximum  power  level  and 
at the lowest power level.  
We derive the delay for a simple scenario (Figure 1)
1 Other models for MAC layer delay have used higher powers 
of n,  or  exponential  function  of  n.  These  can  be  incorporated 
into  our  analysis  directly  with  just  replacement  of  the  MAC 
delay term(s) and this would bias the analysis and results more 
in favor of SPMS.

and then extend it to a more general scenario. Node A is 
the source node and sends the advertisement. 
4.1.1
Analysis of SPIN 
(a)  Failure  Free  Case: Let  Tb  be  the  time  for  B  to 
receive the data measured from the time (and including) 
A sending out the ADV. All the nodes are transmitting at 
their  single  maximum  power  level  with  a  transmission 
radius  of  n1  nodes.  There  are  transmission  delays 
associated with transmissions of ADV, REQ and DATA 
packets.  Also  there  is  processing  delays  at  B  for  ADV 
and at A for REQ. 
In  general:  Delay  for  any  transmission  =  Delay  due  to 
MAC  layer  contention  for  the  channel  +  Transmission 
delay of the packet + Processing delay

The  same  calculation  holds  for  C,  since  both  B  and  C 
request the data independently. 
(b)  Failure  Case: Consider  that  nodes  may  fail.    The 
time  window  for  failure  is  (0,Tb).  In  case  of  failure  of 
source node A, it is not able to transfer data to any of the 
nodes. Then the nodes, which have the data, re-advertise 
and  the  nodes  which  could  not  get  the  data  eventually 
get  the  data  from  them  but  it  is  not  possible  to  do  an 
analysis for this scenario as it depends upon the network 
topology. 
4.1.2
Analysis of SPMS 
(a) Failure-free case
We assume that in-order to get to B, A transmits at a 
lower  level  covering  only  a  radius  of  r2  which  has  n2
(<n1) nodes. The advertisement from A is at the highest 
power level as earlier.
