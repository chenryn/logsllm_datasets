### Definitions

**Pedigree:**
The validation of the composition and provenance of technologies, products, and services. For microelectronics, this includes the material composition of components. For software, it includes the composition of open-source and proprietary code, including the version of the component at a given point in time. Pedigrees enhance the assurance that the claims made by suppliers about the internal composition and provenance of their products, services, and technologies are accurate.

**Program Manager:**
See "System Owner."

**Provenance:**
[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5]

The portion of risk remaining after controls and countermeasures have been applied.

**Risk:**
[NIST SP 800-39]

**Supply Chain Risk Information:**
[FASCA]
Includes, but is not limited to, information that describes or identifies: (1) Functionality of covered articles, including access to data and information system privileges; (2) Information on the user environment where a covered article is used or installed; (3) The ability of the source to produce and deliver covered articles as expected (i.e., supply chain assurance); (4) Foreign control of, or influence over, the source (e.g., foreign ownership, personal and professional ties between the source and any foreign entity, legal regime of any foreign country in which the source is headquartered or conducts operations); (5) Implications to national security, homeland security, and/or national critical functions associated with use of the covered source; (6) Vulnerability of federal systems, programs, or facilities; (7) Market alternatives to the covered source; (8) Potential impact or harm caused by the possible loss, damage, or compromise of a product, material, or service to an organization’s operations or mission; (9) Likelihood of a potential impact or harm, or the exploitability of a system; (10) Security, authenticity, and integrity of covered articles and their supply and compilation chain; (11) Capacity to mitigate risks identified; (12) Credibility of and confidence in other supply chain risk information; (13) Any other information that would factor into an analysis of the security, integrity, resilience, quality, trustworthiness, or authenticity of covered articles or sources; (14) A summary of the above information and any other information determined to be relevant to the determination of supply chain risk.

**System:**
[NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, adapted]
A combination of interacting elements organized to achieve one or more stated purposes. There are many types of systems, including general and special-purpose information systems, command, control, and communication systems, crypto modules, central processing unit and graphics processor boards, industrial control systems, flight control systems, weapons, targeting, and fire control systems, medical devices and treatment systems, financial, banking, and merchandising transaction systems, and social networking systems. The interacting elements in the definition of a system include hardware, software, data, humans, processes, facilities, materials, and naturally occurring physical entities. System-of-systems is included in the definition of a system.
