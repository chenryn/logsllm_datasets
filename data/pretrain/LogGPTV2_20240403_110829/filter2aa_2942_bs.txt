pedigree 
The validation of the composition and provenance of 
technologies, products, and services is referred to as the 
pedigree. For microelectronics, this includes material 
composition of components. For software this includes the 
composition of open source and proprietary code, including 
the version of the component at a given point in time. 
Pedigrees increase the assurance that the claims suppliers 
assert about the internal composition and provenance of the 
products, services, and technologies they provide are valid.
