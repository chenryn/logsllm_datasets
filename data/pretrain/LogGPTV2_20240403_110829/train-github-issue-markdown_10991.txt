Hello,
I've just updated from 0.193.0 to 0.200.0 (on Debian Jessie).
When launched from the CLI, atom used to display the tree view of the current
(CLI) directory, it is not the case anymore.
On the first start, the tree view is closed. In order to display the tree view
of a given directory, you have to manually open a file contained into it. From
that moment on, no mater the (CLI) directory atom is launched from, it always
opens the tree view for the directory containing the latest opened file.
The only way to open a new directory in the tree view (from the GUI) is to
right click the current one, select "remove project folder" than open a file
contained into the desired directory.
Is it a bug or a feature? Is there any way to get the previous behavior back?
