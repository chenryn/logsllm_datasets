Subject: Issue with Tree View Behavior After Upgrading to Atom 0.200.0

Hello,

I recently upgraded from Atom version 0.193.0 to 0.200.0 on Debian Jessie, and I have encountered a change in the behavior of the tree view when launching Atom from the command line interface (CLI).

Previously, Atom would display the tree view of the current CLI directory upon launch. However, this is no longer the case. Now, on the first start, the tree view is closed. To display the tree view for a specific directory, you must manually open a file within that directory. From that point onward, regardless of the CLI directory from which Atom is launched, it always opens the tree view for the directory containing the most recently opened file.

The only way to open a new directory in the tree view (from the graphical user interface) is to right-click the current directory, select "Remove Project Folder," and then open a file contained in the desired directory.

Is this a bug or an intentional feature? Is there any way to revert to the previous behavior?

Thank you,
