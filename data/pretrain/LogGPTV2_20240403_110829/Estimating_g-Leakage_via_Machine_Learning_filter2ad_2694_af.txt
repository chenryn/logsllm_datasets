First, let us call σ
which follows from the triangular inequality.
2 the worst case variance defined above which,
according to Popoviciu’s inequality is upper-bounded by pb´aq2{4.
Second, let us consider that one main advantage of deriving bounds
from Bernstein’s inequality is that it allows allow the upper-bound
in eq. (35) grows as expp´nεq instead of expp´nε

over eq. (46) is upper-bounded by 2 expp´n ε2{2σ 2`2pb´aqε{3q. This
