I'd like to add a method to `os/exec.Cmd` to ease setting environment
variables on commands before they're run.
Manipulating `Env []string` lists is tedious and error-prone, especially
considering potential duplicates. (since programs would others choose either
the first or last occurrence, unpredictably)
The proposed `Cmd.SetEnv(key, value string)` method would be documented as
removing duplicates.
On Windows, environment variables are case-insensitive, so the method on
Windows should de-dup case insensitively.
This method would replace a handful of copies of `func mergeEnvLists` that
exist in various forms around the standard library, tests, and x/* repos.
