### Unintended Consequences: Four Years Under the DMCA

#### 1. Executive Summary
Since its enactment in 1998, the "anti-circumvention" provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), codified in Section 1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as Congress intended. The primary goal was to prevent copyright piracy by stopping the defeat of anti-piracy protections and banning "black box" devices designed for such purposes.

In practice, however, these provisions have been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities, rather than to combat piracy. As a result, the DMCA has become a significant threat to three important public policy priorities:

- **Chilling Free Expression and Scientific Research:** Section 1201 has been used to suppress free speech and scientific research. Notable examples include the lawsuit against 2600 magazine, threats against Princeton Professor Edward Felten’s research team, and the prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov. These actions have had a chilling effect on journalists, publishers, scientists, students, programmers, and the general public.
  
- **Jeopardizing Fair Use:** By prohibiting all acts of circumvention and the tools that enable it, Section 1201 grants copyright owners the power to unilaterally eliminate fair use rights. For instance, the music industry has started using "copy-protected CDs" that limit consumers' ability to make legitimate, personal copies of music they have purchased.

- **Impeding Competition and Innovation:** Instead of focusing on pirates, many copyright owners have used the DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. Sony, for example, has invoked Section 1201 to protect its monopoly on PlayStation video game consoles and to enforce regional restrictions, limiting users in one country from playing games legitimately purchased in another.

This document compiles several reported cases where the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA have been invoked against consumers, scientists, and legitimate competitors. It will be updated periodically as new cases emerge. The latest version can always be found at [www.eff.org](http://www.eff.org).

#### 2. Legislative Background
Congress enacted Section 1201 in response to two main pressures:
- Implementing obligations under the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty.
- Addressing concerns from copyright owners about widespread piracy in the digital age.

Section 1201 includes two distinct prohibitions:
- A ban on acts of circumventing technological measures used by copyright owners to control access to their works (Section 1201(a)(1)).
- A ban on the manufacture, sale, distribution, or trafficking of tools and technologies that enable circumvention (Sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b)).

These provisions apply even if the purpose of the circumvention is otherwise legitimate. For example, decrypting a DVD movie to fast-forward through commercials is illegal under this section.

Additionally, Section 1201 includes exceptions for certain limited activities, such as security testing, reverse engineering, encryption research, and law enforcement. However, these exceptions have been criticized as being too narrow to be effective.

#### 3. Free Expression and Scientific Research
Section 1201 has been used by copyright owners to stifle free speech and legitimate scientific research. Examples include:
- **Threats Against Professor Felten's Research Team:** In September 2000, the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) issued a challenge to defeat certain watermarking technologies. When a team led by Princeton Professor Edward Felten succeeded, SDMI representatives threatened them with DMCA liability. This forced the researchers to withdraw their paper from an academic conference.
- **Hewlett-Packard Threatens SNOsoft:** Researchers who discovered a security flaw in HP’s Tru64 UNIX operating system were threatened with DMCA action after publishing their findings.
- **Censorware Research Obstructed:** Benjamin Edelman, who conducts research on "censorware" software, faced potential DMCA liability for his efforts to analyze N2H2’s list of blocked websites.
- **Dmitry Sklyarov Arrested:** Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov was arrested and detained for five months in the U.S. for working on a software tool that allowed owners of Adobe e-books to convert them into PDF files, thereby removing embedded restrictions.

These incidents have led to a chilling effect on research and innovation. Many security researchers are now hesitant to publish their findings, and some have chosen to forgo further research in this field due to the fear of legal repercussions.

#### 4. Implications and Consequences
The misuse of Section 1201 has resulted in weakened security for all computer users, including copyright owners who rely on technical measures to protect their works. Security researchers are increasingly wary of conducting research that might run afoul of the DMCA.

For example, prominent cryptographer Niels Ferguson declined to publish his findings on a major security flaw in Intel's HDCP system due to fear of DMCA liability. Other experts, such as Fred Cohen and Dug Song, have also removed content from their websites for similar reasons.

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has also grappled with the implications of the DMCA. In November 2001, the IEEE required authors to indemnify the organization for any liabilities incurred under the DMCA. After an outcry from members, the IEEE revised its policies, but the issue remains a sensitive topic.

These developments highlight the need for reform to ensure that the DMCA does not unduly restrict legitimate activities and innovation while still protecting copyright holders' interests.
