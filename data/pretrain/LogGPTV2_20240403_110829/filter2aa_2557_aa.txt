Unintended Consequences:  
Four Years under the DMCA 
1. Executive Summary 
Since they were enacted in 1998, the “anti-
circumvention” provisions of the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act (“DMCA”), codified in section 1201 of 
the Copyright Act, have not been used as Congress 
envisioned. Congress meant to stop copyright pirates 
from defeating anti-piracy protections added to 
copyrighted works, and to ban “black box” devices 
intended for that purpose.1  
In practice, the anti-circumvention provisions have 
been used to stifle a wide array of legitimate activities, 
rather than to stop copyright piracy. As a result, the 
DMCA has developed into a serious threat to three 
important public policy priorities: 
Section 1201 Chills Free Expression and 
Scientific Research.  
Experience with section 1201 demonstrates 
that it is being used to stifle free speech and 
scientific research. The lawsuit against 2600 
magazine, threats against Princeton Professor 
Edward Felten’s team of researchers, and 
prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry 
Sklyarov have chilled the legitimate activities 
of journalists, publishers, scientists, students, 
programmers, and members of the public.  
Section 1201 Jeopardizes Fair Use.  
By banning all acts of circumvention, and all 
technologies and tools that can be used for 
circumvention, 
section 
1201 
grants 
to 
copyright owners the power to unilaterally 
eliminate the public’s fair use rights. Already, 
the music industry has begun deploying 
“copy-protected CDs” that promise to curtail 
consumers’ 
ability 
to 
make 
legitimate, 
personal copies of music they have purchased.  
Section 1201 Impedes Competition and 
Innovation. 
Rather than focusing on pirates, many 
copyright owners have chosen to use the 
DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. 
For example, Sony has invoked section 1201 
to protect their monopoly on Playstation 
video game consoles, as well as their 
“regionalization” system limiting users in one 
country from playing games legitimately 
purchased in another. 
This document collects a number of reported cases 
where the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA 
have been invoked not against pirates, but against 
consumers, scientists, and legitimate competitors. It 
will be updated from time to time as additional cases 
come to light. The latest version can always be obtained 
at www.eff.org. 
2. DMCA Legislative Background 
Congress enacted section 1201 in response to two 
pressures. First, Congress was responding to the 
perceived need to implement obligations imposed on 
the U.S. by the 1996 World Intellectual Property Or-
ganization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty. Section 1201, 
however, went further than the WIPO treaty required.2 
The details of section 1201, then, were a response not 
just to U.S. treaty obligations, but also to the concerns 
of copyright owners that their works would be widely 
pirated in the networked digital world.3 
Section 1201 contains two distinct prohibitions: a 
ban on acts of circumvention, as well as a ban on the 
distribution of tools and technologies used for circumvention.  
The first prohibition, set out in section 1201(a)(1), 
prohibits the act of circumventing a technological 
measure used by copyright owners to control access to 
their works (“access controls”). So, for example, this 
provision makes it unlawful to defeat the encryption 
system used on DVD movies. This ban on acts of 
circumvention applies even where the purpose for 
decrypting the movie would otherwise be legitimate. As 
a result, when Disney’s Tarzan DVD prevents you from 
fast-forwarding through the commercials that preface 
the feature presentation, efforts to circumvent this 
restriction would be unlawful.  
Second, sections 1201(a)(2) and 1201(b) outlaw the 
manufacture, sale, distribution or trafficking of tools and 
technologies that make circumvention possible. These 
provisions ban not only technologies that defeat access 
controls, but also technologies that defeat use 
restrictions imposed by copyright owners, such as copy

controls. These provisions prevent technology vendors 
from taking steps to defeat the “copy-protection” now 
appearing on many music CDs, for example.

Network Security,” The Boston Globe, October

Section 1201 also includes a number of exceptions 
for certain limited classes of activities, including 
security testing, reverse engineering of software, 
encryption research, and law enforcement. These 
exceptions have been extensively criticized as being too 
narrow to be of real use to the constituencies who they 
were intended to assist.4  
Professor Felten’s Research Team Threatened 
In September 2000, a multi-industry group known as 
the Secure Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) issued a 
public challenge encouraging skilled technologists to try 
to defeat certain watermarking technologies intended to 
protect digital music. Princeton Professor Edward 
Felten and a team of researchers at Princeton, Rice, and 
Xerox took up the challenge and succeeded in 
removing the watermarks.  
A violation of any of the “act” or “tools” 
prohibitions is subject to significant civil and, in some 
circumstances, criminal penalties.  
When the team tried to present their results at an 
academic conference, however, SDMI representatives 
threatened the researchers with liability under the 
DMCA. The threat letter was also delivered to the 
researchers’ employers, as well as the conference 
organizers. After extensive discussions with counsel, 
the researchers grudgingly withdrew their paper from 
the conference. The threat was ultimately withdrawn 
and a portion of the research published at a subsequent 
conference, but only after the researchers filed a lawsuit 
in federal court.  
3. Free Expression and Scientific Research 
Section 1201 is being used by a number of copyright 
owners to stifle free speech and legitimate scientific 
research. The lawsuit against 2600 magazine, threats 
against Princeton Professor Edward Felten’s team of 
researchers, 
and 
prosecution 
of 
the 
Russian 
programmer Dmitry Sklyarov have imposed a chill on a 
variety of legitimate activities.  
For example, online service providers and bulletin 
board operators have begun to censor discussions of 
copy-protection systems, programmers have removed 
computer security programs from their websites, and 
students, scientists and security experts have stopped 
publishing details of their research on existing security 
protocols. Foreign scientists are also increasingly 
uneasy about traveling to the United States out of fear 
of possible DMCA liability, and certain technical 
conferences have begun to relocate overseas.  
After enduring this experience, at least one of the 
researchers involved has decided to forgo further 
research efforts in this field.

These developments will ultimately result in 
weakened security for all computer users (including, 
ironically, for copyright owners counting on technical 
measures to protect their works), as security researchers 
shy away from research that might run afoul of section

Hewlett Packard Threatens SNOsoft 
Cyber-Security Czar Notes Chill on Research 
Hewlett-Packard resorted to Section 1201 threats 
when researchers published their discovery of a security 
flaw in HP’s Tru64 UNIX operating system. The 
researchers, a loosely-organized collective known as 
Secure Network Operations (“SNOsoft”), received the 
DMCA threat after releasing software in July 2002 that 
demonstrated vulnerabilities that HP had been aware of 
for some time, but had not bothered to fix. 
Speaking at MIT in October 2002, White House 
Cyber Security Chief Richard Clarke called for DMCA 
reform, noting his concern that the DMCA had been 
used to chill legitimate computer security research. The 
Boston Globe quoted Clarke as saying, “I think a lot of 
people didn't realize that it would have this potential 
chilling effect on vulnerability research.” 
After the DMCA threat received widespread press 
attention, HP ultimately withdrew the threat. Security 
researchers received the message, however—publish 
vulnerability research at your own risk.

Censorware Research Obstructed 
Benjamin 
Edelman 
conducts 
research 
on 
“censorware” software (i.e., programs that block 
websites that contain objectionable material), working 
to document flaws in such software, including in the 
products of N2H2, a leading censorware company. 
Edelman’s research led to his providing expert 
testimony for the ACLU in a recent federal court case 
challenging the constitutionality of the Children's 
Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which mandates that 
public libraries use censorware products like those sold 
by N2H2. 
In the course of his work for the ACLU, Edelman 
discovered that the DMCA might interfere with his 
efforts to learn what websites are actually blocked by 
NH2H products. N2H2 claims that its encrypted list of 
blocked websites is legally protected by the DMCA 
against attempts to read and analyze it. Because he is 
not willing to risk civil and criminal penalties under 
Section 1201, Edelman has been forced to go to federal 
court to clarify his legal rights before he can undertake 
his legitimate research.

Dmitry Sklyarov Arres ed 
t
In July 2001, Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov 
was jailed for several weeks and detained for five 
months in the United States after speaking at the 
DEFCON conference in Las Vegas.  
Prosecutors, prompted by software goliath Adobe 
Systems Inc., alleged that Sklyarov had worked on a 
software program known as the Advanced e-Book 
Processor, which was distributed over the Internet by 
his Russian employer, ElcomSoft Co. Ltd. The 
software allowed owners of Adobe electronic books 
(“e-books”) to convert them from Adobe’s e-Book 
format into Adobe Portable Document Format (“pdf”) 
files, thereby removing restrictions embedded into the 
files by e-Book publishers.  
Sklyarov was never accused of infringing any 
copyrighted e-Book, nor of assisting anyone else to 
infringe copyrights. His alleged crime was working on a 
software tool with many legitimate uses, simply because 
third parties he has never met might use the tool to 
copy an e-Book without the publisher’s permission.  
The Department of Justice ultimately permitted 
Sklyarov to return home, but elected to proceed against 
his employer, ElcomSoft, under the criminal provisions 
of the DMCA. In December 2002, a jury acquitted 
Elcomsoft of all charges, completing an 18-month 
ordeal for the wrongly-accused Russian software 
company.

Scientists and Programmers Withhold Research 
Following the legal threat against Professor Felten’s 
research team and the arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov, a 
number of prominent computer security experts have 
curtailed their legitimate research activities out of fear 
of potential DMCA liability.  
For example, prominent Dutch cryptographer and 
security systems analyst Niels Ferguson discovered a 
major security flaw in an Intel video encryption system 
known as High Bandwidth Digital Content Protection 
(HDCP). He declined to publish his results on his 
website relating to flaws in HDCP, on the grounds that 
he travels frequently to the U.S. and is fearful of 
“prosecution and/or liability under the U.S. DMCA 
law.”

Following the arrest of Dmitry Sklyarov, Fred 
Cohen, a professor of digital forensics and respected 
security consultant, removed his “Forensix” evidence-
gathering software from his website, citing fear of 
potential DMCA liability.  
Another respected network security protection 
expert, Dug Song, also removed content from his 
website for the same reason. Mr. Song is the author of

several security papers, including a paper describing a 
common vulnerability in many firewalls.  
IEEE Wrestles with DMCA 
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
(IEEE), which publishes 30 per cent of all computer 
science journals worldwide, recently was drawn into the 
controversy surrounding science and the DMCA. 
Apparently concerned about possible liability  under 
Section 1201, the IEEE in November 2001 instituted a 
policy requiring all authors to indemnify IEEE for any 
liabilities incurred should a submission result in legal 
action under the DCMA.

Law Stifles,” CNET NEWS, Sept. 6, 2001.

In mid-2001 an anonymous programmer discovered 
a vulnerability in Microsoft’s proprietary e-Book digital 
rights management code, but refused to publish the 
results, citing DMCA liability concerns.  
After an outcry from IEEE members, the 
organization ultimately revised its submission policies, 
removing mention of the DMCA. According to Bill 
Hagen, manager of IEEE Intellectual Property Rights, 
“The Digital Millennium Copyright Act has become a 
very sensitive subject among our authors. It’s intended
