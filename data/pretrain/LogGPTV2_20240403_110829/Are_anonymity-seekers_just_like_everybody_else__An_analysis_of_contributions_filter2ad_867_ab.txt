reach a consensus to form a network. Once a consensus is
reached, the exit nodes become effective at the time indicated
by the directory authorities. This consensus-building process
can happen several hours before the exit list is updated.
As a result, the use of both the consensus and the exit lists
is necessary to identify a comprehensive list of exit nodes
because sometimes nodes that do not meet the criteria for
an exit ﬂag (an identiﬁer ﬂagged by the dedicated server to
indicate that a relay is qualiﬁed to be an exit node) end up
becoming exit nodes anyway due to their exit policy (a set
of rules set up by the owner of the relay to dictate how the
relay should be operated) [21]. Our dataset of Tor exit nodes
reﬂects a comprehensive set of all exit nodes drawn from both
these sources with the speciﬁc time periods that the nodes were
active.
We crosschecked the IP address and timestamp for every
contribution credited to an IP address on Wikipedia to identify
any edit from a Tor exit node IP within a period that the node
was active. The IP addresses of users who are logged into
accounts are not retained by the Wikimedia Foundation for
more than a short period of time and are never made public.
As a result, we could not identify edits made by registered
Wikipedia users using Tor. Finally, we queried the timestamps
of the identiﬁed revisions in the Tor relay search tool called
ExoneraTor to verify that the IP addresses were indeed active
exit nodes around the same time. We extracted and found a
total of 11,363 edits on English Wikipedia made by Tor users
between 2007 (the earliest available Tor consensus data) and
March 2018 when our Wikipedia database dump was created.
Fig. 2 displays the number of Tor edits to English Wikipedia
per month over time. The spikes in the graph suggest that there
were occasions when Wikipedia failed to ban exit nodes and
Tor revisions were able to slip through. These larger spikes
appear at least ﬁve times in the graph before late 2013, when
the edit trend ﬁnally died down and failed to rise back up
again. We have posted the full dataset of Tor edits to Wikipedia
and the code we used to conduct these analyses in a repository
posted to the Harvard Dataverse where they will be available
by request.13
B. How Wikipedia blocked Tor over time
To better understand why Tor users were able to edit
Wikipedia at certain times but not others, we examined the
history of Wikipedia’s Tor blocking and banning mechanisms.
We found that there are two ways Wikipedia members prevent
Tor users from editing: (1) blocking the IP address using the
TorBlock14 extension for MediaWiki, the software that was
installed on the servers that run Wikipedia, and (2) banning
by blacklisting individual exit node IP addresses in a piece-
meal process conducted by individual administrators and bots
on Wikipedia. In 2008, Wikipedia started using the TorBlock
extension to block Tor. TorBlock is a script that “automatically

applies restrictions to Tor exit node’s access to the wiki’s
front-door server.” This extension preemptively limits access
from all active Tor nodes by pulling the current exit
list
published by Tor, as described in §IV-A. One beneﬁt of using
TorBlock is that only active Tor exit nodes are prevented
from creating accounts and editing. As soon as IP addresses
stop volunteering as Tor exit nodes, they are restored to full
access by TorBlock. However, as described by a Wikipedia
administrator, the TorBlock extension did not seem to work
well initially and also went down occasionally.15 As a result,
Wikipedia administrators continued to issue bans manually and
relied on bots to catch Tor nodes that were able to slip through.
Using publicly available data that Wikipedia maintains on
bans, we traced the list of banned Tor IPs from 2007 to 2018.
Wikipedia’s block log provides details about the timestamp of
each ban action, the enforcer’s username, the duration of the
ban, and optional comment justifying bans. Unsurprisingly,
most IPs in this list are described as being banned simply
because they are Tor exit nodes. Table I provides an overview
of the ban actions against Tor IP addresses over the course of
11 years. There were a total of 45,130 ban actions against
IP addresses that were used as Tor exit nodes during this
period. Roughly 11% of these bans were against Tor IPs
that successfully made at least one edit. Ban actions executed
before a single edit took place suggest that many IP addresses
were preemptively banned by Wikipedia. We found that less
than 2% of the ban actions explicitly state that they are due to
vandalism. On the other hand, 77.1% of the actions mention
the word “Tor.” These statistics provide both a picture of
Wikipedia’s policy in relation to anonymity-seeking users and
a validation of our methodology for identifying Tor edits.
Bans on Wikipedia can be issued by either administrators
or bots. Our data on ban actions shows that, initially, Tor
IP bans were mainly handled by administrators with 95.9%
of 7,852 ban actions issued by administrators from 2007 to
2009. Bans during this period were typically 1–5 years in
duration. However, IP addresses typically spend only a short
period of time volunteering as Tor exit nodes.16 Banning these
IPs for extended periods of time prevented these addresses
from editing on Wikipedia even when they were no longer Tor
nodes. From 2010 to early 2014, Wikipedia started employing
bots to automatically spot and blacklist Tor nodes. During this

period, the typical ban duration was reduced to two weeks.
Although many exit nodes were only active for a portion of
this ban period, some large nodes were active for much longer.
In some cases, bans expired while a node was still active and,
as a result, we found many nodes were banned multiple times
with multiple edits made between bans.
Additionally, Tor users frequently slipped past Wikipedia’s
TorBlock in systematic ways that appear to explain the sharp
drop in the number of Tor edits from 2007 to 2009 and
frequent spikes in edits from 2010 to 2013. A Wikipedia
administrator explained that the TorBlock tool only checked
for the current list of Tor nodes, but when some of them
were shut off abruptly, their server descriptors were no longer
published on the exit list.17 If the IP addresses were then
reused as Tor nodes, they did not reappear on the list for some
time and escaped the TorBlock extension’s notice. As a result,
the admin wrote an automated tool named TorNodeBot to spot
and ban any Tor node with access to Wikipedia editing.18
TorNodeBot was active from 2010 to 2014 and is recorded to
have issued 32,123 bans on 21,837 different Tor IP addresses
during this period.
The deactivation of TorNodeBot in early 2014, along with
the signiﬁcant drop of Tor edits and banning actions against
Tor nodes, suggests that the TorBlock extension started work-
ing as intended at this point in time. Only 562 edits were
made by Tor users after 2013. We suspect that these edits are
allowed because TorBlock must periodically pull the currently
active exit list from Tor, which leaves a time gap when freshly
activated nodes are not caught by the tool.
V. STATISTICAL COMPARISON OF TOR EDITS TO OTHER
GROUPS OF USERS
In addition to our dataset of Tor edits, we developed datasets
from three comparison groups—IP editors, First-time editors,
and Registered editors. IP editors are not
logged into an
account so that their edits are credited to their actual (i.e.,
non-Tor) IP address. The second group includes registered
editors making their ﬁrst contribution. The third group includes
registered users who have made more than one edit before the
edit in question. For each of these populations, we cannot
know if the people editing have other accounts or if they have
contributed from other IP addresses. We randomly picked the
same number of revisions from each group, time-matched with
the original dataset, by determining the number of edits made
each month by Tor users and then randomly picking the same
number of edits made by each comparison group within the
same month.
To assess the quality of contributions, we used several
measures of quality that were developed within the Wikipedia
community and by social computing researchers. Before ex-
amining the quality of these edits, however, it is important
to note that not all Wikipedia pages serve the same purpose.
Although article pages are the most visible, Wikipedia con-
tains many other pages devoted to discussion, coordination,
user proﬁles, policy, and more. While Wikipedia has strict
guidelines about editing article pages, other types of pages
tend to have more relaxed standards.19 Although sections §V-A
and the analysis of reverts in §V-D uses data drawn from
contributions to all types of pages, the rest of our analysis
is restricted to edits made to article pages (called “namespace
0” pages in Wikipedia). We focused our analysis on article
pages for two reasons. First, article production is the primary
work of the Wikipedia community, and contributions here
have the potential to be of the greatest value. Second, the
nature of article contributions lend themselves to large-scale
computational analysis better than discussions about policy
and social interactions that require substantial interpretation in
order to be assessed for value. In addition, the current version
of TorBlock (and other forms of blocks and bans used in the
past) permit IP addresses to edit their own user talk pages in
order to allow them to contact administrators and appeal their
ban. These pages are therefore not included in our analyses.
It is important to note that the distribution of edits across
namespaces is different across the four comparison groups. For
example, Tor editors make a larger proportion of contributions
to article pages than Registered users. The distribution of edits
across namespaces is available in the Appendix (Fig. 7).
Because the number of contributions to Wikipedia from Tor
shrank drastically by the end of 2013, we divided and observed
the edits in two separate periods from 2007 to 2013 and from
2013 to 2018. Because §V-A through §V-C are focused on
identifying trends over time, we limit our analysis to the pre-
2013 datasets where data is more dense. We replicated and
compared results from §V-A through §V-C in the 2013–2018
data which we report on in §V-D. In all other sections, we
conducted analyses using the full 2007–2018 dataset.
A. Measuring contribution quality using reversion rates
The most widely used method for measuring edit quality in
Wikipedia is whether an edit has been reverted. In Wikipedia,
a contribution is said to be reverted if a subsequent edit returns
a page to a state that is identical to a point in time prior to
the edit in question and if the reverting edit is not reverted
itself. Because the term “revert” can be used in a more general
sense, these are sometimes called “identity reverts.” Because
reverting is the main way that Wikipedia editors respond to
low-quality contributions and vandalism [22], the reversion
rate can provide insight into how valuable the efforts of an
editor are perceived to be by the Wikipedia community.
We used a Python library called mwreverts20 to detect
whether or not a revision was subsequently reverted by some-
one else and whether or not an edit was was a revert action
itself undoing other revisions. We examine the reversion rate
of each set of edits in our comparison groups—both overall

likely to be reverted and that registered users were almost three
times more likely to revert another user as IP editors. We found
that the latter is not the case for Tor editors. As illustrated
in Table II, we found that Tor users, similar to Registered
users, are much more likely than IP editors to revert others.
Although Tor users are still statistically less likely to revert
edits than Registered users (z = −5.19, p < 0.01), less than
one third of their revert actions are allowed to stand by the
Wikipedia community. This paints a stark contrast with the
other groups whose revert actions are all much more likely to
be kept. Overall, Tor editors revert others more frequently but
less effectively. This points to an important difference in the
behavior of Tor users and our comparison groups. When we
excluded these cases of reverted reverts, Tor edits are much
more likely to be kept. Indeed, non-reverts by Tor users are
accepted at a rate that is comparable to First-time editors
(z = −1.44; p = 0.15).
A deeper look into Tor revert actions reveals additional
insights. First, Tor users are more likely to revert edits to
non-articles. 28.2% of Tor users’ revert actions focus on non-
article namespace articles while less than 12% of revert actions
from other groups do so. Tor users’ reverts to non-articles are
themselves reverted 85.16% of the time. We also ﬁnd that these
revert actions primarily target Talk pages, such as Article Talk
pages, and User Talk pages.
Research by Yaserri et al. has shown that a “considerable
portion of talk pages are dedicated to discussions about
removed materials and controversial edits” [39]. These discus-
sions often resulted in extended back and forth between those
editors who rarely change their opinion and can often lead to
“edit wars.” An edit war happens when “editors who disagree
about the content of a page repeatedly override each other’s
contributions,” changing the content of the page back and forth
between versions [4].22 In November 2004, the Wikipedia
community issued a guideline known as the three-revert rule
(3RR), which prohibits an editor from performing “more than
three reverts, in whole or in part, whether involving the same
or different material, on a single page within a 24-hour period.”
Anyone who violates this rule is at risk of being banned by
Wikipedia administrators. In this way, the 3RR creates an
incentive to seek anonymity.
To identify edit wars and violations of the 3RR, we exam-
ined the revision history of Tor edits in chronological order.
We excluded self-revert actions because reverting one’s own
edit is allowed. Among 1,577 Tor revert actions, we found 30
3RR violations with a total of 180 revert actions made across
30 different articles. While the edit wars in our dataset rarely
lasted more than several days and most of these violations
did not last long before the Tor IP addresses were banned,
this analysis provides evidence that Tor was used to engage
in edit warring in violation of Wikipedia policy. We further
reviewed these reverts and found that 56% of the 180 edits
are made on User Talk pages. A common pattern involved

(2008–2013).
and by year. Fig. 3 plots how the reversion rate of article
pages changes over time for each group of editors. Overall,
41.12% of Tor edits on article pages are reverted, while only
30.3% of IP edits, 35.2% of First-time edits, and 5.5% of
Registered edits are reverted. A proportional z-test shows that
the reversion rate of Tor edits is signiﬁcantly higher than the
closest group, First-time edits (z = 11.53; p < 0.01).21 These
numbers are similar for the reversion rates across all edits
(special namespace articles included): 42.0% for Tor edits,
29.61% for IP edits, 34.3% for First-time edits, and 4.84%
for Registered edits.
Reversion rate might be a biased measure of quality because
good quality edits made via Tor might be reverted simply
because they violate Wikipedia’s policy blocking Tor. To
assess whether this is in some cases true, one of the authors
examined the 4,972 instances in which a Tor-based editor’s
work was reverted and hand coded the “edit summaries”
left behind by the person performing the reversion. In 2,848
instances (57.3% of the cases), no edit summary was entered as
