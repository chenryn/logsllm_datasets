NotableQuotesonCloud Computing
re are some notable quotes on cloud computing.
*First to mind when asked what 'the cloud’' is, a majority respond it's
either an actual cloud, the sky, or something related to weather.
 Citrix Cloud Survey Guide (August 2012)
“I don’t need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server
faster... carrying around these non-connected computers is byzantine by
comparison.
 Steve Jobs, late chairman of Apple
“Cloud is about how you do computing, not where you do computing.
 Paul Maritz, VMware CEO
“Every kid coming out of Harvard, every kid coming out of school
now thinks he can be the next Mark Zuckerberg, and with these new
technologies like cloud computing, he actually has a shot.
 Marc Andreessen, Board Member of Facebook
"We believe we're moving out of the Ice Age, the Iron Age, the
Incdustrial Age, the Information Age, to the participation age. You get
on the Net and you do stuff. You IM (instant message), you blog, you
take pictures, you publish, you podcast, you transact, you distance
learn, you telemedicine. You are participating on the Internet, not just
viewing stuff. We build the infrastructure that goes in the data center
that facilitates the participation age. We build that big friggin’ Webtone
switch. It has security, directory, identity, privacy, storage, compute, the

whole Web services stack.
 Scott McNealy, forme
"Cloud computing is often far more secure than traditional computing.
bccause companies like Google and Amazon can attract and retain cyber-
security personnel of a higher quality than many governmental agencies.
 Vivek Kundra, former federal CIO of the United States
"There was a time when every household, town, farm or village had its
own water well. Today, shared public utilities give us access to clean water
by simply turning on the tap; cloud computing works in a similar fashion
Just like water from the tap in your kitchen, cloud computing services can
be turned on or off quickly as needed. Like at the water company, there is
a team of dedicated professionals making sure the service provided is safe,
secure and available on a 24/7 basis. When the tap isn’t on, not only are you
saving water, but you aren't paying for resources you don't currently need.
 Vivek Kundra, former feceral CIO of the United States.
"The interesting thing about cloud computing is that we’ve redefined
cloud computing to include everything that we already do. I can’t think
of anything that isn’t cloud computing with all of these announcements.
The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-clriven
than women’s fashion. Maybe I'm an idiot, but I have no idea what
anyone is talking about. What is it? It's complete gibberish. It's insane,
When is this idiocy going to stop?"
 Larry Ellison, chairman, Oracle
*If you think you’ve scen this movie before, you are right. Cloud
computing is based on the time-sharing model we leveraged years
ago before we could afford our own computers, The idea is to share
computing power among many companies and people, thereby
reducing the cost of that computing power to those who leverage it. The
value of time share and the core value of cloud computing are pretty
much the same, only the resources these days are much better and more
cost effcctive.
 David Linthicum
