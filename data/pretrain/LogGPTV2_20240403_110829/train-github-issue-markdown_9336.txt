According to the documents, as well as the behavior of previous versions,
`JULIA_LOAD_PATH` shall append to `LOAD_PATH` instead of replace it, however,
with Julia 1.0.1, this is not the case. Below is a minimal example,
(`julia-1.0` is just an alias to my Juila 1.0.1 installation, I have multiple
versions on the system).
    $ julia-1.0 -e '@show LOAD_PATH'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
    LOAD_PATH = ["@", "@v#.#", "@stdlib"]
    $ JULIA_LOAD_PATH=/usr/local/julia julia-1.0 -e '@show LOAD_PATH'
    LOAD_PATH = ["/usr/local/julia"]
