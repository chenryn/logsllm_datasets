towards v. More formally, a vertex w ∈ Nu,v if and only if, the
edge (u, w) starts a path from u to v.
DEFINITION 1. Let G(V, E) be a graph and S ((cid:54)= ∅) and P
subsets of V denoting sets of sources and destinations respectively.
For each pair (d, d(cid:48)) ∈ P × P we deﬁne the Multiple next-hop
228Routing State Distance (M RSD) over S by
(cid:80)

(cid:48)

where δs(d, d(cid:48)) = 1 − J(Ns,d, Ns,d(cid:48) ) and J(A, B) denotes the
Jaccard Index of any pair of sets A and B.

,
The intuition behind MRSD is that when M RSD(d, d(cid:48)) is close
to 0 then d and d(cid:48) are very similar in terms of the next-hop choices
made by all nodes in the set S. On the other hand, when M RSD
approaches 1 we have that those destinations are routed very dif-
ferently through the network. Note that MRSD is always a value
between 0 and 1, and it can be interpreted as the fraction of next-
hop decisions that differ, across all nodes in the network. It is also
important to remark that when all destinations always have unique
next-hops (|Ns,d| = 1 for all s and d), this deﬁnition is equivalent
to the one presented in [7], and so in that case MRSD reduces to
(normalized) RSD.
3.2 Temporal MRSD
Next we show how to apply the deﬁnition of the last section in
the context of interdomain routing on the Internet in order to con-
duct a longitudinal analysis.
Consider P and S being respectively a set of IP preﬁxes
{p1, . . . , p|P|} and sources (autonomous systems) {s1, . . . , s|S|}
on the Internet seen by a set of monitors at times t1, . . . , tT
(ti − ti−1 > 0 for i = 2, . . . , T ). We deﬁne Ns,p(t) as the set
of next-hops (autonomous systems) that source s may use at time t
in order to reach preﬁx p, where p ∈ P , s ∈ S and t = ti for some
i ∈ {1, . . . , T}.
DEFINITION 2. For a preﬁx p we deﬁne the Temporal multiple
next-hop Routing State Distance (TRSD) over a set of sources S
between time ti and tj (1 ≤ i  0). Table 1 shows the intermediate computations
for TRSD over the set S = {a, b, c, d, e, f}.
From Table 1 we have that |Dp(ti, ti+n)| = 5 and as conse-
quence T RSDp(ti, ti+n) = 0.283. This can be interpreted as
saying that from time ti to ti+n, the network’s next-hop decisions
changed 28.3% with regard to p. It is important to remark that, in
this example, the last row (related to the source f) did not con-
tribute anything to TRSD (because it was not considered in the
composition of the set Dp(ti, ti+n) and δf,p(ti, ti+n) = 0). This
shows an important aspect of our deﬁnition, i.e., TRSD was de-
signed with the intention of capturing routing changes, and hence
does not increase simply due to the growth of the network.

4. DATASET DESCRIPTION
To explore the evolution of Internet routing over time, we col-
lected four datasets comprising Routing Information Bases (RIBs)
from RIPE [1] and Route Views [2]. Datasets 1, 2 and 3 consist
of all RIBs on a daily basis for the entire years of 2005, 2008 and
2011 respectively. The fourth data set consists of all RIBSs for the
ﬁrst day of each month from 2005 to 2012. Since RIBs are made
available at a coarser granularity than BGP updates (every 2 hours
for Route Views and 8 hours for RIPE) we did not attempt to re-
move the effects of short term convergences, i.e., for each day, we
kept all available distinct AS paths. It is important to remark that
we collected data only for IPv4 preﬁxes.
Each RIB is a collection of records containing information about
how to reach a preﬁx p from a speciﬁc autonomous system. From
these records we extracted the following information: route dump-
ing date, autonomous system path a0, a1, . . . , ar (r ≥ 1) and des-
tination preﬁx p, hosted in the AS ar. After that we decomposed
each record into r 4-tuples of the form [route dumping date, ai,
ai+1, p], for i = 0, . . . , r − 1. The semantics of each 4-tuple is: at
the time of route dumping date, in order to reach the preﬁx p, AS
ai uses AS ai+1 as (one of its) next-hops. In the rest of the paper,
AS ai will be referred to as a source, preﬁx p will be referred to as
a destination, and AS ai+1 will be referred to as a next-hop.
To apply the deﬁnitions presented in Section 3 to this data, S is
the set of all sources (ai) and P is the set of all preﬁxes (p) found in
a dataset. Table 2 presents a summary of each dataset collected af-
ter transformation into a collection of 4-tuples as described above.

To see the need for using Jaccard Index in Deﬁnitions 1 and 2,
we note that, in our dataset on each day, approximately 7% of the
sources have more than one next-hop choice towards a speciﬁc pre-
ﬁx.

In this section we show how TRSD can be used to extract useful
knowledge about interdomain routing dynamics.
5.1 Analyzing TRSD
To analyze routing dynamics in the four datasets we compute
time series of TRSD, averaged over all preﬁxes. Speciﬁcally, let
rp(i, n) = T RSDp(ti, ti+n) for 1 ≤ i ≤ T − n and some
1 ≤ n ≤ T − 1. We then deﬁne r(i, n) as the average of all
rp(i, n) that can be computed, i.e., for all preﬁxes that have routing
information at times ti and ti+n in our datasets. We use average
of rp(i, n) because it gives a measure of the total magnitude of
change. Thus, r(i, n) represents average proportion of change in
next-hop decisions at timescale n.
Figure 2 presents the time series of r(i, n) for our 4 datasets,
where n is 1, 2, 7 and 30 days for datasets 1 to 3 (daily), and n is
1, 2, 6, 12 and 24 months for dataset 4 (monthly). From now on, to
simplify discussion, we assume that time indices always represent
days for datasets 1, 2 and 3, and represent months for dataset 4.
The ﬁrst striking aspect of these time series is that they are all
are approximately stationary. That is, they ﬂuctuate around a mean
value, but do not show any long-term trend. Furthermore, the mean
values of TRSD do not show signiﬁcant differences across years,
from 2005 to 2012. This indicates that despite the considerable
growth of the Internet in terms of ASes and Preﬁxes (which might
suggest more next-hop options per AS) there is an approximately
constant rate of routing decision changes over time. For example,
for n = 30 days in the daily datasets we have that r(i, n) is ap-
proximately 0.1, meaning that from month to month, on average,
10% of the Internet changes in terms of next-hop routing decisions.
The same value can be seen in the monthly dataset for the curve
n = 1 month.
The next observation is that as n grows so does r(i, n). This
implies that at least a portion of the routing changes that happen
over time are persistent, i.e., are not undone quickly so as to return
to a previous routing state. On the other hand, we cannot say that it
is a system governed by system-wide changes. To see that we can
refer to the curve r(i, 24) of the monthly dataset. From this curve
we can see that in a time window of 2 years, approximately 50% of
the next-hop choices persisted (because 50% changed). This fact
indicates many routes are stable over a long period of time.
Yet another property that can be seen in the daily datasets is re-
lated to seasonality. One can note that for n = 1 day there is
pattern of weekly variation in the data. This may be explainable
as evidence of human input (network operators) in the system. We
explore this conjecture in the following section.
