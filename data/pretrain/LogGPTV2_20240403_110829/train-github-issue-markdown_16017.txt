By following the Templates section on Best Practices book, I should have the
following code in my controller:
    public function indexAction()
    {
        return $this->render('default/index.html.twig');
    }
This throw the following exception:
    Template name "default/index.html.twig" is not valid (format is "bundle:section:template.format.engine").
I'm using `"symfony/symfony": "2.6.*"`.
I think the template path validator should be reviewed, isn't it ?
Thanks.
