It has been suggested on the mailing list (citation needed) that some users wish to run Go with heap sizes exceeding the current default limit of 128 GB. To address this, we could consider revising the heap size limit with each Go release, based on a specific metric. One potential metric would be to ensure that Go can address all the memory available on the largest virtual machine (VM) offered by cloud providers such as Amazon and Google. 

This approach would help maintain Go's compatibility with high-memory environments and align its capabilities with the evolving offerings of major cloud services.
