It's been brought up on the mailing list (citation needed) that some people
want to run Go with heaps beyond the default limit (128 GB today).
Perhaps we should revise the limit at each Go release according to some
metric. One possible metric would be to make sure that Go can address all the
memory available on the largest VM you can rent from Amazon or from Google.
