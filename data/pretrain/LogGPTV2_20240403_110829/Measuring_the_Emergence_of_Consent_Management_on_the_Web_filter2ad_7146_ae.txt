### Liability and Consent Collection

Vendors claiming a legitimate interest rather than obtaining consent face significant liability risks [33]. For every purpose outlined in the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), at least 20% of vendors assert that they do not need to collect consent to process personal data (see Figure 8). More broadly, one might question why websites agree to collect consent for all vendors on the Global Vendor List, given that there is no observed benefit to doing so [60].

### The Future of Consent Management

If current trends continue, certain Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) like Quantcast and OneTrust are likely to gain market share at the expense of others. A theoretical model predicts that sharing consent among CMP customers will create a "winner-takes-all" dynamic, leading to a single global coalition [60]. In reality, jurisdictional boundaries will likely result in multiple distinct coalitions, with Quantcast and OneTrust establishing dominance in the EU+UK and the US, respectively. However, users often disregard such jurisdictions, which may exacerbate the differences in web experiences based on the user's apparent location, as observed in this study.

### Legal Compliance and the Internet

The rise of CMPs should be viewed as part of a broader process by which legal compliance shapes the internet. For example, liability for content shared on technology platforms has become more pronounced following a May 2020 executive order in the US [15]. This represents a departure from the utopian view of the internet as a libertarian paradise [3]. It is essential to consider a compliance layer of the internet, driven by the content and privacy policies of private firms, as influenced by national laws. Before regulators demand measurements as evidence, the community should reflect on how to support large-scale auditing, evidential standards, and related ethical issues.

### Related Work

Returning to the metaphor of Figure 2, consent flows from a user’s privacy preferences through a consent dialogue to the recipient of the consent signal and then to third parties. This section identifies related work at each interface, though none of the studies make measurements at as many interfaces as we do.

- **User Privacy Preferences:** Qualitative research exploring users' privacy preferences informs internet design by identifying disparities between what users want and what happens online [4, 23, 40] or by highlighting the business value of obtaining explicit consent [61].
- **User Interface:** Lab experiments have consistently shown that users can be influenced to provide consent by changing framing [2, 5] and design choices, such as default settings [28, 30] and positioning [56]. Nouwens et al. [39] analyzed post-GDPR UK websites and found that common practices, like not offering fine-grained controls on the first page, increase the likelihood of consent. Our controlled experiment with real CMP dialogs on a public website complements this work by showing that users incur different time costs based on their privacy preferences, highlighting the burden on privacy-aware users.
- **Consent Dialogues and Websites:** Around 50% of the websites in [39] do not offer a one-click opt-out, which is confirmed by our samples of Quantcast websites. Degeling et al. [11] showed that 62% of sampled European websites displayed cookie prompts right after GDPR came into effect in May 2018, up from 46% in January 2018. These effects are not limited to Europe, as US websites also approach cookie regulations similarly to the EU [48], although this is not true for Chinese websites.
- **Third-Party Tracking:** Research has primarily focused on the extent of third-party tracking rather than how third parties obtain consent. Iordanou et al. [22] introduced a methodology for measuring tracking at scale and found that most tracking flows across European borders but remains within the EU. Sørensen and Kosta [50] did not observe any change in the number of third-party trackers before and after GDPR, although they noted that third-party tracking is more prevalent on private websites than on public ones. Even after GDPR, Sanchez-Rola et al. [48] found that 90% of sampled websites use cookies that could identify users. Such results are difficult to evaluate without context. For example, a website needs to identify users who have not consented to avoid repeatedly presenting consent dialogues, which would violate the California Consumer Privacy Act.

### TCF Standard and Privacy Violations

Using the TCF standard for measurement provides a way forward. Matte et al. [32] analyzed sites using the TCF and found discrepancies between communicated preferences and stored global cookies, indicating potential privacy violations. For example, 12% of websites send the consent signal before the user makes a choice, and some even record consent after an explicit opt-out. In another study, the same authors argued that the purposes in the TCF are not specific or explicit enough to be legally compliant [33] and measured which vendors claim these as a legitimate interest.

### Economic Implications of CMPs

A theoretical work [60] considers the economic implications of CMPs forming "consent coalitions" where consent is shared across websites and vendors. Our measurements contradict their prediction of a "global coalition," which does not currently exist. However, the market is maturing, and our longitudinal results suggest a trend towards dominant CMPs in specific jurisdictions.

### Conclusion

In recent years, a consent ecosystem has emerged, allowing websites and third-party vendors to establish a legal basis for business models based on personal data. Our longitudinal approach tracks the rise of CMPs from less than 1% of the Tranco 10k toplist in February 2018 to almost 10% in September 2020. We show that privacy laws (GDPR and CCPA) coming into effect caused spikes in adoption. We document inter-firm competition, with certain CMPs (e.g., Cookiebot) losing customers while others (e.g., Quantcast in the EU+UK and OneTrust in the US) slowly establish dominance. This increasing market dominance allows private actors, often tied to the Ad-tech industry, to standardize the terms of user consent, the user interface, and how consent is shared with third parties.

Although increasing market power is concerning, the same standardization opens up new measurement opportunities. We tracked how third-party vendors justify their data processing activities, capturing changes over time, such as the shift towards obtaining consent. Similarly, we showed how the consent dialogues offered by CMPs impose a time cost on privacy-aware users. These exact dialogues are used by the CMPs' customers, improving the ecological validity of our real-user study. Regulators could leverage the structure provided by CMPs to audit privacy practices at scale.
