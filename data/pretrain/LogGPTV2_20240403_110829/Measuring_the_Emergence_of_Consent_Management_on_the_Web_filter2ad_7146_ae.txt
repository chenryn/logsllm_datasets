The specter of liability looms over vendors claiming a legitimate
interest rather than obtaining consent [33]. For every purpose in the
TCF, at least a fifth of the vendors claim they do not need to collect
consent to process personal data (see Figure 8). More generally, one
might ask why websites agree to collect consent for all of the Global
Vendor List given there is no observed benefit to doing so [60].
The Future of Consent Management. If trends during the forma-
tion of the ecosystem continue, Figure 4 suggests that certain CMPs
(Quantcast, OneTrust) will win market share from the others. A
theoretical model predicts that sharing consent between the CMP’s
customers will create winner takes all dynamics leading to one
global coalition [60]. In reality, jurisdictional boundaries will likely
lead to multiple distinct coalitions given Quantcast and OneTrust
appear to be establishing dominance in the EU+UK and the US
respectively. However, users do not respect such jurisdictions. This
will likely exacerbate the extent to which the web differs based
on where the user appears to be located, which we observed at
multiple points in this study.
The rise of CMPs should be seen as part of a wider process by
which legal compliance shapes the internet. Liability for content
shared on technology platforms provides another example [15]
in light of a May 2020 executive order in the US. This represents
a departure from utopian views of the Internet as a libertarian
paradise [3]. One might begin to consider a compliance layer of
the internet driven by the content and privacy policies of private
firms as influenced by national laws. Before regulators demand
measurements as evidence, the community should reflect on how
to support auditing at scale, evidential standards, and surrounding
ethical issues.
6 RELATED WORK
Returning to the piping metaphor of Figure 2, consent flows from
a user’s privacy preferences through a consent dialogue to the
recipient of the consent signal and then on to third-parties. This
327
section identifies related work at each interface, though none of
the studies make measurements at as many interfaces as we do.
Qualitative research exploring privacy preferences of users in-
forms internet design by, for example, identifying disparities be-
tween what users want and what happens online [4, 23, 40] or by
highlighting the business value of obtaining explicit consent [61].
At the user-interface, lab experiments have consistently shown
users can be shifted towards providing consent by changing fram-
ing [2, 5] and design choices, such as default settings [28, 30] and
positioning [56]. Nouwens et al. [39] scrape post-GDPR UK web-
sites to identify popular design choices and show that common
practices like not having fine-grained controls on the first page in-
creases propensity to consent. Our controlled experiment with real
CMP dialogs on a public website complemented this body of work
by showing users incur differing time costs based on the privacy
preferences they express, highlighting how this punishes privacy
aware users.
The next point of the consent flow concerns how consent dia-
logues interact with websites. Around 50% of the websites in [39]
do not offer a 1-click opt out, which is confirmed by our samples of
Quantcast websites. A dialogue or cookie banner may not even be
shown. Degeling et al. [11] showed that 62 % of sampled European
websites displayed cookie prompts right after GDPR came into
effect in May 2018, up from 46 % in January 2018. However, these
effects are not limited to Europe as websites in the US “approach
cookie regulations similarly to the EU” [48], though this is not true
of Chinese websites.
Turning to third-parties, research has predominantly focused
on the extent of third-party tracking rather than how third-parties
obtain consent (the final part of the consent flow). Iordanou et al.
[22] introduce a methodology for measuring tracking at scale and
show that the majority of tracking flows across European borders
but, surprisingly, remains within the EU. Sørensen and Kosta [50]
do not establish any change in the number of third-party track-
ers before and after GDPR, although they show that third-party
tracking is more prevalent in private websites than public. Even
after GDPR, Sanchez-Rola et al. [48] show that 90 % of sampled
websites use cookies that could be used to identify users. Such
results are hard to evaluate without more context. For example, a
website needs to identify users who have not consented in order to
not repeatedly present consent dialogues, which would violate the
California Consumer Privacy Act.
Basing measurement on the TCF standard provides a way for-
ward, Matte et al. [32] analyze sites using the TCF and find dispar-
ities between which preferences were communicated and which
were stored as global cookies, which is more reliable evidence of a
privacy violation. For example, 12 % of websites send the consent
signal before the user even makes a choice and some even record
the user’s consent after an explicit opt-out. In a different study, the
same authors build a legal argument that the purposes in the TCF
are not specific or explicit enough “to be used as legally-compliant
ones” [33] and measure which vendors claim these as a legitimate
interest.
Finally, a theoretical work [60] considers the economic impli-
cations of CMPs forming ‘consent coalitions’ in which consent is
shared across websites and vendors. Our measurements contradict
their theoretical prediction about a ‘global coalition’, which does
IMC ’20, October 27–29, 2020, Virtual Event, USA

not exist at present. The market will, however, further mature and
our longitudinal results suggest a trend towards dominant CMPs
in particular jurisdictions.
Considering our contribution to each aspect of online privacy in
isolation obscures how our measurement approach allowed us to
make longitudinal measurements across the entire consent ecosys-
tem. Similar ecosystem wide measurements include those of: the
advertising industry [14, 42, 43, 45]; online gaming [41]; VPN ser-
vices [21, 25]; web communities [62, 63]; and web porn [57]. All of
these studies, including ours, blend technical measurements with
considerations around the economic and social factors influencing
the agents in the ecosystem. Such studies provide a rigorous, em-
pirical basis for how social scientists theorize about the impact of
the Internet.
7 CONCLUSION
Recent years have seen the formation of a consent ecosystem
through which websites and third-party vendors establish a legal
basis for business models based on personal data. Our longitudinal
approach tracks the rise of CMPs from less than 1% of the Tranco
10k toplist in February 2018 to almost 10% in September 2020 and
we show that privacy laws (GDPR and CCPA) coming into effect
caused spikes in adoption. We document inter-firm competition by
which certain CMPs (e.g Cookiebot) bleed customers while others
slowly establish dominance in a specific jurisdiction, such as Quant-
cast in the EU+UK or OneTrust in the US. This increasing market
dominance allows private actors (often tied to the Ad-tech industry)
to standardize the terms user consent to, the user-interface through
which they do it, and also how it is shared with third-parties.
Although increasing market power is worrying, the same stan-
dardization opens up novel measurements opportunities. We
tracked how third-party vendors justified their data processing
activities, capturing changes over time like the shift towards ob-
taining consent. Similarly, we showed how the consent dialogues
offered by CMPs impose a time cost on privacy aware users. These
exact dialogues are used by the CMP’s customers, which improved
the ecological validity of our real-user study. More generally, regu-
lators could exploit the structure provided by CMPs to audit privacy
practices at scale.
