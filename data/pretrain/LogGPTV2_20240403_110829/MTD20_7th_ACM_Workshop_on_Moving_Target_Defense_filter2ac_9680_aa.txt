Abstract—Reactive defense mechanisms, such as intrusion
detection systems, have made signiﬁcant efforts to secure a system
or network for the last several decades. However, the nature of
reactive security mechanisms has limitations because potential
attackers cannot be prevented in advance. We are facing a
reality with the proliferation of persistent, advanced, intelligent
attacks while defenders are often way behind attackers in taking
appropriate actions to thwart potential attackers. The concept
of moving target defense (MTD) has emerged as a proactive
defense mechanism aiming to prevent attacks. In this work,
we conducted a comprehensive, in-depth survey to discuss the
following aspects of MTD: key roles, design principles, classiﬁca-
tions, common attacks, key methodologies, important algorithms,
metrics, evaluation methods, and application domains. We discuss
the pros and cons of all aspects of MTD surveyed in this work.
Lastly, we highlight insights and lessons learned from this study
and suggest future work directions. The aim of this paper is
to provide the overall trends of MTD research in terms of
critical aspects of defense systems for researchers who seek for
developing proactive, adaptive MTD mechanisms.
Index Terms—Moving target defense, proactive defense, cyber-
security, attack surface, shufﬂing, diversity, redundancy
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Motivation
In the classic “shell game,” dating at least to the times of
ancient Greece, a pea or ball is hidden under one of three
shells or cups, and players gamble to guess the location of the
pea after the shells have been moved. This game is also known
as “thimblerig,” “three shells and a pea,” and the “old army
game” and has variant forms, such as “Three-card Monte.”
The advantage for the operator of the game is that sufﬁcient
movement of the shells will confuse the players of the location
of the pea. This underlying idea exempliﬁes the philosophy

of the so-called “Moving Target Defense (MTD)” strategy in
cybersecurity [112].
The basic axiom of MTD is that it is impossible to provide
complete and perfect security for a given system. Given this,
the objective is to enable normal functioning of the system
(i.e., the normal provision of services) even in the presence
of malicious actors seeking to compromise the system. Since
attacks cannot be prevented, the goal is to defend against and
thwart attacks. In practice, this goal is achieved via MTD by
the manipulation of multiple system conﬁgurations to modify
and control the attack surface, where the attacker engages with
the system. MTD aims to increase uncertainty and complexity
for any attacker of the system, to decrease the opportunities
for the attacker to identify targets (e.g., vulnerable system
components), and to introduce higher cost in launching attacks
or scans (e.g., reconnaissance attacks). The desired result is
that the attacker will waste time and effort without gaining
useful intelligence about the system [69, 112].
Origins of the conception of MTD can be found under
different names in the computer security literature. Some of
these research areas include fault tolerance (or reliability using
redundancy) even since the 1970’s (e.g., n-version program-
ming (NVP) [12, 27]), reconﬁgurable computing (e.g., recon-
ﬁgurable software [37], network reconﬁguration [17]), and/or
bio-inspired cybersecurity (e.g., software / network diversity
for cybersecurity [90, 91]). In 2009,
the Networking and
Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD)
Program explicitly emphasized the concept of MTD in terms
of its effectiveness and efﬁciency, which can leverage existing
resources [58]. Since then, a fast-growing research community
has formed with a focus on MTD, and many initial works have
received signiﬁcant attention due to its fascinating approach
and merit. However, there has been relatively less effort to
comprehensively understand the overall trends in terms of
MTD classiﬁcations, attacks handled by MTD, metrics used to
measure the performance of MTD techniques, and associated
limitations of the existing MTD technologies. An overall in-
depth understanding of MTD techniques will guide us to
identify what aspects lack in existing MTD approaches and
accordingly what directions should be pursued for future
research. This is the aim of our survey paper.
B. Comparison of Our Work and Existing MTD Survey Papers
As signiﬁcant attention has been paid to this emerging ﬁeld
of research in the past ten years, some efforts have been
made to understand the state-of-the-art MTD technologies.

We compared our survey paper and the existing survey papers
in terms of their contributions, key design, and classiﬁcation
together with the following principal questions:
Q1: What attacks are considered more/less likely to be
handled by existing MTD techniques?
Q2: What MTD techniques are more commonly explored?
Q3: What theoretical and empirical methodologies are used
in developing and/or evaluating MTD techniques?
Q4: What speciﬁc limitations are identiﬁed in using a
particular technique?
Q5: What metrics are unavailable to measure the key
effectiveness of MTD techniques in terms of system security
and performance?
We discussed the contributions of each survey paper on MTD
based on the main criteria and principle questions in Table I.
MIT Lincoln Lab published a technical report providing an
extensive survey on MTD in 2013 [113], with a substantially
expanded and updated edition ﬁve years later [157]. Both
surveys are very helpful for readers interested in learning
each MTD technique with the classiﬁcation based on ‘what
to move’ in deploying MTD. Speciﬁcally,
they classiﬁed
MTD techniques under ﬁve categories: dynamic data, dynamic
software, dynamic runtime environments, dynamic platforms,
and dynamic networks. The second edition [157] particularly
includes an extensive list of MTD techniques for each cate-
gory. Consequently, they provided the types of attacks based
on the classiﬁed MTD. In our survey, we also categorize the
MTD based on techniques and operational layers which covers
the taxonomies used by [157] as well as provides the ways in
which those techniques can be combined together. The authors
described each technique under these criteria, which is useful
as a manual description of the techniques. However, this kind
of survey does not provide the succinct overall summary and
trends of the MTD research ﬁeld that would enable the readers
to discover answers to the principal questions (e.g., Q1-Q5).
On the other hand, our survey paper aims to answer these
questions.
Farris and Cybenko [48] studied the existing MTD tech-
niques to quantify their cost and effectiveness through an
expert opinion survey. They reached 120 cyber defense experts
and evaluated 39 MTD techniques. They ranked the most seven
dominant ones based on the quantiﬁcation criteria in terms of
cost against effectiveness. They found that the best MTD tech-
niques in terms of operating costs and the overall effectiveness
are the techniques using address space layout or instruction set
randomization while the worst is one performing network ran-
domization. Although their evaluation for quantifying costs are
well-evaluated based on the implementation and performance
costs, their consideration for quantifying the effectiveness of
MTD techniques is limited to the attacker’s workload. They
do not explicitly deﬁne what the effectiveness is in terms of
other important security metrics. Moreover, a set of studied
literature is limited to only 39 papers in which only 23 of
them are opted as dominant studies and used for the survey.
Cai et al. [22] also conducted an extensive survey on
the state-of-the-art MTD research by describing theoretical
approaches, strategies based on key characteristics, and eval-
uation methods used in those existing MTD approaches. The
authors provided a function-and-movement model categorizing
MTD techniques in a systematic way in terms of (1) three
layers of implementation including software, running platform,
and physical network; (2) function and movement models; and
(3) MTD, its strategies, and its evaluation. However, from
the reader’s perspective, it is challenging to understand the
principle questions Q1 and Q4-Q5. Although this classiﬁcation
covers a large portion of literature, it misses other perspectives
of MTD such as testbeds, a combinations of MTD techniques,
attack types, and the aforementioned limitations. In our survey
paper, these three questions are answered in Sections III, V,
and VII, respectively.
Recently, Lei et al. [94] published a survey paper on MTD
techniques. Although the authors conducted extensive surveys
of the existing MTD techniques in terms of strategy gener-
ation, shufﬂing implementation, and performance evaluation,
this work missed many MTD taxonomies to categorize and
understand the existing MTD techniques. This work also did
not survey an in-depth security analysis of MTD techniques
based on well-known security metrics used to evaluate the
current state-of-the-art MTD approaches. The MTD classiﬁ-
cation used in [94] is based on multiple criteria, such as the
theoretical basis (e.g., game theory, machine learning, genetic
algorithms), the techniques (e.g., transformation or shufﬂing
of system conﬁgurations), and the purpose of existing MTD
