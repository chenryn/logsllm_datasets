User: How can I setup a virtualized Ubuntu on real Windows so I can have two apps communicating simple messages between them? VM can be offline, no internet access. Real system probably offline too.
Assistant: Host<->VM communication on Windows host can be implemented in several ways, independently of hypervisor you are using:

Host Only network - just assign static IP for host and machine, and use sockets api to transfer your data via virtual network. Very good for large amount of data, but require a little bit time for configuration.
Virtual COM ports - if you don't want to use sockets api and want to write data to files(on linux VM)/named pipes(on windows host). This can be simpler because require almost zero configuration, but it will not work very well with large amount of data.

Choose what will fit your needs.
