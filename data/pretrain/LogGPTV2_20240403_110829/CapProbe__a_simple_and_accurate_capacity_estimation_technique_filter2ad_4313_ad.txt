### Value of Minimum Packet Pair Delay Sums and Cross-Traffic Analysis

The value of the minimum packet pair delay sums is smallest at the point corresponding to the narrow link capacity, which is 4 Mbps. When the cross-traffic rate is 4 Mbps, the TCP rates fluctuate but are limited to between 1 Mbps and 4 Mbps, depending on the scenario.

### CapProbe Performance with Different Cross-Traffic Types

When the cross-traffic rate is equal to the narrow link capacity, CapProbe still accurately measures the right capacity even for highly congested links. As shown in Figure 15(b), the strongest mode always occurs at 8 Mbps, representing the Post-Narrow Capacity Mode (PNCM) introduced in [4].

When the size of the packet pair packets is increased to 500 bytes, the results from Figure 16(a) and 16(b) show that CapProbe continues to estimate the correct capacity for different cross-traffic values. The emergence of the Asymptotic Dispersion Rate (ADR) is noted, which is the strongest mode when the cross-traffic is 3 Mbps.

For path-persistent and CBR cross-traffic using UDP, the results differ from those with TCP because UDP is not reactive to congestion. From Figure 17(a), CapProbe predicts the correct capacity until the UDP cross-traffic reaches 2 Mbps, i.e., a load of 50% on the narrow link. For higher cross-traffic rates, no samples corresponding to the correct capacity are obtained, and the estimated bandwidth is 8 Mbps, as shown in Figure 17(b).

### Measurement Experiments

We evaluated the performance of CapProbe in terms of speed and accuracy. CapProbe was implemented using ICMP PING packets sent in pairs. This required careful selection of test paths due to potential blocking by firewalls. CapProbe can also be implemented as a UDP-based client-server application, similar to pathrate, but this requires a module at the destination.

A Pentium 4 2.5 GHz machine at our university served as the source, running CapProbe, pathrate, and pathchar. Destination machines were chosen from the Internet, Abilene, and CalREN networks to provide different types of paths. Abilene is a high-speed 10 Gbps national backbone, while CalREN is a high-speed network connecting universities in California.

#### Path Characteristics
- **UCLA-2**: Involves a wireless hop with 802.11b technology.
- **WLSH**: Narrow link capacity is 1.5 Mbps.
- All other paths have a narrow link of 100 Mbps.

### Comparison with Other Techniques

**Table 5: Comparison of Convergence Time and Capacity (in Mbps) of CapProbe, Pathrate, and Pathchar**
| Destination | CapProbe (Time/Capacity) | Pathrate (Time/Capacity) | Pathchar (Time/Capacity) |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| UCLA-2      | 0'03/5.5                 | 0'03/5.6                 | 6'10/5.5                 |

CapProbe and pathrate were found to be quite accurate in most scenarios, while pathchar estimates were often incorrect due to accumulated errors. Pathrate typically required minutes to yield an estimate, whereas CapProbe could achieve similar accuracy in a minute or even a few seconds.

### Related Work

Previous work on estimating path capacity has primarily used packet pair or train dispersions. Carter proposed bprobe in [3], which applies filtering methods to packet pair measurements. CapProbe, however, demonstrates superior speed and accuracy, making it suitable for online capacity estimation, especially over wireless links where capacity can vary frequently.
