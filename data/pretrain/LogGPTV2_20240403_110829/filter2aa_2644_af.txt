### Network Scans and Their Risks

Regardless of the tool used, network scans inherently carry a degree of risk, particularly when performed on a live system. However, it is possible to conduct safe scans by carefully controlling the scanning speed to prevent unintentional denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### Device Targets for Industrial Hardening

In an industrial hardening project, the following cyber devices may be targeted:
- Clients
- Servers
- Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
- Distributed Control Systems (DCSs)
- Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)
- Network switches

While these are not the only devices that need hardening, they are critical components that must not be overlooked. Each class of targets presents unique challenges and implementation risks. Vulnerability data, combined with device classifications, can help determine the order in which devices should be hardened. These projects are neither short-lived nor simple. For example, a large power plant might have:
- Upwards of 150 computers and servers associated with plant systems
- Around 50 PLCs
- 1 to 5 discrete DCS loops
- Upwards of 100 HMIs
- A variable number of network switches, which typically correlates more with design effectiveness and management than with plant size.

Hardening all devices in a plant is a significant undertaking, even assuming the network is well-designed. Given the length of such projects, some devices will need to be hardened while the plant is operational. While it is ideal to choose the least critical devices for this, a well-analyzed risk assessment may sometimes necessitate hardening more critical devices.

### Subject Matters of Hardening Efforts

Both baseline and device-specific hardening projects may include, but are not limited to:
- **Surface Area Reduction**: Reducing the number of open ports, programs, and services.
- **Configuration and Security Settings**: Group Policy Objects (GPOs), firewall rules, user and password policies, patch management, etc.
- **Protection Software**: Intrusion detection and prevention, virus protection, firewalls, etc.
- **Communications and Data Hardening**: Protocol use, encryption, authentication, data redundancy, etc.
- **Maintenance and Physical Security**: Scheduled defragmentation, registry cleanup, hardware locks, enclosures, redundancies, etc.
- **Network Architecture and Segmentation**
- **Legacy System Replacement**: Replacing outdated, non-vendor-supported, or high-risk legacy systems

Each subject matter presents unique challenges and implementation risks, which will be discussed in the following sections, except for the last two, which are covered elsewhere.

### Surface Area Reduction

Reducing the amount of software and the number of open ports on devices makes them inherently more secure. The order of reduction should be:
1. Programs
2. Services
3. Ports

This sequence ensures that dependencies are respected. For example, programs use services, and both use ports. Any other order could invalidate or reduce the effectiveness of the hardening process. The steps for surface area reduction are:
1. Identify required ports, programs, or services.
2. Determine which are not being used and remove (programs and services), deactivate (services or ports), or block (ports).
3. Provide a justification for all remaining ports, programs, and services.

Identifying required components is straightforward if done by someone familiar with the system. Simulators, drive images, and virtualization can be invaluable for testing the removal or deactivation of components. If adverse effects are observed, the component should be re-enabled, and the effects documented. If no functionality is lost, it is safe to disable the component. All unneeded ports, programs, and services should be removed. If an entire network is accurately virtualized, the results can be directly applied to the devices.

Common programs and services to remove include:
- Games
- Messaging services (e.g., MSN, AOL IM)
- Sample or demo software
- Unused document processing utilities
- Insecure remote access software
- Unnecessary logic and software compilers

Service removal requires particular care and expertise. If it is unclear whether a service is needed, it must be fully tested in a lab environment. Once it is determined that a service is not needed, it should be fully uninstalled whenever possible. Tools like Windows Task Manager, GPOs, and third-party tools like WinAudit or ConfigureSoftâ€™s ECM can assist in this process. It is recommended to standardize on a set of tools to maximize automation and scheduling capabilities.

### Security and Configuration Settings

Security and configuration settings are highly dependent on the operating system. Even between versions of the same OS, variations exist. Therefore, a baseline settings policy must be defined for each operating system. This assumes all devices are patched to the same level; otherwise, patches should be updated before developing security and configuration policies.

Settings can be managed locally using management consoles and security templates, but implementing the appropriate infrastructure first is more cost-effective in the long term. Each OS manufacturer provides documentation, and additional third-party guides can be useful. For Windows security settings, a recommended resource is http://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/.

Examples of important user management policies include:
- Use two-factor authentication for local and remote logins, especially if connecting through multiple zones or ESPs.
- Avoid generic account names and shared accounts.
- Change passwords at most every 90 days and ensure no password is reused for at least two years.
- Limit unsuccessful login attempts to three before requiring a waiting period.

### Protection Software

Protection software, such as virus protection, intrusion detection and prevention, malware prevention, and firewalls, should be included in a device's profile if it does not adversely affect the device's functionality. Many process computers are old and unsupported, making it challenging to run modern protection software. Performance reports over several days can help determine which devices can handle the added load.

Virus protection software should scan during low-load times, and certain areas should be continuously monitored. Malware, adware, and spyware prevention are also crucial. Recommended manufacturers for each type of protection software include:
- **Virus Prevention and Protection**: Symantec, Trend Micro, AVG, Avast, BitDefender, Barracuda Networks
- **Malware Prevention and Protection**: MalwareBytes
- **Adware Prevention and Protection**: Ad-Aware, McAfee, Trend Micro, Windows Defender, Popup Blockers
- **Spyware Prevention and Protection**: Ad-Aware, Windows System Monitoring Controls, Other Continuous Monitoring Software

Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are essential for detecting and responding to potential unauthorized intrusions. Common detection methodologies include signature-based, anomaly-based, and stateful protocol analysis. Recommended IDPS tools include Snort, OSSEC HIDS, Fragrouter, BASE, and Sguil.

Firewalls are crucial for controlling communications and closing unnecessary ports. Firewall rules should be specific, considering source, destination, protocols, ports, and services. All open ports should be justified, and varying the manufacturer of firewall software can help mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Communication and Data Hardening

Communication hardening involves limiting protocol use, open ports, authentication, encryption, and data integrity. Authentication ensures that communications are from authorized sources. Data hardening includes encryption, redundancy, off-site redundancy, image comparators, automatic data restoration, corrupt data detection, and RAID technologies.

Data redundancy requires a formal backup and recovery program to store and roll back configuration changes in case of failure, attack, or compromise. Only one approach to backup and recovery should govern a single class of devices to minimize cost and confusion. Each device grouping needs a step-by-step backup generation, data validation, data restoration, and data redundancy plan. Backup systems should be centralized, secured, and at least partially automated to reduce costs and increase reliability.

Backup media selection should consider current and future capacity, automation, time to generate and restore, storage requirements, reliability, and security. Ideally, a primary backup should remain on-site, and a secondary backup should be placed off-site at a secure location. Separate data and the OS root drive on two physical drives to aid in system restoration and segment any damage caused by an attack.

Backup generation should create backups suitable for worst-case scenarios. Regularly scheduled backups should be made for all level 1, 2, and 3 devices. Backup files should be titled with the device name or identifier, followed by the date and time for auditing purposes. Backup validation ensures that the backup operation was successful and that the stored backup did not degrade over time.
