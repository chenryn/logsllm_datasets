Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the KQL (Kusto Query Language) query to detect credential theft via SAM database export using LaZagne:

```kql
// Detect credential theft via SAM database export by LaZagne
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(7d)
| where FileName =~ "reg.exe"
    and ProcessCommandLine has_any ("save", "hklm", "sam")
| project DeviceId, Timestamp, InitiatingProcessId, 
           InitiatingProcessFileName, ProcessId, FileName, ProcessCommandLine
| extend DetectionDetails = "Potential credential theft via SAM database export detected. The process involved 'reg.exe' with command line parameters indicating an attempt to save the SAM registry hive."
```

### Explanation:
- **Timestamp Filter**: The query filters events that occurred within the last 7 days.
- **FileName and Command Line Parameters**: It looks for `reg.exe` processes with command-line arguments that include `save`, `hklm`, and `sam`. These are typical indicators of an attempt to export the SAM database.
- **Projection**: The relevant fields are projected for further analysis.
- **Extended Field**: An additional field `DetectionDetails` is added to provide a clear description of the detection.

This query should help you identify potential credential theft attempts involving the SAM database export.
