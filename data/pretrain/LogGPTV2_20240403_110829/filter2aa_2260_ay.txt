documented long-term strategy or a specific plan for sustainable funding of interoperable communications, 
the organizations develop their budgets and procure communications equipment with consideration for 
regional interoperable communications goals through federal funds and state and local resources.  State and 
local leadership has made interoperability a fiscal priority by obtaining and allocating grant monies and state 
resources to communications. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Clarify the decision-making authority and the implementation responsibilities of the governing bodies 
(i.e., State of Maine HSAC, communications specific CONOPS group, Radio Network Board, TICP 
Working Group) through a formalized charter and ensure local first responder participation 
• 
Share formal agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) with other areas as a best practice 
• 
Develop, document, and implement a regional strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP 
and CONOPS) that includes longer term regional goals, regulatory changes, and a long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 
years) communications funding strategy beyond grants 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Consider developing funding plans jointly as a area to maximize shared resources 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official(s), with political and fiscal authority, to 
specifically focus on interoperability  
• 
Communicate the success of the TICP to gain further leadership support

The Portland metropolitan area has demonstrated success in incorporating existing mutual aid agreements 
(State of Maine CONOPS) involving interoperability into the Portland TICP.  The area held a TICP 
Implementation Workshop to inform and train participants in the plan, but no further regional dissemination 
of these SOPs to additional agencies is evident.  Portland is beginning to implement National Incident 
Management System (NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) and encountered only minor command and 
control problems during the exercise (e.g., Communications Unit Leader announcement was not included as 
part of the TICP, ICS Form 205 was not updated). 
Recommendations: 
• 
Continue distributing regional interoperability SOPs (beyond the TICP), to all participating agencies and 
dispatch centers 
• 
Initiate basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance 
Usage:  Advanced Implementation 
The Portland area regularly uses shared channels and shared systems in day-to-day operations.  During the 
exercise, the participants effectively established interoperable communications and demonstrated proficiency 
and familiarity with the available interoperability equipment (e.g., successfully provided tactical 
interoperable communications through the use of shared channels and systems).  For example, South 
Portland used Maine CONOPS channels for incident communications while Portland agencies used their 800 
megahertz (MHz) system.  There was a good level of participation from local, state, and federal agencies 
(e.g., Cumberland County Emergency Management Agency, Maine Emergency Management Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard), and the area should be commended for establishing a communications governance agreement 
(designated to share communication channels and capabilities) among the local agencies and the U.S. Coast 
Guard. 
Recommendation: 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Technology Overview    
The State of Maine uses the Maine State Communication Network Program, a very high frequency (VHF) high band 
system intended to support all state-level public safety agencies.  The State of Maine Department of Transportation uses 
a VHF low band system.  Additionally, local and county radio systems are independently managed and operated.  
Specific shared interoperable communications channels are described by the Maine CONOPS.  The CONOPS is fully 
functional within the cities of Portland and South Portland.  In addition, the City of Portland supports 800 MHz ICALL 
and ITAC1 as standard National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee channels, but coverage is limited to the I-
95 corridor.  Gateways consisting of audio bridges, console patches, and crossband repeaters are used by various 
agencies.  The City of Portland supports local agencies using an 800 MHz Motorola SMARTNET™ I System and has a 
halo of VHF stations that link into its 800 MHz system, which allows city practitioners to communicate with the 
surrounding communities on the VHF band.  In the near term, the area’s emphasis is on extending the CONOPS 
concept throughout the state.  Mid-term and long-term planning includes improving interoperability among the major 
cities, as well as the local and county independently managed systems.

The Mississippi Wireless Communications Commission established the Mississippi Capitol Region (MCR) 
Committee (MCRC) to develop the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) and is beginning to 
establish interoperability as a priority in the area.  Although the area has taken a positive step in establishing 
the governance group, it would benefit from a clearer statement of its mission and responsibilities (possibly 
through updating the charter).  The decision-making group does not meet regularly; therefore, it appears that 
the group cannot adequately address interoperability issues among Rankin and Hinds counties (identified in 
the After Action Report).  It appears that statewide mutual aid agreements were the sole published and active 
agreements in place to ensure interoperability before the TICP and that there are no agreements specifically 
for the purpose of interoperability.  The area is working on developing a strategic plan, and once completed, 
it will need to be distributed to regional public safety agencies. Regional leadership and local jurisdictions 
within MCR appear to be working to develop a regional plan upon which to base budgets and procurement 
decisions. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Establish regularly scheduled MCRC meetings and expand MCRC membership to appropriate 
jurisdictional levels (e.g., local, state, and federal representation) 
• 
Document and put into practice agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating 
agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability  
• 
Encourage planning and development of a strategic plan beyond the operational plan outlined in the 
TICP with participant approval, adoption, and acceptance; align local and state strategic planning efforts 
to ensure that regional interoperability is needs are met 
• 
Initiate the development and implementation of a regional approach to long-term (e.g., 3 to 5 years) 
communications interoperability planning and sustainable funding 
• 
Continue to involve government leadership in communications interoperability issues and encourage 
long-term regional funding plans

The MCR used previously existing informal guidelines among jurisdictions in the area to develop new 
interoperable communications SOPs for the TICP.  As a result, the TICP provided the area’s first SOPs 
focused on interoperability.  These SOPs were disseminated to public safety agencies in the area at the TICP 
Workshop.  MCR reports compliance with National Incident Management System (NIMS)/Incident 
Command System (ICS) and began training more than 1 year ago.  During the exercise, the area as a whole 
did not fully demonstrate interoperability proficiency with NIMS/ICS, specifically the Jackson Incident

Jackson officials report that the area’s first responders have been largely successful in implementing 
interoperability solutions during recent events requiring multijurisdictional response.  During the TICP 
exercise, some agencies within Madison and Rankin counties were able to communicate; however, the 
participants did not demonstrate proficiency in using their available means of interoperable communications 
(e.g., radio caches, gateways, shared channels, shared systems).  For example, according to the After Action 
Report, “the City of Jackson was unable to communicate effectively with other agencies because its radio 
architecture differs from those of surrounding systems. 
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise the deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
of use (e.g., practice use of radio caches and mobile gateways) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Mississippi has a very high frequency (VHF) low band radio system that can be used anywhere in the state, including 
with many VHF, ultra high frequency (UHF), and 800 megahertz (MHz), interoperable/mutual aid channels, including 
VHF VTAC and UHF UTAC in Jackson.  Four shared systems can be used in the greater Jackson area, including three 
800 MHz systems and one VHF high band radio system.  There are more than 11 gateways or methods by which talk 
groups and/or channels can be patched. 
High on the interoperability communications priority list for the Jackson metropolitan area is the coordination of 
gateway and console patches in use.  It is the position of the area that permanent patching at fixed site gateways and 
base stations is critical for instant interoperable communications before mobile resources can be activated and 
operational.

Although the State of Montana has been active in interoperability efforts, it is very unclear how established 
the defined area (Yellowstone County) is in this larger effort.  Specific to the TICP development and 
validation exercise, the governance structure did not appear well defined.  The development of a TICP that 
included only law enforcement agencies (as opposed to first responders as a whole) was particularly 
problematic (even if the TICP was initially based on existing law enforcement policies).  This was reinforced 
by some findings of the TICP validation exercise (e.g., the Billings Fire Department could not communicate 
with the Billings Police Department with shared channels).  While the area indicates that the state is 
developing regional strategic plans through the eight state consortiums, Yellowstone’s level of involvement 
in this state effort, or any strategic planning for the specified area is unclear.  Individual agencies currently 
develop and maintain their own budgets and procure equipment based on agency-specific needs, although 
agencies are looking toward considering interoperability across the metropolitan area in the future.  
Yellowstone County has mixed communications interoperability support from its first responder and political 
leadership.  
Recommendations:  
• 
Involve all first responders, as well as public support, state, federal, and tribal agencies in the decision-
making group and define roles and responsibilities 
• 
Document and formalize agreements (e.g., memoranda of understanding) among all participating 
agencies to support partnerships on regional interoperability 
• 
Consider broadening agreements to include state, federal, and tribal agencies 
• 
Develop and implement a strategic plan (beyond the operational focus of the TICP), with participant 
approval, adoption, and acceptance 
• 
Align local and statewide strategic planning efforts to ensure that regional interoperability needs are met 
• 
Incorporate a regional interoperability funding strategy into a strategic plan, with consideration of 
funding models (in addition to grants) that can leverage local, regional, and statewide strategic planning 
efforts 
• 
Continue to broaden and champion a governance structure that would more fully support regional 
interoperability 
• 
Consider the direct involvement of a high-level official, with political and fiscal authority, to specifically 
focus on interoperability

The Yellowstone TICP appears to have been developed primarily by the law enforcement community and 
only law enforcement is listed in the plan’s included agency list.  The area indicated that most of the existing 
law enforcement policies and procedures were incorporated in the TICP.  The area does not appear to have 
actively disseminated these SOPs.  A number of issues were encountered because the response in the TICP 
validation exercise did not comply with the policies in the plan.  The National Incident Management System 
(NIMS)/Incident Command System (ICS) has been implemented for more than a year and is formalized in 
the area’s policies.  As noted in the After Action Report (AAR), “the command and control operations…are 
among the most effective and disciplined the evaluators have seen.”  Despite this well-established command, 
the exercise did not successful incorporate the communications unit and communication unit leader (COML) 
position in the validation exercise.    
Recommendations: 
• 
Expand multidiscipline participation (beyond law enforcement) in the development of regional 
interoperability SOPs  
• 
Evolve TICP based on expanded participation and disseminate as appropriate 
• 
Continue basic and advanced training and exercises on SOPs (include communications unit 
implementation consistent with the TICP) to ensure that all participating first responder agencies attain 
and maintain NIMS/ICS compliance

Yellowstone officials indicated that they used their shared system and shared channels on a daily basis.  
Likewise, a crossband repeater is regularly used to link 800 megahertz (MHz) and very high frequency 
(VHF) agencies in the county.  Law enforcement agencies have a well-established color-coded shared 
channel plan, and the use of a shared channel (although not included in the TICP) was demonstrated during 
the exercise.  Law enforcement agencies were also effectively connected using a console patch.  As noted by 
the exercise evaluators, “The exercise validated the TICP within law enforcement; however it identified areas 
in need of improvement for interoperability within other agencies.”  Specifically, the AAR indicated that, 
“Within the City of Billings, the Police Department cannot talk to the Fire department although they are on a 
shared system.”        
Recommendations: 
• 
Regularly test and exercise deployment of regional interoperability resources to improve proficiency 
(e.g., use of shared system across disciplines) 
• 
Consider adding communications interoperability as a component of all future exercises

Funding from Department of Homeland Security grants to the Montana metropolitan area is coordinated through 
Montana Disaster and Emergency Services (MDES).  In Yellowstone County, there are two radio caches. Also, 800 
MHz and VHF mutual aid frequencies are used as interoperable channels.  There are two fixed gateways—a permanent 
crossband unit that directly patches 800 MHz and VHF frequencies for interoperable communications, and a temporary 
800 MHz-to-VHF patch.  In addition, there is an 800 MHz analog trunked shared system (City of Billings system) that 
supports the entire area.

New Hampshire has a Joint Committee for first responders that has oversight for interoperability in the state.  
For the purposes of the Tactical Interoperable Communications Plan (TICP) development, Concord 
established a working group of state officials and multidiscipline agencies.  Federal and public support 
agencies (e.g., the National Guard, acute care hospitals) were involved in the TICP development.  The area 
indicated that an interoperability memorandum of understanding (MOU) was in place for all local agencies in 
the state.  The area indicated, however, that there was no single strategic planning document for 
interoperability.  New Hampshire has developed a long-term infrastructure strategy (as included in Section 7 
of the TICP), which is implemented as grant funding becomes available.  It is not clear whether a long-term 
funding strategy to support the lifecycle costs of these systems is in place.  There appears to be strong 
support for resolving interoperability issues at all levels of government.  As noted by exercise evaluators, 
“There was a high level of commitment and involvement by state government officials.  It was clear that the 
area benefited from the leadership and facilitation of a committed advocate.” 
Recommendations: 
• 
Involve federal and public support organizations in the decision-making group and document roles and 
responsibilities as part of the group 
• 
Develop and review agreements (e.g., MOUs) at least every 3 to 5 years and after significant events or
