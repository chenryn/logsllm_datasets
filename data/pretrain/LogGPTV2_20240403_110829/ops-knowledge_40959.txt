For example, on a Debian-based system, use the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install apache2 2. Start the Apache service: sudo service apache2 start 3. Visit the server IP address or domain name in a web browser to confirm Apache has been successfully installed. 4. Modify the Apache configuration file (/etc/apache2/apache2.conf) to meet your needs, such as changing the default document root directory, virtual host configuration, etc. Install Nginx: 1. Install Nginx using the package manager. For example, on a Debian-based system, use the following commands: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install nginx 2.
