Syntactic Web
World Wide Web
(cid:122)
Primarily composed of documents written in
(cid:122)
HTML
HTML is a set of “markup” symbols
(cid:122)
Useful for visual presentation
(cid:122)
Designed only for human consumption
(cid:122)
Humans can read Web pages and understand
(cid:122)
them
but their inherent meaning is not shown in a way that
(cid:122)
allows their interpretation by computers
4
5
Semantic Web
Define Web information in a way that it can be used
(cid:122)
by computers
Not only for display purposes
(cid:122)
But also for interoperability and integration between
(cid:122)
systems
Challenge
(cid:122)
Enable machine-to-machine exchange and automated
(cid:122)
processing
One Solution
(cid:122)
Provide the information in such a way that computers can
(cid:122)
understand it.
This is the objective of the semantic Web
(cid:122)
Make possible the processing of Web information by
(cid:122)
computers

Semantic Web
“The Semantic Web is not a separate Web
(cid:122)
but an extension of the current one, in which
information is given well-defined meaning,
better enabling computers and people to
work in cooperation.” (Berners-Lee, Hendler
et al. 2001).
The next generation of the Web will combine:
(cid:122)
Existing Web technologies
(cid:122)
Knowledge representation formalisms (Grau
(cid:122)
2004)

Semantic Web
Currently the Web is in evolution
(cid:122)
Syntactic Web Semantic Web
(cid:122) (cid:122)
Resources are linked Resources and links have
(cid:122) (cid:122)
together forming the Web meaning
No distinction between New standards and
(cid:122) (cid:122)
resources or links languages are being
investigated and developed.
7
8
Semantic Web
To give meaning to Web resource and links, the
(cid:122)
research community has developed semantic
standards such as
Resource Description Framework (RDF)
(cid:122)
RDF is a standard for creating descriptions of information
(cid:122)
What XML is for syntax, RDF is for semantics.
(cid:122)
Provides a clear set of rules for providing simple descriptive
(cid:122)
information.
Web Ontology Language (OWL)
(cid:122)
Is an extension of RDF
(cid:122)
Provides a language for defining structured Web-based
(cid:122)
ontologies which allows a richer integration and
interoperability of data among communities and domains.

Semiotics

10
Semiotics
General science of signs
(cid:122)
Such as icons, images, objects, tokens, and
(cid:122)
symbols – and how their meaning is transmitted
and understood.
A sign is generally defined as something that
(cid:122)
stands for something else.
The human language is a particular case of
(cid:122)
semiotics.
Semiotics is composed of three components:
(cid:122)
Syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
(cid:122)
10
11
Syntax
Deals with the formal or structural relations
•
between signs (or tokens) and the production
of new ones.
For example, grammatical syntax is the study of
•
which sequences of symbols are well formed
according to the recursive rules of grammar.
?
If a program is syntactically correct according to its
•
rules of syntax
The compiler will validate the syntax and will not
•
generate error messages.
Does not ensure that the program is semantically
•
correct.
11
12
Semantics
The study of relations between the system of
•
signs (such as words, phrases, and
sentences) and their meanings.
Semantics <> Syntax
•
Semantics: what something means
•
Syntax: formal structure/patterns in which
•
something is expressed
12
13
Pragmatics
The study of natural language understanding
•
Specifically the study of how context influences
•
the interpretation of meaning.
The context may include
•
Social, environmental, and psychological factors.
•
Pragmatics <> Semantics
•
Pragmatics: origin, uses, and effects of signs
•
within the content or context
Semantics: meaning of signs
•

Controlled vocabularies
The weaker end of the semantic spectrum
(cid:122)
Is a list of terms (e.g., words, phrases, or notations)
(cid:122)
Enumerated explicitly
(cid:122)
Unambiguous, non-redundant
(cid:122)
Limit choices to an agreed upon set of terms
(cid:122)
Objective
(cid:122)
Prevent users from defining their own terms
(cid:122)
User terms can be ambiguous, meaningless, or
(cid:122)
misspelled
Uses controlled vocabulary to search for products.
Books, Popular Music, Music Downloads,
Classical Music, DVD, VHS, Apparel,
Yellow Pages, Restaurants, etc.

Taxonomy
Subject-based classification
(cid:122)
Stove

Thesaurus
A networked collection of controlled vocabulary terms with
(cid:122)
conceptual relationships between terms
An extension of a taxonomy by allowing
(cid:122)
Terms to be arranged in a hierarchy
(cid:122)
Relationships to be made about the terms
(cid:122)
Types of relationships.
(cid:122)
Equivalence.
(cid:122)
Term t1 has the same or nearly the same meaning as a term t2.
(cid:122)
Homographic.
(cid:122)
Term t1 is spelled the same way as a term t2, but has a different
(cid:122)
meaning
Hierarchical.
(cid:122)
Degrees or levels of “is subclass of” and “is superclass of”
(cid:122)
relationships.
Associative.
(cid:122)
Link terms that are closely related in meaning semantically but not
(cid:122)
hierarchically. Ex: “is related to”, term t1 “is related to” term t2.

Ontologies
Ontologies are similar to taxonomies but use richer
(cid:122)
semantic relationships among terms and attributes
Are a shared conceptualization of the world.
(cid:122)
Provide a common understanding of a particular domain.
(cid:122)
Consist of definitional aspects such as high-level schemas
(cid:122)
and assertional aspects such as entities, attributes,
interrelationships between entities, domain vocabulary and
factual knowledge – all connected in a semantic manner
(Sheth 2003).
Uses of ontologies:
(cid:122)
Assist in communication between human beings
(cid:122)
Achieve interoperability among software systems

Examples of Real Ontologies
MGED Ontology
The MGED Ontology
(cid:122)
Provide standard terms for the annotation of microarray
(cid:122)
experiments.
Terms will enable unambiguous descriptions of how the
(cid:122)
experiment was performed.
212 classes, 101 properties.
(cid:122)
The MGED Ontology is being developed within the microarray
(cid:122)
community to provide consistent terminology for experiments.
This community effort has resulted in a list of multiple
(cid:122)
resources for many species.
Approximately 50 other ontologies for different species
(cid:122)
The concepts are structured in DAML+OIL and available in
(cid:122)
other formats (rdfs)
