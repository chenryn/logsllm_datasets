### Syntactic Web vs. Semantic Web

#### Syntactic Web
- **World Wide Web:**
  - Primarily composed of documents written in HTML.
  - HTML is a set of "markup" symbols useful for visual presentation.
  - Designed for human consumption.
  - Humans can read and understand web pages, but their inherent meaning is not interpretable by computers.

#### Semantic Web
- **Objective:**
  - Define web information in a way that it can be used by computers.
  - Not only for display purposes but also for interoperability and integration between systems.
  - Enable machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing.
  - Provide information in a way that computers can understand.
  - The next generation of the Web will combine existing web technologies with knowledge representation formalisms.

- **Definition:**
  - "The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation." (Berners-Lee, Hendler et al., 2001).

- **Evolution:**
  - Transition from a syntactic Web to a semantic Web.
  - In the syntactic Web, resources are linked together, forming the Web.
  - In the semantic Web, resources and links have meaning.
  - New standards and languages are being developed to support this transition.

- **Standards:**
  - **Resource Description Framework (RDF):**
    - A standard for creating descriptions of information.
    - Provides a clear set of rules for providing simple descriptive information.
    - RDF is to semantics what XML is to syntax.
  - **Web Ontology Language (OWL):**
    - An extension of RDF.
    - Provides a language for defining structured web-based ontologies, allowing richer integration and interoperability of data among communities and domains.

### Semiotics
- **General Science of Signs:**
  - Studies signs such as icons, images, objects, tokens, and symbols, and how their meaning is transmitted and understood.
  - A sign stands for something else.
  - Human language is a particular case of semiotics.
  - Composed of three components:
    - **Syntax:** Deals with the formal or structural relations between signs and the production of new ones.
    - **Semantics:** Studies the relations between the system of signs and their meanings.
    - **Pragmatics:** Studies natural language understanding, specifically how context influences the interpretation of meaning.

- **Syntax:**
  - Focuses on the formal structure and patterns of signs.
  - Ensures that sequences of symbols are well-formed according to the rules of grammar.
  - Does not ensure semantic correctness.

- **Semantics:**
  - Focuses on the meaning of signs.
  - Distinguishes between what something means and how it is expressed.

- **Pragmatics:**
  - Focuses on the origin, uses, and effects of signs within the context.
  - Considers social, environmental, and psychological factors.
  - Distinguishes between the meaning of signs and their contextual interpretation.

### Levels of Semantics
- **Controlled Vocabularies:**
  - A list of terms (e.g., words, phrases, or notations) enumerated explicitly.
  - Unambiguous and non-redundant.
  - Limits choices to an agreed-upon set of terms.
  - Prevents users from defining their own ambiguous or meaningless terms.
  - Example: Amazon's product categories (Books, Popular Music, etc.).

- **Taxonomy:**
  - Subject-based classification.
  - Arranges terms in a hierarchy without further elaboration.
  - Contains parent-child relationships (e.g., "is subclass of" and "is superclass of").
  - Describes a word by making explicit its relationship with other words.

- **Thesaurus:**
  - A networked collection of controlled vocabulary terms with conceptual relationships.
  - Extends taxonomies by allowing terms to be arranged in a hierarchy and establishing relationships.
  - Types of relationships:
    - **Equivalence:** Terms t1 and t2 have the same or nearly the same meaning.
    - **Homographic:** Terms t1 and t2 are spelled the same but have different meanings.
    - **Hierarchical:** Degrees or levels of "is subclass of" and "is superclass of" relationships.
    - **Associative:** Links terms that are closely related in meaning but not hierarchically.

- **Ontologies:**
  - Similar to taxonomies but use richer semantic relationships among terms and attributes.
  - Provide a shared conceptualization of the world.
  - Consist of definitional aspects (high-level schemas) and assertional aspects (entities, attributes, interrelationships).
  - Uses of ontologies:
    - Assist in communication between humans.
    - Achieve interoperability among software systems.

### Examples of Real Ontologies
- **MGED Ontology:**
  - Provides standard terms for the annotation of microarray experiments.
  - Enables unambiguous descriptions of experimental methods.
  - Contains 212 classes and 101 properties.
  - Developed within the microarray community for consistent terminology.
  - Structured in DAML+OIL and available in other formats (e.g., RDFS).

- **OBO (Open Biological Ontologies):**
  - An umbrella organization for structured shared controlled vocabularies and ontologies in genomics and proteomics.

- **Gene Ontology (GO):**
  - Describes gene products in terms of biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions.
  - Species-independent.
  - Available in flat files, XML, and MySQL formats.
  - Comprises component, process, and function ontologies.
