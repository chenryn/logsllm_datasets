**Abstract:**
Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are at the heart of evidence-based research, setting the foundation for future research and practice. However, producing high-quality, timely contributions is a challenging and highly cognitive endeavor, which has recently motivated the exploration of automation and support in the SLR process. This paper addresses an often-overlooked phase in this process: planning literature reviews. We explore how cognitive process augmentation can overcome the most salient challenges in this phase. We report on insights from 24 SLR authors regarding planning practices, challenges, and feedback on support strategies inspired by recent advances in cognitive computing. Our findings are framed under the cognitive augmentation framework, and we present a prototype implementation and evaluation focusing on technical feasibility.

### 1. Introduction

Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are valuable research contributions that follow a well-known, comprehensive, and transparent research methodology. They are central to evidence-based research, allowing researchers to systematically collect and integrate empirical evidence regarding research questions. Given their demonstrated value, SLRs are becoming increasingly popular in various disciplines, including medicine and software engineering [11].

Despite the valuable contributions of systematic reviews to science, producing high-quality, timely reviews is a challenging endeavor. Studies have shown that SLRs might fail to provide good and complete coverage of existing evidence, missing up to 40% of relevant papers [6], and may even become outdated by the time of publication [6, 22]. These challenges have been attributed to the demanding nature of the tasks involved, lack of expertise, limitations of support technology, and issues with primary studies [7, 8, 20].

Recent advances in cognitive computing and collaborative technology offer an opportunity to address these challenges and support researchers in planning, running, and reporting SLRs (see Fig. 1 for an overview of the SLR process).

**Fig. 1.** The SLR process, defined by planning, execution, and reporting activities.

We have seen new techniques and platforms enabling large-scale collaboration [13, 25, 26] and automation opportunities [9, 16, 19], offering promising results in different research activities relevant to the SLR process. Most of these efforts, however, are centered around the screening and identification of relevant scientific articles, leaving other critical tasks largely unexplored.

In this paper, we address a less-explored phase of the SLR process: planning the reviews. Guidelines and recommendations (e.g., [11]) define the main activities in this phase as:
1. Identifying the need for undertaking the review.
2. Defining the research questions (RQs).
3. Defining the search and eligibility criteria.
4. Defining the data extraction template.

These tasks are fundamental to guiding the SLR process and setting the foundation for meaningful and original contributions, good coverage of the literature, and a process free of bias. Yet, as we will see, they are often poorly performed, if at all.

In what follows, we investigate how cognitive augmentation can support the planning phase of SLRs. We build on the insights and feedback from SLR authors to identify challenges and support strategies inspired by recent advancements in cognitive computing. We frame our results under the cognitive process augmentation framework and report on our early prototype and evaluation runs, showing the potential of augmentation in identifying the need for undertaking a review by leveraging word embeddings to find relevant SLRs from input RQs.

### 2. Challenges in Planning SLRs

The challenges in running an SLR can be found throughout the entire process. These have been observed in the literature [7, 8, 20] and in our preliminary work, where we conducted an open-ended survey with more than 50 SLR authors to tap into their experience. The results indicated that planning tasks are generally perceived as difficult to manage, requiring a higher level of expertise and domain knowledge compared to more labor-intensive tasks.

Motivated by these insights, we conducted a second survey with 24 authors who published SLRs in top software engineering outlets in the last two years. This survey focused on their experience in planning SLRs and inquired about:
1. Whether planning tasks were properly addressed in their last SLR project.
2. The importance of addressing some salient challenges.
3. Feedback on some support strategies to address the emerging challenges.

**Fig. 2.** Summary of feedback from SLR authors. A) Feedback on how planning tasks are addressed. B) Importance of addressing salient challenges in the planning.

While most authors reported positively on having addressed the tasks properly—unsurprisingly given the quality of the outlets—there was still a significant number of researchers reporting neutral to negative, and in some cases, even not being aware of certain tasks. More illuminating is to observe the challenges we identified and the importance authors place on addressing them (Fig. 2), which we summarize and group below and address in the next section:

- **C1:** Inadequate experience and support by current tools and guidelines.
- **C2:** Insufficient context and knowledge to anticipate tasks in the planning phase.
- **C3:** Limitations of digital libraries to identify relevant SLRs.
- **C4:** Inadequate expert support and trust concerns in obtaining external feedback.

### 3. Cognitive Support in Planning SLRs

In this section, we present the conceptual design of a platform to support the planning of SLRs. We describe the solutions and strategies addressing the main challenges and the feedback obtained from SLR authors.

#### Strategies to Address Planning Challenges

The strategies were derived in brainstorming sessions among the co-authors, taking as input the insights from the first round of interviews with SLR authors on workarounds and strategies employed in the process, our own experience, and prior work. The resulting strategies leverage techniques from machine learning and data mining to address the main challenges. Below we describe the strategies for each of the challenges (C#):

- **Chatbot assistant (C1):** A chatbot that allows authors to ask questions about the SLR process and best practices. The chatbot provides a natural language interface to all information encoded in guidelines and recommendations.
- **Step-by-step guides (C1):** The interface provides a conversational interface that assists authors in the preparation of each "artifact" (e.g., RQs) by providing step-by-step prompts based on guidelines.
- **Incremental and iterative process (C2):** A process that can be adapted as more information becomes available to the researcher. For example, RQs and inclusion/exclusion criteria can be refined as similar literature reviews are identified and more is learned about the topic.
- **Incorporating context and knowledge (C2):** The system leverages information available in seed papers and similar literature reviews by extracting SLR-specific metadata relevant to the protocol (e.g., RQs, search strategy) and making it available to the authors as a reference point at each step.
- **Search focused on similar SLRs (C3):** Instead of defining complex queries and terms to identify similar reviews, the search focuses only on SLRs. The search results provide SLR-specific information, including RQs, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and search strategy.
- **From RQs to similar SLRs and papers (C3):** The system allows users to go from their (partial) RQs directly to similar SLRs by enriching information with extra data from seed papers.
- **Expert networking (C4):** We presented strategies including artifact-specific evaluation criteria, improved discovery of experts, and leveraging groups of trust. However, we limit the discussion on human-human collaboration.

**Fig. 3.** Interaction illustrating the first two steps in the planning: defining the RQs and identifying the need for the SLR. The same strategies apply to the rest of the steps.

#### Feedback from SLR Authors

We requested feedback on the concept tool and strategies in our second wave of the survey with 24 SLR authors. Authors were shown a mockup and descriptions and asked to:
1. Rate the strategies on whether they addressed the specific challenges.
2. Provide feedback on potential barriers for adopting them.
3. Suggest other alternatives not foreseen.

The strategies to address inadequate experience and support (C1) received positive feedback from almost all participants (15/16). For example, one participant stated, "I had to search for hours to understand how to get tasks done, so I think a Bot that helps with the common question would be really helpful." Another stated, "Support from peers is the most important help that I’ve been missing when conducting my study. [..] I didn’t know much about the process and where to start; the step-by-step guideline would have helped me a lot."

Participants reported potential barriers being:
1. Mismatch between the assistance provided by the tool and practices of the target domain of the SLR.
2. The quality of the underlying algorithms, including the actual bot recommendations.
