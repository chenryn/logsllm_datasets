1 Introduction
Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are valuable research contributions that
follow a well-known, comprehensive, and transparent research methodology. It
isattheheartofevidence-basedresearch,allowingresearcherstosystematically
collectandintegrateempiricalevidenceregardingresearchquestions.Giventheir
demonstrated value, SLRs are becoming an increasingly popular type of publi-
cation in different disciplines, from medicine to software engineering [11].
Despitethevaluablecontributionsofsystematicreviewstoscience,producing
good quality timely reviews is a challenging endeavor. Studies have shown that
SLRs might fail to provide a good and complete coverage of existing evidence,
missingupto40%ofrelevantpapers[6],andevenendupbeingoutdatedbythe
time of publication [6,22] – this without considering those never published.
The reasons behind these challenges have been documented in several stud-
ies[7,8,20],whichattributethemtothedemandingnatureoftheinvolvedtasks,

ies. Recent advances in cognitive computing and collaborative technology offer
anopportunitytoaddressthesechallenges,andsupportresearchersinplanning,
running and reporting SLRs (see Fig.1 for an overview of the SLR process).
We have seen new techniques and platforms enabling large-scale collaboration
[13,25,26],andautomation opportunities[9,16,19],offeringpromisingresultsin
different research activities relevant to the SLR process. Most of these efforts
however are centered around the screening and identification of relevant scien-
tific articles – and rightly so as it is one of the most time-consuming phases –
but leaving other critical tasks largely unexplored.
InthispaperweaddressamuchlessexploredphaseoftheSLRprocess,that
of planning the reviews. Guidelines and recommendations (e.g., [11]) define the
mainactivitiesinthisphaseasi)identifyingtheneedforundertakingthereview,
ii) defining the research questions (RQs), iii) defining the search and eligibility
criteria, and iv) the data extraction template. These tasks are fundamental to
guiding the SLR process and setting the foundation to having meaningful and
original contributions, good coverage of the literature and a process free of bias.
Yet, as we will see, they are often poorly performed, if at all.
In what follows we investigate how cognitive augmentation can support the
planningphaseofSLRs.WebuildontheinsightsandfeedbackfromSLRauthors
toidentify challenges andsupportstrategies inspiredbyrecentadvancements in

cess augmentation. We also report on our early prototype and evaluation runs,
showing the potential of augmentation in identifying the need for undertaking a
reviewbyleveragingwordembeddingstofindrelevantSLRsfromaninputRQs.
2 Challenges in Planning SLRs
The challenges in running an SLR can be found throughout the entire process.
These have been observed in the literature [7,8,20] as well as in our preliminary
work, where we run an open-ended survey with more than 50 SLR authors
tapping on their experience running SLRs. The results indicated that planning
tasks are generally perceived as difficult to manage, requiring higher level of
expertise and domain knowledge compared to more labor-intensive tasks.
326 M. Badami et al.
Motivated by these insights, we run a second survey with 24 authors who
published SLRs in top software engineering outlets in the last two years. This
survey focused on their experience in planning SLRs, and inquired about i)
whether planning tasks were properly addressed in their last SLR project, ii)
theimportanceofaddressingsomesalientchallenges,andaskedforiii)feedback
on some support strategies to address the emerging challenges. In Fig.2 we
summarise the feedback on the first two points.

are addressed. B) Importance of addressing salient challenges in the planning.
While most authors reported positively to having addressed the tasks prop-
erly–notsurprisinglygiventhequalityoftheoutlets–therewasstillasignificant
number of researchers reporting neutral to negative, and in some cases even not
being aware of certain tasks. More illuminating is to observe the challenges that
weidentifiedandtheimportanceauthorsputinaddressingthem(Fig.2),which
we summarise and group below and address in the next section:
C1 Inadequate experience and support by current tools and guidelines.
C2 Insufficientcontextandknowledgetoanticipatetasksintheplanningphase.
C3 Limitations of digital libraries to identify relevant SLRs.
C4 Inadequate expert support and trust concerns in obtaining external feed-
back.
3 Cognitive Support in Planning SLRs
In this section, we present the conceptual design of a platform to support the
planning of SLRs. In the following we describe the solutions and strategies
addressing the main challenges, and the feedback obtained from SLR authors.

Strategies to Address Planning Challenges. The strategies were derived
in brainstorming sessions among the co-authors, taking as input the insights
from the first round of interviews with SLR authors on workarounds and strate-
gies employed in the process, our own experience and prior work. The resulting
strategiesleveragetechniquesfrommachinelearninganddata-miningtoaddress
the main challenges. Below we describe the strategies for each of the challenges
(C#).
– Chatbot assistant that allows authors to ask questions about the SLR
process and best practices (C1). The chatbot provides a natural language
interface to all information encoded in guidelines and recommendations.
– Step-by-step guides for each of the tasks (C1). The interface provides a
conversational interface that assists authors in the preparation of each “arte-
fact”, (e.g., RQs), by providing step-by-step prompts based on guidelines.
– Incremental and iterative processthatcanbeadaptedasmoreinforma-
tion becomes available to the researcher (C2). For example, RQs and inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria can be refined as we identify similar literature reviews
and learn more about the topic.
– Incorporating context and knowledge(C2).Thesystemleveragesinfor-
mation available in seed papers and similar literature reviews by extracting
SLR-specific metadata relevant to the protocol (e.g., RQs, search strategy)
and making them available to the authors as a reference point at each step.
– SearchfocusedonsimilarSLRs(C3).Insteadofdefiningcomplexqueries
and terms to identify similar reviews, the search focuses only on SLRs.
The search results provide SLR-specific information, including RQs, inclu-
sion/exclusion criteria, search strategy, etc.
– From RQs to similar SLRs and papers (C3). The system allows users to
gofromtheir(partial)RQsdirectlytosimilarSLRsbyenrichinginformation
with extra data from seed papers.
– Expert networking (C4). We presented strategies including artefact-
specific evaluation criteria, improved discovery of experts, and leveraging
groups of trust. However, we limit the discussion on human-human collab-
oration.

done, so I think a Bot that helps with the common question would be really help-
ful”. Another one stated “Support from peers is the most important help that
I’ve been missing when conducting my study. [..] I didn’t know much about the
process and where to start, the step by step guideline would have helped me a
lot”.
