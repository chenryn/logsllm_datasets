Visible-* classes applied to li items that are part of a list-inline styled
list do not render inline, as the display: block !important; overrides the
display: inline-block; for the list.

Consider a fix of
.list-inline > li.visible-sm { display: inline-block !important; }
and similar at for the -md and -lg classes at the correct breakpoints.
