Abstract
Online tracking is evolving from browser- and device-
tracking to people-tracking. As users are increasingly access-
ing the Internet from multiple devices this new paradigm
of tracking—in most cases for purposes of advertising—is
aimed at crossing the boundary between a user’s individual
devices and browsers. It establishes a person-centric view
of a user across devices and seeks to combine the input from
various data sources into an individual and comprehensive
user profile. By its very nature such cross-device tracking can
principally reveal a complete picture of a person and, thus,
become more privacy-invasive than the siloed tracking via
HTTP cookies or other traditional and more limited tracking
mechanisms. In this study we are exploring cross-device
tracking techniques as well as their privacy implications.
Particularly, we demonstrate a method to detect the occur-
rence of cross-device tracking, and, based on a cross-device
tracking dataset that we collected from 126 Internet users,
we explore the prevalence of cross-device trackers on mobile
and desktop devices. We show that the similarity of IP
addresses and Internet history for a user’s devices gives rise
to a matching rate of F-1 = 0.91 for connecting a mobile to
a desktop device in our dataset. This finding is especially
noteworthy in light of the increase in learning power that
cross-device companies may achieve by leveraging user data
from more than one device. Given these privacy implications
of cross-device tracking we also examine compliance with
applicable self-regulation for 40 cross-device companies and
find that some are not transparent about their practices.
1 Introduction
A recent study by Google showed that 98% of surveyed Inter-
net users in the U.S. use multiple devices on a daily basis, and
90% switch devices sequentially to accomplish a task over

time [37]. From an ad network’s1 perspective these develop-
ments create a challenging environment as they increase the
complexity of targeting advertising to specific users. Attribut-
ing conversions of ads to actual purchases and frequency
capping to avoid showing a user the same ad over and over
again becomes more difficult as well. However, there is a
solution to these challenges: cross-device tracking. This tech-
nique presents a fundamental shift from device tracking to
people tracking. As shown in Figure 1, it principally allows
ad networks to follow a user on his or her online journey
through all devices. However, at the same time, cross-device
tracking of users is potentially more privacy-invasive than
the tracking of individual devices without connecting them.
In this study we are exploring the emerging cross-device
tracking ecosystem from a privacy perspective. Particularly,
we are interested in studying the tracking techniques used
by cross-device companies,2 understanding the extent to

which cross-device tracking occurs on desktop and mobile
devices, and evaluating the privacy implications of machine
learning applications to cross-device data. We understand
cross-device tracking to mean the tracing of an individual’s
usage of the Internet on multiple devices and combining all
resulting information into one comprehensive user profile.
Cross-device tracking exists in a deterministic and
probabilistic variant. The former is based on a first-party
relationship that often permits user identification with
certainty, for example, when a user logs into a social network
account from multiple devices. For the majority of our study
we focus on probabilistic cross-device tracking, which is
used by services that are limited to a third-party relationship
with users. To that end, ad networks and analytics services
oftentimes cooperate with web and app publishers that
have a first-party user relationship and deploy tracking
mechanisms on their properties. Applying machine learning
they then correlate the various data streams to identify those
belonging to the same users. Probabilistic and deterministic
cross-device tracking approaches are often combined as
companies of different provenance collaborate and exchange
data [32]. While we examine cross-device tracking via
HTTP cookies, pixel tags, and other traditional mechanisms,
such tracking can also occur via ultrasound signals [7,31,59]
or other side channels, which we do not examine here.
As some cross-device companies match billions of
devices [22] and social networks have cross-device function-
ality naturally built into their systems lawmakers began to
take notice. In particular, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) hosted a cross-device workshop [29] facilitating
an initial public discussion on the privacy implications of
this form of Internet tracking. The regulators discussed
with industry representatives, academics, and various other
stakeholders privacy risks, consumer transparency, and
effective industry self-regulation. They followed up with
privacy recommendations for cross-device companies [32].
As evidenced by a recent case on cross-device tracking via
ultrasound signals and the withdrawal of the service from the
U.S. market, the FTC is determined to enforce the existing
laws and regulations [31, 32], however, is hampered by
insufficient insight into the used technologies [30].
In this study we are exploring cross-device tracking
through the lens of privacy contributing the following:
1. By means of a brief case study we introduce a method
for detecting cross-device trackers. We find statistical
significance for various ad networks’ capabilities of
targeting mobile users on their desktop. (§ 3.)
2. We make publicly available a cross-device tracking
dataset as well as software that we used for collecting
the data.3 We give a statistical overview of cross-device
usage patterns for the users in our dataset. (§ 4.)
3The dataset and software can be found at https://github.com/
SebastianZimmeck/Cross_Device_Tracking.
3. We design a basic algorithm and evaluate features
and parameters for probabilistic cross-device tracking
based on relevant patent and other industry documents.
Using IP addresses, web domains, and app domains
our techniques achieve an F-1 score of 0.91 on the
collected data. (§ 5.)
4. Leveraging our dataset we analyze how the availability
of both mobile and desktop data may impact the
prediction of users’ demographics and interests.
Specifically, we examine predictions for gender and
interest in finance. (§ 6.)
5. Based on our dataset we calculate the penetration of
cross-device tracking on the Internet and conclude
that some cross-device companies seem to have broad
insight into Internet users’ cross-device usage. (§ 7.)
6. Finally, we explore the efficacy of the industry’s self-
regulation and find that some cross-device companies
do not transparently disclose their practices. (§ 8.)
2 Related Work
Our study is based on work in online tracking (§ 2.1), human-
computer interaction (§ 2.2), and machine learning (§ 2.3).
2.1 Online Tracking
Much research was published on online tracking. Notably,
Roesner et al. [72] developed a tracker taxonomy and exam-
ined how tracking occurs in the wild. Lerner et al. [56] pro-
vided a historical perspective of tracker evolution over time.
However, few existing efforts discuss tracking across devices.
Similar to traditional tracking such cross-device tracking
requires the identification of individual users’ browser
instances. In this regard, Englehardt et al. [27] point out that
cookies allow for linking a user’s visits to different websites
even if his or her device IP address varies. They conducted
a large-scale measurement of traditional online tracking
using their OpenWPM platform [26]. Cross-device tracking
further requires the correlation of users’ different devices.
As Olejnik et al. [67] remarked, browsing histories could
potentially identify the same user across multiple devices.
In the closest work to ours Brookman and his co-authors
from the FTC [11] examine the potential for device
correlation by surveying the occurrence of cross-device
trackers on 100 popular websites. They also evaluate the
extent to which cross-device companies notify users of their
practices. While this inquiry into privacy transparency is
part of our study as well (§ 8), we extend their work. In
particular, we provide statistical support for the occurrence
of cross-device tracking (§ 3), evaluate cross-device tracking
techniques (§ 5), analyze the potential increase in learning
power from cross-device data (§ 6), and examine the
penetration of cross-device trackers (§ 7); all on real user
data (§ 4). Our study is also complementary to the work of

Mavroudis et al. [59] and Arp et al. [7], who present analyses,
attacks, and defenses for ultrasound-based cross-device
tracking. We are exploring cross-device tracking based on
cookies and other traditional tracking mechanisms.
If a browser does not accept cookies, it still can be tracked
via device fingerprinting as initially shown by Kohno et
al. [51], Eckersley et al. [25], and extensively surveyed by
Lerner et al. [56]. Kurtz et al. [52] and Guly´as et al. [39]
showed that mobile device fingerprints are often unique, dis-
tinguishable, and re-identifiable. Fingerprinting can be based
on sensors [19] and, notably for our purposes, can be em-
ployed across browsers [15]. With their FPDetective Acar et
al. [2] conducted a large-scale study of device fingerprinting.
Nikiforakis et al. [66] provided insight into the practices of
three popular browser-fingerprinting libraries and introduced
PriVaricator [65], which is a defense against browser finger-
printing based on randomization. Three advanced tracking
mechanisms—canvas fingerprinting, evercookies, and use of
cookie syncing—were investigated by Acar et al. [1]. In our
study we are now exploring the extent to which fingerprinting
can play a role in cross-device tracking (§§ 5.1, 7.1). Various
works on website fingerprinting [12,13,17,41,44,69] inform
our study in this regard as well.
As we conduct a first cross-device tracking data flow
experiment our work also relates to similar experiments and
methodologies in other areas of online tracking. Particularly,
our work relates to the study of Meng et al. [60], who
showed that there is a correlation between Google ads and
users’ profiles and evaluated the likelihood of learning users’
sensitive information. Focusing on Google as well, L´ecuyer
et al. [54, 55] were able to show a correlation between
users’ e-mail content and ads served to them. Further, Book
and Wallach [10] collected a set of about 225K ads on 32
simulated devices and analyzed how the ads were targeted
by correlating them to targeting profiles. In addition, Zarras
et al. [85] performed a large-scale study on the security
of ad serving, and Meng et al. [61] presented an ad fraud
attack that enables publishers to increase their ad revenue.
In our experiment we follow the recommendations given
for information flow experiments by Tschantz et al [81].
2.2 Human-Computer Interaction
While there are only few online tracking studies investigating
how users are tracked across devices, various efforts on
human-computer interaction are informative for our purposes.
The goal of these studies is to improve website navigation,
browser prediction of user destinations, and search result
relevance for search engines [3]. To that end, we leverage the
insight of some studies focusing on website revisit patterns
and highlighting the identifying potential of such revisits. In
this regard, Tauscher and Greenberg [78] found that 58%
of a user’s visits to websites constitute revisits. People tend
to access only a few pages frequently and browse in small
clusters of related pages. Adar et al’s [3] analysis reveals
various patterns of revisits, each with unique behavioral,
content, and structural characteristics.
Some studies took a closer look at website revisits across
devices. Tossell et al. [79] were able to detect that revisits
occurred very infrequently with approximately 25% of
URLs revisited by each user. They further found that,
compared to desktops, mobile browsers are accessed less
frequently, for shorter durations, and to visit fewer pages.
Users seem to rely on apps instead. Different from websites,
apps have a revisit rate of 97.1% driven by a high number
of visits to the five most frequently accessed apps. It appears
that mobile web use is more concentrated and narrow than
its desktop counterpart. Indeed, Kamvar et al.’s work [46]
confirms this conjecture for the use of web search.
In their quest for improving the sharing of bookmarks and
other information across devices Kane et al. [47] found that
users tend to visit many of the same domains on both their
mobile phones and desktops. Specifically, they found that a
median of 75.4% of the domains viewed on the phone were
also viewed on the desktop, and a median of 13.1% of the do-
mains viewed on the desktop were also viewed on the phone.
Despite the differing browsing habits across devices, partic-
ularly, the higher number of websites visited on desktops,
they conclude that users’ web browsing activities are similar
across devices. However, users do not use all of their devices
in the same way but rather assign them different roles, as
Dearman and Pierce [20] found. As we will explore further
(§ 6), these different roles could be a reason for why learning
about users’ interests can be more comprehensive with data
from more than one device. While the sharing of devices
can also principally impact cross-device companies’ ability
to track users across those, Matthew et al.’s study [58] found
that phones were never shared among multiple individuals
for mutual use, and computers were shared moderately.
2.3 Machine Learning
Different from traditional types of online tracking cross-
device tracking is often based on machine learning. In 2015,
Drawbridge [22], an ad network specialized on cross-device
tracking, hosted the ICDM 2015: Drawbridge Cross-Device
Connections competition asking competition participants to
leverage machine learning techniques to correlate devices to
users [23]. The competition participants were given access
to an anonymized proprietary dataset with mostly hidden fea-
tures. The competition generated various short papers [14,48,
50,53,62,71,75,82] that take the perspective of an ad network.
They focus on improving machine learning performance for
a narrow set of features; essentially, only exploiting similarity
of IP addresses. Our evaluation of tracking techniques broad-
ens this research and is centered on privacy implications.
The first place solution of Walthers [82], which reached
an F-0.5 score of 0.9, is in some ways representative for the

approaches taken in the competition. Comparable to other
participants’ solutions [14,50,53], it identified IP addresses
that devices of the same user were connected to as the most
important feature.
Intuitively, as conjectured by Cao et
al. [14], devices with similar IP footprints are more likely
to be used by the same individual. Thus, the simple reliance
on IP address history can already lead to an F-0.5 score of
0.86 [14]. However, various studies found that not all IP
addresses are equally meaningful, in particular, because the
same public or cellular IP address can be assigned to many
different users at different times [48,82].
Participants in the Drawbridge competition [23] did not
find online history particularly useful for their task. They re-
ported that correlating online history across devices provided
only minimal gain [50, 53]. This seemingly contradictory
result to the previously discussed usability studies, which
hinted at cross-device website revisit patterns as an impor-
tant feature, could be due to the fact that the Drawbridge
dataset [45] provided only app history for mobile devices.
Thus, the absence of mobile web history could be a reason
for participants’ inability to reach Drawbridge’s precision of
0.97 [22]. While the Drawbridge competition was about the
correlation of different user devices, it did not address the pur-
pose of the correlation: the prediction of users’ demographics
and interests, which we will discuss in our study (§ 6).
3 Detecting Cross-device Trackers
In order to evaluate the occurrence of cross-device tracking
in the wild we conducted an exploratory case study.
Purpose. It could be argued that our case study is aimed at
the obvious: detecting the existence of cross-device tracking.
However, we emphasize that it is our intention to show a
procedure for identifying unknown cross-device companies.
The procedure is also intended to be used for determining
whether known companies are adhering to the limits that
(self-)regulation imposes on them, in particular, as users are
given the right to opt out from cross-device tracking [21].
Our case study provides an initial
information flow
