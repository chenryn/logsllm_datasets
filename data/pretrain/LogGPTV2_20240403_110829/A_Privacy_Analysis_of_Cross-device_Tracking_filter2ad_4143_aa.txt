## Abstract
Online tracking is evolving from browser- and device-specific methods to a more comprehensive approach focused on individual users. As users increasingly access the internet from multiple devices, cross-device tracking aims to link these devices to create a unified, person-centric profile. This new paradigm, primarily used for advertising, can reveal a complete picture of a user's online activities, making it more privacy-invasive than traditional methods like HTTP cookies. In this study, we explore cross-device tracking techniques and their privacy implications. We present a method to detect cross-device tracking and analyze its prevalence using a dataset from 126 internet users. Our findings show a high matching rate (F-1 = 0.91) between mobile and desktop devices based on IP addresses and browsing history. We also examine the compliance of 40 cross-device companies with self-regulation standards and find that some are not transparent about their practices.

## 1. Introduction
A recent Google study revealed that 98% of U.S. internet users employ multiple devices daily, with 90% switching devices sequentially to complete tasks [37]. For ad networks, this trend complicates targeting and attribution, as it increases the complexity of following users across devices. Cross-device tracking addresses these challenges by allowing ad networks to follow users across all their devices, but it also raises significant privacy concerns.

In this study, we investigate the emerging cross-device tracking ecosystem from a privacy perspective. We focus on:
- The tracking techniques used by cross-device companies.
- The extent of cross-device tracking on desktop and mobile devices.
- The privacy implications of machine learning applications in cross-device data.

We define cross-device tracking as the aggregation of an individual's internet usage across multiple devices into a single, comprehensive profile. This tracking can be deterministic (based on first-party relationships) or probabilistic (using third-party data and machine learning).

Regulators, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), have begun to address the privacy implications of cross-device tracking. The FTC has hosted workshops and issued recommendations, but enforcement remains challenging due to the lack of transparency in the technologies used.

Our contributions include:
1. A method to detect cross-device trackers, demonstrating statistical significance for ad networks targeting mobile users on desktops.
2. A publicly available dataset and software for collecting cross-device tracking data, along with a statistical overview of usage patterns.
3. An algorithm for probabilistic cross-device tracking, achieving an F-1 score of 0.91.
4. An analysis of how combining mobile and desktop data impacts predictions of user demographics and interests.
5. An evaluation of the penetration of cross-device tracking on the internet.
6. An examination of the efficacy of industry self-regulation, revealing that some companies lack transparency in their practices.

## 2. Related Work
### 2.1 Online Tracking
Previous research on online tracking includes work by Roesner et al. [72] and Lerner et al. [56], who developed taxonomies and historical perspectives on tracking. Englehardt et al. [27] and Olejnik et al. [67] explored the use of cookies and browsing histories for tracking. Brookman et al. [11] examined the potential for device correlation and the transparency of cross-device companies. Our study extends this work by providing statistical support, evaluating tracking techniques, analyzing the learning power of cross-device data, and examining the penetration of trackers.

### 2.2 Human-Computer Interaction
Studies in human-computer interaction, such as Tauscher and Greenberg [78] and Adar et al. [3], have investigated website revisit patterns and their identifying potential. Tossell et al. [79] and Kamvar et al. [46] found that mobile web use is more concentrated and narrow than desktop use. Kane et al. [47] and Dearman and Pierce [20] highlighted the different roles assigned to various devices by users. These insights inform our understanding of cross-device tracking and its privacy implications.

### 2.3 Machine Learning
Cross-device tracking often relies on machine learning. The Drawbridge Cross-Device Connections competition [23] provided a dataset for participants to correlate devices using machine learning. Solutions, such as Walthers' [82], achieved high F-0.5 scores by focusing on IP address similarity. However, the competition did not address the broader implications of cross-device tracking, such as predicting user demographics and interests.

## 3. Detecting Cross-Device Trackers
To evaluate the occurrence of cross-device tracking, we conducted an exploratory case study. Our goal was to develop a procedure for identifying unknown cross-device companies and to determine whether known companies adhere to self-regulation standards, particularly regarding opt-out rights [21].

This case study provides initial information flow and detection methods, contributing to a better understanding of the prevalence and impact of cross-device tracking.
