### Configuring Off-Box Binary Security Log Files

#### Overview
SRX Series Firewalls generate two types of logs: system logs and security logs. System logs record control plane events, such as administrative logins to the device. For more information on system logs, refer to "Junos OS System Log Overview" on page 1254. Security logs, also known as traffic logs, record data plane events, such as when a security policy denies certain traffic due to a policy violation. For more details on security logs, see "Understanding System Logging for Security Devices" on page 1331.

Both types of logs can be collected and stored either on the firewall (on-box) or on an external server (off-box). This guide explains how to configure security logs in binary format for off-box (stream-mode) logging.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Specify the Logging Mode and Format:**
   - Set the logging mode to stream and specify the binary format and host.
   ```shell
   set security log mode stream
   set security log stream test-stream format binary host 1.3.54.22
   ```
   **Note:** Off-box and on-box security logging modes cannot be enabled simultaneously.

2. **Set the Source Address:**
   - Specify the source address, which identifies the SRX Series Firewall generating the log messages.
   ```shell
   set security log source-address 2.3.45.66
   ```

3. **Define the Log Filename and Path (Optional):**
   - By default, if no filename is configured, the `bin_messages` file is created in the `/var/log` directory.
   ```shell
   set security log file name security-binary-log
   set security log file path security/log-folder
   ```

4. **Configure Log File Size and Number of Archived Files (Optional):**
   - By default, the maximum size of the log file is 3 MB, and up to three log files can be archived.
   ```shell
   set security log file size 5
   set security log file files 5
   ```

5. **Enable Diagnostic Traces for Binary Logging (Optional):**
   - Use the `hpl` flag to enable diagnostic traces for binary logging.
   ```shell
   set security log traceoptions flag hpl
   ```

6. **View the Content of the Log File:**
   - Use Juniper Secure Analytics (JSA) or Security Threat Response Manager (STRM) to view the content of the event-mode log file stored on the device.

### Configuring On-Box Protobuf Security Log Files in Event Mode

#### Overview
Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a data format used to serialize structured security logs. You can configure the security log using Protobuf format. The data plane uses Protobuf to encode the log and send it to the `rtlog` process, which saves the log file based on the device configuration. By default, the log files are stored in the `/var/log/filename.pb` directory. You can decode the file data using the `rtlog` process.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Specify the Logging Mode and Format:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log mode event
   user@host# set log format protobuf
   ```

2. **Define the Log Filename and Path:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log file name file1.pb
   user@host# set log file path /var/tmp
   ```

3. **Configure Log File Size and Number of Archived Files:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log file size 5
   user@host# set log file files 5
   ```

4. **View the Content of the Protobuf Log File:**
   ```shell
   user@host> show security log file file1.pb
   ```

### Configuring On-Box Protobuf Security Log Files in Stream Mode

#### Overview
The data plane uses Protobuf to encode the log and send it to the `llmd` process. The `llmd` process saves the log file based on the device configuration. By default, the log files are stored in the `/var/traffic-log/filename.pb` directory. You can decode the log file data using the `uspinfo` process.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Specify the Logging Mode and Format:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log mode stream
   user@host# set log stream s1 format protobuf
   ```

2. **Define the Log Filename:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log stream s1 file name file2.pb
   ```

3. **Configure Log File Size:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log stream s1 file size 5
   ```

4. **View the Content of the Protobuf Log File:**
   ```shell
   user@host> show security log file file2.pb
   ```

### Configuring Off-Box Protobuf Security Log Files

#### Overview
The data plane uses Protobuf format in stream and stream-event mode to encode the log and send it to the host. The security log data is sent to the host using different transport protocols and port numbers. The host receives the Protobuf log and saves it to a file. You need to copy the `hplc_collect.py`, `hplc_view.py`, `security_log.xml`, and `protobuflog.proto` files to the host. The `hplc_collect.py` script is used to collect and save the log files on the host, and the `protobuflog.proto` file is used to decode the file data. The `hplc_view.py` script is used to view the decoded data. The files are published to `/share/juniper` and copied to the host. The `hplc_collect.py` and `hplc_view.py` scripts support the latest Python version 3.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Specify the Logging Mode and Format:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log mode stream-event
   user@host# set log stream s1 format protobuf
   ```

2. **Set the Source Address:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log source-address 10.0.0.3
   ```

3. **Define the Log Filename and Path:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log stream s1 file name proto-1og.pb
   user@host# set log file path /var/tmp
   ```

4. **Configure the Log Stream with Host and Port Settings:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log stream s1 host 4.0.0.3 port 514
   user@host# set log stream s1 transport protocol udp
   ```

5. **Configure Log File Size and Number of Archived Files:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log file size 5
   user@host# set log file files 5
   ```

6. **Configure the Log Trace File:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log traceoptions file log.trace
   ```

### Sending System Log Messages to a File

You can direct system log messages to a file on the CompactFlash (CF) card. The default directory for log files is `/var/log`. To specify a different directory on the CF card, include the complete pathname.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Create a File and Send Log Messages:**
   ```shell
   {primary:node0}
   user@host# set system syslog file security authorization info
   ```

### Configuring the System to Send All Log Messages Through `eventd`

The `eventd` process is commonly used for Junos OS logging. In this configuration, control plane logs and data plane (security) logs are forwarded from the data plane to the Routing Engine control plane `rtlogd` process. The `rtlogd` process then forwards syslog or `sd-syslog`-formatted logs to the `eventd` process or WELF-formatted logs to an external or remote WELF log collector.

#### Configuration Steps

1. **Set the `eventd` Process to Handle Security Logs:**
   ```shell
   {primary:node0}
   user@host# set security log mode event
   ```

2. **Configure the Server to Receive System Log Messages:**
   ```shell
   {primary:node0}
   user@host# set system syslog host hostname any any
   ```
   **Note:** Replace `hostname` with the fully qualified hostname or IP address of the server that will receive the logs.

3. **Delete and Recreate a Configuration:**
   ```shell
   {primary:node0}
   user@host# delete security log mode event
   ```

### Release History Table

| Release | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 15.1X49-D100 | Starting with Junos OS Release 15.1X49-D100, the default mode for SRX1500 devices is stream mode. Prior to this release, the default mode was event mode. |
| 17.4R2 | Starting in Junos OS Release 17.4R2, on SRX300, SRX320, SRX340, SRX345 Series devices, and vSRX Virtual Firewall instances, you can configure a maximum of eight system log hosts in stream mode. In earlier releases, only three system log hosts could be configured. |

| 19.3R1 | Starting in Junos OS Release 19.3R1, SRX300, SRX320, SRX340, SRX345, SRX550, and SRX550M devices default to stream mode. The factory-default configuration does not include on-box reporting to increase the solid-state drive (SSD) lifetime. |

### Configuring Syslog over TLS

#### Control Plane Logs

##### Example: Configure Syslog over TLS

**Requirements:**
- Junos OS Release 21.2R1 or later
- Junos OS Evolved Release 23.4R1 or later
- Device running Junos OS or Junos OS Evolved (syslog client)
- Syslog server

**Overview:**
- Use the TLS protocol to securely transport system log messages (control plane logs) from the syslog client to the syslog server. TLS uses certificates for authentication and encryption.

**Configuration Steps:**

1. **Specify the Syslog Server:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# set system syslog host 10.102.70.233 any any
   ```

2. **Specify the Port Number:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# set system syslog host 10.102.70.233 port 10514
   ```

3. **Specify the Transport Protocol:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# set system syslog host 10.102.70.233 transport tls
   ```

4. **Specify the Trusted CA Group or CA Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# set system syslog host 10.102.70.233 tlsdetails trusted-ca-group ca-profiles example-ca
   ```

5. **Configure the Device to Send All Log Messages:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# set system syslog file messages any any
   ```

6. **Commit the Configuration:**
   ```shell
   [edit]
   user@host# commit
   ```

**Verification:**
- Use the `show system syslog` command to confirm the configuration.
- Use the `show log` command on the syslog server to verify that the configuration is working properly.

#### Data Plane Logs

##### Example: Configure the TLS Syslog Protocol on SRX Series Firewalls

**Requirements:**
- Enable server certificate verification and encryption or decryption capabilities.

**Overview:**
- The TLS syslog protocol enables a log source to receive encrypted syslog events from network devices that support TLS syslog event forwarding. The log source creates a listen port for incoming TLS syslog events and generates a certificate file for the network devices.

**Configuration Steps:**

1. **Specify the Syslog Collector and SSL-I Profile:**
   ```shell
   [edit security]
   user@host# set log mode stream-event
   user@host# set log stream s1 format protobuf
   user@host# set log source-address 10.0.0.3
   user@host# set log stream s1 file name proto-1og.pb
   user@host# set log file path /var/tmp
   user@host# set log stream s1 host 4.0.0.3 port 514
   user@host# set log stream s1 transport protocol udp
   user@host# set log file size 5
   user@host# set log file files 5
   user@host# set log traceoptions file log.trace
   ```

**Verification:**
- Use the `show security log file` command to view the content of the Protobuf log file.
- Use the `show log` command on the syslog server to verify that the configuration is working properly.
