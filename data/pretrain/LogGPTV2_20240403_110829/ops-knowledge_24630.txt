User: Is it just about creating models that use the best fitting data store API?
For part of the data I need relations, joins and sum(). For other this is not necessary but nosql way is more appropriate.
Assistant: MySQL commands cannot be run on NoSQL. You will need to do some conversions during manipulation of the data from both DBs.
