I'm using the following to update the document title when views change:
        Preamble BDD
            Home
            Changelog
            API
It works but only when the user actually clicks on one of the links. However,
when navigating via history (i.e. the browser's nav buttons) the document
title remains unchanged and doesn't accurately reflect the current view. I am
currently using the following in my views to get around this issue but it
feels like something the Title service should be able to do if it was watching
push and pop state events:
    import {Component} from "@angular/core";
    import {Title} from "@angular/platform-browser";
    @Component({
        templateUrl: "app/home.component.html"
    })
    export class HomeComponent {
        constructor(private titleService: Title) { }
        ngOnInit() {
            this.titleService.setTitle("Preamble BDD");
            console.log("ngOnInit called");
        }
    }
Notice the implementation for ngOnInit in the component class. As I stated
above, I think the Title service should be able to do this by listening to
push and popstaate events.
Please consider adding this feature to the Title service.
