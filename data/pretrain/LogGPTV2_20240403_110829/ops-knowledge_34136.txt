User: I'm just starting out with Python, and have found out that I can import various libraries. How do I find out what libraries exist on my Mac that I can import? How do I find out what functions they include?
I seem to remember using some web server type thing to browse through local help files, but I may have imagined that!
Assistant: just run the Python interpeter and type the command
import "lib_name" 
if it gives an error, you don't have the lib installed...else you are good to go
