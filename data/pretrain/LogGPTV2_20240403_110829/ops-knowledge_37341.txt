User: I see a lot of people using django with tornado using WSGIContainer.  Does this make any sense?  Tornado is supposed to be asynchronous, but Django is synchronous.  Aren't you just shooting yourself in the foot by doing that?
Assistant: Django comes with a debug server, so i guess, using Tornado with Django, the Tornado here is the mix of Apache + mod_WSGI
