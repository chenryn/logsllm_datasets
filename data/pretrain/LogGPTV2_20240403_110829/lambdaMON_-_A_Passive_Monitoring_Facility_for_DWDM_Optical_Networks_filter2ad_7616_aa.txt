Abstract.  This  paper  presents  lambdaMON  -  a  novel  approach  to  passive 
monitoring  of  very  high  performance  optical  networks  based  on  dense 
wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM).  The  approach  offers  very 
attractive  cost/benefit  scaling  properties,  which  are  further  refined  by 
introducing  state-of-the-art  transparent  fiber  switching  equipment.  The  rapid 
pace at which we intend to implement lambdaMONs opens new opportunities 
to  apply  passive  monitoring  facilities  for  debugging,  troubleshooting  and 
performance  analysis  of  novel  protocols  and  applications.  To  the  best  of  our 
knowledge, this is the first attempt at designing a passive monitoring facility for 
optical  networks.  We  report  detailed  architectural  parameters,  measurements 
and experience from laboratory tests and initial field deployment. 
1   Introduction 
Optical networking, based upon dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM), is 
rapidly  becoming  the  technology  of  choice  for  the  high-performance  networking 
community,  as  well  as  major  national  and  international  commercial  network 
providers. 
Optical  networking  uses  individual  light  rays  (also  referred  to  as  colors, 
wavelengths,  carriers,  or  channels)  to  carry  very  high-performance  point-to-point 
connections  over  long  distances.  The  capabilities  offered  by  optical  networking 
fundamentally  challenge  traditional  means  of  time  division  multiplexed  IP  services, 
which have dominated the development of the Internet for the past two decades.  
Traditional  circuit-based  provisioning,  such  as  OC3/OC12  leased  lines,  ATM, 
MPLS,  or  virtual  private  networks  (VPN)  are  rapidly  being  replaced  by  fiber  optic 
communication  channels,  or  lambdas.  The  opportunities  for  improving  connectivity 
and  performance  between  regions,  countries,  or  very  demanding  end  user 
communities, such as the high energy physics research community, are tremendous.  
At  present,  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  the  full  impact  that  DWDM  technology  might 
have  for end-to-end networking, especially  when used to support very sensitive and 
demanding 10-Gigabits/second and quality-of-service aware user applications.

lambdaMON – A Passive Monitoring Facility for DWDM Optical Networks 
229 
With networks being rolled out at a rapid pace, new protocols being developed and 
field tested, and new applications emerging, the stakes for success are  high and the 
risks  that  have  to  be  taken  by  the  research  community  are  substantial.  A  readily 
available  monitoring  facility  is  highly  desirable  as  a  means  to  locate,  debug, 
troubleshoot and resolve potential problems. In this regard, passive systems have a 
unique  advantage:  they  explore  the  network  as  is,  without  interfering  with  the 
actual traffic data pattern as generated by end systems or as modified through 
intermediate devices, such as switches and routers. In addition, passive monitoring 
systems present an excellent means to understand and address issues at network layers 
two to seven.  
In this paper we present lambdaMON – a new passive monitoring technology that 
enables the debugging and troubleshooting of applications and protocols that operate 
over long-distance DWDM networks. While the lambdaMON is fundamentally a new 
passive network monitoring technology, it preserves the traditional means to precisely 
collect  and  analyze  workload  and  performance  characteristics  of  edge,  access,  and 
backbone network links. 
traditional  passive  monitoring  systems, 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we provide a brief 
overview  of 
their  advantages  and 
shortcomings. In section 3 we look at the specifics of DWDM technology as deployed 
in  the  field  today  and  determine  the  point  of  instrumentation  for  lambdaMONs.  In 
section 4 we outline the constraints for the lambdaMON architecture. Section 5 looks 
at implementation challenges. Section 6 summarizes the achievements in architecting 
and designing lambdaMONs. 
2  Traditional Passive Monitoring Systems 
Passive  network  monitors  interoperate  with  the  live  network  at  the  link  level  (see 
Figure 1). They are considered a vendor independent means of gathering data as they 
do not depend on features that would otherwise have to be provided by active network 
equipment operating as routers, switches,  hubs or end systems [1]. Operating at the 
medium  dependent  physical  layer,  these  OCxMON  systems  are  equipped  with  link 
layer specific network measurement cards (NMCs), which reimplement all layer one 
and  two  functions,  such  as  deserialization,  packetization  and  various  packet 
encapsulations,  and  then  pass  the  data  on  to  analysis-specific  functions,  such  as 
arrival  time  stamping,  selective  filtering  and  payload  discard  or  flow  state  analysis. 
Such  functions  are  executed  by  reconstructing  and  accessing  information  that  is 
specific to network layers three to seven. If real-time analysis applications are used, 
the monitor may deliver a complete solution by means of a graphical user interface. 
The biggest strength of passive monitoring technology (i.e., link layer dependency) 
is at the same time, also one  of its biggest  weaknesses. Every emerging technology 
advance demands that a new set of PC cards (NMCs) be developed in order to support  
a compatible interface to the network link. Passive network monitors are, by design, 
lower-cost  devices,  and  their  implementation  is  hence  based  on  off-the-shelf 
components. Therefore NMCs are typically designed and implemented after a given 
link layer technology has been rolled out in the field, and as a result they are generally

available  only  for  the  second  half  of  the  life  cycle  of  any  high-performance 
(backbone) link layer technology. This means that the use of passive monitors, so far, 
has been restricted to traffic and workload characterizations of mature networks. 
While  passive  monitors  are  extremely  powerful  once  deployed  in  the  field,  their 
widespread use faces some steep resistance for both cost and technology reasons. Being 
a per-link facility  limits their deployment to dedicated research environments  for cost 
reasons,  thus  preventing  them  from  becoming  a  more  general-purpose  operational 
network  facility.  Examples  of  larger  scale  deployment  include  the  infrastructures 
operated by NLANR/MNA and CAIDA. Perhaps the largest known infrastructure in a 
commercial setting is operated by Sprint ATL’s IPMON research group. In addition to 
the  financial  obstacles,  the  process  for  installing  fiber  optic  splitters  still  presents  a 
technical hurdle  for  most  users  new  to passive  monitoring,  and  misconfigurations are 
frequent.  At  best,  the  monitor  will  be  unable  to  collect  data  on  one  or  both  of  its 
interfaces.  At  worst,  the  network  link  itself  will  be  unable  to  operate,  or  remain 
intermittent and unreliable – unacceptable for any type of network operations. 
As a result of these obstacles, passive monitors have never been used for locating, 
debugging,  troubleshooting  and  eliminating  end-user  application,  protocol,  and 
performance  problems.  For  a  random  end-user  or  problem  the  chances  of  one  (or 
more) passive monitors being present, available, and accessible along an end-to-end 
networking path are very small. 
3   DWDM Optical Networks 
DWDM  harnesses  a  spectrum  of  lambdas  within  the  third  optical  window  (1520  to 
1620  nanometers)  for  long-distance  high-performance  data  transmission.  This

spectrum has been chosen for its low attenuation and for its ability to amplify signals 
at the optical level without the need for regeneration, which would otherwise force a 
technically expensive optical-electrical-optical conversion. 
Major  amplification  technologies  in  use  today  are  erbium  doped  fiber  amplifiers 
(EDFA)  and  Raman  pump  lasers.  Unlike  EDFAs,  which  can  be  purchased  and 
integrated  as  modules  into  the  fiber  path,  Raman  amplifiers  use  the  entire  long-
distance  fiber  span  as  a  medium,  with  the  pump  laser  located  at  the  receiver  of  the 
optical  transmission  line.  Due  to  the  way  these  amplifiers  work,  the  third  optical 
window has been subdivided into the  C (1520 to 1560 nanometers) and  L (1565 to 
1620 nanometers) bands. With the use of EDFAs, fibers spans of up to 600 kilometers 
(375 miles) can be achieved. EDFAs combined with Raman amplifiers will reach up 
to 2000 kilometers (1250 miles) for production use. 
The  use  of  lambdas  within  the  C  and  L  bands  has  been  standardized  by  the 
International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication Standardization Sector 
(ITU-T).  ITU-T  Recommendation  G.694  defines  a  grid  of  wavelengths  rooted  at 
1552.52  nanometers  (193.1  THz).  The  spacing  between  carriers  is  implementation 
dependent and includes 200 GHz, 100 GHz, 50 GHz, and 25 GHz options. The choice 
of grid spacing controls the number of channels that can be supported by any single 
channel. For instance, with a 50 GHz grid, up to 80 channels can be supported in the  
C band. Due to the modulation noise band and necessary isolation between channels, 
a  50  GHz  grid  limits  the  digital  carrier  signaling  frequency  to  about  20  GHz.  For 
technical  reasons  it  is  unlikely  (but  not  impossible  –  see  [6])  that  carriers  beyond 
OC192/10-Gigabit-Ethernet will be deployed on a 50 GHz grid any time soon. 
     DWDM  networks  are  presently  built  in  a  static  setup  as  single-vendor  single-
product implementations. The simplest configuration will involve a  pair  of   DWDM

terminals operating at either end of a bidirectional long distance fiber (see Figure 2). 
A DWDM terminal supports access to the individual carrier wavelengths by means of 
a  transponder,  which  supports  the  connection  of  traditional  carrier  class  equipment 
(SONET OC12, OC48, OC192) or local area networking gear (such as 1-Gigabit and 
10-Gigabit Ethernet devices). 
The transponder converts a traditional SONET/SDH or Ethernet LAN PHY signal 
via  a  G.709/G.975  encoder  by  employing  a  Reed-Solomon  (RS[239,255])  forward 
error  correction  (FEC)  code  to  lower  the  expected  bit  error  rate  (BER)  on  the 
transmission  link.  The  use  of  FEC  supports  the  operation  of  longer  fiber  spans 
without the need for regeneration, which in turn makes the entire system significantly
