# Author: Jörg B. Micheel

## Abstract
This paper introduces lambdaMON, a novel approach to passive monitoring of high-performance optical networks based on Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). The method offers significant cost/benefit scaling properties, which are further enhanced by the integration of state-of-the-art transparent fiber switching equipment. The rapid implementation of lambdaMONs opens new opportunities for debugging, troubleshooting, and performance analysis of new protocols and applications. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to design a passive monitoring facility for optical networks. We provide detailed architectural parameters, measurements, and experiences from laboratory tests and initial field deployment.

## 1. Introduction
Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly becoming the preferred technology for high-performance networking, both in the research community and among major national and international commercial network providers. DWDM uses individual light wavelengths (or channels) to carry high-performance point-to-point connections over long distances, challenging traditional time-division multiplexed IP services that have dominated the Internet's development for the past two decades.

Traditional circuit-based provisioning, such as OC3/OC12 leased lines, ATM, MPLS, and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), are being replaced by fiber optic communication channels, or lambdas. This shift presents significant opportunities for improving connectivity and performance between regions, countries, and demanding end-user communities, such as high-energy physics research.

As DWDM networks are deployed at an increasing pace, with new protocols and applications emerging, the need for a reliable monitoring facility becomes crucial. A readily available monitoring system is essential for locating, debugging, troubleshooting, and resolving potential issues. Passive monitoring systems, like lambdaMON, offer a unique advantage by exploring the network without interfering with actual traffic data patterns. They also provide an excellent means to understand and address issues at network layers two through seven.

In this paper, we present lambdaMON, a new passive monitoring technology for long-distance DWDM networks. While fundamentally a new technology, lambdaMON retains the traditional capabilities of collecting and analyzing workload and performance characteristics of edge, access, and backbone network links.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
- Section 2 provides an overview of traditional passive monitoring systems, their advantages, and shortcomings.
- Section 3 examines the specifics of DWDM technology and determines the instrumentation points for lambdaMONs.
- Section 4 outlines the constraints for the lambdaMON architecture.
- Section 5 discusses implementation challenges.
- Section 6 summarizes the achievements in architecting and designing lambdaMONs.

## 2. Traditional Passive Monitoring Systems
Passive network monitors operate at the link level, providing a vendor-independent means of gathering data. These OCxMON systems use link-layer-specific Network Measurement Cards (NMCs) to re-implement all layer one and two functions, such as deserialization, packetization, and various packet encapsulations. They then pass the data to analysis-specific functions, such as arrival time stamping, selective filtering, and flow state analysis.

While passive monitoring technology is powerful, it has some significant weaknesses. Every technological advance requires the development of new NMCs, and these monitors are typically available only for the second half of the life cycle of any high-performance link layer technology. This restricts their use to mature networks.

Additionally, the per-link nature of passive monitors limits their deployment to dedicated research environments due to cost constraints, preventing them from becoming more general-purpose operational network facilities. Examples of larger-scale deployments include infrastructures operated by NLANR/MNA and CAIDA, and Sprint ATL’s IPMON research group. Technical hurdles, such as the installation of fiber optic splitters, also pose challenges for new users, leading to frequent misconfigurations.

As a result, passive monitors have not been widely used for locating, debugging, troubleshooting, and eliminating end-user application, protocol, and performance problems. The likelihood of a passive monitor being present, available, and accessible along an end-to-end networking path is very small.

## 3. DWDM Optical Networks
DWDM harnesses a spectrum of wavelengths within the third optical window (1520 to 1620 nanometers) for long-distance, high-performance data transmission. This spectrum is chosen for its low attenuation and the ability to amplify signals optically without regeneration, which would otherwise require costly optical-electrical-optical conversion.

Major amplification technologies include Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) and Raman pump lasers. EDFAs can be integrated into the fiber path, while Raman amplifiers use the entire long-distance fiber span, with the pump laser located at the receiver. The third optical window is subdivided into the C (1520 to 1560 nanometers) and L (1565 to 1620 nanometers) bands. EDFAs alone can achieve fiber spans of up to 600 kilometers, while combined with Raman amplifiers, they can reach up to 2000 kilometers.

The use of wavelengths within the C and L bands is standardized by the International Telecommunication Union – Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). ITU-T Recommendation G.694 defines a grid of wavelengths rooted at 1552.52 nanometers (193.1 THz). The spacing between carriers is implementation-dependent, with options including 200 GHz, 100 GHz, 50 GHz, and 25 GHz. The choice of grid spacing controls the number of channels that can be supported. For example, a 50 GHz grid supports up to 80 channels in the C band but limits the digital carrier signaling frequency to about 20 GHz.

DWDM networks are currently built as static, single-vendor, single-product implementations. A basic configuration involves a pair of DWDM terminals at either end of a bidirectional long-distance fiber. Each terminal supports access to individual carrier wavelengths via a transponder, which connects to traditional carrier-class equipment (SONET OC12, OC48, OC192) or local area networking gear (such as 1-Gigabit and 10-Gigabit Ethernet devices).

The transponder converts traditional SONET/SDH or Ethernet LAN PHY signals using a G.709/G.975 encoder with a Reed-Solomon (RS[239,255]) forward error correction (FEC) code to lower the expected bit error rate (BER) on the transmission link. The use of FEC allows longer fiber spans without the need for regeneration, making the entire system significantly more efficient.
