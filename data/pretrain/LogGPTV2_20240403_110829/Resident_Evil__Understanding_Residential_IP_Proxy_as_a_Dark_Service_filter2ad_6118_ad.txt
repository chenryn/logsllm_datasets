TABLE III: Malicious activities related to RESIPs.
of the collected RESIP IPs are indeed residential. Also,
ProxyRack was found to have the highest fraction of non-
residential IPs (8.82%). Such non-residential IPs tend to be
re-assigned by small ISPs to hosting providers.
We further explored the dynamics of RESIPs by examining
their IPs’ relaying time (see §III-C), whose cumulative distri-
butions are presented in Figure 5(b). As we can see from the
ﬁgure, a signiﬁcant portion (90%) of the RESIP IPs exhibit a
short relaying time (870 seconds), which renders IP-blacklist
based defense on the server side less effective.
Blacklisting. We further checked whether these residential IPs
were ever blacklisted, which would allow the target server to
easily block them. In our study, we looked up these addresses
on the IP blacklists introduced in §III-D. In total, we observed
2.20% of RESIP IPs were reported by at least one blacklist.
Figure 5(a) shows the percentage of blacklisted RESIP IPs
in each service provider. We found that the portion of the
blacklisted RESIP IPs is fairly small. Among these services,
ProxyRack has the most blacklisted RESIP IPs (2.54%), which
is followed by Luminati (2.32%) and Geosurf (1.73%). When
analyzing the malicious activities they were involved in, we
found that spamming and malicious website hosting were two
mostly reported malicious activities. Also interesting, we found
that 1, 248 RESIP IPs (see Appendix IX-B) were served in
two IoT botnet campaigns Hajime [12] and IoT reaper [13].
Figure 5(c) shows the cumulative distribution of the delay
(in days) between when a RESIP IP was observed in our
research and when it was blacklisted. We found that 11.57% of
blacklisted RESIPs were captured by our inﬁltration framework
before blacklisted, so their lifetime could be (conservatively)
estimated. The average delay we observed is 22 days, with the
longest being 136 days.
Unpublished proxies. When a RESIP IP is on public proxy
lists such as Tor Relay list and public proxy aggregator, it can
be easily blocked by the target server. To ﬁnd out whether
these proxies were published online, we inspected 4 proxy
lists (see §III-D). The percentage of published RESIP IPs in
each service provider is presented in Figure 5(a). In total, only
0.06% (3,767) of the 6.2 million RESIP IPs discovered in our
research are among the 148,509 public proxies. Among all 5
providers we investigated, even the one with the most reported
proxies, ProxyRack, has just 0.16% on these lists.
B. Proxy Recruitment
Volunteer recruitment. If RESIP services are recruiting volun-
teers, there must be related web pages and software stacks that
are accessible to common users. For each service, we carefully
went through their websites, read through search engine results
for keywords such as luminati recruit, proxyrack volunteer,
and geosurf software. Overall, only Luminati was found to
explicitly recruit common users [36]. By joining Luminati’s
network, users can get their trafﬁc relayed by other members
at the cost of proxying others’ trafﬁc. To join the network,
users need to install the hola client [30], which has versions
available for multiple platforms including mobile. For other
services, we found no recruitment channels or software stacks.
Fingerprinting analysis. To further explore how RESIP
services recruit proxies, we analyzed devices behind RESIPs
through our real-time proﬁling system described in §III-C.
Speciﬁcally, in our study, our proﬁling system acquired
banners from 728,528 (11.78% out of 6.2 million) IPs observed,
indicating that these were the hosts with some ports open
for probing. Among these responding hosts, 547,497 of them
returned device types identiﬁed together with their vendor
information. Interestingly, 237,029 of them turned out to be
IoT systems, such as web camera, DVR, and printer. Figure 5(d)
presents the percentage of the IoT devices observed from each
RESIP provider’s network. Luminati was found to have the
most IoT devices (45%), followed by Proxies Online (33%)
and ProxyRack (19%).
Table IV presents the top 10 device types and top 10 vendors
for the RESIPs identiﬁed. We found that most of these RESIPs
(69.32%) were proﬁled as routers, gateways, or WAP. The
manufacturers for most of the RESIP devices were MikroTik,
Huawei, Technicolor, ZTE, and Dahua. Particularly, the device
vendor MikroTik, Huawei, and BusyBox were associated with
59.93% of the IoT devices involved.
Note that the aforementioned result is a combination of both
outside ﬁngerprinting (outsideFP) and inside ﬁngerprinting

(insideFP) results. As mentioned in §III-C, services including
Geosurf, Proxies Online, and ProxyRack support insideFP
for their sticky and half-sticky gateways. For RESIP IPs
captured from those channels, insideFP was performed on
a RESIP IP once its outsideFP revealed a NAT device (router,
WAP, etc.). Overall, we ran insideFPs on 35,808 RESIP
IPs, 12, 497 responded to our probings, and 10,964 further
had their associated devices identiﬁed. Among them, 5,981,
which was found to relate to gateways by outsideFP, were
considered to host non-gateway devices according to insideFP.
One interesting point here is that although outsideFPs on those
35,808 RESIP IPs all received responses, only 12, 497 replied to
our insideFPs (using similar probings as outsideFP), indicating
those unresponsive RESIP hosts may actually reside behind
NAT devices. We therefore expect that the actual proportion
of non-gateway devices to be higher than that in Table IV.
Also conﬂicting devices could be found on the same RESIP
IP, particularly during host re-proﬁling. Re-proﬁling happened
rarely in our study, since we did not re-proﬁle the same IP
found in 15 days. Still we observed 195 RESIP IPs hosting
different devices, indicating that multiple RESIPs possibly
share the same IP. Besides, even in a single ﬁngerprinting, the
banners grabbed from different ports associated with the same
IP may reveal different devices. However the scenario is very
rare: only 1,083 RESIP IPs (0.20% out of 547, 497) found
in our study. When this happened, we simply assigned the IP
most popular device identiﬁed when studying the distribution
of the devices across IPs (Table IV).
One potential concern is the representativeness of our
proﬁling results as only 11.75% RESIP IPs responded to
our probings and overall 8.85% RESIP IPs had their de-
vice information identiﬁed. However, as shown in previous
studies [77] [63] [64] [61], such low identiﬁcation rate is
quite common. For example, according to the latest large-scale
probing conducted by CENSYS [43], among their probes on
0.37 billion alive IPs, only 50 million (13.5%) produced HTTP
responses, 3 million (0.8%) produced TELNET responses, 10
million (2.7%) triggered FTP responses, and 13 million (3.5%)
led to SSH responses, etc. Besides, as shown in Figure 4(b),
RESIP IPs with devices identiﬁed are distributed globally in 215
countries and regions (16,516 /16 and 196 /8 networks). This
also indicates that our host proﬁling results are representative.
In summary, our host proﬁling results indicate that rather
than joining RESIP services willingly, at least some RESIP
devices are likely “recruited” through stealthy compromise. On
one hand, none of the ﬁve RESIP services except for Luminati
provides software stacks for recruiting users. On the other
hand, many IPs ﬁngerprinted were found to host IoT devices.
Although some devices like WAPs and routers may serve as
the NAT front that covers other hosts behind the scene, others
such as cameras, printers, DVRs and media devices, etc., are
very unlikely to voluntarily join the services by their owners.

trafﬁc data (see §III-D) to ﬁnd the illicit activities the PUP-
hosting RESIP devices were involved in. Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst analyzed the trafﬁc logs of these PUPs, searching for
the domains (those the PUP communicated with) matching
the pattern of our labeled inﬁltration trafﬁc. As mentioned
in §III-A,
to our target
web server through a RESIP service were constructed in
a unique way: uuid.timestamp.providerId.gwId.raap-xx.site.
This labeling approach ensures that even when all other
payload content of these packets was discarded, still we could
identify the communication as long as the target domains were
recorded. This was exactly the case for the PUP trafﬁc logging,
which only kept the domains, and another small amount of
information, including the time when the communication was
observed. In our study, we correlated the PUP communication
with our inﬁltration trafﬁc based upon the matched one-time
domain, their timestamps (within 1 minute), and the log on
the client side, which is supposed to record the request sent
out, and the log on the server side, which should receive the
request only once. These checks ensure that there would not be
any false hit caused by, for example, trafﬁc replay. In the end,
we discovered from the PUP dataset 5,895 trafﬁc records that
accurately matched the records on our sides. Those records
cover 67 different PUPs. To better understand the 67 PUPs, we
scanned their MD5 using VirusTotal and found that 50 of them
were ﬂagged by at least one anti-virus engine, and each PUP
on average received 24.71 alarms. We then submitted these
VirusTotal reports to AVClass [75] to get the PUPs’ families.
In the end, 17 were labeled as cryptos, 10 as glupteba, and 5
as one of elex, bandit, zusy, wcryg and razy, and the families
of the remaining PUPs were not identiﬁed.
For all these 67 PUPs, we collected their trafﬁc logs from
June 2017 to Nov 2017: totally, 5 million of them covering
8,886 RESIP IPs and 4,141 devices. Table V presents 10 PUP
examples from different RESIP providers. Their MD5s are
included in Table XIII of Appendix IX. The 5 million PUP

trafﬁc logs were further used in our trafﬁc analysis (elaborated
below). Note that the above numbers are only the “lower
bounds” for the pervasiveness of PUPs across RESIP services,
given the limited device accesses our industry partner has.
Surprisingly, we found that all 5 services studied in our
research utilized PUPs to relay trafﬁc: 33 for ProxyRack, 9
for Luminati, 24 for Proxies Online, 10 for Geosurf and 2 for
IAPS Security. Particularly, our trafﬁc from Proxies Online and
Geosurf went though 9 shared PUPs, which together with other
ﬁndings (see §V-B) indicates that these services are likely all
afﬁliated with the same company. Also surprisingly, the proxy
program used by Luminati, Hola, was marked as PUPs, and
some of them (2 out of 9) were forwarding our inﬁltration
trafﬁc sent to a different RESIP provider, IAPS. This combined
with further analysis in §V-B indicates that IAPS is very likely
a reseller for Luminati’s RESIP service.
Trafﬁc Target analysis. Our access to the PUP trafﬁc log
helped us learn more about other illicit activities performed
by RESIPs. Speciﬁcally, from the 5-million trafﬁc logs of
67 PUPs, we extracted destination domains, URLs and IPs
of their communication, as well as related trafﬁc volume.
Manual analysis of top 1,000 destinations with the largest
trafﬁc volume shows most of them reside in the following 5
categories: ad (75%), searching engines (8%), shopping (7%),
malicious websites (5%) and social networks (2%). Among
ads-related domains, the majority are afﬁliate networks such as
tracking.sumatoad.com, click.howdoesin.net, www.alexacn.cc,
and click.gowadogo.com. Others are dedicated to different
ad services such as mobile advertising, in-app advertising,
video advertising, ad exchanges. Many of those ad domains
are reported to install adware on users’ devices such as
ads.stickyadstv.com, counter.yadro.ru, and adskpak.com. Those
adware altered browser homepages, generated various forms of
ads. Further, analysis of corresponding URLs of those domains
shows that most of them are in the forms of ads provided
by those domains. Examples include click.howdoesin.net,
tracking.sumatoad.com/aff c?, click.gowadogo.com/click? and
proleadsmedia.afftrack.com/click?. We also observed lots of
search queries are sent to different search engines including
Google Search, Bing Search, Baidu Search, Yandex, and also
visits to various shopping websites including amazon.com,
ebay.com, sears.com and tmall.com. Given that those proxy
services are rather expensive, with 1 GB costing at least $15,
using them for daily shopping and online search does not seem
to be reasonable. More likely were the activities related to
blackhat SEO or other online promotion operations. What is
more, some websites such as lenzmx.com and csgob0t.online
were found to be malicious in our manual analysis, in line
with the results reported by VirusTotal.
Further we found from the PUP logs the trafﬁc to known mali-
cious domains. Speciﬁcally, 9.36% of the destination addresses
were reported to be malicious by VirusTotal (68.92% are labeled
