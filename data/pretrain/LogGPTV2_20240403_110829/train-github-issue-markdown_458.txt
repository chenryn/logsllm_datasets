Hi, there is the problem with mongoose middleware definitions:  
According to the docs http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html function
signature for the hook post save is may looks like this (error: MongoError,
doc: Document, next: (err?: NativeError) => void)
    schema.post('save', function(error, doc, next) {
      if (error.name === 'MongoError' && error.code === 11000) {
        next(new Error('There was a duplicate key error'));
      } else {
        next(error);
      }
    });
But typings has this
        /**
         * Defines a post hook for the document
         * Post hooks fire on the event emitted from document instances of Models compiled
         *   from this schema.
         * @param method name of the method to hook
         * @param fn callback
         */
        post(method: string, fn: (doc: T, next: (err?: NativeError) => void,
          ...otherArgs: any[]) => void): this;
        post(method: string, fn: (doc: T) => void, ...args: any[]): this;
in other words, `error` signature was omitted
