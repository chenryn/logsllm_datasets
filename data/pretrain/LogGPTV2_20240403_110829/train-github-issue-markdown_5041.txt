Per conversation in issue #2507, IsotonicRegression appears to have regressed
due to commit `a9ea55f`.
This IPython notebook demonstrates the failure on HEAD.
I tested the following two commits with the notebook:
  * `d255866`: no difference, SUCCESS
  * `a9ea55f`: difference, FAILURE
In other words, I think we can blame the switch for `interp1d` from "linear"
to "slinear"; first thought is that 1-d spline "slinear" matrix formulation is
ill-posed for x-ties, whereas the piecewise "linear" implementation is
unaffected?
Small additional note: confirmed failure with test case where x-values are all
non-zero, e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` instead of `[0, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, so `x=0` isn't
part of the cause.
