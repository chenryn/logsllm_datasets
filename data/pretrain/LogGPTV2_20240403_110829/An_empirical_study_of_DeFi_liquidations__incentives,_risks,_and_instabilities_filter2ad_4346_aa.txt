ABSTRACT
Financial speculators often seek to increase their potential gains
with leverage. Debt is a popular form of leverage, and with over
39.88B USD of total value locked (TVL), the Decentralized Finance
(DeFi) lending markets are thriving. Debts, however, entail the risks
of liquidation, the process of selling the debt collateral at a discount
to liquidators. Nevertheless, few quantitative insights are known
about the existing liquidation mechanisms.
In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
study the breadth of the borrowing and lending markets of the
Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. We focus on Aave, Compound, Mak-
erDAO, and dYdX, which collectively represent over 85% of the
lending market on Ethereum. Given extensive liquidation data mea-
surements and insights, we systematize the prevalent liquidation
mechanisms and are the first to provide a methodology to compare
them objectively. We find that the existing liquidation designs well
incentivize liquidators but sell excessive amounts of discounted
collateral at the borrowers’ expenses. We measure various risks
that liquidation participants are exposed to and quantify the in-
stabilities of existing lending protocols. Moreover, we propose an
optimal strategy that allows liquidators to increase their liquidation
profit, which may aggravate the loss of borrowers.

1 INTRODUCTION
Cryptocurrencies are notoriously known to attract financial specu-
lators who often seek to multiply their potential monetary upside
and financial gains through leverage. Leverage is realized by bor-
rowing assets to perform trades — commonly referred to as margin
trading. It is apparent that margin trading, speculating with bor-
rowed assets in general, is an incredibly risky endeavor. Yet, the
borrowing and lending markets on blockchains are thriving and
have reached a collective 39.88B USD of total value locked (TVL) at
the time of writing1.
Loans on a blockchain typically operate as follows. Lenders with
a surplus of money provide assets to a lending smart contract.
Borrowers then provide a security deposit, known as collateral,
to borrow cryptocurrency. Because the lending and borrowing
on blockchains lacks compulsory means on defaults, the amount
of debt borrowers can take on is typically inferior to the secu-
rity deposit in value — resulting in over-collateralized loans. Over-
collateralized loans are interesting from a financial perspective, as
they enable borrowers to take on leverage.
If the collateral value decreases under a specific threshold (e.g.,
below 150% of the debt value [20]), the associated debt can be
recovered through three means: (1) a loan can be made available
for liquidation by the smart contract. Liquidators then pay back
the debt in exchange for receiving the collateral at a discount (i.e.,
liquidation spread), or the collateral is liquidated through an auction.
(2) Debt can also be rescued by “topping up” the collateral, such
that the loan is sufficiently collateralized. (3) Finally, the borrower
can repay parts of their debt. While users can repay their debts
manually, this appears impractical for the average user, as it requires
infrastructure to constantly monitor the blockchain, collateral price,
and transaction fee fluctuations. For example, even professional
liquidation bots from MakerDAO failed to monitor and act upon
price variations during blockchain congestion [1].
In this paper we make the following contributions.

Qin et al.
(1) Liquidation Models and Insights: We provide the first
longitudinal study of the four major lending platforms Mak-
erDAO, Aave, Compound, and dYdX, capturing collectively
over 85% of the borrowing/lending market on the Ethereum
blockchain. By focusing on the protocol’s liquidation mecha-
nisms, we systematize their liquidation designs. MakerDAO,
for instance, follows an auction-based liquidation process,
while Aave, Compound, and dYdX operate under a fixed
spread liquidation model.
(2) Data Analytics: We provide on-chain data analytics cover-
ing the entire existence of the four protocols (2 years). Our
findings show how the accumulative liquidation proceeds
amount to 807.46M USD, we identify 2,011 unique liquidator
addresses and 28,138 liquidation events, of which 641 auc-
tion liquidations are not profitable for the liquidators. We
show how 73.97% of the liquidations pay an above average
transaction fee, indicating competitive behavior. We find the
existence of bad debts, the borrowing positions that do not
financially incentivize borrowers to perform a close. Notably,
Aave V2 has accumulated up to 87.4K USD of bad debts by
the end of April, 2021. We quantify how sensitive debt be-
haves to collateral price declines and find that, for example,
a 43% reduction of the ETH price (analogous to the ETH
price decline on the 13th of March, 2020) would engender
liquidatable collateral volume of 1.07B USD on MakerDAO.
(3) Objective Liquidation Mechanism Comparison: We pro-
vide a methodology to compare quantitatively whether a
liquidation mechanism favors a borrower or a liquidator.
We find evidence that fixed spread liquidation mechanisms
favor liquidators over borrowers. That is, because existing
DeFi systems are parameterized to allow more collateral than
necessary to be liquidated.
(4) Optimal Fixed Spread Liquidation Strategy: We propose
an optimal fixed spread liquidation strategy. This strategy
allows liquidators to lift the restrictions of the close factor
(the upper limit of repaid debts in a single liquidation, cf.
Section 2.3) within two successive liquidations. We provide
a case study of a past liquidation transaction and show that
the optimal strategy could have increased the liquidation
profit by 53.96K USD (1.36%), validated through concrete
execution on the real blockchain state. This optimal strategy
can further aggravate the loss of borrowers.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
outlines the background on blockchain and lending, while we sys-
tematize existing liquidation mechanisms in Section 3. Section 4
provides liquidation data insights from empirical data. We discuss
how to objectively compare liquidation mechanisms and the opti-
mal liquidation strategy in Section 5. We outline related work in
Section 6 and conclude the paper in Section 7.
2.1 Blockchain & Smart Contract
Blockchains are distributed ledgers that enable peers to transact
without the need to entrust third-party intermediaries. There ex-
ist two categories of blockchains: (i) permissionless blockchains,
where any entity is able to join and leave without permission; (ii)
permissioned blockchains, which are typically composed of a group
of authenticated participants. In this work, we only focus on per-
missionless blockchains, on top of which DeFi is built.
At its core, a blockchain is a hash-linked chain of blocks oper-
ating over a peer-to-peer (P2P) network [11]. A block is a times-
tamped data structure aggregating transactions, which record, e.g.,
asset transfers. To transfer assets, users need to broadcast digitally
signed transactions through the P2P network. The so-called min-
ers then collect transactions, pack transactions into blocks, and
append blocks to the blockchain. The whole network follows a
consensus protocol (e.g., Nakamoto consensus [26]) allowing hon-
est participants to agree on a consistent version of the blockchain.
Transactions waiting to be confirmed on-chain are stored in the
so-called mempool2. We refer the reader to [10, 11] for a more
thorough background on blockchains.
Some blockchains, for example, Ethereum [36], offer generic
computation capabilities through smart contracts. In essence, an
Ethereum smart contract is an account controlled by an immutable
program (i.e., bytecode). One can trigger the execution of the byte-
code by sending a transaction, which contains the executing pa-
rameters specified by the transaction sender, to the smart contract
account. The EVM, a quasi Turing-complete state machine [8],
provides the runtime environment to the contract execution. Solid-
ity [14], which can be compiled into bytecode, is to date the most
prevalent high-level language for implementing Ethereum smart
contracts. Smart contracts are widely used to create cryptocurren-
cies (also known as tokens) on Ethereum in addition to the native
coin ETH. Notably, WETH is a one-to-one equivalent token of ETH.
To submit a transaction on-chain, a user is required to pay a
transaction fee. On Ethereum, the transaction fee equals the product
of the gas (i.e., an integer measuring the computation complexity
of a transaction) and the gas price (i.e., the amount of ETH that the
transaction sender is willing to pay for a single unit of gas). Due to
the limited space of an Ethereum block (i.e., the total amount of gas
consumed in on block), a financially rational miner may include
the transactions with the highest gas prices from the mempool
into the next block. The blockchain network congests when the
mempool grows faster than the transaction inclusion speed due to,
for example, traders place substantial orders in a market collapse.
Under such circumstances, users have to increase gas prices or wait
longer than average to confirm their transactions.
2.2 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Smart contracts allow, not only the creation of tokens, but fur-
ther the construction of sophisticated on-chain financial systems,
namely Decentralized Finance (DeFi). In DeFi, any entity can de-
sign a financial protocol, implement in smart contracts, and deploy
2 LENDING ON THE BLOCKCHAIN
We proceed by outlining the required background on blockchain
and DeFi for the remainder of the paper.
2Note that there is no universal mempool across all network participants. Every node
maintains its own mempool depending on the received transactions.

on-chain. Compared to traditional finance, DeFi presents promis-
ing peculiarities, e.g., non-custody and public verifiability [28]. Al-
though most DeFi protocols are mirrored services from traditional
finance (e.g., exchanges), a proper redesign appears to be necessary
considering the special settlement mechanisms of the underlying
blockchains. For instance, due to the limited computation capacity,
a limit order book with a matching engine, which has been adopted
in centralized exchanges for decades, is, however, inefficient on
blockchains. This leads to the invention of the automated market
maker, where traders, instead trading against other traders, only
need to interact with a pool of assets reserved in a smart contract.
Since the rise of DeFi, we have observed numerous such innovative
DeFi design, most of which, however, have not been thoroughly
studied. As a result, the risks and threats that DeFi users are ex-
posed to are still unclear, necessitating empirical research to provide
objective insights.
At the time of writing, Ethereum is the dominating permission-
less blockchain hosting DeFi. The DeFi ecosystem on Ethereum
reached a TVL of over 80B USD3, with more than 50% contributed
by lending protocols. Lending and borrowing is a popular way to
realize a leverage (amplifying the profit) in DeFi. A typical use
case is outlined as follows. A trader collateralizes 5,000 USDT (a
USD-pegged stablecoin, cf. Section 2.2.3) to borrow 1 ETH, when
the ETH/USDT price is 1 ETH = 3,000 USDT. The borrower then
sells the borrowed 1 ETH for 3,000 USDT. If the ETH price declines
to, for example, 1 ETH = 2,000 USDT, the trader can purchase 1
ETH with 2,000 USDT, repay the debt, redeem the collateral, and
finally realize a profit of 1,000 USDT. The trader at the same time
bears the liquidation risk if the ETH price increases and the USDT
collateral is insufficient to back the 1 ETH debt. In a liquidation,
a liquidator repays the ETH debt for the trader and acquires the
USDT collateral. The acquired collateral exceeds the rapid debt in
value incurring a loss to the trader. Such repayment-acquisition liq-
uidation mechanisms are adopted by most DeFi lending platforms.
However, the incentives, risks (e.g., to what extend borrowers have
lost in liquidation events), and stabilities of these protocols have
not been thoroughly studied, which motivates this work.
We outline the details of the liquidation mechanisms in Section 3.
In the following, we introduce the essential components of DeFi
that are relevant to lending protocols.
2.2.1 Price Oracle. Because lending protocols aim to liquidate col-
lateralized assets upon collateral price declines, the lending smart
contract is required to know the price of the collateral asset. Prices
can either be provided through an on-chain oracle, such as smart
contract based exchanges (e.g., Uniswap [35]), or via an off-chain
oracle (such as Chainlink [33]). On-chain price oracles are known
to be vulnerable to manipulation [30].
Flash Loan. The atomicity of blockchain transactions (exe-
2.2.2
cutions in a transaction collectively succeed or fail) enables flash
loans. A flash loan represents a loan that is taken and repaid within
a single transaction [6, 30]. A borrower is allowed to borrow up to
all the available assets from a flash loan pool and execute arbitrary
3In comparison, the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ranked the second in terms of TVL at
the time of writing, reaches 20B USD (cf. https://debank.com/ranking/locked_value).
We omit BSC in this work because BSC starts to grow from early 2021, which has not
accumulated sufficient data.
