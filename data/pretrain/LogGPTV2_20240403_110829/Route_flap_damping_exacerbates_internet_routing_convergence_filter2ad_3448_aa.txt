ABSTRACT
Route ﬂap damping is considered to be a widely deployed mecha-
nism in core routers that limits the widespread propagation of un-
stable BGP routing information. Originally designed to suppress
route changes caused by link ﬂaps, ﬂap damping attempts to dis-
tinguish persistently unstable routes from routes that occasionally
fail. It is considered to be a major contributor to the stability of the
Internet routing system.
We show in this paper that, surprisingly, route ﬂap damping can
signiﬁcantly exacerbate the convergence times of relatively stable
routes. For example, a route to a preﬁx that is withdrawn exactly
once and re-announced can be suppressed for up to an hour (using
the current RIPE recommended damping parameters). We show
that such abnormal behavior fundamentally arises from the interac-
tion of ﬂap damping with BGP path exploration during route with-
drawal. We study this interaction using a simple analytical model
and understand the impact of various BGP parameters on its occur-
rence using simulations. Finally, we outline a preliminary proposal
to modify route ﬂap damping scheme that removes the undesired
interaction in all the topologies we studied.

INTRODUCTION
Routing mechanisms that trade-off route convergence or opti-
mality for increased stability are often described in the routing liter-
ature. One such instance is the experience with load-based routing
in the old ARPAnet, where routing system stability was achieved
only by signiﬁcantly damping link metrics [1]. Similarly, Cisco
and Juniper deliberately delay route calculations in IS-IS imple-
mentations to increase stability [2]. A second instance is the default
setting of Hello timers in intra-domain routing protocols. Existing
implementations use fairly conservative values for these timers, re-
sulting in slower detection of link state changes and consequently
less routing update trafﬁc [2].
In this paper, we analyze a third
instance, BGP route ﬂap damping.
Route ﬂap damping is a mechanism designed to selectively limit
the propagation of unstable routing information [3]. It works as
follows. Each BGP-speaking router maintains a route penalty as-
sociated with every preﬁx announced by each BGP neighbor. This
route penalty increments by some ﬁxed value whenever the state of
the route changes and exponentially decays with time. In effect, the
penalty measures the instability of a route. The router uses locally
conﬁgured thresholds to decide when to suppress the route (i.e.,
not use the route because it is unstable) and when to subsequently
reuse the route. Section 2 describes the ﬂap damping mechanism
in greater detail.
Originally proposed in the early days of the commercial Internet,
route ﬂap damping is generally assumed by the operator commu-
nity to be widely deployed in today’s infrastructure [4, 5]. Fur-
thermore, it is widely held to be one of the main contributors to
the overall stability of the Internet inter-domain routing system [5]
by the operator community. However, there have been no rigorous
studies to quantify the extent of deployment of route ﬂap damping,
nor any studies to quantify the impact route ﬂap damping has on the
stability of the Internet. We plan to pursue such studies in our fu-
ture work. While the original target of route ﬂap damping was route
ﬂaps caused either by router mis- or re-conﬁguration, or by chron-
ically unstable links, the mechanism can prevent the widespread
propagation of other kinds of routing pathologies. These include
persistent route oscillations caused by mutually incompatible poli-
cies [6], as well as route changes resulting from the repeated BGP
connection tear-down and re-establishment that has been known to
occur as a result of incompatible implementations.
However, as we show in this paper, route ﬂap damping can actu-
ally exacerbate the convergence of relatively stable routing infor-
mation, sometimes by up to an hour. The intuition for this comes
from the work of Labovitz et al. [7], who showed that a single route
withdrawal can result in other routers exploring a sequence of al-
ternate paths before deciding that the destinations is unreachable.
In this paper, we show that this kind of exploration causes what
221we call secondary ﬂaps that can trigger the suppression threshold
of the route ﬂap damping algorithm. This prevents the widespread
propagation of a subsequent route announcement, resulting in the
delayed convergence of the route. We describe this phenomenon –
withdrawal triggered suppression – in greater detail in Section 3.
We conjecture that withdrawal triggered suppression explains
the tail of the convergence distribution from the experiments of
Labovitz et al. [7, 8]. Even though their experiments injected route
changes roughly once every two hours (and therefore should not
have triggered route ﬂap damping), they found that routes took
nearly ﬁfteen minutes to converge (a time constant that is consistent
with at least one set of route ﬂap damping parameter values [9]).
Furthermore, as more and more Autonomous Systems are multi-
homed today [5], one can expect greater levels of path exploration,
resulting in greater likelihood of route suppression.
In addition to describing the withdrawal triggered suppression,
we gain insight into the phenomenon both through analysis (Sec-
tion 4) and simulation (Section 5). Analysis characterizes the progress
of secondary ﬂaps and their impact on convergence in simple topolo-
gies. Simulation in SSFNet [10] studies how, if at all, various pro-
posed BGP features (such as sender-side loop detection and with-
drawal rate-limiting [7]) impact withdrawal triggered suppression.
To our surprise, topologies with more alternate paths do not neces-
sarily have a greater likelihood of exhibiting withdrawal triggered
suppression. We also ﬁnd that in some topologies, sender-side loop
detection is effective in eliminating this phenomenon. In Section 6
we analyze real traces to show that such ﬂaps that can cause long
convergence delays occur frequently.
Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of a simple modiﬁcation
to route ﬂap damping called selective ﬂap damping. It eliminates
withdrawal triggered suppression in all the topologies we studied
(Section 7). The key new idea is to ignore monotonic route changes
(as is typical in path explorations after failure) as ﬂap damping trig-
gers. Section 8 describes related work, and Section 9 concludes
with some directions for future work.
2. BACKGROUND
Route ﬂap damping, which we abbreviate as RFD, was designed
and deployed on the Internet in the mid 1990s, primarily in re-
sponse to frequent route ﬂapping. This phenomenon, usually thought
to be caused by router re-conﬁguration or by links with intermit-
tent connectivity, manifests itself as frequent BGP route changes.
Each such route change causes route recomputation and increases
the computation load on the route processor. At the time when
RFD was deployed, route processors were signiﬁcantly less pow-
erful than they are today, and its deployment led to a signiﬁcantly
more stable routing system.
RFD has been shown to be effective in ameliorating the effects
of routing instabilities other than those for which it was originally
designed. One kind of routing instability is that resulting from the
repeated tear-down and re-establishment of a BGP peering session
(a peering session ﬂap) that was a hallmark of some early BGP im-
plementations. Peering session ﬂap occurs when these BGP imple-
mentations receive BGP routing tables that exceeded the router’s
memory or receive an incorrectly formulated BGP update. Such
ﬂaps can result in frequent route changes for a large collection of
routes. RFD can suppress these until the peering ﬂap is resolved
by operator intervention. Implementations have now been largely
ﬁxed to avoid peering session ﬂaps, but route ﬂap damping remains
an important safeguard against future implementation errors that
lead to large-scale repeated propagation of routing information.
A second kind of routing instability that RFD can1 suppress are
persistent route oscillations caused by mutually conﬂicting rout-
ing policies [6]. These oscillations manifest themselves at a router
as repeated route changes. RFD can signiﬁcantly reduce the fre-
quency of these oscillations.
Today, route ﬂap damping is widely regarded as an important
contributor to the overall stability of the Internet routing system by
the operator community. To quote Geoff Huston [5]:
. . . coupled with widespread adoption of BGP route
ﬂap damping, has been very effective in reducing the
short-term instability in the routing space.
In what follows, we describe the route ﬂap damping mechanism
in some detail. To do this, it helps to have a simple model of the
way a BGP router processes routing information. We describe a
simpliﬁcation of the route processing model in the BGP RFC [11].
Each BGP router has several peers (neighbors) from each it re-
ceives routes to IP address preﬁxes over a transport connection.
Conceptually, routes received from each peer are stored in a peer-
speciﬁc database called the Adj-RIB-In. For a given preﬁx, the
router’s BGP decision process computes the most preferred route
to the preﬁx from all the Adj-RIB-Ins and stores it in the Loc-RIB.
The decision process then determines what subset of the Loc-RIB
should be advertised to each peer. This subset is stored in a per-peer
database called Adj-RIB-Out and advertised to the peer.
An important feature of BGP implementations is a hold-down
timer on routes advertised to peers. This timer, called the Min-
RouteAdvertisement timer (or MRAI timer as deﬁned in [12])
has a default value of 30 seconds. After a route to a preﬁx has
just been advertised to a peer, subsequent changes to the route are
held down until the MRAI timer expires (some vendors implement
MRAI on a per-peer, rather than a per-route basis [7]). In doing
so, the MRAI timer reduces routing instability during route con-
vergence. As Labovitz et al. have shown, it also qualitatively af-
fects the convergence process by limiting the exploration of alter-
nate routes after route withdrawal.
While the MRAI timer was designed to reduce route changes
during convergence, it clearly cannot suppress route instabilities
caused by extraneous factors (such as unstable links) that cause
ﬂaps on larger time scales. Route ﬂap damping was designed for
this and works as follows. For each preﬁx  and for each peer or
neighbor , a BGP router maintains a penalty [; ]. The penalty
changes according to two simple rules:
(cid:15) Whenever a peer ’s route to preﬁx  changes (either the
route transitions from being available to being unavailable,
vice versa, or from one route to a better route, or vice versa),
the router increments [; ]. This increment is ﬁxed, depen-
dent on the type of the change.
(cid:15) [; ] decays exponentially with time according to the equa-
tion
[; ]0 = [; ]e (cid:21)0 
(1)
where (cid:21) is a conﬁgurable parameter.
Intuitively, the penalty maintains an exponentially decaying insta-
bility history of a particular route from a particular peer.
When a router receives a route from  to preﬁx  , it ﬁrst up-
dates the penalty [; ] according to the rules described above. It
1In theory at least. The authors are unaware of actual observations
of this kind of routing instability.

then determines whether [; ] has crossed a conﬁgurable thresh-
old, called the suppression threshold. If so, it marks the route as
suppressed and inserts it into ’s Adj-RIB-In. Suppressed routes
are not used to compute the Loc-RIB. When it marks a route as sup-
pressed, it also sets a timer for the time at which the current penalty
would decay to below a reuse threshold. If the route’s state changes
before the reuse timer expires, the router cancels the reuse timer, re-
computes the penalty, and starts a new reuse timer. When the reuse
timer expires, the BGP decision process is invoked to compute the
new best route to the preﬁx. Based on the default Cisco parameter
setting (Table 1), Figure 1 pictorially depicts a route’s penalty as a
function of time and the times at which the route is suppressed and
reused for a route that ﬂaps three times with a 2 minute interval. In
this case, the route ﬂaps is suppressed for more than 28 minutes.
A typical implementation of route ﬂap damping supports several
parameters, all of which are in principle conﬁgurable:
(cid:15) A value of (cid:21), usually expressed using a half-life parameter
  – the time for the penalty to decay to half its value.2
(cid:15) A suppression threshold, which is the value of the penalty
above which the route is suppressed.
(cid:15) A reuse threshold, which is the value below which the route
is considered reusable.
In addition to the above, implementations also have a parameter
that limits the duration a route is suppressed. This is achieved ei-
ther using a conﬁgurable maximum penalty or a conﬁgurable max-
imum suppress time. Some implementations also support different
penalty increments for route withdrawals, route readvertisements,
and route attribute3 changes.
Despite the richness of the parameter set, deployment experience
has shown that connectivity problems can be hard to debug if dif-
ferent routers use different sets of RFD parameters [3]. Consider
the case where a customer’s upstream provider is multi-homed and
the provider’s backup path applies less aggressive damping than the
primary path. In this case, when the customer’s route ﬂaps, trafﬁc to
the customer might ﬂow in through the upstream provider’s backup
path which does not suppress the customer’s route, even when the
primary path is available.
2Using Equation 1, we can obtain (cid:21) from   using the equation
e (cid:21)  = 0:5
3Recall that BGP routes carry several attributes, the AS path being
one of them.
For this reason, the operator community has recommended a
