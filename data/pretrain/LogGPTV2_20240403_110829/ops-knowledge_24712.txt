**User:** I'm currently using IDLE, which is decent, but I'd like to know if there are better lightweight IDEs specifically designed for Macâ€”whether they are free or commercial.

**Assistant:** I would recommend Fraise. It is a versatile and lightweight text editor that supports a wide range of programming languages. Fraise offers features such as automatic indentation and syntax highlighting, which can greatly enhance your coding experience. Additionally, it is available for free, making it an excellent choice for Mac users. 

If you are looking for other options, you might also consider Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code, both of which are highly regarded for their performance and extensive feature sets, including robust extensions and customizability.
