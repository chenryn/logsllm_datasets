### Operational Work
The Operations (Ops) Lead collaborates with the Incident Commander to respond to incidents by applying the necessary operational tools. During an incident, only the operations team should modify the system to maintain control and consistency.

### Communication
The Communications Lead serves as the public face of the incident response task force. Their responsibilities include providing periodic updates to the incident response team and stakeholders, typically via email. They are also responsible for maintaining the accuracy and timeliness of the incident document.

For more details, refer to the National Incident Management System at [FEMA's website](http://www.fema.gov/national-incident-management-system).

### Planning
The Planning role supports the Ops team by addressing longer-term issues such as filing bugs, ordering meals, coordinating handoffs, and tracking deviations from the normal system state. This ensures that the system can be reverted to its original state once the incident is resolved.

### Command Post
It is crucial for all interested parties to know where they can interact with the Incident Commander. In many cases, a central "War Room" is established for the incident response team. However, some teams may prefer to work at their desks, staying updated through email and IRC (Internet Relay Chat).

Google has found IRC to be highly beneficial for incident response. It is reliable and serves as a log of communications, which is invaluable for detailed state changes and postmortem analysis. Bots have been developed to log incident-related traffic and alerts, making it a convenient medium for geographically distributed teams to coordinate.

### Live Incident State Document
The Incident Commander's primary responsibility is to maintain a live incident document. This document should be editable by multiple people simultaneously, with Google Docs being a common choice. The SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team often uses Google Sites. The document, while potentially messy, must be functional. Using a template and keeping critical information at the top enhances usability. Retain this documentation for postmortem and meta-analysis.

### Clear, Live Handoff
A clear handoff of the Incident Commander role is essential, especially at the end of the working day. If handing off to someone in a different location, a phone or video call can be used to update the new Incident Commander. The outgoing commander should explicitly state, "You’re now the Incident Commander, okay?" and wait for firm acknowledgment before leaving the call. The handoff should be communicated to all involved to ensure clarity on leadership.

### A Managed Incident
Let's consider how an incident might be managed using these principles. At 2 p.m., Mary, who is on her third coffee, is startled by her pager. A datacenter has stopped serving traffic, and shortly after, a second datacenter out of five goes down. Recognizing the growing issue, she engages Sabrina to take command.

Sabrina quickly gets a rundown from Mary and sends an email to a prearranged list. She asks Mary for an impact assessment, which Mary provides, noting that users are not yet affected. Sabrina updates the live incident document. When a third alert fires, Sabrina updates the email thread and asks an external communications representative to draft user messaging. She then loops in Josephine, the developer on-call, with Mary's approval.

By the time Josephine logs in, Robin has already volunteered to help. Sabrina reminds them to prioritize tasks delegated by Mary and keep her informed. Robin and Josephine read the incident document to get up to speed. Mary tries an old binary release, but it fails. Robin updates IRC, and Sabrina adds this to the live document.

At 5 p.m., Sabrina starts finding replacement staff for the evening. A brief phone conference at 5:45 p.m. ensures everyone is updated. At 6 p.m., they hand off to colleagues in another office. The next morning, Mary finds that her transatlantic colleagues have mitigated the problem, closed the incident, and started the postmortem.

### When to Declare an Incident
It is better to declare an incident early and find a simple fix than to delay and escalate the problem. Set clear conditions for declaring an incident. For example:
- Involvement of a second team.
- Customer-visible outage.
- Unresolved issue after an hour of analysis.

Regular use of the incident management framework in change management and disaster recovery testing helps keep skills sharp.

### Best Practices for Incident Management
1. **Prioritize:** Stop the bleeding, restore service, and preserve evidence.
2. **Prepare:** Develop and document procedures in advance.
3. **Trust:** Give full autonomy to all participants.
4. **Introspect:** Monitor your emotional state and seek support if needed.
5. **Consider Alternatives:** Regularly re-evaluate options.
6. **Practice:** Use the process routinely.
7. **Change Roles:** Encourage familiarity with different roles.

### Summary
By formulating and regularly practicing an incident management strategy, organizations can reduce mean time to recovery and provide a less stressful environment for handling emergent problems.

### Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure
Postmortems are essential for learning from incidents and preventing recurrence. Google's postmortem philosophy focuses on documenting incidents, understanding root causes, and implementing preventive actions. Blameless postmortems, which focus on systemic issues rather than individual blame, are a key tenet. 

#### Google’s Postmortem Philosophy
- **Goals:** Document incidents, understand root causes, and implement preventive actions.
- **Triggers:** User-visible downtime, data loss, on-call intervention, long resolution times, and monitoring failures.
- **Blameless Culture:** Focus on systemic issues, not individual blame.

#### Best Practices
- **Avoid Blame:** Keep postmortems constructive.
- **Collaborate and Share Knowledge:** Use real-time collaboration tools and open commenting systems.
- **Review and Publish:** Ensure postmortems are reviewed and shared widely.
- **Cultivate a Culture:** Introduce and reinforce a collaborative postmortem culture.

#### Activities
- **Postmortem of the Month:** Share interesting postmortems in a monthly newsletter.
- **Google+ Postmortem Group:** Discuss internal and external postmortems.
- **Postmortem Reading Clubs:** Host regular discussions on impactful postmortems.
- **Wheel of Misfortune:** Reenact previous postmortems for new SREs.

By integrating these practices, organizations can create a robust postmortem culture that enhances reliability and resilience.
