User: I would like to implement a mechanism which will provide a RESTful API that allows a client to register interest in a subject with a sever, and receive asynchronous notifications from the server after the interest is registered. In enterprise (messaging) architecture, this is known as publish/subscribe 'pattern'.
With desktop applications, this is readily acheivable - however with web applications, it is proving to be more difficult.
is there a (preferably open source) framework or library out there that allows the publish/subscribe pattern to be applied to web applications?.
Server side technology may be in any of the following languages: C, C++, PHP, Python, Ruby.
I am running on Linux Ubuntu 10.0.4
Assistant: If you know in advance you'll have a lot of subscribers (people/applications) that want notifications on a certain subject while on other hand you'll have few different subjects consider a pull technology anyway.
RSS, Atom are quite successful even though they use pull. The reason: no need to have an administration on the server of people who are subscribed, to detect who is no longer interested (client offline for a long time) or having a mechanism to get all the data out to the subscribers.
Using push, you need to do very little on the server, while the clients will only pull a small amount of data everytime.
Pull costs slightly more bandwidth that's cheap anyway while it saves you a lot on CPU and software maintanance which is quite expensive.
