## Problem
I build dashboards on a ‚Äúdev‚Äù instance, export them, and import the archive on
the ‚Äúprod‚Äù one; all via CLI.  
I grant access to these dashboards to certain roles using RBAC ‚Äî i.e. I edit
dashboard properties and add one (or more) user group(s) to the ‚ÄúRole‚Äù
selector (e.g. `guest` in the example below):

However, **the dashboard's YAML file in the export does not include any
mention of the role(s) I grant access to**.
So I then need to grant access to these roles again, after the exported
archive get imported on ‚Äúprod‚Äù.
## Wished solution
I would like that **the imported dashboards grant the same RBAC authorisations
as their exported counterpart**.
Practically, this means that I would like to:
  * be able to track RBAC roles on the YAML file of an exported dashboard,
  * be able to set RBAC roles of an imported dashboard, based on the imported YAML file data.
## Alternative
Manual work‚Ä¶ but I'm afraid I'm lazy üòâ
## Additional context
Both dev and prod are running Superset 1.3.2, alongside the following feature
flags:
    FEATURE_FLAGS = {
