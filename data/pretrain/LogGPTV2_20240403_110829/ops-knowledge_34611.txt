User: In the Linux operating system, how to view the list of currently running processes?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to view the list of currently running processes: 1. ps command: display the current system process status and active process list `ps aux` 2. top command: display the running process list and process information in real time `top` 3 .htop command: similar to the top command, but more intuitive and easy to use `htop` 4. pstree command: display the current system process and the relationship between them in a tree structure `pstree` The above commands need to be run with administrator or root privileges to view all processes.
