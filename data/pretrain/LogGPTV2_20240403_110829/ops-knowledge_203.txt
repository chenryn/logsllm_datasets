User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What are the techniques to detect malware call home/beaconing activities? It is very common for active malware to "call home" (or beaconing), either to fetch updates and instructions or to send back stolen information.. 

In an internal network where web access to the Internet must go through a proxy, the traffic that doesn't pass through the proxy and by default is dropped by the gateway firewall could be valuable to detect malware call-home activities. 

What are the techniques to detect malware call home/beaconing activities?

Assistant: There are a number of ways to do this, largely depending on the logs available, the exact nature of your network and the strain of malware you're infected with.

Malware can and will use your proxy, it can and will use your nameservers, it can and will run under the context of a normal user.

If you're effectively going in blind, with no indicators of concern, you could use the below to pick out potential malware traffic;


Web traffic to a domain no other device is communicating with
Web traffic to domains with known risky TLDs (.top, .gq for example)
Large amounts of DNS traffic originating from a user endpoint
Periodic traffic which calls out with a precise interval
Proxy traffic on odd ports
Proxy traffic which remains out of hours
HTTP traffic with commands within the URI (i.e, a web shell)
Unusual user agent strings
