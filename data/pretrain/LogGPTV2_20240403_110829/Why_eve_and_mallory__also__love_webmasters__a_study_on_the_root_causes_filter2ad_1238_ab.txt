Actively crawling X.509 certiﬁcates for the complete IPv4
space such as Holz et al.[5] and the EFF SSL observatory
resulted in a comprehensive map of IPv4 addresses and cor-
responding X.509 certiﬁcates - in this case one cannot deduce
for which hostname the certiﬁcate was conﬁgured, hence
post-validation does not allow for hostname veriﬁcation. (2)
Passively recording X.509 certiﬁcates similar to Akhawe et
al. [1] only collects X.509 certiﬁcates for the websites their
users visit - although they collected both X.509 certiﬁcates
and SNI4 values for the corresponding SSL handshakes, they
might have missed an essential part of the HTTPS-enabled
part of the Internet. The X.509 certiﬁcate body of Google’s
webcrawler provides both, an encompassing list of X.509 cer-
tiﬁcates and their corresponding hostnames of the publicly
available part of the Internet and the possibility to perform
all three steps of X.509 certiﬁcate validation in postprocess-
ing steps: (1) CA signature validation, (2) expiration checks
and (3) hostname veriﬁcation. We used the webcrawler’s
certiﬁcate body and performed the following steps to select
candidates for our study: Firstly, we re-validated all X.509
certiﬁcates, using the NSS library as proposed by Akhawe
et al. [1] which gave us the following results:
Error Type

Self-Signed

#Certiﬁcates
3,876,497
89,981
309,350
146,941
64,694
(86.38%)
(2.0%)
(6.89%)
(3.27%)
(1.44%)
Altogether, our re-validation left us with 610,966 X.509
certiﬁcates that generate warning messages when users visit
the corresponding websites. We picked a random sample of
50,000 of all failed X.509 certiﬁcates 5 and subsequently re-
visited all websites of our 50,000 certiﬁcate sample to learn
the current SSL conﬁguration status of the corresponding
webserver. This left us with 46,934 X.509 certiﬁcates and
their corresponding webservers.
We decided to get in contact with all of the aﬀected web-
masters. Therefore we started by extracting email addresses
from the collected X.509 certiﬁcates. Whenever we found an
email address pointing to a Certiﬁcate Authority’s or a web-
hosting provider’s info address, we ignored it. For all other

rfc3546.txt
5we conservatively estimated a success rate of reaching 10%
of the administrators, and another 10% response rate to the
study, which would have provided us with 500 answers
email addresses, we ran DNS queries for MX entries for the
email’s domain. In case of a positive response, we stored the
email address for contacting the webmaster later. In order
to contact the webmasters for whom we did not ﬁnd email
addresses embedded in the certiﬁcate, we decided to send an
email to webmaster@domain.com. Altogether, we sent 46,145
emails to email addresses either embedded in an X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate or to the domain’s corresponding webmaster email
address. We sent 40,480 emails to PI:EMAIL
and 5,664 to embedded addresses. 37,596 of those could
not be delivered, leaving us with 8,549 successfully deliv-
ered emails. We received 755 complete responses to our
survey, a response rate of 8.83%. We decided on a set of
questions that would take only 5-7 minutes to answer, in-
cluding two free text questions why the webmasters were
using exactly this X.509 certiﬁcate on their website and the
free text prompt to report problems with the conﬁguration
and wishes to make conﬁgurations for HTTPS more usable.
We were mainly interested in the following aspects:
(1) Reasons and Use Cases for employing HTTPS:
We were interested in how the website was primarily ac-
cessed, how many users were visiting it and in which context
(e.g. commercial, private etc) the website was mostly used.
(2) Technical Knowledge concerning SSL: We asked
several questions to asses how much the webmasters knew
about SSL and if they had set it up themselves; we asked
for estimations for the pricing of X.509 certiﬁcates and prob-
lems they had with SSL.
(3) Risk Assessment Concerning Misconﬁgured SSL:
We asked how important SSL was for their website and how
strong the risk for users was due to the non-validating cer-
tiﬁcate.
(4) Complaints, Wishes and Suggestions for SSL: In
the end, we asked them to ﬁll in a free text about if they
had problems with conﬁguring the certiﬁcate for their web-
server, also asking them for complaints and ideas to “make
things better”.
4.2 Ethics
Our University has no formal IRB process, but the Pri-
vacy Oﬃcer also consults on ethical matters. The purpose of
making contact with the aﬀected webmasters was two-fold:
(1) we intended to inform webmasters of the misconﬁgura-
tion of their website and (2) kindly asked them to support
our research. However, webmasters would beneﬁt from our
email without participating in the study.
We were aware that sending emails to all candidates at once
could cause resentment in the recipients. To reduce nega-
tive side-eﬀects, we speciﬁcally contacted the webmaster of
the website by sending an email to the webmaster@domain
address that is speciﬁcally intended for questions and com-
ments concerning technical problems, as stated in RFC2142 6.
However, we felt we were oﬀering the administrators valu-
able information. Our results conﬁrm our estimation of the
situation: most webmasters reacted in a grateful or at least
friendly way, some nicely explained why we saw the invalid
certiﬁcate or thanked us for alarming them to the non-
validating certiﬁcate and some of them said they wanted
to ﬁx the SSL conﬁguration of their websites immediately.

Of the 755 webmasters, 154 (20.4%) operated websites
with an expired certiﬁcate, for 250 (33.1%) websites host-
name validation failed (13 were also expired), 160 (21,2%)
websites used an X.509 certiﬁcate issued by a CA not in-
cluded in the Mozilla truststore and 191 (25.3%) websites
operated self-signed certiﬁcates.
4.3.1 Reasons and Use Cases for employing HTTPS
The primary access method was said to be via browsers
in 681 cases, 15 by apps, 15 by embedded systems, and 44
stated they did not know. 319 webmasters estimated they
had less than one hundred visitors per month, 165 estimated
between one hundred and thousand, 95 between thousand
an ten thousand, 66 between ten thousand and a hundred
thousand, 19 between a hundred thousand and a million, 5
more than a million. Of the 134 webmasters who oﬀered
information about their websites’ users, 84 (62.7%) said it
was used only by themselves (primarily for administrative
purposes), 11 (8,2%) said it was mostly used by friends and
39 (29,1%) said it was used by their company and colleagues.
An important question of interest was why exactly the web-
sites operated a non-validating X.509 certiﬁcate. Of the 495
webmasters who gave information as to why the certiﬁcate
was conﬁgured in a way that would throw a warning mes-
sage, 330 said they had conﬁgured it in such a way on pur-
pose. W713, who operated a self-signed certiﬁcate, stated:
“The site is a development system not accessed by customers
or the public and the warning message “issue” is known in-
ternally.”, while W49 stated: “The X.509 certiﬁcate is used
for access to sensitive parts of the site. It is only being used
by skilled operators, i. e. people who are able to check the ﬁn-
gerprint of the certiﬁcate to determine its authenticity and
then store it for subsequent uses.” W23 on the other hand
mentioned: “Using SSL with a commercial CA issued cer-
tiﬁcate that is not under total control by myself is inherently
insecure, since every CA owner can hijack the security and
all providers that acquired an intermediate CA certiﬁcate can
do so. And in the last years we have seen how weak some
CAs are protected against cybercriminals. So it’s much more
secure for users to accept a certiﬁcate that was signed by my
own CA once and get cautious when it changes.” Another
prominent statement came from W31: “Our users are ex-
plicitly required to provision the CACert.org root CA before
visiting the website. The website generates no warning then.”
While 495 webmasters stated they use the questionable cer-
tiﬁcate deliberately, 165 webmasters said they had acciden-
tally misconﬁgured their X.509 certiﬁcate. Again, the rea-
sons for employing a non-validating certiﬁcate are mani-
fold. W218 for example stated, “I am the administrator of
a website in the medical domain that must be HIPAA com-
pliant and the HIPAA guidelines require HTTPS for web-
sites. Since we did not want to spend money on a com-
mercial X.509 certiﬁcate we decided to use a self-signed cer-
tiﬁcate.”, while W284 stated “Actually you see the warning
message because the certiﬁcate was issued for xxx.com and
not www.xxx.com. If you click through the warning message
you will be redirected to the correct website and will see no
warning message at all.”. W98 stated “I’m using one cer-
tiﬁcate for many sites (my server did not support SNI until
a recent update), so I had to list every one of them in the
alternative domain name. Since it is tiresome to add an ad-
ditional entry for every one of them to account for the the
correct subdomain, I did not bother [. . . ] But your survey
brought up to my attention this cases and I will ﬁx the issue
immediately”
The deliberate setup group self-reported a mean SSL tech-
nical knowledge of 4.08, while the misconﬁguration group
reported a mean SSL technical knowledge of 3.80. The de-
liberate group rated their data sensitivity to be a mean of
2.48 out of 5, while the misconﬁguration group rated it to
be a 2.43. 101 of the participants stated that their web-
sites were not actively in use or said that they were sure
that there were no hyperlinks pointing to their website and
hence no browser warning messages would ever be thrown.
4.3.2 Technical Knowledge Concerning SSL
We asked the webmasters who had set up the X.509 cer-
tiﬁcate for their HTTPS server. 613 stated they had set it up
themselves, 63 certiﬁcates were set up by a coworker, 12 by a
retired coworker, 68 by their service provider and 11 did not
know who set up the certiﬁcate. We asked the participants
to self-report their technical knowledge of SSL on a 5-point
likert-scale between very low and very high. 12 self-reported
their SSL knowledge as very low, while 236 said their tech-
nical knowledge of SSL was very high.
In the mean they
rated it as a 3.96. Many administrators were uninformed
about the pricing of X.509 certiﬁcates and strongly overes-
timated the actual costs. At total of 87 (11.5%) webmas-
ters did not know their conﬁguration could lead to browser
warning messages prior to our survey (those who did know
reported a mean technical SSL knowledge to be 4.02, those
who did not reported their mean technical SSL knowledge
to be 3.50). One interesting ﬁnding was that six survey par-
ticipants stated they do not need the features provided by
CA-issued X.509 certiﬁcates. They argued that for their use
cases they did not need the authenticity features CA-issued
certiﬁcates provide but only rely on “strong encryption” to
transport sensitive data. These statements demonstrate a
lack of understanding of the SSL security features. Although
they rely on strong encryption, they oversee the fact that
without properly verifying the identity of the server, no se-
cure communication channel can be established in a reliable
way since a Man-In-The-Middle attacker could easily ex-
change the original with a malicious certiﬁcate.
4.3.3 Risk Assessment Concerning Misconﬁgured SSL
We asked the participants to rate the importance of HTTPS
for the operation of their website on a 5-point likert-scale
from not important at all to very important. 217 said that
HTTPS is not important at all, while 190 stated that it is
very important for their websites’ users. In the mean they
rated it as a 3.00. We also asked them to rate the sensitiv-
ity of the data their website serves via HTTPS on a 5-point
likert-scale ranking from 1 as not sensitive at all to 5 as very
sensitive. 252 rated the sensitivity of their data as not sen-
sitive at all, while 81 rated it as very sensitive. In the mean
they rated it as a 2.53. We also had them rate the risk the
non-validating X.509 certiﬁcate they are using poses to their
users. On a 5-point likert-scale they could choose from very
low to very high. 524 rated the risk as very low, while 23
said the risk for their users was very high. In the mean they
rated it as a 1.55 Of the 755 respondents, 612 stated their
users never complained about the occurring warning mes-
sage, 7 administrators reported they receive complaints at
least once a week, 12 received complaints on a monthly ba-
510sis, 26 on a yearly basis, 77 receive complaints less often and
21 could not remember how often they receive complaints.
