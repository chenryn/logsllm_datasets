### Actively Crawling X.5509 Certificates for the Complete IPv4 Space

Actively crawling X.509 certificates for the entire IPv4 space, as conducted by Holz et al. [5] and the EFF SSL Observatory, provides a comprehensive map of IPv4 addresses and their corresponding X.509 certificates. However, this method does not allow for hostname verification since it is not possible to deduce the specific hostname for which the certificate was configured.

### Passively Recording X.509 Certificates

Passively recording X.509 certificates, as done by Akhawe et al. [1], only captures certificates for the websites visited by users. Although they collected both X.509 certificates and Server Name Indication (SNI) values for the corresponding SSL handshakes, they may have missed a significant portion of the HTTPS-enabled internet. In contrast, Google's webcrawler provides an extensive list of X.5509 certificates and their corresponding hostnames, enabling all three steps of X.509 certificate validation in post-processing: (1) CA signature validation, (2) expiration checks, and (3) hostname verification.

### Certificate Validation and Selection

Using the webcrawler's certificate body, we performed the following steps to select candidates for our study:
1. **Re-validation of X.509 Certificates**: We re-validated all X.509 certificates using the NSS library, as suggested by Akhawe et al. [1]. The results are summarized below:

| Error Type          | Number of Certificates | Percentage |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------|
| Valid               | 3,876,497              | 86.38%     |
| Self-Signed         | 89,981                 | 2.0%       |
| Expired             | 309,350                | 6.89%      |
| Hostname Mismatch   | 146,941                | 3.27%      |
| Unknown Issuer      | 64,694                 | 1.44%      |

This re-validation left us with 610,966 X.509 certificates that generate warning messages when users visit the corresponding websites. We then randomly selected 50,000 of these failed certificates and revisited the associated websites to determine their current SSL configuration status. This process resulted in 46,934 X.509 certificates and their corresponding webservers.

### Contacting Webmasters

We decided to contact the affected webmasters. To do this, we extracted email addresses from the collected X.509 certificates, ignoring those pointing to a Certificate Authority or web-hosting provider's info address. For the remaining email addresses, we performed DNS queries for MX entries. If the query was successful, we stored the email address for later contact. For webmasters without embedded email addresses, we sent emails to `webmaster@domain.com`.

In total, we sent 46,145 emails to either the email addresses embedded in the X.509 certificates or to the domain's corresponding webmaster email address. Specifically, we sent 40,480 emails to `PI:EMAIL` and 5,664 to embedded addresses. Out of these, 37,596 emails could not be delivered, leaving 8,549 successfully delivered emails. We received 755 complete responses, representing an 8.83% response rate.

### Survey Questions

The survey included questions designed to take only 5-7 minutes to answer, including two free-text questions:
1. **Reasons and Use Cases for Employing HTTPS**:
   - Primary access method
   - Number of visitors
   - Context of website usage (e.g., commercial, private)

2. **Technical Knowledge Concerning SSL**:
   - Setup and configuration
   - Estimation of X.509 certificate pricing
   - Problems encountered with SSL

3. **Risk Assessment Concerning Misconfigured SSL**:
   - Importance of SSL for the website
   - Sensitivity of data served via HTTPS
   - Risk posed by non-validating certificates

4. **Complaints, Wishes, and Suggestions for SSL**:
   - Problems with configuring the certificate
   - Complaints and ideas for improvement

### Ethics

Our university does not have a formal Institutional Review Board (IRB) process, but the Privacy Officer consults on ethical matters. Our purpose in contacting the webmasters was twofold: (1) to inform them of the misconfiguration and (2) to request their support for our research. We were aware that sending mass emails could cause resentment, so we specifically contacted the webmaster at `webmaster@domain.com`, as specified in RFC2142. Most webmasters responded positively, expressing gratitude or explaining the reasons for the invalid certificate.
