### Managing Logger Processes

The `loggerd` command is used to start, stop, or manage the processes that run as part of the Logger software. If your Logger is installed to run as a system service, you can use your operating system’s service commands to start, stop, or check the status of the process.

#### Command Syntax
```sh
/current/arcsight/logger/bin/loggerd {start|stop|restart|status|quit}
```

#### Subcommands and Their Purposes

- **`loggerd start`**: Starts all processes listed under the System and Process sections. Use this command to launch Logger.
- **`loggerd stop`**: Stops processes listed under the Process section only. Use this command when you want to leave `loggerd` running but stop all other processes.
- **`loggerd restart`**: Restarts processes listed under the Process section only. Note: When using `loggerd restart`, the status message for the "aps" process may initially display "Process ‘aps’ Execution failed." After a few seconds, it will change to "Process ‘aps’ running."
- **`loggerd status`**: Displays the status of all processes.
- **`loggerd quit`**: Stops all processes listed under the System and Process sections. Use this command to stop Logger.

To view the processes that can be started, stopped, or restarted with `loggerd`, navigate to the System Admin section from the top-level menu bar. Under System, select Process Status. The processes are listed on the right under the Processes section.

### Uninstalling Logger

If you need to uninstall the Logger software over an SSH connection and want to use GUI mode, ensure that X window forwarding is enabled using the `-X` option. This allows you to view the screens of the uninstall wizard. If you are using PuTTY, you will also need an X client on the machine from which you are connecting to the Linux machine.

Before uninstalling Logger, stop the Logger processes by using the `loggerd stop` command, as described in the "Using Software Logger Command Line Options" section.

#### Uninstallation Steps

1. Enter the following command in the installation directory:
   ```sh
   ./UninstallerData/Uninstall_ArcSight_Logger_7.0.1
   ```
   The uninstall wizard will launch.
2. Click Uninstall or press Enter to start the uninstallation process.

### Installing Software Logger on VMware

You can install Software Logger on a Linux system or on a VMware VM. This chapter explains the steps required to install and start running Software Logger on a VMware VM.

#### Prerequisites

#### Verifying the Downloaded Installation Software

Micro Focus provides a digital public key to verify the signed software. For more information and instructions, visit the provided site.

#### Licensing

- **Trial License**: Logger comes with a limited functionality trial license valid for 90 days.

- **SELinux and SSH**: Enabled, but the firewall is disabled. Enable the firewall and add your firewall policy to allow or deny devices.
- **License File**: SCP the license to the VM and note the file name and location.
- **Installation Directory**: Install into an empty folder. Remove any files left by the uninstaller if previously uninstalled.
- **Hostname**: Must not be "localhost". Change the hostname if necessary.
- **MySQL**: Do not have an instance of MySQL installed on the machine. Uninstall it if present.

#### Installation Steps

1. Run the following commands from the directory where you copied the Logger installation file:
   ```sh
   chmod u+x ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.8316.0.bin
   ./ArcSight-logger-7.0.1.8316.0.bin -i console
   ```
2. Follow the prompts in the installation wizard to complete the installation.
