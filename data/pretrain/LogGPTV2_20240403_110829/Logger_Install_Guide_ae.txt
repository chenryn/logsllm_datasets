How Licensing Works in Software LoggerHow Licensing Works in Software Logger
Loggercomes with a limited functionality trial license  that is valid for only 90 days. To access the full functionality,  upload your EPS or GB per day license as Standalone Logger or Managed by ArcMC. See "Trial Licenses" on page11 for more information. 
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 40 of 74
Installation and Configuration GuideInstallation and Configuration Guide
If you do not have a license file, see "Acquiring a License for a Software Logger" below. Depending on your purchase order, you need a separate license file for each instance of Software Logger. A license file is uniquely generated for each Logger download. 
The type of license you have affects how the license usage restriction function works and what is displayed on the License Usage page.l For Loggers managed by ArcMC, ArcSight Management Centermanages the  license (EPS or GB per 	day) restrictions . Refer to the ArcSight Management Center Administrator's Guide for more information. 
l For standalone ArcSightLoggers, the license usage restriction  function manages the license (EPS or GB 	per day) restrictions.The license usage restriction function adds the sum of the sizes of the events received on a given day to compute the amount of data that comes into Logger per day. Logger compares that value against the daily data limit in the license. If this limit is exceeded, Logger continues to collect and store events, so that no events are lost. For GB per day license, if the daily data limit is exceeded on more than five days in a 30-day sliding window, all search-related features are disabled. You will not be able to forward, search, or run reports on the collected events until the 30-day sliding window contains five or less data limit violations. For EPS, there is no over the limit restrictions for the 45 days displayed on the graph.The license usage page (Configuration > Advanced > License Usage) lists the data stored on your Software Logger on day-by-day basis in the last 45 days for EPS ( 30 days for GB per day). It also indicates the days on which data limits were exceeded. For more information, see chapter 5 of 
. 
Once you obtain the new license, follow the instructions in the ArcSightLogger Administrator’s Guide to apply it on your Logger.Acquiring a License
Software Logger requires a license file for installation.

Standalone Logger:Standalone Logger: 
Make sure to add a separate, not re-used, license file for each Logger (License compliance will be determined by each Logger).  For more information on how to add a license in Logger, see System Admin Chapter in . 
To view more details about the current license (after Logger's installation), please go to System Admin >License & Update page and Configuration > Advanced > License Information. For more information, refer to the Configuration and System Admin chapters of the .Prerequisites for Installation
The VM has the default root password arcsight. A non-root user, arcsight, with no password, is also included.  This user is required for installation. 
Caution: For security reasons and so that you can SCP or SSH to your machine, change the root 
password and add a password for the arcsight user as soon as possible.
Make sure these prerequisites are met before you install the Logger software on the VM:l Boot up the operating system on the VM, log in, set the timezone, and do any other necessary 	configuration before proceeding with the installation.
l Configure the network on the VM as appropriate for your environment. The hostname must be 	resolvable, either by the DNS server or by settings in /etc/hosts.
l Ensure the /etc/systemd/logind.conf parameter RemoveIPC is set to RemoveIPC=no, see 	"Editing the logind Configuration File for RHEL 7.X" on page28l SELinux and SSH are enabled on the OS, but the firewall is disabled. To ensure proper access to Logger, enable a firewall and add your firewall policy to allow or deny devices as soon as possible. For more information, see "Firewall Rules" on page15. 
l Before deploying in a production environment, get valid license file. If you do not have a license file, see "Acquiring a License" on the previous page. You may need a separate license file for each instance of Logger. A license file is uniquely generated for each  download.l SCPthe license to the VM and make a note of the file name and location; you will need them during the 	installation process.
l Decide whether to install Logger while logged in as root or as the preconfigured non-root user, arcsight. 	Your installation options vary depending on which user you choose.
