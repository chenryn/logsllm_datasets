found 44 (4446) missing updates in LISP:1 (RRC:1). BGP
routing table dumps: RRC:2 refers to all BGP table
dumps, every 8 hours, from RIPE’s RRC00 (from 12/31/01,
11:36pm to 01/08/02, 3:50pm). LISP:2 refers to all BGP
table dumps from the local ISP during the same time pe-
riod. Depending on the peer a BGP routing table consists of
90, 300 up to 109, 200 entries. To eliminate artifacts due to
routing table ﬂuctuations we calculate all table statistics for
each table and then consider the mean over all table dumps.
4.2 BGP updates
The purpose of this section is to characterize BGP dy-
namics. Accordingly we start with the relationship between
two updates for the same preﬁx then move onward to update
bursts and ﬁnally propose a method for identifying session
resets. In summary, we characterize BGP updates with re-
spect to the metrics shown in Table 1.
BGP updates: Figure 4 shows the number of updates
for each two-hour period for four peers for the week long
data set RRC:1: First, some events, such as a failure of the
collection machine, e.g., the ﬁrst large spike, relative to time,
can create updates that eﬀect all peers. Other events can
create a large number of updates that inﬂuence some subset
of the peers. To eliminate artifacts due to errors in the data
collection process we eliminated all updates caused by re-
sets of sessions with the collector. Second, peers experience
diﬀerent numbers of updates during the same time period.
This indicates that local peering policies and peer location
inﬂuences the frequency as well as the kinds of observed up-
dates. Third, all peers seem to show an overall similar be-
havior in terms of update rates, except during major peaks.
Fourth, we observe few withdraws. Fifth, most announce-
ments change some BGP attribute, especially after session
resets with the collector have been removed. This conﬁrms
that the number of pathological instabilities (Labovitz et
al. [14]) has been reduced substantially.
While consecutive duplications are not all that common,
duplicate updates (same set of attributes) are rather fre-
quent, due to ﬂapping, etc. A ﬂapping preﬁx using some
route may cause the announcement of a new route, followed
by the old route, followed by the new route, . . . . To char-
acterize the process of convergence we want to know how
many updates appear before the same update is repeated.
To capture this we propose to use the concept of new, dupli-
cate, ﬂapping, re-convergence, and n-way change. Based on
the count of intermediary updates we call an update a new
change, if this is the ﬁrst time an update for a preﬁx with
this set of attributes is seen. It is a duplicate, if it is the same
update as the previous update for this preﬁx. An update is
a ﬂapping change, if there is one update in between two up-
dates with the same set of attributes. It is a re-convergent
change, if there are two updates in between and an n-way
change, if there are n− 1 updates in between. Figure 5 plots
the stacked relative distribution of updates over time
according to this classiﬁcation for data set RRC:1 and peer
C, starting from new at the bottom to > 4-way at the top.
We ﬁrst note that even during the later parts of the week
new attribute sets are introduced. Even though we observe
only 0.4% new preﬁxes, 20.8% new attribute sets are intro-
duced. While we observe a trend towards a smaller number
of new changes, it is apparent that during certain time peri-
ods spikes of new attribute sets are observed. During most
time periods we observe few duplicates, and a large fraction
of ﬂapping preﬁxes (29.7% of the total). The fraction of up-
dates that observe more than 2 updates in between is rather
substantial (33.1% of the total).
Figure 6 shows the density of the logarithm5 of the
number of updates in between reoccurrence of the
same updates for peers C, D, E and A,B of the RRC:1 and
the LISP:1 data set. The fact that the maximum number
of updates in between is larger than 1, 000 and that we need
to plot this on a logarithmic scale is in itself rather amaz-
ing. Overall this indicates that at times the time for routing

the density of the logarithm of the data facilitates direct
comparisons between diﬀerent parts of the graphs based on
the area under the curve.

convergence is quite long. This is consistent with the exper-
iments from Labovitz et al. [17]. This is also conﬁrmed by
the distribution of the interarrival times of routing updates.
Figure 7 shows the density distribution of the loga-
rithm of the time between an update and the previ-
ous update as well as the interarrival time of updates with
the same set of attributes for peer C of data set RRC:1.
From the density for consecutive updates we can see that the
interarrival times of most updates is rather small, roughly 30
seconds which corresponds to a typical setting of the Min-
Route Advertisement Interval timer [31]. Indeed 53.1% of
all interarrival times are smaller than 60 seconds but big-
ger than 20 seconds, indicating that the MinAS Origination
Interval timer, with a typical value of 15 seconds, is not
inﬂuencing the spacing of updates. The probability curve
ﬂattens as the interarrival time reaches values of around 15
minutes, indicating that the time for most routing changes
to take eﬀect (except for route ﬂap damping) is less than 15
minutes. Eﬀects of route ﬂap damping can be seen at 3− 10
minutes (ﬁrst stage) and 30min to 1 hour later stages. Inter-
estingly more than 11.8% of all interarrival times are larger
than 12 hours, an indication for changes that remain stable.
The interarrival times between new updates and their pre-
vious update is quite diﬀerent from the distribution for con-
secutive updates. Many of the new updates are stable up-
dates and fewer have interarrival times less than 60 seconds
and they are less likely to suﬀer from damping. The diﬀer-
ence between the interarrival times of ﬂapping preﬁxes and
consecutive preﬁxes is that interarrival times of ﬂaps are
much more likely to be in the 1 − 10, 30 − 60 minute range,
indicating that they are more likely to be subject to route
ﬂap damping.
The next question is what is changed by an update. We
distinguish between changes to the AS path and changes to
other attributes, such as community, the later are denoted as
“Attr”. Changes to the AS path that are only due to policy
considerations, e.g., duplication of ASes on the path, are
called “Policy” changes; other changes to the AS path are
“Path” changes. Figures 8, 9 show the stacked relative
distribution of updates over time for peer C, peer D
of data set RRC:1. We observe that most updates cause
changes to the AS path. For some peers, e.g., peer D, most
updates involve only the AS path. For other peers, e.g.,
peer C, combinations of path changes and attribute changes
explain most updates. This depends on the policy of the
peer. If the peer announces communities or other attributes,
that can be used to inﬂuence routing policy decisions, as in
the case of peer C, attribute changes are more prevalent,
as if the peer does not announce such attributes. Changes
to the AS path can either result in longer (35.3%), equal
(31.2%), or shorter (33.5%) path lengths (for peer C). The
fact that most updates contain larger or equal path length
indicates that convergence after failures and routing changes
are dominating the update process.
BGP update burst: After characterizing individual up-
dates within their context we now move to understanding
the correlations between updates. Accordingly we group
updates for each preﬁx into update bursts in the same way
as one groups packets into ﬂows. If a peer sends two updates
for the same preﬁx within a short time window, deﬁned via
a timeout, they are considered to be part of the same up-
date burst. Based on the results by Varghese et al. [35], we
use a timeout value of a bit larger than one hour (4000s).
Our motivation is that each update burst should summarize
all updates caused by one or multiple instability events and
therefore capture the BGP convergence process.
We are interested in understanding the characteristics of
update bursts such as arrival process, duration, number of
updates. Correspondingly Figures 10, 11 show the den-
sity of the logarithm of the duration and interarrival
times of update bursts for peers C/D/E (B) of data sets
RRC:1 (LISP:1). While a speciﬁc timeout value changes
the curves, we found that the general characteristics do not
change. Route ﬂap damping explains the various spikes of
the diﬀerent peers at 10, 15, 30 minutes. Since each peer is
free to use its own parameters for their routers the values can
diﬀer quite a bit and are biased by the last peer along the
path. Yet larger damping values will prevail and accordingly
its not surprising that all peers have a spike at 30 minutes.
Surprisingly the median duration of update bursts is rather
small with 113 (87) seconds for RRC:1-C (LISP:1-B) and
the 90% and 95% quantiles are less than 13.5 (15) and 19.5
(23.2) minutes. But the maximum durations are surpris-
ingly large – they span the full trace duration. The only
possible explanation is that some preﬁxes are constantly ex-
periencing updates.
While the distribution of the durations of the individual
update bursts is consistent with heavy-tailed distributions
the distribution of the interarrival times is not. Figure 11
plots the probability density of the logarithm of the
interarrival time distribution for peer C of RRC:1. To
ﬁnd such interarrival times we need at least two update
bursts per preﬁx. Observing multiple update bursts indi-
cates that multiple instability events occurred that each lead
to a “stable” route. To understand how these instability
events are related we distinguish three cases: no change –
both bursts converged to an update with the same attributes
(65.4%), failure/repair – one burst ended with a withdraw
and the other with an announcement (12.4%), attribute
change – the bursts end with announcements with diﬀerent
