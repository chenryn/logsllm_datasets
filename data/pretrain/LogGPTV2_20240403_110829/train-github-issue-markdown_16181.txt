# Environment
Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.900]  
PowerToys version: 0.18.2  
PowerToy module for which you are reporting the bug (if applicable): PowerToys
Run
# Description
PowerToys run does not search for files/folders in drives other than C:. It
does it even when I tell it specifically to search, for example, in drive S:
as seen in the picture below. Only way to get to the file/folder is to specify
the entire path to it.
# Steps to reproduce
  * open PowerToys run
  * search for a file or folder that is in a drive other than C: either by searching directly for its name, or by using the syntax "drive letter":\ >"name of the file/folder"
# Expected behavior
PowerToys run finds the file/folder and displays it in the result list.
# Actual behavior
PowerToys run only finds some unrelated results in drive C: and says that
"Access to the path '"drive letter":\System Volume Information' is denied" if
you specify the drive in which to search for the result.

ps : I've seen people using this kind of template for issue reporting... Is
there a specific place from where I can get this template or is it user
generated ?
