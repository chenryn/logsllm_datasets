B. Screening Questionnaire
Demographics:
• Age/ Gender/ Profession/ Highest completed level of
education/ Recent professional status
• Do you have an IT-security background? If yes, please
specify: ...
• Are you a software developer? If yes, since:...
• Are you a system administrator? If yes, since: ...
• Technical Score: I have a good understanding of Com-
puters and the Internet: Likert Scale from 1 (agree) - 7
(disagree)
• I often ask other people for help when I am having
problems with my computer: Likert Scale from 1 (agree)
- 7 (disagree)
• I am often asked for help when other people have
problems with their computer. Likert Scale from 1 (agree)
- 7 (disagree)
1) Technology use:
• Which of the following technologies and services below
have you used in the past year? (Check all that apply.)
Instagram,
– Social Networks
(Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn, etc)
– Online Audio and Video Conferencing (Skype, Face-
Time, Google Hangout, etc.)

Expert-speciﬁc questions:
• Have you ever written non-browser TLS code? (e.g. for
TLS certiﬁcate validation?)
• Have you ever conﬁgured HTTPS?
• How long have you been working as admin/developer?
• How big is the company that you are working for?

do you make them mostly alone or mostly with a team?
C. Interview Protocol
General:
• In your daily life, are you aware of any tools, apps or
devices where cryptography is used?
• why do you choose to use them?
• Was cryptography part of your education?
• If yes, where did you learn about it? If possible, brieﬂy
outline the basic content and topics that you heard of.
• What are your expectations when you visit a site with
HTTPS and you see the green lock next to the URL in
your browser?
• What is encryption?
1) Mental Models: In the following, I’m going to ask you
to explain your perceptions and ideas about how encryption
on the Internet works. The purpose of this interview is to
understand your views, opinions, and understanding regarding
how encryption works with respect to the technology you use
in your everyday life. Please keep in mind that there is no
correct answer to these questions - please just answer these
questions based on your knowledge and experiences. Also,
please think aloud and explain your thought process while
drawing.
• Phase 1: encryption in theory. Please draw a picture
of how you think encryption works, when you send an
encrypted message to your friend. Remember to include
all relevant persons and components into the drawing.
• Phase 2: Visiting a site with HTTPS. Imagine you are
visiting a website with the HTTPS preﬁx (e.g. your
favorite online shop). Please make a drawing of what
makes such a site different to a site with the HTTP preﬁx.
• Phase 3: Online Banking. Imagine you log into your
online banking. Usually, those sites are encrypted and
you see a green lock next to the URL in your browser.
Can you please make a drawing of what happens when
you log into your bank account. Focus on what happens
between you and your bank’s website.
2) Attacker Models:
• Why is cryptography used on the Internet?
• What information does cryptography protect?
• Who is the attacker that encryption protects you against?
[Images of NSA, person in the same WiFi, Teenage
hacker in the basement, Google, Apple, Facebook]
• Please take your drawings (from before). Can you maybe
mark where an attacker could eavesdrop?
D. Post-hoc Validity Study Protocol
General:
• In your daily life, which security practices do you apply
to stay secure online?
• Do you sometimes pay attention to the green lock icon
• Have you ever thought about what the green lock next to
in the browser?
the URL means?
• What are your security expectations when you visit a site
with HTTPS and you see the green lock next to the URL
in your browser?
1) Mental Models: In the following, I’m going to ask you
to explain your perceptions and ideas about how encryption
security on the Internet works. [...]
• Phase 1*: Visiting a site with HTTPS.
• Phase 2*: Online banking.
• Phase 3*: encryption in theory.
2) Attacker Models: [...]
