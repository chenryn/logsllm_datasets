## Abstract
The rapid growth of video viewership over the Internet is expected to account for over 90% of Internet traffic in the coming years. This surge in video traffic is placing significant stress on Content Delivery Network (CDN) infrastructure. To address these challenges, two emerging strategies—federated telco-CDNs and hybrid P2P-CDNs—have gained considerable industry attention. Using a unique dataset of 30 million video sessions from two major Internet video providers, we identify several user access patterns that have important implications for these designs, including partial interest in content, regional interests, temporal shifts in peak load, and patterns in the evolution of interest. Our large-scale measurement study reveals that synchronous viewing behavior is prevalent even for Video On Demand (VOD) content, making hybrid P2P-CDNs feasible for VOD. Additionally, we find that federation can significantly reduce telco-CDN provisioning costs by up to 95%.

## Introduction
Internet video has been consistently growing, with some reports indicating that around 51% of Internet traffic in 2011 was video. Market predictions suggest that video will comprise over 90% of Internet traffic in the next few years. The increasing video workload is placing significant pressure on content providers to efficiently distribute their content.

Today, content providers rely on CDNs to leverage their presence across different geographical locations to serve video content. However, the ever-increasing amounts of video traffic are stressing the CDN infrastructure. In this context, two emerging strategies to augment the existing infrastructure have received significant industry attention:

- **Telco-CDN Federation:** This strategy involves interconnecting the networks of various CDNs operated by telecommunications companies. This would enable users to reach CDN caches that are closer, ensuring better availability and reducing provisioning costs for participating ISPs.
- **Hybrid P2P-CDN:** This approach combines dedicated CDN servers with P2eor-to-peer (P2P) technology, providing the scalability of P2P along with the reliability and manageability of CDNs.

Given the ongoing industry efforts and working groups focused on both strategies, it is crucial to analyze the potential benefits they can offer for Internet video workloads. Our main contribution is identifying video access patterns that have significant implications for these two strategies and analyzing the potential benefits. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any previous large-scale study on the benefits of federated telco-CDN infrastructures. While prior work has analyzed the benefits of P2P augmentation, these studies were conducted before Internet video became mainstream, making it timely to revisit these benefits.

Using a dataset of around 30 million VOD and live sessions collected over two months from viewers across the United States, we characterize several video viewing patterns, including:

- **Regional Interest:** Significant population-induced differences in load across regions, with skewed access rates for live events with regional biases.
- **Temporal Shift in Peak Load:** Strong diurnal effects in access patterns, with peaks occurring at around 8 PM local time.
- **Evolution of Interest:** Exponential decay in demand for VOD objects, with varying decay rates across genres.
- **Synchronized Viewing Patterns:** Unexpectedly, synchronized viewing behavior for VOD content, especially for popular shows during peak demand periods.
- **Partial Interest in Content:** A significant fraction of users watch only part of the video, with 4.5% being "serial" early-quitters and 16.6% consistently watching videos to completion.

We develop models to capture the deployment of federated telco-CDNs and analyze the potential benefits of federation to increase availability and reduce provisioning. We also revisit the potential benefits of P2P-assisted architectures. Our key findings include:

- **Telco-CDN Federation:** Can reduce provisioning costs by up to 95%, benefiting VOD workloads by offloading daily peak loads and live workloads by handling unexpected high traffic.
- **P2P-Assisted Architectures:** Can lead to up to 87% bandwidth savings for CDNs during peak access hours, with additional savings from filtering out early quitters.

In the rest of the paper, we discuss related work in Section 2, provide an overview of our dataset in Section 3, and analyze the implications and potential benefits for federation across telco-CDNs and for hybrid P2P-CDNs in Sections 4 and 5, respectively, before concluding in Section 6.

## 2. Related Work
In this section, we discuss the key similarities and differences with respect to past work in measuring different aspects of Internet video.

### Video Performance
Previous work confirms that video quality impacts user engagement across different content genres. Many quality problems are due to spatial and temporal differences in CDN performance, suggesting the need to explore strategies for augmenting CDNs.

### Content Popularity
Studies have focused on understanding content popularity in user-generated content systems, IPTV systems, and other VOD systems. These studies aimed to enable efficient content caching and prefetching. In contrast, our work focuses on analyzing the benefit of CDN augmentation techniques, modeling the longitudinal evolution in interest for different genres and analyzing regional variations in content popularity.

### P2P
Several pure P2P VOD systems aim to provide performance comparable to server-side infrastructure at lower cost. Recent commercial efforts by CDNs have augmented their infrastructures with P2P-based solutions. Early work in the P2P space presented measurement-driven analysis on the feasibility and cost savings of hybrid-P2P technologies. Given the recent surge in Internet video, it is critical to revisit these findings in light of new viewing patterns.

### User Behavior
Previous studies show that many users leave after a short duration, possibly due to low interest in the content. We confirm these observations and provide a systematic model for the fraction of video viewed by users using mixture models and gamma distributions, highlighting key differences between live and VOD viewing behavior. We also analyze the implications of partial user interest in the context of hybrid-P2P CDN deployments.

## 3. Dataset
The data used for this analysis was collected in real-time by Conviva.com using a client-side instrumentation library in the video player. This library collects information about each session, including start time, duration, and user interaction events. The data is then aggregated and processed using Hadoop.

Our analysis is based on data from two of the most popular content providers in the US, covering over 30 million video viewing sessions over two months (January 2012 and March 2012). The video content is classified into two categories:

- **VOD:** TV series episodes, news shows, and reality show episodes, typically 35 to 60 minutes long.
- **Live:** Sports events broadcast while the event is happening, resulting in synchronized viewing behavior.

The VOD dataset includes approximately 4 million users and 14 million viewing sessions, covering 1,000 video shows. The live dataset includes around 4.5 million users and 16 million viewing sessions, covering around 10,000 different events. Both datasets exhibit a heavy-tailed Zipf distribution for overall popularity, with a few extremely popular objects receiving significant viewership. On average, users viewed 4 VOD objects and 2 live events per month, amounting to 85 minutes of VOD and 65 minutes of live content.

### Session Characteristics
To understand user behavior, we collected the following information for each session:

- **ClientID:** A unique identifier assigned to the player and stored in a Flash cookie.
- **Geographical Location:** Country, state, and city of the user.
- **Provider:** Information on the AS/ISP from which the request originated.
- **Session Events:** Start time, duration, and details on user interaction events like pausing and stopping.
- **Session Performance:** Average bitrate and estimated bandwidth.
- **Content:** Information on the content being watched, including the name of the video and its actual duration.

This comprehensive dataset allows us to analyze various aspects of user behavior and the implications for CDN augmentation strategies.
