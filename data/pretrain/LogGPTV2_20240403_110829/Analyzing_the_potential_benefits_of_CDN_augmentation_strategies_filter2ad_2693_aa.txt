ABSTRACT
Video viewership over the Internet is rising rapidly, and market pre-
dictions suggest that video will comprise over 90% of Internet traf-
ﬁc in the next few years. At the same time, there have been signs
that the Content Delivery Network (CDN) infrastructure is being
stressed by ever-increasing amounts of video trafﬁc. To meet these
growing demands, the CDN infrastructure must be designed, pro-
visioned and managed appropriately. Federated telco-CDNs and
hybrid P2P-CDNs are two content delivery infrastructure designs
that have gained signiﬁcant industry attention recently. We ob-
served several user access patterns that have important implica-
tions to these two designs in our unique dataset consisting of 30
million video sessions spanning around two months of video view-
ership from two large Internet video providers. These include par-
tial interest in content, regional interests, temporal shift in peak
load and patterns in evolution of interest. We analyze the impact
of our ﬁndings on these two designs by performing a large scale
measurement study. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant amount of
synchronous viewing behavior for Video On Demand (VOD) con-
tent, which makes hybrid P2P-CDN approach feasible for VOD
and suggest new strategies for CDNs to reduce their infrastructure
costs. We also ﬁnd that federation can signiﬁcantly reduce telco-
CDN provisioning costs by as much as 95%.

INTRODUCTION
Internet video has been consistently growing for the last few
years, with some reports showing that around 51% of Internet traf-
ﬁc in 2011 was video [3]. Market predictions suggest that video
will comprise over 90% of the trafﬁc on the Internet in the next
few years. The increasing video workload is placing the onus on
content providers for efﬁcient distribution of the content.
Today, content providers rely on CDNs to leverage their pres-
ence across different geographical locations to serve video content.
With the ever-increasing amounts of video trafﬁc, however, there
are signs that the CDN infrastructure is being stressed [31, 32]. In
this context, hybrid P2P-CDN and telco-CDN federation are two
emerging strategies to augment the existing infrastructure that have
received signiﬁcant industry attention recently:
• Telco-CDN federation is based on the recent development amongst
various CDNs operated by telecommunication companies to fed-
erate by interconnecting their networks and compete directly
with the traditional CDNs [35, 10, 19, 4]. This would enable
users to reach CDN caches that are closer. Interconnecting re-
sources across telco-CDNs would also ensure better availability
and will beneﬁt the participating ISPs in terms of provisioning
costs [4].
• A hybrid strategy of serving content from dedicated CDN servers
using P2P technology (e.g., [16, 17]) has been around for a
while in the research literature but has only recently seen trac-
tion in the industry [1, 37]. A hybrid P2P-CDN approach would
provide the scalability advantage of P2P along with the reliabil-
ity and manageability of CDNs.
Given that several industry efforts and working groups are un-
derway on both fronts [35, 10, 19, 1, 37], it is crucial to analyze the
potential beneﬁts that these CDN augmentation strategies can offer
for Internet video workloads. Our main contribution in this paper
is in identifying video access patterns that have signiﬁcant impli-
cations to these two strategies and analyzing the potential beneﬁts
of these two strategies. To the best of our knowledge, there has
not been any previous large-scale study on the beneﬁts of federated
telco-CDN infrastructures. While there is prior work on analyzing
the beneﬁts of P2P augmentation, these were done long before In-
ternet video became mainstream [16, 17], and hence were ahead
of their times. Thus, it is also timely to revisit the beneﬁts of P2P
augmentation.
Using a dataset of around 30 million VOD and live sessions col-
lected over two months from viewers across the United States, we
characterize several video viewing patterns that have implications
to these two designs including:
• Regional interest: Typically, we observe signiﬁcant popula-
tion induced difference in load across different regions (e.g.,
US East coast, US West coast, Mid-West). But, for live events
with regional biases like a local team playing a match, we ob-
serve signiﬁcantly skewed access rates from regions that exhibit
low load in the typical case.
• Temporal shift in peak load: We observe strong diurnal ef-
fects in access patterns and also conﬁrm temporal shifts be-
tween regions in the demand for VOD objects using
cross-correlation analysis. The temporal shift in access pattern
is caused by time zone differences. The video access load peaks
at around 8pm local time for each region.
• Evolution of interest: We observe that peak demand for VOD
objects occur on the day of release and the decay in demand in
the subsequent days can be modeled using an exponential decay
process.
Interestingly, overall user viewing patterns are very
different across genres (e.g., TV series, reality shows, news
shows). For example, decay rates of news shows are much
higher than TV series episodes. Also, TV series episodes have
highly predictable and stable demand from week to week (i.e.,
across successive episodes).
• Synchronized viewing patterns: While we expect synchronous
viewing behavior for live video, we unexpectedly observe syn-
chrony in the viewership of VOD objects. This is especially true
for popular shows during the peak demand period (e.g., evening
of the day of release of the show).
• Partial interest in content: We reconﬁrm prior observations
that users watch only part of the video during a session [11,
24]. For instance, in the case of VOD, a signiﬁcant fraction
of the viewers typically watch only the ﬁrst 10 minutes of the
video before quitting. We observe that around 4.5% of the users
are “serial” early-quitters (analogous to channel surﬁng) while
16.6% of the users consistently watch videos to completion.
We develop simple models to capture the deployment of fed-
erated telco-CDNs and analyze the potential beneﬁt of federation
to increase availability and reduce provisioning required to serve
video workloads. We also revisit the potential beneﬁts that P2P-
assisted architectures provide in the light of these video access pat-
terns. Our key ﬁndings are:
• Telco-CDN federation can reduce the provisioning cost by as
much as 95%. VOD workloads beneﬁt from federation by of-
ﬂoading daily peak loads and live workloads beneﬁt by ofﬂoad-
ing unexpected high trafﬁc triggered by regional events.
• Using P2P can lead up to 87% bandwidth savings for the CDNs
during peak access hours. Employing a strategy to ﬁlter out
users who quit early by serving them using P2P can alone lead
to 30% bandwidth savings for VOD trafﬁc and 60% savings for
live trafﬁc.
In the rest of the paper, we discuss related work in Section 2 and
provide an overview of our dataset in Section 3. We analyze the im-
plications and potential beneﬁts for federation across telco-CDNs
and for hybrid P2P-CDNs in Section 4 and Section 5 respectively
before concluding in Section 6.
2. RELATED WORK
In this section, we discuss the key similarities and differences
with respect to past work in measuring different aspects of Internet
video.
Video performance: Previous work conﬁrms that video quality
impacts user engagement across different content genres [20, 28].
Past work also identiﬁes that many of the quality problems ob-
served today are a result of spatial and temporal differences in CDN
performance and suggest potential workarounds via cross-CDN op-
timization [31, 32]. The quality problems these studies uncover
suggest that CDNs are stressed to deliver high-quality video and
this motivates the need to explore strategies for augmenting CDNs.
Content popularity: There have been studies to understand con-
tent popularity in user-generated content systems (e.g., [18, 25]),
IPTV systems (e.g., [13, 34, 12]), and other VOD systems (e.g.,
[27, 30, 21]). The focus of these studies was on understanding con-
tent popularity to enable efﬁcient content caching and prefetching.
Other studies analyze the impact of recommendation systems on
program popularity (e.g., [38]) or the impact of ﬂash-crowd like
events (e.g. [22]). In contrast, our work focuses on analyzing the
beneﬁt of CDN augmentation techniques and extends these studies
along two key dimensions. First, we model the longitudinal evolu-
tion in interest for different genres of video content and analyze its
implications for designing a hybrid P2P-CDN infrastructure. Sec-
ond, we analyze regional variations and biases in content popularity
and its implications for provisioning a federated telco-CDN infras-
tructure.
P2P: Several pure P2P VOD systems aim to provide performance
comparable to a server-side infrastructure at signiﬁcantly lower cost
(e.g., [14, 26, 27, 36]). There are already recent commercial efforts
by CDNs to augment their infrastructures with P2P based solu-
tions [1, 37]. Early work in the P2P space presented measurement-
driven analysis on the feasibility and cost savings that hybrid-P2P
technologies can bring [16, 17]. In some sense, these studies were
ahead of their time—given that Internet video has really taken off
only in the last 3-4 years, we believe it is critical to revisit these
ﬁndings in light of new video viewing patterns. Speciﬁcally, our
observations on synchronized viewing behavior for VOD and user
join-leave patterns lead us to question the conventional wisdom in
this space and we explore and evaluate new strategies for designing
hybrid-P2P CDNs.
User behavior: Previous studies show that many users leave af-
ter a very short duration possibly due to low interest in the con-
tent (e.g., [11, 24]). While we reconﬁrm these observations, we
also provide a systematic model for the fraction of video viewed
by users using mixture model and gamma distributions, and high-
light key differences between live and VOD viewing behavior. Fur-
thermore, we analyze the implications of such partial user interest
in the context of hybrid-P2P CDN deployments and explore new
strategies for CDNs to reduce their bandwidth costs.
3. DATASET
The data used for this analysis was collected by
conviva.com in real time using a client-side instrumentation li-
brary in the video player that collects information pertaining to a
session. This library gets loaded when the user watches video on
conviva.com’s afﬁliate content providers’ websites. The library
also listens to events from the player (e.g., seek, pause). The data
is then aggregated and processed using Hadoop [5].
We focus on two of the most popular content providers (based
in the US). These two providers appear consistently in the Top
500 sites in overall popularity ranking. Our analysis is based on
data queried over two months—January 2012 and March 2012—
and consists of over 30 million video viewing sessions during this
period. We classify the video content into two categories:
• VOD: The ﬁrst provider serves VOD objects that are between
35 minutes and 60 minutes long. These comprise TV series
episodes, news shows, and reality show episodes.
• Live: The second provider serves sports events that are broad-
cast while the event is happening, and hence the viewing behav-
ior is synchronized.
The VOD dataset consists of approximately 4 million users and
14 million viewing sessions and covers 1,000 video shows. The live
dataset consists of around 4.5 million users and 16 million video
viewing sessions covering around 10,000 different events. As in
several prior studies on content popularity [30, 12], we also observe
a heavy tailed Zipf distribution for overall popularity of objects for
both VOD and live. Whereas most objects have few accesses over
the two months, some extremely popular objects had signiﬁcant
viewership. On average, users viewed 4 VOD objects and 2 live
events during the course of a month, which amounts to 85 minutes
of VOD objects and 65 minutes of live events per month. We also
observed a few heavy-hitters who watched upwards of 500 videos
per month on these websites.
Session characteristics: In order to understand user behavior, we
look at several characteristics of individual video sessions. Specif-
ically, for each session we collected the following information:
• ClientID: The ﬁrst time a client watches a video on the player, a
unique identiﬁer is assigned to the player and stored in a Flash
cookie to be used by subsequent views.

• Geographical location: Country, state and city of the user.
• Provider: Information on the AS/ISP from which the request
• Session events: Start time and duration of the session along
with details on other user interaction events like pausing and
stopping.
during the playback.
• Session Performance: Average bitrate, estimated bandwidth etc.
• Content: Information on the content being watched, in par-
ticular, the name of the video (which we use for classifying
videos into genres) and the actual duration of the content (e.g.,
45 minute show).
