ABSTRACT
Although spearphishing is a well-known security issue and has
been widely researched, it is still an evolving threat with emerging
forms. In recent years, Short Message Service (SMS) has been re-
vealed as a new distribution channel for spearphishing messages,
which already has caused a serious impact in the real world, but has
not yet attracted enough attention from the academic community.
In this paper, we report the first systemic study to spotlight this
emerging threat, SMS spearphishing attack. Through cooperating
with a leading security vendor, we obtain 31.96M real-world spam
messages that span three months. We design and implement a novel
NLP-based detection algorithm, and uncover 90,801 spearphishing
messages on the entire dataset. And then, a large-scale measure-
ment was performed on the detected messages to reveal and under-
stand the characteristics of SMS spearphishing attack. Our findings
are multi-fold. We discover that SMS spearphishing has a signif-
icant negative impact on the real-world, and a large number of
victims have been affected. And the distribution of active illicit
types between spearphishing message and common spam is quite
inconsistent. At the micro-level, to evade detection and increase
the probability of success, adversary campaigns have evolved a
set of sophisticated strategies. Our research highlights the impact
of SMS spearphishing attack is prominent. We call on different
communities to work together to mitigate this emerging security
threat.

1 INTRODUCTION
Spearphishing generally refers to social engineering attacks that di-
rectly target specific individuals or organizations by tailored phish-
ing messages with fraudulent content. To increase success rates,
spearphishing attackers tend to collect and exploit as much personal
information as possible from victims. Then they carefully construct
customized and deceptive content to disguise as trustworthy enti-
ties. In contrast to bulk spamming, victims are more likely to be
attracted, confused and then deceived by spearphishing attacks.
Over the past decade, spearphishing has grown to become one of
the most serious and influential security threats [15]. As reported
by FBI [46], billions of dollars have been lost due to spearphishing
attacks in recent years. Adversaries were also found to spread mal-
ware [7] as well as interfering in political elections [61] through
spearphishing.
As a highly profitable attack, a wide variety of communication
channels have been known to be abused by spearphishing, includ-
ing email [25, 26], telephony [38, 59] and even social media plat-
form [52, 55]. However, recently, it has been observed that Short
Message Service (SMS) is also being used to spread spearphishing
attacks [43, 66], which has caused serious financial losses and be-
come an emerging serious security threat. As shown in the two
examples of Figure 1, adversaries would embed leaked personal
information of victims (shown in bold text) into short messages
to attract their attention, and lure victims to click on URLs or call
other contacts (shown as underlined text) for subsequent scams.
Compared with other channels, the widespread usage of cellphone
contacts increases the chances of attackers obtaining related per-
sonal information of victims and then defraud them. However, this
threat has not received enough attention from the security commu-
nity and our understanding of it is quite limited.

Prior work. Previous research has gained a suite of key features to
identify spearphishing activities, such as automated account regis-
tration (in social platform) [55] and sender spoofing (in email) [11,
25, 26]. However, the format of SMS is much less rich than social
platforms (e.g., limited text length, no hashtags) and emails (e.g.,
no attachments, no headers), thus complex clustering and NLP se-
mantic analysis are not applicable. As for SMS analysis, existing
works focus on detecting spam messages through template-based
clustering [4, 13, 22], topic analysis [36] and sending behaviors [32].
However, these methods are all aimed at common spam and can
not distinguish the “high-risk” spearphishing attacks from them.
Therefore, detecting and characterizing SMS spearphishing attacks
is by no means a trivial task.
Research questions. In this paper, we report the first systematic
study on SMS spearphishing attacks to answer a set of questions
that are critical to understanding its security risks, including: What
are the characteristics of SMS spearphishing attacks? How many end-
users witness spearphishing SMS? Have the adversary campaigns
evolved into sophisticated strategies? And finally, how to mitigate this
emerging threat?
Our study. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly avail-
able dataset for SMS spearphishing analysis. We made this study
possible by cooperating with 360 Mobile Safe, a leading security
application with millions of monthly active users in China [10].
The application is developed for the android platform and provides
spam detection functions. It collected 31.96 million fraudulent spam
message detection logs in three months, and provided this dataset
to us as the basis for our research. We then manually identified
1,196 spearphishing messages as ground-truth by inspecting 50,000
randomly selected messages. The labeling process was also assisted
by senior security experts, which is the first and essential step in
this study.
To propose a scalable detection scheme, we conducted an em-
pirical study leveraging the above dataset and gained three key
observations of spearphishing SMS, including luring information,
exploiting payloads and fixed syntactic. Then a novel detection sys-
tem was proposed based on the above observations with a preci-
sion of 96.16% on the labeled dataset. We then ran this system on
the entire fraudulent message dataset, and found a total of 90,801
SMS spearphishing messages. We also developed a learning-based
multi-classifier that can accurately classify a spearphishing mes-
sage into nice business categories. Based on the above processing,
we also conducted a comprehensive measurement study of the SMS
spearphishing ecosystem, to recover and characterize the crime
scene of this emerging security threat.
Measurement findings. Our discoveries of measurement are
multi-faceted, and we highlight a few major findings here. First,
as the realistic impact, our measurement results show that at least
24,346 victims were suffered from SMS spearphishing attacks dur-
ing the three-month data collection period. In addition to the Names
of victims, we found four other types of personal information, in-
cluding “Flight Info”, “License Plate”, “Bank Card” and “ID Number”
was also leaked and exploited to construct spearphishing messages.
At a macro-level, SMS spearphishing attacks behave unique fea-
tures compared to spamming activities in other fields. Driven by
profit, “Financial Scam” (40.86%) was the most active business in
SMS spearphishing. We also observed two emerging categories
of messages, “Lawsuit Scam” (27.11%) and “Fortune-telling Scam”
(14.43%), which are novel businesses that have never been discussed
in existing spamming analysis work. Furthermore, the working
hours of attackers differ across various categories, e.g., Financial
Scams tend to be active during weekdays and working hours, while
Fortune-telling Scams mainly occur at night. Besides, for the in-
frastructures of this attack, we find that several well-known SMS
gateways are extensively abused for distributing spearphishing
messages due to their low cost and ease-of-use natures.
At the micro-level, we further explore the behaviors and strate-
gies of attackers by grouping spearphishing messages into 11,475
campaigns. Based on the campaign-level analysis, we find several
specific spearphishing businesses exhibit oligopolistic character-
istics, i.e., a few campaigns dominate the major market share. We
also discover that, to evade the detection and increase the prob-
ability of success, four strategies of spearphishing attackers are
developed, including: (1) test-sending; (2) progressive deception;
(3) multi-semantic evasion; and (4) global affair integration. Our
research is the first to reveal the above strategies, which could help
the community to better understand the SMS spearphishing attacks
and provide assistance in the mitigation.
Overall, our research not only spotlights the emerging security
threats to SMS spearphishing attacks, but also provides in-depth
insights to help understand and mitigate the threat.
2 BACKGROUND
Spam SMS typically refers to unwanted or unsolicited messages
received by mobile phone users via Short Messaging Service (SMS).
Previous researches demonstrated that, Spam SMS could be gener-
ated through various channels, including fake base stations [33, 47,
73] or SMS Gateways [48, 49], and are primarily associated with
illegal promotion or malware distribution [14, 22, 40, 70].
Although several works have been devoted to detecting and an-
alyzing the spam SMS ecosystem [36, 48, 49, 73], adversaries are
also constantly evolving and new threats are emerging in this field.
This study focuses on one of the most insidious threats, SMS-based
spearphishing attacks. The adversary crafts specifically targeted
short messages with fraudulent content to trick the victim into
performing a dangerous action. This selective targeting and moti-
vation differentiate SMS spearphishing attacks (our research) from
common Spam SMS, which is generally sent in an undifferentiated
bulk manner. One may also refer this attack to spearphishing in
emails, while it is worth noting one fundamental difference be-
tween them: the preparatory information required for attackers to
construct targeted fraudulent content. Specifically, an email address
naturally implies some information of a “username”, which could
be used directly to construct deceptive content (e.g., a fraudulent

Therefore, we chose to “obtain a sound dataset” rather than
“design a perfect detector”. As the message content of spearphish-
ing SMS is fraudulent, which also falls into the general scope of
spam SMS, we decided to work with a mobile security vendor. The
security application of this vendor has deployed the spam SMS
detection module on mobile clients and accumulated a real-world
spam SMS dataset with well scale and coverage. We then collect
the research dataset by further detecting spearphishing out of the
already discovered spam pool. We acknowledge that, the attacks
we identified may be limited by the view scope of the security ap-
plication. However, it is a practical solution to balance ethics and
usability, which is adequate to give a first glimpse of the spearphish-
ing SMS ecosystem. Considering currently known spearphishing
SMS are basically user-reported cases, our automated approach will
serve as a valuable improvement. Besides, the findings of this work
are also expected to help design a more integrated detection system
in the future.
3 DATASETS
In collaboration with 360 Mobile Safe [1], we performed a data-
driven study to explore spearphishing attacks through SMS. In this
section, we will elaborate on the details and ethical considerations
of data collection.
3.1 Data Collection Process
360 Mobile Safe is a mobile security application in China. It is
available for all versions of the Android platform, and mainly serves
Chinese users [41]. Currently, it is promoting on most popular app
stores, but not on Google Play as Google is blocked in China.
To prevent end-users from being harassed by spamming, 360
Mobile Safe provides the functionality to detect and filter spam
messages. More specifically, once a message is received, it extracts
the message content and sender information, and then a local SVM
classifier and an online deep learning system work together to
identify spam behaviors based on the information collected. If a
message is detected as spam, it would be transferred into Spam
Inbox, and the user will receive a pop-up notification. It should be
