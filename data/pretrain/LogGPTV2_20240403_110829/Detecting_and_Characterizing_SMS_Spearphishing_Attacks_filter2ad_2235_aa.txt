## Abstract
Spearphishing remains a significant and evolving security threat, with new forms continually emerging. Recently, Short Message Service (SMS) has emerged as a new distribution channel for spearphishing, causing substantial real-world impact. Despite this, it has not received adequate attention from the academic community. This paper presents the first systematic study on SMS spearphishing attacks. By collaborating with a leading security vendor, we analyzed 31.96 million real-world spam messages over three months. We developed a novel NLP-based detection algorithm, identifying 90,801 spearphishing messages. A large-scale measurement study was conducted to understand the characteristics of these attacks. Our findings reveal that SMS spearphishing has a significant negative impact, affecting a large number of victims. The distribution of illicit activities in spearphishing messages differs significantly from common spam. At the micro-level, adversaries have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade detection and increase success rates. Our research highlights the urgent need for collaborative efforts to mitigate this emerging threat.

## 1 Introduction
Spearphishing is a form of social engineering attack that targets specific individuals or organizations with tailored, fraudulent messages. To enhance their success, attackers gather and exploit personal information to create convincing and deceptive content. Unlike bulk spam, spearphishing attacks are more likely to deceive victims due to their personalized nature. Over the past decade, spearphishing has become one of the most serious security threats, resulting in significant financial losses and even political interference. Various communication channels, including email, telephony, and social media, have been exploited for spearphishing. Recently, SMS has also been used to distribute spearphishing attacks, causing substantial financial losses and posing a new security threat. Adversaries embed personal information into SMS messages to attract victims' attention and lure them into clicking malicious links or calling fraudulent numbers. Despite its widespread use, SMS spearphishing has not received sufficient attention from the security community, and our understanding of it remains limited.

### Prior Work
Previous research has identified key features of spearphishing, such as automated account registration and sender spoofing. However, the format of SMS is less rich than other channels, making complex clustering and NLP analysis challenging. Existing methods for detecting SMS spam focus on template-based clustering, topic analysis, and sending behaviors, but they cannot distinguish high-risk spearphishing attacks from common spam. Therefore, detecting and characterizing SMS spearphishing is a non-trivial task.

### Research Questions
This paper aims to answer several critical questions about SMS spearphishing:
- What are the characteristics of SMS spearphishing attacks?
- How many end-users are affected by spearphishing SMS?
- Have adversary campaigns evolved into sophisticated strategies?
- How can we mitigate this emerging threat?

### Our Study
To conduct this study, we collaborated with 360 Mobile Safe, a leading security application with millions of monthly active users in China. The application collects spam message logs, and we obtained 31.96 million fraudulent spam messages over three months. We manually identified 1,196 spearphishing messages from a random sample of 50,000 messages, assisted by senior security experts. Based on this dataset, we developed an NLP-based detection system with 96.16% precision. We then applied this system to the entire dataset, identifying 90,801 spearphishing messages. Additionally, we developed a multi-classifier to categorize spearphishing messages into nine business categories. We conducted a comprehensive measurement study to characterize the SMS spearphishing ecosystem.

### Measurement Findings
Our findings are multifaceted:
- **Realistic Impact:** At least 24,346 victims were affected by SMS spearphishing during the data collection period. Personal information, including flight info, license plates, bank cards, and ID numbers, was exploited.
- **Macro-Level Characteristics:** Financial scams (40.86%) were the most active category, followed by lawsuit scams (27.11%) and fortune-telling scams (14.43%). Attackers' activity patterns varied, with financial scams occurring during weekdays and working hours, and fortune-telling scams at night.
- **Micro-Level Strategies:** We grouped spearphishing messages into 11,475 campaigns and found oligopolistic characteristics in specific businesses. Adversaries employed four strategies to evade detection and increase success: test-sending, progressive deception, multi-semantic evasion, and global affair integration.

Overall, our research not only highlights the emerging threat of SMS spearphishing but also provides in-depth insights to help understand and mitigate the threat.

## 2 Background
Spam SMS refers to unwanted or unsolicited messages received via Short Messaging Service (SMS). Previous research has shown that spam SMS can be generated through various channels, including fake base stations and SMS gateways, and is often associated with illegal promotion or malware distribution. While several studies have focused on detecting and analyzing the spam SMS ecosystem, adversaries are constantly evolving, and new threats are emerging. This study focuses on SMS-based spearphishing, where adversaries craft targeted short messages with fraudulent content to trick victims into performing dangerous actions. This selective targeting differentiates SMS spearphishing from common spam SMS, which is sent in bulk. Email spearphishing requires preparatory information, such as usernames, to construct deceptive content, whereas SMS spearphishing leverages a variety of personal information.

### Data Collection
To obtain a robust dataset, we collaborated with 360 Mobile Safe, a mobile security application in China. The application detects and filters spam messages using a local SVM classifier and an online deep learning system. If a message is detected as spam, it is moved to the Spam Inbox, and the user receives a notification. This approach allowed us to collect a large, real-world dataset of spam messages, from which we identified spearphishing messages. This method balances ethical considerations and usability, providing a valuable initial view of the SMS spearphishing ecosystem.

## 3 Datasets
In collaboration with 360 Mobile Safe, we conducted a data-driven study to explore SMS spearphishing. This section details the data collection process and ethical considerations.

### 3.1 Data Collection Process
360 Mobile Safe is a mobile security application available for all Android versions, primarily serving Chinese users. It is promoted on popular app stores but not on Google Play, as Google is blocked in China. The application prevents users from being harassed by spam by detecting and filtering messages. When a message is received, the content and sender information are extracted, and a local SVM classifier and an online deep learning system identify spam. Detected spam messages are moved to the Spam Inbox, and the user is notified. This process allowed us to collect a large, real-world dataset of spam messages, from which we identified spearphishing messages.
