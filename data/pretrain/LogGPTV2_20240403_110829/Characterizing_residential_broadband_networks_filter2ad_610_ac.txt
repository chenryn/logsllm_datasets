### Downstream Link Bandwidths for DSL and Cable ISPs

For various DSL and cable Internet Service Providers (ISPs), the distributions of downstream link bandwidths often exhibit sharp jumps at specific levels, such as 256 Kbps, 384 Kbps, 512 Kbps, and 1 Mbps. Only two cable ISPs, Rogers in Canada and Comcast in the United States, allocate bandwidths across a continuous spectrum.

**Figure 5: Ratio of Downstream to Upstream Link Bandwidths**
- The gap between downstream and upstream bandwidths is significantly wider for cable networks compared to DSL networks.
- **Stable (PacBell DSL host)**
  - Bandwidth remains consistent over time.
- **Unstable (Rogers cable host)**
  - Bandwidth varies greatly over time, fluctuating around an average of 3 Mbps.

**Figure 6: Stable and Unstable Link Bandwidths**
- For the PacBell DSL host, the allocated link bandwidth is stable.
- For the Rogers cable host, the access link bandwidth varies significantly over time.

### Comparison with Advertised Bandwidths

By comparing the measured allocated bandwidths to the advertised speeds from Table 1, we can confirm and quantify some commonly held opinions:
- Most DSL ISPs provide bandwidth rates that match their advertised speeds.
- Major cable ISPs like Comcast and Rogers often show discrepancies (both higher and lower) from their advertised rates.
- This discrepancy is likely due to the nature of the technologies: cable is a shared medium, while DSL is not.
- Many cable ISPs offer significantly higher downstream bandwidths compared to DSL.

**Figure 7: Fraction of Hosts with 'Stable' Downstream Link Bandwidths**
- Most DSL links show stable bandwidths.
- Most cable links do not exhibit stable bandwidths.
- Similar results are observed for upstream bandwidths.

### Stability of Allocated Link Bandwidths

#### Short-Term Stability
- We examined the stability of the allocated link bandwidths over a 10-second duration by dividing the period into 100 ms intervals (typical RTT).
- **Figure 8: Long-Term Link Bandwidth Stability**
  - BT Broadband shows stable bandwidths over time.
  - Rogers exhibits diurnal patterns, with lower bandwidths (almost a 25% reduction) in the evening (4 PM to 7 PM) compared to early morning (1 AM to 5 AM).

#### Long-Term Diurnal Stability
- Measurements were taken every half hour for one week from 70 randomly chosen hosts from each ISP.
- Most ISPs, including BT Broadband, show high long-term stability.
- A few ISPs, like Rogers, display clear diurnal trends in link bandwidths.

### Traffic Shaping

Traffic shaping is a factor contributing to bandwidth instability in broadband networks. Some ISPs allow an initial burst of bandwidth, which can be many times greater than the advertised rate. For example, Comcastâ€™s PowerBoost feature doubles the customer's allocated bandwidth for a short time, reducing download times for small files.

**Figure 9: Traffic-Shaped Downstream**
- An example link from Ameritech DSL shows a bandwidth drop from 2.5 Mbps to 1.5 Mbps after the first second.

We found similar traffic-shaping techniques used by three ISPs:
- 11% of Ameritech links
- 26% of Comcast links
- 67% of Chello links

These bursts typically exceed the long-term bandwidth by more than 1 Mbps. However, precise quantification was challenging due to the high burst rates.

### Packet Latencies

We analyzed the three components of packet latencies: propagation delays, transmission delays, and queuing delays.

#### Propagation Delays
- Propagation delay is the time elapsed between sending a bit at one end and receiving it at the other.
- Broadband propagation delays could be short due to the short physical links, but sophisticated signal processing and error correction algorithms might increase these delays.
- Our methodology estimates the round-trip delay of the last-hop path between our measurement hosts and the broadband hosts, approximating the sum of downstream and upstream propagation delays.

- **Cable Jitter and Last Hop**
- Latency distributions for both DSL and cable links, showing the variability in propagation delays.

### Conclusion

Our analysis provides insights into the stability and characteristics of broadband link bandwidths and latencies. While DSL links generally show stable and predictable behavior, cable links exhibit significant variability, posing challenges for transport protocol designers. Additionally, traffic shaping practices by some ISPs further complicate the prediction of future bandwidth conditions.
