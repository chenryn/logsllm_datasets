may be relevant at a later point in the penetration exercise. Clients will also want
to know how specific data was obtained, and ask for references to resources.
Examples are what tools were used to obtain the data or what publicfacing
resources; for example, the specific search query in Google that was submitted to
obtain the data. Informing a customer "you obtained the goal" isn't good enough,
because the purpose of a Penetration Test is to identify weakness for future repairs.

Reconnaissance objectives
• Target background: What is the focus of the target's business?
• Target's associates: Who are the business partners, vendors, and customers?
• Target's investment in security: Are security policies advertised? What is
the potential investment security, and user security awareness?
• Target's business and security policies: How does the business operate?
Where are the potential weaknesses in operation?
• Target's people: What type of people work there? How can they become
your asset for the attack?
• Define targets: What are the lowest hanging fruit targets? What should
be avoided?
• Target's network: How do the people and devices communicate on
the network?
• Target's defenses: What type of security is in place? Where is it located?
• Target's technologies: What technologies are used for e-mail, network
traffic, storing information, authentication, and so on? Are they vulnerable?
Kali Linux contains an extensive catalog of tools titled Information Gathering
specified for Reconnaissance efforts. It could fill a separate book to cover all tools
and methods offered for Information Gathering. This chapter will focus on various
web application Reconnaissance topics and relate the best tools found on the
Internet as well as that offered by Kali Linux.
Initial research
Reconnaissance should begin with learning as much as possible about people and
business associated with the target. Sun Tzu is credited with the phrase, "know your
enemy" in the book, The Art of War. As a Penetration Tester, you need to know your
target. If your target happens to be a website, you should look at all aspects of that
website. It will give you a better understanding of how the site is maintained and
run. Great Reconnaissance returns more possible vulnerabilities.
It is scary how much information is available on public sources. We have found
the unimaginable, such as classified documents, passwords, vulnerability reports,
undesirable photography, and access to security cameras. Many Penetration Testing
project objectives start with leveraging information off public sources. Here are some
starting points for gathering information from public sources.

Chapter 2
Company website
There is a lot of valuable information that can be obtained from a target's website.
Most corporate websites list their executive team, public figures, and members from
recruiting and human resource contacts. These can become targets for other search
efforts and social engineering attacks.
More valuable information can be obtained by looking at what other companies
are listed as partners, current job postings, business information, and security
policies. Reconnaissance on a high-valued partner can be as important as the
primary target, because partners may provide a new source for obtaining
intelligence. An example is compromising a contracted resource that manages
the helpdesk at a target's headquarters.
The Robots.txt file is publicly available and found on websites that gives
instructions to web robots (also known as search engine spiders), about what
is and not visible using the Robots Exclusion Protocol. The Disallow: / statement
tells a browser not to visit a source; however, a Disallow can be ignored by giving
a researcher intelligence on what a target hopes to not disclose to the public.
To view the Robots.txt file, find the Robots.txt file in the root directory of a target
website. For example, adding the Robots.txt file to Facebook would look as shown
in the following screenshot:

Reconnaissance
Web history sources
There are archived versions of most public websites available on sources such as the
WayBack Machine at archive.org. Interesting information can be found in an older
version of a target's website, such as outdated organizational charts, phone numbers,
customer intelligence, systems information listed in fields, such as view source or
/robots.txt, older business partnerships, vulnerabilities fixed in later versions,
and other useful data, the target doesn't want on the current website version. It is
important to understand that the publicly available information is hard to remove
completely, making historical sources a valuable place for Reconnaissance research.
To access the WayBack Machine, open up the web browser and navigate to
http://archive.org, you will see the Internet Archive WayBack Machine
in the middle of the page, as shown in the following screenshot:

As a Penetration Tester, this is a valuable tool, because it doesn't leave evidence of
Reconnaissance on your target. In fact, your target is never even touched using this
tool. All the information has been archived online in the Wayback Machine. The

Regional Internet Registries (RIRs)
RIR is an organization that manages the allocation and registration of IP resources
within a particular region of the world. There are five major RIRs: the USA, Canada,
and parts of the Caribbean region can be found at www.arin.net. You can gather
information on a target such as Lancope, as seen in the following screenshot:

Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval (EDGAR)
The EDGAR database contains registration statements, periodic reports, and other
forms of information on companies since 1994. Companies in the United States of
America are required by law to file, and all information is publicly available. The
following two screenshots show public documents found while searching Lancope:

Chapter 2
Social media resources
Social media is everywhere, and in most cases, publicly accessible. Most people have
a Facebook, LinkedIn, blogs, or other forms of cloud accounts containing valuable
information. This information can be used as a means of social engineering intelligence
from a target's current or previous staff. An example is searching Glassdoor.com to
identify previous employees that are disgruntled, based on feedback.
There are many people finding web resources such as Maltego (found in Kali Linux)
that can comb popular social media, public records, and job recruiting websites to
fingerprint an individual based on limited information, such as a first and last name.
A researcher could gather information such as everywhere an individual has lived,
done business, people with which they socialize, special interests, favorite sport
teams, and other useful data for future research and social engineering attacks.
Trust
Most people are naturally trusting and assume information posted on public sources is
real. To test this concept, the writers of this book created a fake person through social
media and pretended to be a new hire for a target company. The fake person would
become friends with associates of our target, post fake holiday cards that are linked
to a BeEF system designed to compromise vulnerable Internet browsers (using BeEF
is covered later in this book), and captured sensitive information from compromised
systems. We were able to map out the entire organization, obtain network information,
and even had hardware shipped to us without an internal e-mail or phone number.
Our fake person, Emily Williams isn't real, yet received job offers, was provided inside
information, and access to events hosted by the target. Information is power, and
people will give it to a requester who seems like they can be trusted.
More information on this project can be found at:
http://www.thesecurityblogger.com/?p=1903
Job postings
Job postings contain a wealth of knowledge about a target's environment. Job listings
can provide details on what type of systems are installed, who manages them, how
large the staff is, and the staff's skill level. Human Resource representatives are
typically eager to share information with a potential new hire, which can be used as
an avenue to inside information. An example is targeting a job posting for a Oracle
developer to understand the hardware, version of Oracle, names of existing and
previous administrators, existing operation issues, security gaps, and methods to
access such as asking "can administrators work from home, and how do they access
the systems?"
[ 41 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
Another avenue to review is a job's expected salary, benefits, and turnover rate on
popular job boards. These trends may uncover new vectors for attack. Glassdoor.
com is an example of a popular source for this type of data.
Location
The investment in cyber security for a target can typically be determined based on
the level of physical security. One would assume a building with fences and armed
guards would have a higher investment in cyber security than a target located within
a public building. Online mapping sources such as Google maps can help identify
where physical security is implemented, and trends on how people move to and
from the target. Other areas of interest are identifying where a Penetration Tester
could camp out to scan for wireless networks, and possible methods to bypass
access controls, such as attire and badges used to obtain physical access.
Shodan
Shodan is a search engine that can identify a specific device, such as computer,
router, server, using a variety of filters, such as metadata from system banners.
For example, you can search for a specific system, such as a Cisco 3850, running
a version of software such as IOS Version 15.0(1)EX.
[ 42 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
The following example is a use case searching for any SCADA system with public
Internet access, which in theory isn't supposed to exist however, Shodan can show
this is not necessarily true. SCADA systems control things like power management
and water treatment, so identifying public accessible systems is extremely bad!

Google hacking
Google hacking is the most common form of search engine Reconnaissance of web
applications. Google hacking uses advanced operations in the Google search engine
to locate specific strings of text within search results. Search filters can zero in on
specific versions of vulnerable web applications such as Powered by Apache in the
intitle:"index of" operator or identify log files such as ws_ftp.log, containing
sensitive IP information. The following few screenshots demonstrate using a Google
search for Linksys to find publicly available Linksys cameras. The first screenshot
shows the search command followed by some example results from issuing the search.
The last screenshot shows a camera feed that could be found using this technique.
[ 44 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
Some example search queries are as follows:
• Identifies sensitive documents: intext: classified top secret
• Identifies Linksys Camera Management GUIs (caution: you may not like
what you find): inurl:main.cgi
• Identifies Nessus reports to find vulnerable systems: inurl:NESSUSXXXXXXXX
For more information on Google hacking, check out a very good book titled Google
Hacking for Penetration Testers by Johnny Long, as well as his website at http://

Google Hacking Database
The Google Hacking Database (GHDB) created by Johnny Long of Hackers For
Charity (http://www.hackersforcharity.org/), is the definitive source for Google
search queries. Searches for usernames, passwords, vulnerable systems, and exploits
have been captured and categorized by Google hacking aficionados. The aficionados
who have categorized the Google searches are affectingly known as Google dorks.

Reconnaissance
To access the GHDB, navigate to http://www.exploit-db.com/google-dorks/.
You will see the latest GHDB searches listed on the web page. You can click on any
of the search queries yourself.
You will find different categories of searches at the bottom of the page that have
been saved. In the following example, we scroll to the category Vulnerable Files
and select the query ionCube Loader Wizard.

Chapter 2
We can select the search query, and it will bring us to Google, performing the
same search query.
[ 47 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
The preceding example shows Google has found a few results. The ionCube Loader
is apparently not configured or misconfigured. The ionCube Loader is actually a
great piece of software that protects software written in PHP from being viewed or
changed from unlicensed computers. However, in this case, administrators left the
default wizard running without any configuration.
When we click on the first link, we get the home screen to configure the software.
The GHDB essentially turns Google into a limited web application scanner for a
Penetration Tester. In this case, good software that can increase security can now
potentially be used against a web server by an attacker.
Researching networks
Many people do not understand the true purpose of researching the network of a
target prior to launching an attack. Amateur Penetration Testers understand the need
to pick a target before they can perform a Penetration Test. After all, a Penetration
Tester needs someplace at which to point their arsenal of tools. Many amateurs will
run Nmap, ping sweeps, or other noisy tools to determine what targets are available
disrupting the environment, which later yields poor results.
Network Reconnaissance is about selecting a target. A seasoned network security
professional will tell you good Reconnaissance is about selecting a quality target,
spending the majority of their time watching, rather than acting. The first step of
every Penetration Test is accurately finding and selecting quality targets.
[ 48 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
From a client's viewpoint, Penetration Testers will encounter individuals
that gain satisfaction in stopping Penetration Testers to prove their value
as employees, as well as how well prepared they are for cyber attacks. It
is highly recommended that a professional Penetration Tester does not
get into a conflict with a client's staff while penetration services are being
performed. A Penetration Tester should focus on security awareness,
and reveal what vulnerabilities exist with the least amount of interaction
with a target's staff during a service engagement.
The following are the best available tools in Kali for web application
Reconnaissance. Other tools may be available for web applications or
different target types however, the focus of this chapter is enabling a
reader for evaluating web application-based targets.
HTTrack – clone a website
HTTrack is a tool built into Kali. The purpose of HTTrack is to copy a website.
It allows a Penetration Tester to look at the entire content of a website, all its pages,
and files offline, and in their own controlled environment. In addition, we will use
HTTrack for social engineering attacks in later chapters. Having a copy of a website
could be used to develop fake phishing websites, which can be incorporated in other
Penetration Testing toolsets.
To use HTTrack, open a Terminal window and type in apt-get install httrack
as shown in the following screenshot.
Some versions of Kali do not have this built-in.
[ 49 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Reconnaissance
You will want to create a directory to store your copied website. The following
screenshot shows a directory created named mywebsites using the mkdir command.
To start HTTrack, type httrack in the command window and give the project
a name, as shown in the following screenshot:
The next step is to select a directory to save the website. The example in the
following screenshot shows the folder created in the previous step /root/
mywebsites, used for the directory:
Enter the URL of the site you want to capture. The example in the following
screenshot shows www.drchaos.com. This can be any website. Most attacks
use a website accessed by clients from your target, such as popular social
media websites or the target's internal websites.
The next two options are presented regarding what you want to do with the
captured site. Option 2 is the easiest method, which is a mirror website with
a wizard as shown in the following screenshot:
[ 50 ]
www.it-ebooks.info
Chapter 2
Next, you can specify if you want to use a proxy to launch the attack. You can also
specify what type of files you want to download (the example in the following
screenshot shows * for all files). You can also define any command line options
or flags you might want to set. The example in the following screenshot shows no
additional options.
Before httrack runs, it will display the command that it is running. You can use this
command in the future if you want to run httrack without going through the wizard
again. The following two screenshots show hhtrack cloning www.drchaos.com:

After you are done cloning the website, navigate to the directory where you
saved it. Inside, you will find all your files and webpages, as shown in the
following screenshot:
You are now ready to research your target's website and possibly build a
customized penetration tool or exploit user access to a cloned website.
ICMP Reconnaissance techniques
The ping and traceroute commands are good ways to find out basic information
about your target. When information travels across networks, it usually does not go
directly from source to destination. It usually traverses through several systems, such
as routers, firewalls, and other computer systems before it gets to its destination.
The traceroute command identifies each system the data travels across, along with
the time it takes for the data to move between systems. The tool is installed in every
modern operating system. For most high-value targets, the ping and traceroute
commands will most likely be disabled, and excessive use of these services will
most likely trigger alerts on network security systems. Many firewalls or other
systems are set up not to respond to number B24RYE routes. If systems do respond
to traceroute, using this too excessively can trigger security events. These tools are
noisy, and when used indiscriminately, they will set off alarms and logs. If your goal
is to be stealthy, you have just been defeated, giving your target an opportunity to
set up and deploy counter measures against your Penetration Test.
An ICMP sweep simply sends out an echo request and looks for a reply. If a reply
is returned, then, as a Penetration Tester, you know there is a possible target. The
problem with ICMP scans is that ICMP is usually blocked by most firewalls. That
means any scans from outside going to an internal target network will be blocked by
an ICMP scanner.
The ping command is the most basic way to start an ICMP sweep. You simply type
