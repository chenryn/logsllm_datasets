User: In virtualization technology, how to implement communication between virtual machines?
Assistant: In virtualization technology, there are two main ways of communication between virtual machines: 1. Virtual network: virtual network is a virtualization technology that allows virtual machines to communicate in a virtual network, just like devices on a physical network Same. The virtual network can be implemented through virtual devices such as virtual switches and virtual routers, and virtual machines can be assigned independent IP addresses in the virtual network and communicate through virtual switches. 2. Shared storage: In the shared storage architecture, multiple virtual machines share a disk space and can communicate through shared file systems (such as NFS, CIFS, etc.). The virtual machine can mount the shared disk to its own file system, and then it can access files in the shared storage just like accessing a local disk. Both of the above two methods can realize communication between virtual machines, and which method to choose depends on the specific scenario.
