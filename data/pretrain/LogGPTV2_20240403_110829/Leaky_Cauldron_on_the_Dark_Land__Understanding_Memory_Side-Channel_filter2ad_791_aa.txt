### Abstract
Recent attention has been drawn to side-channel risks associated with Intel SGX, particularly the newly discovered page-fault attack. This attack involves an OS-level adversary inducing page faults to observe the page-level access patterns of a protected process running in an SGX enclave. While most proposed defenses focus on this specific attack, little is known about their effectiveness against variations or other potential attack vectors. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of memory-related side-channel threats in SGX, identifying eight potential attack vectors ranging from TLB to DRAM modules. We highlight common misunderstandings and demonstrate that high-frequency Asynchronous Enclave Exits (AEXs) can be avoided when recovering EdDSA secret keys through a new page channel. Additionally, fine-grained monitoring of enclave programs (at the 64B level) can be achieved by combining cache and cross-enclave DRAM channels. Our findings reveal the gap between ongoing security research and the actual side-channel weaknesses in SGX, redefining the threat model for secure enclaves and prompting a discussion on the appropriate use and secure implementation of such systems.

### 1. Introduction
Establishing a trusted execution environment (TEE) capable of protecting large-scale, data-intensive computing is a significant security challenge. This is crucial for tasks such as outsourcing the analysis of sensitive data (e.g., electronic health records) to untrusted clouds. Cryptographic methods like fully homomorphic encryption are too slow for practical use, making hardware-based solutions like Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) a promising alternative. SGX provides a secure enclave designed to be resilient to attacks from the host operating system or even system administrators. However, the simplicity of its design means that an enclave program must utilize resources partially or fully controlled by the untrusted OS, potentially exposing it to side-channel attacks.

#### SGX Side-Channel Risks
Recent studies have shown that an adversary with full control over the OS can manipulate the page tables of code running in an SGX-protected mode, inducing page faults and inferring sensitive information. These page-fault side-channel attacks can extract text documents, image outlines, and compromise cryptographic operations. Intel acknowledges that SGX does not defend against several side-channel attack vectors, including power statistics, cache miss statistics, branch timing, and page accesses via page tables. They recommend that software vendors design enclaves to prevent the leakage of side-channel information, though they work with academia and open-source partners to mitigate these threats.

Given the importance of the problem, recent years have seen numerous attempts to address SGX side-channel threats, primarily focusing on the page-fault attack. However, this narrow focus may be inadequate. Memory management, including virtual and physical memory control, is partially or fully exposed to the untrusted OS. A comprehensive understanding of possible attack surfaces is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed protections and to identify more lightweight and effective attack techniques.

### 2. Understanding Memory Side-Channel Attacks
To provide a comprehensive understanding of memory-related side-channel threats, we explore the following areas:

- **Exploration of Memory Side-Channel Attack Surfaces:** We surveyed SGX side-channel attack surfaces involving memory management, identifying eight types of attack vectors related to address translation caches, page tables, and the entire cache and DRAM hierarchy. This study presents the most comprehensive analysis of memory side-channel attack surfaces against SGX enclaves.
- **Reducing Side Effects of Memory Side-Channel Attacks:** We developed a new memory-based attack called Sneaky Page Monitoring (SPM), which demonstrates that a large number of AEXs are not a necessary condition for successful attacks. SPM works by setting and resetting a page's accessed flag in the page table entry (PTE) to monitor when the page is visited, without generating interrupts. We show that this approach can reduce the number of interrupts, making the attack almost invisible to existing interrupt-based defenses.
- **Improving Attack’s Spatial Granularity:** We demonstrate a series of memory side-channel attacks that achieve finer spatial granularity, including a cross-enclave Prime+Probe attack, a cross-enclave DRAMA attack, and a novel cache-DRAM attack. These attacks leverage both Prime+Probe cache attacks and DRAMA attacks to achieve a fine-grained observation (64B), enabling us to monitor the execution flows of an enclave program.

### 3. Implications
Our findings highlight the lack of understanding about potential attack surfaces in SGX, which can have serious consequences. Existing defense mechanisms are vulnerable to the new attacks we developed, and some only marginally increase the cost for attackers. We hope our study will lead to a rethinking of the security limitations of SGX and similar TEE technologies, prompting a discussion on when and how to use them securely.

### 4. Contributions
In this paper, we make the following contributions:
- **In-depth Study on SGX Memory Side-Channel Attack Surfaces:** We reveal new channels that disclose information about the enclave, including accessed flags, timing, and cross-enclave channels.
- **New Attacks:** We developed a suite of new attack techniques that exploit these new channels, demonstrating that multiple channels can complement each other to enhance the effectiveness of an attack.
- **New Understanding:** We discuss possible mitigations of the new threats and emphasize the importance of a better understanding of the limitations of SGX-like technologies.

### 5. Background
#### 5.1 Memory Isolation in Intel SGX
Memory isolation is a key feature of Intel SGX, implemented via extensions to existing processor architectures. Intel SGX reserves a range of continuous physical memory exclusively for enclave programs, called Processor Reserved Memory (PRM). The extended memory management units (MMU) of the CPU prevent access to PRM from all programs outside the enclaves, including the OS kernel, hypervisors, SMM code, or DMA. The Enclave Page Cache (EPC) is a subset of PRM, divided into 4KB pages. Each EPC page can be allocated to one enclave at a time.

The virtual memory space of each program includes an Enclave Linear Address Range (ELRANGE) reserved for enclaves and mapped to EPC pages. Page tables responsible for translating virtual addresses to physical addresses are managed by the untrusted system software. The translation lookaside buffer (TLB) works for EPC pages in traditional ways. When the CPU transitions between non-enclave and enclave modes, TLB entries associated with the current Process-Context Identifier (PCID) and the global identifier are flushed, preventing non-enclave code from learning information about address translation inside the enclaves.
