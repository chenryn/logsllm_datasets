#### 2.6 Training

**Concept**
The purpose of training is to equip end users with the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to successfully transition to a new environment. Training activities begin in the Planning Process Phase with a high-level training method and approach, documented in an initial draft of the Training Plan, Section 2: Approach. In the Executing Process Phase, end user training is planned, developed, and delivered. Figure 2-11 illustrates the goals of the Training Knowledge Area throughout the Project Management Lifecycle (PMLC).

**Figure 2-12: Inputs, Roles, Skills, Activities, Tools, and Outputs for Training in the Executing Process Phase**

| **Inputs** | **Roles** | **Skills** | **Outputs** |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| - Training Method and Approach<br> - Project Schedule | - Training Lead<br> - OCM Practitioner<br> - Project Manager<br> - Project Sponsor<br> - Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) | - Facilitation<br> - Planning<br> - Analysis<br> - Project Management | - Completed Training Plan<br> - Training Curriculum<br> - Training Materials<br> - Completed Training Action Log |

**Activities** | **Tools**
|--------------|----------|
| - Plan for Training<br> - Develop Training<br> - Conduct Training | - Training Plan Template<br> - Training Action Log Template |

### 2.6.1 Inputs
To complete the Training activities within the Executing Process Phase, the training resources and the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding of the following inputs:

- **Training Method and Approach**: During the Planning Process Phase, the OCM Practitioner, in collaboration with the Project Manager, project team, and other training resources, identifies the anticipated training method and approach in Section 2: Approach of the draft Training Plan. The training method and approach define the overall strategy for training delivery and the methods used to implement that strategy. For example, an organization may use the Train-the-Trainer approach and instructor-led training to complete end-user training.
- **Project Schedule**: The project schedule, included in the Project Management Plan (PMP), provides insight into overall project activities and timing.

### 2.6.2 Roles
The following table lists the roles and their associated responsibilities for those involved in OCM Training activities during the Executing Process Phase:

| **Role** | **Responsibilities** |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Training Lead** | - Assess training needs<br> - Develop Training Plan<br> - Develop Training curriculum<br> - Develop Training materials<br> - Conduct end-user training |
| **OCM Practitioner** | - Support the Training Lead in executing all training knowledge area activities |
| **Project Manager** | - Assist the OCM Practitioner in identifying training needs |
| **Project Sponsor** | - Assist the OCM Practitioner in identifying training needs |
| **SMEs** | - Assist in the development of course materials |

*Note: The execution of training should be tailored to meet the needs of the system users. Training efforts can range from simple courses to complex curriculums. As such, the training responsibilities may be covered by the same resource serving as the OCM Practitioner, or the project may designate a Training Lead or other training resources as needed. This section prescribes the activities for the Training Lead, though it may be the OCM Practitioner or another training resource performing the work.*

### 2.6.3 Activities
End-user training is crucial for the success of an implementation, as it prepares users to adopt the new system. To maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the training effort, this knowledge area includes three activities in the Executing Process Phase:

- **Plan for Training**
- **Develop Training**
- **Conduct Training**

**Plan for Training**
- **Identify Training Needs**: The Training Lead should first assess the organizationâ€™s training needs to tailor the Training Plan accordingly. This involves understanding and defining the purpose, scope, and desired outcomes of the training effort. Key questions include:
  - Who are the end users?
  - What roles will end users have in the new system?
  - What KSAs will each role need to function with the new system?

- **Complete the Training Plan**: The Training Lead uses the identified training needs to complete the Training Plan. This plan provides strategies for planning, developing, delivering, and evaluating the training. The Training Plan consists of several sections, including:
  - **Introduction and Approach**: Highlights the purpose and objectives of the Training Plan, the methodology behind the plan, and the intended use.
  - **Roles and Responsibilities**: Describes the roles, resources, and responsibilities specific to the training effort.
  - **Training Activities**: Divides training activities into planning, developing, delivering, and evaluating, detailing the proposed schedule, needs, and strategies for each phase.

- **Other Planning Tasks**:
  - **Identify SMEs**: SMEs provide critical business and/or system knowledge, enriching the training with real-world situations and examples. They can also serve as trainers or coaches.
  - **Evaluate LMS Needs**: Determine if a Learning Management System (LMS) is required based on the size, scope, and number of training participants.
  - **Identify and Prepare Trainers**: Ensure trainers are prepared, provided with training materials, and informed of the training schedule.
  - **Identify and Evaluate Training Facilities**: Ensure the training environment is conducive to an educational setting, with appropriate technical infrastructure and comfortable conditions.
  - **Determine Training Delivery Schedule**: Position training close to go-live to increase retention.
  - **Manage Learner Registration and Attendance**: If an LMS is not required, identify a mechanism for tracking registration and attendance.

**Develop Training**
- **Develop Training Curriculum**: The training curriculum serves as a high-level overview of the planned training, providing a roadmap for material development and delivery. It includes:
  - **Course Map**: Defines the courses to be offered, often categorized based on content and participant needs.
  - **Course Objectives**: Specific and measurable objectives that take into account the KSA needs of course participants.
  - **Delivery Method**: Choose from various methods, such as instructor-led training, web-based live or recorded training, and eLearning self-studies.
  - **Training Support Materials**: Include slide decks, presentations, videos, handouts, job aids, and learner manuals.

- **Develop Training Materials**: The Training Lead, with support from SMEs and the project team, develops training materials based on the strategies identified in the Training Plan. Common materials include:
  - Student Workbook
  - Practice Exercises
  - Handouts
  - Slide Deck
  - Instructor Guides
  - Quick Help Guides
  - Videos
  - eLearning Courses

- **Implement Quality Assurance and Testing Measures**: Ensure training materials are relevant, accurate, and well-presented. This includes:
  - Reviews by resources separate from the training development team.
  - Mock training exercises with a sample population of end users.
  - Use training materials to educate User Acceptance Testers (UATs).

**Conduct Training**
- **Coordinate Training Delivery**: Ensure training aligns with the Project Schedule. Consider general principles for educating adults, as outlined by Malcolm Knowles' Adult Learning Methodology:
  1. Explain the reasons why specific topics are being taught.
  2. Focus instruction on tasks rather than memorization.
  3. Consider and apply the backgrounds of learners in training opportunities.
  4. Adults are self-directed but still require guidance and help when mistakes are made.

- **Record Training Actions**: Use the Training Action Log to track all actions associated with the end-user training effort.

1. OCM Lifecycle Management
2. Communication
3. Leadership Support
4. Team Dynamics
5. Stakeholder Enrollment
6. Training

This checklist ensures that all necessary steps are taken to consider the Executing Process Phase complete.
