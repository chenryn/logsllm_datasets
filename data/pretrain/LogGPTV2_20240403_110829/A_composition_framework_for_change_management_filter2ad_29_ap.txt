The purpose of training is to provide end users with the knowledge, skills, and  
abilities (KSAs) they need to transition and be successful in a new environment.  
Training  activities  began  in  the  Planning  Process  Phase  with  a  high-level  
training  method  and  approach,  documented  in  an  initial  draf  of  the  Training  
Plan, Section 2: Approach. In the Executing Process Phase, end user training is  
planned, developed, and delivered. Figure 2-11 provides the goals of the Training  
Knowledge Area throughout the PMLC.

2.6.1 Inputs 
To  complete  the  Training  activities  within  the  Executing  Process  Phase,  the  
training resources and the OCM Practitioner will need a thorough understanding  
of the following inputs. 
Training Method and Approach: During the Planning Process Phase, the OCM  
Practitioner worked with the Project Manager, the project team, and any other  
training  resources,  in  order  to  identify  the  anticipated  training  method  and  
approach in Section 2: Approach of the draf Training Plan. The training method  
and approach define the overall approach to training delivery and the methods  
used to implement that approach. For example, an organization may utilize the  
Train-the-Trainer approach and the instructor-led training method to complete  
end user training. 
Project Schedule: The project schedule, included in the PMP, provides insight  
into overall project activities and timing.

2.6.3 Activities 
End user training is an integral part of success of an implementation because 
it allows the users to be better prepared to adopt the new system. In order to 
maximize the eficiency and efectiveness of the training efort, this knowledge 
area has three activities in this process phase: 
•  Plan for training 
•  Develop training 
•  Conduct training 
Plan for Training 
In order to guide the training efort, the Training Lead should develop a robust 
Training Plan. The plan was initially started in the Planning Process Phase with 
the completion of the draf Training Plan, Section 2: Approach. In the Executing 
Process Phase, the plan should be completed to elaborate with the details to 
plan, develop, deliver, and evaluate end user training. The Training Plan serves 
as a guide for the Training Lead in completing the end-user training efort. 
Identify Training Needs 
The Training Lead should first assess the organization’s training needs in order 
to tailor the Training Plan accordingly. This encompasses understanding and 
defining the purpose, scope, and desired outcomes of the training efort. 
The Training Lead identifies an organization’s training needs by answering the 
following questions: 
•  Who are the end users? 
•  What are the roles end users will have in the new system? 
•  What knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) will each role need to possess 
to function with the new system? 
The Training Lead answers the above questions, with the help of the project 
team, in order to identify the needs that will guide the direction, scope, and 
desired outcomes of the training efort.

Complete the Training Plan 
The Training Lead uses the training needs as inputs for completing the Training 
Plan.  This  plan  provides  strategies  for  planning,  developing,  delivering,  and 
evaluating  the  training.  The  Training  Plan  consists  of  several  sections,  all 
adaptable for specific projects. 
•  Introduction and Approach: These sections highlight the purpose and 
objectives of the Training Plan, the methodology behind the plan, and the 
intended use. 
•  Roles and Responsibilities: The Roles and Responsibilities section 
describes, in detail, the roles, resources, and responsibilities specific to the 
training efort. The size of the training team will vary depending on the size 
and complexity of the change and supporting training need. The roles may 
be filled by teams of individuals when the training program encompasses 
large, complex needs. 
•  Training Activities: Training activities are divided into planning, developing,  
delivering, and evaluating. Each subsection details the proposed schedule,  
needs, and strategies for each phase of the training efort. 
Other Planning Tasks 
In addition to a detailed Training Plan, the training efort requires additional 
planning and preparation. This efort includes: 
•  Identifying Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to assist in development. 
SMEs provide critical business and/or system knowledge, which enriches 
the training with real-world situations and examples. Additionally, SMEs 
can serve as trainers or coaches that support the training efort. 
•  Evaluate if a Learning Management System (LMS) is needed to support 
the training efort. The LMS is a training repository that can have one 
or multiple of the following key features: storing materials, warehousing 
computer-based training courses, and/or managing training support 
elements (such as enrollment, attendance, evaluations).  The Training 
Lead should determine if an LMS is required based on the size, scope, and 
number of training participants. 
•  Identifying and preparing trainers. Training resources need to be 
identified early on to ensure they are prepared, to provide them with the 
training materials, and to communicate the training schedule.

•  Identifying and evaluating training facilities. The training environment 
plays an important role in training delivery. Facilities must be conducive 
to an educational environment, with appropriate technical infrastructure 
and comfortable conditions. The Training Lead should consider cost, 
geography, and available amenities. 
•  Determining training delivery schedule. Training should be conducted 
“just in time.” Just in time is a training industry best practice that 
positions the training that people receive as close to go-live as possible. 
This increases training retention. The OCM Practitioner should utilize the 
Project Schedule to determine the most suitable training timeline. 
•  Managing learner registration and attendance. If the Training Lead 
determines an LMS is not required for the training efort, he/she should 
identify a mechanism for tracking registration and attendance. 
Develop Training 
The goal of end user training is to develop and deliver a training program that 
meets  the  organization’s  training  needs.  The  Training  Lead  will  utilize  the 
Training  Plan  to  guide  training  development  activities,  including  developing 
the  training  curriculum,  creating  training  materials,  and  completing  quality 
assurance and pilot testing processes. 
Develop Training Curriculum 
Training curriculum serves as a high level overview of the planned training. It 
provides a road map for the material development process and the delivery 
efort. Training curriculum identifies: 
•  Course map: The course map defines what courses will be ofered. It ofen 
categorizes courses based on content and participant needs. 
•  Course objectives: Course objectives define what participants will be 
able to do at the end of the course. Objectives should be specific and 
measurable, taking into account the KSA needs of course participants.

•  Delivery method: There are many delivery methods to choose from, 
including instructor-led training, web-based live or recorded training, and 
eLearning self-studies. For more information on delivery methods, review 
the Training section of the Planning Process Phase chapter. The Training 
Lead should consider the course objectives, number of participants, and 
current KSAs of the training participants in determining the most suitable 
delivery method for each course. 
•  Training support materials: Support materials may include, but are not 
limited to, slide decks, web-based live or recorded presentations, videos, 
handouts, job aids, and learner manuals. Training materials should be 
suficient to support the course objectives. 
The Training Lead should plan and establish a solid curriculum that addresses 
training  needs,  adheres  to  the  strategies  set  forth  in  the  Training  Plan,  and 
provides users with the knowledge, skills, and abilities that they will need in 
the  future  state.  Afer  the  curriculum  is  developed  and  approved  based  on 
the process set forth in the Training Plan, the Training Lead begins developing 
training materials. 
Develop Training Materials 
The  Training  Lead,  with  support  from  SMEs  and  the  project  team,  should 
develop  training  materials  based  on  the  strategies  identified  in  the  Training 
Plan. The table below provides example materials commonly used in training. 
Example Training Materials 
•  Student Workbook 
•  Practice Exercises 
•  Hand Outs 
•  Slide Deck 
•  Instructor Guides 
•  Quick Help Guides

Training 
The Training Lead should leverage future business models, human interactions 
with the solution, use case scenarios, and testing environment of the solution in 
order to incorporate training and exercises that mimic real business situations. 
When developing training materials, the Training Lead should include: 
•  Real world situations: Participants need to practice KSAs using 
conditions that are similar to those they will encounter with the new 
system. Real world situations provide a transfer of knowledge that will 
help participants to retain KSAs through go-live. 
•  Connections to participants’ prior knowledge: Participants will be 
more apt to connect with training and retain content if it is built on a 
familiar foundation. Whenever possible, the Training Lead should make 
connections to participants’ prior knowledge. 
•  Opportunities for practice and repetition: Participants need multiple 
opportunities for hands on practice in order to increase participation 
and boost retention rates. Such opportunities may include exercises, 
simulations, and problem solving. 
In  addition,  the  Training  Lead  should  consider  the  following  best  practice 
methods when developing training materials: 
•  Keep training materials selective. Ofentimes, developers and 
instructors alike try to provide too much information in too limited a 
time span. Participants need time and practice to learn. As such, the OCM 
Practitioner should focus eforts on the most important concepts, allowing 
ample opportunities for activities and experiences that reinforce these 
concepts. 
•  Balance training to focus on afective, behavioral, and cognitive 
learning. Sometimes, training focuses on just one area; however, balanced 
training will allow participants to foster appropriate attitudes, develop 
and practice skills, and understand the concepts behind the objectives. 
•  Ensure developers and instructors have opportunities for continuing 
education. Developers and instructors need to stay informed on the 
training industry as it continues to change and evolve. This commitment 
to learning will allow developers and instructors to incorporate industry 
best practices and ideas in order to create a dynamic, up to date training 
experience for all participants.

Training 
Implement Quality Assurance and Testing Measures 
It  is  important  that  the  training  materials  are  relevant,  accurate,  and  well 
presented  in  order  to  increase  training  efectiveness  and  peak  participant 
interest.  As such, all materials should go through a rigorous quality assurance 
and testing process. The Training Lead should develop the quality assurance 
and testing procedures based on the following criteria: 
•  Reviews should be done by resources separate from the training 
development team. A fresh set of resources with a thorough 
understanding of the content and course objectives will provide insight 
into the efectiveness of certain training materials. 
•  Conduct mock training exercises. These exercises can identify gaps 
between training material content and the current version of the system. 
Mock training can be conducted with a sample population of end users to 
ensure training materials align with the system. 
•  Use training materials to educate User Acceptance Testers (UATs). 
Training materials will provide valuable information to train this first 
pilot group of users. In addition, the Training Lead can gain input on the 
efectiveness and usability of the training materials. 
Conduct Training 
Once  the  training  has  been  planned  and  developed,  the  Training  Lead  will 
coordinate  training  delivery,  ensuring  it  aligns  with  the  Project  Schedule. 
When conducting training, regardless of the delivery channel, it is important to 
consider general principles for educating adults. Malcolm Knowles, an educator, 
developed  an  industry-leading  Adult  Learning  Methodology,  which  provides 
guidance in educating adults. He identified four leading guidelines. 
1.  Explain the reasons why specific topics are being taught. 
2.  Instruction should be focused on tasks, instead of memorization. 
3.  The backgrounds of learners should be considered and applied in  
training opportunities.

4.  Adults are self-directed, with a desire to learn and discover on their own; 
however, they still require the ability to seek guidance and help when 
mistakes are made.
