User: How to quickly locate the problems of a deployed web application, such as response delay, high CPU usage, etc., while avoiding impact on users?
Assistant: 1. Use performance monitoring tools: You can use performance monitoring tools such as New Relic, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, etc. These tools continuously monitor application performance and collect data. This data can be used to analyze where your application has previously bottlenecked and pinpoint which resources are being overloaded. 2. Check log files: applications usually store log files locally or remotely, and you can use log files to analyze problems such as response delays and error messages. Tools such as Splunk can be used to efficiently manage and process a large number of logs. 3. Version control tracking issues: You can set version tracking during deployment, so that you can view the indicators and operation details of this version to find out the cause of performance problems. 4. Use simulation test: In order to avoid negative impact on users, you can use load testing tools such as JMeter and LoadRunner to simulate various stress test situations, obtain all relevant performance data, and then analyze, monitor and optimize them. This will give you a realistic testing environment of your deployed application without negatively impacting your current users. 5. Database optimization: If there are problems such as CPU usage, you can properly reduce the time of database query and other operations to avoid high resource consumption. If you need to query a large amount of data, you can cache the data in memory first. 6. Cache data: For data that is frequently queried and consumes a lot of resources, you can use the cache method to cache the data in memory or external storage. This can greatly improve the response speed and avoid resource waste caused by frequent server access to slow databases. Through the above methods, you can quickly locate and solve the problems of the deployed web applications while avoiding negative impact on users.
