### My Life as a Spyware Developer: Why I’m Probably Going to Hell

#### Who Am I?
- **Integrated Solutions Lead for Matrikon (Toronto/Chicago)**
  - Developed custom software for power plants
  - Focused on NERC CIP compliance for the past year
- **Previous Experience**
  - Developed pharmacy systems, online casinos, and dating websites
  - And, most notably, spyware

#### Who Was I?
- A programmer with no background in security or spyware
- Financially struggling
- Found a job listing on Craigslist
- Hired as Product Designer/Lead Developer for a spyware company
- Worked with five other programmers
- Please don’t punch me

#### Features of the Spyware
- **Client Application**
  - Run any application we wanted
  - Add links, icons, and shortcuts
  - Change homepage and search provider
  - Keyword search popups and hyperlinking
  - Check for updates daily
- **Server**
  - Track installs and updates
  - Manage multiple campaigns
  - Upload new versions

#### Polymorphic Installs
- Random filenames and locations
- Random file contents to bypass hash checks
- While I worked there, no malware protection software could remove it
- Explored hiding files in Alternate Data Streams

#### Affiliate Hijacking
- Abused affiliate site referrals
- Redirected users through our affiliate link if they visited a site on our list
- Earned commission on any purchases made
- Managed hundreds of affiliates

#### Kernel Module
- Essentially a rootkit
- Hid all files from the user
- If files were deleted, they were immediately replaced and randomized

#### Technology Used
- **Client Side**
  - Internet Explorer Plugin (Browser Helper Object hooks)
  - Visual C++ 6
- **Server Side**
  - PHP Interface
  - MySQL

#### How Does This Get Installed?
- My boss offered $10k to anyone who found an exploit
- The exploit required:
  - Getting the file onto the computer and out of protected IE zones
  - Running the file
- I found an exploit using a custom .chm file and Windows Media Player
  - Unpatched until XP SP2
- Not illegal, but we covered our bases with a custom installation dialog
- My boss never paid the $10k

#### Installation
- **Standard IE 6 Installer**
- **Custom Installer**
  - Bypasses standard install method
  - Legal disclaimer included just in case
  - Tricky to avoid installation

#### Deployment of the Installer
- Placed the exploit in banner ads
- Websites were unaware of the ads they ran
- We didn’t know which sites we ran on
- Ran the ‘campaign’ for a while, then opened the IFrame with the exploit
- Displayed to a configurable fraction of viewers
- Tracked IP addresses to avoid showing the IFrame twice to the same person

#### What Happens When You Install 20 Pieces of Spyware at Once?
- Some install the .NET framework
- Your computer will be extremely slow
- They try to uninstall each other, including installing antivirus software

#### How Spyware Makes Money
- Our spyware itself did not generate revenue
- My boss made a lot of money by installing other people’s spyware
- Made about 10 cents per install
- Packaged around 20 different spyware packages
- Achieved over 12 million installs

#### Want to Be a Millionaire?
- It’s possible
- The technical part is easy; the challenge is ensuring other spyware companies pay you
- My boss was convinced no laws were broken
- All you need is no conscience

#### How Did It All End?
- Like many internet companies I worked for, they stopped paying me
- Discovered the company was founded at an AA meeting
- Went on to work for the person who was paying my boss
- Quit after working 80 hours a week for a few months
- Prefer to sleep at night
- Listed this period on my resume as contract work
