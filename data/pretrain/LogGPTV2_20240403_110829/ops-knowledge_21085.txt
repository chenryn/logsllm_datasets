Question: "When configuring a Mac with Secure Multi-Boot options and System Integrity Protection, various settings can be adjusted that have implications for the system's security posture. Which of the following are potential consequences of altering these settings?"
 "A": "Changing the smb1 setting to 'true' will allow Secure Enclave signed custom kernel collections, increasing flexibility in managing kernel extensions."
 "B": "Setting sip2 to 'true' can prevent the Configurable Text Read-only Region (CTRR) hardware register from locking, potentially exposing kernel memory to write operations."
 "C": "Modifying the sip3 setting to 'true' could bypass the built-in allow list for boot-args, enabling unrestricted passing of options to the kernel."
 "D": "Enabling smb4 will disable MDM control of the operating system, reverting the device to local user authentication only."
