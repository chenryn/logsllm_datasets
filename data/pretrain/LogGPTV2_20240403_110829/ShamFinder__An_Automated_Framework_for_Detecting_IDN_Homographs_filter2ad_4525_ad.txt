complemented the zone file by using another list of domain names
named domainlists.io [7]. The union set of the two lists contains
141.2 M of unique domain names. As mentioned above, we can ex-
tract IDNs by searching for domain names starting with the prefix
“xn--”.
Table 6 summarizes the number of domain names/IDNs for each
dataset. We first notice that a non-negligible number of IDNs are
currently registered in the .com TLD, implying the widespread
adoption of IDN in the wild. Next, we examined the languages used
in those IDNs to understand which Unicode blocks are widely used
in the IDNs. To detect the language used in a string, we leveraged
a tool known as LangID [20], which is a Python module that can
detect the most plausible language out of 97 distinct languages for

a given string. Table 7 presents the results. We see that east Asian
languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are dominantly used
for composing IDNs wheres several European languages are also
popular for this purpose. This observation implies that the demand
for the use of native languages is ubiquitous.
6 DETECTING IDN HOMOGRAPHS WITH
THE SHAMFINDER FRAMEWORK.
In this section, we apply the ShamFinder framework to the data
we described in the previous sections. We first studied the IDN
homographs that targeted popular domain names that reside in
the .com TLD. We then studied the malicious IDN homographs
detected by our approach. In comparison to the existing approach,
we compared the number of detected malicious IDN homographs
by changing the homoglyph database. As discussed in Section 8,
the previous approach to detecting IDN homographs proposed by
Quinkert et al. [26] leveraged UC as their homoglyph database.
That is, we can directly compare the IDN homograph detection
performance between their approach (UC only) and ours (UC and
SimChar).
6.1 Statistics of the IDN Homographs
Table 8 presents the number of detected IDN homographs targeting
ASCII-character domain names. When we used UC, the ShamFinder
framework detected 436 IDN homographs out of the 955 K IDNs
registered in the .com TLD. On the other hand, when we used
SimChar, more than 3,110 of IDN homographs were detected. In
total, by using both homoglyph databases, we detected 3,280 IDN

homographs, which is approximately eight times more than those
detected with UC. Thus, the adoption of SimChar as the homoglyph
database enables us to detect more IDN homographs than existing
approaches such as that of Quinkert [26].
Table 9 presents the the top-5 domain names that have the
most IDN homographs. Three of these domains, google.com, ama-
zon.com, and facebook.com are all popular domains; however, the
two other domains, myetherwallet.com and allstate.com are not
that popular compared to the other three domains. In fact, the first
three domains are ranked among the top-10 domains in the Alexa
ranking, whereas the other two domains are ranked 7,400th and
5,148th among the .com TLD domains in the Alexa ranking, respec-
tively. This observation demonstrates that IDN homograph attacks
not only target very popular websites, they also target other mod-
erately popular websites, implying that starting with a small list of
reference domains may not be effective for IDN homographs that
target minor domains. We discuss this issue below (Section 6.4).
In the following, we analyze the IDNs that are currently active.
First, we checked the NS records for the 3,280 homograph IDNs
we detected. We found 2,294 domain names with NS records, while
other domain names did not have NS records due to some reasons
such as expiration, non-registration, etc. Of the 2,294 domain names,
385 domain names did not have A records. For the remaining 1,909
domain names, we performed port scans to the ports TCP/80 and
TCP/443. Table 10 shows the results. We found that the 1,647 IDN
homographs we detected were reachable through the HTTP or
HTTPS; i.e., roughly half of the detected IDN homographs were
active.
6.2 Deep Inspection of the Active IDN
Homographs
In this section, we further inspect the characteristics of the active
IDN homographs we found in the previous subsection. In the fol-
lowing, we show the analyses from two aspects: (1) analysis of the
popular IDN homographs and (2) classification of IDN homographs.
(1) Analysis of the popular IDN homographs
458
To study how the active IDN homographs have been accessed by
end users, we focus on the “popular” IDN homographs that likely
attracted large number of end-users. To this end, we performed
the analysis using the passive DNS [9], which is a DNS monitoring
system that is composed of several working DNS cache servers. A
passive DNS system provides useful statistics such as the number of
cumulative name resolutions for each domain name. We note that
the statistics provided by a passive DNS system reflects sampled
data collected at a set of cache servers contributing to the system.
Therefore, the actual numbers of DNS lookups over the entire In-
ternet should be much larger than those obtained from a passive
DNS system. We also note that the number of web accesses and
number of DNS resolutions are different. However, we believe that
the number of DNS resolutions is correlated with the popularity of
a domain name, given that every first web query should be preceded
by a DNS query.
Table 11 shows the top-10 domain names that had the largest
numbers of DNS lookups. We studied the categories of the websites
running on the IDNs by manual inspection. We found that of the
top-10 IDNs, four of them targeted gmail.com. In particular, the
top IDN, gmaıl[.]com was an active phishing site and had a large
number of name resolutions, implying that there have been a large
number of end-users who accessed the phishing website2. We found
that the website under the IDN employed a cloaking technique to
redirect a visitor to the different websites according to the User-
agent of the visitor’s browser. We also found that the majority of
the IDNs were parked domains; these were used for monetizing
through advertisements and/or were reserved for resale.
In Table 11, the columns “MX,” “Web link,” and “SNS” represent,
whether there was a generic website linking to the IDN homograph,
and whether there was a web link pointing to the IDN homograph
on popular SNS websites such as Twitter. We used the search en-
gines for the latter two analyses. We found that the IDN homo-
graphs that target domain names used for email services such as
gmail.com and yahoo.com have MX records either in the past or
in the present. We also saw that several IDN homographs have
appeared in public webspace, including SNS. These observations
imply that the owners of these IDN homographs have attempted to
make the IDN homographs publicly visible.
(2) Classification of IDN homographs
We now attempt to classify the 1,647 active IDN homographs
that responded to either TCP/80 or TCP/443. To this end, we make
use of a list of NS records for the domain parking companies, screen-
shots of the websites, and VirusTotal [43], which is an online virus
scanner. To compile a list NS records for the domain parking com-
panies, we leverage the list and methods proposed in [4, 44]. We
added several NS records and ended up 17 of NS records used for
domain parking.
Next, for the remaining IDN homographs that were not attributed
to domain parking, we accessed to the corresponding websites
via the two schemes, HTTP and HTTPS, and took screenshots
using the puppeteer [25], which is a headless browser that provides
APIs to control Chrome or Chromium. Based on the characteristics

website to the security vendors.

of screenshots and HTTP responses, we classified the websites
into the following five categories: “For sale,” “Redirect,”, “Normal,”,
“Empty,” and “Error,” which represent a website that encourages
you to buy the domain, a website that redirects to another website,
a website that displays something legitimate successfully, a website
that displays nothing, and a website that failed to get a screenshot
due to a timeout or other reasons, respectively.
Table 12 shows the results. We found that 693 (42%) of the web-
sites running on IDN homographs were used for business (“Domain
parking” or “For sale”). We also found that 338 (21%) of the websites
running on IDN homographs were redirected to other websites hav-
ing different domain names. We further analyzed these 338 websites
using VirusTotal and manual inspection of the screenshots. Table 13
shows the breakdown of the websites with redirect. Brand protec-
tion indicates that a website running on a homograph domain name
is redirected to the website running on the corresponding original
domain name. That is, the owner of the original domain name has
registered the homograph to protect their brand. We found that
while the majority of the redirected domain names were attributed
to either brand protection or legitimate websites, we found 35 of
them were detected as malicious websites.
6.3 Malicious IDN Homographs
To check whether the detected IDN homographs have been used
for malicious purposes, we leveraged three different sources of
blacklists, hpHosts [17], Google Safe Browsing (GSB) [14], and
Symantec DeepSight [33]; of the three lists, hpHosts, which is a
