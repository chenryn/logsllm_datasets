### Complementing the Zone File and Analyzing IDNs

To enhance the zone file, we utilized an additional list of domain names from `domainlists.io` [7]. The combined (union) set of these two lists contains 141.2 million unique domain names. As previously mentioned, we can identify Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) by searching for domain names that start with the prefix "xn--".

#### Table 6: Summary of Domain Name Lists and IDN Counts
| Data Source | Number of Domain Names | Number of IDNs | Collection Time |
|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Zone File [42] | 140,900,279 | 952,352 (0.67%) | May 2019 |
| domainlists.io [7] | 139,667,014 | 953,209 (0.73%) | May 2019 |
| Total (Union) | 141,212,035 | 955,512 (0.67%) | - |

We observed a significant number of IDNs registered in the .com top-level domain (TLD), indicating the widespread adoption of IDNs. To understand the languages used in these IDNs, we employed LangID [20], a Python module capable of detecting the most likely language out of 97 distinct languages.

#### Table 7: Top Languages Used for IDNs
| Rank | Language | Number of IDNs | Fraction (%) |
|------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| 1    | Chinese  | 443,865        | 46.5         |
| 2    | Korean   | 101,711        | 10.6         |
| 3    | Japanese | 88,970         | 9.3          |
| 4    | German   | 53,776         | 5.6          |
| 5    | Turkish  | 35,288         | 3.6          |

East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) are predominantly used in IDNs, while several European languages are also popular. This suggests a universal demand for using native languages in domain names.

### Detecting IDN Homographs with the ShamFinder Framework

In this section, we apply the ShamFinder framework to the data described in the previous sections. We first examined IDN homographs targeting popular domain names in the .com TLD and then analyzed the malicious IDN homographs detected by our approach. We compared the number of detected malicious IDN homographs by changing the homoglyph database. The existing approach by Quinkert et al. [26] uses the Unicode Consortium (UC) as their homoglyph database, allowing a direct comparison with our approach, which uses both UC and SimChar.

#### 6.1 Statistics of the IDN Homographs

#### Table 8: Number of Detected IDN Homographs for ASCII Domains
| Homoglyph DB | Number of IDN Homographs |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| UC            | 436                       |
| SimChar       | 3,110                     |
| UC ∪ SimChar  | 3,280                     |

Using the ShamFinder framework, we detected 436 IDN homographs with UC and 3,110 with SimChar, totaling 3,280 IDN homographs. This is approximately eight times more than those detected with UC alone, demonstrating the effectiveness of including SimChar in the homoglyph database.

#### Table 9: Top-5 ASCII Domain Names with the Most IDN Homographs
| Rank | Domain Name           | Number of Homographs |
|------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| 1    | myetherwallet.com     | 170                  |
| 2    | google.com            | 114                  |
| 3    | amazon.com            | 75                   |
| 4    | facebook.com          | 72                   |
| 5    | allstate.com          | 68                   |

Three of these domains (google.com, amazon.com, and facebook.com) are highly popular, while myetherwallet.com and allstate.com are less so. This indicates that IDN homograph attacks target both very popular and moderately popular websites.

### Analysis of Active IDN Homographs

We analyzed the 3,280 detected homograph IDNs. We found 2,294 domain names with NS records, and 385 of these did not have A records. For the remaining 1,909 domain names, we performed port scans on TCP/80 and TCP/443.

#### Table 10: Port Scan Results for Detected IDN Homographs
| Ports                 | Number of Domain Names |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
| TCP/80                | 1,642                  |
| TCP/443               | 700                    |
| TCP/80 & TCP/443      | 695                    |
| Total (Unique)        | 1,647                  |

Approximately half of the detected IDN homographs were active, being reachable through HTTP or HTTPS.

#### 6.2 Deep Inspection of Active IDN Homographs

We further inspected the characteristics of the 1,647 active IDN homographs from two perspectives: (1) analysis of popular IDN homographs and (2) classification of IDN homographs.

**1. Analysis of Popular IDN Homographs**

We used passive DNS [9] to study how these active IDN homographs have been accessed by end users. Passive DNS provides statistics such as the number of cumulative name resolutions for each domain name.

#### Table 11: Top-10 Active IDNs with the Largest Number of DNS Resolutions
| Category   | Domain Name             | #Resolutions | MX | Web Link | SNS |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------|----|----------|-----|
| Phishing   | gmaıl[.]com             | 615,447      | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |
| Portal     | döviz[.]com             | 74,699       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |
| Parked     | 'gmail[.]com            | 63,233       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |
| Parked     | gmàil[.]com             | 56,918       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |

| Parked     | yàhoo[.]com             | 37,713       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |
| Parked     | shädbase[.]com          | 36,405       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |

| Parked     | perú[.]com              | 38,556       | ✓  | ✓        | ✓   |

Four of the top-10 IDNs targeted gmail.com, with the top IDN, gmaıl[.]com, being an active phishing site. Many of the IDNs were parked domains, used for monetization through advertisements or reserved for resale.

**2. Classification of IDN Homographs**

We classified the 1,647 active IDN homographs into five categories: "For sale," "Redirect," "Normal," "Empty," and "Error."

#### Table 12: Classification of Active IDN Homographs
| Category        | Numbers |
|-----------------|---------|
| Domain parking  | 348     |
| For sale        | 345     |
| Redirect        | 338     |
| Normal          | 281     |
| Empty           | 222     |
| Error           | 113     |
| **Total**       | 1,647   |

We found that 693 (42%) of the websites running on IDN homographs were used for business ("Domain parking" or "For sale"). Additionally, 338 (21%) of the websites were redirected to other websites.

#### Table 13: Classification of Websites with Redirects
| Category         | Numbers |
|------------------|---------|
| Brand protection | 178     |
| Legitimate site  | 125     |
| Malicious site   | 35      |
| **Total**        | 338     |

Most redirected domain names were attributed to brand protection or legitimate websites, but 35 were detected as malicious.

### 6.3 Malicious IDN Homographs

To check if the detected IDN homographs were used for malicious purposes, we leveraged three blacklists: hpHosts [17], Google Safe Browsing (GSB) [14], and Symantec DeepSight [33].

#### Table 14: Number of Malicious IDN Homographs
| Homoglyph DB | hpHosts | GSB | Symantec |
|---------------|---------|-----|----------|
| UC            | 1       | 7   | 8        |
| SimChar       | 222     | 28  | 2        |
| UC ∪ SimChar  | 242     | 12  | 13       |

Our results show that the inclusion of SimChar in the homoglyph database significantly increased the detection of malicious IDN homographs.
