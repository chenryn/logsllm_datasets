### Ontology Tools and Environments for Construction and Management

#### Reusing Existing Ontologies
Users can reuse existing ontologies from a modular, structured library. Familiarity with KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format) and the Ontolingua language is essential. The interface, however, is not very user-friendly. The following formats are supported for import and export: DAML+OIL, KIF, OKBC, LOOM, Prolog, Ontolingua, and CLIPS.

#### Altova SemanticWorks
Altova SemanticWorks is a commercial visual editor that offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionalities. Users can print graphical RDF and OWL representations to create documentation for Semantic Web implementations. The tool allows switching between a graphical RDF/OWL view and a text view, enabling users to see how documents are being built in RDF/XML, OWL, or N-triples format. The code is automatically generated based on the user’s design. Supported file formats include N-triples, XML, OWL, RDF, and RDFS.

#### OilEd
OilEd’s interface is heavily influenced by Stanford’s Protégé toolkit. While it does not provide a full ontology development environment, it allows users to build and check ontologies for consistency using the FaCT reasoner. The internal data format is DAML+OIL, and it supports importing from DAML+OIL and exporting to RDFS, DAML+OIL, RDF/XML, and other formats.

#### WebODE
WebODE is a web-based application that supports various ontology-related activities, including edition, navigation, documentation, merging, reasoning, and more. It enables the creation of user groups for collaborative ontology editing and provides automatic export and import services for XML.

#### pOWL
pOWL is an open-source, PHP-based ontology management tool designed for collaborative environments. It supports parsing, storing, querying, manipulation, versioning, serving, and serialization of RDFS and OWL knowledge bases. pOWL is capable of handling ontologies of any size and includes an RDQL query builder. It also features version control and support for heterogeneous data and its formal description.

#### SWOOP
SWOOP is a web-based OWL ontology editor and browser. It includes OWL validation and multiple presentation syntax views, as well as reasoning support and a multi-ontology environment. Users can compare, edit, and merge ontologies. Collaborative annotation is possible with the Annotea plug-in, and external ontological data can be reused.

### Summary of Ontology Tools
There are several types of ontology tools available:
- **Commercial Tools**: Examples include SemanticWorks and OntoStudio.
- **Language-Specific Tools**: These require knowledge of specific languages, such as Ontolingua and OilEd.
- **Graphical Tools**: Tools like IsaViz and SemanticWorks offer a more visual approach.
- **Web-Based Applications**: Examples include WebODE, pOWL, and SWOOP.
- **Methodology-Focused Tools**: DOE and WebODE follow specific methodologies.

These tools vary in their support for common editing and browsing functionalities, ontology documentation, import/export capabilities, graphical views, ontology libraries, and integrated inference engines.

### Comparison of Available Ontology Tools
In this chapter, we compared a selection of available ontology tools and environments for constructing ontologies, either from scratch or by reusing existing ones. As shown, there are many ontology development tools available for various needs.
