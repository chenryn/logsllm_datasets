can reuse existing ontologies from a modular structured library. It is important that
users have some notions of KIF and of the Ontolingua language. The interface is not
very user friendly. It is possible to export or import to the following formats:
DAML+OIL, KIF, OKBC, LOOM, Prolog, Ontolingua, CLIPS.
Altova SemanticWorks is a commercial visual editor that has an intuitive visual
interface and drag-and-drop functionalities. Users are capable of printing the graphical
RDF and OWL representations to create documentation for Semantic Web
implementations. It is possible to switch from the graphical RDF/OWL view to the text
view to see how documents are being built in RDF/XML, OWL or N-triples format.
The code is automatically generated based on the user’s design. This editor has the
ability to manage the following files: N-triples, XML, OWL, RDF and RDFS.
OilEd’s interface was strongly influenced by Stanford’s Protégé toolkit. This editor
does not provide a full ontology development environment. However, allows users to
build ontologies and to check ontologies for consistency by using FaCT reasoner.
OilEd’s internal data format is DAML+OIL. It is possible to import from DAML+OIL
and export ontologies as RDFS, DAML OWL, RDF/XML and others formats.
WebODE is a Web application. This editor supports ontology edition, navigation,
documentation, merge, reasoning and other activities involved in the ontology
development process. User groups can be created to collaborate in the edition of
ontologies. WebODE has automatic exportation and importation services from and into
XML.
pOWL (Auer, 2005) is a PHP-based open source ontology management tool. pOWL
is capable of supporting parsing, storing, querying, manipulation, versioning, serving
and serialization of RDFS and OWL knowledge bases in a collaborative Web enabled
environment. This editor was designed to work with ontologies of arbitrary size. pOWL
offers an RDQL query builder. pOWL has versioning control. pOWL supports
heterogeneous data and its formal description.
SWOOP is a Web-based OWL ontology editor and browser. SWOOP contains OWL
validation and offers various OWL presentation syntax views. It has reasoning support
and provides a multiple ontology environment. Ontologies can be compared, edited and
merged. It is possible to have collaborative annotation with the Annotea plug-in. Users
can reuse external ontological data.
To sum up, there are commercial ontology tools (Semantic Works and OntoStudio),
there are ontology tools that demand learning/knowing a specific language (Ontolingua
and OilEd) and there are ontology tools that are more graphic (IsaViz and Semantic
Works). Other tools are Web-based application (WebODE, pOWL and SWOOP) or
follow a methodology (DOE and WebODE).
There are several available ontology tools that can help to build an ontology. Some
tools only support common edition and browsing functionalities. Other tools provide
ontology documentation, ontology import/export for different formats, graphical view
of ontologies, ontology libraries and attached inference engines.
In this chapter, we compared a selection of some of the available ontologies tool and
environments that can be used for ontology construction, either from scratch or by
reusing other existing ontologies. As we have shown, there are many ontology
development tools for ontology construction

Annex 2
The following table (Table 2) lists the features that we considered more important when
deciding which ontology tool to use: versioning; collaborative ontology edition;
graphical class/properties taxonomy; graphical tree view; support the growth of large
scale ontologies; querying; friendly user interface; consistency check and OWL editor.
The feature versioning keeps track of the version evolution that the ontology suffers.
The collaborative ontology edition is a very useful feature since it allows users to edit
ontologies in a collaborative manner. The graphical class/properties taxonomy provides
an interesting view of the classes and of the properties of the ontology. This feature
permits viewing classes and properties with graphically. The graphical tree view shows
a generic graph view of the ontology. It is possible to have an overview of the structure
of the ontology. If the ontology editor supports the growth of large scale ontologies,
then the user can be sure that it is possible to build an ontology by using only one editor.
The feature concerning querying allows querying the knowledge base. It is important
that the user interface is friendly and similar to others interface. As a result, the user
does not need to spend too much time getting to know the tool. Consistency checking is
important in order to look for propagation of the arity all along the hierarchy and
inheritance of domains.
