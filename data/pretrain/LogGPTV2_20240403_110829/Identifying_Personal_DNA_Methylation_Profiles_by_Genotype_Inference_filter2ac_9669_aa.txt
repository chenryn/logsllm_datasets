Abstract—Since
sequencing,
the ﬁrst whole-genome
the
biomedical research community has made signiﬁcant steps to-
wards a more precise, predictive and personalized medicine.
Genomic data is nowadays widely considered privacy-sensitive
and consequently protected by strict regulations and released
only after careful consideration. Various additional types of
biomedical data, however, are not shielded by any dedicated legal
means and consequently disseminated much less thoughtfully.
This in particular holds true for DNA methylation data as one
of the most important and well-understood epigenetic element
inﬂuencing human health.
In this paper, we show that, in contrast to the aforementioned
belief, releasing one’s DNA methylation data causes privacy issues
akin to releasing one’s actual genome. We show that already
a small subset of methylation regions inﬂuenced by genomic
variants are sufﬁcient to infer parts of someone’s genome, and to
further map this DNA methylation proﬁle to the corresponding
genome. Notably, we show that such re-identiﬁcation is possible
with 97.5% accuracy, relying on a dataset of more than 2500
genomes, and that we can reject all wrongly matched genomes
using an appropriate statistical test. We provide means for
countering this threat by proposing a novel cryptographic scheme
for privately classifying tumors that enables a privacy-respecting
medical diagnosis in a common clinical setting. The scheme
relies on a combination of random forests and homomorphic
encryption, and it is proven secure in the honest-but-curious
model. We evaluate this scheme on real DNA methylation data,
and show that we can keep the computational overhead to
acceptable values for our application scenario.
I. INTRODUCTION
Since the ﬁrst whole-genome sequencing in 2001, the cost
of molecular proﬁling has been plummeting, enabling a signif-
icant progress in biomedical science and the rise of precision
medicine [1]. This scientiﬁc breakthrough is triggered by
the increasing availability of biomedical data, whose main
negative counterpart is the new threat towards health privacy.
The extent of the threat, and mechanisms to mitigate it, have
been extensively studied regarding the genomic data. The
various attack vectors and protection techniques have been
well surveyed and categorized back in 2014 already [2]. The
genome is especially privacy sensitive as it uniquely identiﬁes
someone, it is very stable over our whole lifetime, and it
is correlated among relatives [3]. This may explain why the
security community has been, so far, focusing essentially on
enhancing the privacy of genomic data, and not the other
types of biomedical data, such as epigenetic data, despite their

vital functions for human health and their rapidly growing
availability [4].
DNA methylation is one of the most important and best
understood epigenetic elements inﬂuencing human health. It is
an essential regulator of gene transcription. As a consequence,
aberrant DNA methylation patterns (such as hypermethylation
and hypomethylation) have been associated with a large num-
ber of cancer types [5], [6], [7]. Because of its crucial role in
human health, DNA methylation data might constitute highly
sensitive data as well, whose privacy should be protected using
dedicated legal or technical means. However, epigenetic data
might not even be considered as genetic information in the
strict legal sense, and thus not be protected by legal frame-
works, such as the US Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act (GINA) [8], [9].
Contrary to the genome, DNA methylation data, and more
generally epigenetic data, vary quite signiﬁcantly over time,
mainly because they are highly inﬂuenced by environmental
factors. This may explain why DNA methylation data are
simply released (without identiﬁers) on open online platforms
with nonrestricted access. In order to prevent privacy breaches,
the genomic data corresponding to the DNA methylation data
are generally not made publicly available, and follow stricter
privacy rules. However, it is well-known that DNA methylation
is also inﬂuenced by genetic factors [10]. As a consequence,
correlations between DNA methylation and the genome could
be exploited in order to re-identify anonymous DNA methy-
lation proﬁles by using some public genomic database (e.g.,
OpenSNP [11]). Unfortunately, previous work has only tackled
potential re-identiﬁcation risks and countermeasures from a
relatively high-level qualitative perspective (see Section IX). In
this work, we provide the ﬁrst detailed quantitative assessment
of the identiﬁcation risks inherent to DNA methylation data
and, moreover, propose a provably secure technical mechanism
to enable privacy-preserving methylation-based diagnosis.
a) Contributions: Speciﬁcally, we present a Bayesian
inference framework to predict part of the genotype from DNA
methylation data. We then propose an algorithm that matches
DNA methylation proﬁles to the genotypes whose posterior
probabilities are maximized given these methylation proﬁles.
By using a rich methylation-genotype dataset, we show that
only a few tens of methylation regions are sufﬁcient
to

accurately match DNA methylation to genotypes. Furthermore,
we present a statistical method that enables us to reject the
small fraction of cases where the matching algorithm does not
provide 100% accuracy, e.g., when the genotype corresponding
to the methylation proﬁle is not part of the genotype dataset.
We also observe that, in such cases, if a relative is part of
the genotypes’ dataset, it is the one (wrongly) matched to
the methylation proﬁle. By including all genotypes contained
in phase 3 of the 1000 Genome Project, we show that the
attack success is very robust to an increase in the size of the
genotype dataset. All accuracy, false-positive and true-positive
rates remain constant for a size of the genotype dataset varying
from 75 to 2579.
Given the extent of the threat, we propose a novel crypto-
graphic scheme for privately classifying tumors, which enables
a privacy-preserving medical diagnosis in a common clinical
setting. With our method, neither a curious third-party running
the machine-learning algorithm can learn the personal DNA
methylation data, nor the data owner (e.g., the patient) can
learn the detailed machine-learning model. In particular, we
adapt existing homomorphic schemes for privately evaluating
random forests with encrypted data, and prove the resulting
scheme secure in the honest-but-curious adversarial model,
which constitutes the state-of-the-art adversary model in this
problem setting. We evaluate the classiﬁer performance on
real methylation data, and show that it can precisely classify
brain tumors in 9 subtype classes based on 900 methylation
levels in less than an hour, which represents a fully tolerable
computational time for the considered application scenario.
b) Organization: In Section II, we introduce the relevant
concepts and properties of DNA methylation. In Section III,
we present the considered adversarial model. We then detail
the analytical method behind our identiﬁcation attack in Sec-
tion IV. We describe our dataset in Section V before using it to
evaluate the success of our attack in Section VI. In Section VII,
we present our private classiﬁcation algorithm and evaluate
its performance in Section VIII. We review the most relevant
previous work in Section IX, before concluding in Section X.
We provide the detailed security proofs of our cryptographic
scheme in the Appendix.
II. BACKGROUND
Methylation of the DNA is one of the most
important
epigenetic modiﬁcations in the genome, with profound conse-
quences on the structure and the activity of the DNA molecule
[12], [13]. It has been observed in numerous species (animals
and plants), but some species lack this mechanism. It consists
in the addition of a methyl group to the cytosines or adenine
by speciﬁc enzymes called methyltransferases; however in
humans, only cytosine methylation in CpG-dinucleotides, lead-
ing to the formation of 5-methylcytosine, has been observed.
Given its mostly repressive effect on gene expression, DNA
methylation at the promoter of genes is a mechanism by which
genes can be silenced during development, for example to
maintain the pluripotent state of stem cells [14].
Aberrant changes in the DNA methylation patterns, which
are frequently observed in cancer, can lead to the hyper-
activation of genes such as oncogenes, or the silencing of
tumor suppressor genes [5]. While the changes in the DNA
methylation pattern can be dramatic in cancer, DNA methyla-
tion in normal tissues can also be modiﬁed due to, for example,
environmental inﬂuences. It has been shown in diverse studies
that environmental cues such as pollution, exposure to stress
or cigarette smoke leads to changes in the DNA methylation of
the genome for persons exposed to these inﬂuences [15], [16],
[17], [18]. Recently, several studies analyzed the inﬂuence
of these external effects on the methylation patterns in a
cohort of mothers and children and found massive number of
differentially methylated regions when comparing children of
smoking and non-smoking mothers, with downstream effects
on the expression of genes involved in important pathways of
lung development and maturation [15], [16].
Besides external factors, the genotype of an individual can
also affect the methylation of certain regions [19], [10], [20].
Individuals carrying particular alleles at some single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) can exhibit speciﬁc DNA methylation
patterns at some loci. Such SNPs having an inﬂuence on
the methylation are called methylation quantitative trait loci
(meQTLs), and have been studied previously to uncover the
mechanisms by which single nucleotide polymorphisms can
have a effect on the methylation patterns. An obvious effect
is when the polymorphism affects a CpG dinucleotide. If the
polymorphism affects the cytosine (C) or the guanine (G),
the CpG dinucleotide is lost, leading to a loss of methylation
at
this site. However, other polymorphisms beyond these
“CpG destroying SNPs” can lead to methylation changes.
Given this possible link between varying genotypes and DNA
methylation, the question is to what extent knowledge of the
DNA methylation pattern could be used to reverse-engineer
the meQTLs and predict genotypes based on the methylation.
III. THREAT MODEL
We assume that the adversary gets access to one or multiple
individual proﬁles of genome-wide DNA methylation levels, as
well as to a set of genotypes. There are around 28 million CpG
sites per individual and about 150 million known genomic
variants to which the adversary can potentially have access.
Then, we study various scenarios that could occur in practice.
A typical example is to map a given anonymized DNA methy-
lation proﬁle to a genotype in order to re-identify it. Indeed,
genomic data can facilitate de-anonymization, because there
are already many proﬁles publicly available online with real
identiﬁers, but also because it includes information about phe-
notypic traits, and kinship that can be further matched to side
channels such as surname-genome associations databases [21]
or online social networks [22]. Moreover, the genome is very
stable over our whole lifetime, and thus cannot be revoked.
Note that we assume the adversary to have no prior knowl-
edge about the presence of the target’s genotype in the set
of genotypes. Thus, the adversary also wants to determine
whether the genomic proﬁle that most likely matches to DNA

methylation proﬁle belongs to the same person. In other words,
the adversary also tests if the owner of the DNA methylation
proﬁle is also part of the genomic dataset. We also study
if familial relationships can mislead the adversary about the
genotype corresponding to the methylation proﬁle.
In the private classiﬁcation model, we consider an honest-
but-curious adversary as this assumption is standard in previ-
ous works on privacy-preserving medical diagnosis in a clin-
ical setting [23], [24], [25], [26]. Indeed, it seems reasonable
to assume that involved parties in the healthcare setting, such
as hospitals or medical practitioners, will follow the protocol
honestly. We leave the strengthening of our protocols to work
with active adversaries for future investigations.
IV. ATTACK METHODOLOGY
We present here our de-anonymization attack from a theo-
retical perspective. The attack relies upon the matching of one
or multiple DNA methylation proﬁles to their corresponding
genotypes. To do so, the adversary ﬁrst infers the probability
of a genotype given only methylation data, and second maps
the methylation proﬁle to the genotype that maximizes the
average posterior probabilities between genotypic positions
and methylation sites. Once the best matching has been found
by the adversary, he also wants to be sure that the methylation
and genotypic samples in the matching pair belongs to the
same person. Indeed, it could be that an individual is part of the
DNA methylation dataset but not of the genotype dataset, or
vice versa. To verify this, the adversary relies on a test statistic
related to the matching score that provides him with a degree
of certainty about whether the matching between methylation
data and genotype is signiﬁcant enough to be considered
correct. If there is not enough certainty, the adversary can
conclude that the corresponding genotype is most likely not
part of the dataset.
A. Learning the Attack Model
The probabilistic relationships between methylation levels
and genotypes are derived by relying on a separate training
dataset T = {( (cid:2)mi, (cid:2)gi)}t
i=1 containing t pairs of DNA methy-
lation levels’ proﬁles and their corresponding genotypes. In
practice, methylation proﬁles (cid:2)mi and genotypes (cid:2)gi have tens of
millions of different positions. Speciﬁcally, the training phase
aims: (i) to determine the meQTLs, i.e., the positions q in
the genotype inﬂuencing the methylation levels in a region r,
and (ii) to learn the magnitude of this inﬂuence. During this
training phase, we select a subset G of n independent meQTLs
gq
i , and determine, for each of them, the single most correlated
i over all the t pairs. In case more
methylation region mr
than one methylation region is most correlated with the same
meQTL, we pair the highest correlated methylation region with
the given meQTL ﬁrst, and then pair the other methylation
region with the second most correlated meQTL, and so on
and so forth. This eventually provides us with a set of
methylation region-meQTL position pairs Q = {(rj, qj)}n
j=1,
where ∀(rj, qj), (rk, qk) ∈ Q : rj (cid:4)= rk ⇔ qj (cid:4)= qk.
Once we have identiﬁed the positions in the genotype that
inﬂuence most DNA methylation, we are interested in inferring
the posterior probability of every meQTL gi
