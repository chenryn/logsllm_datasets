User: I'm trying for ages to access a 32bit C compiled lib within an 64bit Ubuntu. I'm using python and CDLL lib in order to make it happen but with no success so far. I can easily open the same 32bit lib on a 32bit OS, and the 64bit version on a 64bit OS.
So, what I'm asking is if anyone knows a way to encapsulate/sandbox/wrap the lib so I can achieve my goal. That way I can use a single 64bit server to access the 32 and 64bit versions of those libs.
If someone knows another python lib that can make the trick please let me know.
Assistant: I am not sure if you can do this in the same process - we are talking about arithmetic here: 32bit pointers are different from 64bit pointers, so trying to reference them in the same process ... well, I am not sure what happens when trying to access a memory area which is not accessible or which is not supposed to be accessed (I guess Segmentation fault? ).
The only solution I can think of is it to have a separate Python 32 bit instance that runs in its own process. Then, with some form of IPC you can call the python32 bit instance from your 64 bit instance.
