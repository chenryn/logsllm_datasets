User: What is the difference between MongoDB and MySQL? In which application scenarios is it more suitable to use MongoDB?
Assistant: MongoDB and MySQL have the following differences: 1. Different data storage methods: MongoDB uses document storage, which can simplify the development of medium-complexity applications. MySQL uses the traditional tabular relational database storage method. 2. Different data models: MongoDB supports dynamic data models, which can easily store data of different structures. However, the data model of MySQL is relatively rigid, and the table structure needs to be designed in advance. 3. Different scalability: MongoDB supports distributed horizontal expansion, which can easily achieve high-level scalability. However, MySQL has weak scalability and needs to improve performance through vertical expansion. In the following application scenarios, using MongoDB is more suitable: 1. Application scenarios that need to store a large amount of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media, Internet of Things, e-commerce, etc. 2. Application scenarios that require high concurrent read and write operations, such as games, real-time data analysis, etc. 3. Need to support distributed deployment and easy-to-expand application scenarios, such as cloud computing, big data analysis, etc.
