### Issue Type:
- **Bug Report**

### Ansible Version:
- **Ansible version:** 1.9.2
- **Jinja2 version:** 2.8
- **Installation method:** `pip install` on the OS described below

### Ansible Configuration:
- No changes made to the default configuration.

### Environment:
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 14.04.03 LTS
- **Virtual Environment:** Not used
- **Installation Method:** `pip install`

### Summary:
Jinja 2.1 introduced the ability to use variables from a for loop in an included template. According to the Jinja documentation (http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#include):

> **Note:**
> In Jinja 2.0, the context passed to the included template did not include variables defined in the template. As a result, the following code would not work:
>
> ```jinja
> {% for box in boxes %}
>    {% include "render_box.html" %}
> {% endfor %}
> ```
>
> The included template `render_box.html` could not access the `box` variable in Jinja 2.0. This feature was added in Jinja 2.1, allowing `render_box.html` to access the `box` variable.

Although I am using Jinja 2.8 with Ansible 1.9, this feature is either unavailable or broken in the Ansible template module. This report is not a request for new feature support but rather a request to fix a broken feature.

### Steps to Reproduce:
To reproduce the bug, use the following playbook:

```yaml
---
- hosts: desktop
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    nom: "Toto!"
    some_list:
      - "elmt 1"
      - "elmt 2"
  tasks:
  - name: "test"
    template: 
      src: /tmp/tmpl
      dest: /tmp/output
```

The `/tmp/tmpl` file contains:

```jinja
hello {{ nom }}
{% for elmt in some_list %}
{% include 'do_smth_with_elmt' with context %}
{% endfor %}
```

The `/tmp/do_smth_with_elmt` file contains:

```jinja
Print {{ elmt }}
```

### Expected Results:
- No error message from Ansible.
- The template should be rendered correctly.

### Actual Results:
- Output from Ansible:
  ```
  PLAY [desktop] **************************************************************** 
  TASK: [test] ****************************************************************** 
  fatal: [desktop.local] => {'msg': "AnsibleUndefinedVariable: One or more undefined variables: 'elmt' is undefined", 'failed': True}
  fatal: [desktop.local] => {'msg': "AnsibleUndefinedVariable: One or more undefined variables: 'elmt' is undefined", 'failed': True}
  FATAL: all hosts have already failed -- aborting
  PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 
             to retry, use: --limit @/home/user/test.retry
  desktop.local              : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0 
  ```

### Comment:
If I had to pinpoint the issue, I would suspect the `new_context` system in the `J2Template` class:
- https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-1.9/lib/ansible/utils/template.py#L212-L213

However, I am not familiar with the Ansible source code, so I may be incorrect. For reference, the following Python script runs without issues on my machine:

```python
import jinja2
loader = jinja2.FileSystemLoader('/tmp')
e = jinja2.Environment(loader=loader)
t = e.get_template('tmpl')
print(t.render(nom='Toto!', some_list=['elmt1', 'elmt2']))
```

Thank you.
