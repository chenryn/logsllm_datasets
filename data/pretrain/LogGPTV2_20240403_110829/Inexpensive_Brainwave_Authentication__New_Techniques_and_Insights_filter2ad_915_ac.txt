following also the recommendation that the participant pool
should be as large as practicable. Our ﬁnal pool size, 52 users,
is bigger than that used in previous works with consumer-
grade EEG readers, which implies more reliable results. Re-
sults on small datasets can be over-optimistic due to chance in
the selected participants, but statistical conﬁdence increases
with more users and samples. We experimentally observed10
that as the participant pool size increases, the variance of
error estimates decreases. For example, when testing the
N400:Faces for 5 users, we got an average EER=9.23% and
standard deviation σ=7.7%, observing EERs as low as 2%.
But the error stabilizes as the number of participants grow,
getting to an average EER=14.38% and σ=0.72 at 40 subjects.
We therefore contribute to understanding the uniqueness of
brainwaves at a larger scale, with higher conﬁdence. One of
the main open challenges that follows from here is scaling up
to bigger populations, given that the minimum sample size
recommended to test for a FAR of 1:100000 is 300000 sam-
ples. As a ﬁrst step towards real prototypes, our results and
discussion show practicality and can help inform the design
of future authentication systems.
6 Usability
This section describes the user study conducted to evaluate
usability aspects, reporting quantitative and qualitative results.
6.1 User Study Design and Methods
Design. Each person taking part in the overall authentication
experiment was asked to ﬁll out a usability questionnaire that
includes three categories of questions. First, we explore the
perceived usability of the ﬁve authentication tasks asking if
they are boring, require attention, and are appealing to re-
peatability on a daily basis. These questions are taken from
Chuang’s et al. work [20], though we ask for ratings on a
5-point Likert scale to allow for more granularity in the re-
sponses. Second, also on a 5-point Likert scale, we question
about device usability, considering two dimensions: ability
to set up the device and overall usage experience. Third, we
target acceptance. Inspired by the work of Payne et al. [57]
on the acceptance of tokens as authenticators, we include
two open-ended questions about potential problems (Q1) and
suggestions for improvement (Q2) of the brainwave authenti-
cation concept. Note that users do not evaluate a prototype but
the proposed authentication tasks and the perception of how
an hypothetical brainwave-based system built on these tasks
would work for them in daily life. The nature of the study
is therefore exploratory and oriented to inform prototype de-
sign, whose evaluation would require further testing.Thus,
we cannot use the Standard Usability Scale (SUS) [16] and
other well-established usability metrics (speed , error rate)
105 random selections of subjects for each participant pool size tested
applied in authentication research [22, 64], as they are only
appropriate for testing prototypes with (at least) moderate
functionality.
Analysis. Usability questions elicited responses on Likert
scales that we analyzed with the Friedman test for omnibus
comparisons. Post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests were conducted with a Bonferroni correction applied, to
determine which authentication tasks differed signiﬁcantly.
As for the open-ended questions on user acceptance, we ana-
lyzed the responses following an iterative, inductive coding
approach [46]. One member of the research team read re-
sponses and created the codebook with thematic codes (see
Appendix 8), and a second researcher independently coded
the full set of data. The inter-coder reliability for the ﬁnal
codes was satisfactory for both questions: excellent agree-
ment for Q1 (Cohen’s kappa=0.91) and substantial for Q2
(Cohen’s kappa=0.76). The cases where the coders differed
in their ﬁnal codes were discussed and reconciled.
6.2 Results
All 56 subjects replied to the Likert-ranked questions about
the usability of authentication tasks and device. With regard
to the open-ended questions, 28 subjects named potential
problems, and 45 reported improvement suggestions for a
brainwave authentication system. Here we analyze these data,
providing representative user quotes when meaningful.
6.2.1 Perceived Usability
Usability of the Authentication Tasks. The graphs in Fig. 5
show participants’ answers about tasks’ usability. Answers to
“boring” and “required attention” were coded from Strongly
Agree (SA)=1 to Strongly Disagree (SD)=5, and answers to
“Repeatability”, from SD=1 to SA=5. Therefore, higher values
always indicate more positive evaluations.
Analyzing the responses regarding boredom, proto-
cols were rated differently (χ2(4)=108.864, p<.05). More
speciﬁcally, there were statistically signiﬁcant differences
(p<.01) in all cases except between the P300:Assigned and
P300:Selected, and the N400:Sentences and N400:Faces. The
N400:Words protocol received the lowest grades with a me-
dian rating of 3 (µ=2.95, σ=1.21). With slightly better grades,
the P300:Selected (µ=3.46, σ=1) and P300:Assigned (µ=3.39,
σ=0.93), received a median of 3 and present no statistically
signiﬁcant differences. At the other extreme, the N400:Faces
protocol (µ=3.78 , σ=0.99), and the N400:Sentences (µ=3.71
, σ=0.97), with the same median rating of 4 and no statisti-
cally signiﬁcant difference, got the best evaluations. About
the latter, one of its positive aspects is that the sentences were
unexpected and sometimes funny, which makes the task more
engaging, as this participant put it in the open-ended answers:
“I like the idea with incongruent sentences. Gener-
ally, I think that it is important to include something

(a) Heatmap
Figure 4: Fig. (a) shows the heatmap of selected features for the GNB classiﬁcation algorithm across ﬁve brainwave authentication
tasks. Frequency features are calculated as the Power Spectrum of the user ERP signal in segments (S1-S5) of 200ms for the
α, β, and γ bands. The time features are 10 Autoregressive Coefﬁcients of the ERP. Features are obtained at 14 measurement
channels, whose corresponding electrode positions in the scalp are depicted in Fig. (b). CMS/DRL are reference electrodes.

funny or encouraging to avoid boredom”. (P28)
When it comes to required attention, tasks were also rated
differently (χ2(4)=158.501, p<.05). Statistically signiﬁcant
differences (p<.01) appear in all cases except between the
P300 protocols and the pair N400:Faces-N400:Words. The
protocols with lower grades are the P300:Assigned (µ=2.5,
σ=1.09) and the P300:Selected (µ=2.57, σ=1.13), both with a
median of 2 and no statistically signiﬁcant differences. Partic-
ipants rated the attention demand of the N400:Sentences task
(µ=2.85, σ=1.03) slightly better, with a median of 3. But the

and N400:Words (µ=3.77, σ=0.76), both with a median of 4
and no statistically signiﬁcant differences.
The responses regarding envisioned daily usage show
differences too (χ2(4)=62.254, p<.05), but they exhibit a
smaller variance compared to the prior questions. In this case,
N400:Faces (µ=3.09, σ=1.27), with a median of 3, is the task
for which most subjects reported to “strongly agree” that they
would like to perform it on a day-to-day basis. In turn, the
N400:Words (µ=2.61, σ=1.3) got the worst evaluation, with
a median of 2. The rest of the authentication tasks fall in the
middle. Statistically signiﬁcant differences (p<.01) appear in
all cases except between the P300 protocols, and between
P300 and N400:Sentences.
Finally, when we asked participants to rank the authentica-
tion tasks, the most enjoyable protocol was the N400 Faces,
chosen by 36% (20) of the respondents. At the other end of
the rank, the N400:Sentences task was selected as the least
enjoyable by 30% (17) of the participants. Overall, image-
based tasks are preferred over text-based ones, as it was also
recalled by several participants in the open-ended questions:
“Picture recognition is better than text recognition".
(P22)
Usability of the EEG Device. Most of the participants
(62.5%) think they will be able to put on the headset by them-
selves, while only a 21.5% (12) reported that they do not
imagine themselves completing the device setup. A plausible
reason for this 21.5% could be that the headset setup required
several minutes in some cases, where the hair density between
the electrodes and the skin was thick. Nevertheless, the ex-
perience using the headset was mostly rated positive, with
a 59% (33) of participants agreeing or strongly agreeing to
this perception and no reported strong disagreements. These
results indicate that authentication using the EPOC+ headset
could be accepted (positive experience) but the usability of
the device can still improve.
6.2.2 Attitudes towards Acceptance
Problems. Participants identiﬁed issues related to the brain-
waves (28%), the device (22%), and the overall authentication
system (50%). First, users reported concerns about the unique-
ness of brainwaves and their stability against e.g., emotional
inﬂuences due to stress or illness. They were also worried that
familiarization with the stimuli would result in weaker brain-
wave responses and lead to authentication errors. Besides, one
subject wondered if not being fully attentive, or as he/she put
it “having meandering thoughts", would affect authentication.
Second, the negative points about the device were the cost,
its design, and the complex setup process. Similarly, users
highlighted the technical problems, such as the imprecision
of the sensors. Third, participants criticized aspects of the
system as a whole, specially its performance (authentication
speed), usability, and the level of security and privacy pro-
vided. As illustrated by the following sample answers, users
are worried about the strength of this type of authentication
against attacks (even mind manipulation) and about the usage
of brainwaves to infer sensitive personal information.
“Skepticism of the user regarding data security and
other aspects which could be ﬁgured out about the
users, which the user does not want.". (P9)
“Changing of individual opinion due to presented
stimuli, e.g., in particular politicians". (P41)
In the usability category, the inclusiveness of the brainwave
authentication system was the most frequent topic. Partici-
pants remarked that using sentences as stimuli would not
work to authenticate children and that the system might not
be usable for people with different cognitive abilities.
Suggestions for improving. Participants reported ideas
that fall in three categories: device improvements (18%), pro-
tocol improvements (39%), and system improvements (42%).
Regarding the device, users pointed to different designs that
blend more naturally with everyday life, such as integrating
EEG readers within headphones or hats. Another frequent
comment was the need to reduce the number of electrodes
and make the device simpler and easy to handle. Regarding
the improvement of protocols, subjects expressed a preference
for visual stimuli vs textual stimuli and call for authentica-
tion tasks that are enjoyable or “cool”. As alternative tasks,
for example, two participants mentioned that they “would
be interested in authentication using music or tones". In the
last category of suggestions, targeting the overall system, per-
formance was the most frequent concern. Users suggest to
“Keep the authentication process as short as possible”, because
otherwise “one sees the repeated, three second long typing
of a password as less annoying than performing one of these
[brainwave authentication] tasks as a whole”. The effort, as
stated by one of the respondents “needs to be adapted to the
required security level”.
7 Discussion
Here we report lessons learned when designing protocols for
brainwave authentication, report security considerations, and
discuss practical implementation aspects and limitations.
7.1 Protocol Design
Design Effort. We argued in Section 5 that one potential
reason inﬂuencing the performance and comparability of
the authentication protocols was the different available num-
ber of samples for training the models, which, in our study,
was affected by the protocol design effort. The number of
epochs usable for classiﬁcation is limited by the total num-
ber of target stimuli, i.e., those that generate an ERP, pre-
sented during the experiment. As summarized in Table 3,

Table 3: Design aspects of brainwave acquisition protocols
a Rounded
b Plus the duration of the preceding priming video (24s in our experiment)
both the N400:Sentences and N400:Faces have less total stim-
uli in comparison to their counterparts. There are two rea-
sons for this: highest elicitation effort (more time required
for stimuli presentation) and low stimuli reusability. While
it is rather quick to present new stimuli in the N400:Words,
N400:Faces, and P300 protocols, that was not possible in
the N400:Sentences. In this case, the subjects ﬁrst had to be
primed on the congruent form of a sentence and then later on
shown the incongruent version to obtain the desired ERP in
response. This process takes about 14 seconds per sentence in
total, which results in a smaller number of stimuli per minute.
Furthermore, the incongruent sentences need to be altered
each time, otherwise they would not appear incongruent to
the users anymore after a small number of iterations. Sim-
ilarly, the N400:Faces also suffers from this effect, i.e., an
unknown face would not lead to the same reaction if it was
shown repeatedly. Because of the lack of stimuli reusability,
we limited the execution of these protocols to just one round
in our experimental setting, with the consequential decrease in
the number of samples. In the N400:Words protocol, a video
and the associated words can be used several times, since only
the interaction between the words and the video are impor-
tant. But the best design case is that of the P300 protocols.
Here, the stimuli can be endlessly reused because the brain
reaction responds to an infrequent event, the oddball, but it
is not related to the semantic processing and so unaltered by
stimulus familiarity.
Overall Protocol Comparison. We provide a comparative
summary of the analyzed protocols to inform the design of
future brainwave authentication systems (see Table 4).
Considering classiﬁcation performance, the N400:Faces
task is the best option. This performance, combined with
the highest usability scores of all tested tasks, makes it a
suitable candidate for real-world implementations. The main
negative aspect is the complexity of the protocol design. Thus,
research towards facilitating this design process is desirable.
The second best option in terms of accuracy are the remaining
N400 protocols. In this group, the N400:Words shows better
potential for applicability, given its higher usability results
