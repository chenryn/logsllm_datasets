1 INTRODUCTION
Domain names remain a major facilitator of cyberattacks. Malicious
actors continuously deploy domains in their cybercriminal oper-
ations, such as spam, phishing, malware distribution and botnet
C&C. Due to this crucial role in cybercriminal operations, stopping
malicious domain names has become a highly important security
objective.
The most well-known countermeasure for malicious domains
is a blacklist. So-called reputation providers curate lists of domain
names that are associated with internet-based attacks. Various soft-
ware and services consult these blacklists and block incoming or
outgoing communication with listed domains accordingly. Black-
lists have become more agile and nowadays domain names are
blocked quickly after exhibiting attacking behavior.
In response, miscreants have adopted hit-and-run strategies.
They counter the short usable lifespan of their domain names
by registering batches of disposable “burner domains” to sustain
their malicious operations, resulting in large-scale registration cam-
paigns. [10, 22]. Therefore, post-factum detection, such as by black-
lists, is becoming limited in its effects [13].
This situation expresses the need to block malicious domain
registrations before they are able to execute any attacking behavior.
Hence, more recent security research aims to shift to earlier detec-
tion of malicious domain names. In a ground-breaking paper, Hao
et al. [9] proposed to predict the maliciousness of domain names
at the time of registration, using a set of 22 manually crafted fea-
tures derived from data available at registration time and a Convex
Polytope Machine (CPM) classifier.
Subsequent work by Vissers et al. [22], showed that in the .eu
top level domain (TLD), approximately 80% of malicious domain
registration campaigns are registered by maximum 20 actors, indi-
vidually using very different modi operandi. This could also explain
why the detection accuracy reported by Hao et al. [9] for the .net
TLD (61%) differs significantly from the .com TLD (70%) at the same
FPR: Different TLDs will likely have different sets of malicious ac-
tors, with different operational characteristics, yielding different
detection results. Moreover, the actual operational deployment of
such a detection system in a real and live environment drastically
changes this ecosystem, as malicious actors actively adapt their
strategies.
In this paper, we propose, implement and thoroughly evaluate
Premadoma, a security system for DNS registries that is able to
detect malicious domains at registration time. We advance the state-
of-the-art as set by Predator [9] by incorporating the registrant data,
which has not been done before and by using a combination of clus-
tering for making similarity-based predictions, as well as traditional
machine learning classification for performing reputation-based
classification. Finally, we strongly focus on real-world operational
aspects, since Premadoma has effectively been deployed at the .eu
ccTLD.
1.1 Strategy
The general goal of the Premadoma system is to reduce the amount
of cybercriminal operations by detecting and preventing malicious
domains at registration time. By applying an automated and adap-
tive mitigation strategy based on insights of the malicious domain
ecosystem, Premadoma aims to substantially increase the cost
for attackers and disincentivize malicious actors from launching
campaigns.
1.1.1 Economic disincentivization. The registration of domain names
for malicious purposes has a cost beyond the pure cost of the domain
name registration: Malicious actors must provide valid-looking, in
some cases functional (or at least consistent) registrant information,
including a phone number, e-mail address and street address . A real
phone number is not free and can potentially be traced back to
a perpetrator, but even providing a false phone number incurs a
certain cost to generate lists of valid looking phone numbers, yet
which do not carry any similarity. Most public e-mail providers
have infrastructure in place to prevent automated account creation.
Some registries perform an address check, to ensure street addresses
