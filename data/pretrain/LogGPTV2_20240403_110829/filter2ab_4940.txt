ATT&CK ID:S1016
ATT&CK Technique Name:MacMa
MacMa installs a com.apple.softwareupdate.plist file in the /LaunchAgents folder with the RunAtLoad value set to true. Upon user login, MacMa is executed from /var/root/.local/softwareupdate with root privileges. Some variations also include the LimitLoadToSessionType key with the value Aqua, ensuring the MacMa only runs when there is a logged in GUI user.[21][22]
