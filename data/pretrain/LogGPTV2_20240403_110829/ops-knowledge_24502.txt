User: I want to make a Python script that automates the process of setting up a VPN server in Windows XP, but the only way I know how to do it is using the Windows GUI dialogs. How would I go about figuring out what those dialogs are doing to the system and designing a Python script to automate it?
Assistant: PyAutoGUI can be installed with pip from PyPI. It's cross platform and can control the mouse & keyboard. It has the features of pywinauto and a few more on top. It can't identify windows or GUI controls, but it does have basic screenshot & image recognition features to click on particular buttons. And it's well-documented and maintained.
pip install pyautogui
