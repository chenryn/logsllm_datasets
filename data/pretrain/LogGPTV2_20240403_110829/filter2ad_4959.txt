To remedy this,
Intrusion detection is an area of increasing concern
in the Internet community. In response to this, many
automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) have been
developed, e.g., commercial (Real Secure) and public
domain (SNORT). However, there is no standardized
way for IDS to communicate with each other or to a
common manager.
the Intrusion
Detection Working Group (IDWG) was chartered under
the auspices of the Internet Engineering Task Force. 
IDWG has published its specifications for a standard
alert format (IDMEF) and a standard transport protocol
(IDXP).Such

IDXP is appropriate as a transport protocol.
The forum will begin with a quick overview of
IDMEF and IDXP standards. This introduction will be
followed bye presentations from implementers and
vendors discussing their experience with both IDMEF
and IDXP; focusing on the reference implementation of

a IDMEF−based IDS manager, and related commercial
activities.
