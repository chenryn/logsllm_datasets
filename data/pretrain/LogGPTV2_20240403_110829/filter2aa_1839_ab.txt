# Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) and RfCat: An In-Depth Analysis

## FHSS Characteristics
- **Channel Hops**: The number of distinct channel hops can range from 50 to a million or more before the pattern repeats.
- **Synchronization**: Devices must be able to synchronize with an existing cell or partner, or they can act as their own master.
- **Channel Spacing and Dwell Time**: Devices must know the channel spacing and the dwell time (the time spent on each channel).
- **Reverse Engineering**: Often, it is necessary to reverse engineer the target device to understand its hopping pattern.
- **Hardware Requirements**: Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) requires specialized hardware.

### Military Applications
- **Security**: Military applications are highly secure due to the use of synchronized Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) for channel selection.

## Ad-hoc FHSS Multi-Node Networks
- **Synchronization**: Nodes must synchronize within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Limited Channels**: The repeated pattern typically uses a limited number of channels.
- **Node Communication**: Each node knows how to communicate with the cell.
- **Pattern Determination**: By tapping the SPI bus, one can determine the hopping pattern. The hop pattern generation algorithm is often based on the CELL ID, and obtaining one pattern can provide access to the entire cell. Some nodes generate unique patterns, and some synchronization information is freely given by the cell.

## FHSS Summary
- **Versatility**: FHSS comes in different forms for various uses and users.
- **Interference Tolerance**: FHSS is naturally tolerant to interference and allows higher power transmission compared to non-FHSS communications.
- **Reversing Challenge**: Determining the FHSS pattern, timing, and appropriate sync method for proprietary communications can be a significant challenge.
- **NIC Configuration**: Configuring a Network Interface Card (NIC) to utilize the obtained knowledge has been very difficult.

## Introduction to RfCat
- **RfCat Overview**: RfCat is a Chipcon-based attack toolset that provides interactive Python access to modulation.
- **Discovery Tools**: Other characteristics were discovered using a Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), Baudline, and custom tools (thanks to Mike Ossman).

## Discovery Process
1. **Initial Capture**: A Spectrum Analyzer (IMME/hedyattack) was used to validate the frequency range.
2. **Logic Analyzer**: A Saleae logic analyzer was used to tap debugging lines.
3. **Transmission Capture**: A USRP (or FunCube) captured the transmission.
4. **Baudline Analysis**: The packet capture was analyzed in Baudline to identify baud rate, modulation scheme, and bit structure.
5. **GnuRadio Companion**: Mike Ossman processed the capture through GnuRadio Companion.
6. **RF Parameters Confirmation**: RF parameters were confirmed through RF analysis and real-life capture.

## Discovery Reloaded
- **RF Parameters**: RF parameters were input into an RfCat dongle, and a subclass of RFNIC was created in Python for the new RF configuration.
- **Discover Mode**: The system was dropped into discover mode to ensure the modem was correctly configured.
- **Normal NIC Mode**: Returned to normal NIC mode to receive real packets.
- **Protocol Reversal**: The next step is to reverse the bi-directional protocol of the pump.

## Power Meters and Security
- **Legal Caution**: Unauthorized tampering with power systems is illegal.
- **Proprietary Networks**: Most power meters use their own proprietary "Neighborhood Area Network" (NAN), typically in the 900MHz range, and sometimes 2.4GHz or licensed spectrum.
- **FHSS Implementation**: To achieve better reception and interference tolerance, all power meters implement FHSS, taking advantage of Title 47: Part 15 power allowances.
- **Common Chips**: Many power meters use cc1111, cc1110, or cc1101 radio cores.

## Vendor Collaboration
- **Vendor Support**: Some vendors support security research, while others do not.
- **Anonymous Support**: The gear used in this presentation was provided by a vendor who understands the importance of security but requested anonymity.
- **Security Commitment**: This vendor's security team is committed to improving the security of their products.

## Smart Meter Complexity
- **Complexity**: Power meters are more complex than glucometers due to their proprietary FHSS in a multiple-access topology and the need to endure RF abuse in large metropolises.
- **MAC Sync and Registration**: Complex MAC synchronization and network registration are required.
- **Initial Analysis**: Initial analysis was performed using a Saleae Logic Analyzer and SpecAn code on IMME and hedyattack dongles.

## Approach
- **SPI Bus Sniffing**: Determine the RF configuration and hopping pattern through SPI bus sniffing.
- **Discover Mode**: Disable the sync-word so the radio sends unaligned bits, then look for the preamble (0xaa or 0x55) and determine possible dwords.
- **Bit Inversion**: Analyze unexpected bit derivations, such as bit inversion.

## New Developments
- **Patents**: Vendors have filed numerous patents related to hopping pattern calculations and communication parameters.
- **Further Research**: There is plenty of work to be done, and researchers are encouraged to get involved.

## Conclusions
- **RfCat Discover Mode**: RfCat discover mode is a powerful tool.
- **Foundation for Attacks**: RfCat serves as a foundation for building attack tools.
- **Security Responsibility**: It is our responsibility to ensure that devices use appropriate security measures.
