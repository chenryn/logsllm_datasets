Docs says "The array can either be a regular Array or a Typed Array.", but
unless I use a typed array I get the following error:
    glDrawArrays: attempt to access out of range vertices in attribute 0
Is this a bug? It's convenient to be able to use regular arrays because then
the buffer is expanded as needed when you use `BufferGeometry.merge`.
Otherwise I'll have to precalculate the final vertex count or convert the
regular array in BufferAttribute to a typedarray somehow.
