User: I'm writing a C application that makes use of Python's AST API to transform Python code expressions before emitting bytecode. I've been a longtime POSIX developer (currently OS X), but I wish learn how to port my projects to Windows as well.
I'm using the static libraries (.lib) generated by build.bat in Python's PCBuild directory. The trouble with these libraries is they somehow skip over the symbols in Python/Python-ast.c as well as Python/asdl.c. I need these APIs for their AST constructors, but I'm not sure how to get Visual Studio to export them.
Do I need to add __declspec(dllexport) for static libraries? 
EDIT: I do not have this problem with static libraries generated on POSIX platforms
Assistant: OK, I figured it out
I was using VS 2013 while Python's build system was designed for VS 2010.
I ended up retargeting everything for 2013 (including a small modification to the tix makefile) and it compiled with all non-static symbols (AST and all) as expected.
Python.org's official pre-built Windows libraries still seem to omit the AST symbols. I don't mind building Python from source myself, but I think the official builds should package the whole shebang.
