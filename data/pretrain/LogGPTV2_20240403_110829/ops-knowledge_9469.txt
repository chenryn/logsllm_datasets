I am developing a C application that leverages Python's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) API to transform Python code expressions before generating bytecode. As a long-time POSIX developer, primarily on macOS, I am now interested in porting my projects to Windows as well.

For this purpose, I have been using the static libraries (`.lib` files) generated by the `build.bat` script located in Python's `PCBuild` directory. However, these libraries seem to be missing the symbols from `Python/Python-ast.c` and `Python/asdl.c`, which are essential for the AST constructors. I am uncertain how to configure Visual Studio to export these symbols.

Do I need to use `__declspec(dllexport)` for static libraries?

**Update:**

I have resolved the issue. The problem stemmed from using Visual Studio 2013, while Python's build system was designed for Visual Studio 2010. After retargeting the project for Visual Studio 2013 and making a minor adjustment to the Tix makefile, the compilation process included all necessary non-static symbols, including those for the AST.

It is worth noting that the official pre-built Windows libraries available from Python.org still omit the AST symbols. While I am comfortable building Python from source, it would be beneficial if the official builds included the complete set of symbols.
