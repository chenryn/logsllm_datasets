### Aggregate Upload Resources and User Demand
To align the aggregated upload resources with the collective user demand, it is important to understand that even if the same users are assigned different hash identifiers due to factors such as DHCP or major software updates, this does not impact our analysis. Our focus is on maintaining hash consistency during a single session, rather than across multiple sessions.

### Download Bandwidth Measurement
Since media players do not report their upload bandwidths to the servers, the trace records lack explicit information about client upload capacities. However, the Windows Media Server measures the download bandwidth from the server to the client when a connection is established. The distribution of these measured download bandwidths is shown in Figure 3. Note that the server does not differentiate between download speeds greater than 3.5 Mbps, leading to a vertical line in the graph for all measurements above this threshold.

### Mapping Download and Upload Bandwidths
Table 1 provides a mapping between download and upload bandwidths based on typical DSL and Cable offerings. Using this table and the measured upload bandwidths, we can infer the upload bandwidth for each user, identified either by ID or hash. This method also allows us to estimate the distribution of user types accessing MSN Video. Over 50% of MSN Video users have residential broadband connections, and 37% have download rates exceeding 3.5 Mbps.

| Download | Upload | Share (%) |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Modem ISDN | 256 kbps | 256 kbps | 4.3% |
| 64 kbps | 64 kbps | 2.8% |
| DSL1 | 768 kbps | 128 kbps | 14.3% |
| DSL2 | 1500 kbps | 384 kbps | 23.3% |
| Cable | 3000 kbps | 768/384 kbps | 18.0% |
| Ethernet | > 3000 kbps | 768 kbps | 37.3% |

**Table 1: User Bandwidth Breakdown (kbps)**

### Conservative Assumptions
Our assumptions about users' upload bandwidth are conservative. For example, many users with download speeds over 3.5 Mbps likely have much higher upload speeds, especially on university and corporate networks. A peer-assisted VoD system may not fully utilize the available bandwidth of high-capacity users to avoid deterring their participation.

### Incentives for Peer-Assisted Delivery
The success of a peer-assisted delivery system depends on users' willingness to share their upload bandwidth. Incentives can be built into the delivery mechanism, as in BitTorrent, or provided through other means. Content providers might offer users options, such as choosing not to act as peers and receiving content directly from a server at lower quality, or opting for peer assistance and getting higher quality. Providers can also offer premium content for free or reduce advertisements to encourage participation. Additionally, dynamic incentives, such as Microsoft Points, can be used to promote more sharing during peak hours.

### Aggregate User Demand and Upload Resources
Using a heuristic to estimate user upload bandwidth, we can determine the aggregate upload bandwidth and demand at any given time. Figure 4 shows the aggregate demand and upload capacity over a 24-hour period on April 18, the day with the highest traffic. As expected, demand fluctuates throughout the day, but the significant margin by which total upload resources exceed user demand suggests that a peer-assisted VoD solution could perform well.

### User Interactivity
When streaming a video, users may not watch it continuously from start to finish. They may quit, pause, resume, skip segments, or fast-forward. Understanding this interactivity is crucial for designing peer-assisted VoD solutions. Figure 5(a) shows the percentage of sessions viewing more than 60%, 80%, or 100% of videos of different lengths. Users generally view a large fraction of short videos but less than 20% of long videos. Figure 5(b) shows the percentage of sessions without interactivity, indicating that a large fraction of users view videos without interruptions, especially for shorter videos.

### Service Evolution
VoD over the Internet is evolving rapidly. In 2006, major players like YouTube, Google Video, and MSN served tens of thousands of videos. Figure 6 shows the bit rate distribution for MSN requested videos in April and December 2006, indicating a 50% increase in bit rate over nine months. This trend suggests that video bit rates will continue to increase faster than average peer upload bandwidths, making it crucial to design peer-assisted VoD systems carefully.

### Traffic Growth
Table 2 shows the significant increase in traffic served by MSN Video servers over the period, partly due to service quality upgrades and increased user engagement.

| Metric | April | December | Increase (%) |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|
| Total Requests | 41.1 M | 64.7 M | 57.4% |
| Unique Users | 9.03 M | 12.02 M | 33.1% |

**Table 2: Traffic Evolution**

### 95 Percentile Rule
ISPs and CDNs typically use the 95 percentile rule to bill customers for bandwidth usage. This rule charges the service provider based on the 95th percentile of the monthly bandwidth measurements, excluding unusually high usage periods. Specifically, the 95th percentile value is the smallest number greater than 95% of the measured values.
