User:  Why is container orchestration needed? What are the commonly used container orchestration tools?
Assistant: The main purpose of container orchestration is to simplify and automate the deployment, configuration, upgrade and scaling of containerized applications. With the rapid development of container technology, the number and scale of containers are also increasing. It is becoming more and more difficult and inefficient to manage these containers manually. Therefore, it is necessary to use container orchestration tools to automatically manage and schedule containers. Commonly used container orchestration tools include: 1. Kubernetes: A widely used, open source container orchestration platform that can automate the management and scheduling of large-scale container applications. 2. Docker Swarm: Another container orchestration tool officially provided by Docker for automatic management and expansion of Docker container applications. 3. Apache Mesos: An open source distributed system kernel for managing cluster resources and running distributed applications, including containerized applications. 4. HashiCorp Nomad: A lightweight, flexible container orchestration platform that automates the management and scheduling of Docker, Java, and other types of container applications. 5. Amazon ECS: The container orchestration service provided by Amazon is used to automate the management and expansion of Docker container applications and can run on the AWS cloud. 6. OpenShift: An open source container application platform developed by Red Hat, based on Kubernetes, for automated management and scheduling of container applications.
