  * Electron version: PI:EMAIL
  * Operating system: MAC OS X Yosemite 10.10.5
I have this sample setup:
    const BrowserWindow = electron.BrowserWindow;
    // ... rest of electron boilerplate
    function createMainWindow() {
        const win = new electron.BrowserWindow({
            width: 600,
            height: 400
        });
        win.on('blur', blurHandler);
        win.on('focus', blurHandler);
        win.loadURL(`file://${__dirname}/index.html`);
        win.on('closed', onClosed);
        return win;
    }
    function blurHandler() {
        let focusedWindow = BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow();
        if (focusedWindow) {
            console.log('There is a focused window!');
        } else {
            console.log('no focused window. :(');
        }
    }
The above code simply calls `blurHandler()` on the `blur` and `focus` events.
**The expected behavior:** is to get the console output of "`There is a
focused window!`" when I click back (to get focus) on the only Electron
window, and to get the output of "`no focused window. :(`" when I click on any
other application windows, or otherwise trigger the `blur` event on the
electron window.
**The actual behavior:** No matter the method of gaining focus on the electron
window I can never get the `BrowserWindow.getFocusedWindow()` method to return
anything except `undefined`. My log just looks like this:
    no focused window. :(
    no focused window. :(
    no focused window. :(
    no focused window. :(
    no focused window. :(
    no focused window. :(
Can anyone see what I am doing wrong here, or have I found a bug?
