title:blackhat:us-21 Demystify AI Security Products With a Universal Pluggable XAI Translator
In the past years, we witnessed a dramatic rise in the platforms and apps based on machine learning and artificial intelligence. Inevitably, nearly every security product claims to be powered by deep learning technology and achieve an incredible detection rate. Confused by the various fancy terms advertised by security companies, the dilemma faced by customers is how to determine the quality of these products and how to choose the suitable one. Previous studies have proposed various ways to evaluate many kinds of ML-based security products (e.g malware detection, cloud-based, endpoint av). Our presentation tends to bridge the research‐to‐practice gap by sharing our experience when evaluating the real-world vendor's products.
