### Description
While working on implementing custom task notes I wanted to test my changes
with Dynamic Task mapping, but we don't have any example DAGs for this.  
We should add an example DAG containing this.
### Use case/motivation
For showing our users how this functionality can be used and also to improve
testability for new features.
