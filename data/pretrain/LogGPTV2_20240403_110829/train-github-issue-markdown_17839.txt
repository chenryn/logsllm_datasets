### Description
While developing custom task notes, I needed to test my changes using Dynamic Task Mapping. However, we currently lack example Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that utilize this feature. It would be beneficial to add an example DAG that demonstrates the use of Dynamic Task Mapping.

### Use Case/Motivation
Adding an example DAG with Dynamic Task Mapping will serve two primary purposes:
1. **User Education:** It will help our users understand how to implement and use this functionality in their own workflows.
2. **Improved Testability:** It will enhance the testing process for new features, ensuring that they integrate seamlessly with Dynamic Task Mapping.
