User: I'm trying to use the Memcache Viewer in the App Engine Dev Console to view keys in a specific namespace. The obvious syntax of namespace.key is not working; I haven't been able to find documentation describing specific usage. Is this possible?
Assistant: Not possible. In dev, check namespace'd memcache items programmatically, e.g. using a handler.
