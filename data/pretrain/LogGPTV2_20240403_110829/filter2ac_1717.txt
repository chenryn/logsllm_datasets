title:blackhat:asia-21 The B-MAD Approach to Threat Modeling
Threat modeling is a family of techniques for discovering what can go wrong with a system and improve its security. Threat modeling techniques often aim to be structured, systematic and comprehensive and have to intersect with the organization's systems for delivering products.In many ways, threat modeling is very easy, as long as you avoid the many traps that await the unwary. This talk is about one particular set of traps in the way that threat modeling is deployed across an organization.The B-MAD approach to threat modeling is an anti-pattern for threat modeling. It starts with the words "Bring me a diagram" and ends with escalations between security and operations, security and development, and security and the world. Why is that? How can we predict that it's all going to go downhill from those 4 little words? Why do they make up an anti-pattern?
