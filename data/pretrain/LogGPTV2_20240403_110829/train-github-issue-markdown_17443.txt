I'm trying to display placeholder value in a Select if value is not selected.
When user selects value it should disappear and the value should replace
placeholder. However label should be displayed all the time. I can achieve it
in TextField but not in Select.
Here is my try however it doesn't display anything in placeholder.
    const errorObj = mapError(props);
        return (
            {props.label}
            } {...props as any} >
                {props.children}
            {errorObj.helperText && {errorObj.helperText}}
        )
