### Current Behavior

When route parameters at the parent level change, the child-level resolver is called to resolve new data. However, the route data observers are not notified that the data has changed. 

This issue was initially addressed in #12942, but the actual use case remains unresolved. I did not test the fix because the initial feedback indicated that the issue would not be fixed. Consequently, I modified my routing configuration to avoid this problem. Now, as I attempt to refactor the resulting complex routing setup, I find that the issue persists.

### Expected Behavior

Route observers should be notified with the newly resolved data.

### Minimal Reproduction with Instructions

To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: [resolve-issue](https://github.com/slubowsky/resolve-issue)
2. Run the application using `ng serve`.
3. Click on the provided links to navigate through the app.
4. Observe that the resolver is called every time you navigate, regardless of whether the parent or child parameter changes. A message "FooResolve ..." will be logged to the console.
5. Notice that the component subscribed to the route data is only notified (as evidenced by the console messages) when the child parameter changes.

### Motivation for Changing the Behavior

Resolving data without notifying the components is ineffective and does not serve the intended purpose.
