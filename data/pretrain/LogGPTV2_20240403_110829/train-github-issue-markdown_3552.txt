**Current behavior**  
Route params at parent level change, child level resolver is called to resolve
new data, but route data observers are not notified that data has changed.  
See #12942 where this issue as initially titled was fixed but the actual use
case is still broken (I never tested the fix as the initial feedback was that
the issue wasn't going to be fixed so prior to the fix landing I had already
changed my routing to avoid this issue. Now attempting to refactor the
resulting strange routing configuration and finding that the issue is still
there)
**Expected behavior**  
Route observers would be given the newly resolved data
**Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions**
See https://github.com/slubowsky/resolve-issue  
Run the app (ng serve). Click on the links to navigate. Resolver is called
every navigation regardless of whether parent or child param changes and a
message is logged to the console "FooResolve ..."
Component which has subscribed for route data is only notified (as evidenced
by the console messages) when the child param changes.
**What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**  
Having resolver re-resolve the data without letting the components know is
kind of useless...
