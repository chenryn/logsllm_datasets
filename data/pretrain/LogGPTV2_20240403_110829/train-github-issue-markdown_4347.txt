This is a bit of a nitpick, but I think this would improve user-friendlyness.  
Currently `np.asarray([[1, 2], [2, 3, 4]], dtype=np.float)` yields "setting an
array element with a sequence."
I think it would be more helpful if it yielded something like "Can't create
array from lists. Column length %d of column %d doesn't match column length
%d."
I imagine the error bubbles up from somewhere deep in the code and makes
perfect sense where it is raised. It is just something that comes up a lot,
and a more friendly and / or informative message could be helpful. So maybe we
could catch it further up and include more information if possible.
