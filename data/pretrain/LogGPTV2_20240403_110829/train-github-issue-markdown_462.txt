When sending OPTION requests along with token requests, Internet Explorer 11 and earlier versions encountered an issue where the request header could not be found. Various methods were attempted to resolve this problem, such as reducing browser script blocking, using `es6-promise`, and incorporating `babel-polyfill`. However, these solutions did not work for IE, while all other browsers functioned normally. We would appreciate your assistance in identifying the root cause of this issue.

Thank you.
