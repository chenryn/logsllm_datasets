When sending OPTION requests with token requests, IE11 and below said that the
list could not find the request header. They tried various methods, such as
reducing the browser blocking script, using es6-primise, using babel-polyfill.
All browsers except IE browser were normal, and asked for your help. Look at
the reason. Thank you.
