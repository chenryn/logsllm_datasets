Tensoring with identity (on either side) corresponds to applying 𝐴 to certain “slices” of
the input vector, giving a simple and efﬁcient parallel algorithm for multiplying by a tensor
with the identity matrix.
A useful fact about the Kronecker product which we use frequently is called the mixed-
product property: (𝐴 ⊗ 𝐵) · (𝐶 ⊗ 𝐷) = 𝐴𝐶 ⊗ 𝐵𝐷 (when we can form the matrix products
𝐴𝐶 and 𝐵𝐷).
2.1.1
Integers
Euler’s Totient Function We frequently need Euler’s totient function 𝜙(𝑛), which counts
the number of integers that are both less than 𝑛 and coprime with 𝑛. 𝜙(1) = 1, and for a
prime power 𝑝𝑒 with 𝑒 ≥ 1, 𝜙(𝑝𝑒) = (𝑝 − 1)𝑝𝑒−1. For an arbitrary positive integer 𝑚 with
𝑖 ), i.e., the totient function is

multiplicative.
Modular Arithmetic. As usual, Z denotes the ring of integers, and the quotient ring
∼= Z/(𝑞Z) is the ring of integers modulo 𝑝, i.e., the cosets 𝑥 + 𝑞Z with the usual addition
Z𝑞
and multiplication operations.
Rounding. For integers 𝑞 ≥ 𝑝 ≥ 2, we deﬁne the rounding function ⌊·⌉ : Z𝑞 → Z𝑝
by ⌊𝑥⌉𝑝 = ⌊(𝑝/𝑞) · ¯𝑥⌋, where ¯𝑥 ∈ Z ≡ 𝑥 mod 𝑞. We extend this function to vectors
component-wise.

Chinese Remainder Theorem. The Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) gives an isomor-
phism between Z𝑞1·𝑞2 and the ring product Z𝑞1 × Z𝑞2 when 𝑞1 and 𝑞2 are coprime. In fact,
the CRT holds in a more general setting, which we will also need (see below).
2.1.2 Lattices
In cyclotomic ring-based lattice cryptography, we use the space 𝐻 ⊆ C𝑛 for some even
integer 𝑛, deﬁned as
𝐻 := {x = (𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) ∈ C𝑛 : 𝑥𝑖 = 𝑥𝑖+𝑛/2, 𝑖 ∈ {1, . . . , 𝑛/2}}.
It is easy to check that 𝐻, with the inner product ⟨x, y⟩ =∑︀
𝑖 𝑥𝑖𝑦𝑖 of the ambient space C𝑛,
is an 𝑛-dimensional real inner product space, i.e., it is isomorphic to R𝑛 via an appropriate
rotation. Therefore, the reader may mentally replace 𝐻 with R𝑛 in all that follows. We let
ℬ = {x ∈ 𝐻 : ‖x‖ ≤ 1} denote the closed unit ball in 𝐻 (in the Euclidean norm).
For the purposes of this work, a lattice ℒ is discrete additive subgroup of 𝐻 that is full
rank, i.e., spanR(ℒ) = 𝐻. A lattice is generated as the set of integer linear combinations of
some linearly independent basis vectors B = {b1, . . . , b𝑛}:
{︁∑︁
𝑧𝑖b𝑖 : 𝑧𝑖 ∈ Z}︁
.
ℒ = ℒ(B) :=
𝑖
The volume (or determinant) of a lattice ℒ is vol(ℒ) := vol(𝐻/ℒ) = |det(B)|, where B
denotes any basis of ℒ. The minimum distance of ℒ is 𝜆1(ℒ) := min0̸=v∈ℒ‖v‖, the length
of a shortest nonzero lattice vector. The dual lattice ℒ∨ of a lattice ℒ is the set of all points
in 𝐻 having integer inner products with every vector of the lattice: ℒ∨ := {w ∈ 𝐻 :
⟨w,ℒ⟩ ⊆ Z}.
14
2.1.3 Gaussians.
The Gaussian function 𝜌 : 𝐻 → R+ is deﬁned as 𝜌(x) := exp(−𝜋‖x‖2), and is scaled to
have parameter (or width) 𝑟 > 0 by deﬁning 𝜌𝑟(x) := 𝜌(x/𝑟). The (spherical) Gaussian
probability distribution 𝐷𝑟 over 𝐻 is deﬁned to have probability density function 𝑟−𝑛 · 𝜌𝑟.
(We usually omit the subscript when 𝑟 = 1.)
The following bounds use the function
√
𝑓 (𝑥) =
2𝜋𝑒 · 𝑥 · exp(−𝜋𝑥2),
(2.1.1)

which is strictly decreasing and at most 1 for 𝑥 ≥ 1/

𝑛 ln( 1
𝜀 ) + 1
The following is an immediate corollary of Lemma 2.1.1 and [MR07, Lemma 4.1].

Introduction

Polynomial Rings. For a ring 𝑅 and indeterminate 𝑋, a polynomial ring 𝑅[𝑋] is the set
𝑖=0 𝑎𝑖 · 𝑋 𝑖, where each 𝑎𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 and 𝑋 is an indeterminate.
For example, 3𝑋 2 − 5𝑋 + 1 ∈ Z[𝑋]. As with the integers, we can take quotients of the
form 𝑅[𝑋]/(𝑓 (𝑋)) where 𝑓 (𝑋) ∈ 𝑅[𝑋] and (𝑓 (𝑋)) = 𝑓 (𝑋) · 𝑅[𝑋] is the ideal generated
by 𝑓 (𝑋). Continuing our example, we set 𝑓 (𝑋) = 𝑋 2 + 2 so that 3𝑋 2 − 5𝑋 + 1 =
3(𝑋 2 + 2) − 5𝑋 − 5 ∼= −5𝑥 − 5 ∈ Z[𝑋]/(𝑋 2 + 2). In particular, if 𝑓 (𝑋) has degree 𝑛,
the quotient is a polynomial of degree < 𝑛.
Basic Cyclotomic Rings. For a positive integer 𝑚, let 𝑅 = Z[𝜁𝑚] denote the 𝑚th cyclo-
tomic ring, where 𝜁𝑚 is an abstract element of multiplicative order 𝑚, i.e., 𝜁 𝑚
𝑚 = 1 and
𝑚 ̸= 1 for all positive 𝑗 < 𝑚. For example, the ﬁrst cyclotomic ring is 𝒪1 = Z. The
𝜁 𝑗
parameter 𝑚 is known as the index or conductor of the cyclotomic ring. For a positive integer
𝑞, we frequently use the quotient ring 𝑅𝑞 = 𝑅/𝑞𝑅 = Z𝑞[𝜁𝑚], i.e., the 𝑚th cyclotomic over
base ring Z𝑞. As with the integers, we can represent 𝑅𝑞1·𝑞2 as a ring product 𝑅𝑞1 × 𝑅𝑞2, with
component-wise operations, via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. (Note that we also use the
Chinese Remainder Theorem on the factorization of 𝑝𝑅 into prime ideals below. These two
uses are independent, but we refer to their combined use as “double CRT” representation.)
The 𝑚th cyclotomic ring is the ring of algebraic integers of (and therefore contained
in) the 𝑚th cyclotomic number ﬁeld 𝐾 = Q(𝜁𝑚), the ring extension of the rationals Q
obtained by adjoining an element 𝜁𝑚. The minimal polynomial Φ𝑚(𝑋) (over the rationals)
of 𝜁𝑚 is called the 𝑚th cyclotomic polynomial. This polynomial has degree 𝑛 = 𝜙(𝑚), so
deg(𝐾/Q) = deg(𝑅/Z) = 𝑛.
We may also view 𝐾 (respectively, 𝑅, 𝑅𝑞) as a polynomial ring via the isomorphism
Q(𝜁𝑚) ∼= Q[𝑋]/(Φ𝑚(𝑋)) (resp. Z[𝜁𝑚] ∼= Z[𝑋]/(Φ𝑚(𝑋)), Z𝑞[𝜁𝑚] ∼= Z𝑞[𝑋]/(Φ𝑚(𝑋)), by
16
identifying 𝜁𝑝 with 𝑋. In particular, this means we write may cyclotomic ring elements as a
vector of coefﬁcients with respect to some ﬁxed basis, e.g., the standard polynomial basis
{1, 𝑋, 𝑋 2, . . .}. That is, an element of 𝐾 (respectively, 𝑅, 𝑅𝑞) can be uniquely represented
as a rational (resp., integral, 𝑍𝑞) polynomial in 𝑋 of degree less than 𝑛.
Cyclotomic Heierarchy. The 𝑚th cyclotomic ring 𝑅 = Z[𝜁𝑚] can be seen as a subring
of the 𝑚′th cyclotomic ring 𝑅′ = Z[𝜁𝑚′] if and only if 𝑚|𝑚′, and in such a case we can
embed 𝑅 into 𝑅′ by identifying 𝜁𝑚 with 𝜁 𝑚′/𝑚
. The dimension of the ring extension 𝑅/𝑅′
is dim(𝑅/𝑅′) = 𝜙(𝑚)/𝜙(𝑚′).
𝑚′
The trace function Tr𝑅′/𝑅 : 𝑅′ → 𝑅 is the 𝑅-linear function deﬁned as follows: ﬁxing
any 𝑅-basis of 𝑅′, multiplication by an 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅′ can be represented as a matrix 𝑀𝑥 over 𝑅
with respect to the basis, which acts on the multiplicand’s vector of 𝑅-coefﬁcients. Then
Tr𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥) is simply the trace of 𝑀𝑥, i.e., the sum of its diagonal entries. (This is invariant
under the choice of basis.) Because 𝑅′/𝑅 is Galois, the trace can also be deﬁned as the sum
of the automorphisms of 𝑅′ that ﬁx 𝑅 pointwise. All of this extends to the ﬁeld of fractions
of 𝑅′ (i.e., its ambient number ﬁeld) in the same way.
Notice that the trace does not ﬁx 𝑅 (except when 𝑅′ = 𝑅), but rather Tr𝑅′/𝑅(𝑥) =
deg(𝑅′/𝑅) · 𝑥 for all 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅. For a tower 𝑅′′/𝑅′/𝑅 of ring extensions, the trace satisﬁes the
composition property
Tr𝑅′′/𝑅 = Tr𝑅′/𝑅 ∘ Tr𝑅′′/𝑅′ .
2.2.2 Tensor Product of Rings
Let 𝑅, 𝑆 be arbitrary rings with common subring 𝐸 ⊆ 𝑅, 𝑆. The ring tensor product of 𝑅
and 𝑆 over 𝐸, denoted 𝑅 ⊗𝐸 𝑆, is the set of 𝐸-linear combinations of pure tensors 𝑟 ⊗ 𝑠
17
for 𝑟 ∈ 𝑅, 𝑠 ∈ 𝑆, with ring operations deﬁned by 𝐸-bilinearity, i.e.,
(𝑟1 ⊗ 𝑠) + (𝑟2 ⊗ 𝑠) = (𝑟1 + 𝑟2) ⊗ 𝑠
(𝑟 ⊗ 𝑠1) + (𝑟 ⊗ 𝑠2) = 𝑟 ⊗ (𝑠1 + 𝑠2)
𝑒(𝑟 ⊗ 𝑠) = (𝑒𝑟) ⊗ 𝑠 = 𝑟 ⊗ (𝑒𝑠)
for any 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸, and the mixed-product property
(𝑟1 ⊗ 𝑠1) · (𝑟2 ⊗ 𝑠2) = (𝑟1𝑟2) ⊗ (𝑠1𝑠2).
We need the following facts about tensor products of cyclotomic rings. Let 𝑅 = 𝒪𝑚1
and 𝑆 = 𝒪𝑚2. Their largest common subring and smallest common extension ring (called
the compositum) are, respectively,
𝐸 = 𝒪𝑚1 ∩ 𝒪𝑚2 = 𝒪gcd(𝑚1,𝑚2)
𝑇 = 𝒪𝑚1 + 𝒪𝑚2 = 𝒪lcm(𝑚1,𝑚2).
Moreover, the ring tensor product 𝑅⊗𝐸 𝑆 is isomorphic to 𝑇 , via the 𝐸-linear map deﬁned by
∼= 𝒪𝑚1𝑚2.
sending 𝑟⊗𝑠 to 𝑟·𝑠 ∈ 𝑇 . In particular, for coprime 𝑚1, 𝑚2, we have 𝒪𝑚1⊗Z𝒪𝑚2
2.2.3 Powerful Basis
Prime cyclotomics. For a prime 𝑝, the 𝑝th cyclotomic ring is 𝒪𝑝 = Z[𝜁𝑝], where 𝜁𝑝 denotes
a primitive 𝑝th root of unity, i.e., 𝜁𝑝 has multiplicative order 𝑝. The minimal polynomial
over Z of 𝜁𝑝 is Φ𝑝(𝑋) = 1 + 𝑋 + 𝑋 2 + ··· + 𝑋 𝑝−1, so 𝒪𝑝 has degree 𝜙(𝑝) = 𝑝 − 1 over Z,
∼= Z[𝑋]/(Φ𝑝(𝑋)) by identifying 𝜁𝑝 with 𝑋. The
and we have the ring isomorphism 𝒪𝑝
18
power basis ⃗𝑝𝑝 of 𝒪𝑝 is the Z-basis consisting of the ﬁrst 𝑝 − 1 powers of 𝜁𝑝, i.e.,
⃗𝑝𝑝 := (1, 𝜁𝑝, 𝜁 2
𝑝 , . . . , 𝜁 𝑝−2
𝑝
).
For example, the 5th cyclotomic polynomial is 1 + 𝑋 + 𝑋 2 + 𝑋 3, and the 5th cyclotomic
ring is isomorphic to Z[𝑋]/(1 + 𝑋 + 𝑋 2 + 𝑋 3). The power basis for 𝒪5 is (1, 𝜁5, 𝜁 2
5 ).
5 , 𝜁 3
Prime-power cyclotomics. Now let 𝑚 = 𝑝𝑒 for 𝑒 ≥ 2 be a power of a prime 𝑝. Then we
can inductively deﬁne 𝒪𝑚 = 𝒪𝑚/𝑝[𝜁𝑚], where 𝜁𝑚 denotes a primitive 𝑝th root of 𝜁𝑚/𝑝. Its
minimal polynomial over 𝒪𝑚/𝑝 is 𝑋 𝑝 − 𝜁𝑚/𝑝, so 𝒪𝑚 has degree 𝑝 over 𝒪𝑚/𝑝, and hence
has degree 𝜙(𝑚) = (𝑝 − 1)𝑝𝑒−1 over Z.
The above naturally yields the relative power basis of the extension 𝒪𝑚/𝒪𝑚/𝑝, which is
the 𝒪𝑚/𝑝-basis
⃗𝑝𝑚,𝑚/𝑝 := (1, 𝜁𝑚, . . . , 𝜁 𝑝−1
𝑚 ).
More generally, for any powers 𝑚, 𝑚′ of 𝑝 where 𝑚|𝑚′, we deﬁne the relative power basis
⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 of 𝒪𝑚′/𝒪𝑚 to be the 𝒪𝑚-basis obtained as the Kronecker product of the relative
power bases for each level of the tower:
⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 := ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚′/𝑝 ⊗ ⃗𝑝𝑚′/𝑝,𝑚′/𝑝2 ⊗ ··· ⊗ ⃗𝑝𝑚𝑝,𝑚.
(2.2.1)
𝑚′
for 𝑝𝑖 ≤ 𝑚′, the relative power basis ⃗𝑝𝑚′,𝑚 consists of
Notice that because 𝜁𝑝𝑖 = 𝜁 𝑚′/𝑝𝑖
all the powers 0, . . . , 𝜙(𝑚′)/𝜙(𝑚) − 1 of 𝜁𝑚′, but in “base-𝑝 digit-reversed” order (which
turns out to be more convenient for implementation). Finally, we also deﬁne ⃗𝑝𝑚 := ⃗𝑝𝑚,1
and simply call it the powerful basis of 𝒪𝑚.
Of special interest are the two-power cyclotomic rings, which have especially simple
representations and are widely used in practical instantiations of lattice cryptography. When
𝑚 = 2𝑘 ≥ 2 is a power of two, the 𝑚th cyclotomic polynomial is Φ𝑚(𝑋) = 𝑋 𝑛 + 1,
where 𝑛 = 𝜙(𝑚) = 2𝑘−1. Thus the 8th cyclotomic ﬁeld is 𝐾 = Q[𝑋]/(𝑋 4 + 1) and the
19
corresponding ring is 𝑅 = Z[𝑋]/(𝑋 4 + 1). For this special case, the power basis is identical
to the powerful basis ⃗𝑝 and the “tweaked” decoding basis 𝑡 · ⃗𝑑 of 𝑅 as deﬁned below.
Arbitrary cyclotomics. Now let 𝑚 be any positive integer, and let 𝑚 =∏︀𝑡
ℓ=1 𝑚ℓ be its
factorization into maximal prime-power divisors 𝑚ℓ (in some canonical order). Then we
can deﬁne
𝒪𝑚 := Z[𝜁𝑚1, 𝜁𝑚2, . . . , 𝜁𝑚𝑡].1
It is known that the rings Z[𝜁ℓ] are linearly disjoint over Z, i.e., for any Z-bases of the
individual rings, their Kronecker product is a Z-basis of 𝒪𝑚. In particular, the powerful
basis of 𝒪𝑚 is deﬁned as the Kronecker product of the component powerful bases:
