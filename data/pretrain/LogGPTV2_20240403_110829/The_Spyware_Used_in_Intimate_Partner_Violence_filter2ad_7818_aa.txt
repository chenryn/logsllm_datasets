## Abstract
Survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) increasingly report that abusers use spyware to track their location, monitor communications, and cause emotional and physical harm. Despite this, there has been limited research into the spyware used in intimate partner surveillance (IPS). This study provides the first in-depth analysis of the IPS spyware ecosystem. We designed, implemented, and evaluated a measurement pipeline that combines web and app store crawling with machine learning to identify and label potentially dangerous apps in IPS contexts. Our findings reveal several hundred such apps, including both overt spyware and "dual-use" apps, which have legitimate purposes but can be repurposed for spying. We document the availability of online resources that educate abusers on exploiting these apps and show how some developers encourage IPS through advertisements, blogs, and customer support. Additionally, we analyze existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools, which fail to identify dual-use apps as threats.

## 1. Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects approximately one-third of all women and one-sixth of all men in the United States [54]. Digital technologies are increasingly being exploited by abusers to exert control over their victims. Among the most concerning tools are spyware apps, which abusers install on survivors' phones to surreptitiously monitor their communications, location, and other data. Survivors [23, 29, 46], professionals who assist them [29, 58], and the media [9, 22, 37] report that spyware is a growing threat to the security and safety of IPV survivors. In extreme cases, IPS can lead to physical confrontation, violence, and even murder [10, 18].

The definition of "spyware" is often ambiguous. Some apps, like FlexiSpy [2] and mSpy [6], are explicitly marketed for covert monitoring. However, other seemingly benign apps, such as family tracking or "Find My Friends" apps [8, 29, 58], are also being exploited by abusers for IPS. We term these "dual-use" apps, as they are designed for legitimate use cases but can be repurposed for IPS due to their functionality, which allows remote access to a device's sensors or data without the user's knowledge. Both overt spyware and dual-use apps pose significant risks in IPV contexts.

This paper presents the first detailed measurement study of mobile apps that can be used for IPS. Our results highlight the ease with which abusers can find and use these apps, and we discuss potential directions for future work to address this issue.

### Finding IPS Spyware
We hypothesize that abusers typically find spyware by searching the web or app stores, such as Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store. To test this, we conducted a semi-manual crawl of Google search results using a set of terms (e.g., "track my girlfriend's phone without them knowing"). We collected Google's suggested similar searches to seed further queries, resulting in over 27,000 URLs. These searches revealed a variety of resources, including blogs, how-to guides, and news articles about spyware. We identified 23 functional apps not available on official app stores and numerous links to apps on official stores.

To systematically identify IPS-relevant apps, we designed, built, and evaluated a crawling pipeline for Google Play, the official Android app marketplace. Our pipeline gathers a large list of potential IPV-related search terms using search recommendations from the Play Store. We then collect the top fifty apps returned for each term. Over a one-month period, this approach retrieved more than 10,000 apps, though many were irrelevant (e.g., game cheat codes).

Given the large dataset, manual investigation was impractical, so we developed a pruning algorithm using supervised machine learning trained on 1,000 hand-labeled apps to filter out irrelevant apps based on their descriptions and requested permissions. On a separate set of 200 manually labeled test apps, our classifier achieved a false positive rate of 8% and a false negative rate of 6%. While this accuracy is insufficient for a standalone detection tool due to the safety risks of false negatives, it suffices for our measurement study. We discuss potential improvements, such as incorporating manual review and initial experiments with crowdsourcing to scale manual review.

We also performed a smaller study using our measurement pipeline with Apple’s App Store, yielding qualitatively similar results. See Appendix B for details.

### The IPS Landscape
Our corpus of apps is extensive, with hundreds of Google Play applications capable of facilitating IPS. We manually investigated a representative subset of 61 on-store and 9 off-store apps by installing them on research phones, analyzing their features and user interfaces, and observing their marketing. We categorized the apps into three broad types: personal tracking (e.g., find-my-phone apps), mutual tracking (e.g., family tracking apps), and subordinate tracking (e.g., child monitoring apps).

All three types of apps can be dangerous in an IPS context. The most harmful allow covert monitoring of all communications, remote activation of cameras and microphones, and location tracking. Two on-store apps, Cerberus and TrackView, violate Play Store policy by hiding their app icon and showing no notifications, making them as covert as off-store spyware. (We reported these apps to Google for review; see our disclosures below.) All 70 apps are straightforward to install and configure, making them easy for abusers to use.

Some off-store apps, such as HelloSpy, overtly advertise themselves for use in IPS. For example, HelloSpy's website depicts a man physically assaulting a woman, with text discussing the importance of tracking one's partner (see Figure 1). On-store apps generally do not promote IPS, but further investigation revealed that some vendors advertise or condone IPS as a use case. We found that vendors advertise on IPS-related search terms such as "how to catch cheating girlfriend" on both Google and the Play Store. We also uncovered networks of IPS-focused websites that link exclusively to specific app webpages and directly advertise IPS use cases.

For a subset of 11 apps (6 on-store and 5 off-store), we contacted customer service representatives posing as potential abusers. When asked, "If I use your app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?" 8 out of 11 responded with affirmative explanations implicitly condoning IPS. Only one (an off-store app) admonished against IPS use, and two did not respond.

### Performance of Anti-Spyware Tools
The existence of many easy-to-use, powerful apps for IPS highlights the need for effective detection and cleanup tools. Various tools, including those from major anti-virus vendors like Symantec, Kaspersky, and Avast, claim to detect spyware. However, no one has evaluated these tools specifically for detecting IPS spyware or dual-use apps. We evaluated anti-spyware tools against a corpus of 280 on-store apps detected by our Google Play crawl (manually verified to be usable for IPS) and all 23 off-store spyware apps we identified.

No anti-spyware tool effectively detects IPS-relevant apps. The best-performing tool, Anti Spy Mobile, flagged 95% of off-store spyware but only 47% of on-store IPS-relevant apps. It also had a high false positive rate of 12%, labeling applications like Google Chrome and the Play Store as spyware. Major anti-virus systems were among the worst performers for dual-use apps, flagging at most 13% of on-store apps. While this may be appropriate in other contexts, for IPV victims, these tools are too conservative. They perform better with off-store spyware but still miss some dangerous apps.

### Summary and Next Steps
This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of applications usable for IPS. Key findings include:

- **Measurement Approaches:** We introduced methods for discovering apps easily found by abusers via web and app store searches. These apps pose immediate and dangerous threats to victims.
- **Role of Dual-Use Apps:** We highlighted the role of dual-use apps in IPS, showing that they are often as powerful as overt spyware. On-store apps can achieve prohibited capabilities due to a lack of OS-level protections.
- **Marketing and Customer Support:** Many apps brand themselves for "legitimate" purposes but simultaneously pay for IPS-related advertisements. A small study revealed that some customer service representatives condone IPS.
- **Ineffectiveness of Detection Tools:** Existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools are ineffective at detecting and remediating IPS spyware.

While our study has limitations (see Section III-D), it uncovers the prevalence of apps that can facilitate IPS, leading to significant emotional, psychological, and physical harm for victims.

We disclosed our results to Google, and they have taken steps to improve user safety. Google reviewed the apps we discovered and took action against those violating Play Store policies due to a lack of persistent notifications or promotion of spyware or stealth tracking. Additionally, Google is expanding restrictions on serving advertisements for IPV-related queries. We hope our results will motivate the computer security community to work towards improving survivor safety. We conclude with an initial discussion on next steps, including dealing with the complexities of dual-use apps, improving detection tools for IPV settings, suggesting ways honest developers can prevent exploitation of their tools for IPS, and modifying laws or regulations to better help survivors.

## 2. Background: Spyware in IPV
Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes physical, sexual, stalking, or psychological harm by a current or former intimate partner or spouse. Studies [23, 29, 40, 58] indicate that abusers increasingly exploit technology to monitor and control their partners, which can be a form of abuse and can facilitate other forms of abuse (physical, emotional, sexual, etc.).

Much of the IPV literature discusses the installation of IPS apps on survivors' mobile devices [23, 28, 29, 40, 46, 58]. One study [46] interviewed 15 IPV survivors in the United States, finding that 20% reported being monitored by spyware. An analysis of data stolen from two spyware vendors, FlexiSpy and Retina-X, revealed that 130,000 people use these tools, with most usage for IPS [22]. Interviews with survivors and professionals indicate that abusers can easily find spyware via web search and that many otherwise innocuous apps, such as "Find my phone" and child trackers, are repurposed for spying on intimate partners [23, 29, 40, 53, 58].

Spyware or other apps that facilitate surveillance are particularly dangerous in IPV situations because abusers often have physical access to their partner's devices and can know, guess, or compel disclosure of access credentials (passwords, PIN codes, or swipe patterns) [29, 46, 58]. This enables the abuser to install spyware via app stores or, in the case of Android, configure the phone to allow installation of non-app-store apps. Installation does not require sophisticated technical knowledge, and easy-to-follow installation guides are readily available. All the spyware we encountered can be used without rooting the phone, though additional spying features may be available if the phone is rooted.

### Types of IPS Apps
Our focus is on apps that abusers purposefully install to stalk, monitor, and control an intimate partner's device without consent. There are two main classes of spyware: dual-use apps, such as "Find my phone," which can be deployed as spyware despite not being designed for such use, and overt spyware like FlexiSpy and Retina-X, which are designed and advertised for covert surveillance.

We use the term "IPS-relevant apps" to refer to apps that abusers may install for surveillance. This category includes both overt spyware and dual-use apps. Specifically, we consider as IPS-relevant apps those:
1. Whose primary purpose is giving another person the ability to collect data, track location, and/or remotely control a device.
2. Which function, after initial installation and configuration, without the current user's interaction.
3. That the victim likely does not want on the device.

This means we generally do not consider apps like Google Maps, as their primary purpose is not to enable location tracking by another person, and many victims want them installed. Such apps have safety and privacy implications in IPV, but their analysis and remediation require different approaches.

### Other Forms of Malware
We do not consider adware (sometimes called commercial spyware) or other potentially unwanted programs (PUPs) that help companies collect information on user behavior. The ecosystem of PUPs has been analyzed in [38, 56]. We also do not specifically consider advanced malware, such as those used by governments or remote access trojans (RATs) [25, 39, 43], which generally require more technical sophistication to deploy for IPS. Prior studies have measured and detected more commercially-motivated malware that steals users' secrets (e.g., bank details) [12, 14, 26, 34, 60, 62]. While some spyware or anti-spyware apps might double as malware, we found no evidence of intention by vendors to do so. These other forms of unwanted software carry privacy risks in IPV contexts but require different techniques for study and remediation.

### Open Questions
Despite indications that spyware is widely used in IPV, there has been no in-depth study of the technologies available to abusers. Our work aims to answer several critical questions:
- How easy is it to find apps usable for IPS? How many such apps are available?
- Can we find and categorize the kinds of dual-use apps that abusers use?
- What capabilities are available to abusers?
- Are app developers encouraging IPS?
- Are there effective tools (e.g., anti-spyware) for detecting and removing such apps?

## 3. Finding IPS-Relevant Apps
In this section, we describe our measurements to discover apps usable for IPS. We focus on apps that an abuser, assumed to be of average technical sophistication, could locate and deploy. We ignore apps that are difficult to locate (e.g., advertised in closed forums) or difficult to deploy (e.g., require rooting a phone). Instead, we look at apps that can be readily found by searching popular search engines or app stores.
