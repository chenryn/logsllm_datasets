Abstract—Survivors of intimate partner violence increasingly
report that abusers install spyware on devices to track their
location, monitor communications, and cause emotional and
physical harm. To date there has been only cursory investigation
into the spyware used in such intimate partner surveillance (IPS).
We provide the ﬁrst in-depth study of the IPS spyware ecosystem.
We design, implement, and evaluate a measurement pipeline that
combines web and app store crawling with machine learning to
ﬁnd and label apps that are potentially dangerous in IPS contexts.
Ultimately we identify several hundred such IPS-relevant apps.
While we ﬁnd dozens of overt spyware tools, the majority are
“dual-use” apps — they have a legitimate purpose (e.g., child
safety or anti-theft), but are easily and effectively repurposed
for spying on a partner. We document that a wealth of online
resources are available to educate abusers about exploiting apps
for IPS. We also show how some dual-use app developers are
encouraging their use in IPS via advertisements, blogs, and
customer support services. We analyze existing anti-virus and
anti-spyware tools, which universally fail to identify dual-use
apps as a threat.
I. INTRODUCTION
Intimate partner violence (IPV) affects roughly one-third of
all women and one-sixth of all men in the United States [54].
Increasingly, digital
technologies play a key role in IPV
situations, as abusers exploit them to exert control over their
victims. Among the most alarming tools used in IPS are
spyware apps, which abusers install on survivors’ phones in or-
der to surreptitiously monitor their communications, location,
and other data. IPV survivors [23, 29, 46], the professionals
who assist them [29, 58], and the media [9, 22, 37] report
that spyware is a growing threat to the security and safety
of survivors. In the most extreme cases,
intimate partner
surveillance (IPS) can lead to physical confrontation, violence,
and even murder [10, 18].
The deﬁnition of “spyware” is a murky one. Some apps are
overtly branded for surreptitious monitoring, like FlexiSpy [2]
and mSpy [6]. But survivors and professionals report that
other seemingly benign apps, such as family tracking or “Find
My Friends” apps [8, 29, 58], are being actively exploited by
abusers to perform IPS. We call these dual-use apps: they
are designed for some legitimate use case(s), but can also be
repurposed by an abuser for IPS because their functionality
enables another person remote access to a device’s sensors or
data, without the user of the device’s knowledge. Both overt
spyware and dual-use apps are dangerous in IPV contexts.
We provide the ﬁrst detailed measurement study of mobile
apps usable for IPS. For (potential) victims of IPS, our results
are decidedly depressing. We therefore also discuss a variety
of directions for future work.
Finding IPS spyware. We hypothesize that most abusers ﬁnd
spyware by searching the web or application stores (mainly,
Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store). We therefore
started by performing a semi-manual crawl of Google search
results. We searched for a small set of terms (e.g., “track my
girlfriend’s phone without them knowing”). In addition to the
results, we collected Google’s suggestions for similar searches
to seed further searches. The cumulative results (over 27,000+
returned URLs) reveal a wide variety of resources aimed at
helping people engage in IPS: blogs reviewing different apps,
how-to guides, and news articles about spyware. We found 23
functional apps not available on any ofﬁcial app store, and a
large number of links to apps available on ofﬁcial app stores.
We therefore design, build, and evaluate a crawling pipeline
for Google Play [3], the ofﬁcial app marketplace for Android.
Our pipeline ﬁrst gathers a large list of potential IPV-related
search terms by using search recommendations from Play
Store, as we did with Google search. We then collect the top
ﬁfty apps returned for each of the terms. Over a one-month
period, this approach retrieved more than 10,000 apps, though
many have no potential IPS use (e.g., game cheat codes were
returned for the search term “cheat”).
The data set
is large enough that manual
investigation
is prohibitive, so we build a pruning algorithm that uses
supervised machine learning trained on 1,000 hand-labeled
apps to accurately ﬁlter out
irrelevant apps based on the
app’s description and the permissions requested by the app.
On a separate set of 200 manually labeled test apps, our
classiﬁer achieves a false positive rate of 8% and false negative
rate of 6%. While we do not think this represents sufﬁcient
accuracy for a standalone detection tool given the safety
risks that false negatives represent in this context, it sufﬁces
for our measurement study. We discuss how one might tune
the pipeline to incorporate manual review to achieve higher
accuracy (and no false negatives), as well as initial experiments
with crowdsourcing to scale manual review.
We performed a smaller study using our measurement
pipeline with Apple’s App Store, and got qualitatively similar
results. See Appendix B.
The IPS landscape. The resulting corpus of apps is large,
with hundreds of Play Store applications capable of facilitating
IPS. We manually investigate in detail a representative subset
of 61 on-store and 9 off-store apps by installing them on
research phones, analyzing the features and user interface they

provide, and observing how they are marketed. We uncover
three broad categories of apps: personal tracking (e.g., ﬁnd-
my-phone apps), mutual tracking (e.g., family tracking apps),
and subordinate tracking (e.g., child monitoring apps).
The three types of apps have differing capabilities, though
all can be dangerous in an IPS context. The worst allow
covert monitoring of all communications, remote activation of
cameras and microphones, location tracking, and more. Two
of the on-store apps we analyzed, Cerberus and TrackView,
violate Play Store policy by hiding their app icon and showing
no notiﬁcations, making them as covert as off-store spyware.
(We reported these apps to Google for review, see discussion
about our disclosures below.) All 70 apps are straightforward
to install and conﬁgure, making them easy to use by abusers.
Some off-store apps overtly advertised themselves for use
in IPS. An example is HelloSpy, whose website depicts a
man physically assaulting a woman with surrounding text dis-
cussing the importance of tracking one’s partner, see Figure 1.
Others,
including those on the Play Store, most often do
not have descriptions or webpages promoting IPS. However,
further investigation revealed that a number of these apps
advertised or condoned IPS as a use case. We document that
vendors advertise on IPS-related search terms such as “how
to catch cheating girlfriend” on both Google and Play Store.
We also uncover networks of IPS-focused websites that link
exclusively to a speciﬁc app’s webpage and directly advertise
IPS use cases for the app.
For a subset of 11 apps (6 on-store and 5 off-store),
we contacted customer service representatives posing as a
potential abuser.1 In response to the question “If I use your app
to track my husband will he know that I am tracking him?”,
8 out of 11 responded with afﬁrmative explanations implicitly
condoning IPS. Only one (an off-store app) replied with an
admonishment against use for IPS. Two apps did not respond.
Performance of anti-spyware tools. The existence of so
many easy-to-use, powerful apps usable for IPS demonstrates
that victims need detection and cleanup tools. A variety
of tools advertise their ability to deal with spyware. These
include tools from major anti-virus vendors, such as Symantec,
Kaspersky, and Avast, as well as some lesser-known tools. As
far as we are aware, no one has evaluated any of these tools
for the particular task of detecting IPS spyware or dual-use
apps. We evaluate anti-spyware tools against a corpus of 280
on-store apps detected by our crawl of Google Play (that we
manually veriﬁed to be usable for IPS) and all 23 off-store
spyware apps we identiﬁed.
No anti-spyware tool effectively detects IPS-relevant apps.
The best performing (Anti Spy Mobile) ﬂagged 95% of off-
store spyware, but only 47% of on-store IPS-relevant apps. The
tool also has a prohibitively high false positive rate of 12%,
labeling applications such as Google Chrome and Play Store as
spyware. The major anti-virus systems were some of the worst
performers for dual-use apps (ﬂagging at most 13% of on-

store apps). While this labeling may be appropriate for other
contexts, for IPV victims these tools are far too conservative.
The tools do better detecting off-store spyware, but still fail
to label some dangerous apps.
Summary and next steps. We perform the ﬁrst study of
applications usable for IPS. In particular:
• We introduce measurement approaches for discovering ap-
plications easily found by abusers via searching the web
and app stores. The discovered apps pose immediate and
dangerous threats to victims.
• We highlight the role of dual-use apps in IPS, and show
that they are often as powerful as overt spyware. On-store
apps can achieve prohibited capabilities due to a lack of
OS-level protections.
• We show that many apps brand themselves only for “le-
gitimate” purposes, but simultaneously pay for IPS-related
advertisements. A small measurement study revealed that
some apps’ customer service representatives condone IPS.
• We show that existing anti-virus and anti-spyware tools are
ineffective at detecting and remediating IPS spyware.
While our ﬁrst-of-its-kind study has various limitations (see
Section III-D),
it nevertheless uncovers the prevalence of
apps that can facilitate IPS, and which can lead to immense
emotional, psychological, and physical harm for victims.
We disclosed our results to Google, and they have already
taken steps to improve safety for their users. Google reviewed
the apps we discovered and conﬁrmed that they took action
against some of the apps that violated Play Store policies due
to a lack of persistent notiﬁcations or promotion of spyware
or stealth tracking. In addition, Google is expanding their
restrictions on advertisement serving for IPV-related queries.
We hope our results will motivate the computer security
community more broadly to work to improve survivor safety.
We therefore conclude with an initial discussion about next
steps, including how to: deal with the complexities of dual-
use apps; improve detection tools for use in IPV settings;
suggest ways honest developers can prevent exploitation of
their tools for IPS; and modify laws or regulations to better
help survivors.

II. BACKGROUND: SPYWARE IN IPV
Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes physical or sexual
violence, stalking, or psychological harm by a current or
former intimate partner or spouse. A number of studies [23,29,
40,58] indicate that abusers increasingly exploit technology to
monitor and control their partner in IPV contexts, which can
be a form of abuse in and of itself and can facilitate other
forms of abuse (physical, emotional, sexual, etc.).
Much of the IPV literature discusses the installation of IPS
apps on a survivors’ mobile devices [23, 28, 29, 40, 46, 58].
One study [46] interviewed 15 survivors of IPV in the United
States, and found that 20% reported being monitored by
spyware. An analysis of data stolen from two spyware vendors,
FlexiSpy and Retina-X, revealed that 130,000 people use one
of the tools [22]. The hackers’ investigation concluded that
most usage is for IPS. Interviews of survivors and profession-
als working with them indicate that abusers can easily ﬁnd
spyware via web search, and that many otherwise innocuous
apps, such as “Find my phone” apps and child trackers, are
easily repurposed by abusers for spying on intimate part-
ners [23, 29, 40, 53, 58].
Spyware or other apps that facilitate surveillance are par-
ticularly dangerous in IPV situations because abusers often
have physical access to their partner’s device(s), and can know,
guess, or compel disclosure of access credentials (passwords,
PIN codes, or swipe patterns) [29, 46, 58]. This enables the
abuser to install spyware via an app store such as the Google
Play Store or Apple App Store. In the case of Android, an
abuser can conﬁgure the phone to allow installation of apps
not found on the Play Store. Installation of apps does not
require sophisticated technical knowledge and, as we discuss
in detail later, easy-to-follow installation guides are readily
available. All of the spyware we encountered can be used
without rooting the phone, though in some cases additional
spying features were available should one do so.
Types of IPS apps. Our focus is on apps that abusers
purposefully install in order to stalk, monitor, and control an
intimate partner’s device without their consent. The examples
above indicate two main classes of spyware. We refer to
apps like “Find my phone” as dual-use apps, as they can be
deployed as spyware despite not being purposefully designed
for such use. In contrast, overt spyware like FlexiSpy and
Retina-X are designed and advertised to be surreptitious and
applicable for spying on a target.
We will use the term IPS-relevant apps or IPS apps to
refer to apps that we believe may be purposefully installed
by abusers for surveillance; this category includes both overt
spyware and dual-use apps. In more detail we consider as
IPS-relevant apps those (1) whose primary purpose is giving
another person the ability to collect data, track location, and/or
remotely control a device; (2) which function, after initial
interaction with the
installation and conﬁguration, without
current user of the device; and (3) that
the victim most
likely does not want on the device. This means we will, in
general, not consider apps such as Google Maps: while it can
be conﬁgured to continuously update another person of the
device’s location without interaction with the current user, its
primary purpose is not to enable location tracking by another
person and most victims want it installed. Certainly such apps
have safety and privacy implications in IPV, but, particularly
because victims might desire their continued installation, their
analysis and remediation will require different approaches.
These scoping rules will not always be easy to apply in a
decisive way. When in doubt we conservatively marked apps
as IPS relevant. In most such cases we anyway found anecdotal
evidence online of abusers employing the app or similar ones.
Other forms of malware. We do not consider adware
(sometimes called commercial spyware) or other potentially
unwanted programs (PUPs), that help companies collect in-
formation on user behavior. The ecosystem of PUPs has
been analyzed in [38, 56]. Moreover, we don’t speciﬁcally
consider advanced malware such as those used by governments
or the remote access trojans (RATs) [25, 39, 43] often used
by voyeurs, which generally would require more technical
sophistication on the part of an abuser to deploy for IPS.
Likewise there have been many prior studies measuring and
detecting more commercially-motivated malware that steal
users secrets (e.g., bank details) [12, 14, 26, 34, 60, 62]. While
in theory it could be that some spyware or anti-spyware apps
double as malware that aims to leak conﬁdential information to
third-parties (people other than the abuser), we have found no
evidence of intention2 by vendors to do so. These other forms
of unwanted software certainly carry privacy risks in IPV
contexts as well as elsewhere, but their study and remediation
require different techniques than those we explore here.
Open questions. Despite the many indications that spyware
is widely used in IPV, there has been, to date, no in-depth
study of the technologies available to abusers. Thus, our work
endeavors to answer a number of critical open questions:
• How easy is it to ﬁnd apps usable for IPS? How many such
• Can we ﬁnd and categorize the kinds of dual-use apps that
• What capabilities are available to abusers?
• Are app developers encouraging IPS?
• Are there effective tools (e.g., anti-spyware) for detecting
might be used in IPS?
apps are available?
and removing such apps?
III. FINDING IPS-RELEVANT APPS
In this section, we perform measurements to discover apps
usable for IPS. We focus on the apps that an abuser, assumed to
be of average technical sophistication, could locate and deploy.
To this end, we ignore apps that are difﬁcult to locate (e.g.,
advertised in closed forums) or difﬁcult to deploy (e.g., require
rooting a phone). We instead look at apps that can be readily

third-parties, see Section IV.
