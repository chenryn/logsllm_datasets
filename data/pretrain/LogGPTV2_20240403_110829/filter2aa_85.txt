### Conversation with Gary Webb, May 2000

**Was it worth it?**  
Yes, it was. The CIA admitted to their involvement, and I knew I had uncovered the truth. That conviction kept me going. I was certain that I was right.

I went into this with my eyes wide open, fully aware of the challenges and risks involved. My family, especially my children, suffered as a result. Initially, I believed I had the support of my newspaper, but that support wavered. However, I found encouragement from unexpected sources, particularly from the African American community.

My wife stood by me, even though she was accustomed to receiving death threats due to my work. In life, you get one chance to do the right thing. If you don't seize that opportunity, you surrender, and the wrongdoers win.

The people I was up against are some of the worst in the world. They lie, plant false stories, discredit others, and worse, all as part of their job. They have the resources and experience to make your life miserable. But someone has to stand up to them. Otherwise, they win.

The choice is clear: either do the work or surrender.

Gary was often described as both the most cynical and, in many ways, the most naive and idealistic person. He was mentored by a journalist who taught him that the role of a reporter is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable. When Gary took his own life, I couldn't help but think back to this late-night conversation.

**Who won? Who won?**
