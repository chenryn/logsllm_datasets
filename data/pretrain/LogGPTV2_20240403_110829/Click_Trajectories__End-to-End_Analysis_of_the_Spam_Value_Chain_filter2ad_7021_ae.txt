of programs, such as EvaPharmacy, Pharmacy Express, and
RX Partners, have infrastructure distributed over a large
percentage (50% or more) of registrars and ASes.
To summarize, there are a broad range of registrars and
ISPs who are used to support spam-advertised sites, but there
is only limited amounts of organized sharing and differ-
ent programs appear to use different subsets of available
resource providers.15
B. Realization
Next, we consider several aspects of
the realization
pipeline, including post-order communication, authorization
and settlement of credit card transactions, and order fulﬁll-
ment.
We ﬁrst examined the hypothesis that realization in-
frastructure is the province of afﬁliate programs and not
individual afﬁliates. Thus, we expect to see consistency in
payment processing and fulﬁllment between different in-
stances of the same afﬁliate program or store brand. Indeed,
we found only two exceptions to this pattern and purchases
from different sites appearing to represent the same afﬁliate
program indeed make use of the same merchant bank and
15We did ﬁnd some evidence of clear inter-program sharing in the form
of several large groups of DNS servers willing to authoritatively resolve
collections of EvaPharmacy, Mailien and OEM Soft Store domains for
which they were outside the DNS hierarchy (i.e., the name servers were
never referred by the TLD). This overlap could reﬂect a particular afﬁliate
advertising for multiple distinct programs and sharing resources internally
or it could represent a shared service provider used by distinct afﬁliates.

same pharmaceutical drop shipper.16 Moreover, key cus-
tomer support features including the email templates and
order number formats are consistent across brands belonging
to the same program. This allowed us to further conﬁrm our
understanding that a range of otherwise distinct brands all
belong to the same underlying afﬁliate program, including
most of the replica brands: Ultimate Replica, Diamond
Replicas, Distinction Replica, Luxury Replica, One Replica,
Exquisite Replicas, Prestige Replicas, Aff. Accessories; most
of the herbal brands: MaxGentleman, ManXtenz, Viagrow,
Dr. Maxman, Stud Extreme, VigREX; and the pharmacy:
US HealthCare.17
Having found strong evidence supporting the dominance
of afﬁliate programs over free actors, we now turn to the
question how much realization infrastructure is being shared
across programs.
Payment: The sharing of payment infrastructure is sub-
stantial. Table V documents that, of the 76 purchases for
which we received transaction information, there were only
13 distinct banks acting as Visa acquirers. Moreover, there
is a signiﬁcant concentration even among this small set
of banks. In particular, most herbal and replica purchases
cleared through the same bank in St. Kitts (a by-product of
ZedCash’s dominance of this market, as per the previous
discussion), while most pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs
used two banks (in Azerbaijan and Latvia), and software
was handled entirely by two banks (in Latvia and Russia).
Each payment transaction also includes a standardized
“Merchant Category Code” (MCC) indicating the type of
goods or services being offered [52]. Interestingly, most
afﬁliate program transactions appear to be coded correctly.
16In each of the exceptions, at least one order cleared through a different
bank—perhaps because the afﬁliate program is interleaving payments across
different banks, or (less likely) because the store “brand” has been stolen,
although we are aware of such instances.
17This program, currently called ZedCash, is only open by invitation and
we had little visibility into its internal workings for this paper.

Table VI: List of product suppliers and associated afﬁliate programs and/or store brands.
For example, all of our software purchases (across all
programs) were coded as 5734 (Computer Software Stores)
and 85% of all pharmacy purchases (again across programs)
were coded as 5912 (Drug Stores and Pharmacies). ZedCash
transactions (replica and herbal) are an exception, being
somewhat deceptive, and each was coded as 5969 (Direct
Marketing—Other). The few other exceptions are either
minor transpositions (e.g., 5921 instead of 5912), singleton
instances in which a minor program uses a generic code
(e.g., 5999, 8999) with a bank that we only observed in
one transaction, and ﬁnally Greenline which is the sole
pharmaceutical afﬁliate program that cleared transactions
through a US Bank during our study (completely miscoded
as 5732, Electronic Sales, across multiple purchases). The
latter two cases suggest that some minor programs with less
reliable payment relationships do try to hide the nature of
their transactions, but generally speaking, category coding
is correct. A key reason for this may be the substantial
ﬁnes imposed by Visa on acquirers when miscoded merchant
accounts are discovered “laundering” high-risk goods.
two of
the largest pharmacy programs,
GlavMed and RX–Promotion, we also purchased from
“canonical” instances of their sites advertised on their online
support forums. We veriﬁed that they use the same bank,
order number format, and email
template as the spam-
advertised instances. This evidence undermines the claim,
made by some programs, that spammers have stolen their
templates and they do not allow spam-based advertising.
Finally,
for
Fulﬁllment: Fulﬁllment for physical goods was sourced
from 13 different suppliers (as determined by declared
shipper and packaging), of which eight were again seen
more than once (see Table VI). All pharmaceutical tablets
shipped from India, except for one shipped from within
the United States (from a minor program), while replicas
shipped universally from China. While we received herbal
supplement products from China and New Zealand, most (by
volume) shipped from within the United States. This result
is consistent with our expectation since, unlike the other
442
goods, herbal products have weaker regulatory oversight and
are less likely to counterfeit existing brands and trademarks.
For pharmaceuticals, the style of blister packs, pill shapes,
and lot numbers were all exclusive to an individual nominal
sender and all lot numbers from each nominal sender were
identical. Overall, we ﬁnd that only modest levels of supplier
sharing between pharmaceutical programs (e.g., Pharmacy
Express, Stimul-cash, and Club-ﬁrst all sourced a particular
product from PPW in Chennai, while RX–Promotion and
DrugRevenue both sourced the same drug from Rhine Inc.
in Thane). This analysis is limited since we only ordered a
small number of distinct products and we know (anecdotally)
that pharmaceutical programs use a network of suppliers to
cover different portions of their formulary.
We did not receive enough replicas to make a convincing
analysis, but all ZedCash-originated replicas were low-
quality and appear to be of identical origin. Finally, pur-
chased software instances were bit-for-bit identical between
sites of the same store brand and distinct across different
afﬁliate programs (we found no malware in any of these
images). In general, we did not identify any particularly clear
bottleneck in fulﬁllment and we surmise that suppliers are
likely to be plentiful.
C. Intervention analysis
Finally, we now reconsider these different resources in
the spam monetization pipeline, but this time explicitly from
the standpoint of the defender. In particular, for any given
registered domain used in spam, the defender may choose
to intervene by either blocking its advertising (e.g., ﬁltering
spam), disrupting its click support (e.g., takedowns for name
servers of hosting sites), or interfering with the realization
step (e.g., shutting down merchant accounts).18 But which
of these interventions will have the most impact?
18In each case, it is typically possible to employ either a “takedown”
approach (removing the resource comprehensively) or cheaper “blacklist-
ing” approach at more limited scope (disallowing access to the resource
for a subset of users), but for simplicity we model the interventions in the
takedown style.
Ideally, we believe that such anti-spam interventions need
to be evaluated in terms of two factors: their overhead to
implement and their business impact on the spam value
chain. In turn, this business impact is the sum of both the
replacement cost (to acquire new resources equivalent to the
ones disrupted) and the opportunity cost (revenue forgone
while the resource is being replaced). While, at this point in
time, we are unable to precisely quantify all of these values,
we believe our data illustrates gross differences in scale that
are likely to dominate any remaining factors.
To reason about the effects of these interventions, we
consider the registered domains for the afﬁliate programs
and storefront brands in our study and calculate their relative
volume in our spam feeds (we particularly subtract the botnet
feeds when doing this calculation as their inherent bias
would skew the calculation in favor of certain programs). We
then calculate the fraction of these domain trajectories that
could be completely blocked (if only temporarily) through
a given level of intervention at several resource tiers:
Registrar. Here we examine the effect if individual reg-
istrars were to suspend their domains which are known to
be used in advertising or hosting the sites in our study.
Hosting. We use the same analysis, but instead look at the
number of distinct ASs that would need to be contacted (who
would then need to agree to shut down all associated hosts
in their address space) in order to interrupt a given volume
of spam domain trajectories. We consider both name server
and Web hosting, but in each case there may be multiple
IP addresses recorded providing service for the domain. We
adopt a “worst case” model that all such resources must be
eliminated (i.e., every IP seen hosting a particular domain)
for that domain’s trajectory to be disrupted.
Payments. Here we use the same approach but focused
on the role played by the acquiring banks for each program.
We have not placed purchases via each domain, so we
make the simplifying assumption that bank use will be
consistent across domains belonging to the same brand
or afﬁliate program. Indeed this is strongly borne out in
our measurements. For the two small exceptions identiﬁed
earlier, we assign banks proportionally to our measurements.
Figure 5 plots this data as CDFs of the spam volume in our
feeds that would be disrupted using these approaches. For
both registrars and hosters there are signiﬁcant concentra-
tions among the top few providers and thus takedowns would
seem to be an effective strategy. For example, almost 40%
of spam-advertised domains in our feeds were registered by
NauNet, while a single Romanian provider, Evolva Tele-
com, hosts almost 9% of name servers for spam-advertised
domains and over 10% of the Web servers hosting their
content; in turn, over 60% of these had payments handled
via a single acquirer, Azerigazbank.
these numbers do not
the entire story.
Another key issue is the availability of alternatives and their
switching cost.
However,
tell
For example, while only a small number of individual
IP addresses were used to support spam-advertised sites,
the supply of hosting resources is vast, with thousands of
hosting providers and millions of compromised hosts.19 The
switching cost is also low and new hosts can be provisioned
on demand and for low cost.20
By contrast, the situation with registrars appears more
promising. The supply of registrars is fewer (roughly 900
gTLD registrars are accredited by ICANN as of this writing)
and there is evidence that not all registrars are equally
permissive of spam-based advertising [28]. Moreover, there
have also been individual successful efforts to address
malicious use of domain names, both by registries (e.g.,
CNNIC) and when working with individual registrars (e.g.,
eNom [25]). Unfortunately, these efforts have been slow,
ongoing, and fraught with politics since they require global
cooperation to be effective (only individual registrars or
registries can take these actions). Indeed, in recent work we
have empirically evaluated the efﬁcacy of past registrar-level
interventions and found that spammers show great agility in
working around such actions [29]. Ultimately, the low cost
of a domain name (many can be had for under $1 in bulk)
and ease of switching registrars makes such interventions
difﬁcult.
Finally, it is the banking component of the spam value
chain that is both the least studied and, we believe, the
most critical. Without an effective mechanism to transfer
consumer payments, it would be difﬁcult to ﬁnance the
rest of the spam ecosystem. Moreover, there are only two
networks—Visa and Mastercard—that have the consumer
footprint
in Western countries to reach spam’s principal
customers. While there are thousands of banks, the number
who are willing to knowingly process what the industry
calls “high-risk” transactions is far smaller. This situation
is dramatically reﬂected in Figure 5, which shows that just
three banks provide the payment servicing for over 95% of
the spam-advertised goods in our study.
More importantly, the replacement cost for new banks is
high, both in setup fees and more importantly in time and
overhead. Acquiring a legitimate merchant account directly
with a bank requires coordination with the bank, with the
card association, with a payment processor and typically
involves a great deal of due diligence and delay (several days
19Note, spam hosting statistics can be heavily impacted by the differences
in spam volume produced by different afﬁliates/spammers. For example,
while we ﬁnd that over 80% of all spam received in this study leads to sites
hosted by just 100 distinct IP addresses, there are another 2336 addresses
used to host the remaining 20% of spam-advertised sites, many belonging
to the same afﬁliate programs but advertising with lower volumes of spam
email.
20The cost of compromised proxies is driven by the market price
for compromised hosts via Pay-Per-Install enterprises, which today are
roughly $200/1000 for Western hosts and $5–10/1000 for Asian hosts [49].
Dedicated bulletproof hosting is more expensive, but we have seen prices
as low as $30/month for virtual hosting (up to several hundred dollars for
dedicated hosting).
