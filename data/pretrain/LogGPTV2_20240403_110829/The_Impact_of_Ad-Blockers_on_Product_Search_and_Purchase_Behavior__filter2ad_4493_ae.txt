observe that ad-blockers saved participants time or money
during the experiment (but ad-blockers also do not aim to
positively affect consumer behavior), we did not ﬁnd support
for the claims about an informative role of advertising either.
In other words, we did not ﬁnd empirical evidence that con-
textual online advertising improves or speeds up the matching
of the consumers’ needs with the particular sellers able to sat-
isfy them for a lower price, or that ad-blockers deprived users
of potential shopping advantages, and privacy and security
beneﬁts of blocking ads.
Finally, the use of ad-blockers did not meaningfully alter
consumers’ satisfaction with products, their prices, or per-
ceived quality. However, participants in the Block condition,
where ad-blockers were enabled, reported lower satisfaction
with the perceived web page loading speed. The dissatis-
faction with web page loading speed may or may not have
indirect economic implications on consumer behavior out-
side of lab conditions. For example, customers annoyed by
slow browsing, on the one hand, may abandon shopping ses-
sions before completing the transactions, or they may be less
willing to invest time and effort in comparison shopping and
purchase more expensive products than they would otherwise
do, if they browsed more items. The examination of indirect
impacts of browsing experience on purchasing behavior and
satisfaction is a subject for future ﬁeld work.
Although we did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant results of
the treatment on our main dependent variables, the conﬁdence
intervals from the regressions have valuable practical impli-
cations. First, the conﬁdence interval for the Block condition
coefﬁcient in Table 2 (S4) suggests with 95% conﬁdence that

people in the Block condition, where ad-blocker was enabled,
chose products that are no more than 10% cheaper or more
expensive than the average price in a given category com-
pared to people in the NoBlock condition. In contrast, if we
consider the reported use of ad-blockers outside of the experi-
mental setting, our results imply (as a correlational and not
necessarily causal relationship) that with 95% conﬁdence, the
participants who use ad-blockers on their home computers,
purchase products that either have a similar price or are up to
20% cheaper than products chosen by non-users. 16
Second, the conﬁdence interval for the Block condition
coefﬁcient in Table 3 (S5) suggests with 95% conﬁdence
that people randomized to the Block condition, where the
ad-blocker was enabled, spent between 24 minutes less and
76 minutes longer (with an average of 26 minutes longer) on
product search than participants in the NoBlock condition.
Although this ﬁnding is not statistically signiﬁcant, half an
hour of saved time or 1+ hour of extra time spent on product
search is practically signiﬁcant on an individual level. Given
an average $28 hourly wage,17 that would translate into loss
of up to $35, in the worst case scenario, a loss of $12 on
average, and up to $11 in savings in the best case scenario.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the opportunity costs
for consumers who deploy ad-blockers may be substantial,
although they are not precisely estimated in this study, and
there may even be a decrease in search time. Due to the high
variance in search times across participants and products,
a larger study is needed to determine ad-blocker effects on
search time.
To summarize, while we did not ﬁnd a main treatment effect
of using ad-blockers in the experiment, we observed that par-
ticipants who use ad-blockers on their home computers tended
to choose products on average 10–11% cheaper (p < 0.05)
than people who usually do not use ad-blockers. This ﬁnding
suggests that long-term use of ad-blockers may inﬂuence con-
sumers’ shopping choices, or that individuals who choose to
use ad-blockers endogenously may have different shopping
preferences than those who do not.
6.1 The Effects of Organic and Sponsored
Search Results on Consumer Behavior
We found that, in the control condition where ads were dis-
played, participants who chose products from the top spon-
sored links paid signiﬁcantly higher prices (p = 0.01), and par-
ticipants who chose products from sponsored Google Shop-
ping listings paid, on average, lower, but not signiﬁcantly so
(p = 0.06), prices than people who chose products from or-
ganic links. Moreover, in the control condition, we found that
satisfaction with the products, their prices, and expected qual-
16As this is not experimentally controlled we cannot determine if using
an ad-blocker at home causes participants to select cheaper products or if
price-conscious consumers are more likely to use an ad-blocker at home.
17The average wage in the US in January 2019 is $27.56 [102].
ity measured immediately after the experiment, was lower,
when chosen following the sponsored Google Shopping list-
ings and bottom sponsored links, than when chosen from the
organic links (although these differences did not persist when
we measured again after the product delivery). Therefore, the
welfare implications of being exposed to ads (or blocking
them) may ultimately depend to a signiﬁcant degree on which
ads consumers end up following and purchasing from.
Our ﬁndings reﬂect actual participants’ choices. They do
not imply that prices of products in sponsored search results
are similar to or different from the product prices in organic
search results in general. Even if general differences in prices
across various types of search results are a possible explana-
tion of the observed discrepancy, our study does not aim at
generalizing that claim. The goal of our experiment was not
to speciﬁcally test the difference in all prices across various
types of search results on the Internet, but to examine con-
sumer behavior regarding prices of the products they chose in
two types of online shopping environments—with and with-
out ad-blocking in place. For instance, underlying differences
in prices of the chosen products may or may not attenuate
the effect of ad-blocking on purchasing patterns, depending
on other factors such as individual participants’ character-
istics, low purchase-decision involvement, time pressure, or
low individual price sensitivity, which could have lead people
to pick the most available options without exerting effort on
comparison shopping and price seeking. The general differ-
ence in prices and the investigation of the potential factors
driving that difference are part of our future work plan.
Our observation of higher variance in prices of the chosen
products in certain categories in the Block condition (Table
2) may be another illustration of the indirect effect of treat-
ment on consumer behavior through an “anchoring effect.”
We conjecture that price ads in sponsored Google Shopping
box shown at the top of the search results may have inﬂu-
enced the consumers’ reference price. Similarly, ads could
have anchored participants’ expectations about brand, quality,
or speciﬁc product characteristics (such as model, color, or
ﬂavor of the product) that could have inﬂuenced participants’
subsequent product search. We plan to investigate this phe-
nomenon in more detail and verify the consistency across the
product categories in our future work.
6.2 The Effects of Moderators
We found that participants spent less time on searching prod-
ucts using speciﬁc branded search queries and were less satis-
ﬁed (ex-ante) with the product choices and their prices. One
of the potential explanations is that speciﬁc search queries nar-
rowed down the variations between the products in the search
results, thus saving time due to reduction in dimensions of
comparison shopping. However, limitation of freedom made
participants less happy with the chosen products.
Participants who frequently purchase speciﬁc products,
174    29th USENIX Security Symposium

chose lower-priced items in these categories and were more
satisﬁed with the respective product choices and expected
quality (ex-ante and ex-post). This may be related to loy-
alty effects and reﬂect consumers’ previous experiences with
products [1, 24, 29]. In line with prior research, high prod-
uct involvement made our participants spend more time on
product search and choose higher-priced products, and was
associated with their ex-ante satisfaction with product choices,
prices, and expected quality. Speciﬁcally, the choice of higher-
priced products conﬁrms the previous ﬁndings on the positive
correlation of product-purchase involvement with price ac-
ceptability [39, 69, 112] and satisfaction [39].
In essence, our experiment does not ﬁnd evidence that de-
ployment of ad-blockers against contextual ads, aiming at
protecting users’ privacy and security, and reducing clutter in
the online experience, has detrimental effects on consumers’
welfare, in terms of satisfaction with products, their prices,
perceived quality, or time spent on online searching.
