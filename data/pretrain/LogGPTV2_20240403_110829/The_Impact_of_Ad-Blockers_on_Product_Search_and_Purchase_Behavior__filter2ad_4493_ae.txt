### Observations and Findings on Ad-Blockers

#### Time and Cost Savings
Our experiment revealed that ad-blockers saved participants time and money. However, it is important to note that ad-blockers are not designed to positively influence consumer behavior. We did not find empirical evidence supporting the claim that contextual online advertising improves or expedites the matching of consumers' needs with sellers who can offer lower prices. Additionally, we found no evidence that ad-blockers deprived users of potential shopping advantages or the privacy and security benefits associated with blocking ads.

#### Consumer Satisfaction
The use of ad-blockers did not significantly alter consumers' satisfaction with products, their prices, or perceived quality. However, participants in the Block condition (where ad-blockers were enabled) reported lower satisfaction with web page loading speed. This dissatisfaction may have indirect economic implications. For instance, slow browsing speeds could lead to abandoned shopping sessions or less thorough comparison shopping, potentially resulting in the purchase of more expensive products. Future fieldwork will further examine these indirect impacts.

#### Statistical Analysis
Although our main dependent variables did not show statistically significant results, the confidence intervals from the regressions provide valuable practical insights. 

1. **Price Differences:**
   - The confidence interval for the Block condition coefficient in Table 2 (S4) suggests with 95% confidence that people in the Block condition chose products that were no more than 10% cheaper or more expensive than the average price in a given category compared to those in the NoBlock condition.
   - When considering the reported use of ad-blockers outside the experimental setting, our results imply (as a correlational and not necessarily causal relationship) that with 95% confidence, participants who use ad-blockers on their home computers purchased products that were either similarly priced or up to 20% cheaper than those chosen by non-users.

2. **Search Time:**
   - The confidence interval for the Block condition coefficient in Table 3 (S5) suggests with 95% confidence that people randomized to the Block condition spent between 24 minutes less and 76 minutes longer (with an average of 26 minutes longer) on product search than those in the NoBlock condition.
   - While this finding is not statistically significant, the practical significance on an individual level is notable. Given an average hourly wage of $28, this translates into a potential loss of up to $35 in the worst-case scenario, a loss of $12 on average, and up to $11 in savings in the best-case scenario.

#### Long-Term Effects
Participants who use ad-blockers on their home computers tended to choose products that were, on average, 10–11% cheaper (p < 0.05) than those who do not use ad-blockers. This suggests that long-term use of ad-blockers may influence consumers' shopping choices, or that individuals who choose to use ad-blockers may have different shopping preferences.

### Effects of Organic and Sponsored Search Results

In the control condition where ads were displayed, participants who chose products from top sponsored links paid significantly higher prices (p = 0.01). Participants who chose products from sponsored Google Shopping listings paid, on average, lower but not significantly so (p = 0.06) prices than those who chose products from organic links. Moreover, satisfaction with products, their prices, and expected quality was lower when chosen following sponsored Google Shopping listings and bottom sponsored links compared to organic links, although these differences did not persist after product delivery.

### Moderators of Consumer Behavior

- **Branded Searches:** Participants spent less time searching for specific branded products and were less satisfied with their choices and prices. This may be due to the reduced need for comparison shopping, but also because of the limited options available.
- **Frequent Purchasers:** Participants who frequently purchase specific products chose lower-priced items and were more satisfied with their choices and expected quality. This aligns with previous research on loyalty effects and reflects consumers' prior experiences.
- **High Involvement:** High product involvement led participants to spend more time on product search and choose higher-priced products, which confirms the positive correlation between product-purchase involvement and price acceptability and satisfaction.

### Conclusion

Our experiment does not find evidence that the deployment of ad-blockers, aimed at protecting users' privacy and security and reducing clutter, has detrimental effects on consumers' welfare in terms of satisfaction with products, their prices, perceived quality, or time spent on online searching.
