### Recording and Converting Live Streams

#### Playing and Recording Live Streams
- **Functionality**: This utility allows you to play and record live streams.
- **Conversion**: It can also convert the recorded stream to an MP4 format.

**Note**: No video capture utility is perfect, and this option may not work every time. However, it is one of the best options available. If you frequently investigate targets who stream live video, this tool is essential.

**Example Output**:
```
[error]: No plugin can handle URL: https://ktla.com/on-air/live-streaming

```

**Compatibility**:
- This utility works well with most live and pre-recorded video streams on popular platforms such as Twitch and Vimeo.
- Some sites may cause errors, so it's recommended to use this tool in conjunction with the Stream Detector extension.

**Live Demonstration**:
1. Enter the live news video stream from KTLA at `https://ktla.com/on-air/live-streaming` into the Video Stream Tool.
2. If you receive a "No plugin can handle URL" error, load the site in a custom Firefox build to capture the M3U8 stream using the Stream Detector extension.
3. Copy the direct stream link and re-open the Video Stream Tool.
4. Choose the "Play and Record Live Stream" option and enter the new URL.
5. The tool will begin playing and archiving the video.
