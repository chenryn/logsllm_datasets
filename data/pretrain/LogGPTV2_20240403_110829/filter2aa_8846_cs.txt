 Provisioning and deprovisioning. Account creation and account deletion — provisioning and deprovisioning —
are key tasks in the account lifecycle. Create accounts too early and you have dormant accounts that can be
targeted. Wait too long to disable and delete accounts and you also have dormant accounts that can be targeted.
When feasible, it is a good practice to automate provisioning and deprovisioning. Automation helps reduce the
time to create and delete accounts. It also reduces human error (although the automation code could have human
error). Your company should establish guidelines for account provisioning and deprovisioning. For example, your
company might have a policy that an account must be disabled while the employee is in the meeting being notified
of their termination.

Domain 5 Review Questions
Read and answer the following questions. If you do not get at least one of them correct, then spend more time with the
subject. Then move on to Domain 6.
1. You are implementing a multi-factor authentication solution. As part of the design, you are capturing the three
authentication factors. What are they?
a. Something you make
b. Something you know
c. Something you have
d. Something you need
e. Something you are
f. Something you do
2. Your company is rapidly expanding its public cloud footprint, especially with Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), and
wants to update its authentication solution to enable users to be authenticated to services in the cloud that are yet
to be specified. The company issues the following requirements:
 Minimize the infrastructure required for the authentication.
 Rapidly deploy the solution.

Answers to Domain 5 Review Questions
1. Answer: B, C, E
Explanation: The three factors are something you know (such as a password), something you have (such as a
smartcard or authentication app), and something you are (such as a fingerprint or retina). Using methods from
multiple factors for authentication enhances security and mitigates the risk of a stolen or cracked password.
2. Answer: B
Explanation: With the rapid expansion to the cloud and the type of services in the cloud unknown, a cloud-based
identity service, especially one from your public cloud vendor, is the best choice. Such services are compatible with
IaaS, SaaS and PaaS solutions. While a third-party identity service can handle SaaS, it will not be as capable in nonSaaS scenarios. A federated identity solution is also limited to certain authentication scenarios and requires more
time to deploy and more work to manage.
3. Answer: D
Explanation: Because you found individual users being granted permissions, and an IT administrator had manually
changes permissions on the folder, DAC is in use. RBAC uses roles, and rule-based access control relies on rules
and user attributes, so you would not find individual users configured with permissions on the folder with either
of these. MAC is based on clearance levels, so, again, users aren’t individually granted permissions on a folder;
instead, a group for each clearance is used.

Domain 6. Security Assessment and Testing
This section covers assessments and audits, along with all the technologies and techniques you will be expected to know to
perform them.
6.1 Design and validate assessment, test and audit strategies
An organization’s assessment, testing and audit strategies will depend on its size, industry, financial status and other factors.
For example, a small non-profit, a small private company and a small public company will all have different requirements
and goals. Like any procedure or policy, the audit strategy should be assessed and tested regularly to ensure that the
organization is not doing a disservice to itself with the current strategy. There are three types of audit strategies:
 Internal. An internal audit strategy should be aligned to the organization’s business and day-to-day operations.
For example, a publicly traded company will have a more rigorous auditing strategy than a privately held company.
However, the stakeholders in both companies have an interest in protecting intellectual property, customer data
and employee information. Designing the audit strategy should include laying out applicable regulatory
requirements and compliance goals.
 External. An external audit strategy should complement the internal strategy, providing regular checks to ensure
that procedures are being followed and the organization is meeting its compliance goals.
 Third-party. Third-party auditing provides a neutral and objective approach to reviewing the existing design,
methods for testing and overall strategy for auditing the environment. A third-party audit can also ensure that both
internal and external auditors are following the processes and procedures that are defined as part of the overall
strategy.
6.2 Conduct security control testing
Security control testing can include testing of the physical facility, logical systems and applications. Here are the common
testing methods:
 Vulnerability assessment. The goal of a vulnerability assessment is to identify elements in an environment that
are not adequately protected. This does not always have to be from a technical perspective; you can also assess
the vulnerability of physical security or the external reliance on power, for instance. These assessments can include
personnel testing, physical testing, system and network testing, and other facilities tests.
 Penetration testing. A penetration test is a purposeful attack on systems to attempt to bypass automated
controls. The goal of a penetration test is to uncover weaknesses in security so they can be addressed to mitigate
risk. Attack techniques can include spoofing, bypassing authentication, privilege escalation and more. Like
vulnerability assessments, penetration testing does not have to be purely logical. For example, you can use social
engineering to try to gain physical access to a building or system.
62
 Log reviews. IT systems can log anything that occurs on the system, including access attempts and authorizations.
The most obvious log entries to review are any series of “deny” events, since someone is attempting to access
something that they don’t have permissions for. It’s more difficult to review successful events, since there are
generally thousands of them, and almost all of them follow existing policies. However, it can be important to show
that someone or something did indeed access a resource that they weren’t supposed to, either by mistake or
through privilege escalation. A procedure and software to facilitate frequent review of logs is essential.
 Synthetic transactions. While user monitoring captures actual user actions in real time, synthetic — scripted or
otherwise artificial — transactions can be used to test system performance or security.
 Code review and testing. Security controls are not limited to IT systems. The application development lifecycle
must also include code review and testing for security controls. These reviews and controls should be built into the
process just as unit tests and function tests are; otherwise, the application is at risk of being unsecure.
 Misuse case testing. Software and systems can both be tested for use for something other than its intended
purpose. From a software perspective, this could be to reverse engineer the binaries or to access other processes
through the software. From an IT perspective, this could be privilege escalation, sharing passwords and accessing
resources that should be denied.
 Test coverage analysis. You should be aware of the following coverage testing types:
 Black box testing. The tester has no prior knowledge of the environment being tested.
 White box testing. The tester has full knowledge prior to testing.
 Dynamic testing. The system that is being tested is monitored during the test.
 Static testing. The system that is being tested is not monitored during the test.
 Manual testing. Testing is performed manually by humans.
 Automated testing. A script performs a set of actions.
 Structural testing. This can include statement, decision, condition, loop and data flow coverage.
 Functional testing. This includes normal and anti-normal tests of the reaction of a system or software.
Anti-normal testing goes through unexpected inputs and methods to validate functionality, stability and
robustness.
 Negative testing. This test purposely uses the system or software with invalid or harmful data, and verifies
that the system responds appropriately.
 Interface testing. This can include the server interfaces, as well as internal and external interfaces. The server
interfaces include the hardware, software and networking infrastructure to support the server. For applications,
external interfaces can be a web browser or operating system, and internal components can include plug-ins, error
handling and more. You should be aware of the different testing types for each system.

6.3 Collect security process data
Organizations should collect data about policies and procedures and review it on a regular basis to ensure that the
established goals are being met. Additionally, they should consider whether new risks have appeared since the creation of
the process that must now be addressed.
 Account management. Every organization should have a defined procedure for maintaining accounts that have
access to systems and facilities. This doesn’t just mean documenting the creation of a user account, but can include
when that account expires and the logon hours of the account. This should also be tied to facilities access. For
example, was an employee given a code or key card to access the building? Are there hours that the access method
is also prevented? There should also be separate processes for managing accounts of vendors and other people
who might need temporary access.
 Management review and approval. Management plays a key role in ensuring that these processes are distributed
to employees, and that they are followed. The likelihood of a process or procedure succeeding without
management buy-in is minimal. The teams that are collecting the process data should have the full support of the
management team, including periodic reviews and approval of all data collection techniques.
 Key performance and risk indicators. You can associate key performance and risk indicators with the data that
is being collected. The risk indicators can be used to measure how risky the process, account, facility access or
other action is to the organization. The performance indicators can be used to ensure that a process or procedure
is successful and measure how much impact it has on the organization’s day-to-day operations.
 Backup verification data. A strict and rigorous backup procedure is almost useless without verification of the
data. Backups should be restored regularly to ensure that the data can be recovered successfully. When using
replication, you should also implement integrity checks to ensure that the data was not corrupted during the
transfer process.
 Training and awareness. Training and awareness of security policies and procedures are half the battle when
implementing or maintaining these policies. This extends beyond the security team that is collecting the data, and
can impact every employee or user in an organization. The table below outlines different levels of training that can
be used for an organization.

 Disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity (BC). Two areas that must be heavily documented are disaster
recovery and business continuity. Because these processes are infrequently used, the documentation plays a key
role helping teams understand what to do and when to do it. As part of your security assessment and testing, you
should review DR and BC documentation to ensure it is complete and represents a disaster from beginning to end.
