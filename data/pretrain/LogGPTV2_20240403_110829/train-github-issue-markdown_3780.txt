When using strict mode (which is recommended), certain functions such as `ceil()` and `floor()` may fail if used improperly in variable assignments. Specifically, the expressions inside these functions should be enclosed in additional parentheses. Additionally, `ceil()` calls within type definitions can also cause issues.

For example:
- Incorrect: `let x = ceil 5;`
- Correct: `let x = ceil(5);`

Similarly, ensure that `ceil()` and `floor()` are properly formatted when used in type definitions to avoid errors.
