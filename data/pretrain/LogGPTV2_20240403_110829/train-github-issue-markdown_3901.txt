## Expected Behavior
We should have documented as an example how to use the new next-sass plugin
## Current Behavior
We have a few examples to import `.sass` files which are mostly hacks to make
it work.
## Context
With the release of Next.js v5 the current examples of importing SASS/SCSS are
outdated and can be simplified with the new next-css plugin.
