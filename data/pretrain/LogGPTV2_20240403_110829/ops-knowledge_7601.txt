User: Can access AppEngine SDK sites via local ip-address when localhost works just fine and a MacOSX using the GoogleAppEngineLauncher.
I'm trying to setup facebook development site (using a dyndns.org hostname pointing at my firewall which redirects the call to my mac book).
It seems like GoogleAppEngineLauncher defaults to localhost and blocks access to the ip-address directly. 
Is there a way to change that behaviour in GoogleAppEngineLauncher?
Is this some kind of limitation built in by Google?
It doesn't seem to be an issue of configuration, because there isn't any settings for this.
So I'm guessing patching the source will be required?
Assistant: In Android Studio with Google App Engine plugin.
Just add httpAddress = '0.0.0.0' to app cfg in build.grade file.
