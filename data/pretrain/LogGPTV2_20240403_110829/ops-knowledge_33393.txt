User: I understand tornado is a single threaded and non-Blocking server, hence requests are handled sequentially (except when using event driven approach for IO operation).
Is there a way to process multiple requests parallel in tornado for normal(non-IO) execution. I can't fork multiple process since I need a common memory space across requests.
If its not possible please suggest to me other python servers which can handle parallel request and also supports wsgi.
Assistant: If you are truly going to be dealing with multiple simultaneous requests that are compute-bound, and you want to do it in Python, then you need a multi-process server, not multi-threaded.  CPython has  Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) that prevents more than one thread from executing python bytecode at the same time.
Most web applications do very little computation, and instead are waiting for I/O, either from the database, or the disk, or from services on other servers.  Be sure you need to handle compute-bound requests before discarding Tornado.
