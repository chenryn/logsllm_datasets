Humio Scalability Benchmark 
100TB Daily Ingestion & Real-Time Observability
On May 20, 2019, Humio announced the results of scalability benchmark testing that confirms real-time visibility of data at ingestion rates of 100TB per day. This paper describes details of that benchmark testing.

The purpose of this benchmark testing is to show publicly the capabilities that Humio already delivers to its customers. Specifically, the goals of the testing demonstrate that:

 Humio is able to ingest log data at a rate of at least 100TB/day with ease.
Accelerated and highly accurate searches can be performed in real-time at scale. The Humio architecture and approach scales linearly.The benchmark results can be leveraged to assist customers in defining a log management reference architecture for cloud and/or on-premise deployments without constraints.
Test Bed Overview
Humio deliberately created a test environment that is easy to deploy, flexible and uses elements that are widely available and understood. It was designed to replicate an environment similar to that of current and potential Humio customers – enterprises with large volumes of log data. Importantly, it was not custom-tuned to artificially produce optimized performance results.Humio’s goal is to help enterprises maximize their use of log data while minimizing the cost and complexi-ty of ingestion, query and analysis, so making a testbed that is easy to deploy and manage was a high priority.While Humio previously ran a variety of tests on many nodes simultaneously, the goal of this round of benchmarking was to see if its approach could scale linearly to 25 nodes starting with 10 Humio nodes. The test bed was made up of Humio pods and testing framework pods deployed on Kubernetes. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) was selected because the test developer has familiarity with this environment, but the testing infrastructure could also be run on AWS, Azure or other cloud platforms.Humio Scalability Benchmark
The test bed consisted of two main elements code-named Nebulosa and Strix:
| Nebulosa | Strix |
|---|---|
| 	(40) Standard Instances  (25) for Humio, (13) for Kafka, (5) for Zookeeper 	(24) N-Standard Instances 1) “Nebulosa” – 40 n-standard pods – 25 for Humio, 13 for Kafka, and 5 for Zookeeper, each pod with Each pod with 1TB of SSD  1TB of SSD. |	(40) Standard Instances  (25) for Humio, (13) for Kafka, (5) for Zookeeper 	(24) N-Standard Instances 1) “Nebulosa” – 40 n-standard pods – 25 for Humio, 13 for Kafka, and 5 for Zookeeper, each pod with Each pod with 1TB of SSD  1TB of SSD. |Separating the two elements ensured that only Humio activity was being measured and wasn’t being mixed with testing processes. In addition, separating out the testing platform simplified management and allowed for testing of different scenarios. Both Nebulosa and Strix are GitHub projects.
Terraform and Helm were used for infrastructure provisioning and configuration. Again, these open source tools were selected because they are widely used for Kubernetes, but alternatives are available.Test Methodology
A log generator produced a stream of data similar to a syslog environment. The ingest rate was measured with Humio’s Scala-based load-testing framework. The cumulative measurement of ingested data was made by observing devices where ingested data had been stored.Particularly noteworthy is the fact that no indexing was used. Instead, the test bed employed Humio’s unique approach to ingesting, compressing (up to 10:1), searching and analyzing log data. Humio parses the data as it is ingested, sends it through a Kafka queue and makes it available for analysis in an average of 20ms. 
Key Results
Over a six-day period in early May 2019, between 100TB and 110TB of log data was ingested every day.Humio Scalability Benchmark
Ingest rates consistently reached over 100TB/day, peaking at 150TB/day.
Depending on the size of the event, over 2.5 million events/second were recorded consistently. 
To demonstrate real-time search capabilities, the term “Hello World” was embedded numerous times in the data stream but was not identified as a field. Even without indexing, the term was successfully found throughout an ingest process running at up to 119GB/s.Humio Scalability Benchmark
There are two key takeaways from these results:
 Log data can be ingested at a rate of at least 100TB/day and can be queried with sub-second latency and be queried at hundreds of gigabytes per second.
The linear scalability of the Humio approach means even higher ingest/query rates can be achieved without costly IT infrastructure upgrades and/or customization.Market Implications/Use Cases
One of the biggest obstacles to widespread enterprise adoption of observability tools is scalability. Humio is purpose-built to help customers achieve the benefits of large-scale logging and analysis. By demon-strating that its service can scale to 100TB/day and beyond, Humio has shown that it is now both feasible and cost-effective to “log everything and miss nothing”.  This frees enterprises to expand the scope of collecting, analyzing and learning from logs to improve their security posture and reduce attack surfaces, optimize business operations and enhance customer experiences.To date, most enterprises don’t log everything due to cost avoidance. And even in cases where logging is conducted on a large scale, the time to meaningful insight – especially for time-sensitive use cases - can be so long (minutes, even hours) that teams responsible for managing logs are often compromised in their ability to avoid or mitigate potentially damaging events or operational issues.“Humio’s unlimited ingest pricing now enables us to scale our data without worry.”
- Rob McCurdy, CIO at MSU
Worth noting is that “observability” is not just monitoring. It is understanding the total environment in which events take place and identifying (in as close to real-time as possible) where anomalies and flags are occurring, so action can be taken quickly. The more logs collected, the greater the chance of finding “the needle in the haystack.” The fewer logs collected, the greater the chance that important information will go undetected.“Humio not only manages all our log data but also allows us to do real-time, complex queries on our log stream that wasn’t possible before.”
- Alex Tasioulis, Platform Engineering Lead at On the dotFor security operators, logging everything can make a huge difference in determining if a threat or breach is legitimate. Limiting visibility to only portions of logs introduces great risks. When an attack occurs through some application or device a team isn’t able to log, due to cost and/or hardware constraints, the time to detect, investigate and respond to the threat or failure is be much longer because teams don’t have full visibility. For software developers and IT managers, logging everything reduces mean-time-to-re-covery (MTTR), accelerating resolution of problems and improving the customer or end-user experience. For businesses of all kinds, logging everything can lead to more quickly identifying and resolving situa-tions where the customer experience is less than optimal.Humio Scalability Benchmark
“The query language and speed of Humio compared to searching logs in Kibana is crazy! Much better experience in my opinion, and makes investigating and caring about logs so much easier.”
- Rob McCurdy, CIO at MSU
Summary of BenchmarkWhile most organizations currently utilizing log data rarely produce more than 10-20TB of data per day, all expectations are that the use of log data will increase exponentially in the years ahead. This benchmark confirms that Humio can support high-volume log management environments today – using readily avail-able tools and modern infrastructure technologies without the need for custom tuning. As a result, log data can be ingested and queried in real-time at the rate of at least 100TB/day. This performance break-through opens vast possibilities for enterprises to expand their use of log data.For more information, go to https://info.humio.com/100tb-benchmark
