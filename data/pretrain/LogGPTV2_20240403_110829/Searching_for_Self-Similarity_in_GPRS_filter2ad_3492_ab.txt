### Estimation of the Hurst Parameter (H)

The slope \(\alpha\) of the straight line in a log-log plot, which represents the first moment of the aggregated block over the block size, provides an estimator for \(H\) using the relationship \(H = 1 + \alpha\).

#### Ratio of Variance of Residuals
This method relies on the empirical observation that the sample variance of residuals, when plotted against the aggregation level, yields a slope approximately equal to \(2H\). This indicates some degree of self-similarity.

#### Frequency-Based Methods

**Periodogram Method**
This method is based on the power-spectrum singularity at 0. The slope of the straight line approximating the logarithm of the spectral density over the frequency as the frequency approaches 0, provides an estimate for \(H\).

**Abry-Veitch Method**
This method leverages multi-resolution analysis and discrete wavelet transformation. \(H\) is estimated by fitting a straight line to the energy in the series over octave \(j\) (expressing the scaling level in both the time and frequency domains) in a log-log plot. This method is considered the most comprehensive and robust for determining the scaling behavior of traffic traces. Its strength lies in the structural affinity between multi-resolution analysis and the scaling process under study, as it simplifies the complex scaling process into a more manageable wavelet domain where short-range dependent (SRD) statistics can be applied [10].

### Results from Our Traces
We present results from our traces using all mentioned methods, with a particular focus on the Abry-Veitch method to derive the scaling nature of the process.

All methods provide intermediate statistics used to derive the Hurst value. For example, in the Variance Method, these are the aggregated variance values for each aggregation level, while in the Abry-Veitch method, the intermediate statistics are the wavelet coefficients. Linear regression is then used to fit a straight line and derive the Hurst value.

It is important to note that typically, not all values from the intermediate statistics should be included in the linear regression. For the R/S method, Variance Method, and Absolute Moment method, it is recommended to exclude the results from the first few and the last few aggregation levels, as these values are less reliable due to either too few or too many points per block. In the Periodogram Method, only the first 10 percent of the results, close to the frequency 0, should be used, justified by the asymptotic long-range dependency (LRD) property near frequency 0. The Abry-Veitch method, being the most robust, shows the scaling of the process over all aggregation levels, allowing for the optimal selection of a starting point for the regression, indicated by a \(\chi^2\)-goodness-of-fit test. For LRD traffic, the regression line is fitted from this starting point to the largest available octave in the data.

We use the SELFIS tool [11] to derive intermediate statistics for all methods except the Abry-Veitch method, and the LDestimate-code [12] for the Abry-Veitch method. For the SELFIS tool, we apply our own linear regression on the intermediate results, excluding the first two and the last two aggregation levels, to avoid bias from outliers. This manual regression generally provides better fits than the direct output from SELFIS. The differences in \(H\) values between the manually applied linear regression and the final results from SELFIS can be significant, highlighting the importance of post-processing. The LD estimator function for the Abry-Veitch method suggests an optimal starting point for \(j\) and plots the scaling behavior over all octaves, allowing for a judgment of the type of scaling.

### Data Traces
In collaboration with Vodafone, we conducted measurements in two live GPRS networks, capturing IP packet headers at the Gi interface for all users in a geographical region. The Gi interface connects the mobile network to external packet-switched networks such as the Internet, corporate Intranets, and WAP/MMS proxies. All IP packets traversing this interface were recorded during summer 2003.

For each packet, we collected a timestamp with 1Âµs accuracy and the total length in bytes. We generated the Packet Arrival Process (PAP) and the Data Volume Process (DVP) from the original trace. The PAP is a discrete time-series process counting the number of packets, and the DVP measures the total number of bytes within a 100 ms bin.

We are interested in the scaling behavior of the aggregated traffic, WAP-oriented traffic, and WEB-oriented traffic. We analyzed three "sup-sampled" traces: the total aggregated traffic (up and downlink), WEB-oriented traffic, and WAP-oriented traffic. The traffic was split according to the Access Point Names (APNs), which logically separate different types of traffic on the Gi interface. One APN primarily handles WEB-like applications (HTTP, FTP, Email, etc.), while the other APN handles WAP and MMS traffic. However, occasional cross-traffic does occur.

In one network (Vfe1), the traffic split is 25% WEB-APN and 75% WAP-APN, while in the other network (Vfe2), the split is 70% WEB-APN and 30% WAP-APN. We traced several 24-hour periods and focused on busy-hour periods spanning several hours. Our results are presented for one selected day for each network: a 110-minute busy-hour period in the afternoon for Vfe1 and a 430-minute (7-hour) busy-hour period for Vfe2. We ensured the chosen periods were stationary and free of periodicities or trends by applying moving average, Fourier transformation, and average run tests.

### Results on Self-Similarity
We present detailed results obtained by the Abry-Veitch method, along with Hurst estimations from other methods. Tables 1 and 2 show the estimated Hurst values for the PAP, with confidence intervals listed in the third row. Figures 1 and 2 compare the Hurst values from different methods, indicating strong long-range dependency with Hurst values around 0.8 and higher for both networks.

**Figures 3 and 4. All Hurst values for DVP and Vfe1, Vfe2**

While some Hurst values exceed 1, the confidence intervals from the Abry-Veitch method include values below 1, and the output plots suggest asymptotic self-similarity.
