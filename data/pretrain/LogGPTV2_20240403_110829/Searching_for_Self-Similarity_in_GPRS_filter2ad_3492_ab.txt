slope α of the straight line in a log-log plot, depicting the first moment of the aggre-
gated block over the block size, provides an estimator for H, by H = 1+α.
Ratio of Variance of Residuals
This uses the empirical observation, that is, the sample variance of residuals, plot-
ted  over  the  aggregation  level,  yields  a  slope  equivalent  to  roughly  2H.  It  indicates
some self-similarity.
The next two methods are frequency-based:
Periodogram method
This  method  is  based  on  the  power-spectrum  singularity  at  0-property  as  stated
above. The slope of the straight line, approximating the logarithm of the spectral den-
sity over the frequency as the frequency approaches 0, yields H.

Abry-Veitch method
This  method  is  based  on  the  multi-resolution  analysis  and  the  discrete  wavelet
transformation. H is estimated by fitting a straight line to the energy in the series over
octave j (expressing the scaling level in the time and the frequency domain) in a log-
log plot.1 This method is the most comprehensive and robust method for determining
the scaling behavior of traffic traces. It strength follows from the fact that the multi-
resolution analysis itself  has a structural affinity  to  the  scaling  process  under  study.
That  is,  multi-resolution  analysis  itself  exploits  scaling,  but  transfers  the  complex
scaling process to  a  much  simpler  wavelet  domain,  in  which  short  range  dependent
(SRD) statistics can be applied to infer answers on the scaling of the process [10].
We show results from our traces for all mentioned methods. In particular we will
use the Abry-Veitch method to derive the scaling nature of the process.
All used methods provide some intermediate statistics, which is used to derive the
Hurst  value.  For  instance,  in  the  case  of  the  Variance  Method,  these  are  the  aggre-
gated variance values  for each aggregation level; or, in the case of the Abry-Veitch
method, the intermediate statistics used are the wavelet coefficients. Based on those
values linear regression is used to fit a straight line to derive the Hurst value.
Important to consider is that typically the linear regression should not consider all
of the values from the intermediate statistic. In case of the R/S method, the Variance
Method and the Absolute Moment method, it is recommended not to use the results of
the first few aggregations levels and neither the last few aggregation levels. The rea-
son for  this  is  that  these  values  are  not  very  reliable  because  either  the  aggregation
level  is  too  low  (sampling  too  few  points  per  block)  or  it  is  too  high  (sampling  all
points in just a few blocks). In the case of the Periodogram Method it is recommended
only to use approximately the first 10 percent of the results, close to the frequency 0.
This is justified by the asymptotic LRD property close to the frequency 0. The Abry-
Veitch method is the most robust of all estimation methods [10]. It actually shows the
scaling of the process over all aggregation levels (octave j), which allows to optimally
select an appropriate starting point for the regression. This starting point is indicated
by a χ2-goodness-of-fit test. In the case of assumed LRD traffic, the regression line is
fitted from this starting point to the largest available octave in the data.
We  use  the  SELFIS  tool  [11]  to  derive  the  intermediate  statistics  for  all  but  the
Abry-Veitch  method.  Additionally,  we  use  the  LDestimate-code  which  implements
the Abry-Veitch method [12]. In the case of the SELFIS tool we applied our own lin-
ear regression on the intermediate results obtained from SELFIS, as explained above.
This is necessary as SELFIS estimates H, always based on a linear regression over all
available points, which can heavily bias the results due to outliers at the end points.
For this reason  we  shortened the intermediate  statistical  results  to  all  but  the  first  2
and the last 2 aggregation levels. In all cases, applying the manual regression, the fit
is better than the SELFIS tool directly provides. The differences in the values of H,
between  manually  applied  linear  regression  and  the  final  results  of  SELFIS,  are
1 More precisely, based on the wavelet coefficient dj,k the amount of energy |dj,k|2 in the signal
at about the time t=2jk and about the frequency 2-jλ is measured. Ε[ |dj,k|2 ] is the amount of
energy at octave j. If the initial resolution of the time series is t0 (bin size), the time resolution
at each scaling level j is tj=2jt0.

sometimes  quite  large,  which  stresses  the  importance  to  apply  manual  post-
processing. The LD estimator function  for the Abry-Veitch test  suggests an optimal
starting point  for j which  we  always  used.  It  furthermore  plots  the  scaling  behavior
over all octaves j, allowing to judge on the type of scaling. We discuss those results as
well.
4  Data Traces
In  cooperation  with  Vodafone  we  conducted  measurements  in  two  live  GPRS  net-
works. We captured the IP packet headers at the Gi interface for all  users in a geo-
graphical region of the operator’s GPRS network. The Gi interface connects the mo-
bile  network  to  external  packet  switched  networks  (like  the  Internet,  a  corporate
Intranet or Email and WAP/MMS proxies). All IP packets from or to mobile termi-
nals traverse this interface. The traces we focus on were taken during summer 2003.
We collect for every packet crossing the network monitor interface a time stamp,
with 1µs accuracy, with the total length of the packet in bytes. For our further investi-
gations we generate from the original trace the Packet Arrival Process (PAP) as a dis-
crete  time-series  process  by  counting  the  number  of  packets  and  the  Data  Volume
Process (DVP) as the total number of bytes within a time interval (bin) or 100 ms.
We are interested in the scaling behavior for the aggregated traffic, WAP oriented
traffic  and  WEB  oriented  traffic.  For  this  purpose  we  look  at  three  “sup-“sampled
traces.  Firstly,  we  investigate  the  total  aggregated  traffic  (up  and  downlink  traffic),
which we measured on the Gi interface. Next, we have split-up the traffic into WEB
oriented traffic and WAP oriented traffic. We do this by splitting the data according to
the APN (Access Point Names) they are belonging to. GPRS allows users to attach to
different APNs provided by the operator. Typically, the APNs are used for different
types  of  traffic  and  split  logically  the  traffic  on  the  Gi  interface.  We  checked  our
measurements for the used applications and found that most of the traffic on one APN
consists  of  WEB  like  applications,  including  HTTP,  FTP,  Email,  etc.  On  the  other
APN  we  see  mostly  WAP  like  traffic,  comprising  WAP  and  MMS.2  However,  the
APNs do not filter for applications, hence it occasionally happens that we see WEB
traffic on the WAP APN and vice versa.
On  one  of  the  network  measurement  points  (Vfe1)  the  traffic  splits  up  into  25%
WEB-APN and 75% WAP APN traffic, while in the other network (Vfe2) the split is
70% WEB APN and 30% WAP APN traffic.
We traced several 24-hour periods and investigated appropriate busy-hour periods
spanning several hours, for each of the networks. Our results will be presented only
for  one  selected  day  for  each  network.  In  the  case  of  Vfe1  we  chose  a  110-minute
busy-hour period in the afternoon, in the case of Vfe2 we chose a 430-min (7-hour )
busy-hour period covering the whole afternoon. Since all estimator methods (with ex-
ception of the Abry-Veitch method) require stationarity and often are very sensitive to
underlying trends or correlations in the traffic process [13], we investigated the cho-
sen busy-hour periods on trends by plotting the moving average, on periodicity by in-

tions.

vestigating the Fourier transformation, and on stationarity by applying the average run
test. All tests indicated the suitability of the chosen periods for the estimation meth-
ods, i.e., they appear to be stationary and they have no visible periodicities or trends.
5  Results on Self-similarity
We present for all processes detailed results obtained by the Abry-Veitch method, to-
gether with Hurst estimations acquired by the other described methods. Table 1 and
Table 2 show the results  for the estimated Hurst values by the Abry-Veitch method
for the packet arrival process. The second row  ‘H’ contains the Hurst values and in
the third row marked ‘conf.’ the confidence values for the estimated Hurst values are
listed.  Figure  1  and  Figure  2  illustrate  the  Hurst  values  obtained  from  the  different
methods, for comparison. All values are very similar with Hurst values of about 0.8
and higher. This strongly suggests long range dependency for the PAP for both net-
works Vfe1 and Vfe2.

In some cases the Hurst value is above 1, actually precluding LRD, but in the case
of the Abry-Veitch method all confidence intervals include also a value of below 1.
Furthermore, as explained next, inspection of the output-plots suggests in such cases
still asymptotic self-similarity.

For the DVP, Table 3 and Figure 3 list the Hurst values for Vfe1 and Table 3 and
Figure 4 list the Hurst values for Vfe2. Again all results strongly indicate LRD.
All  estimation  methods,  except  for  the  Abry-Veitch  method,  assume  an  LRD
model beforehand. That is, the Hurst estimation value can only be regarded as correct
if the  assumption  of  an  LRD  process  holds.  In  contrast,  the  Abry-Veitch  test  is  not
based on such assumptions. It shows the scaling of the process for all time scales in
the diagram. Only by interpreting the results in this Logscale Diagram, the true nature
of the process is determined (e.g., self-similarity, long-range dependency, multiscal-
ing) [10]. For our traces we have encountered four basic log-scale diagram types, de-
picted in Figure 5 to Figure 8. In Table 1 to Table 4  we list in the 4th row for each
process  the  plot  that  comes  closest,  respectively.  The  individual  plots  looked  very
similar to the exemplary plots, but with different scales on the y-axes.
