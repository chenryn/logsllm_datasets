up the localized page rank of the unreachable pages.
Finally, note that there is a close resemblance between a user session and
a TCP ﬂow. This makes the BLP a good estimate of the false positive rate
expected when the allergic signatures are evaluated against a normal traﬃc
corpus. In particular, any TCP ﬂow that is ﬁltered by some allergic signature
will correspond to the same user session under our model: the one that visits the
same pages as in the ﬂow until the ﬁrst unreachable page is accessed.
4 Type II Allergy Attack
The term “type II allergy attack” was coined in [2] as a speciﬁc type of allergy
attack, though the idea ﬁrst appeared in [17] as a threat against their blacklisting
mechanism, quoted as follows:
However, even this approach may fall short against a sophisticated at-
tacker with prior knowledge of an unreleased document. In this scenario
an attacker might coerce Earlybird into blocking the documents released
by simulating a worm containing substrings unique only to the unreleased
document.
In other words, the type II allergy attack targets future traﬃc and induces the
ASG into generating signatures to match patterns that appear in future traﬃc,

but not those at present. As a result, the generated signatures will be deemed
acceptable when matched against the blacklist in [17,5], or any static corpus
which cannot predict what future traﬃc will be like. In order to prevent type II
attacks, the defender must identify all traﬃc components that evolve over time
(and avoid generating signatures for those components), or the signatures must
be constantly re-evaluated.1
A point worth noting is that it is not always necessary to predict how traﬃc
will evolve in order to launch a type II attack. The discussions in [17,2] assume
that the corpus is always “fresh” and captures all the normal traﬃc at the time of
the attack. However, it may not always be feasible to keep an up-to-date corpus;
in addition to the possibly prohibitive cost of constantly updating the corpus,
as mentioned in Sect. 2, a relatively old corpus may also be needed as a defense
against innocuous pool poisoning. In other words, instead of targeting “future”
traﬃc only, we should consider a type II allergy attack as one that induces the
ASG into generating signatures to ﬁlter traﬃc that appears only after the corpus
is generated. As we will see, this signiﬁcantly increases the power of the type II
allergy attacks, and allows the attack to have instant eﬀect.
In the following, we will show how some components common in HTTP re-
quests can be exploited by a type II attack, and analyze the amount of damages
that these attacks can cause on some example web sites.
4.1 Dates in URLs
The ﬁrst common component in HTTP requests that can be utilized by a type
II allergy attack is the date encoded in URLs. Websites that constantly put up
new materials while keeping old ones available usually have the creation date
of a page encoded somewhere in its URL. This provides a very handy way of
organizing materials created at diﬀerent time. Examples of websites that organize
their pages in this manner include CNN.com, whitehouse.gov, yahoo.com and
symantec.com. In the following, we will take CNN.com as an example for our
study of type II attacks targeting dates encoded in URLs.
We start our study of CNN.com by ﬁnding out URLs of pages under CNN.com,
as well as how they link to one another. For this purpose, we employ a simple
web crawler based on [10]. Our web crawler starts at www.cnn.com, the “root
page” under the localized random surfer model. Because of resource limitation,
we only focus on pages that are reachable within 5 clicks from the root page.
Furthermore, at any visited page, the crawler will only expand its exploration
to pages that either reside in the same directory as the current page, or are in
a direct subdirectory of the one holding the current page. However, due to the
redirection of some URLs under CNN.com to other sites, our web crawler also
collects information of pages under Time.com, EW.com and Money.cnn.com.
We performed our experiments from 16th Feb to 9th Mar, 2007, and crawled
the target site at 9am and 12 noon every day. In all our experiments, the web
crawler retrieved more than 5000 URLs in total, and more than 1000 of the

enumerate them and perform the checking only when these events occurs.

URLs are under the server CNN.com. We note the above restrictions may result
in undercounted BLP for some allergic signatures. However, since pages that are
more than 5 clicks away from the root usually have very low page rank, and
pages under CNN.com usually link to other pages that are either in the same
directory or a subdirectory, we believe the inaccuracy caused by the restrictions
on the web crawler should be minimal.
With the information collected, we studied how the BLP of 5 signatures that
encode the date of 24th to 28th Feb evolve from 5 days before to 4 days af-
ter the designated day (e.g. for the signature “/02/24/”, we measured its BLP
for each of the two data sets collected from 19th to the 28th of Feb). As men-
tioned before, we use the BLP as both a measure of the damage caused by
the allergic signature and an estimate of the false positive caused when the it
is evaluated against traﬃc collected on a particular day. Finally, in the follow-
ing discussion, we will call the day designated by the “date-encoding” signature
“day 0”, the day that’s one day before will be denoted as “day -1”, that which
is one day after “day 1”, and so on. The results of our experiments are shown in
Fig. 1a.
As we see from Fig. 1a, all 5 tested signatures produce a zero BLP before
the corresponding day 0. We have experimented with other allergic signatures
which encode the dates ranging from 16th Feb to 9th Mar, and they all show
a similar pattern. Though in some cases, the tested allergic signatures appear
before the corresponding day 0. This is usually caused by URLs that point to
pages created in the previous years (e.g. we ﬁnd the string “/02/21/” in two
URLs that point to the 21st Feb, 2005 issue of the Money magazine). Nonethe-
less, the BLP of all the tested signatures remain below 1.5 ∗ 10−6 before day 0.
Thus, any allergic signature encoding a date after the corpus is generated will

Fig. 1. Fig. 1a on the left shows how the BLP of 5 diﬀerent date-encoded signatures
changes from 5 days before to 4 days after the designated date (with the designated
date denoted by day 0, days before that denoted by day -1, day -2 and so forth, days
after are denoted day 1, day 2, etc). The BLP of the tested signature at 9am of day n
is denoted by the point directly above the mark “n” on the x-axis, while the BLP at
12noon is denoted by the point between “n” and “n+1” on the x-axis. Fig. 1b on the
right shows the eﬀectiveness of type II attacks that target dates in URL when used
against corpus of diﬀerent age and launched on 5 diﬀerent days (24th - 28th Feb).

have a false positive below 1.5 ∗ 10−4% when evaluated against the corpus2. In
other words, the type II allergy attack that employ “date-encoding” signatures
will evade even corpus-based defenses with a very low false positive threshold
(both [16,8] suggested a 1% threshold, while the lowest threshold used in [12] is
0.001%).
Now let’s consider the power of the described attack against an up-to-date
corpus. Assuming that any allergic signature will be removed within a day since
it start ﬁltering normal traﬃc, it appears the attacker should induce the ASG
into generating one single allergic signature for some future day (extra signatures
will take eﬀect on a diﬀerent day, and thus cannot add to the damages at day 0).
From Fig. 1a, we see that this attack will create a more than 6% chance for
visitors to CNN.com to reach an unavailable page if the allergic signature is not
removed by 9am. Also, note that the two days with the lowest BLP, 24th and
25th Feb, are both weekend days. In other words, the amount of damage for the
type II allergy attack studied above can be far greater if it targets a weekday;
the BLP created can be as high as 0.12 at 9am, and up to 0.2 if the attack is
not stopped by noon. Finally, we’d like to point out that the attack against an
up-to-date corpus requires a certain “build-up” time to reach the level of damage
predicted. In other words, the ﬁgures given above only apply if the attack is not
detected until 9am or 12noon; if the allergic signature is removed in the ﬁrst few
hours of day 0, the damage caused will be much smaller.
On the other hand, if the corpus is n-day old, with the same notation used
above, the attacker can induce the ASG to generate signatures for the date of
day 0 to day -(n-1). For example, the attack on 16th Feb against a 3-day-old
corpus will involve the signatures “/02/16”, “/02/15/” and “/02/14/”. We have
experimented with the eﬀectiveness of this attack when it is launched at noon
of the 5 diﬀerent days tested above, against a corpus of “age” ranging from 1
day to a week, the results of our experiments are shown in Fig. 1b.
As shown in Fig. 1b, the use of a 2-day-old corpus instead of a fresh one
will almost double the damage caused by the attack, and an attack against a
one-week old corpus will produce a BLP of 0.25 to 0.3 with just 7 signatures.
Thus, the attack against an old corpus is signiﬁcantly more powerful than that
against a “fresh” one. Furthermore, by targeting existing traﬃc patterns, the
attack can produce instant eﬀect; in other words, the BLP resulted will reach
its maximum once the allergic signatures are in place. This is a sharp contrast
to the attack against a “fresh” corpus which may take a few hours to build up
its level of damage.
Finally, we note that the attacks described above are easily identiﬁable once
the broken links are reported and human intervention is called in. As we have
already noted, human intervention defeats the purpose of ASGs, and the at-
tacks can make some important parts of
site temporarily
unavailable.

2 We believe it is highly unlikely that the studied signatures will match some other
parts of an HTTP requests, since dates in other ﬁelds are represented diﬀerently,
and the use of “/” outside the URL is very uncommon.

4.2 Timestamp in Cookies
Another component in HTTP traﬃc that can be utilized by a type II attack is
the timestamp in web cookies. Web cookies are employed by many sites to keep
track of user preferences. New visitors to these websites will receive a set of web
cookies together with the content of the ﬁrst page requested. The cookies will
be stored in the user’s machine, and will be sent with all further HTTP requests
to the site. Also, an expiration date is associated with each cookie sent to the
user, and when the date is reached, a new cookie will be issued.
We ﬁnd that some sites use cookies to record the time for various user events.
For example, cookies from Amazon.com contains an 11-digit “session-id-time”
which expires in a week and records the day where the user’s last session started.
Another example of these timestamp cookies are the “TM” and “LM” cookies
from Google.com, where the former stores the time when the user ﬁrst visited
the site, while the latter records when the user last modiﬁes his/her preferences.
The time recorded in “TM” and “LM” are accurate up to one second, and will
not expire until year 2038. In other words, the “TM” value for any existing user
will remain the same, while the “LM” value only changes infrequently.
A type II allergy attack can exploit these timestamp cookies by inducing the
ASG into generating signatures that match future values taken by these cook-
ies (or their preﬁxes). To avoid the signatures from unintendedly matching other
parts of HTTP requests, the name of the cookies should be included, e.g. sig-
natures targeting the “session-id-time” cookie should be of the form “session-id-
time=xxxx”. With this signature format and a value for “xxxx” that is only used
after the corpus is generated, the signatures should be deemed usable by the ASG.
As for the eﬀectiveness of the attack, let’s assume the corpus used is up-to-
date. The attack against Amazon.com will then employ a signature that ﬁlters
the value taken by the “session-id-time” cookie on a particular future day 0,
and will make all pages under Amazon.com inaccessible to any user who has the
corresponding cookie expires on or before day 0; their session-id-time cookie will
be updated to the value targeted by the attack after the ﬁrst request, resulting
in all subsequent requests being ﬁltered. Similarly, the attack against the “TM”
and “LM” will target the values taken by these cookies on a particular future
day, and will make all pages under Google.com unavailable to any user that
either modiﬁes their preference or ﬁrst visit the site on the designated day. Even
though the attacked sites will be virtually unreachable to any aﬀected users, we
note that this may only be a small portion of the user population.
On the other hand, if the ASG employs an old corpus, the attack can target
all values that the timestamp cookies can take after the corpus is generated,
and create more signiﬁcant damages. Note that virtually all HTTP requests to
Amazon.com will contain a “session-id-time” cookie that is generated between
day 0 and day -6; any other timestamp cookies will have expired, and will be
updated after the ﬁrst request. As a result, if the corpus used is more than one
week old, the attacker can induce the ASG into generating signatures for all
valid values of the “session-id-time” cookie, and eﬀectively make all pages under
246
S.P. Chung and A.K. Mok
Amazon.com unavailable. As for the attack against Google.com, an old corpus
means the attacker can deny the access to the site for all users that ﬁrst visited
Google.com or modiﬁed their preference after the corpus is generated.
In conclusion, an up-to-date corpus is very eﬀective in limiting the power of
a type II attack. However, using a “fresh” corpus also makes it easier for worms
to evade the ASG through innocuous poisoning. The use of a corpus with traﬃc
collected over a long period of time (which is a solution to “innocuous pool
