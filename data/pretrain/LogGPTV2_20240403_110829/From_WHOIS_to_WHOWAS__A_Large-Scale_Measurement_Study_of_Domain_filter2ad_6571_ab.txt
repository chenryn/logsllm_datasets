### Scope and Applicability of the GDPR
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a broad scope that extends beyond the European Union (EU). Specifically, it applies to "the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the EU," regardless of whether the processing occurs within the EU or if the data processor is located within the EU.

### Impact of the GDPR on Domain Registration
Due to its extensive protection, the GDPR has significantly impacted internet applications that rely on personal data. For instance, websites must now obtain explicit consent before setting browser cookies [42]. Since domain registration involves collecting information about registrants and other personnel, it falls under the purview of the GDPR.

#### ICANN Temporary Specification
To bridge the gap between the GDPR's high-level requirements and the practical implementation of data protection, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) released the Temporary Specification for gTLD Registration Data [11] on May 17, 2018, just one week before the GDPR took effect. This document applies to all gTLD registry operators and ICANN-accredited registrars, aiming to maintain the accessibility of the current WHOIS system "to the greatest extent possible." It retains the existing procedure for collecting registration data, so domain holders still provide their personal information to registrars. However, WHOIS providers must take additional steps when releasing domain registration data (e.g., responding to WHOIS queries) if they:
1. Are located in the European Economic Area (EEA),
2. Are located outside the EEA but offer registration services to registrants in the EEA, or
3. Engage a data processor in the EEA.

Table I summarizes the requirements, covering data subjects such as registrants, administrative contacts, technical contacts, and others. Prior to the GDPR, many registrars used WHOIS privacy protection services (e.g., WhoisGuard [15]) to shield registrants' information from spammers, marketing firms, and online fraudsters. These services install an anonymous proxy identity for the registrant in the WHOIS database. If all fields in Table I are masked by the proxy, no additional changes are needed to comply with the GDPR.

Regarding the scope, the ICANN Temporary Specification allows WHOIS providers the flexibility to choose whether the protection applies globally or only in GDPR-governed regions. In other words, it is acceptable for a provider to release the original WHOIS data for domain holders living outside the EEA. In this paper, we refer to domains registered by EEA registrants as "EEA domains" and their associated WHOIS records as "EEA records." Similarly, "non-EEA domains" and "non-EEA records" are defined for domains and records not associated with EEA registrants.

### Methodology

#### A. WHOIS Data Collection
Our study aims to assess at scale whether WHOIS providers comply with the GDPR, particularly the ICANN Temporary Specification. We also seek to understand how data protection is enforced. Answering these research questions is non-trivial due to the unstructured nature of WHOIS data and the variety of data redaction methods. In this section, we detail our methodology for WHOIS data collection and GDPR compliance analysis (i.e., GCChecker). Figure 2 provides an overview of the key steps.

We aim to provide a longitudinal (before and after the GDPR effective date) and latitudinal (covering a wide range of WHOIS providers) view of the GDPR's impact on domain registration. To achieve this, we collaborated with an internet security company and leveraged its historical WHOIS dataset. The company maintains a passive DNS service (similar to Farsight DNSDB [48]) for threat hunting, which aggregates DNS requests and responses logged by affiliated DNS resolvers across regions. When a new domain name is observed (i.e., queried by an internet user), the system attempts to fetch its WHOIS record. For domain names under TLDs using the "thin WHOIS" model (e.g., .com, .net, and .jobs), WHOIS records are collected from registrars. For other TLDs, WHOIS records are collected from registries. Occasionally, the system re-fetches WHOIS records to obtain updates, such as when domains are about to expire. The WHOIS data collection system has been operational since 2016, and we use data spanning from January 2018 to December 2019 (two years).

**Parsing WHOIS Records:**
The standard WHOIS document [40] specifies only its transport mechanisms, but in practice, providers do not agree on the format of WHOIS records [34]. This lack of consensus hampers large-scale analysis, especially for TLDs adopting the "thin WHOIS" model. To address this, open-source and commercial WHOIS parsers have proposed template-based (e.g., Ruby Whois [10]), rule-based (e.g., pythonwhois [17]), and statistical approaches (e.g., [70]). Our industrial partner uses a template-based method, creating hundreds of WHOIS templates for different providers, which are regularly reviewed to accommodate format changes. Figure 3(a) shows a snippet of a parsed WHOIS record.

Based on our definitions of (non-)EEA records (in Section II), a WHOIS record is identified as a (non-)EEA record if its registrant country is one of the (non-)EEA countries. The ICANN Temporary Specification does not suggest redacting registrant country information, and empirical analysis indicates that most WHOIS providers follow this rule. Before proceeding, we remove all WHOIS records without registrant country information (e.g., due to redaction or format errors, which cover around 12.7% of records).

Table II presents the statistics of our parsed WHOIS dataset after removing records without registrant country information. The dataset contains 1.2 billion WHOIS records of 267 million domain names, including both newly-registered and older domains (e.g., 13% created before 2010). Approximately 12% of the domains are EEA domains, and over 67% of the records are collected from registrar WHOIS servers.

**Limitations:**
Our industrial partner collects WHOIS records of domains observed in its passive DNS dataset, which might be biased due to the geographic location of the affiliated resolvers. While acknowledging this limitation, our evaluation shows that the dataset has a satisfactory global coverage (219 countries and 12% EEA domains) and a wide range of TLDs (783 in total). We believe the results obtained from this dataset are representative. Another limitation is that the records are only collected from WHOIS servers via port 43. Web interfaces of providers are not examined, and there is a chance that WHOIS data is not sanitized there. However, web-based WHOIS services are often protected by CAPTCHA, preventing data collection [54], [64]. Therefore, we focus on port-43 WHOIS services.

#### B. GDPR Compliance Analysis
The primary goal of this study is to assess whether EEA records released by WHOIS providers follow the GDPR and ICANN Temporary Specification requirements. To this end, we analyze the degree of compliance for EEA records collected from each provider.

**Dataset for Empirical Analysis:**
We inspected a sample of 50 WHOIS providers (40 registrars and 10 registries) to gain insights into their WHOIS data processing. The providers were selected based on their share of registered domains (see Appendix A, accounting for over 50% of the total share) and having a large number of EEA records (over 1,000 records collected per month). For each provider, we randomly sampled 1,000 EEA records collected in December 2019 (50,000 records in total) and manually labeled each record based on whether its contact information (all fields listed in Table I) was protected. This dataset (termed DG) serves as the ground truth for our system design.

Among the 50,000 records in DG, 5,647 (11.3%) were labeled as unprotected. Figure 4 shows the cumulative distribution of the 50 providers' ratio of unprotected records in DG. We found a knee around 5% unprotected records, with 84% (42 out of 50) providers having a lower ratio, indicating clear data protection measures in their released records. This observation is used to assign three compliance levels to WHOIS providers (described in Step IV).

**Technical Challenge:**
The ICANN Temporary Specification does not strictly require the use of specific wording for redacted fields; it asks for values substantially similar to "redacted for privacy." From DG, we found redacted fields under different wording and languages, complicating automated textual analysis. Examples include:
- "privacidad WHOIS" (in Spanish)
- "obfuscated WHOIS"
- "statutory masking enabled"

This makes it challenging to determine if a WHOIS field is redacted under the GDPR, as simple keyword matching can lead to high error rates.

**Insight on WHOIS Textual Similarity:**
While scanning individual WHOIS records for compliance is error-prone and time-consuming, we found that by computing the statistical distribution of WHOIS record values per provider, we can assess GDPR compliance and the level of compliance. Our key observation from DG is that GDPR-compliant WHOIS providers prefer simple and automated approaches to replace record values at scale, resulting in high homogeneity, especially for EEA domains. Otherwise, the values would be diverse, reflecting different registrants. Consequently, redacted records should form large clusters with zero or a small number of outliers. Figure 5 illustrates this insight, where each dot represents a vectorized WHOIS record. Inspired by this, we use clustering algorithms and outlier ratios as indicators of GDPR compliance. This approach generally works well, though sometimes a domain holder can register a bulk of domains, forming a cluster. We apply a lightweight NLP-based approach to filter such clusters (described in Step III). Based on this insight, we designed GCChecker, which includes the following steps:

**Step I: Grouping WHOIS Records:**
We first group WHOIS records by their providers. For registry providers, we group them by their WHOIS servers. For registrar providers, we group them by their registrar IDs. Each accredited registrar is assigned a unique numerical ID [18], included in every WHOIS record (see Figure 3, field "iana_id"). We also remove records under drop-catch registrars (e.g., ID-17565 DropCatch.com LLC and ID-1008 SnapNames, LLC) because they often fill WHOIS records with similar values (e.g., "domain on sale") without any relation to a real registrant.

Next, we separate each group by time windows (e.g., weeks) to study changing dynamics. Within each window, WHOIS records are further grouped by registrants' regions (EEA and non-EEA) and data subjects (registrant, admin, and tech contacts). Each WHOIS record is associated with a main key, and records under different keys are analyzed separately. The main key is a quadruple:
- (provider, registrant region, data subject, time window)

Under a main key, we only fill relevant fields to the embedded data subject. Note that in each time window, we use the "current" version of WHOIS records to identify their registrant region and provider. This ensures the system is not affected by domain ownership changes (e.g., domain transfers).

**Step II: Preprocessing Field Values:**
Before clustering WHOIS records and assessing their homogeneity, we preprocess the fields to make clustering more efficient and effective. Specifically, we concatenate the values of fields that should be masked (e.g., registrant name, phone, and email, listed in Table I) using tab characters to produce a single string and convert it to lowercase. Figure 3(b) shows an example of the output string, which we call the WHOIS string. If the value is missing, we leave it as an empty string.
