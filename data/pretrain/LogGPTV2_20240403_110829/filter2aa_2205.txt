Agenda
• Standards and Requirements
• Electro-Mechanical Locks
• Critical Infrastructure and
Vulnerabilities
• Real World Threats
• Case Study: Electronic
Access Control technology
Standards:
Mechanical Locks
• Why we need Standards
• What They Measure
• Limited Protocol - Few Tests
• Exclude many “Real World Attacks”
– Bumping
– Mechanical Bypass
– Knowledgeable and Special Attack
Techniques - Not Contemplated
Security Criteria:
Standards
• Define Conventional vs. High
Security
• Threat Criteria
– Forced Entry
– Covert Entry
– Key Security
• All Standards based upon
– Time, Tools and Training
Forced Entry
UL437 and BHMA 156.30
• Locks must be secure against
Forced methods of Attack
• Attack Resistance 5 Minutes
• Excludes many methods of
attack
Covert Entry
Protection
• Minimum Security Criteria in
UL437 and ANSI/BHMA 156.30
• Protects against Certain forms
of Covert Entry
• Assures Minimum resistance to
opening
– (10 - 15 minutes)
– Picking and Decoding
– Master Key Attacks
– Bumping (Not Covered)
Key Security
• Organizational Protection
– Duplication of Keys
– Keys Ordered by Code
• Legal Protection
– Availability of Blanks
• Does not address Technical
Security of Keys
• Standards = Limited Security
Categories of Locks
• Conventional Mechanical Locks
• High Security Mechanical
Locks
• Electronic Credentials
– Electro-Mechanical Locks
– Electronic Locks
– Wired, Wireless, Data on Card
Critical Questions
• What is SECURITY re: Locks?
• Is it secure enough?
• What does a High Security rating
mean?
• The concept of key control, key
security and why it’s important
• Can the lock be compromised and
how difficult is it?
• Real World Threats
• Methods to Compromise
   Conventional Lock
Functions
• Restrict “WHO” can enter
• Prevent or Delay
Unauthorized Access
– Low to Medium security
– Not Certified
– Covert Entry often is easy
Conventional Lock
Vulnerabilities
• Picking, Bumping, Decoding
• Impressioning
• Master Key Extrapolation
• Mechanical Bypass
• Failure of Key Control
– Duplication of keys
– Simulation of Keys
– Replication of Keys
Conventional Locks:
Adequate for critical
applications?
• No tracking of access,
attempts, how often or when
• Add or Duplicate keys
• Key Security
• Master Key System Insecurity
• No evidence of Breach
• No Intelligence in lock or
key
Conventional v.
High Security
Mechanical
• Conventional Cylinders
– Easy to Pick or Bump open
– No Key Control
– Limited Forced Entry resistance
• High Security Cylinders
– UL and BHMA/ANSI Standards
• UL-437 and BHMA/ANSI 156.30
– Higher quality and tolerances
– Resistance to Forced and Covert Entry
– Key Control
High Security
Increased Protection?
• Protect high value targets
• Stringent security requirements
• Standards (UL and BHMA/ANSI)
• Threat Level is higher
• Minimum security criteria
– Attack times and resistance
– More difficult to compromise
– Higher key control
High Security
Critical Differences
• Multiple security layers
• More than one point of failure
• Each security layer is independent
• Security layers operate in parallel
• Difficult to bypass each layer
• Difficult to derive intelligence about
a layer
• Difficult to simulate the action of a
key
Mechanical Locks:
Design Limitations
• Good for one person, one key
• No Key / User Tracking
• Addition of deletion of keys
to the system
• Lost stolen or copied keys
• Manipulation of keys (Mul-T-
Lock and key interchange
issues)
Electronic Locks:
The Security Solution?
Electro-Mechanical
Locks
• Mechanical Locks +
Electronic Credentials
– STILL Mechanical Locks
• Two Parallel Locking Systems
– Mechanically keyed alike
– Mechanically master-keyed
– Key bitting assigned to each
customer
Electronic Access
Control Systems
• Mechanical lock designs
• Electronic Credentials
– I-button, RFID, SmartCard
– Many different protocols
• Security Layers
– Protocol
– Mechanical locking system
– Audit Functions
– Key Security

– Physical Access and Attempts
Critical
Infrastructure
Protection
• CIP-006-1:
The Physical Security Plan must:
“Contain procedures for
identifying, controlling and
monitoring all access points and
authorization requests.”
“Logging of Physical Access must
occur at all times and the
information logged must be
sufficient to uniquely identify
individuals”
Financial Data
• Sarbanes Oxley Act (2002)
– Financial Reporting for Public
Corporations
– Quality of Financial Reporting
– IT and Internal Controls
– Data Center Access Security
Financial Data
Integrity and Security
• Control and Safeguard Data
• Validity of Financial Reports
• Physical Control of Access to
Information
– Data Protection
– Theft
– Manipulation or Exploitation
– Unauthorized Access
Data Center Security
• Must Control Physical Access
to servers to Protect Data
• Electronic Access
– Passwords, Firewalls, IPS,
Encryption
Physical Access = Game Over
Real World Threats
• High Security Locks
• Electronic Access Control
Systems
– Total Compromise
– False Sense of Security
– Liability?
2007-2008:

Medeco locks, including a
total failure of Key Control
2007-2008

– Entire System at Risk
– Cannot Re-Key some Cylinders
• Simulate Credentials
• Bypass ALL Audit Functions
SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUES:
Audit Trail
• False Sense of Security
• Ability to bypass
• Potential for False Blame
• No Evidence of Entry
• Total Lack of “Chain of
Custody”
EAC Vulnerabilities
• Bypass of Mechanical or
Electronic System
• Audit trail Depends on
Reading the Key
What Happens if one Layer is
Bypassed?
Magnetic Attacks
Ulmann  Zacher
Cliq and Logic
Security Issues: Keys
• Mechanical Keys
• Wafer or Pin Tumbler Systems
• Often “Keyed Alike” Systems
– Keys Only cut at Factory
– Electronic Technology inside Key
• Mul-T-Lock results of Keyed
Alike and Key Duplication
Cliq and Logic
Simulated Credentials
• Possess Key and Simulate or
Bypass Credentials
One Lost Key in Key Alike
system
 =
Total Compromise of System!
Mul-T-Lock Click and
Magnets
Invisible Access
Audit Trail Bypass
• Audit trail is dependent
upon reading the Lock or Key
• If there is NO Audit Trail:
– False Sense of Security
– False Blame
– Unknown Compromise
– No Evidence of Entry

From Medeco:
“Unauthorized Key Copying is
removed from the Equation”
“Superior Protection against
Unauthorized Key Copying”

DEFECTS: MEDECO
“But that doesn't tell you what to do if
you've got a potentially vulnerable
Medeco lock. Don't count on Medeco to
replace it: "When you buy a lock, you
don't buy a subscription," Roberson
told me. Instead, he counseled, people
should visit experts and determine their
security needs.”
(Slate.com 5/23/2008)
STATEMENTS: SECURITY
ENGINEERING ISSUES
• MUL-T-LOCK
• “You have misrepresented that Mul-T-
Lock's policy is not to consider
replacing or repairing a product which
proves to be defective in normal use.
This is a gross misrepresentation and
not true.”
•   (7/31/2009)
   STATEMENTS:
SECURITY ENGINEERING
ISSUES
ASSA ABLOY:
“All of your accusations and
unreasonable demands seem to stem
from your mistaken or feigned belief
that because a product may under
certain limited circumstances be
susceptible to a new form of attack. it is
somehow rendered "defective.“
(5/15/2009)
  DEFECITVE PRODUCT AND
SECURITY ENGINEERING
• QUESTIONS:
• Mechanical defects v. Security defects:
is there a difference?
• Should a manufacturer be liable for
defective security engineering if it is not
a state of the art attack and should
have been foreseen?
MUL-T-LOCK CLIQ
MUL-T-LOCK CLIQ:
ADVERTISING
“In a world increasingly challenged my
mounting security threats, the need for
comprehensive locking systems has
become an essential requirement in
virtually every conceivable market
sector.”
 STATEMENTS BY
MUL-T-LOCK
“Each interactive Cliq key contains a
unique electronic ID code. It is
designated for one individual only, and
cannot be duplicated, altered, or
corrupted. “
“If the key is not authorized, the
mechanical element in the locking
system will simply remain locked.”
MUL-T-LOCK CLIQ
SECURITY
“Intreractive Cliq: unprecedented
benefits. The dual patent-protected
technologies employed in interactive
Cliq represent a truly successful
marriage of electrical and mechanical
locking systems offering a double layer
of impenetrable security.”
MUL-T-LOCK CLIQ:
AUDIT TRAIL
“Audit trail control is an absolute necessity if
you hope to keep tabs on the efficacy of
your locking network…. Interactive Cliq’s
control key enables you to easily access
precise data from every cylinder in your
facility…each key is designated for use by
one individual only. If the key is lost, it is
simply made obsolete…This enables total
control of every key issued to personnel. “
MUL-T-LOCK CLIQ
SECURITY
“Interactive Cliq: launching electro-
mechanical locking systems to the
ultimate level of security.”
