Formally, a network is a collection of points and

This is an abstraction which can be used to
describe a lot of different systems (technical,
physical, biological, sociological, etc. etc.).

Kleinberg’s Model
For searching to be possible, vertices need to have
locations, and whether u ↔ v should depend on the
distance between them (d(u,v)).

Let P(x ↔ w) ∝ 1/d(x,w)α, where d(x,w) is the
distance between them.

Route using greedy routing: step to the neighbor
which is closest to destination.

Kleinberg’s Model, cont.
Efﬁcient routing is possible when α is such that:
P(x ; w) ∝
1
# nodes closer to x than w
This can be seen to be α = d, where d is the dimension
of the space (2 in the simulations).

Why should one expect real-world networks to

Consider only the relative size of the ﬁrst k

Consider only the relative size of the ﬁrst k
numbers drawn.
These have a random order: each is equally likely
to be the biggest of them.
Thus the k-th number has probability 1/k of being
the biggest one yet.

generating searchable graphs.
Let u associate with each other node v a random
quantity representing u’s interest in v.

Let u associate with each other node v a random
quantity representing u’s interest in v.
Let u ↔ v if u is more interesting to v than any node
which is closer.

Interest Model
It follows that
P(u ↔ v) =
1
1+# nodes closer to u than v
This is now independent for each v.

P(u ↔ v) =

Expected number of shortcuts from each node is
logn.

One can see that greedy routing takes O(logn)
steps on a graph generated like this.

A Proof
If d is the distance between u and v, the yellow disk
is the vertices within (3/2)d of u and the green
within d/2 of v.

A Proof
If d is the distance between u and v, the yellow disk
is the vertices within (3/2)d of u and the green
within d/2 of v.
u must have a shortcut to the very “most
interesting” vertex in the yellow disk.

A Proof
If d is the distance between u and v, the yellow disk
is the vertices within (3/2)d of u and the green
within d/2 of v.
u must have a shortcut to the very “most
interesting” vertex in the yellow disk.
The probability that that vertex is in the green part
is 1/9.

The above model is still not very realistic. For
example, u’s interest in v and v’s interest in u are
not likely to be independent.

The Double Clustering Graph
Deﬁnition 1 Let (xi)n
i=1 and (yi)n
i=1 be two sequences of
points without repetition in possibly different spaces M1
and M2 with distance functions d1 and d2 respectively.
The digraph G = (V,E) is constructed as follows:
V = {1,2,...,n}.
(i, j) ∈ E if for all k ∈ V, k ̸= i, j:
d1(xi,xk) < d1(xi,x j) ⇒ d2(yi,yk) ≥ d2(yi,y j)
(Make undirected by removing directionality of the
edges.)

Conclusion
Simple probabilistic models can explain
complicated network structures.
Finding such models can help with both network
analysis and design.
It involves a lot of interesting mathematics.
