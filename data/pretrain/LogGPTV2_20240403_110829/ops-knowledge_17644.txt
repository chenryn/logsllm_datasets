Question: "Your team is tasked with developing a new authentication service. To ensure the security of the authentication process, you must choose an appropriate cryptographic algorithm. What would be an appropriate justification for deliberately choosing a slightly less secure algorithm over the most secure option available?"
 "A": "The less secure algorithm has a well-documented history of vulnerabilities, making it easier for the development team to anticipate potential attacks."
 "B": "The most secure algorithm requires computational resources that would significantly degrade the performance for the majority of users."
 "C": "The less secure algorithm is newer and less tested, potentially providing security through obscurity as attackers are less familiar with it."
 "D": "The most secure algorithm is not compliant with the company's outdated hardware, which cannot be updated due to budget constraints."
