User: I'm trying to build a small process monitoring script on Windows Server 2008.
The script would:

find target process
check status (running/unresponsive/stopped)
kill and restart process if unresponsive/stopped


Any suggestion on the best way to implement this?
Assistant: Naming a process 'unresponsive' is quite subjective. It might be waiting for data and seem unresponsive, or it might be in a (endless) loop and seem unresponsive.
Usually, what people do is implement hartbeat. That is - have a very tiny socket server in the process where other processes can connect and send ping messages, to which it replies pong. What monitoring tools usually do is ping the process periodically, and if it doesn't respond within a timeout - it's considered unresponsive (and usually gets killed).
