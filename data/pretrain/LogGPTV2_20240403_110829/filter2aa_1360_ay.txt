### Tire Columns and Menu Items
- The data between tire columns identifies the menu items visible on the left side of the page, which are considered the first column within the table.
- This line marks the end of each script.
- This creates a form to generate the URL, searching for a specific value.
- This creates the Submit button with specific text, inserts a new line, and closes the form.
- This line indicates the end of the "table", "body", and "HTML" sections, and closes the page.

### Inspecting Elements and Network Traffic
1. Right-click on the page and choose "Inspect Element."
2. Click the "Network" tab in the new window at the bottom of the page.
3. Type an email address into the website and execute the search.
4. Scroll through the new text in the Inspector window at the bottom of the page.
5. Click on the result displaying the target email address with "xhr" in the "Cause" column.
6. Copy the URL in the window to the right under "Headers" as seen in Figure 8.04.

### Using haveibeenpwned.com
- Navigate to haveibeenpwned.com using Firefox and allow the page to load.
- Follow these steps to identify the exact URL that submits a query to return data about your target:
  - This method represents the first search option within this tool, but it is quite powerful. It collects a target email address and queries the Have I Been Pwned website to identify known data breaches containing this account.
  - This technique will be explained in more detail later in the Email chapter.
  - This also demonstrates the need for a search tool versus simply visiting the search site. If you go to haveibeenpwned.com and enter an email address, the resulting page does not include a static URL for that search. The page with your results still has a simplified address of haveibeenpwned.com, and not something static like haveibeenpwned.com/test@email.com. Bookmarking this page would not present the search results you just achieved.
  - This is why a different static address, such as https://haveibeenpwned.com/unifiedsearch/test@email.com, is used. It presents the same content but in a text-only format.

### Custom Search Tools
- This creates a form input identified as `SearchOl` with "Email Address" populated in the field.
- Conducting the search on the official site presents a graphical output similar to Figure 8.02. However, the static address mentioned above presents a view from the Have I Been Pwned API, as seen in Figure 8.03. The same data can be found in both, but the text view can be copied and pasted more easily and possesses a static URL that can be referenced in reports and recreated later.
- This URL is not advertised on the site and is not an official option within the API (which is now a paid service, but this URL is free). This is the subject of our next tutorial.

### Adding New Search Options
- In each of the tools, the individual search options are replicated within one single "Submit All" feature. If you modify a search tool within the code, you should also update it under the final option to execute all queries.
- If you feel overwhelmed, do not panic. Your custom offline search tools are already configured and functioning. If a specific desired tool stops functioning, you can use this chapter to change your scripts.
- For example, if you found a website at emailleaks.com and want to add it to the tools, you would follow these steps:
  - Change the target URL, the `Search26` identifiers, and the descriptor.
  - You can place this section anywhere within the tools, as it does not need to be at the end. Note that it is titled `Search26`, so any new options added would need to start with `Search27`. These numbers do not need to be sequential throughout the tool, but they must be unique.

### Using the "Submit All" Feature
- Many online search tools offer a "Submit All" button at the bottom of the options. This executes each of the queries listed above the button and can save a lot of time.
- If you open one of the search tools with this option in a text editor, you will see the code for this at the bottom. It appears very similar to the other search options, but there are multiple `window.open` elements.

### Handling Pop-up Blockers
- To prevent your pop-up blocker from blocking specific pages, follow these steps:
  1. Open the `Email.html` search tool included in your downloaded offline search tools.
  2. Place any email address in the last option and press the "Submit All" button.
  3. A new tab will open; close it.
  4. Back in the Email search tool, you should see a yellow banner at the top.
  5. Click the Preferences button and click the first option to "Allow pop-ups for file."

### Accessing the Tools
- There are several files within the Tools folder. Launching any of these opens that specific tool, such as `Email.html`, but a menu exists within each of the pages to navigate to the desired page.
- The file titled `index.html` is the "Main menu," and it might be appropriate to set as your browser's home page. Clicking on the desired search option within the left side of the menu opens that specific tool.
- For example, clicking on "Twitter" presents numerous Twitter search options. These will each be explained at the end of each corresponding chapter.

### Additional Access Option
- An additional option for accessing these tools is available on my website. I will keep a live copy on my website within the following link:

### License and Warranty
- These tools are released to you for free. Full details of allowances and restrictions can be found in the "License.txt" file and "License" link within the tools download. The tools are provided "as is," without warranty.
