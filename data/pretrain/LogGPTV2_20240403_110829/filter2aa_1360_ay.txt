tire first column within the table.
This identifies the end of each script.
This creates a form to generate the URL, looking for a specific value.
This creates the Submit button with specific text inside, inserts a new line, and closes the form.
This identifies the end of the "table", "body", and "HTML" sections, and closes the page.
• 
Right-click on the page and choose "Inspect Element".
• 
Click the "Network" tab in the new window at the bottom of the page.
• 
Type an email address into the website and execute the search.
• 
Scroll through die new text in the Inspector window at the bottom of the page.
• 
Click on the result displaying the target email address with "xhr" in the "Cause" column.
• 
Copy the URL in the window to the right under "Headers" as seen in Figure 8.04.
Navigate to haveibeenpwned.com within Firefox and allow the page to load. Conduct the following steps to 
identify the exact URL which submits a query to return data about your target.
This only represents the first search option within this tool, but it is quite powerful. This collects a target email 
address and queries the website Have I Been Pwned to identify known data breaches containing this account. 
This technique will be explained in more detail later in the Email chapter. This also demonstrates the need for 
a search tool versus simply visiting the search site. If you go to haveibeenpwned.com, you can enter an email 
address to conduct your search. The new page presented does not include a static URL for that search. The page 
with your results still possesses a simplified address of haveibeenpwned.com, and not something static and 
similar to haveibeenpwned.com/test@email.com. Bookmarking this page would not present the search results 
which you have just achieved. This is why I am using a different static address of 
https://haveibeenpwned.eom/unifiedsearch/test@email.com. It presents the same content, but is a text-only 
format. Below is another example to explain this.

This creates a form input identified as SearchOl with "Email Address" populated in the field.
Conducting the search on the official site presents a graphical output similar to that seen in Figure 8.02. 
However, the static address I just mentioned presents a view from the Have I Been Pwned API, as seen in 
Figure 8.03. The same data can be found in each offering, but the text view can be copied and pasted more 
easily. It also possesses a static URL which can be referenced in your report and recreated later. You may be 
wondering where this URL came from. It is not advertised on the site, and is not an official option within the 
API (which is now a paid service, but tliis URL is free). That is our next tutorial.

script possesses an identifier similar to "SearchOI", "Search02", "Search03", etc. These must each be unique in 
order to function. You will notice that the final option (after the Submit All feature) is "Search25". We now 
know that our next option should be "Search26". Assume that you found a website at emailleaks.com and you 
want to add it to the tools. A query of an email address presents a URL as follows.
In each of the tools, I have simply replicated the individual search options within one single "Submit All" feature. 
If you modify a search tool within the code next to the manual search, you should also update it under the final 
option to execute all queries. If you feel overwhelmed with all of this, do not panic. None of this is required at 
this point Your own custom offline search tools are already configured and functioning. If a specific 
desired tool stops functioning, you can use this chapter to change your scripts.
All we changed within this copy and paste job was the target URL, the Search26 identifiers, and the descriptor. 
You can place this section anywhere within the tools, as it does not need to be at the end. Note it is titled 
Search26, so any new options added would need to start with Search27. These numbers do not need to be 
sequential throughout the tool, but they must be unique.
Many of the online search tools offer a "Submit All" button at the bottom of the options. This executes each of 
the queries referenced above the button and can be a huge time saver. If you open one of the search tools with 
this option in a text editor, you will see the code for this at the bottom. It appears very similar to the other search 
options, but there are multiple "window.open" elements such as those listed below.
I am sure some readers are frustrated at the technology presented here. Some may look at this code and cite 
numerous ways it could be made better. I agree this is amateur hour, as I am not a strong HTML coder. Other 
readers may be confused at all of this. For those, there are two options which simplify' things. First, ignore diis 
entire chapter and simply use the free tools without any modification. Some options will break eventually as sites 
come and go, but that should not impact the other fields. Second, don't worry too much about adding new
You may have noticed that there are several files within the Tools folder. Launching any of these opens that 
specific tool, such as "Email.html", but a menu exists within each of the pages in order to navigate within the 
tool to the desired page. The file tided "index.html" is the "Main menu", and might be appropriate to set as your 
browser’s home page. Clicking on the desired search option within the left side of the menu opens that specific 
tool. As an example, clicking on "Twitter" presents numerous Twitter search options. These will each be 
explained at the end of each corresponding chapter.

features. Instead, simply replace any searches that stop functioning. If Dehashed shuts down tomorrow, simply 
wait for a replacement. When that happens, modify only the URL and name, leaving the structure as-is.
You have a strong start with the current tools template. Very minimal modifications as things break will keep 
you in good shape. Any major updates which I perform to my own set of tools will be offered on my site for 
download. Check the "Updates" section at the following page.
• 
Click the Firefox menu in the upper right and choose Preferences or Options.
• 
Click on Privacy & Security and scroll to Permissions.
• 
If desired, uncheck the "Block pop-up windows" option.
While 1 would never do this on my primary browser used for personal activity on my main computer, I have 
disabled the pop-up blocker within my OSINT Original VM (and therefore all clones). It simply saves me 
headaches when trying to use automated tools. If only using the single queries within the tool, your pop-up 
blocker will not interfere. I highly recommend that you become familiar with these search tools before you rely 
on them. Experience how the URLs are formed, and understand how to modify them if needed. Each of these 
tools will be explained in the following chapters as we learn all of the functions.
These tools are released to you for free. Full details of allowances and restrictions can be found in the 
"License.txt" file and "License" link within the tools download. The tools are provided "as is", without warranty
This will prevent your pop-up blocker from blocking that specific page. You would need to repeat the process 
for each of the other tools, such as Twitter, Facebook, etc., which can be quite a burden. If desired, you can 
disable the pop-up blocker completely, but that carries risks. You may visit a malicious website which begins 
loading new tabs. I do not see this as much as in years past, but the threat does still exist If conducting your 
research within a VM, 1 do not see a huge risk in disabling this blocker. If you do, all of the tools will function 
without specific modifications to the blocker. Make this decision carefully.
You may have noticed that most of the tools have an option to populate all of the fields from a single entry. 
This is beneficial as it prevents us from copying and pasting target data within multiple fields. This code, which 
was presented earlier, tells your browser to populate anything you place into the first field within every field on 
that page which has an ID of "Search" plus any numbers. In other words, it would populate both examples on 
the previous page because they have "id=Search25" and id="Search26". Test this within the Email search tool. 
Make sure each "id" field is unique, as no two can be the same on one page.
When I need to search a specific target, I do not copy the data into each search field and press the corresponding 
button for each service. I place the input directly into the "Populate All'* option and then execute any individual 
searches desired. Alternatively, I place my target data into the "Submit /Ml" option and let it go. If using Firefox, 
this will fail on the first attempt. This is because you have pop-ups blocked by default, and Firefox is trying to 
protect you from multiple new pages loading automatically. The following steps will prevent this.
• 
Open the Email.html search tool included in your downloaded offline search tools.
• 
Place any email address in the last option and press the Submit All button.
• 
A new tab will open, but close it.
• 
Back in the Email search tool, you should see a yellow banner at the top.
• 
Click the Preferences button and click the first option to "Allow pop-ups for file".
