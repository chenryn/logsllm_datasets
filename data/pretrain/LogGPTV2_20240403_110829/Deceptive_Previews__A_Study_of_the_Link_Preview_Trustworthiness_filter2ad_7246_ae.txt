**Table VII: Summary of the Evaluation of Our Attacks**

- **N**: The attacker can change a field via HTML tags.

### Crafting Fields

We evaluate the replacement of preview fields using two types of attacker models:

1. **Web Page Control Attacker**:
   - This attacker can create and upload malicious web pages to a server, exploiting vulnerabilities in existing servers or web applications.
   - They can modify the title, description, and images by storing selected values in meta tags or standard HTML tags.
   - In Table VII, these fields are marked with "N".
   - However, they may not be able to alter the content of the domain name and the shared URL.

2. **Domain Registration Attacker**:
   - This attacker has the capabilities of the first type and can also register domain names.
   - This scenario models typical attackers who register fraudulent domain names to support their malicious activities.
   - Being able to register domain names allows them to craft the domain name and shared URL as well.

### Analysis of Field Manipulation

Based on our analysis, we grouped our results into five distinct classes based on observed behaviors:

1. **Link Previews without Domain Name**:
   - **Plurk**: Does not include any information regarding the landing page URL (neither the domain name nor the original URL).
   - **Instagram and Line**: Do not show the domain name but show the original URL. We could not find a way to remove or replace the shared URL from the preview.

2. **Replacing Domain Name using og:url**:
   - **Facebook**: When the shared webpage URL mismatches the `og:url` meta tag, the preview fields (title, image, description, and host) are retrieved from the URL specified in the `og:url` meta tag.
   - **Messenger**: Shows the same behavior as Facebook, but the shared URL cannot be removed from the message text.
   - **WhatsApp**: Replaces only the host field, showing the URL specified in the `og:url` meta tag. The shared URL cannot be removed from the message text.

3. **Removing Shared URLs in IMs**:
   - **Slack**: Allows editing of sent messages, including the URL string, effectively eliminating the URL from the rendered preview.
   - **Snapchat, Skype, and Viber**: Remove the URL from the message text after posting but include the domain name in the preview, which is extracted directly from the shared URL.

4. **Replacing Domain using og:site_name**:
   - **Xing, Telegram, and Slack**: Replace the domain name with the content of the `og:site_name` meta tag.
   - **Slack**: Allows removing the shared URL from the message text after posting.
   - **Xing**: Does not include the original URL, so controlling the web page content is sufficient to craft a URL preview.
   - **Telegram**: Includes the shared URL, making it more suitable for an attacker who can register domain names.

### Attacks

Our analysis shows that it is possible to create an attack against each platform. Four platforms (Facebook, Xing, Plurk, and Slack) can have entirely indistinguishable link previews by changing only the content of the malicious web page. For three of these platforms, the attacker needs to exploit specific behaviors. 

- **Facebook**: The attacker can replace the domain name with the `og:url` meta tag.
- **Xing and Slack**: The attacker can replace the domain name using the `og:site_name` tag. Slack also allows removing the original URL from the preview after creation.

### Bypassing Countermeasures

1. **Redirections**:
   - Most platforms do not support HTTP redirections, allowing client-side redirections to bypass URL validation. Twitter and LinkedIn were tested and confirmed to be vulnerable to this method.
   - Server-side redirections (30x response) can bypass LinkedIn's URL filtering, suggesting that LinkedIn does not validate the Location header of the HTTP response.

2. **Link Cloaking**:
   - Attackers can leverage unique source IP and user agent strings to deliver benign web pages for link preview creation and malicious pages otherwise.

### Discussion and Recommendations

#### Variety of Layouts and Processing Rules

- **Recommendation (R1)**: Standardize the content and construction rules of link previews to ensure consistency and reduce security risks.

#### Distrustful Scenario

- **Recommendation (R2)**: Link previews must include either the domain name or the shared URL.
- **Recommendation (R3)**: Limit edits of posts or refresh previews when the URL is changed.
- **Recommendation (R4)**: Create link previews using data items contained in the code of the landing page, and avoid using external links for the entire preview.
- **Recommendation (R5)**: Each field of a link preview should have a well-defined type, and platforms should not use the content of one field to fill another field of a different type.

#### Upstream vs Downstream URL Validation

- **Recommendation (R6)**: Perform upstream URL validation to detect and block malicious links before they are shared and clicked on by users.

By implementing these recommendations, social media platforms can enhance the security and reliability of link previews, reducing the risk of phishing and other malicious activities.
