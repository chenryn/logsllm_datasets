main name. For the purpose of this work, we focus on the primary
e-mail provider, which is identified by the MX record with the
highest priority. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of this approach
using randomly sampled domains from the three larger datasets
of domains on which we base much of our subsequent analysis
(described in detail in Section 4.3).
3.1 Challenges in Provider Identification
One approach, exemplified by Trost’s analysis [36], relies exclu-
sively on MX records to identify the mail provider. However, this
approach can be misleading when the purported MX domain re-
solves to an IP address operated by a different entity.
Better accuracy can be achieved by incorporating additional
features, such as the autonomous system number (ASN) of the
IP address to which an MX record resolves, the content of Ban-
ner/EHLO messages in the initial SMTP transaction, and TLS cer-
tificates learned during an SMTP session. However, using multi-
ple features creates additional complexities. In particular, while
SMTP-level information is typically a more reliable indicator of

mail service provider than the hosting party’s ASN, the latter is
always available while the former is not.
To illustrate these points further, we use the four domains listed
in Tables 1 and 2 as examples. Table 1 shows the MX record, the
IP address resolution, and the ASN from which the address is an-
nounced. Table 2 shows additional information learned by initiating
SMTP sessions with the IP addresses listed in Table 1. Specifically,
we show the subject Common Name (CN) listed on the certificate
presented in STARTTLS (if any) and the Banner/EHLO messages
provided during the SMTP session.
3.1.1 MX Record. Using the MX record to infer the mail provider
works well when the domain owner explicitly names its provider
in the MX record (e.g., netflix.com in Table 1). This is a common
practice for domains that outsource their mail services to third-
party companies (e.g., Google) to ensure that their providers can
property receive e-mail on their behalf [28, 35].
However, this idiom is not always accurate. For example, the MX
approach will incorrectly infer that gsipartners.com self-hosts its
e-mail delivery because its MX record is mailhost.gsipartners.com.
However, this MX name resolves to an IP address announced by
Google. When contacted, it emits mx.google.com Banner/EHLO in
the SMTP handshake, and the TLS certificate it produces has a sub-
ject common name (CN) of mx.google.com. Clearly, gsipartners.com
e-mail is handled by Google.
3.1.2 Autonomous System Number (ASN). While the ASN to which
the mailhost.gsipartners.com MX leads correctly indicates Google
as the mail provider, this inference is not always accurate. Consider
the domain beats24-7.com whose MX record also resolves to an IP
address owned by Google. In this case e-mail is actually handled
by an e-mail security provider that is hosted in Google Cloud’s IP
space, rather than the internal address space used by Google to
host its own services. Another issue with the ASN is that it does
not reflect whether an IP address is actually operating an SMTP
server and can accept mail. Consider jeniustoto.net in Table 1,
which has an MX record that resolves to an IP address in Google’s
internal address space. However, this IP address is from Google’s
web hosting service and does not run an SMTP server. In this case,
jeniustoto.net does not actually have a mail server (and thus a
mail provider), even though it uses a Google IP address.
3.1.3 Banner/EHLO messages. During an SMTP session, the mail
server for gsipartners.com identifies itself in its Banner/EHLO
handshake as mx.google.com (Table 2). This information is gen-
erally reliable for identifying third-party mail providers, as most
third-party providers configure their servers to properly identify
themselves. However, the Banner/EHLO information need not be
mechanically generated and can contain any text configured by
the server operator, which makes it unreliable in a small number
of scenarios. First, Banner/EHLO messages may not contain valid
domain names. For example, instead of having a valid domain name,
certain providers put a string (e.g., IP-1-2-3-4) in their servers’
Banner/EHLO messages. Second, an individual, who runs their own
SMTP server, can falsely claim to be mx.google.com in Banner/EHLO
messages. While very rare, we have observed a small number of
such cases.
3.1.4 TLS certificate. The gsipartners.com mail server also presents
a valid certificate with subject CN mx.google.com, which is a clear
indicator of the entity running the mail server (and one attested to
by a trusted Certificate Authority) and thus can generally be used to
infer the mail provider. In the case of gsipartners.com, we conclude
that it uses Google as it presents a valid certificate with subject
CN mx.google.com (this certificate is also used by other legitimate
Google mail servers).
While certificates are ideal for identifying the mail provider
of a domain, they are not always available. Some mail servers
do not support STARTTLS or they respond with self-signed cer-
tificates which are less reliable. Additionally, we note that cer-
tain web hosting providers (e.g., GoDaddy with domain name
secureserver.net) allow their virtual private servers (VPS) to cre-
ate certificates using specific subdomains as the subject CN (e.g.,
vps123.secureserver.net). These servers are operated by individ-
uals renting them instead of the web hosting company provid-
ing the infrastructure. Thus, in this case, the subject CN reflects
the hosting provider (e.g., GoDaddy) instead of the mail provider
(e.g., a self-hosted mail server operated by an individual operating

3.2 Methodology: A Priority-Based Approach
We propose a methodology, which we term the priority-based ap-
proach, that takes as input a domain (and relevant information)
and outputs a provider ID as the inferred primary mail provider
responsible for mail service for that domain. Our methodology
incorporates data from multiple sources, including MX records,
Banner/EHLO messages, and TLS certificates. We achieve high ac-
curacy through prioritizing these sources by reliability: certificates
first, then Banner/EHLO messages, and then MX records.
Our methodology consists of five steps shown in Figure 3. First,
we preprocess all certificates to find and group certificates that
are potentially operated by the same entity. For each group of
certificates, we designate a representative name to represent the
entity owning these certificates. Second, for each IP address that an
MX record resolves to, we try to determine IDs that best represent
the mail provider associated with that IP address. Since an MX
can resolve to multiple IP addresses, knowing the mail provider
operating each IP address is a prerequisite for determining the
provider ID of an MX. Next, we assign a provider ID to the MX
record. We then filter for misidentifications and correct them to
the best of our ability. Finally, we assign a provider ID to a domain,
which is a registered domain representing the entity operating the
mail infrastructure pointed by the MX record.
We detail our five step methodology below, using the exam-
ples shown in Table 3, in which domains third-party1.com and
third-party2.com use e-mail services provided by the third-party
provider provider.com, domain myvps.com operates its own e-mail
service on a VPS hosted with provider.com, and domain selfhosted.
com operates its own mail service.
3.2.1 Certificate Preprocessing. The goal of the first step — pre-
processing — is to find certificates that are potentially operated by
the same mail provider. The domains listed in a certificate aid our
mail provider inferences. However, certificates also introduce two
issues. First, a mail provider can have multiple valid certificates.
Additionally, each certificate can contain multiple domain names
by using the subject alternative name (SAN) extension. Having
multiple certificates, each with multiple domain names, leads to
two challenges: which certificates belong to the same mail provider,
and which name to use to represent that provider.
We address these two challenges by preprocessing all certifi-
cates in our dataset and grouping certificates that likely belong to
the same mail provider. We output a representative name for each
group to represent that group and the mail provider. The process
of grouping certificates and producing a representative name has
three steps:
(1) Count Occurrences of Each Registered Domain: For fully
qualified domain names (FQDNs) that appear on a certifi-
cate’s Subject CN and SANs, we take the registered domain
part (e.g., in Table 3 provider.com is the registered domain
of both mx1.provider.com and mx2.provider.com) and count
occurrences of each registered domain across all certificates.
For example, in Table 3, the count for provider.com will be
5. We extract the registered domain from the FQDN using
the Public Suffix List [21].
(2) Grouping Certificates: Providers may use different certifi-
cates across their infrastructure, and grouping consolidates

MX record. The approach considers data from MX records,
Banner/EHLO messages, and TLS certificates to determine
the e-mail provider.
a GoDaddy VPS). Lastly, in a handful of cases, we observe that
some third-party mail service providers present the certificates of
their customers. For example, the University of Texas (utexas.edu)
has an MX record (inbound.utexas.edu) that resolves to an IP ad-
dress that, when contacted, presents a valid certificate with CN
inbound.mail.utexas.edu. However, the ASN of that IP address sug-
gests that mail service is operated by Ironport, an e-mail security
company. Additionally, the server indicates in its Banner/EHLO
message that it is Ironport. In this case, we can conclude that the
University of Texas is using Ironport instead of hosting their own
e-mail infrastructure. Thus, the CN presented in the certificate does
not indicate the service provider in this instance.
Based on these observations and our experience, we propose an
approach that prioritizes SMTP level information when available,
and falls back to MX level information in other cases. This approach
achieves both good accuracy and avoids the availability issues with
SMTP level information. We provide more details below.

them into sets of related FQDNs. We put two certificates into
the same group if (and as long as) there is some degree of
overlap between their sets of FQDNs. For instance, in Table 3,
we would create two groups. We merge the certificates used
by third-party1.com and third-party2.com into one group,
as they contain the same set of FQDNs: mx1.provider.com
and mx2.provider.com. The certificate with subject CN myvps.
provider.com is in its own group.
(3) Selecting a Representative Name: For each group of cer-
tificates, we choose the most common registered domain as
the representative name, as it is likely to represent the mail
provider best. In our specific example, the representative
name for both groups is provider.com.
At the end of this process, certificates are organized into groups
and each group will have a representative name.
Identifying IDs for an IP Address. Before assigning a mail
3.2.2
provider ID to an MX record, we need to determine the ID(s) that
best represent(s) the mail provider for the IP address(es) to which
an MX record resolves. We compute one ID with certificates and
another ID with Banner/EHLO messages. We also prioritize the ID
computed with certificates when using both IDs.
(1) ID from TLS Certificates: If a valid certificate is present at
the IP address, we use the representative name of the group
containing the certificate as the ID. We consider a certificate
valid if it is trusted by a major browser (e.g., Firefox). In our
example, IP addresses 1.2.3.4, 2.3.4.5, 3.4.5.6 would have
the ID provider.com from certificates.
(2) ID from Banner/EHLO Messages: If the Banner/EHLO
message is available and contains a valid FQDN, we use the
registered domain part of the FQDN as the ID. In our example,
we cannot assign an ID to IP address 4.5.6.7 because it does
not present a certificate and its Banner/EHLO message does
not contain a valid FQDN. The other three IP addresses have
the ID provider.com from Banner/EHLO messages.
Identifying Mail Provider ID for an MX Record. Once we have
3.2.3
computed IDs for each IP address, we next analyze the MX records.
If all IP addresses of an MX record have the same ID from certificates,
we assign that ID as the provider ID to the MX record. In cases where
IDs from certificates do not agree or are not available, we check if
all IP addresses share the same ID from Banner/EHLO messages. If
so, we assign that provider ID to the MX record. Otherwise, we fall
back to using the registered domain part of the MX record as the
provider ID.
3.2.4 Checking for Misidentifications. While this approach can in-
fer the mail provider of an MX record correctly in most cases, there
127
exist a few that lead to misidentifications. In the above example,
for domain myvps.com, we infer that its MX record mx.myvps.com
