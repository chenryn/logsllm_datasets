User: Check the disk space usage of your Linux system and perform cleanup operations to free up disk space.
Assistant: 1. Check disk space usage: Use the command df -h to check the usage of all disks in the system, including the total disk capacity, used space, free space, and mount points. For example: $ df -h Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on /dev/sda1 20G 10G 9.4G 51% / devtmpfs 7.8G 0 7.8G 0% /dev tmpfs 7.8G 60K 7.8G 1% /dev/shm tmpfs 7.8G 9.0M 7.8G 1% /run tmpfs 7.8G 0 7.8G 0% /sys/fs/cgroup /dev/sdb1 7.8G 2.7G 4.8G 36% /data 2. Clean up system logs: there are A large number of system log files, which can take up a lot of disk space. You can use the command sudo du -sh /var/log to view the size of all files in this directory, and then select the files that need to be deleted or backed up to other locations. For example: $ sudo du -sh /var/log 2.6G /var/log $ sudo rm -rf /var/log/* 3. Clean up temporary files: use the command sudo rm -rf /tmp/* to delete the system temporary folder All files in to free up disk space. For example: $ sudo rm -rf /tmp/* 4. Clean software cache: There are many unnecessary software cache data in the /var/cache directory, which can be cleared by command sudo apt-get clean or sudo yum clean all clean up. For example: $ sudo apt-get clean or $ sudo yum clean all 5. Remove unnecessary packages: Sometimes we install some unnecessary software, which not only takes up disk space, but also makes the system bloated. Use the command sudo apt-get remove or sudo yum remove to remove these packages. For example: $ sudo apt-get remove apache2 or $ sudo yum remove httpd In short, you need to be careful when cleaning up the disk space of the Linux system to avoid deleting important files and directories by mistake, so please operate with caution!
