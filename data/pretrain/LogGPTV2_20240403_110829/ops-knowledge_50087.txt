Question: Consider an implementation of the AES-EMAC algorithm for message authentication. If the key \(K\) and message \(M\) are given as described in the AES-EMAC process, what steps will correctly result in the computation of the tag \(T\) for message \(M\), and what would likely occur if one of the steps is modified?
"A": "The message \(M\) is divided into 128-bit blocks and an initial state \(S_0 = 0\) is set. Then, each block is combined with the previous state and encrypted with key \(K_1\) to compute the sequence \(S_i\). Altering the initial state to a non-zero value might lead to an incorrect tag that cannot be verified.",
"B": "Two keys \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are derived from the main key \(K\). The final tag \(T\) is calculated by encrypting the last state \(S_n\) with \(K_1\), and modifying the key derivation process could result in a security breach allowing tag forgery.",
"C": "Each 128-bit block of the message \(M\) is directly encrypted with key \(K_2\) without the XOR operation with the previous state, and the final tag is the result of the encryption of the last block. Skipping the XOR step and using the wrong key may lead to predictable tags that can be forged.",
"D": "The message \(M\) is processed in blocks, XORed with a cumulative state encrypted by \(K_1\), and the final tag is produced by encrypting the cumulative state \(S_n\) with \(K_2\). Deviating from this block processing method could compromise the integrity of the tag, enabling an attacker to manipulate message authentication."
