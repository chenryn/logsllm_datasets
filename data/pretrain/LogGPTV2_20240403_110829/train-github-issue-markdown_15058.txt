Challenge http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-learn-how-script-tags-
and-document-ready-work has an issue.  
Each page of JQuery is starting with the phone blank, and the section where
the objectives are checked off doesn't appear (and pressing run makes no
difference). Running the correct code (I assume) to complete the objectives
doesn't change this. Deleting the script and pressing run allows the phone to
fill in and the objectives section to appear. The appearance of the phone
doesn't change once you add back the script and run again, but the objectives
disappear. In no case is feed back given upon pressing run.  
screen shots 1-3.
