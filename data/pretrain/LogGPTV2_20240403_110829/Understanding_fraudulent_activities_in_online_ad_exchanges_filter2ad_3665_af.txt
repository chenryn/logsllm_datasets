the  proposed 
countermeasures.  In  Section  5.1,  it  says  that  the  main  problem 
with ad exchanges is that they trust the information passed by the 
browser. This is not what I concluded from reading the paper up 
to  this  point;  I  concluded  that  the  main  problem  is  the  fact  that 
there  is  no  practical  way  to  tell  whether  an  impression/click  is 
initiated by an interested customer or a bot. I recommend that the 
authors  explain  exactly  which  of  the  attacks  that  they  describe 
could be solved through digital signatures. 
Reviewer #3 
Strengths:  Analysis  of  data  from  the  real  entities  gives  an 
interesting view of what kind of attack techniques are being used 
in  real  world  and  reveals  that  current  systems  still  have 
weaknesses. 
Weaknesses:  The  paper  is  read  more  like  a  survey  paper. 
Background  material  takes  half  of  the  paper,  spanning  7  pages.  
The  measurement  and  analytical  contribution  is  not  deep. 
Considering this is an early paper on understanding ad exchange, 
this might not be a show-stopper. 
Comments  to  Authors:  This  is  a  well  written  paper,  giving  an 
overview of ad exchange system.  Having said this, I would still 
suggest  to  shrink  the  background  section  somewhat  by  giving 
proper citation.  This will leave more space to explore technical 
results.  
Section  2.8,  how  do  you  compute  the  net  revenues  from 
impressions and clicks? 
They do not seems to agree with the number of impressions and 
clicks & CPMs given in the same paragraph. Also, why the CPM 
for the impression is higher than the cost-per-clicks? 
Section  3.2,  IP  threshold  values  seem  to  be  arbitrary.  Can  you 
explain how you determine these thresholds? 
Section  3.3,  it  is  unclear  how  the  authors  determined  the 
cookies/IPs 
  that  ‘consistently’  violated  the  thresholds.  In 
addition,  in  Table  3,  what  does  incident  and  incident  >  1  day 
mean? An incident seems to be different from a warning because 
the  number  of  incidents  does  not  agree  with  the  percentage  of 
warnings, but it is not clear what it actually is. 
Section  4.3,  the  authors  said  that  the  referrer  information  was 
suppressed by RightMedia. Since some of the referrer information 
was  present,  does  this  mean  only  some  of  the  referrers  were 
suppressed? 
this  selective 
suppression?

Strengths: - Novel data from real ad network.   
- Comprehensive background on ad. networks. 
Weaknesses:  -  Sloppy  writing.    Not  clear  what  the  take  home

Comments to Authors: The dataset analyzed here is interesting, 
but the paper is so poorly written that it is very difficult to follow 
the  many  different  contexts  and  subplots.    There  are  seemingly 
disjointed  pieces  that  are  very  difficult  to  piece  together  into  a 
coherent  story.    The  writing  is  verbose  at  parts:  going  into 
excruciating  detail  about  different  components,  and  confusing 
elsewhere: making it impossible to follow different examples. 
As  presented,  the  paper  is  not  ready  to  be  accepted.    The 
presentation  problems  make  it  difficult  to  assess  the  actual 
contribution.  A lot of the ‘analysis’ is tabulation of the data from 
‘NetworkX’.  There is one ‘significant’ result in that PublisherA 
was found to be fraudulent and banned.  It is not clear that there is 
enough  meat  in  the  analysis  to  merit  acceptance  even  if  the 
presentation was fixed. 
Detailed comments: 
Introduction: Ad exchange is not well defined.  Is it a single entity 
through which networks can exchange ad space, or is it a set of 
(connected?) entities? 
Advertiser:  whom do they pay?  Ad network or exchange? How 
does an advertiser create a relationship with an exchange? 
Ad network definition:  What is traffic in this context? What does 
it mean to buy and sell traffic? 
Arbitrage definition:  What does buying ‘impressions’ mean? 
Ad Exchange:  What does ‘publisher revenue’ mean? 
The Introduction implies that the authors could control a botnet. It 
should be clarified that the authors had access to the logs from a 
botnet C&C server. 
Section 2.1: eCPM “formula” is a heuristic/an estimate/expected 
return, not an exact formula. 
Figure 2 shows no Section ID 
Section  2.3:  “Seller  line  item  cascades  through  the  exchange”: 
what  does  this  mean?  The  example  in  the  rest  of  the  section  is 
simply  unparsable.  It  is  not  clear  what  the  process  is,  how  the 
auction  is  carried  out,  how  bids  are  evaluated...  What  is  the 
exchange?  Is it a real or virtual entity?  Is it a single server?  Are 
there  messages  sent  between  different  entities?    A  specific 
illustrated example should be part of the complete rewrite of this 
section. 
Section  2.4:    Requires  specific  example.  The  description  of  ad 
fraud  /attacks  is  good,  though  verbose.  Impression,  Click,  and 
Action spam can all be described in one paragraph, as can all the 
‘different’  types  of  clickbots.  It  is  not  clear  that  all  of  that 
terminology is required for the rest of the paper and analysis. 
Section  2.7:  Rule  and  classifier  based  detectors  don’t  need 
separate paragraphs.  
Auditing:  How does a referrer claim to have content? 
Section  2.8:  What  ‘roles’  do  botnet  owners  play?    Are  they 
advertisers?    Are  they  publishers?    The  attack(s)  are  entirely 
unclear:  did 
infected  user’s  browser  show  ‘infected’ 
the 
292information 
advertisements?    Was  the  user  machine  used  to  generate  clicks 
without the user involvement? 
The last paragraph on page 6 has to be rewritten.  As is, it does 
not  contain  sufficient 
to  understand  what  (if 
anything)  the  bots  are  doing.    The  last  line  implies  that  the 
fraudsters are publishers and the infected machines emulate clicks 
to these pages. Is this true? 
First line of page 7:  ...third party domains used to spoof origin. 
What does this mean?  What traffic? 
The entire discussion of the bot anatomy lacks structure.  There 
are disjointed sections with vague forward pointers.  It is not clear 
why the reader is being given this information or why they should 
be interested. 
Section 3.1 What is “our system”?  What was applied to the data 
feed? 
Cookie  ID:  is  NOT  assigned  to  a  person.  Perhaps  to  a  browser 
instance. 
Section 3.2:  CPM costs is per 1000 impressions?  Or are clicks 
cheaper than impressions? 
Section  3.3:  How  many  publishers  are  part  of  the  data?    Last 
sentence  does  not  parse.  What  is  the  motivation  for  botnets  to 
provide third-party referrer URLs with their own section ID?  To 
avoid detection? 
Section  4.1:  7%  of  Network  X’s  traffic  is  fraudulent  due  to  a 
single cookie?! This seems extremely negligent on part of the ad. 
network. 
Experiment in 4.3 does not make sense: the tcpdump shows that 
the referrer field WAS properly set.  In the data feed, the referrer 
feed was NOT set.  Why would it be fraudulent for publisher D to 
have set the referrer field for the impressions that were generated? 
Section  4.5  Where  did  the  botnet  host  its  fake  sites?    Were  the 
websites created only once when the section IDs were generated? 
Section  5:  The  countermeasures  are  not  described  well.  Who, 
should sign what, and what types of fraud such signatures would 
counter: all these points are not clear. 
From  the  text,  it  is  not  clear  when  site  names  are  changed  to 
protect the innocent (guilty) versus not, e.g. is benign-golf-site a 
real  site?  If  not,  why  is  the  name  in  terminal  font,  same  as 
pizzahut.com and googleusercontent.com? 
Reviewer #5 
Strengths:  The  tutorial  nature  of  presentation  should  make  the 
material  understandable  to  a  wide  audience.  The  paper  provides 
numerous interesting empirical examples of misuse of the Internet 
advertising  market.  Given  the  importance  of  advertising  to  the 
sustainability  of  the  Internet,  familiarizing  the  community  with 
the problems could lead to better solutions. 
Weaknesses:  The authors have published quite a few papers on 
the  topic  already;  thus,  the  novelty  of  this  work  is  unclear.  The 
paper  lacks  details  about  how  they  infiltrated  the  command  and 
control  server  of  the  botnet  they  used  to  collect  data,  and  how 
they  collected  the  measurements.  A  number  of  the  methods  for 
identifying malicious activity seem rather ad hoc. The clarity of 
presentation needs improvement (e.g., there are lots of figures and 
tables, but often little descriptive text to go with them). The paper 
cites little recent work besides their own. 
Comments  to  Authors:  I  enjoyed  reading  the  paper,  as  it 
provides  sufficient  background  information  for  a  reader  to learn 
about  the  Internet  advertising  market,  and  then  explains  the 
different categories of fraudulent activity in an intuitive manner, 
complete  with  examples.  I  think  it  could  be  significantly 
improved through revisions to the presentation. As mentioned in 
the “Weaknesses”, the paper needs to clarify what is novel about 
this  work  over  the  numerous  other  papers  you  have  published 
(and  are  cited  in  the  references).  Even  though  you  have  other 
papers  that  provide  details  about  how  the  command  and  control 
server was taken over, and how the measurements were collected, 
some  amount  of  that  information  needs  to  be  in  this  paper.  In 
general,  the  numerous  figures  and  tables  in  the  paper  are  not 
described in sufficient detail. You need to explicitly tell the reader 
about one or two of the key insights that are revealed in each (and 
how  to  see  them).  Lastly,  the  number  of  self-references is quite 
high compared to the references to other work. For example, the 
security group at UCSD has done a lot of related work, but I only 
see  one  of  their  papers  cited  (I  am  not  associated  with  that 
group/institute, I am only providing them as an example). 
Addressing the above issues would make the paper much stronger 
in my opinion. Here are some additional minor comments. 
Section 2.3: Please clarify how in practice an advertiser “trusts the 
publisher”; is there a technical element to it, or does it just come 
down 
to  making 
call  based  on  brand 
recognition/price/etc.? 
Section 2.7: In reverse spidering, it seems like there is potential 
for “crowdsourcing” to assist 
Section 2.8: Please clarify what happened to the botnet after the 
command  and  control  server  that  you  controlled  was  taken 
offline;  the  fact  that  the  botnet  continues  to  exist  seems  like 
another challenge to describe (in the last paragraph of the section) 
Section 2.9: Discuss the “arms race” that exists; i.e., if you deploy 
a barrier against miscreants, they will look for a way around it. 
Section 3.1: Clarify the period of time that the data was collected 
and who is assigning the cookies, and whether a single user can 
have more than one. 
Section  3.2:  For 
the 
impressions are to a single ad, or to multiple ads from the same 
provider, or something else 
Section  4.1:  The  discussion  of  “clicks  from  the  Cloud”  is 
interesting; one comment I have is that if someone is willing to 
commit fraud, I would expect they could use stolen credit cards to 
“pay” for resources, and not be limited to the “free” tier. 
Section 4.2: The discussion of the change in the behavior seems 
very speculative.

if 
293Section 4.3: A “404” error means the requested object (i.e., file) 
was not found, but a server of some sort was running. (my point is 
you  need  to  clarify  what  you  observed,  many  readers  may  not 
know what a “404” means). Please elaborate on the key insights 
from the tables. In the discussion of pizzahut.com, say it appeared 
in  “21”  different  sections  rather  than  “over  20”;  also,  is 
misconfiguration  a  possible  explanation  for  this  behavior,  rather 
than  malice?  i.e.,  an  unintentional  error  rather  than  intentional 
misuse? 
In Table 7, why are some domain names obscured but not all? 
The investigation described in the last paragraph seems rather ad 
hoc;  to  address  miscreants  effectively,  systematic  and  scalable 
solutions are needed 
Section 4.4. If PublisherA had been caught before, why wasn’t it 
banned earlier? 
Section  4.5.  How  did  you  determine  that  the  templates  were 
stolen from other sites? 
please briefly explain how Alexa determines its ranking 
Section  5.  This  section  needs  to  anticipate  how  miscreants  will 
react to these countermeasures, and thus how the countermeasures 
need  to  evolve  over  time.  How  difficult  will  the  proposed 
countermeasures be to circumvent? 
Section  5.1.  Please  clarify  why  would  signing  requests  would 
require  extra  bandwidth.  Also,  if  a  client  is  compromised,  what 
difference  will  extra  CPU  or  bandwidth  make  to  the  miscreant 
(other than they may need to find a few extra bots)? 
Section  5.2.  Rather  than  speculate  what  RightMedia  does,  why 
not ask them? 
Section  6.  As  previously  mentioned,  there  is  a  lot  of  other 
research out there; e.g., UCSD has infiltrated a C&C server for a 
spam  botnet.  Check  out  this  and  other  papers  from  Stefan 
Savage’s group. 
Response from the Authors 
The three prevailing comments from the reviewers were that our 
detection  methodology  was  not  well  defined  enough  to  be 
convincing, that our proposed countermeasures were limited, and 
that our figures were not well integrated into the paper. Of these, 
the primary cause of concern from the reviewers had to do with 
our  detection  methodology,  both  in  how  it  is  presented  and 
executed. To address concerns with the presentation, we chose to 
dedicate a larger portion of the paper to the detection methods and 
chose to introduce them less abruptly than in our submission. We 
first  introduce  our  detection  techniques  (in  Section  3),  then 
evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  each  technique  (Section  4),  and 
lastly we have observations about various types of fraud that were 
unearthed  as  a  result  of  using  the  detection  system  (Section  5). 
Organizing it like this fixes any confusion that came as a result of 
mixing  our descriptions and results. In addition, we had enough 
time  to  evaluate  each  detection  algorithm  in  detail  and  produce 
receiver  operator  characteristic  (ROC)  curves  to  compare  the 
effectiveness of each algorithm. From the curves, we were able to 
tune our detection system, evaluate new detection algorithms, and 
better justify our decisions to use a proposed detection technique. 
Then,  we  used  our  improved  detection  system  to  measure  how 
much fraud we detect in the exchange and how much revenue is 
being  lost,  as  suggested  by  one  of  the  reviewers.  Many  of  the 
reviewers 
“Proposed 
Countermeasures” section. Instead of expanding this section, we 
chose to replace it with a section that focused on what properties 
of RightMedia (and ad exchanges in general) make it conducive 
to fraud. We look at some of the problems that an individual ad 
network in the exchange runs into when they want to verify the 
legitimacy of their traffic. We also look at what RightMedia does 
correctly  to  deter  fraudsters.  Lastly,  a  few  reviewers  suggested 
changes to some of the figures, for example Figure 1, which was 
replaced  by  a  clearer  diagram  of  how  the  ad  exchange  worked. 
Figures 4 and 5 were also changed to fix the interval on the X axis 
to be in weeks. Most importantly, we were sure to reference and 
describe  each  figure  that  we  included  in  the  paper  so  that  there 
was  no  confusion  as 
their  meaning  or  purpose.
