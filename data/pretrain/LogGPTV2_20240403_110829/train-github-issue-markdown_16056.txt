I recently updated to the latest version of Atom (0.121.0) and encountered an issue where the application automatically opens in full-screen mode. Unfortunately, toggling the full-screen mode does not resolve the problem.

This issue may be related to the following reported problems: #3256 and #3257.

For reference, I have attached a screenshot illustrating the issue:
