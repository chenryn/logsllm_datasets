The code to complete the waypoint, according to the example text, is:
    $("#target2").appendTo("#right-well");
After going to the Gitter Help channel I was able to pass this waypoint using
    $("#target2").appendTo($("#right-well"));
In the course of an hour or so in the help channel, there were at least 5
other people experiencing the same issue.
