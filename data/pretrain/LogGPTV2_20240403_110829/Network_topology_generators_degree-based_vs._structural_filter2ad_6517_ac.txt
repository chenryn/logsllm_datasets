agree with our conclusions [35, 44].
each other quantitatively. Also, when policy routing is taken into
account, the resilience of the RL and AS graphs decreases (the for-
mer by almost a factor of two), although its qualitative behavior as
a function of ball size remains unchanged for both graphs. Of the
generated networks, Waxman closely resembles Random, and Tiers
closely resembles Mesh. TS has low R11, similar to Tree.12 Fi-
nally, PLRG has high resilience, like Random, although it does not
match Random as closely as Waxman does.
Following our low/high classiﬁcation of Section 3.2.1, we then
say that TS and Tree have low resilience, and all the other networks
have high resilience.
4.3 Distortion
Figures 2(c,f,i) plot D for our measured, generated and canon-
ical networks. The distortion of the Tree is low, whereas that for
Mesh and Random are high.
By our reckoning, the measured networks (Figure 2(h)) have low
distortion, more so when policy routing is taken into account. Their
distortion, although it increases with , appears qualitatively differ-
ent from Mesh or Random. The same is true of most of the gener-
ated networks, with the sole exception of Waxman.
From this discussion, we conclude that Random, Mesh and Wax-
man all have high distortion. All other networks have low distor-
tion.

Both measured graphs have rapid expansion, high resilience, and
relatively low distortion; that is, these networks can be seen as tree-
like, except that they are resilient. Policy routing does not change
this classiﬁcation. Even though there is no a priori reason to as-
sume that the AS and RL topologies would be qualitatively similar,
our metrics suggest that they are quite similar, at least in terms of
the properties measured by our metrics.13
11TS has many parameters, one of which is the fraction of redundant
transit-to-stub or stub-to-stub links. We tried varying this parameter
(from 1% to 60%) in an attempt to increase the resilience of TS.
When we do so, however, the distortion of TS increases to match
that of the random graph.
12Notice that there are minor irregularities in R for TS. We at-
tribute this to the observation that, of two balls of slightly differing
size, a larger ball can have a lower resilience. For example, con-
sider this contrived example of two completely connected networks
each with  nodes joined by a single link. A ball of radius 1 cen-
tered on any node has a resilience of ; a ball of radius 3 centered
on any node has a resilience of 1.
13The results presented here contain one instance of each of the AS
and RL graphs. In fact, we computed these metrics for at least two
other instances, generated more than six months apart from each
other (see footnote 3 for dates). Moreover, the RL graph of August
1999 was approximately a factor of two larger than the later graphs
(the size difference is due to the difference in the duration of exe-
