### 4.2 Resilience

Our conclusions are supported by references [35, 44]. The resilience of the RL and AS graphs decreases when policy routing is considered, with the former decreasing by almost a factor of two. However, the qualitative behavior as a function of ball size remains unchanged for both graphs. Among the generated networks, Waxman closely resembles Random, and Tiers closely resembles Mesh. TS has low resilience, similar to Tree. PLRG, on the other hand, exhibits high resilience, though not as closely aligned with Random as Waxman.

Based on our classification in Section 3.2.1, we categorize TS and Tree as having low resilience, while all other networks are classified as having high resilience.

### 4.3 Distortion

Figures 2(c, f, i) plot the distortion \(D\) for our measured, generated, and canonical networks. The Tree network shows low distortion, whereas Mesh and Random exhibit high distortion.

According to our analysis, the measured networks (Figure 2(h)) have low distortion, which becomes even more pronounced when policy routing is taken into account. Although the distortion increases with the ball size, it qualitatively differs from that of Mesh or Random. This trend is also observed in most of the generated networks, with Waxman being the sole exception.

From this, we conclude that Random, Mesh, and Waxman all have high distortion. All other networks, including the measured ones, have low distortion.

### 4.4 Discussion

The preceding discussion reveals the following low/high classifications for our measured and generated networks:

| Topology | Expansion | Resilience | Distortion | Comment |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------|
| Mesh     | H         | H          | H          | High expansion, high resilience, high distortion |
| Random   | H         | H          | H          | High expansion, high resilience, high distortion |
| Tree     | L         | L          | L          | Low expansion, low resilience, low distortion |
| Complete | H         | H          | L          | Like complete graph |
| Linear   | L         | L          | L          | No counterpart |
| AS, RL, PLRG | H | H | L | High expansion, high resilience, low distortion |
| Tiers    | H         | H          | L          | Like Random |
| TS       | H         | L          | L          | Low resilience, low distortion |
| Waxman  | H         | H          | H          | High expansion, high resilience, high distortion |

Both measured networks (AS and RL) exhibit rapid expansion, high resilience, and relatively low distortion. These networks can be seen as tree-like but with high resilience. Policy routing does not alter this classification. Despite no a priori reason to assume that AS and RL topologies would be qualitatively similar, our metrics suggest that they are quite similar in terms of the properties measured.

**Note:**
- TS has many parameters, one of which is the fraction of redundant transit-to-stub or stub-to-stub links. We varied this parameter (from 1% to 60%) in an attempt to increase the resilience of TS. However, increasing this parameter also increased the distortion to match that of the random graph.
- There are minor irregularities in the resilience \(R\) for TS. For example, consider two completely connected networks each with \(k\) nodes joined by a single link. A ball of radius 1 centered on any node has a resilience of \(k\), while a ball of radius 3 centered on any node has a resilience of 1.
- The results presented here include one instance each of the AS and RL graphs. We computed these metrics for at least two other instances, generated more than six months apart. The RL graph of August 1999 was approximately twice the size of the later graphs, due to differences in the duration of execution.
