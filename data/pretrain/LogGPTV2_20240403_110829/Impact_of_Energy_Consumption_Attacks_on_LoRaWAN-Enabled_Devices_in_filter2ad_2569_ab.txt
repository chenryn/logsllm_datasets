acknowledged transmission mode for reliable packet delivery, the 
on/off  DoS  attack  can  manipulate  the  end  device  to  attempt  to 
retransmit  the  packet  several  times  (up  to  8).  The  adversary  can 
execute this attack for short intervals  that can potentially pose a 
stealthy threat to the energy consumption of the end device due to 
the  retransmission  of  packets.  We  argue  that  this  attack  can 
significantly increase  the  energy  consumption  of  the  end  device. 
Nevertheless, the adversaries can execute the attack persistently to 
drain the energy of the batteries. Consequently, such attacks can 
incur high financial losses due to interruption of related operations 
such as outage notification and polling algorithm in OMS.

Execution. We  power  on  the  LoRaWAN  end  device  using  the 
external  power  source  of  3.3  Volts  as  per  the  vendor’s 
recommendations.  Following  initialization,  the  microcontroller

the  end  device  with 
acknowledged  transmission  mode  and  measure  the  energy 
consumption for the SF value of 7 and 12 under no energy attack. 
To  emulate  the  attack  scenario  for  the  next  two  sets  of 
experiments,  we  use  another  LoRaWAN  gateway  as  a  rogue 
device  to  execute  an  on/off  DoS  attack  by  configuring  the  same 
RX1  configuration  as  of  the  victim’s  device.  We  enable  the 
acknowledged  transmission  mode  and  execute  the  on/off  DoS 
attack for a few seconds for the SF value of 7 and 12. We execute 
the  attack  until  several  retransmissions  of  packets  are  done.  We 
use  the  experimental  results  to  evaluate  the  impact  of  an  on/off 
DoS attack on energy consumption utilizing different SF values.

approximately  18  times  more  energy  than  the  end  devices

between  the  energy  consumption  for  both  values  of  SF  is  also 
attributed  to  the  receive  windows  parameter.  Nevertheless,  RX2 
uses the highest SF for the downlink acknowledgment as opposed 
to RX1, which uses the uplink SF. In the case of SF 12, both RX1 
and  RX2  utilize  the  highest  SF  which  also  corresponds  to  the 
lowest data rates and more airtime.

The  second  set  of  two  experimental  results  show  the  impact  of 
on/off DoS attacks on the energy consumption of the end device. 
The on/off DoS attack was executed frequently for the duration of 
a few seconds to keep the end device in retransmitting mode until 
the  message  is  finally  transmitted.  For  SF  7,  the  demonstrated 
attack  increased  the  energy  consumption  of  a  single  successful 
transmission of the packet to 210 mJ, 5 times more than the result 
for the same SF under no attack. To this end, the LoRaWAN device 
utilizing SF 12 shows the significant energy consumption of 3830 
mJ  for  a  single  packet  successful  transmission  after  various 
retransmission  attempts.  The  results  clearly  show  that  the 
retransmission of packets due to the on/off attack has a significant 
impact on the device utilizing higher SF which can be attributed to 
the packets airtime, packets collision factor, and receive windows 
parameter. 
5  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In  this  study,  we  briefly  discussed  the  efficacy  of  LoRaWAN  for 
OMS  in  smart  metering.  Particularly,  we  discussed  the  energy 
consumption  attacks  that  how  an  adversary  can  manipulate  the 
parameters  of  LoRaWAN  to  significantly  diminish  the  battery 
lifetime  of  the  end  device.  Our  results  show  that  the  end  device 
using  acknowledged  transmission  for  fair  packet  delivery  can  be 
susceptible  to  on/off  DoS  attacks.  The  end  node  utilizing  SF  12 
under an on/off DoS attack can consume approximately 92 times 
more  energy  as  compared  to  the  end  node  using  SF  7  under  no 
attack  in  acknowledged  transmission  mode.  To  this  end,  the 
applications that require retransmission of packets for fair packet 
delivery  must  ensure  the  avoidance  of  using  high  spreading 
factors. In the future, we aim to further investigate the impact of 
energy  attacks  for  different  sizes  of  data  payload  in  accordance 
with the spreading factors. In this direction, we believe that robust 
analysis is needed to evaluate the vulnerability of LoRaWAN end 
devices against various types of energy attacks.
