### Acknowledged Transmission Mode and On/Off DoS Attacks

In the acknowledged transmission mode, which ensures reliable packet delivery, an on/off Denial of Service (DoS) attack can manipulate the end device to attempt retransmissions up to eight times. The adversary can execute this attack in short intervals, posing a stealthy threat to the energy consumption of the end device due to repeated packet retransmissions. We argue that this attack can significantly increase the energy consumption of the end device. If executed persistently, such attacks can drain the battery, leading to high financial losses due to interruptions in operations like outage notifications and polling algorithms in Outage Management Systems (OMS).

### Experimental Evaluation

#### Experimental Setup
We used a Libelium LoRaWAN microcontroller with an events sensor board and 12CXL-MaxSonar ultrasonic sensors for demonstrating a LoRaWAN application. For downlink transmissions, we employed a Multitech Conduit gateway, which is programmable and uses Node-Red for visual development. This gateway logs all packet transmission history. The LoRaWAN microcontroller was programmed to join the gateway using the Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) method. We configured the transmit power to 14 dBm, maximum payload to 51 bytes, and bandwidth to 125 kHz for all experiments. The distance between the gateway and the end device was set to 45 meters. An oscilloscope was used to measure power fluctuations during the experiment.

#### Execution
The LoRaWAN end device was powered on using an external 3.3-volt power source, as recommended by the vendor. After initialization, the microcontroller connected to the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART) 0. For the first two sets of experiments, we configured the end device with acknowledged transmission mode and measured energy consumption for Spreading Factor (SF) values of 7 and 12 under no energy attack. To emulate the attack scenario for the next two sets of experiments, we used another LoRaWAN gateway as a rogue device to execute an on/off DoS attack by configuring the same RX1 settings as the victim's device. We enabled the acknowledged transmission mode and executed the on/off DoS attack for a few seconds for SF values of 7 and 12, continuing until several retransmissions were performed. The experimental results were used to evaluate the impact of the on/off DoS attack on energy consumption at different SF values.

#### Results
The results from our experiments are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. The first two sets of results compare the impact of the spreading factor on energy consumption in acknowledged transmission mode. Under no energy attack, the end device configured with SF 12 consumed approximately 18 times more energy than the end device configured with SF 7 when transmitting 51 bytes of payload. The longer airtime required for higher SF values significantly increased energy consumption. Additionally, the significant difference in energy consumption for both SF values is also attributed to the receive windows parameter. In the case of SF 12, both RX1 and RX2 use the highest SF, corresponding to the lowest data rates and more airtime.

**Table 1: Energy Consumption Under No Attack**

| Spreading Factor | Sensitivity (dBm) | Payload (Bytes) | Energy (mJ) |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 7                | -123.0            | 51              | 41.4        |
| 12               | -137.0            | 51              | 760         |

**Table 2: Energy Consumption Under On/Off DoS Attack**

| Spreading Factor | Sensitivity (dBm) | Payload (Bytes) | Energy (mJ) |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 7                | -123.0            | 51              | 210         |
| 12               | -137.0            | 51              | 3830        |

The second set of two experimental results shows the impact of on/off DoS attacks on the energy consumption of the end device. The on/off DoS attack was executed frequently for a few seconds, keeping the end device in retransmitting mode until the message was finally transmitted. For SF 7, the demonstrated attack increased the energy consumption of a single successful transmission to 210 mJ, five times more than the result for the same SF under no attack. For SF 12, the energy consumption for a single packet successful transmission after multiple retransmission attempts was 3830 mJ. These results clearly show that packet retransmissions due to the on/off attack have a significant impact, especially for devices using higher SF values, due to factors such as packet airtime, packet collision, and receive windows parameters.

### Conclusion and Future Work

In this study, we discussed the efficacy of LoRaWAN for OMS in smart metering, focusing on energy consumption attacks. Our results show that end devices using acknowledged transmission for fair packet delivery are susceptible to on/off DoS attacks. Specifically, an end node using SF 12 under an on/off DoS attack can consume approximately 92 times more energy than an end node using SF 7 under no attack. Therefore, applications requiring packet retransmissions for reliable delivery should avoid using high spreading factors. In future work, we aim to investigate the impact of energy attacks for different data payload sizes and further analyze the vulnerability of LoRaWAN end devices against various types of energy attacks.
