Subject: Suggestion for Clarification in `scipy.stats.linregress` Documentation

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I have been unable to find a more direct method of contact, so I am submitting this as a bug report. I would like to suggest an improvement to the documentation for the `scipy.stats.linregress` function.

Specifically, the current description for the `stderr` parameter is:

```plaintext
stderr : float
    Standard error of the estimate
```

This description is somewhat ambiguous, as it does not specify which estimate the standard error refers to. For clarity, I propose changing it to:

```plaintext
stderr : float
    Standard error of the estimate of the slope
```

or a similarly clear and specific alternative.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,  
Stephan
