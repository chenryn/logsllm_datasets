Hi,
since I found NO way to contact anyone in a reasonable amount of time, I see
no other way than a bug report:
The description in scipy.stats.linregress
    stderr : float
    Standard error of the estimate
is absolutely inexpressive -- what estimate? I propose changing this to
    Standard error of the estimate of the slope
or something...
Cheers  
Stephan
