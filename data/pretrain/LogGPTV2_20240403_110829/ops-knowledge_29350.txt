User: I have a python script which I can run from pythonwin on which I give the arguments. 
Is it possible to automate this so that when I just click on the *.py file, I don't see the script and it asks for the path in a dos window?
Assistant: Rename it to *.pyw to hide the console on execution in Windows.
