I have a Python script that I currently run from PythonWin, where I provide the necessary arguments. Is it possible to automate this process so that when I simply click on the `.py` file, a DOS window appears and prompts me for the path, without showing the script itself?

**Solution:**
To achieve this, you can rename your script with a `.pyw` extension. This will hide the console window when the script is executed on Windows. However, to prompt for input in a DOS window, you may need to create a batch file (`.bat`) that runs your script and handles the input.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can set up the batch file:

1. Rename your script to `your_script.pyw`.
2. Create a batch file, e.g., `run_script.bat`, with the following content:

```batch
@echo off
set /p path="Please enter the path: "
pythonw your_script.pyw %path%
```

3. Double-click the `run_script.bat` file to execute your script and be prompted for the path in a DOS window.

This way, the script will run without displaying the console, and the batch file will handle the input and execution.
