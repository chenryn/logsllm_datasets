Subject: Issue with OpenCV and OpenVINO on Windows - Unable to Read Video Files

Hi,

I am currently experiencing an issue when attempting to use OpenCV, which was installed via OpenVINO, on a Windows system. The problem is that the application cannot read video files, regardless of their format (I have tested both MP4 and AVI).

Here is the error message I receive:

```
MFX: Unsupported extension
[ WARN:0] global opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (680) CvCapture_MSMF::initStream
Failed to set mediaType (stream 0, (352x288 @ 25)
MFVideoFormat_RGB32(unsupported media type)
```

Despite trying to resolve this by installing different codecs, the problem persists.

### Platform Information:
- **OpenVINO Version:** 4.3.0-14-g9a54a3273 (OpenVINO/2020.3)

Thank you in advance.
