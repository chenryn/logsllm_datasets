ability later in Sec. 4. Even though VoltageIDS and Scission does not
rely on multiple messages, it is not motivated by the vulnerability
of multi-frame-based IDS techniques. Besides, they exploit features
in both time and frequency domain, which leads to high complexity.
Our proposed voltage based PLI scheme, SIMPLE, chooses fea-
tures only from the time domain and avoids the complexity of fre-
quency domain transformations. It performs a single-frame based
detection that is not vulnerable to changes in ambient conditions.
Hence, we avoid the unnecessary feature retraining every time the
vehicle gets restarted. Both are accomplished by using a higher
resolution and higher sampling rate sampler; i.e., a cost-vs-security
tradeoff is made to detect an attack using a single frame. Specif-
ically, while Viden [9] only needs to acquire a few samples per
frame over multiple frames, and thus needs only a low-rate sampler,
SIMPLE needs multiple samples for a single frame and thus requires
a high-rate sampler. Nevertheless, SIMPLE is still practical since a
sufficiently high resolution and high sample-rate sampler can be
acquired for less than $10 per CAN bus [45]. Additionally, unlike
Viden, we do not require a separate intrusion detection system (IDS)
next to our identification system. Unlike CIDS [8], we can handle
both periodic and aperiodic messages. Finally, our approach incurs
lower overhead and cost than VoltageIDS [10], as we require fewer
samples and a lower sampling rate.
1Scission used a slightly different setup for the prototype in which each ECU has a dif-
ferent stub length (2.45 - 13 meters) necessitating stub terminations. This imperfection
in CAN bus topology can effect the voltage profile of the ECUs and bias the results
knowing that the strongest features in Scission are extracted from the overshoot at the
rising edge. In the setup used by SIMPLE however, the length of stubs are all identical
and short enough (less than 5 cm) to be negligible.

All the voltage-based identifiers given in Table 1 illustrate a non-
zero value for the error rates. As small as these values are, not even
a frame can go wrong for safety critical applications such as air
bags. Further efforts like augmented solutions need to be taken to
provide the required security for such applications. SIMPLE has the
lowest time complexity (Table 1), while Viden takes Ω(n2) time for
each update due to the use of the Recursive Least Squares algorithm.
VoltageIDS and Scission need Ω(n log n) time because they perform
Fourier Transforms in every update to obtain frequency domain
features.
3 ATTACK MODEL
We consider an adversary capable of compromising one or more2
ECUs either remotely via wireless interfaces (e.g., the telematic
port [19, 33]) or physically (e.g., via OBD-II [30]). Once compro-
mised, the ECU is under full control of the adversary and becomes
an attacker ECU. With the full control, the adversary can either
suspend the ECU or even re-program it to inject arbitrary messages,
e.g., use arbitrary message IDs to impersonate another ECU and/or
transmit messages containing forged/spurious data 3. These mes-
sages are called attack messages. For example, the attacker could
compromise an ECU belonging to the entertainment system, and
send out “accelerate” or “shut down engine” commands under a
different message ID (which is normally sent by the engine con-
trol ECU), so as to spoof the engine to carry out wrong actions.
We assume that the adversary is aware of the IDS that is installed
on the CAN bus and the adversary is able to implement the same
algorithms as the IDS. The adversary can also obtain necessary
information that can be measured on the CAN bus (e.g., timing
and voltage information of other ECUs) using the compromised
ECU. Note that this is also assumed by CIDS [8] and Viden [9]. We
additionally assume that the ECUs are equipped with temperature
sensors with secure measurements.
Furthermore, there are two types of objectives that the adver-
sary may wish to achieve for an impersonation attack. First, it
2Our Hill-Climbing style attack requires compromising only one ECU to work. While
SIMPLE can defend against multiple compromised ECUs.
3Similar attack goals have been considered in previous works [8, 9]
may choose to pursue dominant impersonation where at the end
a majority of the messages with the targeted message ID are at-
tack messages; or it can choose to pursue complete impersonation
which is even stronger as the adversary is now able to replace all
legitimate messages with attack messages. The methods to achieve
these attacks will be detailed in the next section. We assume that
the attacker can either directly inject its own frame onto the CAN
(when no other ECUs are transmitting) or preventing another ECU
from transmitting. The latter can be done by synchronizing to the
regular messages on the CAN bus and play attack messages right
before the one that a legitimate ECU is about to send [34], or by
contending with the latter during the arbitration phase [4, 7].
Note that, the attacker ECU could also inject false data under its
own ID, however this is not as effective as impersonation, because
CAN messages are addressed by its message IDs which typically
represent the data type (e.g., an engine ECU would ignore a message
with one of the IDs belonging to an entertainment ECU). Hence,
false data injection attack detection is out of scope of this work.
Detection of denial-of-service attacks, such as the bus-off attack [7]
will also be studied in the future.
4 VULNERABILITY OF MULTI-FRAME BASED
FINGERPRINTING SYSTEMS
In a multi-frame based fingerprinting system, a batch of multiple
frames has to be collected in order to perform one update of the
fingerprinting record/threshold. Such fingerprinting schemes are
vulnerable to the so-called Hill-climbing-style attack, where the
adversary is able to control the quantity of attack frames among the
batch of frames collected, so that the attacker ECU can both hide its
identity and shift the fingerprinting decision threshold gradually.
Specifically, from the batch of n collected frames, only m of those
are attack frames. The injection ratio r = m/n can be carefully
chosen for each step, so that the IDS cannot identify the attacker.
More importantly, the fingerprinting decision threshold will be
shifted via raising r iteratively, so that eventually, the attacker will
be able to impersonate the legitimate ECU.
In this section, we will use the Viden fingerprinting system [9]
as our case study to demonstrate how multi-frame based schemes

are vulnerable to the Hill-climbing-style attack. In the system, two
fingerprinting schemes are employed independently in parallel: (i)
Clock-based IDS (CIDS) [8] that tries to estimate the clock skews of
different ECUs; and (ii) Voltage-based Identification (Viden) [9] that
tries to abstract the voltage output characteristics. Both schemes
collect a batch of frames, calculate the momentary features that
ideally are constant over time, and then accumulate the latest fea-
ture with all historical ones. Because of the constancy of features,
the cumulated quantity appears linear over time; hence the slope
of it can be regarded as the profile of an ECU (i.e., the clock-skew S
and the voltage profile ϒ). Details of the two works are re-stated in
Appendix A. Here, we mainly focus on the fingerprinting system
and we leave the discussion about the intrusion detection system
to the end of this section.
As discussed in Sec. 3, the adversary can pursue the dominant
impersonation or the complete impersonation. It will be demon-
strated in the rest of this section that the former is easier to succeed,
whereas the latter is stronger. This is summarized in an attack tree
(Fig. 2a).
4.1 Dominant Impersonation
An example of the dominant impersonation is given in Fig. 2b,
where the attack frames are injected right after the legitimate frames
so that the attack frames will be in charge of the vehicle for most of
the time [12]. With the carefully chosen injection ratio r for each
step, the adversary will be able to evade identification 4. Note that
CIDS does not work because the periodicity of frames is disrupted,
thus the adversary only has to defeat the voltage-based scheme [9]
at this point.
Let us suppose the adversary compromises ECU A and runs the
voltage-based fingerprinting scheme on it for k0 steps. The adver-
sary decides to start the intrusion at step k0 +1 to impersonate ECU
B. In each of these future steps, the voltage-based fingerprinting
scheme will observe a batch of n mixed frames, consisting of m at-
tack frames sent from ECU A and n−m legitimate frames sent from
ECU B, both with B’s target ID. The adversary wants to enlarge
m as much as possible, while it does not want the fingerprinting

trivially detected based on the periodicity of CAN frames. But complete impersonation
can evade both detection and identification.
scheme to identify A. To do so, the injection ratio r has to be chosen
carefully.
Given the learnt voltage profiles ϒA[k − 1] and ϒB[k − 1] from
the previous k − 1 steps, the adversary derives the desired voltage
profile, ϒB[k], of the mixed frames for the next step (i.e., k-th step)
by solving the following optimization problem:
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ϒB[k] − 1

Appendix A.2. Finally we have the maximum injection ratio

ϒA[k − 1] − ϒB[k0] .

(4)
With the maximum injection ratio, the adversary will be able to
inject as many attack frames as possible at step k while avoiding
identification. Since the legitimate ECU B is identified as the source,
Viden accepts this batch of frames and updates ϒB to be a bit closer
to ϒA. With the updated profile, the adversary will be able to get an
even higher r, thus injecting more and more attack frames at each
future step. Hence, the injection ratio r will be able to reach 1/2.
Note that the attack will not trigger the random forest classifier of
Viden because the attack will not bring two profiles close to each
other; instead, it is only the profile of the legitimate ECU that gets
shifted (not the profile of the attacker ECU).
The adversary can of course continue shifting the profile, i.e., r
is approaching one. In the dominant impersonation, it is unneces-
sary to do so because it will not increase the amount of time that
the attack frames take effect on the vehicle (Fig. 2b). However, it
becomes necessary in the complete impersonation.
4.2 Complete Impersonation
Although the dominant impersonation is strong enough to let the
vehicle follow what the attack frames instruct, there are still some

the vehicle to behave as normal. This conflict may cause suspicion.
As a result, the adversary wants to block B from sending any
frame, i.e., r = 1, by contending with the legitimate ECU B during
the arbitration phase, using a forged and smaller identifier (than
B’s), making B lose the contention.

mate frame, the adversary has to know beforehand when the legiti-
mate frame will be sent. To do so, the attacker ECU A learns the
