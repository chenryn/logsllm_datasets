## Expected Behavior
When calling Dialog component with fullWidth=true and no other props I would
expect the Dialog to take up the full width of the screen
## Current Behavior
What's happening is because the of the defaultProps value for maxWidth is 'sm'
the true width ends up being capped at 600px like so:

I only noticed the issue when I accidentally put 'lg' a value which is not
supported and noticed that it worked like I wanted it to
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Open Dialog component with props fullScreen=true
## Context
I would like to submit a PR if approved to check if there is fullScreen
applied and no maxWidth prop provided to ignore the defaultProps of 'sm'
