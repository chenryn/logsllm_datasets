User: How to solve the database lock problem?
Assistant: Database deadlock refers to some resources in the database being locked due to some reasons, but other transactions cannot use the resources, which leads to long waiting time of transactions and affects system performance and stability. To solve the database lock problem, you can take the following measures: 1. Optimize the SQL query statement to reduce the lock occupation time and conflict probability. 2. Use more efficient database lock strategies to avoid deadlocks, such as read-write locks, pessimistic locks, optimistic locks, etc. 3. Reasonably set the isolation level of the transaction to reduce the probability of deadlock. 4. Limit concurrent connections at the application layer to avoid too many connections sending requests at the same time, resulting in tight resources. 5. Establish appropriate indexes in the database to improve query efficiency and reduce resource contention. 6. Regularly clean up useless transactions and useless lock resources to prevent excessive occupation of lock resources. 7. Using distributed lock technology, the processing power of the lock is distributed from a single server to multiple servers, thereby improving the performance and stability of the system. 8. Maintain the health status of the database, regularly monitor the running status of the database, find problems in time and deal with them.
