User: How to use Python for network data scraping and processing?
Assistant: The following are the steps to use Python to capture and process network data: 1. Confirm requirements and target websites: First, you need to confirm your needs and target websites, and specify the type and amount of data to be captured. 2. Install related libraries: Python has many libraries for network data capture, such as requests, beautifulsoup, selenium, etc. You need to install related libraries first. 3. Use the requests library to request data: the requests library is one of the most commonly used libraries in Python, which can be used to send requests to the target website and obtain data on the website. 4. Use the beautifulsoup library to parse the data: the beautifulsoup library is a commonly used HTML parsing library in Python, which can be used to parse the HTML code on the website and extract the required data. 5. Use the selenium library to simulate browser operations: When the website uses dynamic technologies such as JavaScript to render pages, requests and beautifulsoup may not be able to obtain the complete page content. At this time, you can use the selenium library to simulate browser operations to obtain the complete page. 6. Data processing: The captured data may need to be processed and cleaned, such as removing html tags, extracting keywords, etc. 7. Store data: Finally, store the processed data in a local file or database. Sample code: Use requests to get the data of TOP250 Douban movies: ``` import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = "https://movie.douban.com/top250" response = requests.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(response. text, 'html.parser') movies = soup.find_all('div',class_='hd') for movie in movies: print(movie.span.string) ``` Use selenium to obtain websites that need to simulate browser operations Data: ``` from selenium import webdriver from bs4 import BeautifulSoup url = "https://www.baidu.com" driver = webdriver.Chrome() driver.get(url) soup = BeautifulSoup(driver.page_source, 'html. parser') print(soup.find('input', {'id': 'kw'}).attrs['value']) driver.quit() ```
