Hi everyone,
I need to have some help with an annoying thing.  
I have an modal popup which has vertical scrollsbar inside. When scrolling
inside the modal sometimes the background scrolls instead.  
I have tried to add
body .modal-open {  
position:relative;  
overflow: hidden;  
}
which works fine on most of the browsers, but Safari for my iPhone still
scrolls!
Please help me find how to solve this!
Regards Kristian
