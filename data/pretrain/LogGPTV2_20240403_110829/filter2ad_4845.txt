ABSTRACT 
Nowadays Passive Optical Network (PON) requires that Optical 
Network  Units  (ONUs)  wake  up  periodically  to  check  if  the 
Optical Line Terminal (OLT) has any message directed to them. 
This implies that ONUs change from sleeping mode in which they 
just consume 1 W to active mode in which the consumption goes 
up to 10 W. In many cases, the OLT does not have any packets 
for the ONU and it goes to sleep again, what supposes a waste of 
energy. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid ONU that relies 
on  a  low-cost  and  low-energy  technology,  IEEE  802.15.4,  to 
wake up those ONUs that are going to receive a packet. Our first 
estimations  demonstrates  that  our  solution  would  save  around 
25000$ per year and OLT.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
In  a  Passive  Optical  Network  (PON),  an  Optical  Line  Terminal 
(OLT) is the centralized intelligence. It receives the packets from 
the core network and then delivers them to the destination Optical 
Network  Unit  (ONU)  through  optical  fiber.    On  the  other  hand, 
the  OLT  assigns  fixed  time  slots  to  the  ONUs  for  the  upstream 
transmission.  In  a  typical  PON  architecture,  in  the  downstream 
direction  signal  is  broadcasted  using  a  passive  splitter,  while  in 
the  uplink  an  ONU  uses  unicast  transmissions.  Under  one  OLT 
there can be 16, 32, or 64 ONUs.  
According to the existing solutions [1, 2], an ONU goes to sleep 
mode when it does not have anything to send or receive. Then, the 
OLT  sends  a  message  to  the  ONU  informing  the  next  listening 
interval. ONU needs to wake up before that listening interval in 
order  to  receive  the  OLT’s  feedback.  If  there  is  any  packet 
destined  for  that  ONU,  the  OLT  forwards  it  to  the  ONU. 
Otherwise,  the  OLT  notifies  the  ONU  when  the  next  listening 
interval  will  take  place  and  asks  to  switch  into  sleep  state. 
Conversely,  if  an  ONU  receives  any  packets  from  the  customer 
premises to the network, it stores the packet and transmits to the 
OLT during the assigned uplink transmission slot.

When the packet arrival rate is low, an ONU can take long sleep 
[1, 2] to save more energy. In such case, any arrived packet at the 
OLT  might  experience  delay.  As  shown  in  Figure  1  the  first 
packet  destined  to  ONU  1  experiences  delay  D  =  t1-t0. 
Furthermore,  in  the  existing  approaches  an  ONU needs to wake 
up  periodically  and  listen,  even  though  it  may  not  have  any 
downstream  packets  to  receive  (see  Figure  1).  During  these 
listening  intervals  an  ONU  approximately  consumes  10  W  of 
power, whereas the sleeping mode just requires 1 W consumption. 
Indeed, it is a waste of energy.  
In this paper, we address those aforementioned issues. To mitigate 
such  problems,  we  introduce  a  new  ONU  module,  named  as 
Hybrid  OUN  (HONU),  and  a  novel  protocol  procedures.  Using 
our approach, a significant amount of energy can be saved.

2.  SOLUTION 
The  new  ONU  architecture  (i.e.,  HONU)  integrates  the  existing 
ONU  module  and  an  IEEE  802.15.4  module.  In  this  approach, 
when  the  ONU  module  needs  to  go  to  sleep  state  the  IEEE 
802.15.4 module takes over the responsibility of periodic listening 
through  its  wireless  interface,  and  after  a  packet  arrival  at  the 
OLT,  it  is  invoked  to  make  the  ONU  module  waking  up.  We 
design the protocol procedure in such a way that IEEE 802.15.4 
module  of  a  sleeping  HONU  can  be  invoked  from  the  OLT 
through  other  active  HONUs’  IEEE  802.15.4  module  using  its 
wireless interface. It must be noted that IEEE 802.15.4 is a low-
cost technology whose installation will just be a minor part of the 
budget  required  to  deploy  a  PON  network.  Therefore,  at  a  very 
low cost, we will be able to reduce a lot the energy consumption 
by extending the time in which an ONU uses the sleeping mode. 
Basically, an ONU is composed of two parts: analog and digital 
as shown in Figure 2 (a). In absence of packet arrival, ONU goes 
to  sleep  mode  by  switching  off  most  of  the  components  (e.g., 
laser driver circuit, Tx, Rx [2]) of its Analog part. After switching 
off  those  components,  the  sleep  coordinator  notifies  Interrupter 
428(i.e.,  IEEE  802.15.4)  module  to  wake  up  periodically  to  check 
whether  there  is  any  downstream  packet  arrival  notification 
arrives or not.

deployment scenario in a customer premises. 
We assume that at a given time at least one of the HOUNs is in 
active mode under the OLT. The OLT needs to notify a HONU on 
downstream  packet  arrival.  Hence,  even  if  there  is  no  incoming 
downstream  traffic,  OLT  invokes  one  of  the  HONUs  to  stay  in 
active mode. As a result, the OLT can reach any Interrupter and 
make  a  HONU’s  analog  part  active  on  packet  arrival.  
Furthermore,  we  assume  that  in  the  customer  premises  all  the 
Interrupters  can  communicate  among  themselves  through  their 
wireless  interfaces.  Figure  2  (b)  states  a  scenario  where  OLT 
requests  the  HONU  1  to  be  waked  up  through  the  HONU  n, 
which is in active mode.  
As  the  number  of  PON  hosts  is  exponentially  increasing,  there 
would  not  be  much  distance  between  two  HOUNs  (e.g.,  the 
distance can be two consecutive buildings in an urban area). Then 
PON  operators  should  deploy  an  IEEE  802.15.4  network  that 
allows  the  interconnection  of  the  different  HONUs  satisfying 
reliability  and  delay  requirements.  We  consider  that  all  these 
Interrupters and the intermediate relaying nodes sleep and wakeup 
synchronously. When a new packet arrives for a sleeping HONU, 
the OLT notifies the Interrupter of that HONU through any active 
HONU.  After  getting  the  notification  from  the  OLT,  the 
Interrupter  of  that  HONU  invokes  the  sleep  coordinator.  Sleep 
coordinator makes the analog part of the sleeping HONU active. 
Figure  3  states  how  HONU’s  ONU  module  switches  to  Active 
state. After being active, that ONU module synchronizes with the 
OLT’s downstream clock and then start receiving the packets.  
3.  INITIAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
We perform some initial analysis in order to compute the energy 
saved when a PON network utilizes the proposed HONUs instead 
of the standard one. Figure 3 depicts that while an ONU of a 10 G 
Ethernet  PON  consumes  10  W,  the  Interrupters  of  our  HONUs 
just need to use 30 mw [3] in the listening state. Then we roughly 
estimate that in a PON network with 32 ONUs our solution saves 
450 kW/day. Then, assuming an average kW price of 0.15$, our 
solution would save 67.5$ per day. If we extend that saving to a 
complete year, the saving per OLT and year goes up to $25000. 
Then,  in  case  an  operator  decides  to  widely  deploy  PON 
technology in a big and dense city (e.g. Seoul) thousands of OLTs 
would be required, and our solution would reduce electricity bill 
in  millions  of  dollars.  Besides,  as  all  the  HOUNs  are  reachable 
from the OLT, downstream packets experience reduced amount of 
delay. Future work will present this idea in more detailed.
