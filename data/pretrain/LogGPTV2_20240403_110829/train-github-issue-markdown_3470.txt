  * VSCode Version: 0.10.11
  * OS Version: Win 7
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Write some code with an 'if' statement, and a variable compared with an smaller-as '<' operator (without separating space).
  2. Add a code block bracket on the same line.
  3. Write more code in the block
Minimal example:  
`var j;`  
`if(j<2){`  
`var i=123;`  
`}`
Result in the dark+ standard scheme:

btw. what should the color of the `j`be? It is different in the second
example.
