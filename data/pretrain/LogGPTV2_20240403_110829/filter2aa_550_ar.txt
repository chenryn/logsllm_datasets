435 “Espionage Report...” 2007; Cody, 2007: Many vignettes could be recited here. In 2007, German Chan-
cellor Angela Merkel visited China for a state meeting which was overshadowed by a media claim that 
Chinese hackers had been caught attempting to steal data from Merkel’s chancellery and other Berlin 
ministries. The Chinese government denied the allegations, but Prime Minister Wen Jiabao nonethe-
less told Merkel that measures would be taken to “rule out hacking attacks.” The following month, 
Chinese Vice Information Industry Minister Lou Qinjian wrote in a Communist Party magazine that 
foreign intelligence services had also caused “massive and shocking” damage to China via computer 
hacking.

Arms Control: Can We Limit Cyber Weapons?
The first three principles – political will, universality, and assistance – are easy to 
apply in the cyber domain. None of them is a perfect fit, but as with CWC, all of them 
are appropriate to the nature and challenges of managing Internet security.
The final two principles – prohibition and inspection – are not helpful at this time. It 
is difficult to prohibit or inspect something that is hard to define and which grows 
by orders of magnitude on a regular basis. In fact, these two catches could prove sig-
nificant enough that a future treaty may not be called Cyber Weapons Convention, 
but something more generic, such as Internet Security Convention.
On balance, the three applicable principles provide world leaders with a good start-
ing point to explore the prospects for a Cyber Weapons Convention. If national and 
Internet security thinkers decide that an international cyber arms control treaty is 
the right way forward, political leaders may give scientists the funding they need to 
attack the technical challenges of prohibition and inspection.

9. DEMATEL AND STRATEGIC ANALYSIS
In this research study, the author will employ the Decision Making Trial and Evalua-
tion Laboratory (DEMATEL) to analyze the most important concepts and definitions. 
The goal of using DEMATEL is twofold: to increase the rigor of the author’s analysis 
via scientific method, and to help provide decision makers with greater confidence 
as they attempt to choose the most efficient ways to mitigate the threat of cyber at-
tacks and improve cyber security at the strategic level.
DEMATEL is a comprehensive scientific research method, developed in the 1970s 
by the Science and Human Affairs Program at the Battelle Memorial Institute in 
Geneva. It is used to solve scientific, political and economic problems that contain 
a complex array of important factors,436 which may involve many stakeholders.437 It 
has often been used, especially by researchers in Middle East and Far East, to inves-
tigate problems of strategic scope and significance.438
First, a DEMATEL researcher must identify and classify the key concepts or the most 
influential factors in a given system or in a particular area of research.
Second, all factors are placed into a pair-wise, “direct-influence” comparison matrix 
and prioritized by their level of influence on the other factors in the system: zero, or 
“no influence,” to four, or “very high influence.” The matrix isolates all of the factors 
within the system, as well as their one-to-one relationships.439 It displays the level of 
influence that each factor exerts on every other factor in the system, and provides a 
clear ranking of alternatives by influence level.440
Third, the influencing factors are depicted in a causal loop diagram that graphically 
displays how each factor exerts pressure on, and receives pressure from, all other 
factors in the system, including the strength of each influence relationship.

DEMATEL and Strategic Analysis
Fourth, DEMATEL calculates the combined effect of both the direct and indirect 
influence relationships, yielding a new overall influence score for all factors in the 
system. It is then possible to place all factors into a hierarchical structure.
In this way, DEMATEL helps to provide decision makers with the most efficient paths 
to a desired outcome. These contribute to workable solutions at the tactical level441 
and superior policy choices at the strategic level.442
DEMATEL Influencing Factors
Parts II and III of this book described cyber security as an emerging strategic con-
cept and examined four mitigation strategies that governments will likely adopt to 
counter the cyber attack threat. Fig. 1, below, summarizes these concepts as DEMA-
TEL “influencing factors.” Each is defined in more detail in this chapter.

National Security Threats
A cyber attack is best understood not as an end in itself, but as an extraordinary 
means to a wide variety of ends. At the tactical level, there are many objectives that 
an attacker seeks. Here are five of the most important.

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH RESULTS
Espionage. Every day, anonymous computer hackers steal vast quantities of com-
puter data and network communications. In fact, it is possible to conduct devastat-
ing intelligence-gathering operations, even on highly sensitive political and military 
communications, remotely from anywhere in the world.
Propaganda. Cheap and effective, this is often the easiest and the most powerful 
form of cyber attack. Propaganda dissemination may not need to incorporate any 
computer hacking at all, but simply take advantage of the amplification power of the 
Internet. Digital information, in text or image format and regardless of whether it 
is true – can be instantly copied and sent anywhere in the world, even deep behind 
enemy lines. And provocative information that is censored from the Web can reap-
pear elsewhere in seconds.
Denial-of-Service (DoS). The simple strategy behind a DoS attack is to deny the 
use of data or a computer resource to legitimate users. The most common tactic 
is to flood the target with so much superfluous data that it cannot respond to real 
requests for services or information. Today, black market botnets provide anyone 
with massive Distributed DoS (DDoS) resources and a high level of anonymity. Other 
DoS attacks include the physical destruction of computer hardware and the use of 
electromagnetic interference, designed to destroy unshielded electronics via current 
or voltage surges.
Data modification. A successful attack on the integrity of sensitive data is insidious 
because legitimate users (human or machine) may make subsequent critical deci-
sions based on maliciously altered information. Such attacks range from website de-
facement, which is often referred to as “electronic graffiti,” but which can still carry 
propaganda or disinformation, to the corruption of advanced weapons or command-
and-control (C2) systems.
Infrastructure manipulation. National critical infrastructures are, like everything 
else, increasingly connected to the Internet. However, because instant response may 
be required, and associated hardware could have insufficient computing resources, 
security may not be robust. Furthermore, the infrastructure could require instant or 
automatic response, so it may be unrealistic to expect that a human would be avail-
able to concur with every command the infrastructure is given.443
Complicating matters is the fact that most critical infrastructures are in private 
hands. Internet Service Providers (ISP), for example, typically lease communication 
lines to government as well as to commercial entities, and it is not uncommon for

satellite management corporations to offer bandwidth to multiple countries at the 
same time.444
The management of electricity is essential for national security planners to evaluate 
because electricity has no substitute, and all other infrastructures, including com-
puter networks, depend on it.445 Finally, it is important to note that many critical in-
frastructures are in private hands, outside of government protection and oversight.
Key Cyber Attack Advantages
As a medium through which a nation-state or a non-state actor can threaten the 
security or national security of a rival or adversary, cyberspace offers attackers 
numerous key advantages that facilitate and amplify the three traditional attack 
categories of confidentiality, integrity and availability. These are illustrated in Fig. 
2, below.
Figure 2. 
Key Cyber Attack Advantages.
Vulnerability. The Internet has an ingenious modular design that is remarkably 
resilient in the face of many classes of cyber attack. However, hackers regularly 
find sufficient flaws in its architecture to secretly read, delete, or modify informa-
tion stored on or traveling between computers. Further, the rapid proliferation in

DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH RESULTS
communications technologies provides sensitive sites with a level of redundancy 
unimagined in the past. However, on the downside it is a challenge for defenders to 
keep up with the latest attack methods. In fact, there are about 100 additions to the 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database each month.446 Constantly 
evolving malicious code often gives hackers more paths into a network than its sys-
tem administrators can protect.
Asymmetry. Nations, organizations, and individual hackers find in computer hack-
ing a very high return on investment. An attacker’s common goals are self-explana-
tory:  the theft of research and development data, eavesdropping on sensitive com-
munications, and the delivery of propaganda behind enemy lines. The elegance of 
computer hacking lies in the fact that it may be attempted for a fraction of the cost 
– and risk – of many other information collection or manipulation strategies.
Anonymity. The maze-like architecture of the Internet offers cyber attackers a high 
degree of anonymity. Smart hackers route their attacks through countries with 
which the victim’s government has poor diplomatic relations or no law enforcement 
cooperation. Even successful cyber investigations often lead only to another hacked 
computer. Governments today face the prospect of losing a cyber conflict without 
even knowing the identity of their adversary.
Inadequacy of cyber defense. Computer network security is still an immature disci-
pline. Traditional security skills are of marginal help in cyber warfare and it is diffi-
cult to retain personnel with marketable technical expertise. Challenging computer 
investigations are further complicated by the international nature of the Internet. 
Moreover, in the case of state-sponsored cyber operations, law enforcement coop-
eration is naturally non-existent.
The rise of non-state actors. The Internet era offers to everyone vastly increased 
participation on the world stage. Historically, governments have endeavored to re-
tain as much control as they can over international conflict. However, globalization 
and the Internet have considerably strengthened the ability of anyone to follow cur-
rent events and have provided a powerful means to influence them. Domestic and 
transnational subcultures now spontaneously coalesce online, sway myriad political 
agendas, and may not report to any traditional chain-of-command. A future chal-
lenge for world leaders is whether their own citizens could spin delicate interna-
tional diplomacy out of control.

DEMATEL and Strategic Analysis
Cyber Attack Categories
There are three basic forms of cyber attack, from which all others derive.
Confidentiality. This encompasses any unauthorized acquisition of information, 
including surreptitious “traffic analysis,” in which an attacker infers communica-
tion content merely by observing communication patterns. Because global network 
connectivity is currently well ahead of global network security, it can be easy for 
hackers to steal enormous amounts of information.
 Cyber terrorism and cyber warfare may still lie in our future, but we are already liv-
ing in a Golden Age of cyber espionage. The most famous case to date is “GhostNet,” 
investigated by Information Warfare Monitor, in which a cyber espionage network 
of over 1,000 compromised computers in 103 countries targeted diplomatic, politi-
cal, economic, and military information.447
Integrity. This is the unauthorized modification of information or information re-
sources such as a database. Integrity attacks can involve the “sabotage” of data for 
criminal, political, or military purposes.
Cyber criminals have encrypted data on a victim’s hard drive and then demanded 
a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Governments that censor 
Google results return part, but not all of the search engine’s suggestions to an end 
user.
Availability. The goal here is to prevent authorized users from gaining access to the 
systems or data they require to perform certain tasks. This is commonly referred 
to as a denial-of-service (DoS) and encompasses a wide range of malware, network 
traffic, or physical attacks on computers, databases and the networks that connect 
them.
In 2001, “MafiaBoy,” a 15 year-old student from Montreal, conducted a successful 
DoS attack against some of the world’s biggest online companies, likely causing over 
$1 billion in financial damage.448 In 2007, Syrian air defense was reportedly dis-
abled by a cyber attack moments before the Israeli air force demolished an alleged 
Syrian nuclear reactor.

Strategic Cyber Attack Targets
Cyber attacks of strategic significance do not occur every day. In fact, it is likely that 
the most powerful cyber weapons may be saved by militaries and intelligence agen-
cies for times of international conflict and war.
Some war tactics will change in order to account for the unique nature of cyber-
space and for the latent power of cyber warfare, but the ultimate goal of war – vic-
tory – will not change. As in past wars and as with other types of aggression, there 
are two broad categories of strategic targets that cyber attackers will strike.
Military forces. The first category of cyber attacks would be conducted as part of 
a broader effort to disable the adversary’s weaponry and to disrupt military com-
mand-and-control (C2) systems.
In 1997, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) held a large-scale cyber attack red 
team exercise called Eligible Receiver. The simulation was a success. As James Ad-
ams wrote in Foreign Affairs, thirty-five National Security Agency (NSA) personnel, 
posing as North Korean hackers, used a variety of cyber-enabled information war-
fare tactics to “infect the human command-and-control system with a paralyzing 
level of mistrust ... as a result, nobody in the chain of command, from the president 
on down, could believe anything.”449
In 2008, unknown hackers broke into a wide range of DoD computers, including a 
“highly protected classified network” of Central Command (CENTCOM), the organi-
zation which manages both wars in which the U.S. is now engaged. The Pentagon 
was so alarmed by the attack that Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Michael Mullen 
personally briefed President Bush on the incident.450
In the event of a future war between major world powers, it is wise to assume that 
the above-mentioned attacks would pale in comparison to the sophistication and 
scale of cyber tools and tactics that governments may hold in reserve for a time of 
national security crisis.
Government/civilian infrastructure. The second category of cyber attacks would 
target the adversary’s ability and willingness to wage war for an extended period of 
time. The targets would likely include an adversary’s financial sector, industry, and 
national morale.
One of the most effective ways to undermine a variety of these second-tier targets 
is to disrupt the generation and supply of power. President Obama’s announcement

that unknown hackers had “probed our electrical grid” and “plunged entire cities 
into darkness”451 in Brazil452 should serve as a wake-up call for many. Referring to 
theoretical cyber attacks on the financial sector, former U.S. Director of National 
Intelligence (DNI) Mike McConnell stated that his primary concern was not the theft 
of money, but a cyber attack that would target the integrity of the financial system 
itself, designed to destroy public confidence in the security and supply of money.453
In a future war between major world powers, militaries would likely exploit the ubiq-
uity of cyberspace and global connectivity to conduct a wide range of cyber attacks 
against adversary national critical infrastructures, on their home soil, deep behind 
the front lines of battle.
Cyber Attack Mitigation Strategies
This research has shown that cyber attackers possess significant advantages over 
cyber defenders, and that governments must now take the threat of strategic-level 
cyber attacks seriously. The four mitigation strategies examined in Part III are sum-
marized below.
Fig. 3 is a causal loop diagram that shows how cyber attack mitigation strategies are 
designed to reduce the impact of cyber attack advantages, with the ultimate goal of 
reducing threats to national security via cyberspace.

IPv6: The complex and evolving nature of IT tends to favor an attacker, who often 
finds a surfeit of network vulnerabilities to exploit. At the same time, the benefits of 
connectivity continue to ensure that returning to pen and paper is not an option. If 
there is a leading current technical solution to the cyber attack problem, a reason-
