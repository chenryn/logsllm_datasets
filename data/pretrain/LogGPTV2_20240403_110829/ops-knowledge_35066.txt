User: How to test the security of a web application, such as SQL injection, XSS attack, etc.?
Assistant: 1. Code audit: Static code analysis or manual review of applications to find common vulnerabilities, such as unvalidated user input, dynamically generated SQL statements, dynamically generated HTML code, etc. 2. Vulnerability Scanner: Use automated scanning tools, such as Netsparker, Acunetix, OpenVAS, etc., to detect common vulnerabilities in applications. 3. Manual testing: Manually simulate attack scenarios, such as various SQL injection attacks, XSS attacks, and file upload vulnerabilities. 4. Penetration testing: By simulating a hacker attack, test the security of the system and try to obtain sensitive information. 5. External penetration testing: Treat the test as an attack from a malicious attacker to test the real security of the system. 6. Internal penetration testing: Test the effectiveness of security strategies and technical defenses by simulating internal attacks. 7. Security drill: Simulate actual security incidents and attacks to test the response and response speed of the response team. 8. Mobile terminal security testing: conduct security testing on mobile applications and mobile websites, including sniffing mobile data packets, simulating malicious attacks, etc. 9. Other technologies: security technologies such as Web Application Firewall (WAF), reverse proxy, etc., can evaluate and test the application before it is deployed in the production environment.
