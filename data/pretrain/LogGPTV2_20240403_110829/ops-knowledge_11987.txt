User: I was finally getting to the point where I had some free time and wanted to add Celery to my Python/Flask project on Heroku. However, almost all mentions of Celery from the Heroku docs are gone. There used to be article with a tutotial in the "Getting started with Django", but it's gone.
Will "just doing it" myself work? What's a good AMQP addon to use as backend on Heroku?
Assistant: I think there are issues with Celery as a background task on Heroku. We tried to create such tasks and they take all memory after running for about 20 minutes, even with DEBUG=False on Redis or RabbitMQ. Worse still, the memory is NEVER released: every time we have to restart the worker. 
The same code runs flawlessly on bare Linux or on Mac with Foreman.
It happens with very simple tasks, like reading a text file in a loop, writing to a Django model.
