User: Please explain what is software quality assurance (SQA) and provide three key steps to implement SQA.
Assistant: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) refers to the monitoring and control of various methods, techniques and processes in the software development process to ensure that the quality of software products meets expected standards and requirements. SQA is a preventive activity aimed at discovering and eliminating problems in the early stage of software development, preventing software defects and errors, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of software development. The following are three key steps to implement SQA: 1. Develop SQA plan: determine the goals and scope of SQA, develop testing strategies and methods, develop evaluation procedures, etc. 2. Review and audit: Review and audit the process, documents and codes of software development to ensure compliance with standards and specifications, and provide feedback and suggestions. 3. Testing and verification: Conduct various tests, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, etc., to verify software functionality, performance, security, etc., and to discover and resolve software defects and errors. At the same time, user acceptance testing can also be carried out to ensure that the software product meets user needs and expectations.
