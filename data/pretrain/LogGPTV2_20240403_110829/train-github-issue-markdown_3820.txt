I have not found any examples addressing this specific scenario, so I will explain my situation as follows:

I have a custom transformer that has already been fit to some data. My goal is to use this pre-fit transformer in a pipeline alongside a model that has not yet been fit to the transformed data. The key requirement is to retain the existing fit of the transformer without re-fitting it to new data, and to only fit the model within the pipeline.

Currently, when I attempt to do this, I encounter an error indicating that the model must be fit first. 

The alternatives I can think of are:
1. Manually transform the data using the pre-fit transformer, then train the model on the transformed data, and finally combine them into a `Pipeline`.
2. Create the `Pipeline` first, and then fit the components step by step, ensuring the transformer is not re-fitted.

Is there a more efficient or recommended way to achieve this goal while maintaining the pre-fit state of the transformer?
