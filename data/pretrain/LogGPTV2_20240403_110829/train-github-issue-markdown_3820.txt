I couldn't find any examples of this anywhere so here goes.
What I have in mind is this:  
I have an already fit custom transformer and i want to use it in a pipeline
with a model that is not fit to the transformed data yet.
The goal is to keep the old fit transformer without refiting it to the new
data and only fit the model, all combined in a Pipeline().  
Currently, if I try to do that I get and error that the model has to be fit
first.
The only alternative i can think of is transforming the data, training the
model with it and then combining them into a Pipeline(). Or creating the
Pipeline() and then fitting them step by step.
