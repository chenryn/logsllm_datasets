    > -   2 or 3 systems or VMs, networked together
    >
    > -   RHEL 6 (eval), CENTOS 6 (when available), or Fedora (Fedora 13
    >     will be closest to RHEL 6)
    >
    > -   Red Hat docs at:
    >

# The Red Hat Certification Landscape
-   RHCSA
    > RHCSA is new, replacing the RHCT. It is the \"core\" sysadmin
    > certification from Red Hat. To earn RHCE and other system
    > administration certs will require first earning the RHCSA.
-   RHCE
    > RHCE is a senior system administration certification. It is an
    > eligibility requirement for taking any COE exams and is thus a
    > requirement for the upper-level credentials as well.
-   Certificates of Expertise
    > COEs are incremental credentials demonstrating skills and
    > knowledge in specialized areas. They are worthy credentials in
    > their own right, but also the building blocks of the upper level
    > credentials.
-   RHCSS, RHCDS, RHCA
    > These upper level credentials recognize those who have achieved
    > expertise in several related specialized areas. Each one requires
    > multiple COEs.

Exam Objectives
RHCE exam candidates should consult the RHCSA Exam Objectives document
and be capable of RHCSA-level tasks, as some of these skills may be
required in order to meet RHCE exam objectives. Red Hat reserves the
right to add, modify and remove objectives. Such changes will be made
public in advance through revisions to this document.
RHCE exam candidates should be able to accomplish the following without
assistance. These have been grouped into several categories.
