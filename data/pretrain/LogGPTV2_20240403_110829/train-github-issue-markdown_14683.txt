This is part of the Rust tutorial session. The whole purpose of the exercise
was to find a mistake in the block expression.
See Exercise 2.1  
http://pnkfelix.github.io/cyot/tutorial/exercises/ex_part_2
With rust compile this:
    fn foo() -> i32 {
       42
    }
    pub fn main() {
        let the_sum :i32 = {
            foo();
        };
        let the_other_sum = {
            foo();
        };
    }
It outputs this error:
    bug_block.rs:7:24: 9:6 error: mismatched types:
     expected `i32`,
        found `()`
    (expected i32,
        found ()) [E0308]
    bug_block.rs:7     let the_sum :i32 = {
    bug_block.rs:8         foo();
    bug_block.rs:9     };
    error: aborting due to previous error
It should also put a warning for line 12: "possibly missing return value".
This would catch the bug.
