User: How to design website disaster recovery to avoid single point of failure and ensure website availability?
Assistant: 1. Dual-system hot backup: In the same computer room, through two servers with the same configuration, two-way synchronization between the main machine and the standby machine is realized. When the main machine fails, the standby machine will immediately take over the work of the main machine. 2. Load balancing: Establish multiple server clusters, and use load balancing devices to achieve balanced distribution of access requests and reduce the burden on a single server. 3. CDN acceleration: By using CDN (Content Delivery Network), static resource files (such as pictures, JS, CSS, etc.) are distributed on node servers around the world, allowing users to visit nearby, improving website speed and stability. 4. Database disaster recovery: Configure database master-slave replication to realize data backup and synchronization. When the primary database fails, the backup database can quickly take over. At the same time, it is recommended to deploy the database separately on a high-availability server to ensure data security and stability. 5. Distributed cache: By using distributed cache technologies such as Redis and Memcached, cache clusters can be implemented to improve request response speed and avoid access delays and data loss caused by single node failures. 6. Remote disaster recovery: deploy multiple computer rooms, and each computer room backs up each other. When a computer room fails, the request will automatically switch to other computer rooms to ensure business continuity. At the same time, it is recommended to establish off-site backup for data replication to avoid catastrophic data loss. 7. Monitoring and early warning: realize real-time monitoring and analysis of key information such as system status, service, hardware resources, security, etc., early warning and alarm, timely detection and resolution of problems, and ensure the availability of the website.
