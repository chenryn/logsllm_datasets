##### Description of the problem
I seems that DirectGeometry.fromGeometry creates duplicate vertices. In this
line of code vertices are created when looping through faces, not vertices.
This result in duplicate vertices.
I think this is unintended, or am I missing something?.
This problem effects BufferGeometry (via fromGeometry) and means the WebGL
renderer needs to do ~6x as much work.
Working example:
  * JSFiddle
To replicate this, convert a geometry to buffer geometry and back again. Then
compare the vertices as below:
    // extract from jsfiddle
    var bufferGeom = new THREE.BufferGeometry()
    bufferGeom.fromGeometry(geometry)
    var newGeom = geometry.clone()
    newGeom.fromBufferGeometry(bufferGeom)
    if (newGeom.vertices.length != geometry.vertices.length) {
      console.error('The new geometry has ', newGeom.vertices.length, 'vertices while the geometry only had ', geometry.vertices.length)
    }
