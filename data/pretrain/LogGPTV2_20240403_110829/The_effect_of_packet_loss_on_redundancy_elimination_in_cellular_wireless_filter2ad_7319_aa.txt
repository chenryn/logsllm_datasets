## Abstract
Network-level redundancy elimination (RE) algorithms reduce traffic volume on bandwidth-constrained network paths by avoiding the transmission of repeated byte sequences. Previous research has shown that RE can suppress the transmission of 20-50% of bytes when deployed at ISP access links or between routers. This paper focuses on the challenges of deploying RE in cellular networks, where the potential benefits are substantial due to the growing subscriber base and often oversubscribed network links, including wired backhaul. Using three large traces captured at two North American and one European wireless network providers, we demonstrate that RE can reduce the bandwidth consumption of most mobile users by at least 10%. However, cellular links have much higher packet loss rates compared to wired counterparts, which complicates the application of RE. Our experiments show that even a few lost packets can disrupt RE and eliminate the bandwidth savings. We propose informed marking, a lightweight scheme that detects lost packets and prevents RE algorithms from using them for future encodings. We implement RE with informed marking and deploy it in a real-world cellular network. Our results indicate that with informed marking, more than 60% of the bandwidth savings of RE are preserved, even when packet loss rates are high.

## 1. Introduction
Cellular wireless networks are increasingly becoming the primary medium for Internet access, with cellular devices set to overtake PCs as the most common web access devices worldwide. The increasing subscriber base and richer applications strain the capacity of both the cellular wireless links and the wired backhaul network connecting cell towers to the Internet. Network-level redundancy elimination (RE) has emerged as an efficient way to reduce traffic volume on bandwidth-constrained network paths. RE relies on deploying a cache at each end of the network path, where the ingress node finds common sequences of bytes within previously sent packets and replaces them with fixed-size pointers to the cache. At the egress, packets are decoded by replacing encoded content with data from the cache. Previous work has shown that RE can suppress the transmission of 22-50% of bytes at ISP access links. 

Cellular network links are ideal candidates for RE due to their bandwidth constraints, but applying RE to these networks is not straightforward. Packet loss in the radio network can cause the caches to become unsynchronized, hindering the decoding of repeated content. In this paper, we study the feasibility of network-level redundancy elimination in high-loss environments such as cellular wireless networks. Using packet-level simulation driven by three large cellular traces and live experimentation on a North American CDMA 1x-EvDO network, we show that even the loss of a few packets can eliminate the bandwidth savings obtained with RE. To mitigate the impact of packet loss on RE, we propose informed marking, a simple mechanism to detect lost packets and prevent RE from using them in future encodings. Our results show that with informed marking, more than 60% of the bandwidth savings of RE are preserved, even when packet loss rates are high.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Cellular Wireless Networks
A cellular wireless network consists of a radio access network (RAN) that connects to the Internet via a packet data network (PDN) gateway. The PDN gateway aggregates data from multiple radio network controllers (RNCs), which receive mobile traffic over the air using base stations and wireless antennas. Data packets sent or received over the RAN are tunneled between the mobile devices and the PDN gateway. The primary bandwidth bottleneck in wireless networks is the airlink between the mobile users and the RNC. While 4G technologies like LTE promise to increase peak rates to 100 Mbps, their deployment is expensive and may still result in bottlenecks.

### 2.2 Redundancy Elimination Overview
Network-level redundancy elimination (RE) is an efficient method to reduce traffic volume on bandwidth-constrained network paths. RE algorithms deploy a packet cache at each end of a network path. Outgoing packets are compressed by replacing sequences of bytes that have appeared in earlier packets with fixed-size pointers to the cached version. At the other end, packets are decoded by following the pointers and replacing encoded content with data from the cache. For correct and efficient operation, the two caches must be synchronized.

RE works because network traffic contains significant amounts of repeated content. Previous studies have found 20-50% redundancy in traffic collected at enterprise access links. Many commercial systems use RE in WAN optimization middleboxes placed on ISP access links. The EndRE system proposed to push RE capabilities to end hosts, but neither middleboxes nor EndRE are suitable for cellular wireless networks. Middleboxes cannot reduce traffic volume on last-mile access links, and while EndRE can compress last-mile traffic, it is less effective for data streams that do not require reliable delivery (e.g., UDP). Additionally, deploying EndRE on all servers that mobile users connect to is challenging due to the rapid increase in mobile users and applications.

### 2.3 RE over Cellular Wireless Links
To efficiently reduce traffic volume over the radio network, RE must be performed between each mobile user and the PDN gateway, requiring one cache on the mobile device and another on the gateway. However, high packet loss rates in the radio network can create inconsistencies between caches and prevent RE from functioning correctly. A packet that enters the sender's cache but is subsequently lost will appear useful for encoding, but the receiver will not be able to decode any subsequent packet that refers to the lost one.

To measure packet loss rates in wireless networks, we conducted an experiment using a stationary laptop connected to the Internet through a CDMA 1xEV-DO USB wireless card. We used wget to download the front page of the 500 most popular web servers and tcpdump to capture all network traffic during the downloads. The retransmission rate was computed, which can be viewed as an upper bound for the packet loss rate. The results showed that the retransmission rate oscillated between 0.001 and 0.10, with peaks of over 0.30. In Section 3.4, we analyze the effect of loss rates on the bandwidth savings obtained with RE and show that even small loss rates can affect the correctness of RE.

## 3. Normal Redundancy Elimination in a Lossy Environment
In this section, we analyze three cellular wireless traffic data sets and show that many mobile users can reduce their traffic volume with RE. We also demonstrate, using simulations and live experiments, that lost packets can significantly degrade the performance of RE.

### 3.1 Data Sets
We analyze three network traces collected using tcpdump at PDN gateways in two North American and one European 3G wireless service provider (WSP) networks. Table 1 shows the properties of each trace. We selected the top k users that have sent or received the largest amount of traffic in each trace, setting k to 2,000 for WSP-1 and to 100 for WSP-2 and WSP-3. This ensures that the top k users are responsible for more than 80% of the traffic we capture in each network.

### 3.2 RE Algorithm Basics
We use the RE algorithm developed by Spring et al. (commonly known as modp). For each packet, modp identifies content present in earlier packets by generating a list of fingerprints associated with the packet. A fingerprint is a hash over a continuous sequence of bytes of length w. It is impractical to store all fingerprints generated by a packet, so modp chooses a fraction 1/p and stores only the fingerprints with value 0 mod p. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of fingerprints.
