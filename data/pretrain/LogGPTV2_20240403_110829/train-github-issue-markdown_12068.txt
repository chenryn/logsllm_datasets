### Problem Description

**Component Version-Release Number:**
Not applicable.

**Reproducibility:**
Always.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add an IPv6 address to the network interface `p14p14`:
   ```sh
   ip addr add fe80::1 dev p14p14
   ```

2. Start a netcat listener on port 1234 using IPv6:
   ```sh
   nc -6 -l 1234
   ```

3. Attempt to send a GET request to the netcat listener using Python's `requests` library:
   ```python
   python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://[fe80::1%25p14p1]:1234')"
   ```

4. Verify the connection with a verbose netcat command:
   ```sh
   nc -v6 'fe80::1%p14p1' 1234
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Ncat: Version 6.40 ( http://nmap.org/ncat )
   Ncat: Connected to fe80::1:1234.
   ```

### Actual Results

The Python script fails and shows the following traceback:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>

    r = adapter.send(request, **kwargs)

    raise ConnectionError(e)
requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPConnectionPool(host='fe80::1%25p14p1', port=1234): Max retries exceeded with url: / (Caused by NewConnectionError('<requests.packages.urllib3.connection.HTTPConnection object at 0x7f8b2c0e7d50>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name or service not known'))
```

### Expected Results

The Python `requests` library should successfully connect to the netcat listener.

### Additional Information

- Relevant RFC: [RFC 6874](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6874) (IPv6 Zone Identifiers)

This issue may be related to how the `requests` library handles IPv6 zone identifiers.
