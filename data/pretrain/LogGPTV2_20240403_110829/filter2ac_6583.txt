**Title: Understanding the IoT Threat Landscape and a Home Appliance Manufacturer's Approach to Counter IoT Threats**

In todayâ€™s interconnected world, where billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices are linked to the Internet, news reports frequently highlight the damage caused by malware and other threats targeting these devices. While users can take some precautions, consumers increasingly expect manufacturers to integrate security into the product design and development lifecycle.

As a leading device manufacturer, Panasonic has taken proactive steps to address this challenge. We have connected our own devices in the development and pre-shipment phases to a honeypot system we have developed. This allows us to gather valuable information on emerging threats. Since its deployment, Panasonic has identified 179 million attack cases and 25,000 malware samples, including 4,800 unique samples specifically targeting IoT devices. Notably, 20% of these samples were new, with no existing hashes available on VirusTotal. Additionally, we have uncovered zero-day attacks against the SMB protocol, which could potentially allow attackers to access data on compromised home appliances.

To address the challenge of having a limited number of security experts, we have developed an automated system where the information collected through the honeypot is sent to a sandbox for analysis. This system enables Panasonic to collect and analyze both "malware targeting/exploiting Panasonic IoT devices" and "popular malware" that affects a wide range of IoT devices, facilitating quicker remediation.

In this session, we will delve into the details of this project and share insights from the analysis of the collected malware. By leveraging this information, Panasonic aims to develop products that are more resilient to malware. Furthermore, we are exploring ways to use this threat and remediation data to establish an IoT Security Operations Center (SOC).

**Key Takeaways:**
- The importance of integrating security into the product design and development lifecycle.
- The effectiveness of using honeypots to gather threat intelligence.
- The significance of automating the analysis process to manage the volume of threats.
- Strategies for developing more resilient IoT devices and establishing an IoT SOC.
