### Title: An Insider's Biopsy of Healthcare Application Security

Healthcare security teams face significant challenges. While the healthcare industry is increasingly prioritizing security, it remains heavily dependent on software vendors that provide critical data delivery, processing, and storage solutions. These systems are essential for delivering patient care and safeguarding patient data. However, this reliance raises a crucial question: how secure are these solutions?

Seth Fogie, with over a decade of experience in the healthcare sector, has witnessed both the strengths and weaknesses of the technology provided to healthcare providers. As an insider, Seth has experienced the unique pressures faced by healthcare security teams as they strive to implement these solutions securely. In this presentation, he will share his insights and findings.

The core focus of the presentation will be on vulnerabilities and design issues within healthcare solutions. Through the dissection of various clinical systems—such as radiology reading, EMR downtime, patient entertainment, pharmacy distribution, nurse communication, M&A EMR, clinical documentation, and temperature monitoring systems—the prognosis appears grim. Our experience indicates that few hospital enterprise solutions are without significant issues.

The goal of this public "biopsy" is to raise awareness and increase pressure on ensuring the security of all healthcare data. While we cannot name and shame specific vendors for various reasons, we aim to highlight numerous technical issues and call for greater scrutiny of all healthcare solutions. This is not just an application security problem; it is a matter of protecting our collective healthcare data. The audience is uniquely positioned to help drive this change.
