User: I'm using Django and PyDev/Eclipse. I just installed django-treebeard with setup.py install and it got installed in my site-packages directory C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages. I can successfully import it in the python shell with import treebeard. However PyDev complains that it cannot resolve it when I try to import it. 
Unfortunately I have no experience with PyDev and I assumed that it would automatically pick up everything in the site-packages directory but apparently it does not. What am I missing?
thanks
Assistant: I've found that closing the project and reopening (after rescanning the interpreter) works for me.
