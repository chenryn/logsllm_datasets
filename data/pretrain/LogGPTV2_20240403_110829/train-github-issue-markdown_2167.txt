When using the `kubectl create` command with a list, it no longer functions as expected. The following error message is displayed:

```shell
$ _output/local/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl create -f /tmp/test.json
error validating "/tmp/test.json": error validating data: couldn't find type: v1.List; if you choose to ignore these errors, turn validation off with --validate=false
```

To resolve this issue, you can either ensure that the JSON file is correctly formatted and contains the appropriate types, or you can disable validation by adding the `--validate=false` flag to your `kubectl create` command. 

For example:
```shell
_output/local/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl create -f /tmp/test.json --validate=false
```

This will bypass the validation step and allow the creation of the resources specified in the JSON file.
