3.1.4
Impact of the Interval Size
We next analyze the impact of the interval size by
computing ﬂow metrics for a full day of data using dif-
ferent interval sizes. We select a 10-minute reference
interval within which we can search eﬃciently for ﬂow
fragments and pairs. In Figure 1 we show the impact
of the interval size with respect to the 10-minute (600
secs) interval. We observe, as expected, that longer in-
tervals lead to slightly lower ﬂow counts as fewer ﬂows
cross interval boundaries. This decrease is less for two-
way ﬂows due to their longer duration. oWe observe
that doubling the interval size slightly decreases abso-
lute count metrics by 3-5%. On the other hand, the

on rules summarized in Table 3 that can be eas-
ily reviewed and veriﬁed both by researchers and
network operators. Traﬃc classiﬁcation schemes
should be easily understandable to be engaged and
deployed by network operators.
• Extensibility: Our classiﬁer can be easily ex-
tended with additional traﬃc features and clas-
siﬁcation rules. For example, if a ﬂow monitor
is conﬁgured to collect additional data, like TCP
ﬂags, then these can be easily integrated into new
or existing classiﬁcation rules.
We classify one-way ﬂows using a two step process
that resembles the way medical diagnosis identiﬁes the
cause of a health problem. We ﬁrst deﬁne a set of
signs, which are informative attributes for digging into
the cause of one-way ﬂows. We then check each ﬂow
against all signs and ﬁnd the ones it matches. Finally,
we classify a ﬂow based on the collection of signs that
are present or absent. Our classiﬁcation scheme is based
on a carefully designed set of rules that take as input
the signs of a ﬂow and determine the appropriate class,
including the unknown class.
4.1 Signs
Flow signs are derived from sign tests. A sign test de-
termines if a ﬂow exhibits a speciﬁc sign and may be as
simple as checking a ﬂow feature value or as complex as
performing a behavioral assessment of an involved end-
host. We introduce in total 18 signs exploiting in 4 cases
techniques from the literature that have been shown ef-
fective for detecting scan and peer-to-peer traﬃc. We
classify our signs in four categories based on the entity
they characterize: 1) a pair of communicating hosts, 2)
a remote host as a source of an one-way ﬂow, 3) a lo-
cal host as a target of an one-way ﬂow, or 4) a ﬂow.
In Table 2 we summarize our signs and show in which
category they belong.
4.1.1 Host-Pair Signs
Host-pair signs characterize a pair of end-hosts with
an one-way ﬂow. They reﬂect the mix of one- and two-
way ﬂows of a host pair. In Figure 2 the graphs a to d il-
lustrate communication patterns that correspond to the
four possible combinations of a biﬂow and an outﬂow
between a host pair with an inﬂow. Hosts are repre-
sented by nodes, where the local host is the node in the

metrics aggregated for a full day. The decrease
of the fraction of one-way to total ﬂows is not
more than 1.2% for a doubled interval size.
decrease of the relative volume of one-way ﬂows is only
1.2% and does not decrease further with an increas-
ing interval size. Therefore, we conclude that with a
10-minute interval absolute count metrics slightly over-
estimate the number of ﬂows, while relative count met-
rics, which is the type of metrics we primarily report,
are very accurate.
4. ONE-WAY TRAFFIC CLASSIFICATION
Our classiﬁcation scheme has the following key fea-
tures:
• Flow-based Classiﬁcation: We leverage solely
ﬂow monitoring data, i.e., NetFlow. Compared to
packet-level data and DPI that have been used in
the past to monitor IBR traﬃc, ﬂow monitoring
provides fewer details, but is less expensive, scales
better to monitoring large IP address blocks, and
is more generally available.
• Easy Conﬁguration: Our classiﬁer does not re-
quire training, which is a drawback of many traﬃc
classiﬁcation techniques.
It can be applied with
minimal conﬁguration, without extensive overhead.
• Comprehensibility: We use legible rules instead
of complex classiﬁcation structures, like self-organizing
maps, to make our classiﬁer comprehensible to non-
machine-learning experts. Our scheme is based

old Random Walk (TRW) [16] algorithm, which uses
sequential hypothesis testing to qualify a remote host
as scanner or benign (or undecidable). We denote these
signs with “TRWscan” and “TRWnom”. The second
algorithm [2] is a variant of TRW that inspects the be-
havior of a remote host in a relaxed way and classiﬁes
it as a scanner if a test condition is met. A negative
test result is not supported, i.e., it does not qualify a
host as benign. The test assesses the service fanout of a
remote host, i.e., the count of 2-tuples {dstIP,dstPort}
the host attempted to access, and its overall success in
connection establishment. Each connection attempt is
qualiﬁed either as “good” if it results in a two-way ﬂow
or as “bad” if it results in an one-way ﬂow. This way,
a remote host is classiﬁed as a scanner if it has a bad
service fanout larger than two times the good service
fanout (and at least 4). The host classiﬁcation is done
in a ﬁrst pass. During a second pass any ﬂow sourced by
a classiﬁed scanner is labeled with the sign “HCscan”.
Both algorithms restrict their tests to 30 minute time
windows to keep memory demands in bounds.
4.1.3 Local Host Signs
We use three signs to characterize local hosts within
the monitored network. We mark with the sign unused
local address (“GreyIP”) local IP addresses that never
sourced any ﬂow over a full observation period of 400
hours and, therefore, are unpopulated.
We introduce the sign service unreachable to trace
outages of well-known services. We deﬁne a service as
an endpoint described by the 3-tuple {localIP, protocol,
localPort} with the constraint that the port number is
well-known, i.e., below 1024. We consider only TCP
and UDP ﬂows. We consider a local service valid if it
serves at least 20 clients during any 30-minute interval
over a full observation period. We label one-way ﬂows
that target valid services with the sign service unreach-
able (“Unreach”).
The sign peer-to-peer marks one-way ﬂows caused by
stale host caches of P2P applications. Behavioral P2P
application identiﬁcation has been studied extensively [17,
25, 15]. We make use of three rules from the literature
(H1,2,3 from [15]) that identify a local host as a member
of a P2P network based on the observation of typical

ﬂows exchanged between a host pair shown as a
graph. Hosts are represented by nodes and the

left, and ﬂows with arrows. We use the sign end-hosts-
communicating to mark one-way ﬂows between hosts
that are involved in a productive communication, i.e.,
they have a biﬂow between them, with occasional failed
connections, i.e., one-way ﬂows. We assign this sign to
one-way ﬂows with the communication pattern shown
in the graphs b and d in Figure 2.
Furthermore, we introduce a sign called “InOut” to
capture the pattern of graph c in Figure 2. In particu-
lar, the “InOut” sign identiﬁes host pair communication
situations in which an one-way ICMP ﬂow is a reply to
another outgoing one-way ﬂow exchanged between the
same host pair. We assign ICMP one-way ﬂows with the
sign “InOut” to a special class that includes suspected
benign one-way ﬂows.
4.1.2 Remote Host Signs
We use four signs to characterize remote hosts that
generate one-way ﬂows towards the monitored network.
If we observe one-way ﬂows from a well-known source
port of a remote host to a local ephemeral port and
at the same time we do not observe any two-way ﬂows
nor opposite direction one-way ﬂows between the two
hosts, then we assign the service sole reply sign. We
use this sign to detect backscatter from attack traﬃc
towards a service of the remote host. We check for the
absence of biﬂows within a 30-minute time interval to
limit computational overhead.
Besides, we leverage two state-of-the-art algorithms
to detect remote scanners. We introduce three signs
that describe either a positive or a negative test result.
The ﬁrst two signs are based on the well-known Thresh-
5
a)b)c)d)P2P behavioral patterns. We require that at least 2 out
of 3 P2P rules is matched or a match occurs for at least
5 time windows of 30 minute duration. First, we pre-
pare a list with detected local P2P hosts by analyzing
two-way ﬂows of a full observation period. Then, we
mark any TCP/UDP one-way ﬂow targeted at a high
port towards such hosts with the peer-to-peer sign.
4.1.4 Flow Signs
The remaining signs are either direct ﬂow attributes
or are derived from them by the rules shown in Table 2.
The sign artifact is used for TCP and UDP ﬂows with
both port numbers set to zero. Such ﬂows are the result
of packet fragments for which the correct port numbers
are not available due to the missing layer-4 header. If
a ﬂow contains a source address that belongs to bogon
space using the data of [8] then we mark it with the sign
