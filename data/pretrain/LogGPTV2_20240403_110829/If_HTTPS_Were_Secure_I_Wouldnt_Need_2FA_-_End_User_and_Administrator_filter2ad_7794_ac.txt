mental models are visually highlighted.
4) Anti-model of HTTPS: In contrast to the correct model
of HTTPS but similar to the incorrect model of message
encryption, the characteristics of this model are as follows:
• a centralized blackbox HTTPS proxy is responsible for
authentication and/or encryption.
• the user’s browser sends a request/message along with
a code to the HTTPS proxy. The code is used to encrypt
the data.
• if more security is required (e.g., in the case of online
banking), the user sends an additional second factor to
the HTTPS proxy, which then adds an additional layer
of encryption.
• decryption is not part of the model. The server/website
receives encrypted data, but it is unclear how it is then
processed.
• omnipotent attackers such as intelligence agencies and
surveillance programs, “hackers” but also ad trackers can
attack the HTTPS proxy and eavesdrop information.
• cookies (represented by a gingerbread ﬁgure) may leak
information via the browser.
• smartphone apps are generally perceived as insecure,
regardless of whether HTTPS is used or not.
End users, especially, (8 participants) thought
that mobile
devices and apps are not safe to be used in this context, as
sensitive information may be leaked. Also, the idea of multiple
layers of encryption using a code and an additional 2nd
factor was mostly part of end user mental models. Omnipotent
attackers and a fairly negative security assessment are part
of both administrators’ and end users’ mental models. This
model underestimates the security of HTTPS and does not
contain keys, certiﬁcates, or security indicators. Interestingly,
this is the only of the four meta-models that acknowledges
the existence of metadata. Twelve participant drawings feature
elements from this incorrect model of HTTPS (10 end user
models and 2 administrator models also contained elements
of this model).
B. Mental Model Components and Emerging Themes
We discuss themes and particular aspects that emerged
during the drawing tasks and corresponding think-aloud
protocol. Table IV shows a selection of quantitative results
per assigned codes where differences between groups are
particularly interesting. The codes in parenthesis refer to the
category codes (see Appendix F).
1) User Expectations of Security Tools: When asked of
which encrypted tools, apps or devices they were aware,
end users mostly referred to mobile apps (15 participants) and
sensitive services such as banking services (14 participants)
or phone calls (1 participant). At the same time, nine end
users self-reported a lack of knowledge (see blue bars in
Figure 9). In contrast, administrators (red bars) mentioned
a broad spectrum of tools and applications, ranging from
browsers (7 participants), email services (7 participants), and
privacy preserving technologies such as VPN, SSH or Tor
(6 participants) to local encryption such as disk encryption
(1 participant) and remote encryption such as servers (4
participants). Interestingly, 8 end-users and 2 administrators
explicitly stated that mobile apps are generally not encrypted
and hence, untrustworthy. One end user
reported
to avoid mobile apps to handle sensitive data and that he
accesses sensitive services, such as online banking, solely via
the browser on his PC. This is in line with ﬁndings by Chin
et al. [50] showing that users are commonly apprehensive
about running sensitive tasks on their phones. Notably, eight
non-experts and two administrators speciﬁcally brought up
WhatsApp as a negative example of an application that is
not or only partly encrypted. This implies that either the
messaging app’s initiative to offer end-to-end encryption did
not yet reach all of its users or that users do not trust the
service.
(U04)
2) Mistrust in HTTPS and Browser Security Indicators:
When it comes to expectations of visiting a site with
HTTPS, nine end users reported a lack of knowledge, and
some even claimed that they have never noticed the security
indicator before as shown in Figure 6. One participant mixed
up the HTTPS lock symbol with user authentication resp.
authorization:
“I think the lock symbol means that I have to authen-
ticate myself. As I frequently forget my passwords, I
usually try to click around to get rid of this symbol.”
(U12)

Another dominant theme was the underestimation of the
security beneﬁts of HTTPS. For example, one end user
articulated
“The lock symbol puts security in people’s mind
with the purpose to build up trust. This does not
mean that the website is secure.” (P01)
As discussed by Felt et al. [18], security indicators are
a critical UI component of modern browsers. The results
from our study, however, suggest
that security indicators
are rarely part of user mental models. Twenty participants
did not include security indicators in their drawings and the
associated think-aloud protocol. One participant explicitly
used an insecurity indicator in their drawing (note that the
interviews were conducted shortly before Chrome started
notifying users of unencrypted connections). The other
participants referred to either the lock icon (5) and/or the
HTTPS preﬁx (5) in their drawings.
3) Perceived Security Beneﬁts of HTTPS: With respect to
security perceptions, the elicited mental models were rather
diverse. Eight out of the 18 end users from our study clearly
underestimated the security beneﬁt of HTTPS. Six end users
had a realistic assessment of the security of HTTPS and
understood that HTTPS encrypts the entire transport layer
instead of just single data elements such as a username and a
password, or a credit card number. U09 explicitly stated that
he had no deeper understanding of keys, certiﬁcates, and other
system components, but had a (correct) basic understanding of
the underlying concept of transport layer encryption.
In the context of the two HTTPS-related drawing tasks, the
participant said:
“I expect the connection to the online shop to be
secure (or insecure), irrespective of whether I want
to buy a pen or a house.” (U09)
A few participants also misunderstood the security beneﬁts
of HTTPS and assumed that it prevents any form of data
leakage (2 non-experts) and can even prevent phishing attacks
(3 non-experts). One participant imagined HTTPS to be a
completely encapsulated system where all attempts to attack
the sensitive information are bounced off.
“HTTPS inhibits tracking, it is a completely encap-
sulated system that does not share the data.” (U03)
Another participant (end user) perceived HTTPS as a tunnel
between him and a server:
“The connection between me and the server goes via
a tunnel, and attempts to attack the data bounce off”
(U09)
One administrator, also, described HTTPS and the attacker
model as a tunnel:
“SSL is like a tunnel, and data can be pushed
through this tunnel.” (A04)
Irrespective of security indicators, many participants ex-
pressed general distrust towards encrypted connections.
“I always feel queasy, anyway. Nothing on the
Internet is secure.” (U01)
Fig. 6. Reported expectations on HTTPS. Each bar indicates how often a
certain category was named in relation to all namings. (Multiple mentions
per participant)
This shows that users still do not properly recognize the
HTTPS security indicator, although much work has focused
on improvements in this area. End users described their
expectation of HTTPS on a superﬁcial level, using general
terms related to security and eavesdropping protection without
further elaboration. Three participants wrongly assumed that
HTTPS would protect against phishing, and one participant
thought that HTTPS could ban viruses. Interestingly, one end
user stated that
“HTTPS prevents people from seeing what
their
partner did on the Internet or the employer from
seeing whether employees were not working when
they should have been.” (U12)
None of the end users mentioned server authentication.
In contrast, six administrators named end-to-end encryption
and ﬁve server authentication. However, we observed that
administrators described the two concepts decoupled from
each other, which is in accordance with the ﬁnding from Fahl
et al. [10] that administrators are not aware of the necessity
of server authentication when establishing a secure encrypted
channel.
Another emerging topic was mistrust in the security in-
in HTTPS as a protocol. Generally,
dicator and mistrust
we were surprised about
the high frequency of expressed
mistrust against HTTPS and the security indicator coming
from both end users (7 participants) and administrators (6
participants). One administrator stated that HTTPS does not
offer eavesdropping protection, claiming
“The lock symbol does not mean anything, it is pure
marketing”. (A06)
After this statement, we asked the participant a series of
follow-up questions to allow him to clarify. As a result, the
participant referred to powerful attackers and large (govern-
ment) organizations and said that the arms race with powerful
attackers is almost impossible to win for defenders.

Seven non-experts
it promises. However,
While for some types of attacks (e.g. phishing, malicious
Javascript, or drive-by downloads) this is a true statement, this
was not the type of attack to which the participants typically
referred. Surprisingly, most participants questioned the protec-
tion mechanisms against attacks that HTTPS can protect them
against (e.g., third parties stealing their passwords/credit card
numbers when submitting a web form to an online shop).
and six administrators
expressed
general doubts about whether cryptography can achieve
what
the participants considered
cryptography necessary to protect various assets. Thirteen
out of 18 end users mentioned sensitive data related to
purchases or personal information as crucial to be protected
by cryptography. Administrators again showcased a more
diverse idea,
referring to sensitive data (2 participants),
protocol speciﬁc data (1 participant), as well as local data
(1 participant) or data in transit (2 participants). Both end
users and administrators had a similar picture of successful
attackers, believing that
the state respectively the police
or secret service (26 participants) as well as hackers (19
participants) and big companies such as Apple, Facebook, or
Google (18 participants) are the most persistent attackers.
4) Centralized Components and Authorities: Another
emerging theme was centralization vs. decentralization and
powerful authorities. Eleven end users included a centralized
encryption entity in their drawings, i.e., a remote service that
is responsible for encryption and then forwards the encrypted
data to the communication partner (as in the ﬁrst scenario)
or to the online shop (second scenario). In other models, the
centralized component acted as a message release point that
1) checks the message for suspicious content and validity, 2)
encrypts it, and then 3) forwards it to the receiver. Comparing
our ﬁndings to related work, we observe that end users
perceive other de-centralized cryptographic tools as centralized
systems, e.g., Tor [35] or use centralized components since
they are perceived as more trustworthy, e.g., hosted wallets to
manage bitcoins [51].
An interesting observation is that only one participant
(U08) included key generation in their model. All other
participants implicitly or explicitly assumed that the key was
already there by default and did not include key generation in
their models. Only a few participants discussed key exchange
as part of their drawing and explanation as shown in Table IV.
5) Authentication vs. Encryption: Furthermore, misconcep-
tions about the differences between encryption and authenti-
cation emerged as a theme for both groups of participants.
Both end users and administrators from our sample confused
encryption with authentication. In general, 13 users expressed
concerns regarding the protocol’s security promises. Especially
when it comes to 2-Factor-Authentication (2FA), a common
misconception of end users was that the secondary factor was
used to add an additional layer of encryption. Participant U11
argued that 2FA is required for online banking to compensate
the lack of security provided by HTTPS.
“HTTPS is a bad protocol. If HTTPS were secure,
I wouldn’t need 2FA.” (U11)
6) Differences between Administrators and End Users: For
both groups of participants, mental models were diverse even
among experienced administrators.
When asked about how they think encryption works in
theory, 10 of 12 administrator drawings reﬂected concepts
of end-to-end encryption. In comparison, fewer than 50% of
the end user drawings clearly depicted end-to-end encryption.
Four end users incorporated symmetric keys in their drawings
and two explicitly mentioned private and public keys without
being able to further elaborate why two keys are necessary. In
contrast, seven administrators explicitly referred to asymmetric
encryption in their drawings and the think-aloud protocol.
More than half of the end user mental models referred to a
third party that acts as encryption entity or proxy, or, referred
to encryption as a blackbox. One participant (U03) used
ephemeral keys and anther one (U15) thought that encryption
was the same thing as obfuscation and steganography. In
contrast, none of the administrators’ drawings reﬂected such
misconceptions.
While comparing the differences between administrators
and end users, a theme emerged, protocol-based vs. concep-
tual. Our results suggest that expert mental models are mostly
protocol-based instead of conceptual compared to non-experts.
Most administrators were familiar with speciﬁc protocol char-
acteristics, such as which messages are exchanged between
server and client and how connections are established.
When asked to explain the underlying concepts, most ad-
ministrators were unable to explain how HTTPS works and
had sparse mental models of the underlying fundamentals
and their interplay. This was often the case even for the
ﬁrst drawing task, which asked participants to depict how
sending an encrypted message through any channel works in
theory. Even in such a straight-forward scenario for knowl-
edgeable users, some administrators showed and even admitted
signiﬁcant knowledge gaps. However, we also observed that
administrators concealed these gaps more frequently and ran-
domly dropped associated technical terms without being able
to explain what they mean. Some participants, though (such
as A09), explicitly admitted major knowledge gaps:
“How HTTPS works... those are the things that I
always forget. You should have asked me ﬁve years
ago.” (A09)
Another example of an administrator lacking conceptual
knowledge but getting stuck on a conﬁguration detail was
participant A4, who said:
“I am really not sure how Firefox validates certiﬁ-
cates, but I know that Chrome uses the Windows
Root CA.” (A4)
In general, our results suggest that the administrators’ level
of expertise is rather diverse, much like that of end user
participants. While some had sparse and incomplete mental
models of encryption or HTTPS in particular (e.g., A09, A10,
(cid:19)(cid:22)(cid:21)

A11), some were conﬁdent and able to articulate how HTTPS
works in a very detailed and accurate way.
7) Mental Model Evolution: Figure 8 in the Appendix
shows the mental model reﬁnement over time across the three
drawing tasks. The reﬁnement between the ﬁrst and second
drawing task was equally distributed across our participants.
In contrast, 26 participants had a constant level of detail of
their mental models across drawing tasks 2 and 3.
8) Terminology and Visualization Components: While most
administrators used technical terminology to elicit their mental
models, end users sometimes created new terminology to com-
pensate for missing technical terms in their vocabulary. The
most frequently used technical term by the administrators was
cipher followed by session key and hash. Twelve participants
did not include a visualization of the encrypted message in
their drawings. Five participants represented the encrypted
message as scrambled text or numbers, four used a lock icon,
three drew physical objects like an envelope or a treasure chest,
and three marked the encrypted message with a different color.
Others used scribbled lines, a different language, or chopped
text.
For the ﬁrst drawing task, 20 participants used an abstract
example scenario. The remainder used an arbitrary messaging
app or referred to apps and tools they knew from their
everyday lives (Signal, WhatsApp, PGP/GPG).
Twenty-one participants clearly understood the connection
between drawing tasks 2 (visiting an online shop) and 3
(visiting a bank’s website).
Our results also suggest that only three participants were
aware of the existence and associated risks of (unencrypted)
metadata.
Regarding mental models of HTTPS, we classiﬁed 12
models as clearly conceptual, seven as protocol-based, and
two with both conceptual and protocol-speciﬁc components.
The remaining nine models were too sparse to classify them.
Ten participants explicitly admitted their knowledge gaps and
eight participants tried to cover them.
