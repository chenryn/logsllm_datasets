because Noise-SDR behaves like an SDR. Instead, adding FEC and
interleaving to previous work at transmission and reception would
add significant development efforts and advanced knowledge in
radio communications and signal processing. The advantage of FEC
and interleaving (larger distance at the price of lower effective rate)
is particularly evident in Table IV when comparing the same mode
with and without them (e.g., IV.6 vs. IV.5, IV.13 vs. IV.12, IV.16 vs.

Using IFK+ for resilience to multi-path: The Offset Incremen-
tal Frequency Shift Keying used by THOR [62] is robust because
symbols are encoded in the frequency difference with the previous
symbol instead of a fixed value. In addition, incremental keying
makes it particularly robust to Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) due
to multi-path reception [89], typical of realistic indoor environments
with walls and obstacles. Results are shown in Table IV.9-IV.11.
Using OFDM for higher data rates: Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing consists in modulating multiple orthogonal
subcarriers to increase the data rate. Usually, each carrier is modu-
lated in phase or Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) (phase
and amplitude). Previous work has shown elementary examples of
transmission with multiple OOK-modulated magnetic-field carriers
using multiple CPU cores [11]. Using multiple threads and cores is
necessary because a single thread cannot generate a signal more com-
plex than a single OOK or FSK carrier using previously known tech-
niques, while an OFDM signal with multiple subcarriers shows both
amplitude and frequency variations at multiple levels. Instead, Noise-
SDR can generate a generic signal, including PSK-OFDM, using a
single thread and performant existing protocols. They can achieve
high data rates, as shown in Table IV (IV.14-IV.17). Multiple cores
and threads can be used to further transmit more data at other fre-
quencies, with the same or different protocols. For example, a smart-
phone could run one instance of Fldigi-Noise-SDR transmitting with
3X PSK250R on one core, and another instance transmitting with
PSK31 on another core. See Figure 8a for an example of multiple
PSK subcarriers with a single thread, and Figure 8c for independent
processes transmitting with three different protocols concurrently.
Using Reed Solomon Identifier (RSID) for automatic detec-
tion and tuning: An attacker might not know the exact protocol
and frequency at which the victim device is transmitting. They
could change over time depending on the load, or the same device
could transmit at multiple frequencies with different protocols.
Small differences between devices could lead to slightly different
frequency offsets from the nominal value. For this reason, it is very
useful to prepend an easy-to-detect unique signal before starting the
transmission. To this purpose, Fldigi-Noise-SDR can use RSIDs [90].
These sequences can be easily decoded at very low SNR (âˆ’16 dB)
and uniquely identify the protocols, parameters, and frequency of the
transmission (with a precision of 2.7 Hz). The Fldigi receiver is able
to scan for one or more of the supported protocols over a frequency
band, and automatically start demodulating and decoding once a
transmission is detected. For most protocols, the RSID is easier to
decode than the data. From a security perspective, this is useful to de-
tect at least the presence of a transmitter even when the signal is not
good enough to decode the data. Note that attackers interested in be-
ing more stealth could use custom codes. Nevertheless, the presence
