### 5.3 Impact on Network Performance

The propagation of the number of message deliveries is slower than usual, and messages remain in the network for a longer period, leading to an increase in packet transmission by approximately 25%. Clearly, the continuous application of these techniques can degrade network performance, as some of the strengths of RWG (Routing with Gossip) are lost. This is why these techniques are not integrated into the protocol specification. Instead, it is more effective to apply them only during a specific interval (Im) after detecting an attack. Further studies should determine the optimal intervals for Im in different network environments.

### 5.4 Evaluation Metrics

Given the chaotic nature of the scenario, traditional metrics such as Detection Rate (DR) and False Positive Rate (FPR) are not suitable for evaluation. The success of the approach cannot be measured using these metrics, either on a per-node basis or across the entire network. Factors such as the locality of attackers, the nature of partitions, and node mobility all affect the results, making homogeneous outcomes difficult to achieve. However, we will revisit these metrics and analyze the locality aspects in Section 5.6. Our primary evaluation metrics for detection and mitigation are:

- **K-Delivery Rate (KDR)**: This metric evaluates the proportion of messages that are k-delivered, depending on the network's connectivity, message load, and dynamics. It is a good indicator of the impact of an attack and the effectiveness of its mitigation.
  
- **Packet Transmission Rate (PTR)**: This metric measures the number of packets transmitted during the study interval. It not only indicates bandwidth usage but also reflects the energy consumption of nodes, as more transmissions lead to higher energy use.

### 5.5 Detection and Mitigation Results

The detection approach proposed in Section 4 was tested against the two attacks and their combinations described in Section 5.2 (continuous and transient). When an attack is detected, both mitigations are enabled simultaneously: ignoring ACK packets with possible bogus IDs and not updating the informed vector on received ACK packets. The Im interval was set to 200 seconds.

**Continuous Draining Attack:**
- **Without Detection and Mitigation:** The PTR in the network increases by about 90% above the normal rate due to the attack (excluding the initial peak).
- **With Detection and Mitigation:** The PTR initially increases, but once the attack is detected in most nodes, the mitigation actions reduce the attack's impact. The detection delay observed is about 10-30 seconds after the attack begins for nodes close to the attackers.

**Transient Draining Attack:**
- **Without Detection and Mitigation:** The PTR increases similarly to the continuous case.
- **With Detection and Mitigation:** An initial peak in PTR is noticeable, even in the absence of an attack. After the attack, the number of packets sent gradually returns to normal as the mitigation is disabled within the Im interval. The detection delay is about 10-30 seconds for nodes close to the attackers.

**Continuous Grey Hole Attack:**
- **Without Detection and Mitigation:** The KDR drops to around 10% of the normal rate.
- **With Detection and Mitigation:** The KDR also drops but not as severely, and it stabilizes at values slightly below the normal rate after a certain period.

**Transient Grey Hole Attack:**
- **Without Detection and Mitigation:** The KDR drastically decreases.
- **With Detection and Mitigation:** The mechanism helps in a faster recovery once the attack ends. The detection delay is longer and varies between 10-60 seconds for nodes close to the attackers. This attack is particularly challenging to mitigate because the informed vector can have a contagious impact on other partitions if the mitigation is not enabled everywhere.

These results demonstrate that the approach effectively creates resistance to attacks that conform to the given threat model, despite the complexities introduced by IC-MANETs.

### 5.6 Locality and Classic Metrics

The most common metrics for evaluating anomaly detection performance are Detection Rate (DR) and False Positive Rate (FPR). In this section, we explain why these metrics are less meaningful in IC-MANETs.

- **Detection Rate (DR):** DR = TP / (TP + FN), where TP stands for true positives and FN for false negatives.
- **False Positive Rate (FPR):** FPR = FP / (FP + TN), where TN stands for true negatives.

In intermittently connected networks, the concept of being under attack for a particular node is not clear. Fixed attack intervals for all nodes are meaningless, as attacks do not always occur in well-defined time intervals and confined spaces. Nodes may be isolated from attackers during some periods or too far away to be significantly affected. Additionally, some attacks can propagate even after the source stops attacking, such as certain types of flooding attacks. Therefore, the classic DR and FPR metrics are less applicable in this context.
