I have developed an application that, until a few days ago, was functioning well on both Google App Engine (GAE) and my test server. The app connects to a remote site, logs in, navigates through pages, and inputs information automatically. The remote site uses dynamic URLs to track the session, with each page providing the link for the next request.

The program's workflow is straightforward: it uses `urllib2.urlopen` to make requests, applies regular expressions to extract the next URL, and then makes another call to `urllib2.urlopen`, and so on.

Recently, the application continues to work perfectly on the test server but fails when deployed on GAE. Specifically, after a series of calls to `urllib2.urlopen`, the remote site frequently reports that the session has been lost, often as early as the second call. Occasionally, I can proceed to the third call, and in one instance, GAE successfully reached the fourth call. This behavior suggests that the issue is not related to security measures on the remote site (which have not changed) or to redirects and cookies, as mentioned in other posts.

Users have reported that the application worked correctly up until September 14, 2013, and the first failure was reported on September 20, 2013. Has there been any recent change in the handling of URLfetch in GAE?

After spending two days troubleshooting, I have not found a clear solution. One possible explanation could be related to IP addresses. The remote server might be controlling the session using a combination of the IP address and dynamic URLs. Since GAE does not guarantee that all calls to `urllib2` within the same request are handled by the same machine, this could explain why the application sometimes works for two or three successive URLs.

Could you confirm if there have been any changes in the URLfetch handling in GAE recently? Additionally, is it correct that GAE does not ensure that all `urlfetch` calls will originate from the same IP address?

Thank you in advance for your insights.
