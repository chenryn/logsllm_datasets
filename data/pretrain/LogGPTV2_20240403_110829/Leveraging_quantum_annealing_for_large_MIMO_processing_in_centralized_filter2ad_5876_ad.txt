nealer’s control plane and its quantum substrate, machine parame-
ters, and their tuning to the problem at hand.

Each anneal cycle on the DW2Q yields a configuration of spins
(i.e., one decoded bit string). The user programs the annealer to
run a batch of Na annealing cycles (one QA run) with the same
parameters to accumulate statistics, which means that we have a
set of Na configurations from a DW2Q job submission. The lowest
energy configuration among Na anneals is the best answer found.

problem employing just 80 physical qubits (e.g. 16-user BPSK, 8-
user QPSK, and 4-user 16-QAM) could in fact be run more than 20
times in parallel on the DW2Q.
Precision Issues. As analog devices, the desired embedded Ising
coefficients (Eqs. 10-12 in Appendix B) do not perfectly match their
real energy values once hardcoded in the real machine, and hence
give rise to intrinsic control errors (ICE), an uncontrollable shift
in the actual programmed values of the objective function. ICE is
appropriately modeled as a noise fluctuating at a time scale of the
order of the anneal time, i.e., on each anneal, Ising coefficients are
perturbed: fi −→ fi + ⟨δfi⟩, gij −→ gij + ⟨δgij⟩. where the noise is
Gaussian with mean and variance measured ⟨δfi⟩ ≃ 0.008±0.02 and
⟨δgij⟩ ≃ −0.015 ± 0.025 in the most delicate phase of the annealing
run [16]. The impact of ICE on performance depends on the problem
at hand [12, 78], but it is clear that precision issues will arise if the
largest energy scale squeezes the value of the coefficients (in Eqs. 11–
12 in Appendix B) to a level where ICE is likely to erase significant
information of the problem’s ground state configuration.
Annealer Parameter Setting. As discussed in Section 3.3, the
|JF | that enforces a chain of qubits to return a series of values
which are all in agreement (either all +1 or −1), and the annealing
time Ta are both key performance parameters that determine the
net time to find a solution, and hence overall QA performance. We
also introduce 1, 10, and 100 µs pause time Tp in the middle of
annealing (Ta = 1 µs) with various pause positions sp, to see the
effect of pausing [43] on our problems. Setting |JF | too large would
wash out the problem information due to ICE, however |JF | on
average should increase with the number of logical chains in fully-
connected problems in the absence of ICE [69]. Due to the lack of a
first-principles predictive theory on the correct value for a given

instance, we present in Section 5.3 an empirical investigation of the
best embedding parameters, employing the microbenchmarking
methodologies generally accepted [52, 57, 69]. Below we perform
a sensitivity analysis on JF , Ta, Tp, and sp (§5.3.1) over the ranges
JF ∈ {1.0 − 10.0 (0.5)} , Ta ∈ {1, 10, 100 µs}, Tp ∈ {1, 10, 100 µs},
and sp ∈ {0.15 − 0.55 (0.02)}.
Improved coupling dynamic range. The dynamic range of cou-
pler strengths is defined as the ratio between the maximum and
minimum values that can be set (дij in Eq. 2). To strengthen inter-
actions between embedded qubits, the DW2Q is able to double the
magnitude of valid negative coupler values, effectively increasing
the precision of embedded problems and reducing ICE. However,
this improved range option, when enabled, breaks the symmetry
of the Ising objective function (substituting the opposite signs for
connected coefficients and their couplings, into the same problem),
and hence precludes averaging over these symmetrical instances
as the DW2Q does without the improved range option, to mitigate
leakage errors [4]. It is thus unclear whether the use of this fea-
ture is beneficial in the end without experimentation, and so we
benchmark in Section 5 both with and without improved range.
5 EVALUATION
We evaluate QuAMax on the DW2Q Quantum Annealer machine
shown in Figure 1. We consider the same number of antennas at
the clients and AP (i.e., Nt = Nr ). Section 5.1 introduces QA results,
while Section 5.2 explains our experimental methodology. After
that in Section 5.3 we present results under only the presence of
the annealer’s internal thermal noise (ICE). Sections 5.4 and 5.5 add
wireless AWGN channel noise and trace-based real-world wireless
channels, respectively, quantifying their interactions with ICE on
end-to-end performance. Over 8 × 1010 anneals are used in our
performance evaluation.
5.1 Understanding Empirical QA Results
We begin with a close look at two runs of the QA machine, to clarify
the relationships between Ising energy, Ising energy-ranked solu-
tion order, and BER. Figure 4 shows six QA problem instances (all
of which require 36 logical qubits), corresponding to two different
wireless channel uses for each of varying modulation and number
of users. The solutions are sorted (ranked) by their relative Ising
energy difference ∆E from the minimum Ising energy (blue numbers

atop selected solutions), where red bars show each solution’s fre-
quency of occurrence (in the rare case of two or more tied distinct
solutions, we split those solutions into multiple solution ranks).
The number of bit errors associated with each solution appears as a
green curve. For statistical significance, this data summarizes 50,000
anneals, more than QuAMax’s practical operation. As modulation
order increases and number of users decreases (from left to right
in Figure 4), the probability of finding the ground state tends to
be lower, while the search space size remains constant, leading
eventually to higher BER and FER.5 The relative Ising energy gap
also trends smaller,6 and is likely to be inversely correlated with
the impact of ICE on the problem instance [2, 78].
5.2 Experimental methodology
In this section, we introduce performance metrics and figures of
merit that give insight into the operation of the QA machine as it
solves the ML MIMO decoding problem.
We note that in our performance evaluation we exclude from
consideration programming time and post-programming time of
the Ising coefficients on the chip, and readout latency of the qubit
states after a single anneal. Currently, these times dominate the
pure computation time (i.e. total anneal time) by several orders of
magnitude (milliseconds), due to engineering limitations of the tech-
nology. However, these overheads do not scale with problem size
and are not fundamental performance factors of the fully integrated
QuAMax system, and so this is in accordance with experimental
QA literature convention. We discuss these overheads in Section 7.
5.2.1 Metric: Time-to-Solution (TTS). Suppose we find the ground
state (corresponding to the minimum energy solution within the
search space of 2N bit strings, where N is the variable count)
with probability P0. In the absence (but not presence) of chan-
nel noise, this ground state corresponds to a correct decoding. Each
anneal is an independent, identically-distributed random process,
meaning that the expected time to solution, or TT S(P), is the an-
neal time of each anneal Ta multiplied by the expected number
of samples to be able to find the ML solution with probability P:
TT S(P) = Ta · log(1 − P)/log(1 − P0). TTS is commonly used in
the QA literature, setting P = 0.99 [58].
5.2.2 Our Metrics: BER and Time-to-BER (TTB). TTS reflects the
expected time to find the ground state, but does not characterize the
expected time our system takes to achieve a certain Bit Error Rate
(BER, averaged across users), the figure of merit at the physical layer.
This quantity differs from TTS, because TTS only considers the
ground state, and as illustrated in the example shown in Figure 4,
solutions with energy greater than the ground state may also have
(rarely) no or relatively few bit errors, while wireless channel noise
may induce bit errors in the ground state solution itself. Hence we
introduce a metric to characterize the time required to obtain a
certain BER p, Time-to-BER: TTB(p). This is preferred in our setting,
since a low but non-zero bit error rate is acceptable (error control
coding operates above MIMO detection).
5See section 5.2.2. Frame error rate FER is computed as 1 − (1 − BER)frame size.
6The energy distribution of the Ising objective function (Eq. 2) corresponds to the
distribution of ML decoder Euclidean distances (Eq. 1).

TTB for a single channel use. Since one QA run includes multi-
ple (Na) anneals, we return the annealing solution with minimum
energy among all anneals in that run. We show an example of this
process for one instance (i.e., channel use, comprised of certain trans-
mitted bits and a certain wireless channel) in Fig. 4. The annealer
finds different solutions, with different Ising energies, ranking them
in order of their energy. Considering this order statistic, and the
fact that QuAMax considers only the best solution found by all the
anneals in a run, the expected BER of instance I after Na anneals
can be expressed as

of bit errors of the k
TTB(p), we replace the left hand side of Eq. 9 with p, solve for Na,
and compute TTB(p) = NaTa/Pf .
Generalizing to multiple channel uses. The preceding predicts
TTB for a fixed instance. In the following study we compute TTB
and BER across multiple instances (random transmitted bits and
randomly-selected wireless channel), reporting statistics on the
resulting sampled distributions.
5.3 Performance Under Annealer Noise
This section presents results from the DW2Q annealer for wireless
channel noise-free scenarios, in order to characterize the machine’s
performance itself as a function of time spent computing. Sec-
tions 5.4 and 5.5 experiment with Gaussian noise and trace-based
wireless channels, respectively.
In this section, we run several instances with unit fixed chan-
nel gain and average transmitted power. Each instance has a ran-
dom-phase channel, randomly chosen transmitted bit string, and
is repeated for each of three different modulations (BPSK, QPSK,
16-QAM) and varying numbers of users and AP antennas. Each
instance is reduced to Ising as described in Section 3.2, for a total
of 780 different problems per QA parameter setting. Unless other-
wise specified, this and subsequent sections use the fixed parameter
settings defined in §5.3.1. We obtain significant statistics by post-
processing up to 50,000 anneals per QA run (except 10,000 anneals
for anneal pause analysis in Figure 7).
5.3.1 Choosing Annealer Parameters. In order to isolate the ef-
fect of different parameter settings on individual problems, we
employ microbenchmarks on TTS. This section explains our choice
of parameter settings for our main performance results in §5.3.3,
§5.4, and §5.5. Note that while we plot results here only for BPSK
and QPSK to save space, our results show that the methods, argu-
ments and observations generalize to higher modulations, unless
otherwise indicated. For the purpose of setting the parameters, we
restrict the dataset to the ML problems that solve within a median
TTS(0.99) of 10 ms for which we have low uncertainty on the mea-
sured success probability. We use the determined parameters for
all instances regardless of their TTS for the performance analysis.
7Note that the metric has omniscient knowledge of ground truth transmitted bits,
while the machine does not.

Ferromagnetic couplings: We examine median TTS(0.99) versus
|JF | over 10 random instances of different sizes both with and with-
out extended dynamic range. In Fig. 5, we observe that while there is
a performance optimum that depends on the problem size for stan-
dard dynamic range, extended dynamic range shows less sensitivity
to |JF |, obtaining roughly the optimal |JF | performance of standard
dynamic range. Anneal time: As we vary Ta, we observe greater
sensitivity when we use non-optimal JF , as the scatter points next
to each data point in Fig. 6 (left) show. On the other hand, Fig. 6
(right) shows that an extended dynamic range setting achieves best
results at Ta = 1 µs regardless of problem size, showing less sensi-
tivity to different |JF |. Anneal Pause Time and Location: When
we apply improved dynamic range at Ta = 1 µs, we observe a slight
independence (Fig. 7) of sp and Jf on Tp, and as Tp increases, so
does TTS. While the dynamic range setting has shown less sensitiv-
ity to |JF |, anneal pause with extended dynamic range shows more
sensitivity. Note that TTS of 18-user QPSK at Tp = 1 µs is slightly
improved, compared to the best results in Figs. 5 and 6.
Annealer Parameter Optimization. Based on the previous sen-
sitivity analysis, we select a default QA parameter setting. First, we
choose improved dynamic range since it is relatively robust to

of anneals (upper) and time (lower) for 18 × 18 QPSK (median across 20
instances). Error bars indicate 15th. and 85th. percentiles.
choice of |JF |, nearly equaling the best performance of the standard
dynamic range. Second, we choose Tp = 1 µs, since it shows better
results and greater pause times dominate the anneal time.
5.3.2 Choosing whether to pause. With the above default QA
parameters, we now use TTB to explore whether or not we should
use the QA pause functionality, as TTB encompasses both algo-
rithms’ BER performance as well as wall clock running time (cf.
TTS). We first define a fixed parameter setting by selecting the best
estimated choices for the non-pausing algorithm and for the paus-
ing algorithm, meaning the parameters which optimize medians
across a sample of instances belonging to the same problem class
(e.g. 18×18 QPSK). This approach is to be compared against an or-
acle that optimizes {JF , Ta} or {JF , sp} instance by instance. In the
figures, we denote the two parameter setting methods as Fix (fixed)
and Opt (optimal), respectively.
Our motivation for considering Opt is that it provides a bound to
what can be achieved by the methods that seek to optimize machine
parameter settings instance by instance [68, 70], currently under
investigation. With our traces we compute BER as a function of Na
