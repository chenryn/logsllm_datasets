### Proof of Corollary 1

In this section, we prove the simplified bound (stated in (6)) on the Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) of the shuffle model, provided that \(\lambda\), \(\epsilon_0\), and \(n\) satisfy a certain condition. Specifically, we will show that if \(\lambda\), \(\epsilon_0\), and \(n\) satisfy \(\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0} < \frac{n}{9}\), then:

\[
\epsilon(\lambda) \leq \frac{1}{\lambda - 1} \log \left( 1 + \lambda^2 (e^{\epsilon_0} - 1)^2 \right)
\]

To show this, it suffices to prove the following inequality:

\[
\sum_{i=3}^{\lambda} \left( \frac{\lambda (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)}{(2e^{2\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} \right)^i \frac{(e^{\epsilon_0} - 1)^2}{\lambda - 1} \leq \frac{n e^{\epsilon_0}}{2}
\]

First, note that there are \((\lambda - 2)\) terms inside the summation. If we show that each of these terms is smaller than 1, then the summation is at most \((\lambda - 2)\) times the term with \(i = 3\). Further, if the additional exponential term in the LHS is upper-bounded by the term with \(i = 3\), then we can prove the inequality by showing that \((\lambda - 1)\) times the term with \(i = 3\) is upper-bounded by the RHS. These arguments are summarized in the following set of three inequalities:

1. \(\frac{\lambda (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)}{(2e^{2\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} < 1\)
2. \(e^{\epsilon_0 \lambda - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}}} \leq \left( \frac{\lambda (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)}{(2e^{2\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} \right)^3\)
3. \((\lambda - 1) \left( \frac{\lambda (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)}{(2e^{2\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} \right)^3 \leq \frac{n e^{\epsilon_0}}{2}\)

In the rest of this proof, we will derive the condition on \(\epsilon_0\), \(\lambda\), and \(n\) such that the third inequality is satisfied. As we will see later, the values of \(\epsilon_0\) and \(\lambda\) thus obtained will automatically satisfy the first and second inequalities.

By canceling same terms from both sides of the third inequality, we get:

\[
\lambda^2 (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)^3 \leq (e^{\epsilon_0} - 1)^2 (2e^{\epsilon_0} n)^{3/2} e^{3\epsilon_0/2}
\]

For the LHS and the RHS, we respectively have:

\[
(e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)(e^{\epsilon_0} + 1)^2 \leq 3e^{4\epsilon_0}
\]

Therefore, in order to show the inequality, it suffices to show \(3\lambda^2 e^{4\epsilon_0} \leq (2e^{\epsilon_0} n)^{3/2} e^{3\epsilon_0/2}\), which is equivalent to \(\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0} < \frac{n}{9}\). Thus, we have shown that \(\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0} < \frac{n}{9}\) implies the third inequality.

Now we show that when \(\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0} < \frac{n}{9}\), the first and second inequalities are automatically satisfied:

1. **Proof of the first inequality:**

\[
\frac{\lambda (e^{2\epsilon_0} - 1)}{(2e^{2\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} \leq \frac{\lambda e^{2\epsilon_0}}{(2e^{\epsilon_0} n)^{1/2}} \leq \frac{\lambda^2 e^{3\epsilon_0}}{2e^{\epsilon_0} n} \leq \frac{\sqrt{\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0}}}{\sqrt{2e^{\epsilon_0} n}} < 1
\]

2. **Proof of the second inequality:**

For the upper-bound on \(e^{\epsilon_0 \lambda - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}}}\), we have:

\[
\epsilon_0 \lambda - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}} \leq \frac{\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0}}{4} - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}}
\]

Using the fact that \(\epsilon_0 \lambda \leq \frac{e^{5\epsilon_0/4} \lambda^4}{4}\), we get:

\[
\epsilon_0 \lambda - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}} \leq \frac{\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0}}{4} - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}}
\]

Substituting these bounds, we get:

\[
\epsilon_0 \lambda - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}} \leq \frac{\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0}}{4} - \frac{n-1}{8e^{\epsilon_0}}
\]

Thus, we have shown that \(\lambda^4 e^{5\epsilon_0} < \frac{n}{9}\) implies all three inequalities, completing the proof.
