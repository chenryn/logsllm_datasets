### Impact on Phone Battery Life and Performance Overhead

The introduction of additional cryptographic functions, such as those used in TLS-OBC and the login ticket issuance, signature, and verification, can have an impact on phone battery life. Additionally, the overhead introduced during the login process, including communication with the phone and additional round trips between the browser and server, can also affect performance. Below, we discuss several of these issues.

#### Cryptographic Overhead

A key concern is the use of TLS-OBC, as every connection to the login service will incur a certain performance penalty. If the latency and overhead introduced by TLS-OBC are too significant, this will result in slower load times for the login page. For a detailed discussion of TLS-OBC performance, we refer the reader to [13]. This study shows that the overhead is negligible once the browser has generated a client certificate (and very small for certain key types even when a new client certificate needs to be generated).

The cryptographic overhead during the login process, which includes generating, checking, and signing the login ticket, is relatively minor compared to the "human-scale" operations performed during login, such as typing a username and password. Additionally, the overhead is minimal compared to the additional round trips between the browser and server. In our test setup, which included 1000 runs, the typical time for login ticket generation and verification was about 1 millisecond. We also examined the timing of other cryptographic operations, but they incurred delays of approximately the same order of magnitude, so we do not report them separately.
