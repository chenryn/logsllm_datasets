service on the phone battery life, to overhead introduced by the
additional cryptographic functions (both for TLS-OBC and for the
login ticket issuance, signature and veriﬁcation), and ﬁnally the
additional overhead introduced during login by communicating to
the phone, additional round trips between browser and server, and
so on. Below we discuss a number of these issues.
OVERHEAD OF CRYPTOGRAPHY. A key concern is the use of
TLS-OBC – since every connection to the login service will incur
the respective penalty.
If the latency and overhead introduced
by TLS-OBC is too great, then this will manifest itself in slow
load times of the login page, for example. We refer the reader
to a detailed discussion of the TLS-OBC performance [13]. That
work shows that the overhead is negligible once the browser has
generated a client certiﬁcate (and very small for certain key types
even when a new client certiﬁcate needs to be generated).
The overhead of cryptography during the login process (gen-
erating the login ticket, checking and signing it, and checking
the ticket signature) is dwarfed by the “human-scale” operations
performed during login (typing a username and password), and
by the additional round trips between browser and server. For
example, a typical login ticket generation and veriﬁcation took
about 1 millisecond in our setup of 1000 test runs. We examined
the timing of other cryptographic operations, but do not report on
them as they incur a delay of approximately the same order, but
