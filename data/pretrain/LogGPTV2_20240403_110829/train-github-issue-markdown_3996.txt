Currently, JavaConfig integrates with the TestContext framework via its
`ContextLoader` implementation, `JavaConfigContextLoader`:
    @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)
    @ContextConfiguration(locations="com.bank.TransferAppConfig",
                          loader=JavaConfigContextLoader.class)
    public class TransferServiceTests {
        // @Test methods ...
    }
This integration works well enough but is not refactoring-friendly due to the
requirement that `@ContextConfiguration` imposes that locations must be a
`String[]`. It forces the fully-qualified class name to be expressed as a
string, when it would clearly be superior to be able to pass it around by
`Class` literal.
Implementing this change would require a change to core, either by adding an
attribute to `@ContextConfiguration` that takes a `Class[]` (not likely), or
otherwise devising a way of proving a customized annotation (e.g.,
`@JavaConfigContextConfiguration`).
