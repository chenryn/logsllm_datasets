As mentioned in Section 2, a prefix in the blackspace has no inetnum entry in the IRR and has not been allocated for use by a RIR. Figure 2 breaks down the statuses attributed to these IP addresses. Excluding route leaks, most of the blackspace is due to reserved resources, which are set aside by RIRs because they cannot be allocated immediately.

Figure 3 plots the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the number of consecutive days a single prefix was included in the blackspace. The solid line represents all blackspace prefixes, including those from transient route leaks observed in Figure 1. The dashed line excludes these leak-related prefixes. The difference between these two curves indicates that many distinct prefixes were added to the blackspace due to route leaks. The solid CDF shows that most blackspace prefixes are detected for four or five consecutive days, corresponding to the duration of the leaks. The dashed CDF shows that 50% of non-leak blackspace prefixes are seen for at least 12 days, and around 28% are seen for one day or less.

#### Daily Variation of Blackspace

| Jaccard Index | 1.0 | 0.8 | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0.2 | 0.0 |  |

To understand the daily variation in the blackspace, Figure 4 plots the Jaccard index between two successive days. The Jaccard index is computed as the ratio of the number of blackspace prefixes detected on both days, divided by the total number of distinct blackspace prefixes detected on either day. A value of 1 indicates identical blackspaces, while a value of 0 indicates completely different blackspaces. The full line shows high variation during the start and end of route leaks, but otherwise, the variation is minimal (as shown by the dashed curve).

#### Post-Blackspace Situation

| Status | Withdrawn | Inetnum | Assigned |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Percentage | 45% |  | 55% |

The duration of a prefix in the blackspace (Figure 3) and the variation of the blackspace (Figure 4) imply that some prefixes leave the blackspace. This can happen if:
1. The prefix is withdrawn from BGP.
2. An inetnum entry is added in the IRR.
3. The prefix is marked as allocated or assigned by a RIR.

Figure 5 plots the distribution of each event for prefixes that exited the blackspace during our observation period. For all entries and those not resulting from route leaks, the most likely cause is that the prefix was withdrawn. The second cause is the creation of an inetnum entry in an IRR database. If the IRR entry is more specific than the blackspace prefix, another more specific prefix will be included in the blackspace instead. Consequently, about 45% of prefixes leave the blackspace because the BGP announcement was withdrawn. The other 55% become allocated or assigned, implying that half of the prefixes in the blackspace are potentially used in good faith by the announcers. However, the other half, which globally amounts to a /11 network, does not end up as a registered network.

### 3.2 BGP Characterization

In the previous section, we observed that there are many blackspace prefixes, many of which are long-lasting. In this section, we focus on the BGP characteristics of blackspace prefixes. We first examine the origin AS of the blackspace prefixes to shed light on their uses. Where we cannot, we look at the temporal evolution of the blackspace prefix along with its origin AS to better understand the root cause.

AS numbers are assigned a status by RIRs, similar to IP blocks (see Section 2): allocated, assigned, available, or reserved. Figure 6 plots the daily proportion of each AS status for ASes that originate a blackspace prefix. The plot further classifies private AS numbers (between 64,512 and 65,535) separately from the reserved set. As shown by the black/squared line, private ASNs are responsible for a large number of prefixes, but only during the two route leaks. All leaked prefixes are originated from a private ASN. Allocated, assigned, and reserved ASNs roughly account for a third of blackspace prefixes, while available ASNs account for less than 10%. Reserved and available ASNs should not be in use, yet two-thirds of the blackspace prefixes are originated by these ASes.

**Figure 6.** Daily status of the ASNs originating a blackspace prefix.

| Proportion (%) | 100 | 80 | 60 | 40 | 20 | 0 |  |

**Figure 7.** Percentage of blackspace prefixes for ASes that announce at least one blackspace prefix, further subdivided by AS status, excluding private AS numbers.

- **Allocated**
- **Assigned**
- **Available**
- **Reserved**

| Percentage of Blackspace Prefixes | 0 | 20 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 100 |
|-----------------------------------|---|----|----|----|----|----|
| CDF Value | 0.2 | 0.4 | 0.6 | 0.8 | 1.0 |  |

Both allocated and assigned statuses behave similarly, with more than 90% announcing less than 1% of blackspace prefixes. Less than 10% of allocated and around 20% of assigned ASes originate more than a quarter of blackspace prefixes. On the other hand, close to 70% of reserved and available ASes only announce blackspace prefixes. The average number of announced prefixes by allocated ASes is 229, by assigned ASes is 340, by reserved ASes is four, and by available ASes is two.

To identify the operators of these networks, we looked at the names of the corporations behind these ASes using [9]. We resolved 185 network names for allocated or assigned ASes that originate blackspace prefixes, locating the corporation websites using popular web search engines. We resolved 178 names, mostly to telephone or cable companies and ISPs (of all sizes and shapes: tier-1 to tier-3, from dial-up to business-grade fiber providers, all around the world), hosting and cloud providers, data centers, IT service companies, and worldwide tech companies. Other companies operated in advertising, airlines, banks and insurances, construction, courier and parcel delivery services, e-commerce, Internet exchange points, law firms, medical companies, military contractors, and online news. We could not resolve seven names. One was established as a company, but the website did not work, one used a name too generic to be found, and for three, we could not locate any further information. The two remaining ASes appear to have been registered by individuals in Eastern Europe who also own other ASNs known to send spam but do not originate blackspace prefixes simultaneously.
