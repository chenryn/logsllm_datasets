User: How to configure automatic backup and disaster recovery on AWS?
Assistant: The steps to configure automatic backup and disaster recovery on AWS are as follows: 1. Use Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) to create a database instance. Select the type of database engine suitable for the business, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. 2. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to save the database backup file. Set appropriate access permissions for the bucket. 3. Configure automatic backups. In the RDS console, select the database instance and enter the "Backup" tab. Enable automatic backups and choose a backup retention period of up to 35 days. At the same time, store the backup file into the S3 bucket. 4. Configure disaster recovery. In the RDS console, select the "Multi-AZ" tab to enable multi-AZ deployment. In this way, each availability zone will have a database copy, and if one availability zone fails, it will automatically switch to another availability zone to achieve fast disaster recovery. 5. Conduct periodic testing. Regularly test backup viability and recovery times to ensure rapid recovery of data in the event of a disaster.
