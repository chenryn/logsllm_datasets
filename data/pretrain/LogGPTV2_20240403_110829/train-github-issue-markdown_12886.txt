Next5 causes some subtle breakage when developing in code that worked
correctly in Next4, for a site that uses express. In particular, two things
are observed in dev mode:
  1. There is a flash of unstyled site before all `` CSS loads on first load. (Client side navs are still fine.)
  2. 401s on HMR, when using express-basic-auth.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
I created a minimal folder structure to demo the second behaviour:

  1. Unzip, run yarn install, yarn dev (this uses Next 4.2.3.)
  2. Visit localhost:3000, enter "something", "secure"
  3. Open console.
  4. Edit index.js
  5. In the Network tab, observe that `on-demand-entries-ping?page=/` returns a 200.
  6. Stop the server
  7. yarn add next@latest, yarn dev.
  8. Visit localhost:3000, enter "something", "secure" (new incognito window if you like)
  9. Edit index.js
  10. In the Network tab, observe that `on-demand-entries-ping?page=/` returns a 401.
