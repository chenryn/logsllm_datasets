### New Vulnerability: Exposure Function

#### Introduction to the Exposure Function
The exposure function in 4G and 5G networks provides a new attack surface, allowing third-party applications and services to interact with the core network via REST APIs.

#### Architecture
- **Core Network**: 4G/5G Core
- **Exposure Function**: Interfaces with the core network and external entities
- **Network Partners**: MVNOs, MNOs, IoT service providers, platform providers
- **Vertical Industries**: Various sectors that leverage mobile connectivity
- **Third-Party Application Developers**: Developers creating applications that use network data and services

#### Key Components
- **REST APIs**: For interaction between the exposure function and external applications
- **Northbound APIs**: For communication between the exposure function and the core network
- **Service APIs**: For specific functionalities such as device management, location tracking, and billing

### Control IoT with 4G and 5G Networks
- **API Server (Provider)**: Manages the REST APIs for IoT services
- **IoT Service Platform**: Central hub for managing IoT devices and services
- **Backend**: Supports the platform's operations
- **IoT Connectivity Management Platform**: Manages SIM cards and network access
- **API Portal**: Provides access to service APIs

#### Accessing Network Exposure Services via IoT Service Platforms
1. **IoT SIM Cards**: 
   - Features: IP-data, SMS tariff, 10-year lifetime, roaming free
   - Example: 750MB, 250 SMS, $10
2. **Radio Connectivity**: 4G networks (NB-IoT, LTE-M, 2G)
3. **Subscription Process**:
   - Prove industry/company identity (e.g., using Tax ID)
   - Subscribe to a business plan (including NB-IoT/LTE-M SIM cards)
   - Receive SIM cards and API portal access
   - Activate SIM cards and create API credentials
   - Integrate service APIs into IoT application functions

### Flow Diagram: Obtaining Access to Exposure Services
- **Business Agreement**: Grants access to the IoT connectivity management platform
- **User/SIM Management Web Application**: Manage SIM status, activation, and deactivation

### IoT Service Platform Features
- **Service APIs Portal**: Swagger/OpenAPI interface
- **APIs for IoT Device Management**: 30-100 APIs for connectivity status, tracking, SMS exchange, IP data exchange, etc.
- **Applications**: Smart factory, VR, fleet tracking, vehicle telematics
- **Management Functions**: Billing, data plan management, SIM and credential management, device IP address management, roaming policy control
- **API Access Roles**: API administrator, API user, developer

### API Security for Network Exposure
- **3GPP Standard (Recommended) Fundamental Security Mechanisms**:
  - **Authentication & Authorization**: OAuth 2.0
  - **Confidentiality and Integrity Protection**: TLS
  - **Privacy**
  - **Rate Limiting**
  - **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Guidelines from GSMA**:
  - [IoT Security Guidelines for Network Operators](https://www.gsma.com/iot/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CLP.14-v2.2-GSMA-IoT-Security-Guidelines-for-Network-Operators.pdf)
  - [IoT Security Guidelines for IoT Service Ecosystems](https://www.gsma.com/iot/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CLP.12-v1.0.pdf)

### How It Works: Getting Device Location
1. **Submit Credentials for Authentication**
2. **Receive Access Token for Authorization**
3. **Establish HTTPS (TLS) Security**
4. **API Request**: Device connectivity and location status
5. **API Response**: Device connectivity and location status

#### Example API Interaction
- **API Call**: `/auth` (username, password)
- **Response**: `access_token`, `expires_in`
- **Request**: `GET https://1.2.3.4/api/sim/89**28**66**03**35*/status`
- **Authorization Header**: `Token AYjcyMzY3ZDhiNmJkNTY`
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "location": {
      "country": { "latitude": "*", "longitude": "*", "mcc": "2**", "mnc": "*" },
      "iccid": "89**28**66**03**35*",
      "imsi": "2****63281***77",
      "msisdn": "*81*0*1*9*1*7",
      "organisation_id": "4977",
      "operator_name": "********",
      "sgsn_addr": "4*1.VS*PZ**.epc.mnc*.mcc*.3gpp.org"
    },
    "status": "ONLINE",
    "pdp_context": {
      "ggsn_ip_addr": "10.70.4.17",
      "rat_type": { "description": "NB-IoT" },
      "sgsn_control_plane_ip_addr": "10.73.4.5",
      "ue_ip_address": "100.96.15.132"
    }
  }
  ```

### Commercial IoT Service Platform Features and Configuration
- **Service Platform (SP)**: Type of exposure defined by NGMN
- **Credentials**: Username and password
- **Current Network Exposure**: Using 4G core (SCEF)
- **HSTS**: HTTP Strict-Transport-Security

### Attack Model in Service Platforms
- **Requirements**:
  - Business relationship with the operator or service provider (can forge a tax ID)
  - Authentication credentials for access
  - Access to all service APIs, platform, and connectivity management platform
- **Goals**:
  - Obtain data of arbitrary IoT service platform users (industries)
  - Compromise server and penetrate into the mobile core network via the exposure function
- **Privileges**:
  - Web/API knowledge
  - Internet access
  - Remote location
  - Use of VPN or Tor

### Security Problems with IoT Platforms
- **Standard Security Mechanisms**: Are they sufficient?
- **Business Logic Flaws**: Require manual intensive testing
- **Web/API Firewalls or Security-by-Design**
- **Security Scanners and Automated Testing**
- **Limited Knowledge on Attacks on IoT Service Platforms**

### Our Interests in the Platform
- **Dynamic API Security Analysis** on 9 commercial IoT service platforms
  - **To Find Vulnerabilities** in API configuration, input validation, business flow, authentication, access control, and transport layer security
  - **Select APIs** with high impact on business and reputation
  - **Potential Attacks**: Billing fraud, DoS, code execution, device hijacking, sending SMS or IP messages to arbitrary IoT devices, resetting billing and charging counters, APN manipulation, location tracking, device blacklisting
- **Modeling Attacks**:
  - Inject malicious payloads, strings, characters, files
  - Follow guidelines from OWASP web security testing and REST security cheat sheets
  - Use tools like Burpsuite, ZAP, and other well-known API testing tools

### Ethical Considerations
- **Data Access and Manipulation**: Only manipulate data corresponding to our own user/admin accounts
- **Key API Parameters**: Analyze only critical parameters (IMSI, ICCID, APN, Tariff, topup, MSISDN, SMS) to avoid excessive traffic
- **Operations**: Conduct GET, POST, PUT operations within our own accounts
