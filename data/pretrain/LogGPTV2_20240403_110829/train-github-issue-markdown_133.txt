Forked from #24038 (comment)
We are adding federation scheduler and controller manager as per the plan in
#23653.
There is obviously some common code that is shared with kubernetes controller
manager and kubernetes scheduler.  
We want to pull out that code into libraries to enable code reuse rather than
having to duplicate code.
We need to figure out the right name and directory structure for such
libraries.
