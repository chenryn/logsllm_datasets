Forked from #24038 (comment)

As part of the plan outlined in #23653, we are integrating a federation scheduler and controller manager. There is significant overlap in the codebase between these components and the existing Kubernetes controller manager and scheduler. 

To promote code reuse and avoid duplication, we propose extracting the shared functionality into dedicated libraries. This approach will streamline maintenance and ensure consistency across our projects.

We need to determine the appropriate naming conventions and directory structure for these new libraries. Your input on this matter would be greatly appreciated.
