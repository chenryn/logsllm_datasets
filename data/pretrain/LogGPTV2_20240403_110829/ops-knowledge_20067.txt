To identify security vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in Scala source code, there are a few open-source and commercial tools available. While your online search may have yielded limited results, I would like to highlight an effective solution: Codacy.

Codacy is an automated code review platform that has implemented Scala security patterns. A blog post on their website details the first nine patterns, and you can find additional patterns by filtering for "security" in their documentation. More patterns are expected to be released soon.

Here's how Codacy works:

1. Log in to the platform.
2. Connect it to your Git repository.
3. Codacy will analyze each commit, identifying any newly created or resolved issues related to coding style, performance, complexity, and security, among others.
4. The platform offers an on-premises version for those who prefer it.

Codacy provides users with the flexibility to customize rules and even create their own, ensuring that it can be tailored to your specific needs. Additionally, it is free for open-source projects.
