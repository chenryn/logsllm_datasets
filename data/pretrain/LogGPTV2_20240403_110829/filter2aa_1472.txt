# Hacking Measured Boot and UEFI

**Presenter: Dan Griffin, JW Secure, Inc.**

## Introduction
- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: A firmware interface that replaces the traditional BIOS.
- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module)**: A hardware component that provides secure cryptographic functions.
- **Secure Boot**: A feature in UEFI that ensures only trusted software can boot on a system.
- **Measured Boot**: A process where the TPM measures and records the integrity of the boot process.
- **Remote Attestation**: A method to verify the integrity of a remote device by examining its boot log.

## Hardware Landscape
- **BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)**
- **Capability Standards**:
  - Phones
  - Tablets
  - PCs

## Why UEFI Lockdown?
- **OEM & ISV Revenue Streams**: Protecting proprietary software and revenue.
- **App Store User Experience**: Ensuring a consistent and secure user experience.
- **Defense Against Rootkits & Bad Drivers**: Preventing malicious software from compromising the system.
- **Impact on Linux Community**: Potential restrictions on non-Windows operating systems.

## State of UEFI
- **Not New**: UEFI has been around for several years.
- **Full-Featured**: Can include a network stack.
- **Software Development Kits Available**: Intel TianoCore.
- **Test Hardware Available**: Intel, BeagleBoard.

## UEFI Secure Boot
- **User-Modifiable**: Usually, users can disable or modify it, but this varies by implementation.
- **Windows 8 ARM Exception**: 
  - Purchase a $99 signing certificate from VeriSign.
  - Use a different ARM platform.
  - Use x86 architecture.

## Measured Boot and Remote Attestation
### Measured Boot
- **Process**: The TPM measures and records the integrity of each boot component.
- **Boot Log**: Contains PCR (Platform Configuration Register) data, AIK (Attestation Identity Key) public key, and a signature.

### Remote Attestation
- **Process**: A client device sends a signed boot log to an attestation server for verification.
- **Demo**: Measured Boot Tool (http://mbt.codeplex.com/)
  - **Part 1**: Whatâ€™s in the boot log?
  - **Part 2**: How to perform remote attestation?

## Sample Applications
### Application #1: Reduce Fraud, Protect the Bank
- **Cloud Services Demand ID**: 
  - **Enterprise**: BYOD
  - **Consumer**: Targeted advertising, eCommerce, mobile banking.
- **Low Friction Authentication**: 
  - Minimize user input to reduce frustration and drop-off rates.
  - **Progressive Authentication**: Use cookies for initial access, defer further authentication until necessary.
- **Enrollment Process**:
  - First-time use requires activation via SMS.
  - After activation, normal sign-in procedures apply.
- **Device Health Check**: Verify device integrity before allowing high-value transactions.
- **Remediation**: Direct users to fix device issues if necessary.

### Application #2: Reduce Fraud, Protect MI6
- **Pseudo-Demo**: Illustrates how to protect sensitive information.

### Application #3: Protect Data
- **Policy-Enforced File Access**: 
  - **BYOD**: Download sensitive files from a document repository.
  - **Weaknesses**:
    - Rapidly evolving UEFI toolkits.
    - Provisioning and TPM EK database management.
    - Integrity of TPM hardware.
    - Unprotected hibernate files.
    - Trend towards firmware over hardware.
    - Patching delays and whitelist maintenance.
