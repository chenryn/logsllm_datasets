### Session Profile for a Single Client in the Zoom Test Session

**Figure 2** illustrates the session profile for a single client in the Zoom test session, as referenced in Figure 1. 

- **Figure 2(a): Connection Profile**
  - This subfigure displays the TCP and UDP connections used during a Zoom session.
  - The vertical axis represents a monotonically increasing ID number for each connection (TCP, UDP, or ICMP) in the order of their creation.
  - The horizontal axis shows the elapsed time duration for each connection.
  - A typical Zoom session includes four horizontal lines per participant: one TCP connection and three nearly simultaneous UDP connections with similar durations.
  - An exception occurs when switching between P2P mode (with a single UDP connection) and Zoom server mode, where three new UDP connections are created, while the TCP connection remains constant.

- **Figure 2(b): Port Profile**
  - This subfigure shows the port numbers used by each client connection, which can reveal OS-specific behaviors.
  - Notably, the UDP port numbers are consecutive, suggesting the use of Microsoft Windows.
  - The P2P session occurs on a distinctly different port than the others.
  - Due to the vertical scale, some concurrent UDP connections may appear merged, but they are separate as shown in Figure 2(a).

- **Figure 2(c): IP Profile**
  - This subfigure stitches together disrupted connections (if any) and groups them based on the clientâ€™s IP address.
  - TCP and UDP connections are vertically offset to avoid visual overlap, and UDP connections are bundled to reduce clutter, especially when multiple clients are displayed.

### Anomalous Zoom Sessions

The session profile plot is a valuable visualization tool for assessing Zoom session quality and identifying anomalous sessions.

- **Figure 3** depicts the session profile from a Zoom meeting with very poor quality, including two Zoom restarts and two additional audio outages.
  - **Figure 3(a)**: Numerous disruptions to the TCP control channel, with about 40 connection attempts, though only four impairments were noticeable to the user. The two Zoom restarts resulted in new UDP connections for all three channels (labeled 'AVD' in Figure 3(c)). Two other disruptions to the audio channel (labeled 'A') also led to new UDP connections.
  - **Figure 3(b)**: Dynamic port selection for the disrupted audio channel is evident, while the TCP control channel's port numbers are often contiguous.
  - **Figure 3(c)**: The IP profile shows the overall structure of the Zoom session, highlighting the many disruptions to the TCP channel, which affected the control channel and Zoom connectivity. The UDP channels had fewer disruptions but still degraded session quality.

- **Surprising Insights**: Even small Zoom meetings in P2P mode can experience disruptions. For example, a two-person meeting with one participant on campus and the other at home showed that the on-campus laptop had normal UDP connections but repeated disruptions to the TCP connection for over half an hour. Analysis of the Wireshark trace and campus-level data revealed numerous connection resets, often alternating with another campus host trying to set up a different meeting with the same Zoom server.

### Large-Scale Measurements

Our next set of measurements focuses on larger examples of Zoom sessions extracted from our campus network traffic logs.

- **Figure 4(a)**: Time series plot of aggregate Zoom traffic on our campus network for a representative day (September 22, 2021). The graph shows the total number of concurrent UDP 8801 connections to Zoom MMR servers, the number of Zoom sessions, and Zoom meetings. On this day, the peak load reached about 3,500 concurrent UDP connections, representing about 1,100 Zoom sessions in about 250 different concurrent Zoom meetings. The diurnal pattern corresponds to campus activity, with usage peaking mid-day and declining towards the evening. Class schedules are evident in the overall Zoom traffic.

- **Figure 4(b)**: IP frequency-rank plot showing the relative frequency of different Zoom MMR server IPs used for meetings. The top three/24 Zoom network prefixes accounted for 42%, 35%, and 13% of the meetings, using 183, 150, and 76 MMR servers, respectively. Each MMR server was used, on average, about 40 times during the week, or about 6 times each day.

### Session Characteristics

By focusing on a single Zoom server IP address, we can identify specific Zoom sessions for classes or meetings. We check the consistency of end times and data volumes exchanged on each connection to determine the number of participants and assess arrival patterns.

- **Figure 5(a)**: Example from a one-hour Zoom session with about 40 on-campus participants. The graph shows the average packet size sent and received by each connection, color-coded based on the classification of the channels. One participant was using screen-sharing, and another sent more audio/video and received more control information, consistent with a lecture-based class.
- **Figure 5(b)**: Example of a large meeting with 120 participants, about 30 on campus. More cameras (about 40%) were on during the meeting, and the TCP control channel indicates lots of interaction via the chat interface.

### Session Quality

- **Figure 6**: Session profile for the large Zoom meeting, showing a steep arrival pattern due to the Zoom waiting room. About 40% of the 30 participants had disruptions to their TCP connections, and 30% had disruptions to their UDP-based audio, video, or data channels.

### Anomalous Zoom Behavior

- **Figure 7**: IP profile for a session with about 20 on-campus participants, lasting about an hour. Several disruptions occurred at almost periodic intervals, affecting every participant. The session host's network connectivity was disrupted, leading to Zoom entering a "failover" mode with four concurrent UDP connections. This might reflect Forward Error Correction (FEC) to preserve audio quality.

### Discussion

- **Performance Implications and Recommendations**: The main issue identified is the mismatch between supply and demand. The use of mixed learning modalities quadrupled Zoom traffic demand compared to the previous year, while directing this traffic to a limited set of regional Zoom servers. Network administrators and Zoom software engineers should consider strategies to improve Zoom performance, such as optimizing server allocation and enhancing network infrastructure.
