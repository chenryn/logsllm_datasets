**Title: Deepfake Social Engineering: A Framework for Synthetic Media Social Engineering**

**Abstract:**

How can you be certain that the person you are communicating with is who they claim to be? Deepfake and other synthetic media technologies have revolutionized social engineering, presenting one of the most significant threats in recent history. In recent years, scammers have exploited synthetic audio in vishing attacks, impersonating executives to deceive employees into transferring funds to unauthorized accounts. In March 2021, the FBI issued a warning to the security community, predicting a substantial increase in synthetic media-enabled scams over the next 18 months.

We are at a critical juncture where trust in our sensory experiences—what we see and hear—is being eroded. This presentation introduces the **Synthetic Media Social Engineering (SMSE) Framework** to categorize and understand these attacks. The SMSE Framework includes five key dimensions:

1. **Medium**: Text, audio, video, or a combination.
2. **Interactivity**: Pre-recorded, asynchronous, or real-time.
3. **Control**: Human puppeteer, software, or a hybrid.
4. **Familiarity**: Unfamiliar, familiar, or close.
5. **Intended Target**: Human or automation, an individual target, or a broader audience.

While several technological solutions exist to detect synthetic media, this presentation focuses on human-centric countermeasures. These methods are more accessible and practical for the average user, as many technology-based solutions are not readily available and are challenging to apply in real-time.

**Human-Centric Countermeasures:**

1. **Behavioral Analysis**: Train users to identify inconsistencies between the behaviors of the legitimate person and a synthetic media puppet. For example, unusual speech patterns, lack of contextual awareness, or emotional disconnects.
2. **Proof-of-Life Statements**: Require proof-of-life statements to counter virtual kidnappings. These statements should be unique and verifiable, such as asking the person to perform a specific action or provide a piece of information known only to them.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA for financial transactions to ensure that multiple forms of verification are required before any transfer is authorized.
4. **Multi-Person Authorization**: Require multiple people to authorize high-value or sensitive transactions. This adds an additional layer of security and reduces the risk of successful deception.

These "old-school" solutions, when combined with the proposed SMSE Framework, will help individuals and organizations adapt to the new reality of synthetic media social engineering attacks. This presentation aims to equip the audience with the knowledge and tools necessary to protect themselves and their organizations from these emerging threats.
