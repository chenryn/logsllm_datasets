I am trying to override Grid class names injected by Material-UI, I use the
following prop
    const styles = {
      myspacing: {
        // The below nest style is NOT WORKING
        '& > $typeItem': {
          padding: 0,
        },
        padding: 0,
      }
    }
  * [ x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
After overriding, I want the grid items have following style
    .MuiGrid-spacing-xs-24-1120 > .MuiGrid-typeItem-1098 {
        padding: 0px;
    }
## Current Behavior
But it seems doesn't work, The devtool still shows the following:
    .MuiGrid-spacing-xs-24-1120 > .MuiGrid-typeItem-1098 {
         padding: 12px;
    }
