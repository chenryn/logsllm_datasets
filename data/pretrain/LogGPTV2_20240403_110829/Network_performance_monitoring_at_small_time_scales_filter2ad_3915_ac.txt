Figure 5: Fraction of overloaded intervals across
time for diﬀerent values of th and τ (OC-3).
4.2.2 OC-12 results
In Fig. 6 we present the results for the OC-12 data set
for τ equal to 1ms, 10 ms, and 100 ms and th equal to
50%, 60% and 70%. We observe that the time scales of 10
and 100 ms report a greater number for the fraction of over-
loaded intervals only when th = 50%. The largest number of
“congested” intervals occurs toward the end of the trace af-
ter 12pm local time. Link utilization measurements at 1 ms
intervals rarely exceed 70% (their fraction is less than 0.05)
and only marginally exceed 60% (their fraction reaches 0.2
at most).
Consequently, the number of micro-congestion episodes in
the OC-12 data set is signiﬁcantly smaller but not negligi-
ble. In addition, given that the amplitude of these episodes
hardly reaches 60% we anticipate that their impact on the
performance observed by packets is going to be limited.
5. VALIDATION
In summary, we conclude that by looking at time scales
below 100 ms and across diﬀerent values of th we can char-
acterize the amplitude of the micro-congestion episode. If
the throughput measured at 10 ms is greater than 60% on
an OC-3 link then according to Fig. 2 we expect delays to
be signiﬁcant. By observing the results for the same value
of th and across time scales we can identify the duration
above 50%, any other coarser time scale will provide us with
similar results and thus is omitted.

and frequency of the episodes. For instance, if high values
of threshold are accompanied by high fraction of overloaded
intervals for the smallest time scale alone, we have an indi-
cation that the micro-congestion episodes do not last long.
Our proposed SNMP metric will be useful within an op-
erational context if it is able to reveal congestion through
time in a way that actually relates to degradation in perfor-
mance. To address this speciﬁc issue we look into the delays
experienced by packets for our two data sets during the en-
tire duration of the trace. In Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 we present
the delay statistics collected for each 5-minute interval in
the trace for set1 and set2 respectively.

Figure 7: Delay statistics computed over 5 minute
intervals across time (OC-3).
Fig. 7 shows that packets going through the monitored
router may experience delays that reach 1 ms. Neverthe-
less this behavior is only observed for the ﬁrst part of the
trace until 3 pm. After 3pm the measured delays show a
signiﬁcant drop. From an operational standpoint it would
be beneﬁcial if one knew about the periods in time when
packets experience larger delays and what their amplitudes
are.
Returning to Fig. 5 we notice that until 3 pm all three
time scales report utilization levels greater than 50%.
In
addition, until 3 pm 30% of the 1 ms measurements in each
5 minute interval exceed 70% utilization. Therefore, micro-
congestion episodes for the ﬁrst 6 hours in the trace are
signiﬁcant in terms of amplitude and persist in time so that
they aﬀect the time scale of 10 ms and 100 ms. Simple
observation of the collected statistics at the 100 ms time
scale alone when th = 50% would lead to the same ﬁndings;
micro-congestion in the ﬁrst 6 hours that may lead to delays
in the order of 1 ms according to Fig. 2. Nevertheless, collec-
tion of statistics at multiple time scales allows the network
operator to investigate the reasons behind these episodes.
If the reason is micro-congestion then utilization measure-
ments at small time scales should exhibit signiﬁcant ﬂuctu-
ations. Consequently, not all 1 ms intervals should report
utilization levels greater than 50% and some small fraction
of those should report signiﬁcantly higher utilization levels,
as is the case for set1. On the other hand, if 100% of the 1
ms intervals report utilization levels greater than 50% then
there is an indication of persistent congestion that should
be further researched.

Figure 8: Delay statistics computed over 5 minute
intervals across time (OC-12).
Our results for the OC-12 data set3 are presented in Fig.
8. Delays experienced by packets through the monitored
router are under 100 µs and increase toward the end of the
trace. Increase in the single-hop delay occurs after 12 pm.
From Fig. 6 the last 2 hours are characterized by 60% and
80% of the 10 ms and 100 ms intervals respectively exceeding
50% utilization. Approximately 50% of the 1 ms intervals
exceed similar levels of activity. The amplitude of the delay
can be inferred by observing that 20% of the 1 ms intervals
exceed 60% utilization for the same period of time. Nev-
ertheless, given that only the 1 ms timescale reports such
high output link utilization values, we can conjecture that
the actual delay values experienced by packets are rather
limited (Fig. 3).
6. DISCUSSION/FUTURE WORK
Our methodology is not speciﬁc to link utilization mea-
surements. Observing diﬀerent performance metrics for dif-
ferent levels of activity (th) and across multiple time scales
could have further applications. For instance, one could
also collect counters for the number of τ -intervals within a
5-minute interval when output queues exceed speciﬁc thresh-
old values. Observation of the collected results across time
scales can also give insight into how long and how frequently
queues reach speciﬁc occupancy rates.
From our results it can be seen that the most appropriate
values of τ should be less than 100 ms. In [5] the authors
showed that Internet traﬃc exhibits diﬀerent scaling behav-
ior for time scales below 100 ms and above 100 ms. At

longer time scales traﬃc can be characterized as long-range
dependent, while at shorter time scales it appears almost un-
correlated or lightly correlated. In future work we would like
to investigate the relationship between the work presented
in [5] and our work.
Identiﬁcation of the factors aﬀecting the time scale over
which micro-congestion episodes manifest themselves clearly
calls for additional information. We are currently in the
process of installing monitoring equipment on all the active
links of a router inside the operational Sprint IP backbone
network. Extensive monitoring of an operational router will
not only allow us to identify the factors aﬀecting micro-
congestion episodes, but also possibly quantify the eﬀect
that diﬀerent factors have on the measured behavior.
Our ultimate goal is to make recommendations about traf-
ﬁc metrics that would be useful in an operational setting for
the provisioning of IP networks. Such metrics, like the one
presented in this work, would provide priceless insight into
the traﬃc dynamics and could greatly improve current best
practices in the area of link dimensioning and network pro-
visioning based on SNMP measurements.
7. CONCLUSIONS
We presented an experimental analysis for the characteri-
zation of congestion episodes that occur at time scales much
smaller than what is normally observed by operators. We
showed that currently available SNMP metrics collected over
intervals of 5 minutes mask out the existence of such short-
lived episodes and thus are inappropriate for the link/queue
dimensioning of IP links. We presented a methodology for
the identiﬁcation of micro-congestion episodes that is capa-
ble of characterizing them with respect to their amplitude,
duration and frequency. Our approach relies on the analysis
of link utilization at multiple time scales simultaneously. We
showed that this type of analysis can provide great insight
into the dynamics of the traﬃc at small time scales and their
impact on the delay experienced by packets.
The time scales at which congestion occurs may in fact
vary, but appear to be below 100 ms. We proposed perfor-
mance metrics that can be collected over 5-minute intervals
shedding light into the behavior of Internet traﬃc at these
time scales. Our data sets here are fairly limited, and a
more comprehensive analysis is needed. However, our pre-
liminary investigation suggests that collection of such data
would provide much greater insight into the dynamic behav-
ior of IP networks than is currently available, as well as what
could be obtained by observing performance at a single time
scale.
