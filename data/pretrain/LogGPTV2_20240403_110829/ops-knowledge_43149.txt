Question: Which of the following techniques would an adversary MOST likely use to dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure and evade common detections?
"A": "Initiating multiple SSL/TLS handshakes to random IP addresses to obfuscate the destination of the actual command and control server.",
"B": "Using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure to adjust parameters such as domain name, IP address, or port number for command and control.",
"C": "Deploying a static list of fallback IP addresses in malware to ensure continued communication with the command and control server.",
"D": "Registering all potential domain names in advance to ensure that malware can always resolve to a command and control server."
Answer: B
