ABSTRACT
In this paper we present an identity-set-based broadcast en-
cryption scheme with three working modes: positive mem-
bership (Select-mode), all member (All-mode), and negative
membership (Cut-mode) over the user identity set, simulta-
neously. The core of our scheme is the implementation of
cryptographic representation of subset by using two aggre-
gation functions: Zeros-based aggregation and Poles-based
aggregation. These two aggregation functions are capable of
compressing any subset into one element in a bilinear map
group for determining the membership between an element
and a subset. Our scheme achieves the optimal bound of
O(1)-size for either ciphertext (consisting of just two ele-
ments) or decryption key (one element) for an identity set
of large size. We prove that our scheme is secure under the
General Diﬃe-Hellman Exponent (GDHE) assumption.

them to a group of users U who are listening to a broadcast
channel and use their private keys to decrypt received mes-
sages. [1, 2, 3] One remarkable feature of broadcast encryp-
tion is that each user has a unique private key. In the public
key setting for n = |U| users, this feature means that broad-
cast encryption has a one-to-many (or 1 : n) public/private
key structure. In other words, many diﬀerent private keys
correspond to one public key. This kind of key structure is
completely diﬀerent from traditional 1 : 1 public/private key
structure. The beneﬁts gained from this 1 : n key structure
include additional functionalities such as traitor tracing [4],
dynamic revocation, and so on.
Broadcast encryption can be widely used in many applica-
tion scenarios ranging from TV subscription services, DVD
copyright protection, and encrypted ﬁle systems, to secure
communication of social networks, e.g., Email, Blog, We-
b communities. Existing broadcast encryption schemes can
be roughly categorized into two groups (related work is dis-
cussed in Section 7):
• Category I: Broadcast for multiple designated receiver-
s where a broadcast message is sent securely to a small
subset of users S and |S| (cid:3) n [2, 5];
• Category II: Broadcast without multiple revoked receivers
where a broadcast message is sent to all BUT a small set
of revoked users R and |R| (cid:3) n [6].
Usually, these two categories of broadcast encryption do not
replace each other when n is large, so they can be thought
as two complementary approaches. There is little system-
atic work for integrating these two categories of broadcast
encryption into a secure BE system [2, 7, 8] from literature.
The two mechanisms, one-time designation or inclusion
(of Category I) and revocation or exclusion (of Category II)
for a subset of users, are extremely important for large-scale
IT systems with large-size users. For example, in email sys-
tem or Blog sites, we often communicate with several spec-
iﬁed friends, but also sometimes broadcast to almost users
in community. To sum up, we list some desirable features
for developing a practical and ﬂexible BE scheme:
1. The scheme should be able to support large-size users and
new user’s joining at an arbitrary time;
2. Two broadcast mechanisms, designation and revocation,
should be supported simultaneously, and the ciphertext
size should be independent on the number of designated
or revoked users;
1913. For easy-to-use, the user’s identity (similar as identity-
based encryption) should be employed to memory and
distinguish the diﬀerent users;
Our Motivation and Roadmap. In this paper our goal is
to develop a new group-oriented encryption which supports
two broadcast mechanisms, designation and revocation, si-
multaneously. We believe that the foundation of construct-
ing such an encryption system is to achieve cryptographic
decisional problem of set membership, that is, given a sub-
set S and an element e in U, determine whether or not e
belongs to S (i.e., e ∈ S or e (cid:5)∈ S) in a secure (or non-
deceptive) way. Obviously, our desired cryptosystem could
be constructed by solving the above problem.

Figure 1: Example of cryptographic representation
of subset and aggregation function.
Our approach of solving the above problem is to realize
the cryptographic representation of any given subset, and
then design a secure aggregation function to compress the
subset into a constant-size random element, which would be
used to construct our desired encryption system. Further,
we show an example of our approach in Figure 1, in which
such an approach can be realized by four following steps:
1. Given a set U = {e1,··· , en}, we map each element ei into
a random point vi in cryptographic space, where the par-
tial information of these points is published as the public
key mpk (see the red points in Figure 1);
2. Given a subset S ⊆ U, we construct a curve c(x) through
all random points {vi} included in S (see two curves in
Figure 1, each of which was interpolated from points);
3. We introduce a random secret γ and then the aggregation
function is deﬁned as the corresponding point c(γ) in this
curve, that is, Aggregate(mpk,S) → c(γ), where mpk is
the public cryptographic parameters (see the dashed blue
line and the intersections of this line and two curves);
4. We deﬁne the security feature of function that intend to
ensure the security of aggregation under the malicious at-
tacks (see Deﬁnition 3 and 4 in Section 3.1).
Finally, we expect to use this kind of aggregation for devel-
oping our encryption scheme. The privacy and randomness
of aggregation point c(γ) will provide guarantee for the se-
curity of our scheme. Moreover, the compression property
of aggregation function can ensure the O(1)-size ciphertext.
Our Contributions. In this paper we ﬁrst present a new
identity-Set-based Broadcast Encryption (SBE) based on
cryptographic decisional problem of set membership. By
supporting both designation and revocation simultaneously,
our scheme allows a nice property of ”Cut-or-Select”. That
is, a broadcaster is able to send a message to some selected
users or to all but some revoked ones. In detail, our work is
listed as follows:
• We propose a new approach to solve cryptographic deci-
sional problem of set membership by designing two ag-
gregation functions: Zeros-based aggregation and Poles-
based aggregation. Two corresponding fast algorithms are
developed to compress any subset quickly into a constant-
size element for designation and revocation mechanisms.
• We present the construction of a SBE scheme with three
operation modes over the set of user identities: positive
membership, all member, negative membership for any
subset of users, simultaneously. Moreover, our scheme
achieve the optimal bound of O(1)-size for either cipher-
texts or decryption keys.
• We prove the security of two aggregation functions and
provide a complete security proof of our SBE scheme based
on general Diﬃe-Hellman exponent (GDHE) assumption.
Our scheme is secure for arbitrarily large collusion of cor-
rupted users. Moreover, our experiments show that our
SBE scheme is simple, easy-to-implement and high per-
formance, as well as short (128-byte) and constant-size
ciphertext for any size subset.
Organization. The preliminaries and deﬁnition of SBE are
provided in Section 2. We propose an eﬀective solution for
cryptographic set membership in 3.1. Our SBE scheme in
Section 3. We present the security and performance analysis
in Section 4, 5, and 6. Related work is presented in Section
7 and Section 8 concludes the Lab.
2. OUR DEFINITION OF SBE
We now give a formal deﬁnition of identity-Set-based Broad-
cast Encryption (SBE) with key encapsulation mechanism
[2], which is made up of four algorithms, shown as follows:
Setup(S): takes as input a bilinear map group system S.
It outputs a public key mpk and a master secret key
msk, where mpk contains a list of user’s proﬁles pp.
KeyGen(msk, IDk): takes as input msk and a user’s iden-
tity IDk. It outputs the user’s secret key skk and adds
a user’s proﬁle ppk to pp, i.e., pp = pp ∪ {ppk}.
Encrypt(mpk, S, mode): takes as input mpk, a set of user’s
identities S, and a mode of operation mode, where
mode belongs to one of three modes in {u ∈ S, u ∈
All, u (cid:5)∈ S}. It outputs a ciphertext C and a random
session key ek, where (S, mode) is included in C.
Decrypt(mpk, skk, C): takes as input mpk, a ciphertext C,
and a user’s secret key skk. If this user satisﬁes the
access mode mode then the algorithm will decrypt the
ciphertext C and return a session key ek.
In SBE scheme, the user’s proﬁle includes the identity of
this user and a public parameter generated in registry. Our
scheme makes use of these proﬁles to realize encryption and
decryption for a subset of users. As a group-oriented cryp-
tosystem, we employ a list of proﬁles to realize the manage-
ment of memberships. According to the diﬀerent of opera-
tions, the set of users S will be used in three cases:
Select-mode (u ∈ S): used to specify multiple receivers,
where S denotes a set of speciﬁed users, such that the
user u ∈ S will be authorized to decrypt the message.
All-mode (u ∈ All): used to specify all receivers, and all
users is speciﬁed to decrypt the message.
192Cut-mode (u (cid:5)∈ S): used to revoke multiple receivers, where
S denotes a set of revoked users, such that the user
u (cid:5)∈ S will be authorized to decrypt the message.
Consider all possible mpk from Setup(S) → (mpk, msk), a
valid ciphertext C from Encrypt(mpk,S, mode) → (C, ek)
and KeyGen(msk, IDk) → skk. If the user’s identity IDk
satisﬁes the operation mode (S, mode) in C, then the de-
cryption algorithm will retrieve the session key ek, i.e.,

3. OUR CONSTRUCTION
3.1 Aggregation Functions of Subsets
In this section, we illustrate our basic idea to design cryp-
tographic construction for set membership. In our idea, the
core notion is cryptographic representation of subset based
on aggregation functions. Given a set U, an aggregation
function is a cryptographic function to compress the infor-
mation of any subset S ⊆ U into a constant-size value. The
output of aggregation function is called the cryptographic
representation of subset. The deﬁnition of this function is
stated as follows:
Definition 1
(Aggregate function). Let PK denote
the public key space over a group G and U = {e1,··· , en} be
a set of elements, the function Aggregate : PK × 2U → G
is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm satisfying:
Aggregate(mpk,S) = RS ,
(1)
where mpk is the public key in PK, a subset S ⊆ U, and RS
is a random enough element in G to avoid guessing.
Definition 2
This kind of aggregation function is our core in our SBE
scheme and foundation of cryptographic decisional problem
of set membership (see Section 1). In this paper, we use this
kind of function to build membership and negative mem-
bership. More importantly, the constant size ciphertext can
be implemented in our SBE scheme only if the compression
property can be eﬃciently realized. Based on the presented
approach in Section 1, we present two aggregate function-
s, ZerosAggr and PolesAggr, that realize the decision over
positive membership and negative membership, respectively.
Before our aggregation functions are introduced, we ﬁrst
give the deﬁnition of zeros and poles in a function as follows:
(Zeros and Poles). A rational polyno-
mial function has the form H(x) = P (x)
Q(x) that is the quotient
of two polynomial P (x) and Q(x). We say the value z is a
zero of H(x) if P (z) = 0, and z is a pole of H(x) if Q(z) = 0.
Next, we propose two aggregation functions, ZerosAggr
and PolesAggr, for u ∈ {vi} and u (cid:5)∈ {vi} as below. Given a
subset S = {e
m} ⊆ U, we deﬁne a polynomial fS (x)
(cid:3)
of degree m + 1 over S,
fS (x) = x(x+x
(mod p),
in which the hash value of elements in S is considered as the

negative root of this polynomial and let x
Next, given a secret γ, we propose the deﬁnition of aggre-
gation function that can aggregate the information of S in-
to the constant-size value gfS (γ) based on the polynomial
fS (x). We call it the Zeros-based Aggregation (in short,
ZerosAggr) function which is deﬁned as follows:
