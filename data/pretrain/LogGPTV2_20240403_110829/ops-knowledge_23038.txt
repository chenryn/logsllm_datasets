User: I need a simple interpreter which will do execution (evaluation) of simple expressions/statements and also call functions from main C++ applications. At the moment I do not need scripting of the application, but it may be useful later.
It should also be strait-forward for other team members to pull my application from Source Repository and to build it, without having to install additional application, libraries, etc.
Searching reveled options like: Python (via Boost and / or Python API), Lua, Guile, TinyScheme.
I am the closest to Python, but using Boost, building Python library, complicated task of interfacing main application with Python makes this choice an overkill, maybe I am wrong.
There should be a simple solution for this request, what are your experiences and suggestions?
Assistant: Guile is easy to embed and extend, and scheme if powerfull programming language.
You can compile libguile and add it to the repository in lib directory or add source for guile and compile it when user compile the project.
But I don't try to use guile on Windows.
