applications for OSINT investigations. You could log in to a Google account within this Android device and 
download applications through the Play Store, but I present an alternative. I don't like to associate a Google 
account with my investigations, so I download my apps anonymously with the following steps.
• 
Within the /Indroid virtual machine, open the Chrome browser.
• 
If prompted, deselect the option to share analytics data with Google.
• 
If prompted, deny use of a Google account
• 
Search "F Droid" within the browser and click the first link.
• 
Click the "Download F-Droid" button then "Continue" to authorize the download.
• 
Click "Allow" and "OK" if prompted, then open F-Droid.
• 
Click "Settings" to enable the toggle to authorize installation.
• 
Click the top back arrow, then "Install", then "Open".
• 
Click the search option in the lower-right and search "aurora store".
• 
Select the Aurora Store application and click "Install".
• 
Click "Settings" to enable the toggle to authorize installation.
• 
Click the top back arrow, then "Install", then "Open".
• 
Click "Next", then "Ask", then "Allow" to authorize this new app.
• 
Choose "Anonymous" in order to avoid providing a Google account to download apps.
• 
Search for "Facebook" and choose the "Install" option.
• 
Click "Settings" to enable the toggle to authorize installation.
• 
Click the top back arrow, then "Install", then "Open".
Let's digest these steps. You installed F-Droid which is an open-source package installer for Android. It allowed 
us to install Aurora Store which is an anonymous replacement for Google's Play Store. Through Aurora Store, 
you installed Facebook to ensure the ability to add apps. You authorized all applications to install additional 
apps on your device, which should only be a one-time requirement You can now launch Aurora Store and install 
practically any app desired. During this writing, I installed the following apps and moved them to my home 
screen.

seem to stop communicating, check and be sure that "Wi-Fi" is enabled. I have experienced unexplained internet 
outages which were corrected by re-enabling Wi-Fi under "Settings". The easiest way to turn the device off is to 
click the "X" to close the VirtualBox window and then choose "Send the Shutdown Signal". This notifies the 
Android device that you wish to shut down and presents the appropriate pop-up menu to the right. From there, 
you can select the "Power Off or "Restart" option. If this menu is not presented, you can repeat this process 
and choose "Power off the machine" within VirtualBox. Finally, I do not like the default pink wallpaper, so 1

My biggest complaint about any virtual Android environment, including this platform and those within premium 
third-party software solutions, is the overall speed and usability. There will always be a lag from the moment 
you click an app to the point where entry' can be made. Unlike our previous Linux VMs, increasing our memory 
and processor resources does not seem to help with this issue. My only advice is as follows.
Figure 7.02 displays my final result. Many of these apps rely' on location data, which is missing from our virtual 
device. There is no GPS chip, true Wi-Fi receiver, or cellular tower connection. Therefore, we must "spoof our 
location in order to benefit from location-based applications. 1 prefer the application called Fake GPS. Open 
the application and follow the prompts to enable "Mock Locations". If die automated process fails, conduct the 
following.
• 
Open "Settings" and navigate to "System" then "About Tablet".
• 
Click "Build Number" seven times until Developer options are enabled.
• 
In "Settings" navigate to "System" then "Developer Options".
• 
Click "Select Mock Location App" and choose "Fake GPS".
• 
Close settings and open die "Fake GPS" application.
0 Zoom into your desired area and click the "play" icon in the lower-right.
• 
Open Chrome and navigate to maps.google.com.
• 
Ensure that Maps believes you are at the spoofed location.
perform all updates and automated tasks before
• 
Always boot the /Xndroid device and allow it to 
beginning any' investigations.
• 
An Android device with minimal apps may perform better for specific investigations.
• 
Do not open numerous apps at once. Focus only on the current task.
• 
If the devices appear unusually' slow, reboot and begin again.
Android Emulation 119
120 Chapter?
After you have your desired location configured and you have confirmed accuracy, you can start to put this 
feature to work The following tutorials explain how 1 use various mobile applications within my OSINT 
investigations, especially location-aware applications which allow me to spoof my location. This could never be 
a complete documentation. Any time you encounter a target using a service which possesses a mobile 
application, you should consider installing that app to sec what further details you can obtain about the target's 
profile.
Kik Messenger: Kik is an instant messaging application for mobile devices. It is modeled after BlackBerry s 
Messenger and uses a smartphone's data plan or Wi-Fi to transmit and receive messages. It also allows users to 
share photos, sketches, mobile webpages, and other content. You must create a free account within the app and 
you can then search any username or Kik number. Many users do not share personal details, but you can still 
use the app during your investigation for covert communication with a target. I warn you that child exploitation 
is prominent on Kik Messenger. Pedophiles have been quoted in news sources stating, "I could go on it now 
and probably within 20 minutes have videos, pictures, everything else in between off the app. That's where all 
the child porn is coming off of*. In 2014, a parent confiscated her 15-year-old daughter's cellular telephone after 
it was discovered that the minor was sending nude photos of herself to an older man at his request. 1 was able 
to use my Android emulator to log in as the child; continue conversations with the pedophile; and develop 
evidence to be used during prosecution. Documentation was easy with screen captures and screen recording.
WhatsApp: WhatsApp Messenger is an instant messaging app for smartphones that operates under a 
subscription business model. In addition to text messaging, WhatsApp can be used to send images, videos, and 
audio media messages to other users. Locations can also be shared through the use of integrated mapping 
features. \ ou will need to create an account and provide a telephone number for verification. This number can 
be a cellular, landline, or VOIP number. I have had success using free Google Voice and MySudo numbers. 
After you have an account, you can communicate direcdy with any’ target using the service. I have found that 
several of my targets refuse to converse over traditional text messaging, but freely’ text over WhatsApp. If you 
conduct any online covert operations, y’ou should have this set up ahead of time.
Twitter The first time that you use Twitter within your Android environment, you might be asked if you want 
to share your location. While I usually’ discourage this type of activity’, sharing y’o ur spoofed location can have 
many’ benefits. Similar to Facebook, you can make y’ourself appear to be somewhere which y’ou are not. You 
may want to confuse your target. If you know that he or she will be monitoring your social networks using the 
techniques in later chapters, this method should throw them off and be misleading.
Snapchat: For the past few years, I have been unable to connect through the Snapchat app while using 
Genymotion. While writing this chapter, I was able to connect through one account but not another. Making 
Snapchat work within your emulator will be hit or miss. If you plan to communicate with targets direcdy through 
the mobile app, spending time testing these connections is justified. If you simply want to search public posts, 
we will tackle that via a traditional browser later in the book.
Facebook/Mcsscnger/Instagram: The Facebook app on Android will appear similar to a compressed view 
of a standard profile page. The benefit of the mobile app is the ability’ to check into places. After launching the 
app and logging in for the first time, allow Facebook to access your location (which is spoofed). When you click 
the "Check In" option, Facebook will present businesses near your current spoofed location. With my’ test 
configuration, Facebook presented the terminals and airlines at the LAX airport. If y’ou choose a location, and 
create a post on your timeline, Facebook will verify that you were there. I have used this when I need to portray 
that I am somewhere I am not This method can help y’ou establish credibility’ within y’our pseudo profile. You 
could easily create the illusion that you were working at a business all day’ or out clubbing all night. I also once 
helped a domestic violence victim confuse her ex-husband with this technique. I posted from her Facebook 
account accidentally leaving my spoofed location enabled. He stalked her every’ move online. After wasting 
his time going to random places trying to find her, and always finding the location to be closed, he began 
doubting the information that he uncovered about her whereabouts.
Android Emulation 121
TikTok: As of October 2020, TikTok surpassed over 2 billion mobile downloads worldwide and established 
itself as a dominant social network. While 1 will explain investigation techniques for this network much later in 
the book, having the mobile app ready is vital. The TikTok website does not currendy allow native keyword 
search, but the mobile app does. Preparation now will provide great benefit later.
Secure Eraser As time passes, the size of your Android virtual devices will grow. System and app updates alone 
will increase the size of your files quickly. Much of this size is unnecessary’. When these virtual machines
Truecaller: A later chapter explains reverse caller ID services and how they can identify subscriber information 
associated with telephone numbers. There are several additional services that only support mobile use. Truecaller 
is a powerful service which allows search of unlimited cellular and landline numbers in order to identify the 
owners. Other options include Mr. Number and Showcaller.
TextNow. If you conduct online investigations and communicate with a suspect, it is very' possible that you 
may be asked to send or receive a standard SMS text message. Since your virtual device does not possess a 
cellular connection, and it is not assigned a telephone number, there are no native opportunities for this activity. 
However, you can install TextNow, which allows you to send and receive SMS text messages. With this setup, 
you can conduct all of your communications through the virtual device, and preserve the evidence within a 
single archive.
Badoo/Blendr/Bumble/Skout/Down: These dating apps use various databases of user profiles. They are 
similar to Tinder, but some do not require a Facebook account or telephone number. This could be an additional 
option for locating a target who uses dating apps. The same method applied to Tinder would work on these 
networks. I once used these during a cheating spouse investigation. I connected with a covert female Facebook 
profile who was recently accepted as a "friend" with the suspected cheating spouse. Launching the Down app 
confirmed that he had an account. Swiping "Down" on his profile alerted him that I wanted to "get down" with 
him. This quickly resulted in a very’ incriminating chat that was later used in litigation. In addition to identifying 
the location of targeted individuals, these apps could be used to identify people who are currently at a crime 
scene or gathering. I once used this technique to simply document people who were present near a state capitol 
during a credible bomb threat. When these people denied their presence during interviews, I had data that 
disagreed with their statements. Those who were lying quickly recanted their false statements and saved 
investigators a large amount of time.
Secure Communications Apps: If you plan to communicate directly with targets of your investigation, you 
should be familiar with the popular secure communication preferences. Asking a suspect of a sex trafficking 
investigation to text you via cellular telephone number will not be well received. If you possess a secure 
ProtonMail email address or Wire encrypted communications username, your request may be honored. 
Possessing these apps within your Android environment allows you to contain the evidence within a VM and 
protect your host machine. You could also possess multiple accounts through these providers and log in only 
after cloning your machine, as explained later.
Tinder: This dating app relies on your location in order to recommend people in your area that want to "hook 
up". It can use your Facebook account associated with your device or a VOIP telephone number for the login 
credentials. The preferences menu will allow you to specify the gender, age range, and distance of the targeted 
individuals. Most people use this to identify’ members of their sexual preference within one mile of their current 
location. The users can then chat within the app. I have used this to identify whether a target was at home or 
another location.
During one investigation, I discovered that my target was a Tinder user. I set my GPS in my Android emulator 
to his residence. 1 could then search for men his age within one mile and identify' if he was at home. If I did not 
get his profile as a result, 1 could change my GPS to his work address or favorite bar. When I received his profile 
in the results, I knew that he was near the spoofed location. I could do all of this from anywhere in the world. 
If the app tells you it cannot see your location, you may need to try' another GPS spoofing app.

There are many other similar apps. Now that you have an idea of how to integrate mobile applications into your 
investigations, you can apply the same techniques to the next future wave of popular apps. Many social network 
apps have no association with location. This content can still have value to an investigation. Some apps, such as 
Kik, only function within a portable device. You cannot load a web browser on a traditional computer and 
participate with these networks. However, you can access them from within your Android virtual machine. The 
goal within this chapter is simply preparation. While we have not yet discussed specific investigation methods 
within these sendees, having a virtual Android device ready now will ease the explanations later.
I previously mentioned that Android devices created directly within VirtualBox are preferred over those 
provided through third parties. I stand by those statements, but 1 also respect readers who may prefer other 
options. Genymotion may have undesired issues in regard to privacy and licensing, but the product can also be 
more beneficial than the previous example. Many readers report that Genymotion Android VMs load faster, feel 
smoother, and seem more intuitive. This application-based Android solution is extremely easy to use. It works 
with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

download new’ data and update the files, the old files remain, and are not usable. Basically, your virtual devices 
start to take up a lot of space for no reason. Secure Eraser helps with this. On your original copy, after you have 
updated all of your software, launch Secure Eraser and change Random to 0000-0000. Click the start button and 
allow the process to complete. This will remove all of the deleted files. Restart your machine and then clone or 
export the device. The new’ copy will reflect the reduction of file size, but the original will still be large. During 
this w’riting, my Android VM grew to 18GB. After completing the eraser process and cloning the device, the 
new' VM w'as only 6.5GB, but was identical to the original.
Execute this application and note that an Android virtual machine may already be pre-installed and ready for 
launch. Instead of accepting this default option, consider creating your own machine in order to learn the process 
for future investigations. I recommend deleting this machine by clicking the menu icon to the right of the device 
and choosing "Delete". Perform the following instructions in order to create your first custom Android devices.
First, you must create a free account online at genymotion.com. This can be all alias information, and the login 
will be required in order to fully use the application. After you have created the account and successfully logged 
in to the site, navigate to genyTOotion.com/fun-zone and click on the "Download Genymotion Personal 
Edition" link. This presents the standard download page for Window’s, Mac, and Linux. If prompted, choose 
the version without VirtualBox, as j’ou should alreadj’ have that program installed. Executing the download and 
accepting all default installation options will install all of the required files. When the setup process has 
completed, you will have a new icon on your desktop tided Genj’motion. This entire process should occur on 
your HOST operating system, and not within a virtual machine.

You should now have a functioning replica of a standard Android device. However, you are missing several 
features. The biggest void is the absence of key applications such as Google Play and Gmail. Without core 
Google sendees, you cannot download apps to your device as part of your investigation tools. This has been the
