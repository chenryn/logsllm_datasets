### Applications for OSINT Investigations

When conducting OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) investigations, you might consider using an Android device to download and use various applications. While you can log in to a Google account on the device and download apps through the Play Store, I prefer an alternative method that allows me to download and use apps anonymously. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Within the /Indroid Virtual Machine:**
   - Open the Chrome browser.
   - If prompted, deselect the option to share analytics data with Google.
   - Deny the use of a Google account if prompted.

2. **Download F-Droid:**
   - Search "F-Droid" in the browser and click the first link.
   - Click the "Download F-Droid" button, then "Continue" to authorize the download.
   - Click "Allow" and "OK" if prompted, then open F-Droid.
   - Go to "Settings" and enable the toggle to authorize installation.
   - Click the top back arrow, then "Install," and finally "Open."

3. **Install Aurora Store:**
   - In F-Droid, search for "Aurora Store" in the lower-right search option.
   - Select the Aurora Store application and click "Install."
   - Enable the toggle in "Settings" to authorize installation.
   - Click the top back arrow, then "Install," and finally "Open."
   - Click "Next," then "Ask," and "Allow" to authorize the new app.
   - Choose "Anonymous" to avoid providing a Google account.

4. **Install Facebook:**
   - Search for "Facebook" in Aurora Store and choose the "Install" option.
   - Enable the toggle in "Settings" to authorize installation.
   - Click the top back arrow, then "Install," and finally "Open."

### Summary of the Steps

- **F-Droid:** An open-source package installer for Android.
- **Aurora Store:** An anonymous replacement for Google's Play Store.
- **Facebook:** Installed to ensure the ability to add and use other apps.

You have now authorized all applications to install additional apps on your device, which should only be a one-time requirement. You can now launch Aurora Store and install practically any app desired.

### Working with a Virtual Device

Since we are working with a virtual device, internet access is gained through your host computer. If you experience connectivity issues, ensure that Wi-Fi is enabled. Unexplained internet outages can often be resolved by re-enabling Wi-Fi under "Settings."

To turn off the virtual device:
- Click the "X" to close the VirtualBox window.
- Choose "Send the Shutdown Signal."
- This will notify the Android device to shut down and present a pop-up menu with "Power Off" or "Restart" options.
- If the menu does not appear, repeat the process and choose "Power off the machine" within VirtualBox.

### Customizing the Home Screen

If you don’t like the default pink wallpaper, you can modify your home screen:
- Choose the "Gallery" option, select "Downloads," and pick a black file.
- Click "Set Wallpaper."

### Performance and Usability

The biggest complaint about any virtual Android environment, including this platform and those within premium third-party software solutions, is the overall speed and usability. There will always be a lag from the moment you click an app to the point where entry can be made. Unlike Linux VMs, increasing memory and processor resources does not seem to help. My advice is to:
- Always boot the /Indroid device and allow it to perform all updates and automated tasks before beginning any investigations.
- Use an Android device with minimal apps for specific investigations.
- Avoid opening numerous apps at once; focus only on the current task.
- Reboot the device if it appears unusually slow.

### Spoofing Location Data

Since our virtual device lacks GPS, true Wi-Fi, and cellular tower connections, we must spoof our location to benefit from location-based applications. I recommend using Fake GPS:
- Open "Settings" and navigate to "System" > "About Tablet."
- Click "Build Number" seven times to enable Developer options.
- Navigate to "System" > "Developer Options."
- Click "Select Mock Location App" and choose "Fake GPS."
- Close settings and open the "Fake GPS" application.
- Zoom into your desired area and click the "play" icon in the lower-right.
- Open Chrome and navigate to maps.google.com to confirm the spoofed location.

### Using Mobile Applications in OSINT Investigations

#### Kik Messenger
- Kik is an instant messaging app that uses a smartphone's data plan or Wi-Fi to send and receive messages.
- Create a free account and search for usernames or Kik numbers.
- Be cautious as child exploitation is prevalent on Kik. Use it for covert communication with targets.

#### WhatsApp
- WhatsApp is an instant messaging app that requires a phone number for verification.
- Create an account using a free Google Voice or MySudo number.
- Communicate directly with targets who prefer WhatsApp over traditional text messaging.

#### Twitter
- Share your spoofed location to appear somewhere you are not.
- This can confuse targets who monitor your social networks.

#### Snapchat
- Snapchat may not work consistently in emulators.
- Test connections if you plan to communicate directly with targets via the mobile app.

#### Facebook/Messenger/Instagram
- Use the mobile app to check into places with a spoofed location.
- This can help establish credibility within your pseudo profile.

#### TikTok
- TikTok is a dominant social network that supports keyword searches in the mobile app.
- Prepare by having the mobile app ready for future investigations.

#### Secure Eraser
- Over time, your Android virtual devices will grow in size due to system and app updates.
- Use Secure Eraser to remove unnecessary files and reduce the size of your VM.

#### Truecaller
- Truecaller is a powerful service for identifying owners of cellular and landline numbers.
- Other options include Mr. Number and Showcaller.

#### TextNow
- Install TextNow to send and receive SMS text messages without a cellular connection.
- Preserve evidence within a single archive.

#### Dating Apps (Badoo, Blendr, Bumble, Skout, Down)
- These apps can be used to locate targets who use dating services.
- Use them to identify people at crime scenes or gatherings.

#### Secure Communication Apps
- Familiarize yourself with popular secure communication apps like ProtonMail and Wire.
- Use these apps to contain evidence within a VM and protect your host machine.

#### Tinder
- Tinder relies on your location to recommend potential matches.
- Use GPS spoofing to determine if a target is at a specific location.

### Genymotion Setup

Genymotion is an alternative to VirtualBox for creating Android VMs. It is faster and more intuitive but has privacy and licensing concerns. To set up Genymotion:
- Create a free account at genymotion.com.
- Download and install Genymotion Personal Edition.
- Create a custom Android device with the highest API version and a high-resolution screen.
- Customize the device by removing clutter and adjusting settings.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional and customized Android virtual device ready for your OSINT investigations.
