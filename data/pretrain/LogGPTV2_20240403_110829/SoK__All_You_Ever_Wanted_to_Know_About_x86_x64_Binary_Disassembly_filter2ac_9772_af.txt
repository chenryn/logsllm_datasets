### Function Detection Analysis

We compared various tools for function detection, focusing on their precision and recall. The following table summarizes the results:

| Tool      | Precision (%) | Recall (%) |
|-----------|---------------|------------|
| ANGR      | 99.65         | 97.11      |
| BAP       | 93.92         | 75.26      |
| Ghidra    | 98.98         | 50.46      |
| Radare2   | 98.70         | 42.76      |
| Dyninst   | 99.92         | 97.29      |
| BinaryNinja | 99.40        | 48.46      |
| IDA Pro   | 99.30         | 47.52      |
| ...       | ...           | ...        |

### False Positives in Function Detection

The following table provides statistics on the types of false positives encountered by different tools. The categories include mismatch (wrong pattern matching), J-Tab (wrong handling of jump tables), Scan (wrong detection of tail calls), T-Call (wrong disassembly), and Mis-disa (wrong disassembly).

| Tool      | Mismatch (%) | J-Tab (%) | Scan (%) | T-Call (%) | Mis-disa (%) |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| Dyninst   | 19.20        | 0.05      | 71.61    | 11.70      | 7.01         |
| Ghidra    | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 78.41      | 0.00         |
| Ghidra-NE | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 0.00       | 0.00         |
| ANGR      | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 0.00       | 0.00         |
| ANGR-NS   | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 0.00       | 0.00         |
| BAP       | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 0.00       | 0.00         |
| Radare2   | 0.00         | 0.00      | 0.00     | 0.00       | 0.00         |

### Observations

1. **Commercial Tools vs. Open Source Tools**: Commercial tools generally outperform open source tools in terms of both precision and recall.
2. **Precision and Recall**: For example, ANGR has an average precision of 56.67%, while BAP has an average precision of 86.11%.
3. **False Positive Types**: The most common types of false positives vary among the tools. For instance, Dyninst shows a high percentage of mismatches and scan errors, while Ghidra has a significant number of T-Call errors.

These observations highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different tools in the context of function detection, providing valuable insights for tool selection and improvement.
