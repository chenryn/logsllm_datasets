User: I'm working on an application to provide multi-room audio to devices and have succeeded in keeping audio playing from a file (e.g. mp3) synced using GST and manually using NTP but I can't seem to get a live audio stream to sync.
Essentially I want to be able to stream audio from one device to one or more other devices but rather than them buffering and getting out of sync I want them to all play at around the same time (close enough for any delay to not be noticeable anyway).
Has anyone got any suggestions on ways that this can be achieved or can provide any material discussing the matter? (Search hasn't turned up much)
It's worth noting that this application will be coded in Python.
Assistant: Sorry for bring up an old question but this is something that I am looking into. I believe you need to look at Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is a network control protocol designed for use in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between end points.
This is a much better way of keeping things synchronized. As for sending it to multiple devices looking into multicast addresses.
Hope this helps
