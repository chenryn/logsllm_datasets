**ATT&CK ID:** S0650  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** QakBot

QakBot has been observed to be delivered within ZIP files through the technique of HTML smuggling. This method involves embedding malicious content in seemingly benign HTML pages, which, when opened, trigger the download and execution of the QakBot payload. References [7] and [8] provide further details on this delivery mechanism.
