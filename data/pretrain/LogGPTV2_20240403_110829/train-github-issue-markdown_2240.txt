I build some simple dashboard layout with nextjs and material ui next, but I
face with strange problem that only happened in production.  
The problem is regarding miss class name placement to the component wherever I
click some link that navigate to the current route. I'm not quite sure if it
nextjs problem or material ui problem.  
live example: https://vanilla-nextjs-dashboard.herokuapp.com/
  * [x ] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
All style and class name placed at the right component
## Current Behavior
Normal scenario the component will get this classname  
``  
After I click navigation to the current route (current route dashboard, I
click dashboard). The class name will change to the wrong one.  
``
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Clone https://github.com/tenosiswono/vanilla-nextjs-dashboard
  2. Run production
  3. Login, Navigate to current route
  4. Click on the notification button
