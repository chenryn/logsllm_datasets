I have created a basic dashboard layout using Next.js and Material-UI, but I encountered an unusual issue that only appears in the production environment. The problem involves incorrect class name placement on components when I click a link to navigate to the current route. I'm uncertain whether this is a Next.js or a Material-UI issue.

### Live Example
- [Demo](https://vanilla-nextjs-dashboard.herokuapp.com/)

### Checklist
- [x] I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
All styles and class names should be correctly applied to the respective components.

### Current Behavior
In normal scenarios, the component receives the following class name:
```
className="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-contained"
```

However, after clicking a navigation link to the current route (e.g., navigating from the dashboard to the dashboard), the class name changes to an incorrect one:
```
className="MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-outlined"
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/tenosiswono/vanilla-nextjs-dashboard`
2. Build and run the project in production mode.
3. Log in and navigate to the current route (e.g., Dashboard).
4. Click on the notification button.

### Context
This issue affects the visual consistency of the application, as the wrong class names cause the components to render with incorrect styles.

### Environment
- **Next.js**: latest
- **Node.js**: 6.11.2
- **OS**: Heroku
- **Browser**: Chrome
