I am looking to set up an automated web scraper that will run on Google App Engine using Python. The goal is to scrape a specific website and store the extracted data in an Entity within App Engine. I would appreciate some guidance on the best tools and libraries to use for this task.

I have come across BeautifulSoup, which seems like a viable option. However, I'm curious if there are any other recommendations, particularly those that are compatible with Google App Engine.

Additionally, I understand that lxml is another popular choice, but it relies on C code and is therefore not suitable for use on Google App Engine.
