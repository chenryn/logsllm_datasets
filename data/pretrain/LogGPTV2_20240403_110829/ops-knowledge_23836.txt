User: I am looking to setup a automated screen scraper that will run on Google app engine using python. I want it to scrape the site and put the specified results into a Entity in app engine. I am looking for some directions on what to use. I have seen beautifulsoup but wonder if people could recommend anything else that could run on Google App engine.
Assistant: The other choice is lxml, but it uses C code and so does not work on GAE.
