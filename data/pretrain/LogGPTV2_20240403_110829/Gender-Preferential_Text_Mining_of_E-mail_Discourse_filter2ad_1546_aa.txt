Abstract
This paper describes an investigation of authorship gen-
der attribution mining from e-mail text documents. We used
an extended set of predominantly topic content-free e-mail
document features such as style markers, structural charac-
teristics and gender-preferential language features together
with a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm. Exper-
iments using a corpus of e-mail documents generated by a
large number of authors of both genders gave promising re-
sults for author gender categorisation.
1. Introduction
With the rise in the use of computers and computer net-
works for illegal activities (e.g., fraud, money laundering
etc.), the area of computer forensics has become increas-
ingly important. Computer forensics has rapidly evolved
over the past few years and with a range of different
end-applications (e.g., data recovery, law enforcement, e-
commerce), with each application having different require-
ments. For example, in the traditional law enforcement
area, the primary focus is the prosecution of the perpetra-
tor. Once the crime has been perpetrated, the post-mortem
collection and preservation of the chain of custody of evi-
dence, data analysis, interpretation etc. are undertaken sub-
ject to strict established prosecutorial guidelines. On the
other hand, e-commerce is more concerned with the contin-
ual availability of the on-line business service, so that the
focus is on the timeliness of the cycle of detection, forensic
analysis and reaction.
Computer forensics investigations have to increasingly
deal with e-mail as this is becoming an important form of
communication for many computer users, for both legiti-
mate and illegitimate activities. E-mail is used in many
legitimate activities such as message and document ex-
change. Unfortunately, it can also be misused, for example,
in the distribution of unsolicited junk mail, unauthorised
conveyancing of sensitive information, mailing of offensive
or threatening material. E-mail evidence can be central in
cases of sexual harassment or racial viliﬁcation, threats, bul-
lying and so on.
Some researchers have stated that e-mail is much like
spoken communication. However, there are some impor-
tant differences. For example, e-mail is more rareﬁed than
normal spoken communication. With e-mail, participants
cannot see each other’s faces, hear each other’s voices, or
identify gestures or other visual cues. The information con-
tent in an e-mail can include simple text as well as mark-
up text to convey additional information. Some senders of
e-mail use only natural language text to formulate the con-
tent of the transmitted information, other users have devel-
oped an electronic “para-language” to mark-up their mes-
sage and convey affective and socio-emotional information.
Such informal language codes, called “emotext,” include
intentional misspelling (e.g., “u r ssoooo kooool”), lexi-
cal surrogates for vocalisations (e.g., “hmm”), grammatical
markers (e.g., excessive use of upper-case letters, repeated
question marks), and visual arrangements of text charac-
ters into “emoticons” (short combinations of normal and
rotated characters to resemble facial expressions of joy, sad-
ness etc.).
In this paper we are particularly interested in determin-
ing the gender of the author of an e-mail, based on the
gender-preferential language used by the author. The pa-
per is organised as follows. Firstly, we outline the current
status of work in the area of author attribution in Section 2.
We then focus our discussion on gender-preferential e-mail
mediated communication in Section 3. Sections 4 and 5
brieﬂy outline the Support Vector Machine learning algo-
rithm used in our experiments, describe the e-mail corpus
used, and present the methodology employed in the experi-
ments. Validation of the method is then undertaken by pre-
senting results of gender-based e-mail categorisation perfor-
mance in Section 6. Finally, we conclude with some gen-

2. Background to Author Attribution
The principal objectives of author gender attribution are
to classify an ensemble of e-mails as belonging to a par-
ticular author gender and, if possible, obtain a set of char-
acteristics or features that remain relatively constant for a
large number of e-mails written by that gender cohort of
authors. The question then arises; can characteristics such
as language, structure, layout etc. of an e-mail be used,
with a high degree of conﬁdence, as a kind of author cohort
phrenology and thus link the e-mail document with its au-
thor cohort? Also, can we expect the writing characteristics
or style of an author cohort to evolve in time and change in
different contexts? For example, the composition of formal
e-mails will differ from informal ones (changes in vocab-
ulary etc.). Even in the context of informal e-mails there
could be several composition styles (e.g., one style for per-
sonal relations and one for work relations). However, hu-
mans are creatures of habit and have certain personal traits
which tend to persist. All humans have unique (or near-
unique) patterns of behaviour, biometric attributes, and so
on. We therefore conjecture that certain characteristics per-
taining to language, composition and writing, such as par-
ticular syntactic and structural layout traits, patterns of vo-
cabulary usage, unusual language usage (e.g., converting
the letter “f” to “ph”, or the excessive use of digits and/or
upper-case letters), stylistic and sub-stylistic features will
remain relatively constant. The identiﬁcation and learning
of these characteristics with a sufﬁciently high accuracy are
the principal challenges in author cohort categorisation.
Related, but separate, areas of author cohort attribution
are text categorisation and authorship attribution. The for-
mer attempts to categorise a set of text documents based
on its contents or topic whilst the latter attempts to iden-
tify the author of the e-mail. Many methods have been pro-
posed for text categorisation. Most of these techniques em-
ploy the “bag–of–words” or word vector space feature rep-
resentation and use a learning algorithm such as decision
trees [1], Bayesian probabilistic approaches [2], or support
vector machines [3] to classify the text document. Work in
e-mail text classiﬁcation has also been undertaken by some
researchers in the context of automated e-mail document
ﬁltering and ﬁling (see, for example. [4]). Authorship at-
tribution studies are also extensive and often controversial
(for example, the authorship of the Federalist papers [5] and
Shakespeare’s works [6]). Almost all of these studies em-
ploy stylometric features (“style markers”) for discriminat-
ing authors and all use large, formal texts as the source of
documents. Over 1,000 stylometric features have been pro-
posed [7], including word- or character-based stylometric
features, function words, profanities, punctuation etc. Also,
there exists a number of different techniques for perform-
ing the discrimination. These include statistical approaches
(e.g., cusum [8], neural networks [9] and so on. Unfortu-
nately, there does not exist a consensus on the existence of
a set of uniquely discriminatory stylometric features, nor on
a correct methodology as many of the mentioned techniques
suffer from problems such as questionable analysis, incon-
sistencies for the same set of authors, failed replication etc.
A small number of studies in e-mail authorship attribu-
tion have been undertaken. Corney et al [10] used a set
of stylometric and e-mail structural features and also stud-
ied the effect of text size and the number of e-mail docu-
ments per author on the author categorisation performance.
They observed a relatively constant categorisation perfor-
mance for text chunk sizes greater than approximately 100
words with, however, a signiﬁcant drop-off for text sizes
less than this. Also, they observed that as few as 20 docu-
ments may be sufﬁcient for satisfactory categorisation per-
formance. de Vel et al achieved satisfactory results with
multi-topic and multi-author categorisation using a set of
predominantly content-free e-mail document features such
as structural characteristics and linguistic patterns [11].
3. Gender-Preferential E-mail Mediated Com-
munication
Although computer-mediated communication (CMC)
does inhibit some cues such as personal identity or individ-
uating details (e.g., dress, location, demeanour, expressive-
ness), there is no evidence to suggest that all other cues are
also inhibited. With e-mail mediated communication, some
information about social categories or social identity, such
as gender, or educational or ﬁrst language background cues
are likely to be inferred in the relative absence of interper-
sonal context cues [12].
Men and women use language and converse differently
even though they technically speak the same language.
Empirical evidence suggests that there exist gender differ-
ences in written communication, face-to-face interaction
and in computer-mediated communication.
It is thought
that gender-preferential language is conveyed in all of these
forms of communication due, in part, to the use of intersect-
ing or generalised gender-preferential language attributes.
Many studies have been undertaken on the issue of gen-
der and language use (for example, see the bibliography
at [13]). It has been suggested by various researchers that
women’s language makes more frequent use of emotionally
intensive adverbs and adjectives such as “so”, “terribly”,
“awfully”, “dreadful” and “quite” and that their language
is more punctuated with attenuated assertions, apologies,
questions, personal orientation and support”. On the other
hand, male conversational patterns express “independence”

and assertions of vertically hierarchical power. Men are
more “proactive” by directing speech at solving problems
while women are more “reactive” to the contributions of
others, agreeing, understanding and supporting. Some fea-
tures of men’s language are “strong assertions, aggressive,
self-promotion, rhetorical questions, authoritative orienta-
tion, challenges and humor”. In brief, men’s on-line con-
versation resemble “report talk”, rather than “rapport talk”
which women tend to favour.
Many gender-preferential CMC studies have been under-
taken in recent years. However, very few studies in the area
of e-mail CMC have been performed (for example, Thom-
son et al [12]) and no studies, to the authors’ knowledge,
in automated e-mail gender-preferential author cohort at-
tribution have been undertaken to date.
In our study we
use a combination of stylometric, structural and gender-
preferential features, together with a Support Vector Ma-
chine classiﬁer as the learning algorithm.
4. Support Vector Machine Classiﬁer
The Support Vector Machine’s (SVM) concept is based
on the idea of structural risk minimisation which minimises
the generalisation error (i.e. true error on unseen examples).
This true error is bounded by the sum of the training set er-
ror and a term which depends on the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC) dimension of the classiﬁer and on the number of train-
ing examples. SVMs belong to the class of the more general
basis expansion and regularisation problem to which meth-
ods such as smoothing splines, multidimensional splines
(eg, MARS, wavelet smoothing) belong. One advantage of
SVMs is that they do not require a reduction in the num-
ber of features in order to avoid the problem of over-ﬁtting,
which is useful when dealing with large dimensions as en-
countered in the area of text mining. See [14] for more
background information on SVMs.
Some researchers have applied SVMs to the problem
of text document categorisation and author attribution con-
cluding that, in most cases, SVMs outperform conventional
classiﬁers (see, for example, [3]). SVMs have been used for
automatic ﬁling of e-mails as well as for classifying e-mail
text as spam or non-spam [15][16].
5. E-mail Corpus and Methodology
We describe the process of generating the e-mail corpus
and the selection of attributes for the gender-preferential
language author categorisation experiment. We also brieﬂy
describe the sampling methodology used and calculation of
the categorisation performance.
5.1. E-mail Corpus Generation
The generation of a suitable corpus of e-mails for the
study was complicated by various factors. Firstly, the pro-
cess of generating any e-mail corpus is constrained by pri-
vacy issues and ethical considerations. It is not possible to
use e-mails from other people’s inboxes without their con-
sent. Unfortunately, obtaining a person’s consent is an al-
most impossible exercise. Secondly, even though it is possi-
ble to use publicly available e-mail corpuses such as news-
groups, mailing lists etc., it is not always easy to validate
the gender of the sender of each e-mail in the corpus. For
example, it is not sufﬁcient to use the sender’s name as this
could be an alias, indeterminate, spoofed etc.. Thirdly, it is
generally difﬁcult to obtain a sufﬁciently large and “clean”
(i.e., void of cross-postings, off-the-topic spam, empty bod-
ied e-mails with attachments etc.) corpus of e-mails. Fi-
nally, it is important not to generate an e-mail corpus that
is biased towards, for example, a particular cohort (e.g.,
author’s language style) or e-mail topic as these may af-
fect the categorisation results of the gender-preferential lan-
guage author attribution experiment. A judicious, and time-
consuming, selection of e-mails for model building is there-
