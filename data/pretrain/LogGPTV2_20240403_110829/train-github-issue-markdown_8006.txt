Deno claims to be a "secure runtime for JavaScript and TYPESCRIPT", and it is
one of the main reasons why I started looking into Deno.
And yet, a simple test on `deno repl` shows that the typescript is not really
supported. Is this by design? Is this Deno's technical limitations?
For me, personally, being able to transpile Typescript to Javascript has
relatively low value. Whether I compile the code via tsc or deno (with
embedded tsc), or any other tools, has very little difference. It's just a
build process.
The real value for me (if Deno supports Typescript as a first class citizen,
as it seems to promise) will be being able to "hide" the transpilation process
from the user experience, like in REPL.
