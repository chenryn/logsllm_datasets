Deno positions itself as a "secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript," which was one of the primary reasons I became interested in exploring it. However, a simple test using `deno repl` revealed that TypeScript support is not fully integrated. This raises questions: Is this intentional, or is it due to technical limitations within Deno?

For me, the ability to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript holds relatively little value. Whether I use `tsc`, Deno (which includes an embedded `tsc`), or any other tool, the process is essentially the sameâ€”it's just part of the build process.

The real value, in my view, would come from Deno treating TypeScript as a first-class citizen, as it claims to do. This would mean seamlessly integrating the transpilation process into the user experience, such as in the REPL, so that users don't have to manage it manually.
