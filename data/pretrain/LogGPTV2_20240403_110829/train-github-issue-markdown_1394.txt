Hello everybody,
I have a little issue with the modal component.
When I open a modal, the button close (with data-dismiss attribute) works and
close it. But if I reopen the same one, it's over, it doesn't work anymore.
The only way to close the modal is to click outside of it or to press ESC.
Any idea ? (I'm a PHP developper with only few basics in JS)
Thanks
Robin
