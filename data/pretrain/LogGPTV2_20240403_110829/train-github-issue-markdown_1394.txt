Subject: Issue with Reopening Modal Component

Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently facing a minor issue with the modal component in my project.

Upon opening the modal, the close button (which has the `data-dismiss` attribute) functions correctly and closes the modal as expected. However, when I attempt to reopen the same modal, the close button no longer works. The only ways to close the modal at this point are by clicking outside of it or pressing the ESC key.

I am primarily a PHP developer with only basic knowledge of JavaScript, so any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,  
Robin
