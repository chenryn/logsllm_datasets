### Issue description
`ConsistentHashLoadBalance` is very good at guaranteeing a robust data
locality, when the same method with the same parameter is directed to always
the same target (when system state does not change).  
However, it is possible in reality when there exists a hot parameter, which is
called significantly more frequently with the given method compared to other
parameters.  
This lead to a unbalanced load as the request to this method with the **hot**
parameter is always directed to the same target, makes this target overloaded.
### Expectation
Would it be possible to improve the current `ConsistentHashLoadBalance`
implementation to better balance the load under this edge case?
