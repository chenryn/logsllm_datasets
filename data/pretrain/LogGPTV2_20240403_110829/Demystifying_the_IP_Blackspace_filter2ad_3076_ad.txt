### Correlation with SpamTracer

Finally, we correlated the list of blackspace IP prefixes with the output of SpamTracer [22], a system specifically designed to identify network IP address ranges that are hijacked by spammers to enable them to send spam while remaining hidden. Relying on a combination of BGP and traceroute data collected for networks seen originating spam and a set of specifically tailored heuristics, the system identifies those spam networks that exhibit routing behavior likely indicating they were hijacked. We found that 82 IP prefixes were reported by SpamTracer as hijacked spam networks at the same time we identified them as being part of the blackspace.

### Case Study

Starting from the 82 particularly suspicious blackspace prefixes, we uncovered a very interesting phenomenon described in detail below. A close examination of how these 82 network prefixes were announced in BGP revealed that they were all advertised via one AS: AS59790, "H3S Helge Sczepanek trading as H3S medien services." Based on this intriguing observation, we decided to extract from all identified blackspace IP prefixes those that were advertised via AS59790. Surprisingly, we discovered that a total of 476 IP prefixes (including the 82 seen originating spam by SpamTracer) were advertised via AS59790 between October 17, 2014, and January 8, 2015, and all of them were part of the blackspace at the time of the BGP announcements. Furthermore, all blackspace prefixes correspond to IP address space allocated by the IANA to AfriNIC (the African RIR) but not yet allocated or assigned by AfriNIC to any organization.

Examining the AS paths in the BGP announcements of the 476 networks, we found two common patterns:
1. {AScollector, ..., AS174, AS59790}
2. {AScollector, ..., AS174, AS59790, AS201509}

These patterns reveal that AS59790 was always connected to a single upstream provider, AS174 "Cogent Communications (US)," a cross-continent tier-1 ISP. From the AS paths, it is also evident that when AS59790 did not appear as the BGP origin AS (case 1), it was apparently used to provide transit to AS201509 (case 2). AS59790 "H3S Helge Sczepanek trading as H3S medien services (DE)" was assigned on September 30, 2014, and AS201509 "Sky Capital Investments Ltd. (DE)" was assigned on October 17, 2014, shortly before they started to be used to announce the blackspace prefixes. Both ASes were registered in the RIPE region to what appear to be organizations active in the finance industry in Germany. However, extensive web searches did not yield any information about these organizations. The description of AS59790 and AS201509 in the IRR reveals that they are under the control of the same person. Attempts to contact RIPE for further information were unsuccessful.

In summary:
- AS59790 and AS201509 were used to announce a total of 476 blackspace prefixes over a period of approximately three weeks.
- These ASes were never used to announce any non-blackspace prefixes.
- Some of the blackspace prefixes announced were used to send spam, according to [22].

The evidence presented here suggests that these ASes were involved in malicious BGP announcements of IP blackspace. Moreover, a recent article from Dyn [6] reported similar evidence about AS59790 being involved in fraudulent routing announcements of unallocated African IP address space. This case study confirms the assumption that blackspace IP prefixes are purposefully used to source different types of malicious network traffic, such as spam, likely in an effort to hinder traceability.

### Discussion

In this section, we address the shortcomings and weaknesses of our methodology.

#### Data Granularity

The results presented in Section 3 offer a granularity of one day. This can be explained by the following reasons:
1. The data sources we use to compute the blackspace—i.e., the IRR databases and the RIR delegated files—are only updated once per day.
2. Our active probing of the blackspace networks is limited by the capacity of our Internet connection. To run the scan in its entirety (i.e., the equivalent /10 blackspace on 7 ports, with additional web crawling), we need, on average, 17 hours. As a result, we cannot perform more than a single scan per day.
3. Consequently, we use routing table dumps from RIPE RIS instead of BGP messages. Routing table dumps are generated every 8 hours and contain the entirety of the routes known by the router. BGP message dumps, which are generated every 5 minutes and contain all the BGP messages exchanged between the collector routers and one of its peers, would provide better granularity. However, since we were focusing on the accurate detection of blackspace prefixes and the discovery of the network footprints and malicious activities, we believe our results are still representative. Short-lived hijacks occurring in the blackspace would not enable an attacker to host a scam website, for example.

#### Probing Environment

Our probing is done from a single machine located in AS3215 (Orange). While this gives us plenty of control over the environment in which our experiment is deployed, it comes with some drawbacks. First, we do not know anything regarding the BGP view of the network we are connected to. In other words, we use BGP data from RIPE RIS as the source of our control-plane data and the Orange network to explore connectivity. Even though Orange is a tier-1 network, we could not find any direct peering between 'our' AS and a RIPE collector. AS3215 is routed through AS5511, better known as OpenTransit, which contains Orange's tier-1 infrastructure. This potentially leads to false negatives in our measurements, especially for low-visibility prefixes, such as the route leak of 192.0.0.0/2, where we detected malicious IP addresses (Section 3.3.C). Probes sent from our vantage point might not reach the originating network, or they might be dropped due to a lack of "route to host." The optimal way to carry out these measurements is from a machine that runs BGP to assess the reachability of the destination.

#### BGP Events and Route Leaks

At the beginning of Section 3, we observed two BGP events leading to a sudden and massive increase in the blackspace size. We classified these events as route leaks because they were only seen by a handful of RIPE collectors—three collectors for the leak in October and one collector for the one in January—and because there was only a single AS path between the collector(s) and the origin. However, because we also detected malicious activities within them, the question of whether these events were deliberate attacks disguised as route leaks needs to be raised. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a definitive answer. A recent report highlighted highly localized BGP hijacks engineered to have a very low footprint and remain invisible from the perspective of route collectors [20].

### Related Work

The oldest report of malicious activities carried out from the bogon address space dates back to 2001 with [19], where the author provided an analysis of the attacks carried out against an active website. A large proportion of attacks originated from bogon addresses: 13% from within the bogons of classes A, B, and C; 53% from classes D (multicast) and E (future use). By properly filtering incoming traffic at a border router, 66% of attacks could easily be mitigated. As a result, Team Cymru set up the bogon reference project [18], which precisely defines the different categories of bogon prefixes. We used this as the basis of our definitions in Section 2. Additionally, multiple lists of bogon prefixes are offered to network owners who wish to filter bogons out of their networks. These lists vary according to the desired level of precision and are dynamic, requiring network operators to update their filters accordingly. The full bogon list includes preﬁxes reserved by RFCs for specific use cases and preﬁxes that have been allocated to RIRs by the IANA but not by RIRs to ISPs or end users. By comparing the full bogon list with our blackspace list, we identified key differences. First, the full bogon list does not make use of the IRRs, as evidenced by many preﬁxes for which an inetnum object could be found. Second, the full bogon list appears to implement some heuristics based on the status of the preﬁxes. For example, preﬁxes whose status transitioned from either allocated or assigned to reserved were not listed in the full bogon list. We ignore the motivations behind these heuristics. However, the comparison of our blackspace list with the full bogon list on the same day shows that using the IRR databases in addition to the RIR delegation files improves the accuracy of the list.

In 2004, Feamster et al. [8] provided the first formal study of bogon prefixes by looking into the prevalence and persistence of bogon announcements, as well as the origin ASes leaking these preﬁxes. However, the authors did not explicitly focus on the blackspace, but rather on the equivalent of the (simple) bogon list. Consequently, 70% of the analyzed events involved the preﬁxes reserved for the private IP space. Only 40% of the events lasted longer than a day. In our analysis, this value is 75% (Figure 3). The rest of the study cannot be directly mapped onto our results, even though the beginning of Section 3 provides results to similar questions. With the authors’ methodology, there is a one-to-one mapping between the BGP routing table and the bogon analysis. With this, they can focus on the number of bogon preﬁxes announced by an AS. In our case, we have a one-to-n relationship between the BGP prefix and the blackspace prefixes because we divide the BGP announcement into separate parts that may have been assigned independently. The authors also focus on the effect of bogon filtering and show that network operators who filter out bogon preﬁxes usually do not update their filters in a timely fashion, resulting in reachability issues and potential denial of service. It is also worth noting that the bogon preﬁxes used for the study were composed of the 78 /8 preﬁxes that still belonged to the IANA pool back then (excluding class E). Today, the IANA pool only consists of one single /8 preﬁx, 0.0.0.0/8 (also excluding 240.0.0.0/4). As a result, the IP address space inside which our studies have been conducted is much different.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we focused on the IP blackspace, which is composed of the set of prefixes that are globally announced through BGP but have not been assigned for use to any entity. We presented a thorough methodology to compute the blackspace by using a combination of data sources reflecting the current allocations of the IP space. We found that the daily blackspace address space is equivalent to a /10 prefix, and that the prefixes that compose it change over time. We actively studied these networks from both the BGP control plane and the data plane perspectives. While we showed that some of the blackspace is composed of prefixes that are either being phased out of the Internet or being installed, a significant part of it does not result from normal network operations, such as assignments and decommissions. By cross-checking with various reliable security data sources, we were able to isolate malicious activities that occurred only during periods when the monitored prefixes were inside the blackspace. Even by using our strict matching rules and our limited, targeted view of these networks, the amount of malicious activities is significant. In particular, we showed through a validated case study that cybercriminals do abuse blackspace prefixes to carry out nefarious activities while also hindering their traceability.

Consequently, this paper confirms the importance of precisely filtering blackspace prefixes out of BGP. Because state-of-the-art hijacking detection tools (such as Argus [16]) do not focus on detecting this particular form of hijack, filtering out routes to the blackspace is the only active counter-measure that can be used today against blackspace hijacks. However, the shape of the blackspace is dynamic, and previous studies [4, 8] have illustrated that, when a bogon filter has been set up, it often becomes obsolete because it is not updated, thereby affecting the connectivity towards networks that are being added to the Internet. Moreover, the current source of bogon filtering [18] does not take into account inetnum entries from IRR databases, thus including—and preventing access to—networks that have been assigned to a customer.

This paper also underlines the difficulty of using a ground truth in BGP. Even though the prefixes we focused on should not be used on the public Internet, we were able to show cases where their use was the result of legitimate practices. As a result, it is still quite difficult to automate the estimation of the danger resulting from a particular prefix in the blackspace.

We plan to improve our system in the following ways:
1. Define a set of reliable heuristics that would discard benign blackspace announcements and retain only those that are potentially harmful, thus increasing the quality of filters installed on routers.
2. Supplement our probing system with a traceroute infrastructure to geographically locate the origin of these networks and the diversity of their connectivity. This would help us identify specific parts of the networks that hijackers prefer to abuse.
3. View the BGP control plane and the data plane from the same vantage point to ensure we reach low-visibility routes. For this, we need a set of geographically diversified machines that run BGP, each connected to a different set of peers, and from which we can run our measurement experiments. If this can be achieved, a bonus would be to make the system run in real time by detecting and probing networks as they come and go in the BGP routing table.
4. Extend our results to the IPv6 address space, where the unallocated space is getting smaller every day. It would be interesting to see how the results compare.

We are able to provide interested parties with more detailed results and to discuss future work that can be undertaken with this dataset and infrastructure.
