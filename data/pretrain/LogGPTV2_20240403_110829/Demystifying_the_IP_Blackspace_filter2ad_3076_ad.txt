Finally, we correlated the list of blackspace IP preﬁxes with the output of
SpamTracer [22], a system speciﬁcally designed to identify network IP address
ranges that are hijacked by spammers to enable them to send spam while remain-
ing hidden. Relying on a combination of BGP and traceroute data collected for
networks seen originating spam and a set of speciﬁcally tailored heuristics, the
system identiﬁes those spam networks that exhibit a routing behavior likely
indicating they were hijacked. We found that 82 IP preﬁxes were reported by
SpamTracer as hijacked spam networks at the same time we identiﬁed them
as being part of the blackspace.
E. Case Study. Starting from the 82 particularly suspicious blackspace preﬁxes
we uncovered a very interesting phenomenon that we describe in-depth here
below. Looking closely at how these 82 network preﬁxes were announced in
BGP revealed that they were all advertised via one AS: AS59790 “H3S Helge
Sczepanek trading as H3S medien services”. Based on this intriguing observation,
we decided to extract from all identiﬁed blackspace IP preﬁxes every of those

that were advertised via AS59790. Surprisingly we discovered that no less than
476 IP preﬁxes in total (82 of them seen originating spam by SpamTracer)
were advertised via AS59790 between October 17, 2014 and January 8, 2015
and that all of them were part of the blackspace at the time of the BGP
announcements. Furthermore, all blackspace preﬁxes actually correspond to IP
address space allocated by the IANA to AfriNIC (the African RIR) but not yet
allocated or assigned by AfriNIC to any organization. Looking at the AS
paths in the BGP announcements of the 476 networks
{AScollector, . . . , AS174, AS59790}
{AScollector, . . . , AS174, AS59790, AS201509}
(1)
(2)
reveals that AS59790 was always connected to a single upstream provider AS174
“Cogent Communications (US)”, a cross-continent tier-1 ISP. From the AS paths
we can also see that when AS59790 did not appear as the BGP origin AS (case
1) it was apparently used to provide transit to AS201509 (case 2). AS59790
“H3S Helge Sczepanek trading as H3S medien services (DE)” was assigned
on September 30, 2014 and AS201509 “Sky Capital Investments Ltd. (DE)”
was assigned on October 17, 2014, shortly before they started to be used to
announce the blackspace preﬁxes. Both ASes were registered in the RIPE region
to what appear to be organizations active in the ﬁnance industry in Germany.
However, we were unable to ﬁnd any information regarding these organizations
through extensive web searches. The description of AS59790 and AS201509 in
the IRR reveals that they are in fact under the control of the same person. We
were unable to establish contact or to get any further information by contacting
RIPE.
In summary,
– AS59790 and AS201509 were used to announce a total of 476 blackspace
preﬁxes over a period of approximately three weeks;
– these ASes were never used to announced any non-blackspace preﬁx;
– some of the blackspace preﬁxes announced were used to send spam, according
to [22].
The evidence presented here above suggests that these ASes were involved in
malicious BGP announcements of IP blackspace. Moreover, a recent article from
Dyn [6] reported on similar evidence about AS59790 being involved in fraudulent
routing announcements of unallocated African IP address space. This case study
thus tends to conﬁrm the assumption that blackspace IP preﬁxes are purposefully
used to source diﬀerent types of malicious network traﬃc, such as spam, likely
in an eﬀort to hinder traceability.
4 Discussion
In this Section, we address the shortcomings and weaknesses of our methodology.
128
Q. Jacquemart et al.
The results presented in Sect. 3 oﬀer a granularity of one day. This can
be explained by the following reasons. First, the data sources that we use to
compute the blackspace – i.e. the IRR databases and the RIR delegated ﬁles
– are only updated once per day. Second, because we are actively probing the
blackspace networks, we are eﬀectively limited by the capacity of our Internet
connection. In order to comfortably run this scan in its entirety (i.e. the equiv-
alent /10 blackspace on 7 ports, with the additional web crawling), we need, on
average, 17 h. As a result, we cannot do more than a single scan per day. Third,
and consequently, we use routing table dumps from RIPE RIS instead of BGP
messages. Routing table dumps are generated every 8 h and contain the entirety
of the routes known by the router. The dumps of BGP messages are generated
every 5 min and contain all the BGP messages exchanged between the collector
routers and one of its peers. With those, we would obtain a much better gran-
ularity of data, maybe even include more preﬁxes in the blackspace. However,
since we were mainly focusing on the accurate detection of blackspace preﬁxes,
and on the discovery of the network footprints that they have, as well as the
malicious activities they carry out, we think our results are still representative.
Short-lived hijacks occurring in the blackspace would not enable an attacker to
host a scam website, for example.
Our probing is done from a single machine located in AS3215 (Orange). While
this gives us plenty of control over the environment in which our experiment is
deployed, it comes at the price of a few drawbacks. First, we don’t know anything
regarding the BGP-view of the network we are connected in. In other words, we
are using BGP data from RIPE RIS as the source of our control-plane data, and
the Orange network in order to explore the connectivity. Even though Orange
is a tier-1 network, we could not ﬁnd any direct peering between ‘our’ AS and
a RIPE collector. Actually, AS3215 is routed through AS5511 – better known
as OpenTransit – which contains Orange’s tier-1 infrastructure. This potentially
leads to false negative in our measurements, especially in the case low-visibility
preﬁxes, such as the route leak of 192.0.0.0/2 in which we detected malicious IP
addresses (Sect. 3.3.C). Would probes sent from our vantage point have reached
the originating network, or would they have been dropped because there would
be no “route to host”? The optimal way to carry out these measurements is from
a machine that runs BGP so as to assess the reachability of the destination.
At the beginning of Sect. 3, we saw two BGP events leading to a sudden and
massive increase of the blackspace size. We classiﬁed these events as route leaks
because they were only seen by a handful of RIPE collectors – three collectors
for the leak in October; one collector for the one in January – and because there
was only a single AS path between the collector(s) and the origin. However,
because we also detected malicious activities inside of them, the question of
whether these events were deliberate attacks disguised as route leaks needs to
be raised. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a deﬁnite answer. But a recent
report underlined highly localised BGP hijacks, engineered to have a very low
footprint, and to remain invisible from the point of views of route collectors [20].

Demystifying the IP Blackspace
129
The oldest report of malicious activities carried out from the bogon address space
dates back to 2001 with [19], where the author provided an analysis of the attacks
carried out against an active web site. A large proportion of attacks originated
from bogon addresses: 13 % from within the bogons of classes A, B, and C; 53 %
from classes D (multicast) and E (future use). All in all, by properly ﬁltering
incoming traﬃc at a border router, 66 % of attacks could easily be mitigated.
As a result, Team Cymru set up the bogon reference project [18], which
precisely deﬁnes the diﬀerent categories of bogon preﬁxes. We used this as the
basis of our deﬁnitions in Sect. 2. Additionally, multiple lists of bogon preﬁxes
are oﬀered to network owners who wish to ﬁlter bogons out of their networks,
which can be retrieved in many convenient ways and formats. These lists vary
according to the desired level of precision. The bogon lists contain the preﬁxes
still reserved in the IANA pool, as well as preﬁxes reserved by RFCs for speciﬁc
use cases. The full bogon list supplements these preﬁxes with preﬁxes that have
been allocated to RIRs by the IANA, but not by RIRs to ISPs or end users.
These lists are dynamic, and network operators that use them should update
their ﬁlters accordingly. Unfortunately, the methodology used to populate these
lists is not disclosed. By comparing the full bogon list with our blackspace list, we
were able to identify key diﬀerences. First, the full bogon list does not make use
of the IRRs, as evidenced by many preﬁxes for which an inetnum object could
be found. Second, the full bogon list appears to implement some heuristics based
on the status of the preﬁxes. For example, we noticed that preﬁxes whose status
transitioned from either allocated or assigned to reserved were not listed
in the full bogon list. We also noticed that some preﬁxes that were reserved for
a long time were not listed, although it might be that the transition happened
before our data was gathered. We ignore the motivations behind these heuristics.
However, the comparison of our blackspace list with the full bogon list on the
same day shows that using the IRR databases in addition to the RIR delegation
ﬁles improves the accuracy of the list.
In 2004, Feamster et al. [8] provided the ﬁrst formal study of bogon preﬁxes
by looking into the prevalence and persistence of bogon announcements, as well
as the origin ASes leaking these preﬁxes. However, the authors did not explicitly
focus on the blackspace, but rather on the equivalent of the (simple) bogon list.
Consequently, 70 % of the analyzed events actually involve the preﬁxes reserved
for the private IP space. Only 40 % of the events lasted longer than a day. In our
analysis, this value is of 75 % (Fig. 3). The rest of the study cannot be directly
mapped onto our results, even though the beginning of Sect. 3 provides results
to similar questions. However, with the authors’ methodology, there is a one-to-
one mapping between the BGP routing table and the bogon analysis. With this,
they can focus on the number of bogon preﬁxes announced by an AS. In our
case, we have a one-to-n relationship between the BGP preﬁx and the blackspace
preﬁxes because we divide the BGP announcement in separate parts that may
have been assigned independently. The authors also focus on the eﬀect of bogon
ﬁltering and show that network operators who ﬁlter out bogon preﬁxes usually
130
Q. Jacquemart et al.
do not update their ﬁlters in timely fashion, resulting in reachability issues and
potential denial of service. It is also worth noting that the bogon preﬁxes used
for the study were composed of the 78 /8 preﬁxes that still belonged to the
IANA pool back then (excluding class E). Today, the IANA pool only consists
of one single /8 preﬁx, 0.0.0.0/8 (also excluding 240.0.0.0/4). As a result, the IP
address space inside which our studies have been conducted is much diﬀerent.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we focused on the IP blackspace, which is composed of the set of
preﬁxes that are globally announced through BGP but have not been assigned
for use to any entity. We presented a thorough methodology to compute the
blackspace by using a combination of data sources reﬂecting the current alloca-
tions of the IP space. We saw that the daily blackspace address space is equiv-
alent to a /10 preﬁx, and that the preﬁxes that compose it change over time.
We actively studied those networks from the BGP control plane point of view,
and also from the data plane point of view. While we showed that some of the
blackspace is composed of preﬁxes that are either being phased out of the Inter-
net or being installed, a signiﬁcant part of it does not result from normal network
operations, such as assignments and decommissions. By cross-checking with var-
ious reliable security data sources, we were able to isolate malicious activities
that only occurred during a period in which the monitored preﬁxes were inside
the blackspace. Even by using our strict matching rules, and our limited, tar-
geted view of these networks, the amount of malicious activities is signiﬁcant.
In particular, we showed through a validated case study that cybercriminals do
abuse blackspace preﬁxes to carry out nefarious activities while also hindering
their traceability.
Consequently, this paper conﬁrms how important it is to precisely ﬁlter
blackspace preﬁxes out of BGP. Because state-of-the-art hijacking detection tools
(such as Argus [16]) do not focus on detecting this particular form of hijack, ﬁl-
tering out routes to the blackspace is the only active counter-measure that can
be used today against blackspace hijacks. However, the shape of the blackspace
is dynamic, and previous studies [4,8] have illustrated that, when a bogon ﬁlter
has been setup, it is obsolete because it is not updated, thereby aﬀecting the con-
nectivity towards networks that are being added to the Internet. Moreover, the
current source of bogon ﬁltering [18] does not take into account inetnum entries
from IRR databases, thus including – and preventing access to – networks that
have been assigned to a customer.
This paper also underlines the diﬃculty of using a ground truth in BGP.
Even though the preﬁxes that we focused on all have in common the fact that
they should not even be used on the public Internet, we were able to show cases
where their use was the result of legitimate practices. As a result it is still quite
diﬃcult to automate the estimation of the danger resulting from a particular
preﬁx in the blackspace.
Demystifying the IP Blackspace
131
We plan to improve on our system in the following ways. First, we plan to
deﬁne a set of reliable heuristics that would discard benign blackspace announce-
ments and only retain those that are potentially harmful, thus increasing the
quality of ﬁlters installed on routers. Second, we would like to supplement our
probing system with a traceroute infrastructure that would enable us to geo-
graphically locate the origin of these networks, and the diversity of their con-
nectivity. This would enable us to see if there are speciﬁc parts of the networks
that hijackers prefer to abuse. Third, we need to view the BGP control plane,
as well as the data plane from the same vantage point in order to make sure we
reach low visibility routes. For this, we need a set of geographically diversiﬁed
machines that run BGP – each connected to a diﬀerent set of peers – and from
which we can run our measurement experiments. If this can be achieved, a bonus
point would be to make the system run in real time, by detecting and probing
networks as they come and go in the BGP routing table. Our results currently
focus on the IPv4 address space, inside of which the unallocated space is getting
smaller every day. It would be interesting to do the same measurements with
IPv6, and see how the results compare. As a ﬁnal remark, note that we are able
to provide interested parties with more detailed results and to discuss future
work that can be undertaken with this dataset and infrastructure.
