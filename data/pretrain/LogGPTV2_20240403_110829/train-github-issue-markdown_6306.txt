I originally reported this against a downstream project: hailocab/react-pure#2
I think it's terrific that Babel doesn't just dump the entire external helpers
file everywhere, or requires the whole thing to be used by every project,
because that's effectively what traceur ends up doing and for small projects
it ends up being quite bloated.
However, I've noticed that a small set of helpers is being duplicated across
every file in the aforementioned project. I've read about helpers here:  
https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/external-helpers/
There doesn't seem to actually be a way to disable the helpers. The default
behaviour seems to be:
    babel --external-helpers
and the following doesn't change the behaviour:
    babel --no-external-helpers
Is there a way to have Babel output a deduplicated centralised module (or
modules) for the tailored set of helpers, and automatically have `require()`
statements injected into the output where the duplicated content used to be?
