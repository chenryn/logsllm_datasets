We need ability to pass custom config information at runtime to the browser,
in the same fashion next.js passes `assetPrefix` from `next.config.js`.
  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
Ability to add custom information (like graphql endpoint) to `next.config.js`,
something like:
    module.exports = {
      assetPrefix: process.env.CDN_PREFIX,
      config: {
        graphql: {
          uri: process.env.GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT
        },
        myCustomThing: '2345678',
        myCustomList: [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
      }
    };
and a way to consume it in the app running in the browser, like:
    const { config } = __NEXT_DATA__
## Current Behavior
Nothing happens
## Context
We're building immutable images that later deployed to the different
environments, so there is no way for us to mutate the code and bake in API
endpoints, we need this feature to provide API endpoints via environment
variables at runtime.
Thank you.
