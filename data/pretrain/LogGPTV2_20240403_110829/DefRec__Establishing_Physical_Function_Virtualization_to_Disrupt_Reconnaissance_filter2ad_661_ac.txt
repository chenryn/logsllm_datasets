Security Argument. Following the assumption that there
are n real devices and m2 inaccessible virtual nodes, we
present a brief security argument here and leave the detailed
derivation and evaluation to Appendix A.
When an adversary ﬁnds that her compromised identity
is isolated from the network after a probing, she can guess
on which previous access (among up to δ + 1 accesses) she
probed an inaccessible virtual node. We want to make each
previous access have an equal chance of leading to the isolation
of the suspicious identity. In other words, we want to make
p0 = Q0 = Q1 = ··· = Qδ. Then pk = p0/(1 − k · p0)
for 0 ≤ k ≤ δ. To make pk  p0 always holds, which is
equivalent
the
probability that an adversary has accessed δ real devices is
Sδ = pδ
0
remaining real devices under this protocol, the probability
that they can obtain all real measurements through proactive
probing will be at least Sall = S
δ
(cid:1)−1. If the adversary accesses all
to p0  τ, state
estimation declares the presence of bad data and raises an alert.
2) Attack Preparation: In FDIAs, adversaries’ objective is
to compromise measurements z so that the estimated state
variable ˆx becomes a different value ˆxa = ˆx + c, which is
“further” away from the actual state by c, without triggering
alerts in state estimation [35], [42].
To make FDIAs successful, adversaries can inject an attack
vector a into the original measurement z. With the full knowl-
edge of H, adversaries can construct a such that a = Hc
and determine the corresponding compromised measurements

This is because physical components associated with rows in
H1 are not affected by decoy data xd. In H2, we ﬁrst append
two rows (i.e., rows 6 and 7 of H(cid:48)) corresponding to virtual
Bus 4 and virtual transmission line (3, 4). Because of this
virtual line, the rows associated with Bus 3 and Bus 4 in matrix
H(cid:48)
2 is changed correspondingly, per formula (3). To see those
changes explicitly, we further divide H(cid:48)
2 into four sub-matrices,
i.e., H(cid:48)
23, and H(cid:48)
21 has
the same dimensions as H2.

How Adversaries Prepare FDIAs based on Decoy Data.
With an attack objective being c(cid:48), an adversary determines
an attack strategy a(cid:48) according to the condition a(cid:48) = H(cid:48)c(cid:48)
based on decoy matrix H(cid:48), where a(cid:48) = [aT aT
d ]T and c(cid:48) =
d ]T . Here, ad and cd are changes made on decoy data
[cT cT
zd and xd correspondingly.
How FDIAs Become Ineffective. When state estimation of
a power grid receives compromised measurements, it veriﬁes
the integrity of measurements using condition a = Hc, which
is different from the one (i.e., a(cid:48) = H(cid:48)c(cid:48)) used by adver-
saries to determine the compromised measurements. While
the adversary thinks she has designed a successful attack, the
involvement of decoy data makes it detectable even based on
existing state estimation.
Is it Possible for FDIAs to Bypass DefRec (False
Negative)? We used mathematical representations of attack
preparations of FDIAs to demonstrate that it is challenging, if
not impossible, for FDIAs to bypass DefRec.
In Equation (5), we expand the condition that adversaries
use to determine compromised measurements.

To avoid alerts from state estimation used in power grids,
FDIAs determined based on decoy data need to satisfy the
condition a = Hc. By putting Equation (5) into this condition,
we have:

Equation (6) indicates the necessary condition for adver-
saries to bypass DefRec, i.e., performing successful FDIAs
even with injections of decoy data. In practice, this corresponds
to one of the following two conditions, which are difﬁcult to
satisfy:
• Adversaries are forced to change their attack strategies,
to satisfy the condition H(cid:48)
22cd = H2c. Even adver-
saries are successful to satisfy the condition, forcing them to
change attack strategies can directly affect effectiveness and
stealthiness of the original attacks. As the scale of power
grids increases, dimensions of Equation 6 also increase,
making the condition difﬁcult to satisfy according to our
evaluation (see Section VII-A3).

as za = z + a. In that case, the L2-norm of the measurement
residual becomes:
||za − H ˆxa|| = ||z + a − H(ˆx + c)|| = ||z − H ˆx|| ≤ τ (4)
Because L2-norm of measurement residual of compro-
mised measurement za is less than τ, state estimation raises
no alerts on the compromised measurements.
3) Crafting Decoy Data to Mislead FDIAs: Because ad-
versaries rely on measurement matrix H to determine com-
promised measurements, we add virtual nodes to build a new
power grid with a different measurement matrix; the compro-
mised measurements determined based on this measurement
matrix (which is decoy data) would always raise alerts in state
estimation (see the following derivations).
Grid Conﬁgurations based on Virtual Nodes. When
adding virtual nodes into a power system, dimensions of state
variable x and sensor data z increase correspondingly. We rep-
resent new state variable and sensor data as the combination of
real data and decoy data (from virtual nodes): x(cid:48) = [xT xd
T ]T
T ]T , where (·)d represents decoy data.
and z(cid:48) = [zT zd
After decoy data is added, the measurement matrix also
changes from H to H(cid:48). We use Figure 6 to show the construc-
tion of H(cid:48). In this ﬁgure, we mark the value of susceptance of
each transmission line in a 3-bus system. We add two virtual
nodes: Bus 4 and a transmission line connecting it to Bus 3.
The decoy data of interest is B34, the susceptance of line (3,
4) (other decoy data, e.g., active line power and bus power
are not needed in this discussion). In the ﬁgure, we associate
each row of H and H(cid:48) with the corresponding line or bus (at
the end of that row), based on which entries in that row are
determined according to formulas (2) and (3).
To better understand the relationship between H and H(cid:48),
we divide H into two sub-matrices H1 and H2. Sub-matrix
H2 corresponds to real physical components that are affected
by decoy data, while H1 corresponds to real components that
are not. In the example shown in Figure 6, because we connect
virtual Bus 4 to real Bus 3, H2 includes a single row associated
with Bus 3.
After we add Bus 4 and line (3, 4), matrix H changes to
H(cid:48) as follows. Each row of H(cid:48)
1 is constructed by appending
an appropriate number of 0 at the end of each row in H1.
21 = H(cid:48)
• A power grid fails to deploy sufﬁcient sensors. If there are
no sensors deployed at the physical component associated
with H2 (e.g., Bus 3 whose sensor measurements are
affected by decoy data), we have H2 = H(cid:48)
22 = Φ,
which is an empty matrix. This is very unlikely to happen, as
modern power grids usually deploy many redundant sensors
to ensure accurate state estimation [45].
