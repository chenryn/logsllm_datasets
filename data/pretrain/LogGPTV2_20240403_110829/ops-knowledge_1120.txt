User: Here is the problem...
I'm writing very small plugin for Blender,
I have 10 python scripts, they parsing different file formats by using command-line, and I have a Main Python script to run all other scripts with proper commands...
for example, "Main.py" include:
txt2cfg.py -inFile -outFile...
ma2lxo.py -inFile -outFile...
Blender already include Python, so I can run "Main.py" from Blender, But I need it to work with both PC and MAC, and also doesn't require Python installation, so I can't use:

execfile(' txt2cfg.py -inFile -outFile ')
os.system(' ma2lxo.py -inFile -outFile ')
or even import subprocess

because they required Python installation in order to run *.py files.
Sorry for language
Thanks
Assistant: Two options:

Use py2exe to bundle the interpreter with the scripts.
Import the modules and call the functions automatically.
