**ATT&CK ID:** S0524  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** AndroidOS/MalLocker.B

### Description
AndroidOS/MalLocker.B employs several obfuscation techniques, including name mangling and the use of meaningless variable names in its source code. Additionally, the malware stores its encrypted payload code within the `Assets` directory. It uses a custom decryption routine to assemble a `.dex` file by passing the encrypted data through Android `Intent` objects. [1]
