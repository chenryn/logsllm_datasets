User: I am trying to build a script that opens the Google Earth.app which I can see in Finder, but when I go to the applications folder it is not present. I looked at some other posts to find the filepath of Google Earth.app via sudo find / -iname *.app, which was /Applications/Google Earth.app. When I try and find this file I get 'No such file or directory'. Could some one please explain why you applications that are in Finder don't show up in terminal? Also how would I find the correct file path so I can use subprocess.Popen() to open Google Earth in Python.
Assistant: Two problems going on here:
1) That path is probably correct. You're not using find correctly, in particular. You need to do sudo find / -name "*.app" (note the quotes around *app). From the man page:

-iname pattern
      Like -name, but the match is case insensitive. For example, the patterns 'fo*' and 'F??' match the file names 'Foo', 'FOO', 'foo', 'fOo', etc. In these patterns, unlike filename expansion by the shell, an initial '.' can be matched by '*'. That is, find -name *bar will match the file '.foobar'. Please note that you should quote patterns as a matter of course, otherwise the shell will expand any wildcard characters in them. 

2) Try using subprocess.Popen(["/Applications/Google Earth.app"], shell=True). Don't worry too much about security problems with shell=True unless you are taking user input. If it's just hardcoded to use your path to Google Earth, you're fine. If you have user input in your logic, however, DO NOT use shell=True. shell=True just means that shell metacharacters will work if they are in the command. The reason you need it is that subprocess.Popen() will have trouble parsing your command since there is a space in the path. Alternatively, you could just use os.system("/Applications/Google Earth.app").
