### Cost-Benefit Considerations and Miss Rate Analysis

For cost-benefit considerations, we analyze the miss rate as a function of \( \frac{1}{v} \) (rejuvenation cost). The function exhibits different properties depending on the type of source:

- **Independent Source (indv)**: The miss rate function is convex and monotone.
- **Exclusive Source (excv)**: The miss rate function is monotone and concave between integral values of \( \frac{1}{v} \). When restricted to integral values of \( \frac{1}{v} \), the miss rate through excv is a convex and monotone decreasing function of \( \frac{1}{v} \).

The trade-offs generated by integral values of \( \frac{1}{v} \) define the lower envelope of the set of trade-offs for all possible values of \( \frac{1}{v} \). To achieve the smallest miss rate for a particular cost \( x \), the source should alternate between rejuvenating with parameters \( v_1 \) and \( v_2 \) where \( \frac{1}{v_1} = \lfloor x \rfloor \) and \( \frac{1}{v_2} = \lceil x \rceil \). This alternation should be infrequent or avoided altogether by balancing the cost through several objects, each having a fixed rejuvenation frequency.

### Simulation Results

- **Poisson Arrivals**:
  - For Poisson arrivals, similar patterns are observed, but these patterns are not universally true for all sequences. For example, it is possible to construct sequences where the miss rate with \( \text{exc}_{\frac{1}{2}} \) is strictly lower than with \( \text{exc}_{\frac{1}{3}} \).

### Trace-Based Simulations

- The results for the SD trace were similar and are not shown.
- The simulations show the presence of patterns obtained in our Poisson analysis.
- Treatment of no-cache requests did not significantly affect general patterns, but some loss of synchronization (see Section 3) caused the patterns to be somewhat smeared for the indv sources.
- The patterns were evident in the sampled traces UC0.1 and SD0.1, but to a lesser extent due to lower request rates.

### Lessons and Implications

#### Tuning Higher-Level Caches

- **Sporadic Pre-term Refreshes**: Under various circumstances, sporadic pre-term refreshes or poorly timed rejuvenations can result in inferior performance of a client-cache compared to the basic exc source.
- **Synchronization**: Synchronization of a client with the source cache ensures that the client's performance is no worse than its performance through the basic exc source. An excv source remains synchronized with all clients only if \( \frac{1}{v} \) is an integer.
- **Handling No-Cache Requests**:
  1. Serve the no-cache request by contacting an origin server but refrain from updating the expiration time on the cached copy.
  2. Update the expiration time of the copy but perform a follow-up pre-term refresh at the original expiration time.

#### Trade-offs

- Rejuvenation policies and follow-up refreshes increase upstream traffic between the high-level cache and origin servers while potentially reducing user-perceived latency and downstream traffic.
- The cost is the number of unsolicited refresh requests issued by the high-level cache, and the benefit is the reduction in the number of misses incurred at client caches.
- The objective is to maximize the benefit (minimize the total number of misses at client-caches) given a bound on the cost.
- A general guideline is that rejuvenation frequencies with integral \( \frac{1}{v} \) dominate all others. Mixing two rejuvenation intervals such that \( \frac{1}{v_1} \) and \( \frac{1}{v_2} \) are consecutive integers provides equal or higher benefit compared to other choices with the same or lesser cost.

### Extended Lifetime

In some scenarios, client caches use longer freshness lifetimes than their source, either due to different configurations or intentional attempts to reduce miss rates and outgoing traffic. We consider client caches that apply an extended freshness lifetime value of \( r \times T \) for some \( r > 1 \) (where \( T \) is the freshness lifetime used by the source).

- **Extension Factor**: The extension factor \( r \) is controlled by the client cache. Varying the extension factor is not equivalent to varying the rejuvenation interval.
- **Miss Rate and Coherence**: Extending lifetimes cannot increase the miss rate through any of the three basic source models (auth, exc, or ind), but it decreases coherence.
- **Trade-off Curve**: The trade-off curve of the extension factor vs. the miss rate for different source types shows which extension factor values achieve the best balance.

**Lemma 7.1**: For an exc(r) source and a request sequence where the object is requested at least once every \( (\lceil r \rceil - r)T \) time units, the miss rate is the same as with exc(⌊r⌋).

### Poisson and Pareto Arrivals

- **Poisson Arrivals**: The miss rate through different source types can be calculated as a function of \( r \) and \( \lambda \).
- **High Request Rates**: The miss rate of exc(r) is approximately \( \frac{1}{\lambda \lfloor r \rfloor} \), which is a step-like function with drops at integral values of \( r \).
- **Trade-off Curve**: The trade-off curve of miss rate vs. extension is concave between any two integral values of \( r \) but is convex and monotone decreasing when restricted to integral values of \( r \).

**Figure 13**: Miss rate as a function of the extension factor for different source types and request rates.

- The figure illustrates the monotone convex dependence for auth and ind sources.
- Across all request rates, exc(r) outperforms ind(r) for integral \( r \)'s but is outperformed by ind(r) on some intermediate values.
- For low request rates, exc(r) and ind(r) converge, and are separated from auth(r).
- For high request rates, exc(r) becomes more step-like: its performance on integral values of \( r \) converges to that of auth(r), but for non-integral values, it can be strongly outperformed by ind(r).
