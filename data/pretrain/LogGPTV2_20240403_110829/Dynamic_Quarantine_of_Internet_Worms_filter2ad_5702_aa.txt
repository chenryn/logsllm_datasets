**Abstract:**
This paper explores the effectiveness of rate control mechanisms in mitigating the spread of Internet worms. We analyze different deployment strategies for rate control, including individual hosts, edge routers, and backbone routers, using both analytical models and simulation experiments. Our findings indicate that rate control at individual hosts or edge routers results in a linear slowdown proportional to the number of nodes implementing the rate limiting filters. In contrast, rate control at backbone routers is significantly more effective, achieving a comparable slowdown to deploying rate limiting filters at every individual host. This result holds even when dynamic immunization is considered. We validate our models using real traffic traces from a campus network, demonstrating that rate throttling can be enforced with minimal impact on legitimate communications while significantly slowing down worm propagation.

## 1. Introduction

Since the first "Internet worm" in 1988, computer worms have continued to cause significant damage on the Internet. For example, the SQL Slammer worm infected over 90% of vulnerable hosts within ten minutes. Manual patching approaches are insufficient, necessitating automated detection and response systems. One promising technique is rate control, which limits the contact rate of worm traffic. Previous studies have focused on deploying rate control at the individual host level. This paper extends this analysis to include edge and backbone routers, and considers both random propagation and local-preferential connection worms.

Our results show that rate control at individual hosts and edge routers yields a linear slowdown proportional to the number of nodes with rate limiting filters. However, rate control at backbone routers is substantially more effective, achieving a similar slowdown to universal deployment at individual hosts. These findings hold true for both random propagation worms (e.g., Code Red I) and preferential connection worms. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic immunization, where the rate of immunization increases as the worm spreads and knowledge disseminates. This approach contrasts with traditional models that assume a constant immunization rate.

To provide context, we analyze real traffic traces from a campus network. We find that limiting the rate of unique IP addresses contacted from the edge of the network to no more than 16 per five-second period has minimal impact on legitimate traffic. Our traces also captured the behavior of machines infected by the Welchia and Blaster worms, confirming that infected machines exhibit much higher contact rates and can be dramatically slowed by rate limiting.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 provides background on epidemiological models, Sections 4 and 5 study deployment strategies for rate limiting schemes, Section 6 incorporates dynamic immunization, and Section 7 presents a case study of real network traces. We conclude in Section 8.

## 2. Related Work

Several studies have investigated computer worms and their propagation. Stanford et al. [13] studied different types of worms and their potential damage. Zou et al. [19] analyzed the Code Red worm and proposed an analytic model for its propagation. Moore et al. [10] examined the Slammer worm and its effects on the Internet. These studies, however, did not deeply analyze defense mechanisms. Moore et al. [11] explored the design space for worm containment systems, concluding that detection and containment must be initiated within minutes. Singh et al. [12] proposed a system for real-time detection of unknown worms using traffic analysis and content signatures. Zou et al. [18] suggested monitoring unused address space on ingress and egress routers to detect early-stage worm propagation.

Our work differs by focusing on the analysis of rate control. As demonstrated in Sections 5 and 6, rate control mechanisms can be highly effective if deployed correctly. Williamson [17] proposed host-based rate limiting by restricting new outgoing connections, while Ganger et al. [5] proposed a scheme based on abnormal DNS lookup patterns. Both these schemes are host-based and did not explore other deployment options.

## 3. Background: Epidemiological Models

Epidemiological models, particularly homogeneous models, are widely used to study human infections. A homogeneous model assumes equal contact among all individuals in the population, similar to how random propagation worms spread in computer networks. The model assumes a connected network with \( N \) nodes and an average infection rate \( \beta \) across all links. The time evolution of the number of infected nodes \( I(t) \) is given by:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta I \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right)
\]

The solution to this equation is:

\[
\frac{I}{N} = \frac{e^{\beta t}}{c + e^{\beta t}}
\]

where \( c \) is a constant determined by the initial infection level. When the initial infection level is low, \( c \approx N - 1 \), and the fraction of infected hosts is small. The infection grows exponentially initially and reaches saturation after a certain point. The time to reach a certain infection level \( \alpha \) is approximately:

\[
t \approx \frac{\ln \alpha}{\beta}
\]

The analytical models in the later sections are derived from this basic homogeneous model and share the same assumptions.

## 4. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting restricts the communication rate between network elements, which can help suppress worm propagation. Several rate limiting schemes have been proposed, including Williamson's virus throttle [17] and Ganger's DNS-based scheme [5]. However, the optimal deployment strategy for rate control is not well understood. Deploying rate control on every node is administratively expensive and impractical. Therefore, we investigate alternative deployment strategies using a star graph topology.

### Deployment at Leaf Nodes

Assume we deploy rate limiting filters at \( q \) percent of the leaf nodes. Let \( x_1 = I(1 - q) \) be the number of infected nodes without filters, and \( x_2 = Iq \) be the number of infected nodes with filters. Let \( \beta_1 \) be the contact rate of infected hosts without filters, and \( \beta_2 \) be the contact rate allowed by the filters, with \( \beta_1 \gg \beta_2 \).

The time evolution of the infection is:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = x_1 \beta_1 \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right) + x_2 \beta_2 \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right)
\]

Solving this equation gives:

\[
\frac{I}{N} = \frac{e^{\lambda t}}{c + e^{\lambda t}}
\]

where \( \lambda = q \beta_2 + (1 - q) \beta_1 \). When \( \beta_1 \gg \beta_2 \) and \( e^{\lambda t} \) is small, \( \lambda \approx \beta_1 (1 - q) \). The time to reach a certain infection level \( \alpha \) is:

\[
t = \frac{\ln \alpha}{\beta_1 (1 - q)}
\]

Thus, the rate of infection is proportional to \( 1 - q \), the percentage of nodes without rate limiting filters.

### Deployment at Hub Node

When deploying rate control at the central hub node, we consider both node-level and link-level rate limiting. Assume we deploy rate limiting at the hub node with rate \( \beta \) and link rate limiting with rate \( \gamma \).

For link-level rate limiting, when the contact rate at the hub node is higher than the combined contact rates of all infected leaf nodes, we have:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \gamma I \left(1 - \frac{I}{N}\right), \quad \text{when } \gamma I \leq \beta
\]

Solving this equation gives:

\[
\frac{I}{N} = \frac{e^{\gamma t}}{c + e^{\gamma t}}, \quad \text{when } \gamma I \leq \beta
\]

The time to reach an infection level \( \alpha \) is:

\[
t \approx \frac{N \ln \alpha}{\beta}
\]

Compared to rate control at the leaf nodes, this suggests a slowdown comparable to installing rate control filters at all leaf nodes. Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) show the analytical and simulated infection evolution for a 200-node star topology, confirming that rate control at the hub node is significantly more effective.

## 5. Deploying Rate Control on the Internet

### 5.1. Rate Limiting at Individual Hosts

Deploying rate limiting at individual hosts requires each host to implement rate limiting filters. This approach is effective only if filters are universally deployed, as the slowdown is linearly proportional to the number of nodes with filters.

### 5.2. Rate Limiting at Edge Routers

Edge routers can enforce rate limiting on incoming and outgoing traffic. This approach is more practical than individual host deployment but still results in a linear slowdown proportional to the number of edge routers with filters.

### 5.3. Rate Limiting at Backbone Routers

Backbone routers, which handle a large volume of traffic, are the most effective location for rate limiting. Deploying rate control at backbone routers achieves a significant slowdown, comparable to universal deployment at individual hosts. This is because backbone routers can control the flow of traffic across the entire network, effectively slowing down the spread of worms.

## 6. Incorporating Dynamic Immunization

Dynamic immunization involves increasing the rate of immunization as the worm spreads and knowledge disseminates. This approach contrasts with traditional models that assume a constant immunization rate. Our models incorporate dynamically changing immunization rates, providing a more realistic scenario. The results show that even with dynamic immunization, rate control at backbone routers remains highly effective.

## 7. Case Study: Real Network Traces

We analyze real traffic traces from a sizable campus computing network. We find that limiting the rate of unique IP addresses contacted from the edge of the departmental network to no more than 16 per five-second period has minimal impact on legitimate traffic. Individual host rates can be kept to under four per five-second period. Limiting non-DNS-translated IP address contacts can further reduce the contact rate by a factor of 2 to 4. Our traces also captured the behavior of machines infected by the Welchia and Blaster worms, confirming that infected machines exhibit much higher contact rates and can be dramatically slowed by rate limiting.

## 8. Conclusion

This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of rate control mechanisms in mitigating the spread of Internet worms. We find that rate control at individual hosts and edge routers results in a linear slowdown, while rate control at backbone routers is significantly more effective. These findings hold true even when dynamic immunization is considered. By analyzing real traffic traces, we confirm that rate throttling can be enforced with minimal impact on legitimate communications while significantly slowing down worm propagation. Future work will focus on developing more sophisticated rate control mechanisms and exploring additional deployment strategies.
