Case Studies 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hwy_11_Ontario_Winter.JPG 
Driving Case Study 
•
Speeding 
•
Windshield wipers without lights in rain 
•
Foglights without fog 
•
algorithmic specifications for laws  
•
built in time constraints, warning periods, higher limits? 
•
driving the speed limit will get you run off the road in most major metropolitan areas 
•
license plate identification 
•
emergency override? 
•
remote disable by police?, on star, manufacturer, change programming of engine chip, corvette with key to 
disable 4 of eight cylinders 
•
requirement to broadcast laws? (like marking w/speed zones, school zones with signs, “speed zone ahead” 
•
security vulnerabilities in ALE systems, failure modes, possibilities for misuse 
•
ignorance of law is no excuse 
•
internal sensors (limited knowledge of local laws? centrally fed?  updated? validated?  
•
external sensors (like a speed camera) may have localize knowledge? 
•
law DB, updates?  validated how? 
•
what legal loopholes/defenses will emerge 
•
for some areas technology isn’t ready to enforce laws, but in some areas it is 
•
rental cars (you don’t own it, therefore you rights are less) 
•
road use tolls (in news) 
•
role of easy pass like systems 
•
role of onstar 
•
•
Case Law / Legal Defenses 
•
Legal defenses against ALE systems (look to radar guns, red light cameras, speed cameras) 
•
Calibration 
•
Radar vs GPS tracking device http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2009/0911/p02s01-usgn.html

Three Points (redux) 
1. Networked technologies have the 
potential to automate enforcement of the 
law. 
2. Reckless and pervasive automation can 
have disastrous and unintended 
consequences. 
3. This audience is in a unique position to 
defend society and appropriately confront 
law enforcement systems.
