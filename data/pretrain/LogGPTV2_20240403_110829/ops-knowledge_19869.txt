User: How to create and manage users, groups and permissions in Linux system? Please give command examples and detailed operation methods.
Assistant: Create a user: Add a user: useradd For example, add a user named newuser: ``` useradd newuser ``` Set a password: passwd For example, set a password for a newuser user: ``` passwd newuser ``` Delete a user: userdel For example, delete a name User for newuser: ``` userdel newuser ``` Create a group: Add a group: groupadd For example, add a group named testgroup: ``` groupadd testgroup ``` Delete a group: groupdel For example, delete a group named testgroup: ` `` groupdel testgroup ``` Add user to group: usermod -a -G For example, add newuser user to testgroup group: ``` usermod -a -G testgroup newuser ``` Set file permissions: chmod For example, file.txt file Set to read-only permission: ``` chmod 400 file.txt ``` The format of this command is: chmod mode file name where the mode has three digits, which respectively represent the permissions of the file owner, the group to which the file belongs, and other users. Each number represents read, write, and execute permissions, and each number can be any of the following three numbers: 4, 2, 1, where 4 represents read permission, 2 represents write permission, 1 represents execute permission, and no permission means Use 0. For example: the rwx permission is represented by the number 4+2+1=7, the rw- permission is represented by the number 4+2=6, and the r-- permission is represented by the number 4. Modify the file owner and group: chown For example, change the owner of the file.txt file to newuser and the group to testgroup: ``` chown newuser:testgroup file.txt ``` where newuser:testgroup means the new owner and the new group they belong to. The above are the command examples and detailed operation methods for creating and managing users, groups and permissions in the Linux system.
