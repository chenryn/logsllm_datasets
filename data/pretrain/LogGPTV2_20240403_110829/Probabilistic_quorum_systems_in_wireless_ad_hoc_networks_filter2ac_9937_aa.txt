Abstract
Quorums are a basic construct in solving many fundamen(cid:173)
tal distributed computing problems. One ofthe known ways of
making quorums scalable and efficient is by weakening their
intersection guarantee to being probabilistic. This paper ex(cid:173)
plores several access strategies for implementing probabilis(cid:173)
tic quorums in ad hoc networks. In particular, we present the
first detailed study ofasymmetric probabilistic bi-quorum sys(cid:173)
tems and show its advantages in ad hoc networks. The paper
includes both aformal analysis ofthese approaches backed by
a simulation based study. In particular, we show that one of
the strategies, based on Random Walks, exhibits the smallest
communication overhead.
1 Introduction
Quorums are a basic construction in many distributed sys(cid:173)
tems. They can be used as building blocks (or at least as de(cid:173)
sign pattern) in solving various fundamental problems such
as Consensus [16], distributed dictionaries and location ser(cid:173)
vices [12], distributed storage [2, 25], etc. While most imple(cid:173)
mentations of quorum systems are deterministic, some works
have suggested the use of probabilistic quorums as a way of
improving their resilience, efficiency, and scalability [27].
The idea behind quorums is that they ensure intersection
between subsets of nodes. The intersection property enables
maintaining consistency of actions taken by nodes of a dis(cid:173)
tributed system. This is achieved by contacting a quorum
of nodes before completing operations which might conflict
other operations. This ensures that any two such actions are
seen by at least one common node, which enables the detec(cid:173)
tion and elimination of conflicts.
In ad hoc networks, location services are one of the most
important services for many of the envisioned applications,
as they enable users to find information and services stored
by others. As discussed in [12], a very large percentage of
location services are based on bi-quorums. Recently, there
have been several attempts to solve Consensus and distributed
storage in ad hoc networks, e.g., [7, 10,24]. As mentioned
before, these also require quorums.
In this paper we investigate the implementation of scal-
able probabilistic quorums in ad hoc networks.
In wireless
ad hoc networks, routing and flooding are extremely expen(cid:173)
sive. Hence, applications and services developed for these
networks should avoid multiple hop routing and flooding as
much as possible, and instead aspire to rely solely on local
one-hop message exchanges. The dynamic nature of ad hoc
network (caused by chum and nodes mobility) makes the us(cid:173)
age of strict deterministic quorums highly costly. Hence, for
the sake of scale and efficiency, we relax the requirements of
the quorum system to probabilistic ones, similar to [27].
One could potentially use geographical knowledge for con(cid:173)
struction of quorum systems in ad hoc network (e.g., [21,32]).
However, as GPS and other accurate positioning techniques
may not always be available, and since the network's bound(cid:173)
aries are not always known, in this paper we look for quorum
systems that do not rely on geographical knowledge.
Contributions of this work. We propose several schemes
for accessing probabilistic quorums in ad hoc networks. We
study the performance of the proposed schemes both analyti(cid:173)
cally and by simulations. In particular, one of the schemes we
investigate is based on random walks (RW). The use of RWs
in wireless ad hoc networks has been previously proposed
to solve various problems such as membership construc(cid:173)
tion [11, 5], reliable multicast [11], routing [30] and query(cid:173)
ing [3]. RWs are attractive for ad hoc networks since they
require neither multi-hop routing nor broadcasting, which are
expensive in ad hoc networks [5]. Also, they offer fine grain
control over the communication overhead as well as early
halting capabilities, as elaborated later in this paper.
An important contribution of this work is the introduc(cid:173)
tion of the first asymmetric probabilistic bi-quorum system.
Specifically, in previous works, e.g., [23, 24, 27], accesses
to all quorums of a probabilistic bi-quorum system are per(cid:173)
formed using the same access strategy.} In that respect, all
previously known probabilistic bi-quorum systems are sym(cid:173)
metric. In our work, we show that it is possible to combine
different access strategies (and different quorum sizes) and
still obtain intersection with high probability. Moreover, in
ad hoc networks, such asymmetric bi-quorum systems offer
1In [23,24], the authors use the term "asymmetric probabilistic quorums",
however the asymmetry in [23, 24] refers to different quorum sizes and not
different access strategies.

superior performance compared to symmetric ones.
Additionally, for random walks, we provide a definition of
the crossing time of RWs and a lower bound on the cross(cid:173)
ing time in random geometric graphs. We also investigate the
partial cover time (peT) of RWs in random geometric graphs
when small fractions of the network should be covered. To
capture the reliability of the quorum systems in dynamic en(cid:173)
vironments we present a new metric, called degradation rate.
2 Preliminaries
Quorums and Bi-Quorums. Intuitively, a quorum system is
a set of subsets such that every two subsets intersect. More(cid:173)
over, a bi-quorum system consists of two sets of subsets such
that each subset in one set intersects with each subset in the
other set. Below, we provide a formal definition of these no(cid:173)
tions, following the works of [13, 15, 19, 29].
of v2• The combination of the nodes and the neighborhood
relations forms a wireless ad hoc network.
The network connectivity graph of an ad hoc network
is often modelled as a two dimensional Random Geometric
Graph(RGG) [17], denoted G2(n, r). Each node knows all of
its direct neighbors (by using a simple heartbeat mechanism
that is present in any case in most routing algorithms for ad
hoc networks) and can communicate with them directly. A
node can also communicate with other distant nodes whose
address it knows by applying routing. Nodes do not know
their position and we do not use any geographic knowledge.
New nodes may join and existing nodes may leave the net(cid:173)
work at any time, either gracefully or by suffering a crash
failure. Nodes that crash or leave the network may rejoin it
later. The rate at which nodes join and leave the system in
known as the churn rate of the system. We assume that the
network remains continuously connected.

3 Quorum Systems Metrics
Definition 2.2 (Quorum System) A quorum system Q over
a universe U is a set system over U such thatJor any Q1, Q2 E
Q, Q1 n Q2 -10.
Definition 2.3 (Hi-quorum System) A bi-quorum system Q
over a universe U is a couple oj set systems (Q1, Q2) such
thatJor any Q1 E Q1 and Q2 E Q2, Q1 n Q2 -I 0.
In this work we focus on bi-quorums. We will also refer to
them here as lookup and advertise quorums given that
bi-quorums are often used in conjunction with lookup and ad(cid:173)
vertise operations.However, the discussion applies the same
for any bi-quorum system. A data discovery service as well
as any distributed dictionary can be implemented using an ad(cid:173)
vertise/lookup quorum system as follows: Publishing a data
item is implemented by contacting all members of a single
advertise quorum and having them store the information.
Looking up the data is performed by contacting a lookup
quorum. The intersection between any advertise quorum
and any lookup quorum ensures that if a data item has been
published, it will be found by the lookup operation.
Probabilistic Quorums.
In probabilistic quorums [27], a
quorum system is not fixed a-priori, but is rather picked in
a probabilistic manner for each interaction with the quorum
system. For example, in the case of bi-quorums, such as
lookup/advertise quorums, it is ensured that each (randomly
selected) lookup quorum intersects with every (randomly
selected) advertise quorum with a given probability.
Ad Hoc Network System Model. Consider a set of nodes
spread across a geographical area and communicating by ex(cid:173)
changing messages using a wireless medium. Each node v
may send messages that can be received by all other nodes
within its transmission range rv. A node u is a neighbor of
another node v if u is located within the transmission range
Any implementation of a probabilistic quorum system can
be analyzed according to the following quality measures [27]:
Intersection probability: Probabilistic quorum system Q is
an c-intersecting if the total access probability of pairs of in(cid:173)
tersecting quorums is at least 1 - c.
Access cost: The cost (in messages) of accessing a quorum.
Load: The request load on a single node. The target is to bal(cid:173)
ance the request load equally between the nodes.
Failure resilience: The resilience of the quorum system to
failures. It is measured by two parameters:
1) Fault tolerance of a quorum system Q is the size of the
smallest set of nodes that intersects all quorums in Q (Le., the
minimal number of nodes whose crash will leave the system
without any quorum). As shown by [27], the fault tolerance of
a probabilistic quorum system of size '-Vii is n - '-Vii + 1 =
n(n ). In ad hoc network it is also required that the quorum
nodes form a connected graph (see Section 5.2.
2) Failure probability of a quorum system is the probability
that the system becomes disabled when individual nodes crash
independently with a fixed probability p. As shown by [27],
the failure probability of a probabilistic quorum system of size
fVii is e-OCn) for all p ~ 1 - In. Again, in ad hoc network,
quorum nodes must also form a connected graph.
Failure resilience refers to the resilience of the whole quo(cid:173)
rums system to failures. As long as the entire quorum system
has not failed, a live quorum can be found. But it does not
capture the chance of survival of a previously accessed quo(cid:173)
rum. In this work we introduce the following novel measure:
Degradation rate: The probability of a given quorum to stay
alive as a function of time when individual nodes crash inde(cid:173)
pendently with fixed probability. For probabilistic quorums,
this translates to the probability that two quorums accessed
2In practice, the transmission range does not behave exactly as a disk
due to various physical phenomena. However, this does not affect the access
strategies, but greatly simplifies the formal model. At any event, our simula(cid:173)
tion results are carried on a simulator that simulates a real transmission range
behavior including distortions, background noise, unidirectional links, etc.

these two accesses f nodes have crashed. Hence, degrada(cid:173)

of dynamic changes. The degradation rate helps determin(cid:173)

freshed, in order to recover from failures and node departures.
4 Quorum Access Strategies
An access strategy defines the way in which a client try(cid:173)
ing to access a probabilistic quorum propagates its requests.
The access strategy may impact all the measures of a quorum
system we presented above. In a bi-quorum system, it is pos(cid:173)
sible to mix and match between the access strategies used for
lookup quorums and those used for advertise quorums based,
e.g., on the relative frequency of requests of each type.
In this paper we focus on three main strategies:
RANDOM, PATH and FLOODING. RANDOM simply ac(cid:173)
cesses a set of random, uniformly chosen nodes. PATH is a
Random Walk, which traverses the network graph for a prede(cid:173)
fined number of steps (time to live - TTL) to cover a sufficient
set of different nodes. FLOODING performs a limited scope
flooding of the network, which covers a set of different nodes.
We also consider several optimizations for these basic tech(cid:173)
niques. The main novelty of our approach is an ability to mix
those strategies in different ways, achieving various tradeoffs
discussed below. More specifically, we show that in order to
construct probabilistic quorum systems, not every quorum has
to be accessed with a RANDOM strategy, as was previously
done, e.g., in [24, 27]. Instead, some quorums can be accessed
by other, more attractive methods.

and qualitative properties of various combinations of access

strategies.
strategies for implementing advertise and lookup quo(cid:173)
rums (note that the results are analogous if we switch strate(cid:173)
gies between lookup and advertise). RANDOM-OPT
stands for the RANDOM strategy with the cross layer op(cid:173)
timization, discussed in Section 6.
In all strategies, a quo(cid:173)
rum of size 8(Vii) is accessed (except for PATHxPATH,
FLOODINGxFLOODING and FLOODINGxPATH). We
elaborate on each of the strategies and the corresponding en(cid:173)
tries in the table below. Yet, even before delving into the de-
tails, it can already be seen that the PATH strategy used for
accessing lookup quorums wins in all categories: it has the
lowest cost, does not require additional routing, has an early
stopping property and does not incur a burden of sending mul(cid:173)
tiple replies. We now tum to the details:
RANDOM access strategy.
In this method, a quorum (be it
lookup or advertise) is simply any random, uniformly
chosen, set of nodes Q. In order to choose Q, we can either
rely on a membership service or sample the nodes directly.
Membership Service based Implementation.
If a list of
all node ids in the system is available (it can be obtained
through a standard membership service [9]), we can simply
randomly select node ids from it. Alternatively, we can uti(cid:173)
lize a random membership service for ad hoc networks, such
as RaWMS [5], which provides the required sampling capa(cid:173)
bilities. Once nodes' ids for a given quorum have been fixed,
accessing this quorum can be done by sending a message to
each of these nodes through unicast routing. For a quorum of
size IQI we need to send messages to IQI nodes. Thus, at the
application level, the cost is IQI. However, since we are oper(cid:173)
ating over ad hoc networks, the true number has to take into
account the cost of multi-hop routing, which includes both
the cost of using the routes and establishing the routes. It is
well known ([ 17]) that the diameter of the random geometric
graph with transmission range r is 8 (1Ir) and the minimal r
to guarantee network connectivity is n(j!ij). Thus, assum(cid:173)
ing the nodes are uniformly distributed, the price of accessing
a quorum of this type is 8(IQI' 1/r) == O(IQI~). When
IQI == 8(Vii), the price is 0(&).
As for the cost of establishing the routes, it is hard to pre(cid:173)
dict analytically. This cost also depends on routes reuse. For
slow moving ad hoc networks with low chum rate, it is best
to reuse the same quorum between consecutive invocations
as long as all its members are reachable. This amortizes the
initial route discovery cost over several requests.
Direct Sampling based Implementation.
If no membership
service exists, a quorum can be picked directly by starting an
