# Description
It seems to me that the testing documentation is a bit outdated. At the very
beginning you are given an example async task that has a `self.retry` on the
`except` clause, which looks strange, as it is a function not a method of a
class/instance.
Moreover when searching at how to handle tracebacks from tasks, I ended up at
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/calling.html#linking-
callbacks-errbacks which looks like the modern practice? ðŸ¤”
# Suggestions
Rework the first snippet of code and mention how to use linking from a testing
perspective? ðŸ¤”
