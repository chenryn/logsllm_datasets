## Description
The testing documentation appears to be outdated. At the beginning, an example of an asynchronous task is provided, which includes a `self.retry` call within an `except` clause. This usage seems unusual, as `self.retry` is not a method of a class or instance, but rather a function.

Furthermore, while researching how to handle tracebacks from tasks, I found the following documentation: [Linking Callbacks and Errbacks](http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/calling.html#linking-callbacks-errbacks). It appears that this approach is the modern practice for handling such scenarios.

## Suggestions
- Revise the initial code snippet to reflect current best practices.
- Include information on how to use linking from a testing perspective.
