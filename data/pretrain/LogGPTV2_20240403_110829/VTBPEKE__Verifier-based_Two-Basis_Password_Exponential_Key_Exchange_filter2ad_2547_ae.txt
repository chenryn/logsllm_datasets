As a consequence, let us randomly choose pw 1 (cid:54)= pw 2 and P1,P2
R← Zp. we set U ←
(vP2/wP1)1/P2−P1 and V ← (v/U )1/P1, and for a query Hp(s, pw 1) we output P1, and for the
future Hp(s, pw 2) we will output P2. With probability 1/N 2qP , we have done the good choices
for pw 1 (among N ), pw 2 (among N ) and s (among at most qP queries to H(·, pw 1)): a tuple
(C, S, g, X, Y, Z, s) is very unlikely to raise the event Bad2H for two distinct choices P1 (cid:54)= P2,
but only for one, and there is one such tuple per session:
Pr[Bad2H] ≤ qs
N

q2P
p
+ N 2qP × Succ2qH−gsdh(t),
where t is the running time of the adversary (since the basic reduction is essentially the classical
attack). However, because of the N 2 loss, in case of a large dictionary, we can simply answer P1
and P2 for two randomly chosen Hp queries, and with probability 1/q2P these are the good ones:
Pr[Bad2H] ≤ qs

Conclusion. By combining all the bad cases, we have

where qS = qs + qe is the global number of sessions (qe for the passive sessions qs for the active
sessions), qH is the number of queries to H and qP is the number of queries to Hp.
7 Parameters and Eﬃciency
On Figure 5, we list a number of representative PAKE and VPAKE protocols, and compare their
security levels as well as the eﬃciency, from both the communication and the computation points
of view. For communication, we count the number of group elements (G), scalars (|p|), and bit
strings of length k, the security parameter, in both directions, but ignore the salt (for VPAKE).
For the computations, we focus on exponentiations (E is the cost of one exponentiation, while
sE is the cost of an exponentiation to a small scalar). While SRP does not admit any formal
security analysis, the authors recommend the use of a group of order p in a ﬁnite ﬁeld Z∗
q with a

safe prime q = 2p + 1, which leads to a very ineﬃcient construction, as for any implementation
that requires discrete logarithm in ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Our TBPEKE is the most eﬃcient PAKE (it even additionally provides forward secrecy): the
EKE construction is only proven in the ideal-cipher model (ICM), with a symmetric encryption
scheme over the cyclic group G, which is not eﬃciently implementable.
As AugPAKE, our VTBPEKE also allows some oﬀ-line pre-computation independent of the
password and the salt, on the client side. They have a similar communication complexity. Our
VTBPEKE is a bit more costly, but it is proven to guarantee the forward-secrecy in the Real-or-
Random security game, whereas AugPAKE is just proven secure in the Find-then-Guess security
game, without forward-secrecy.
For a PAKE or VPAKE, one expects the advantage of the adversary to be bounded by qs/N +ε.
With a safe and eﬃcient symmetric encryption scheme (as AES), we can ignore qS · AdvindE (t).
S ≤ p· 2−k, for the security parameter k: p ≥ 2k × (q2P ×
And we need to make q2P × (q2 + 20) + q2
(q2 + 20) + q2
S). A safe bound is p ≥ 25k (See Figure 6).
8 Conclusion
We have proposed a quite eﬃcient forward-secure veriﬁer-based password-authenticated key
exchange: the computations on the client side just consist of 4 exponentiations, and the global
communication is approximately 14k, for a security parameter k, which is approximately 224
Bytes for a 128-bit security level. It follows the line of SPEKE that has not been studied as much
as EKE, while it is also an interesting family, as this work shows. We have indeed proven that
– oﬀ-line dictionary attacks are only possible after the compromise of the server, but the
computational cost will be linear in N , the cardinality of the dictionary;
– on-line dictionary attacks also require a linear number of active attacks to guess the pass-
word;
– thanks to the forward-secrecy, even when the password or the veriﬁer are known, the privacy
of previous sessions still holds.
