Question: A security analyst is tasked with assessing the security of a web-based PL/SQL application. The application utilizes Oracle's PL/SQL Gateway to translate web requests into database queries. The analyst is aware that different implementations of the PL/SQL Gateway, such as the early web listener product, the Apache `mod_plsql` module, and the XML Database (XDB) web server, have their own unique security considerations. Which of the following vulnerabilities should the analyst be particularly vigilant about when assessing the application? (Select TWO.)
"A": "Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities due to improper handling of user input by the PL/SQL Gateway.",
"B": "Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting the underlying operating system rather than the PL/SQL Gateway itself.",
"C": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks facilitated by inadequate output encoding mechanisms in the PL/SQL Gateway.",
"D": "Buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the PL/SQL Gateway implementations that process web requests."
Answer: AC
