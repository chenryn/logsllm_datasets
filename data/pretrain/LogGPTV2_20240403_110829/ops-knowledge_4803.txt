User: I have a Google App Engine app where I need to store text files that are larger than 1 MB (the maximum entity size.  
I'm currently storing them in the Blobstore and I make use of the Files API for reading and writing them.  Current operations including uploading them from a user, reading them to process and update, and presenting them to a user.  Eventually, I would like to allow a user to edit them (likely as a Google doc).
Are there advantages to storing such text files in Google Cloud Storage, as a Google Doc, or in some other location instead of using the Blobstore?
Assistant: Sharing data is more easy in Google Docs (now Google Drive) and Google Cloud Storage. Using Google drive u can also use the power of Google Apps scripts.
