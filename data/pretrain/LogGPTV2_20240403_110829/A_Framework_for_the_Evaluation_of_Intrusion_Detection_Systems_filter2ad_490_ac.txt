It is easy to show that this optimal sensitivity point is the
same optimal point obtained with the isolines method for
mC,p = 1 (i.e. C = (1− p)/p).

proach
Although the graphical analysis introduced so far can be
applied to analyze the cost efﬁciency of several metrics, the
intuition for the tradeoff between the PPV and the NPV is
still not clear. Therefore we now extend the graphical ap-
proach by introducing a new pair of isolines, those of the
PPV and the NPV metrics.

have the same PPV value if and only if

where θ is the angle between the line PFA = 0 and the iso-
line. Moreover the PPV value of an isoline at angle θ is
PPVθ,p =

Similarly, two set of points (PFA1, PD1) and (PFA2, PD2)

are straight lines that depend only on θ. The

value of PPV changes from 1 to p. We can also see from ﬁg-
ure 5 that as φ ranges from 0
, the NPV value changes
from one to 1− p. Therefore if p is very small NPV ≈ 1. As
shown in Figure 6, it turns out that the most relevant metrics
to use for a tradeoff in the performance of an IDS are PPV
and PD.

However, even when you select as tradeoff parameters
the PPV and PD values, the isoline analysis shown in Fig-
ure 6 has still one deﬁciency when compared with the iso-
line performance analysis of the previous section, and it
is the fact that there is no efﬁcient way to represent how
the PPV changes with different p values. In order to solve
this problem we introduce the Intrusion Detector Operat-
ing Characteristic (IDOC) as a graph that shows how the
two variables of interest: PD and Pr[I = 1|A = 1] (the PPV
value) are related under different base-rate values of inter-
est. An example of an IDOC curve is presented in Figure
(7). Although we show p varying substantially in this ﬁg-
ure, the ﬁnal choice for the uncertainty region of p is the
choice of the user. Also note, for comparison purposes, that
the IDOC curve of a classiﬁer that performs random guess-
ing is just a vertical line intercepting the x-axis at p, since
Pr[I = 1|A = 1] = p.

We believe that the IDOC provides a better way to evalu-
ate IDS systems than most of the other previously proposed
metrics. The ROC curve analysis alone does not take into
account the estimated value of p. Furthermore, the operat-
ing points for an ROC might lead to misleading results as
we do not know how to interpret intuitively very low false
alarm rates where the precision might be misleading, e.g. is
−3? This same
PFA = 10
logic applies to the study of PPV vs NPV as we cannot
interpret precisely small variations in NPV values, e.g. is
NPV = 0.9998 much better than NPV = 0.99975? On the
−3 much better than PFA = 5× 10
other hand in the IDOC curve we are comparing tradeoffs
that are easier to interpret.

5. Threat Models and Security Properties of
the Evaluation
Traditional evaluation of intrusion detection schemes as-
sumes that an intruder behaves similarly before and after
the implementation of the IDS (i.e. a non-adaptive intruder).
Now consider an intruder who adapts its attack when it faces
a target system which hosts a given IDS.
For our evaluation analysis we were assuming three
quantities that can be, up to a certain extent, controlled by
the intruder. They are the base-rate p, the false alarm rate
PFA and the detection rate PD. The base-rate can be modi-
ﬁed by controlling the frequency of attacks. The perceived
false alarm rate can be increased if the intruder ﬁnds a ﬂaw
in any of the signatures of an IDS that allows him to send
maliciously crafted packets that trigger alarms at the IDS
but that look benign to the IDS operator. Finally, the detec-
tion rate can be modiﬁed by the intruder with the creation
of new attacks whose signatures do not match those of the
IDS, or simply by evading the detection scheme, for exam-
ple by the creation of a mimicry attack [34, 13].
In an effort towards understanding the advantage an in-
truder has by controlling these parameters, and to provide
a robust evaluation framework, we now present a formal
framework to reason about the robustness of an IDS eval-
uation method. Our work in this section is in some sense
similar to the theoretical framework presented in [6], which
was inspired by cryptographic models. However, we see
two main differences in our work. First, we introduce the
role of an adversary against the IDS, and thereby introduce
a measure of robustness for the metrics. In the second place,
our work is more practical and is applicable to more realistic

evaluation metrics. Furthermore we also provide examples
of practical scenarios where our methods can be applied.
In order to be precise in our presentation, we need to
extend the deﬁnitions introduced in section 2. For our mod-
eling purposes we decompose the I DS algorithm into two
parts: a detector D and a decision maker DM . For the
case of an anomaly detection scheme, D(x[ j]) outputs the
anomaly score y[ j] on input x[ j] and DM represents the
threshold that determines whether to consider the anomaly
score as an intrusion or not, i.e. DM (y[ j]) outputs an alarm
or it does not. For a misuse detection scheme, DM has to
decide to use the signature to report alarms or decide that
the performance of the signature is not good enough to jus-
tify its use and therefore will ignore all alarms (e.g. it is not
cost-efﬁcient to purchase the misuse scheme being evalu-
ated).
Deﬁnition 1 An I DS algorithm is the composition of algo-
rithms D (an algorithm from where we can obtain an ROC
curve) and DM (an algorithm responsible for selecting an
operating point). During operation, an I DS receives a con-
tinuous data stream of event features x[1],x[2], . . . and clas-
siﬁes each input x[ j] by raising an alarm or not. Formally:1

We now study the performance of an IDS under an ad-
versarial setting. We remark that our intruder model does
not represent a single physical attacker against the IDS. In-
stead our model represents a collection of attackers whose
average behavior will be studied under the worst possible
circumstances for the IDS.
The ﬁrst thing we consider, is the amount of information
the intruder has. A basic assumption to make in an adversar-
ial setting is to consider that the intruder knows everything
that we know about the environment and can make infer-
ences about the situation the same way as we can. Under
this assumption we assume that the base-rate ˆp estimated
by the IDS, its estimated operating condition ( ˆPFA, ˆPD) se-
lected during the evaluation, the original ROC curve (ob-
tained from D) and the cost function C(I, A) are public val-
ues (i.e. they are known to the intruder).
