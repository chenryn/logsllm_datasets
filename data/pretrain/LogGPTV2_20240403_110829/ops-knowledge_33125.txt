Certainly! Here is a more structured and professional version of the log entry:

```
Timestamp: 2005-06-18 02:23:10
Component: ftpd
Process ID (PID): 31277
Severity: Info
Message: User unknown timed out after 900 seconds.
```

This format clearly separates the different elements of the log, making it easier to read and understand.
