Abstract
We present a novel eavesdropping technique for spy-
ing at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbi-
trary computer screen, including the currently prevalent
LCD monitors. Our technique exploits reﬂections of
the screen’s optical emanations in various objects that
one commonly ﬁnds in close proximity to the screen and
uses those reﬂections to recover the original screen con-
tent. Such objects include eyeglasses, tea pots, spoons,
plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. We
have demonstrated that this attack can be successfully
mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive,
oﬀ-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a
distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expen-
sive equipment allowed us to conduct this attack from
over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar at-
tacks are feasible from the other side of the street or
from a close-by building. We additionally establish the-
oretical limitations of the attack; these limitations may
help to estimate the risk that this attack can be success-
fully mounted in a given environment.
1. Introduction
Side-channel attacks are a particularly salient ap-
proach for spying on conﬁdential data. As early as in
1985, electrical emanations of CRT screens were suc-
cessfully exploited to reconstruct the screen’s content
from a distance [12]. This attack was further reﬁned in
diverse variations of diﬀerent levels of sophistication,
e.g., emanations from the cable connecting an LCD
screen to the computer were successfully abused to re-
cover the content of the screen [6]. All these attacks are
grounded on the idea that an unexpected emanation of
the computer itself (or its display) is exploited. These
attacks can often be successfully prevented by shield-
ing the hardware to avoid the occurrence of these unex-
pected emanations, e.g., by using LCD displays instead
of CRT screens, by using specially insulated cables, by
using soundless keyboards, and so on.
Our work introduces a side-channel that is not an id-
iosyncrasy of the computer’s behavior, but it exploits
the visual emanation of the screen itself – and hence
its proper functionality – in combination with everyday
objects that are located in close proximity to the screen
such as tea pots, eyeglasses, plastic bottles, spoons, or
the eye of the user. Our approach is predicated on the
idea that the image of the screen can be reconstructed
from reﬂections on those objects, see Figure 1. We
focus on the (common) setting in which the screen is
facing away from the window, see Figure 2, and on
curved reﬂection surfaces, since reﬂections on these sur-
faces cover a very large area of the environment; this
increases the likelihood that a reﬂection of the screen’s
content can be eavesdropped on the object.
We demonstrate in this paper that this idea can be
successfully realized in practical scenarios, using inex-
pensive, oﬀ-the-shelf equipment of less than 1500 dol-
lars (a camera and a telescope) from a distance of up to
10 meters for spying on small fonts. Relying on a more
expensive telescope allowed us to conduct this attack
from over 30 m away. Particularly good results were
obtained from reﬂections in a user’s eyeglasses or a tea
pot located on the desk next to the screen. Reﬂections
that stem from the eye of the user also provide good re-
sults. However, eyes are harder to spy on at a distance
because they are fast-moving objects and require high
exposure times.
Our experiments indicate that this shortcoming can
be remedied by using more expensive equipment that

monitor was reduced for demonstration. Readability is essentially limited by the camera resolution.
oﬀers lower exposure times. Unlike the human eye,
glasses constitute an ideal target for our attack due
to their less extreme curvature. Additionally, we illus-
trate that reﬂections of non-emissive objects, e.g., pa-
pers that are located on the desk in close proximity to
a tea pot, can be exploited to spy on this object; this
might allow for spying on conﬁdential documents for
which no direct line of sight is given.
We have established lower bounds on the size of
the telescope (and consequently the amount of money)
needed to carry out this attack in diﬀerent scenarios.
The lower bounds rely on physical characteristics such
as diﬀraction (Rayleigh’s Criterion) as well as bounds
on the permitted exposure times.
From our experiments, we conclude that the reﬂec-
tions gathered from curved surfaces on close-by objects
indeed pose a substantial threat to the conﬁdentiality
of data displayed on the screen. Fully invalidating this
threat without at the same time hiding the screen from
the legitimate user seems diﬃcult, without using cur-
tains on the windows or similar forms of strong optical
shielding. Most users, however, will not be aware of
this risk and may not be willing to close the curtains
on a nice day.
1.1. Related Work
Military organizations have been rumored to deal
with compromising emanations since the 1960’s; the
results of these works, however, are conﬁdential. The
ﬁrst publicly known attack we are aware – published
in 1985 [12] – used electromagnetic radiation of CRT
monitors. An early discussion of these results can be
found in [4].
Various forms of emanations have since been ex-
ploited to spy on conﬁdential data. Electromagnetic
emanations have turned out to constitute a security
threat to computer equipment such as poorly shielded
2
RS-232 serial lines [11], keyboards [1], as well as the
digital cable connecting modern LCD monitors [6].
We refer to [7] for a discussion on the security lim-
its for electromagnetic emanation. Acoustic emana-
tions were shown to reveal text typed on ordinary
keyboards [2, 13], as well as information about the
CPU state and the instructions that are executed [10].
Acoustic emanations from printers were studied in [3].
The work that comes closest to ours is that diﬀuse
reﬂections of the light emitted by a CRT monitor can
be exploited to recover the original monitor image [5].
This approach exploits the point-wise image construc-
tion and the time-characteristics of the light-emitting
material used in CRT monitor. This technique hence
does not apply to monitors that do not construct im-
ages in this fashion; in particular, it does not apply to
LCD monitors. Information leakage from status LEDs
is studied in [8]. Reﬂections of images from a human
eye were already investigated in [9], but without secu-
rity questions in mind, in particular only for low reso-
lutions, small distances, and without taking diﬀraction
into account.
1.2. Outline
Section 2 reviews the relevant optical parameters
and describes their inﬂuence on images quality. Sec-
tion 3 contains our experimental results in various sce-
narios for the low-cost equipment. Section 4 shows that
the approach scales to larger distances by relying on a
more expensive telescope. Section 5 establishes theo-
retical lower bounds on the size of the telescope (and
consequently the amount of money) needed to carry
out this attack in diﬀerent scenarios, while Section 6
discusses the feasibility of our attack in realistic scenar-
ios. Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines future
work.
Let the distance from the monitor to the observer
be d, and let n be the desired resolution; the desired
resolution could be the actual monitor resolution, but
it could also can be lower, depending on the scenario.
In the following we will mainly use the full resolution,
but we will later discuss how these results scale with
a lower resolution. The optical resolution α (in radi-
ans) required to capture the full resolution is given by
α = arctan u1
nd, where the approximation holds as
u1 (cid:3) d and tan α ≈ α for α ≈ 0. In particular, α is
linear in the inverse of the distance d.
nd ≈ u1
2.2. Diﬀraction Bounds
Diﬀraction is a physical phenomenon that diﬀuses
light, or any other electromagnetic wave, whenever it
passes some aperture. It is best known for very small
apertures, where it is visible to the human eye.
In
the case of high magniﬁcations, however, even a large
aperture like the one of a telescope produces noticeable
diﬀraction; in fact, the diﬀraction constitutes one of the
limiting parameters in the use of modern telescopes.
The inﬂuence of diﬀraction on the maximum resolu-
tion of a telescope is given by Rayleigh’s Criterion. Let
two point sources P1, P2 be given such that the angle
between these two sources (as seen by the observer) is
α (in radians). Let D be the diameter of the objective
lens of the telescope and λ the wavelength of the light.
Then Rayleigh’s Criterion states that the two points
P1, P2 can be distinguished if and only if α ≥ 1.22λ
D . In
some of our experiments we were close to the theoret-
ical bound given by Rayleigh’s Criterion. Combining
the bounds from this section and from the previous
one, we obtain bounds on the maximum resolution for
a given distance and telescope aperture.
2.3. Exposure Time
Another important factor in our experiments turned
out to be the necessary exposure time. Since the ex-
posure time depends on many practical factors in the
setup (quality of the lenses, brightness of the screen,
color of the reﬂecting object, sensitivity of the ﬁlm/chip
in the camera, etc.) it does not seem possible to give
reasonable theoretical bounds on the exposure time. It
is known, however, that the exposure time is inversely
proportional to the intensity of the light per square an-
gle reaching the camera. Thus if all other values are
ﬁxed, the necessary exposure time is proportional to
the square of the magniﬁcation and inversely propor-
tional to the square of the aperture diameter.
(The
distance does not directly inﬂuence the exposure time,
but a larger distance will usually be compensated by
Figure 2. The basic setting: The monitor
faces away from the window in an attempt to
hide the screen’s content.
2. An Optics Primer
We start by reviewing the relevant parameters of the
optical system and describe their inﬂuence on image
quality. This allows us to better understand our exper-
imental results, and it will provide the basis for deriv-
ing lower bounds on the resources that are required to
mount the attack.
2.1. Size of the Reﬂected Image
The reﬂection of an object, in our case a computer
display, in a curved mirror creates a virtual image that
is located behind the reﬂecting surface. For a ﬂat mir-
ror this virtual image has the same size and is located
behind the mirror at the same distance as the original
object. For curved mirrors, however, the situation is
more complex.
In this section, we calculate the size
and the location of the virtual image.
The overall situation is depicted in Figure 3. It is
common to approximate a spherical mirror as a lens
of focal length f0 = r
2, provided that the width of the
mirror is small compared to its radius. The location b0
of the virtual image (the distance between the virtual
image and the reﬂecting surface), given the location a0
of the object, is given by the thin lens equation as
b0 =
1
r − 1
2
a0
.
The size u0 of the virtual image is given by u0 = b0x
a0 .
Finally, we have to consider that the image appears
smaller if seen from an angle γ; the apparent size u1 is
u1 = u0 · cos(γ).
