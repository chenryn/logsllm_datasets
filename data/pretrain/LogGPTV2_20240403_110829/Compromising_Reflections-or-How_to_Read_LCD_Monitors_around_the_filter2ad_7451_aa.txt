## Abstract
We introduce a novel eavesdropping technique that allows for spying on data displayed on arbitrary computer screens, including the widely used LCD monitors. This method exploits reflections of the screen's optical emanations in common objects found near the screen, such as eyeglasses, teapots, spoons, plastic bottles, and even the user's eye. We have successfully demonstrated this attack using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (under $1500) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Using more advanced equipment, we were able to conduct the attack from over 30 meters away, indicating the feasibility of similar attacks from across the street or from a nearby building. Additionally, we establish theoretical limitations of the attack, which can help in assessing the risk in different environments.

## 1. Introduction
Side-channel attacks are a significant approach for intercepting confidential data. As early as 1985, electrical emanations from CRT screens were exploited to reconstruct screen content from a distance [12]. Subsequent variations of this attack, including those targeting LCD screens, have been refined over the years. These attacks typically exploit unexpected emanations from the computer or its display, and can often be mitigated by shielding the hardware, using LCD displays instead of CRTs, insulated cables, and soundless keyboards.

Our work introduces a side-channel that leverages the visual emanation of the screen itself, combined with everyday objects near the screen, such as teapots, eyeglasses, plastic bottles, spoons, or the user's eye. The core idea is that the screen's image can be reconstructed from reflections on these objects. We focus on scenarios where the screen faces away from the window, and on curved reflection surfaces, which cover a large area and increase the likelihood of capturing the screen's content.

We demonstrate that this technique can be effectively realized in practical settings using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (a camera and a telescope) costing less than $1500, from a distance of up to 10 meters. With more expensive equipment, we achieved success from over 30 meters away. Notably, reflections from eyeglasses and teapots provided excellent results, while reflections from the user's eye, though also effective, required higher exposure times due to their rapid movement.

Our experiments suggest that this limitation can be addressed with more advanced equipment offering lower exposure times. Unlike the human eye, glasses are an ideal target due to their less extreme curvature. We also show that reflections from non-emissive objects, such as papers near a teapot, can be used to spy on documents, even when there is no direct line of sight.

We have established lower bounds on the size of the telescope and the associated cost required to carry out this attack in various scenarios, based on physical characteristics like diffraction and exposure time constraints.

From our experiments, we conclude that reflections from curved surfaces on nearby objects pose a substantial threat to the confidentiality of displayed data. Mitigating this threat without obstructing the legitimate user's view is challenging, except through the use of curtains or strong optical shielding. However, most users may not be aware of this risk and may not be willing to close curtains on a nice day.

### 1.1 Related Work
Military organizations have reportedly dealt with compromising emanations since the 1960s, but their findings remain confidential. The first publicly known attack, published in 1985 [12], exploited electromagnetic radiation from CRT monitors. Various forms of emanations have since been used to spy on confidential data, including electromagnetic emissions from poorly shielded RS-232 serial lines [11], keyboards [1], and digital cables connecting modern LCD monitors [6].

Acoustic emanations have been shown to reveal text typed on keyboards [2, 13] and information about CPU state and executed instructions [10]. Acoustic emanations from printers were studied in [3]. The closest work to ours is the exploitation of diffuse reflections from CRT monitors to recover the original image [5]. This technique does not apply to LCD monitors, which do not construct images in the same manner. Information leakage from status LEDs has been studied in [8]. Reflections from the human eye have been investigated in [9], but without considering security implications, and only at low resolutions and small distances, without accounting for diffraction.

## 2. An Optics Primer
We start by reviewing the relevant parameters of the optical system and their influence on image quality. This will help us understand our experimental results and provide a basis for deriving lower bounds on the resources required to mount the attack.

### 2.1 Size of the Reflected Image
The reflection of an object, in our case a computer display, in a curved mirror creates a virtual image behind the reflecting surface. For a flat mirror, the virtual image has the same size and is located at the same distance as the original object. For curved mirrors, the situation is more complex.

In this section, we calculate the size and location of the virtual image. The overall setup is depicted in Figure 3. A spherical mirror can be approximated as a lens with focal length \( f_0 = \frac{r}{2} \), provided the mirror's width is small compared to its radius. The location \( b_0 \) of the virtual image, given the location \( a_0 \) of the object, is given by the thin lens equation:

\[ b_0 = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{f_0} - \frac{1}{a_0}\right)} \]

The size \( u_0 \) of the virtual image is given by:

\[ u_0 = \frac{b_0}{a_0} \cdot u \]

Finally, the apparent size \( u_1 \) of the image, when viewed from an angle \( \gamma \), is:

\[ u_1 = u_0 \cdot \cos(\gamma) \]

### 2.2 Diffraction Bounds
Diffraction is a physical phenomenon that spreads light or other electromagnetic waves as they pass through an aperture. It is most noticeable with very small apertures, but even a large aperture like that of a telescope can produce noticeable diffraction, especially at high magnifications.

Rayleigh's Criterion states that two point sources \( P_1 \) and \( P_2 \) can be distinguished if the angle \( \alpha \) between them (as seen by the observer) satisfies:

\[ \alpha \geq \frac{1.22 \lambda}{D} \]

where \( D \) is the diameter of the objective lens of the telescope and \( \lambda \) is the wavelength of the light. In some of our experiments, we approached the theoretical bound given by Rayleigh's Criterion. Combining the bounds from this section and the previous one, we obtain bounds on the maximum resolution for a given distance and telescope aperture.

### 2.3 Exposure Time
Another critical factor in our experiments is the necessary exposure time. The exposure time depends on many practical factors, such as the quality of the lenses, brightness of the screen, color of the reflecting object, and sensitivity of the camera's sensor. While it is challenging to provide theoretical bounds on the exposure time, it is known that the exposure time is inversely proportional to the intensity of the light per square angle reaching the camera. Thus, if all other values are fixed, the necessary exposure time is proportional to the square of the magnification and inversely proportional to the square of the aperture diameter.

(The distance does not directly influence the exposure time, but a larger distance usually requires a higher magnification, which increases the exposure time.)
