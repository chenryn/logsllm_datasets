On the following page http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Pool an unnecessary empty
line is added to the code. It's probably because it contains unexported fields
an a new line before the public fields, but it would be nice if this empty is
not shown. The same happens in the text version of the page:
http://golang.org/pkg/sync/?m=text (manual scrolling required).
