measure the effectiveness in terms of system security. A
few studies have tried to assess performability aspects of
the system but left out economical aspects (e.g., operational
and/or capital cost). We discuss how the three metrics
(i.e., security, performability, and economical costs) can be
considered in Section XI.
• Lack of realistic testbeds: Most MTD approaches have
been validated based on analytical and/or simulation mod-
els while emulation-based or real testbed-based evaluation
methods are rarely used. This indicates a critical need for
developing better experimental testbeds for the veriﬁcation
and validation (V&V) to test the performance of diverse
types of MTD techniques.

study in order to investigate the effect of game strategies in
choosing platform migration on system security (i.e., mean
time to compromise or MTTC). Sengupta et al. [132] devel-
oped a real world MTD web application that can convert from
an application in Python to one in PHP and from a MySQL
database to a PostgreSQL database, or vice versa; and they
identiﬁed an optimal solution based on a real testbed.
Fig. 14 describes an example implementation architecture
of MTD for a cloud’s services in which server-replica of the
cloud-domain are shufﬂed [82].
Pros and Cons: The newer cloud technologies have embraced
the concept of infrastructure as a code; and an effective
deployment of MTD techniques in clouds not only strengthens
security, but also encourages innovation that leverages a new
way of handling and managing dynamic conﬁgurations and
infrastructure. With those technologies being leveraged, de-
ploying the MTD techniques in clouds are more feasible for
smaller and medium business houses as well as big enterprises
and government. Therefore, highly scalable and cost-effective

X. LIMITATIONS
In this section, we summarize the limitations we realized
through the comprehensive survey conducted in this work as
follows:
• Limited investigations on the interplay between MTD
and other defense mechanisms: We have discussed event-
based MTDs in Section III that describes the use of other
defense mechanisms (i.e., IDS and/or IPS) to determine
when to trigger an MTD operation and change attack
surface. However, an attacker can take advantage of a system
with a static and ﬁxed placement of the defense mechanisms.
Although one of MTD’s key roles is to assist other defense
mechanisms through cooperating with them, few prior work
have investigated the cooperative role [133, 32, 153]. These
approaches tackled the problem using an MTD approach
XI. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we conducted a comprehensive survey on
MTD techniques, their key classiﬁcations, their key design
dimensions, common attack behaviors handled by the existing
MTD approaches, and application domains considered in the
MTD literature. For the future research, we summarized the
insights and lessons obtained from this survey paper and
addressed the future research directions in the MTD research.
A. Insights & Lessons Learned
We obtained the following insights and lessons from this
study:
• Proactive, adaptive, and affordable defense: MTD takes
a non-conventional perspective toward security, which aims
to enhance security by changing the attack surface, rather
than eliminating all the vulnerabilities of system compo-
nents, representing the conventional security goal. Based on
this philosophy, MTD can provide a way to build proac-
tive, adaptive, and affordable defense mechanisms that can
leverage the existing technologies while enhancing system
security.
• Increased synergy in cooperation with other defense
mechanisms: By adding another layer of defense that can
proactively thwart potential attackers or hold inside attack-
ers’ actions, MTD can help an IDS detect intrusions more
effectively while providing an alternative defense strategy
to deal with vulnerabilities when deception is detected by
an attacker.
• Importance of balancing multiple objectives: Although
MTD introduces another layer of defense that can enhance
security, it also generates overhead and may interrupt ser-
vices to be provided to legitimate users. The thorough
analysis of critical tradeoffs between multiple objectives is
necessary to improve the state-of-the-art MTD technology.
• Customized MTD dealing with unique characteristics of
different application platforms: We noticed that different
types of MTD have been developed to deal with the unique
characteristics of different application domains in order to
fully leverage the advanced legacy technologies to maximize
the effectiveness and efﬁciency of MTD.
• Diverse solution techniques for developing MTD: Al-
though game theoretic MTD approaches are dominant
among all, other optimization techniques based on genetic
algorithms or machine learning have been explored.
• Validation of the performance of MTD with diverse met-
rics: The effectiveness and efﬁciency of MTD are measured
by using a variety of metrics in terms of the perspectives of
both an attacker and defender.
• Effective and efﬁcient evaluation methods developed
to ensure the veriﬁcation and validation (V&V) of
MTD: Most MTD approaches have been validated based on
simulation or analytical model-based experiments. But some
existing approaches conducted experiments under more re-
alistic environments using emulation or real-testbed based
evaluation methods.
Although we could obtain the insights and lessons from the
comprehensive survey conducted in this work, we felt the
future research should be geared toward the right direction.
We discuss the future research directions as below.
B. Future Research Directions
We suggest the following future research directions in the
MTD research domain:
• A better MTD classiﬁcation needs to be developed.
Although we used the operation-based MTD classiﬁcation
based on shufﬂing, diversity, and redundancy, it only cap-
tures ‘how-to-move.’ It does not capture other criteria such
as ‘when to move’ or ‘what to move.’ We need to develop
an MTD classiﬁcation that can comprehensively embrace
multi-dimensions of MTD properties which can provide a
better understanding of key MTD operations.

• More adaptive MTD mechanisms need to be developed.
In the state-of-the-art MTD technology, the concepts and
techniques of adaptive MTD are still immature. The adap-
tivity in triggering MTD operations can be achieved based
on the level of system vulnerabilities or attack patterns /
strength, which requires the advanced detection or learning
capability of the defender. How to learn an attacker’s action
and/or system security conditions is vital for the defender
to make decisions for the optimal MTD deployment.
• Lightweight MTD should be developed with high gran-
ularity of meeting the needs for highly contested envi-
ronments. MTD can be a good defense solution to protect
military tactical environments, where resources are often
severely restricted and communications between nodes are
fully distributed, requiring a fully autonomous decision
process. However, most MTD approaches addressed in the
state-of-the-art do not provide highly lightweight, distributed
solutions. Lightweight, secure MTD should be built to meet
multiple, conﬂicting objectives of the contested,
tactical
environments.
• More useful metrics are needed to maintain service avail-
ability to users. While MTD introduces enhanced security,
it may also hinder service availability to legitimate, normal
users. However, most metrics are focused on measuring
system security or attack success. Since the system has
multiple objectives to meet in terms of security, defense
cost, and service availability, there should be a balance
to develop meaningful, useful metrics that can capture the
impact introduced to users in terms of service quality.
• The effectiveness and efﬁciency of MTD should be
measured by system metrics embracing security, per-
formability, and economical costs introduced by the
MTD. As shown in Fig. 15, we can consider the three
metrics (i.e., security, performability, and economical cost)
to evaluate MTD techniques. Security metrics can measure
the effectiveness of the MTD while performability metrics
can estimate the efﬁciency of the MTD. Moreover,
the
economical costs introduced by using the MTD should
be considered particularly when MTD is implemented in
real systems. Hence, ﬁnding critical tradeoffs between these
three metrics should be investigated in the evaluation stage.
