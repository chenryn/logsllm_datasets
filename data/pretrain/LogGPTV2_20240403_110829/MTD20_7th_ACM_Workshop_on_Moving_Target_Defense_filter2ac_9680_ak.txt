### Measuring the Effectiveness of System Security

Several studies have attempted to evaluate the performability aspects of systems but have largely overlooked economic factors, such as operational and capital costs. In Section XI, we will discuss how the three key metrics—security, performability, and economic costs—can be integrated into a comprehensive evaluation framework.

### Lack of Realistic Testbeds

Most Moving Target Defense (MTD) approaches have been validated using analytical and simulation models, with few employing emulation-based or real testbed-based evaluation methods. This highlights a critical need for developing more robust experimental testbeds to verify and validate (V&V) the performance of various MTD techniques.

### Case Studies and Implementations

To investigate the impact of game strategies on platform migration and system security (e.g., mean time to compromise or MTTC), Sengupta et al. [132] developed a real-world MTD web application. This application can convert from Python to PHP and from MySQL to PostgreSQL, and vice versa, identifying an optimal solution through a real testbed.

**Figure 14** illustrates an example implementation architecture for MTD in cloud services, where server replicas within the cloud domain are shuffled [82].

### Pros and Cons of MTD in Cloud Environments

Newer cloud technologies have embraced the concept of infrastructure as code. Effective deployment of MTD techniques in clouds not only enhances security but also fosters innovation by leveraging dynamic configurations and infrastructure management. This makes MTD deployment feasible for small and medium-sized businesses, as well as large enterprises and government agencies. However, achieving a balance between security, performance, and cost remains a challenge, particularly in minimizing security vulnerabilities and defense costs while maximizing service availability.

### Limitations

In this section, we summarize the limitations identified through our comprehensive survey:

- **Limited Interplay Between MTD and Other Defense Mechanisms:** While event-based MTDs use other defense mechanisms (e.g., IDS and IPS) to trigger MTD operations, few studies have explored the cooperative role of MTD with these mechanisms. One of MTD's key roles is to assist other defenses, but prior work has not fully investigated this aspect [133, 32, 153].

### Conclusions

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of MTD techniques, their classifications, design dimensions, common attack behaviors, and application domains. We also outline future research directions based on the insights and lessons learned.

**A. Insights & Lessons Learned:**

- **Proactive, Adaptive, and Affordable Defense:** MTD offers a non-conventional approach to security, focusing on changing the attack surface rather than eliminating all vulnerabilities. This philosophy enables the development of proactive, adaptive, and affordable defense mechanisms.
- **Increased Synergy with Other Defense Mechanisms:** MTD adds another layer of defense, helping IDS detect intrusions more effectively and providing alternative strategies when deception is detected.
- **Balancing Multiple Objectives:** MTD introduces overhead and may interrupt services. A thorough analysis of trade-offs between security, defense costs, and service availability is necessary.
- **Customized MTD for Different Application Platforms:** Various MTD types have been developed to address the unique characteristics of different application domains, leveraging advanced legacy technologies.
- **Diverse Solution Techniques:** While game-theoretic MTD approaches are dominant, other optimization techniques based on genetic algorithms and machine learning have also been explored.
- **Validation with Diverse Metrics:** The effectiveness and efficiency of MTD are measured using a variety of metrics from both attacker and defender perspectives.
- **Effective and Efficient Evaluation Methods:** Most MTD approaches have been validated through simulation or analytical models, but some have used more realistic environments, such as emulation or real-testbed evaluations.

**B. Future Research Directions:**

- **Better MTD Classification:** Develop a more comprehensive MTD classification that captures multi-dimensional properties, including 'when to move' and 'what to move.'
- **More Adaptive MTD Mechanisms:** Improve the adaptivity of MTD operations based on system vulnerabilities and attack patterns, requiring advanced detection and learning capabilities.
- **Lightweight MTD for Contested Environments:** Develop lightweight, secure MTD solutions for highly contested environments, such as military tactical settings, where resources are severely restricted.
- **Useful Metrics for Service Availability:** Develop metrics that balance security, defense costs, and service availability to legitimate users.
- **System Metrics for MTD Evaluation:** Evaluate MTD techniques using metrics that consider security, performability, and economic costs, as illustrated in **Figure 15**.
