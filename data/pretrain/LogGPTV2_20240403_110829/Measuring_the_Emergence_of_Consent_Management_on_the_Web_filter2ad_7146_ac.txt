Table 1: Occurence of CMPs on websites in the Tranco 10k
measured from different vantage points.
YouTube videos to be shared more than mastercard.com. Hence
our sample exhibits a different coverage error than typical toplist-
based studies, which are not representative of the internet either.
Additionally, our choice of social media data feeds is heavily skewed
towards Western culture. We rectify this bias in part by grouping
captures by their effective second-level domain. In other words,
popular domains have a higher sampling frequency in our dataset,
but equal weight.
Missing Data. Another threat to validity is that some domains
in the toplist have never been shared on social media. This affects
1076 domains in the Tranco 10k list. Of these 1076 domains, 315
were not reachable via HTTP or HTTPS at all in our toplist mea-
surements, 4 did not return a valid HTTP response and 70 returned
an HTTP error status code. 192 domains redirected to another do-
main and were counted as the redirect target. The overwhelming
majority (> 90%) of the remaining 495 domains can be considered
internet infrastructure that is not directly accessed by users, such
as CDNs.
Subsites. In contrast to previous research, we crawl not only
a domain‚Äôs landing page but also arbitrary subsites given by the
seed URLs. This increases the reliability of our results as it allows
us to detect CMPs that are only present on specific subdomains
or subsites. However, we also encounter individual pages that do
not include a CMP. For example, some websites do not embed any
external scripts on their privacy policy page. As a simple heuristic,
we classify a website as using a CMP if the CMP is included in at
least every third capture. For 99.8% of all domains, the daily share
of CMP captures is either consistently below 5% or above 95%.
The remaining 0.2% of websites include a small set of larger web-
sites which change their behavior depending on the user‚Äôs location,
for example by complying with CCPA in the US but responding
with HTTP 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons to European
visitors.
Crawler Location. Netograph crawls all URLs from virtual ma-
chines rented from a large public cloud provider. Half of all captures
are done from the EU and the US respectively. This matches the
recommendations made by Van Eijk et al. [58] to perform crawls
from both inside and outside the EU for cookie consent notices. As
shown in Table 1, we observe significantly more CMP adoption
when crawling from the EU. This observation matches Van Eijk
et al.‚Äôs finding on vantage point difference and can be explained by
websites that only embed a CMP for EU visitors. Still, many web-
sites choose to always embed their CMP framework but configure
it to only show consent dialogs to EU visitors.
However, we found that not only the originating country, but
also the type of address space has a significant influence on mea-
surement results. As shown in Table 1, the use of public cloud
infrastructure makes us miss about 10% of all CMP dialogs in the
Tranco 10k. We manually inspected the sites in question and found
that this is predominantly caused by anti-bot interstitial pages of-
fered by popular CDNs. In contrast to the vantage point, the choice
of browser language settings did not have a significant effect on
our web measurements.
Lastly, we re-iterate our overall point that longitudinal measure-
ments matter for web privacy measurements: Looking at the same
measurements in January 2020 (see Table A.3), we see that only 70%
of CMP usage is visible in our measurements from the US. The rise
in coverage can be explained by the increasing adoption of CCPA
in recent months.
Crawler Timeouts. Due to the large volume of URLs, Netograph
runs crawls with relatively aggressive timeouts. To determine if
a page has finished loading, it looks at frame load events from
Chrome, the timing of requests, an idle timeout of five seconds and
a total page timeout of 45 seconds. We note that crawls are done
with heavy CPU utilization and a comparison with captures from
the desktop might not be apt. In any case, our approach differs from
smaller toplist-based measurements, which can afford much more
relaxed timeouts. We quantify this change in Table 1: The timeouts
employed by our measurement platform make us miss about 2% of
CMP usage.
Choice of Toplist. To determine website popularity, we used the
Tranco toplist [44]. Tranco aggregates results from other lists such
as the Alexa toplist, is hardened against manipulation, less sus-
ceptible to daily fluctuations, and emphasizes reproducibility by
providing permanent citable references. This decision is on line
with recent related work on cookie consent [32]. While Urban et al.
adapt the suggestion in the Tranco paper to remove all websites
with the same TLD+1 [55], we do not perform this in our case
as services may vary in their behavior across TLDs. For example,
amazon.com shows a different consent prompt than the EU version
of amazon.co.uk as of May 2020. A much more important factor
which previous work has not elaborated on is the choice of toplist
size. We show in the next section that different toplist sizes yield
significantly different results.
CMP Detection. We found our detection of CMPs to be robust
despite heterogeneous CMP implementations on different websites.
By looking at network traffic patterns we do not rely on any HTML
or DOM parsing, which we found to be much more unreliable
for analyses which we ultimately decided not to include in this
paper. In particular, network patterns often allow us to detect the
presence of CMPs even if the website‚Äôs CMP configuration does
not trigger a dialog, for example because we visit a EU-centric
website from the US or vice-versa. However, we acknowledge that
322

more about regulatory compliance than improving user experience.
However, events relevant to privacy law like fines or regulatory
guidance do not affect adoption. Quantcast‚Äôs solution is targeted
at GDPR and they achieved market dominance early on, but their
market growth slowed and was unaffected by the CCPA coming into
effect. In contrast, OneTrust became the market leader by offering
a flexible solution that could be tailored to the requirements of the
CCPA. This can be seen in the share of sites with a EU+UK TLD
for each CMP (Quantcast at 38.3% and OneTrust with 16.3%).

vation period (April 2018 to September 2020)
our detection accuracy and robustness is difficult to quantify. We
have manually evaluated patterns on other candidate domains,
patterns on specific HTTP requests, patterns on CSS selectors, and
patterns on extracted text to make sure that we do not miss any
CMP implementations. Additionally, we have used the Internet
Wayback Machine to validate that our patterns match correctly on
historic data. The only exception to this is a two-day period in July
2018 when Quantcast embedded parts of their CMP script for all
customers of their analytics service, a different line of the firm‚Äôs
business. We manually exclude this outlier in our calculations. We
overcount if a website includes more than one CMP, but this only
affects 0.01% of all captures.
4 RESULTS
This section is structured according to which part of the ecosystem
we are focusing on; websites and CMPs in Section 4.1, vendors in
Section 4.2, and the user-interface in Section 4.3
4.1 Measuring CMP Adoption
Figure 5 shows how CMP adoption varies across the Tranco top mil-
lion sites. The ùë¶-axis shows the percentage of firms embedding each
CMP provider in the toplist with size corresponding to the ùë•-axis.
None of the largest websites embed the CMPs under consideration,
likely because they have the in-house expertise to implement their
own consent management solution. Speaking to (I1), CMP adoption
is most prevalent among the 50 ‚àí 10, 000th websites, especially in
the top 1, 000 ‚àí 5, 000th sites. Adoption tails off slowly but never
vanishes.
Interestingly, we see that different firms penetrate different sec-
tions of the market. For example, more of the top 100 sites em-
bed Quantcast than the other CMP providers combined. However,
OneTrust has the most customers among the 500 ‚àí 50, 000th sites,
although Quantcast are more commonly adopted in the long tail.
Figure 6 shows how this has varied over time (I2). Laws like
GDPR and CCPA coming into effect were significant drivers in
CMP adoption, which suggests consent management solutions are

Our longitudinal approach can detect when websites change
CMPs. Figure 4 describes the resulting dynamics. Quantcast and
OneTrust both win and lose websites to each other. However, the
true loser of inter-CMP competition is Cookiebot who have lost
an order of magnitude more websites than they gained. The ap-
pendix contains further longitudinal insights by showing the CMP
marketshare in January 2019, January 2020, and September 2020
(respectively Figure A.4, A.5 and A.6). These three figures show
how OneTrust over-hauled the early market dominance established
by Quantcast.
We now turn to how publishers customize consent solutions (I3).
CMPs differ in how much customizability they extend to publishers,
we classify this into closed customization in which the publisher may
choose between finitely many options, and open customization in
which the publisher can choose infinitely many, such as via free-text
fields. In addition, publisher customization occurs when the website
implements consent management related functionality beyond that
offered by the CMP. We characterize the observed customization for
the three largest CMPs to illustrate the ways in which this varies.
All reported statistics are based on our measurements from an EU
university vantage point (see Table 1) where we have the browser‚Äôs
DOM tree and full page screenshots available for inspection.
Our sample includes 414 websites embedding OneTrust display-
ing a range of consent dialogues. The majority (61%) offer a con-
ventional cookie banner with a 1-click accept button and a second
button or link leading to a page with more information and fine-
grained controls. Only 2.4% of the sites display a cookie banner
containing an opt-out button with text like ‚ÄúDo Not Sell‚Äù, ‚ÄúRe-
ject/Manage Cookies‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDeny All‚Äù, although 40% of such banners
require further clicks to confirm the opt-out. A minority (5.5%) of
websites include a ‚Äòscript banner‚Äô (cookie banners in all but name)
with one ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù button and one ‚ÄúReject/Manage Scripts‚Äù button.
Rather than showing any banner, 7.5% of the websites in our sam-
ple included a link to cookie or privacy information in the website
footer. The link text was some variant of ‚ÄúDo Not Sell‚Äù, ‚ÄúCalifor-
nia Privacy Rights‚Äù, or ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù in 11, 15 and 4 websites
respectively. Two of the latter showed cookie banners only when
accessed from a US IP.
Quantcast‚Äôs dialogues are more standardized. Barriers contain
two buttons, the first of which allows the user to provide consent
to the publisher and partners in one click. Closed customizability
is offered as a choice between the second-button rejecting all or it
leading to a second page with more-fine grained options. Of the
233 websites embedding Quantcast in our sample, 55% offer a 1-
click reject all. The text on each button is an interesting example of
open-customization and we find that 87% use some variation of "I
agree/consent/accept", including non-English language translations.
The publishers who do not (13%) use free-form texts including
