### Initial Checks for Problem Determination

Before diving into detailed problem determination on various platforms, it is essential to consider whether there is an obvious cause of the problem or an area of investigation that is likely to yield useful results. This diagnostic approach can often save significant time and effort by highlighting a simple error or narrowing down the range of possibilities.

### Questions to Consider for Identifying the Cause of the Problem

Use the following questions as pointers to help you identify the cause of the problem:

1. **Has IBM MQ for z/OS run successfully before?**
   - If not, check your setup and verify the installation.
     - Ensure message CSQ9022I was issued in response to the `START QMGR` command.
     - Verify that z/OS displays IBM MQ as an installed subsystem using the `D OPDATA` command.
     - Check that the installation verification program (IVP) ran successfully.
     - Use the `DISPLAY DQM` command to check if the channel initiator address space is running and the appropriate listeners are started.

2. **Are there any error messages, return codes, or other error conditions?**
   - Investigate any error messages, return codes, and conditions where the queue manager or channel initiator terminated.
     - **CSQ Messages and Reason Codes:** Look for messages with the prefix CSQ.
     - **Other Messages:** Check for messages with different prefixes.
     - **Unusual Messages:** Be aware of unusual messages during startup or while the system was running.
     - **Application MQI Return Codes:** Check for return codes indicating failed MQI calls.

3. **Can you reproduce the problem?**
   - If so, consider the conditions under which it can be reproduced.
     - Is it caused by a command? If so, from where is the command issued?
     - Does the command work when entered by another method?
     - Is the command server running? Use the `DIS CMDSERV` command to check.
     - Is it caused by an application? If so, does it fail in CICS, IMS, TSO, or batch? Does it fail on all IBM MQ systems?

4. **Have you applied any APARs or PTFs?**
   - APARs and PTFs can occasionally cause unexpected problems.
     - Check for any error messages during the installation.
     - Ensure you have followed any instructions in the APAR that affect your system.

5. **Have any changes been made since the last successful run?**
   - Consider changes to IBM MQ, other programs, hardware, and new applications.
     - Has your initialization procedure changed?
     - Have you changed any queue definitions or security profiles?
     - Have you made any changes in your sysplex related to shared queues?
     - Has any software on your z/OS system been upgraded?
     - Has your z/OS subsystem name table been changed?
     - Do your applications handle new return codes introduced by changes?

6. **Has the application run successfully before?**
   - If the problem involves a specific application, consider its history.
     - Have any changes been made to the application since it last ran successfully?
     - Have all functions of the application been fully exercised?
     - Does the application check all return codes?
     - Does the application expect particular message formats?
     - Does the application use the `MQSET` call to change queue attributes?
     - Does the application handle messages that cause it to fail?

7. **Does the problem affect specific parts of the network?**
   - Identify specific parts of the network affected by the problem.
     - Check the connection between systems using the `MQSC PING CHANNEL` command.
     - Verify that messages are reaching the transmission queue.
     - Check for clustering definitions if using IBM MQ clusters.

8. **Does the problem occur at specific times of the day or affect specific users?**
   - If the problem occurs at specific times, it might be dependent on system loading.
   - If it affects specific users, check their security authorization.

9. **Is the problem intermittent or does it occur with all z/OS, CICS, or IMS systems?**
   - An intermittent problem could be due to processes running independently.
   - If the problem only occurs with specific systems, consider what is different about them.

10. **Do you have a program error?**
    - Common causes of problems include:
      - Failing to reset queue attributes after using `MQSET`.
      - Making incorrect assumptions about queue attributes.
      - Accessing queues without the correct security authorization.
      - Linking a program with no stub or the wrong stub.
      - Passing incorrect or invalid parameters in an MQI call.
      - Failing to define IBM MQ modules to z/OS correctly.
      - Failing to check return codes from MQI requests.
      - Failing to open objects with the correct options.
      - Failing to initialize `MsgId` and `CorrelId` correctly.
      - Using incorrect addresses.
      - Using storage before it has been initialized.
      - Passing variables with incorrect lengths.
      - Passing parameters in the wrong order.
      - Failing to define the correct security profiles and classes to RACF.
      - Relying on default MQI options for ported applications.
      - Relying on default behavior at a normal or abnormal end of a portal application.

### Additional Questions for Deeper Investigation
- **Have you received some incorrect output?**
  - When to classify output as incorrect.
  - Error messages from IBM MQ.
- **Have you received an unexpected error message or return code?**
- **Has there been an abend?**
- **Have you received no response from an MQSC command?**
- **Is there a problem with the IBM MQ queues?**
- **Are some of your queues working?**
- **Are the correct queues defined?**
- **Does the problem affect only remote or cluster queues?**
- **Does the problem affect only shared queues?**
- **Is your application or IBM MQ for z/OS running slowly?**
- **Has your application or IBM MQ for z/OS stopped processing work?**
