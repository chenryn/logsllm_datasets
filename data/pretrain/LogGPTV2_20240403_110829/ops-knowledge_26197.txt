User: Please design a set of security policies for servers and systems to ensure that the systems are not subject to malicious attacks and data leakage.
Assistant: 1. Strengthen password policy: Require users to use strong passwords and change passwords regularly, disable weak passwords, such as "123456", "qwerty" and other simple passwords, limit the number of failed logins, and limit the number of password attempts. 2. Hardware security: The server should be installed in a safe computer room, and only authorized personnel can access it. Access control systems, security systems, surveillance cameras and other measures provide additional protection. 3. Operating system and software update: Ensure that the operating system and all software on the server are the latest versions, and fix vulnerabilities in time. 4. Firewall: Install and configure all the functions of the firewall, such as flow control, port filtering, preventing DoS and DDoS attacks, etc. 5. Rights management: Set appropriate rights control on the server to ensure that users can only access their own files and data, and set only necessary rights. 6. Data backup: back up data regularly and set up offline storage devices to avoid data loss or damage. 7. Log management: Monitor server logs and set up an early warning system to notify administrators immediately when abnormal behavior or attacks are found. 8. Security Center: Establish a security center, arrange special personnel to handle and manage security incidents, and conduct security training. 9. Strengthen security access: restrict remote access to the server, and implement access control and encryption processing on the server to avoid the risk of data leakage due to unauthorized access.
