### Source code
  * I provided exact source code that allows reproducing the issue locally.
  * detailed logs attached
In Firefox only (not Chromium, Webkit), a click action fails with a timeout
because something in the browser seems to crash.  
The click leads to a navigation, with a redirect. That succeeds, I can see
that in headed mode. But Playwright apparently does not get a success message
back from the browser, and times out.
During a test, I use the button (a logout button) multiple times, and it does
not fail on the first time, but on some subsequent one; but reproducibly on
always the same! This maybe suggests that it's not a race, but some other
underlying problem.
The clicking code:
    accountMenu.locator("button[role='menuitem']:has-text('power_settings_new')").click(
            new Locator.ClickOptions().setNoWaitAfter(true)
        );
where `accountMenu` is another `Locator`.
I am always in headed mode (cannot use headless because I use WebGL, which
doesn't work in headless Firefox).
Logs starting from the click, the timeout is 15s, which you can see that the
click is reported as failed after that time, although I can see that the
navigation worked.

    2023-06-27T14:49:04.675Z pw:api <= Frame.click failed
I added `noWaitAfter: true` to the click, but it didn't help (the logs are
from the run with noWaitAfter=true).  
Using a `slowMo` of 0 or 100 triggers the problem at exactly the same click
(the 3rd time within one test). Using a value of 500 triggers it at a later
time (I use the button to log out many times during a test).
I cannot share the source of the page/server, it is an internal project.
