**Abstract:**
Packet delay and loss are fundamental performance metrics in packet networks. Active probing, often using Poisson probes, is a common method to measure these metrics. The PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property ensures that Poisson probing yields unbiased estimates. However, recent work has challenged the utility of PASTA, showing that other processes can also provide unbiased estimates and that Poisson probing does not necessarily minimize the variance of delay estimates.

In this paper, we determine optimal probing processes that minimize the mean-square error of measurement estimates for both delay and loss. Our contributions are twofold:
1. We show that Gamma renewal probing processes have optimal properties in terms of bias and variance, assuming the target process (e.g., loss or delay) has a convex auto-covariance function.
2. We use empirical datasets to demonstrate the applicability of our results in practice, confirming that the convexity condition holds and that Gamma probing outperforms Poisson probing.

These results provide explicit guidelines for designing the best probe streams for both delay and loss estimation.

## 1. Introduction

In packet networks, packet loss and delay are key performance metrics. They are particularly important in end-to-end measurements, where they can be used to infer network parameters such as link capacities and available bandwidth. Measuring loss is more challenging than measuring delay because loss data is binary and less informative. Traditional methods for loss measurement involve sending isolated probes and estimating average loss probability from the observed loss rate.

More sophisticated techniques for delay measurements, such as using probe trains, have been proposed. However, analogous techniques for loss are limited by the rarity of multiple losses in a train. Typically, active probing for delay and loss uses Poisson probes based on the PASTA property, which ensures unbiased estimates. Recent work has questioned the optimality of Poisson probing, showing that other processes can also provide unbiased estimates with lower variance.

This paper addresses the general question of optimal probing strategies for both delay and loss. We provide rigorous results on probing strategies using a network model that includes multiple hops and varying loss mechanisms. Our findings include:
- A theorem on minimizing variance with wide applicability.
- An explicit family (Gamma renewal) of probing streams that outperform Poisson probing in terms of variance while maintaining zero sample path bias.

We also provide experimental evidence from empirical datasets to support our theoretical results.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows:
- Section 2 provides background information on sampling for delay and loss.
- Section 3 presents theorems on optimal variance for delay and loss estimation.
- Sections 4 and 5 provide extensive measurement results.
- Section 7 compares our work with related research.
- Section 8 concludes the paper.

## 2. Overview

### 2.1 The Ground Truth Process

To measure loss, we define the ground truth as a binary stochastic process \( I_x(t) \), which takes value 1 if a packet of size \( x \) injected at time \( t \) would be lost, and 0 otherwise. This process is stationary, and the marginal loss probability \( p_x = P(I_x(t) = 1) \) is constant over time.

For example, in a one-hop path model with a finite FIFO buffer and droptail policy, the loss process is given by:
\[ I_x(t) = 1\{B(t) + x > K\}, \]
where \( B(t) \) is the buffer occupancy and \( K \) is the buffer size. In a two-hop tandem network, the loss process is:
\[ I_x(t) = 1\{B(t) + x > K\} + 1\{B(t) + x \leq K, B_2(t + d_x(t)) + x > K_2\}, \]
where \( d_x(t) = \frac{B(t) + x}{C} \) is the delay over the first buffer, \( C \) is the bandwidth, and \( K_2 \) is the size of the second buffer.

Similarly, for delay, the ground truth process \( D_x(t) \) represents the delay experienced by a packet of size \( x \) injected at time \( t \).

### 2.2 Sampling and Intrusiveness

Probing involves two main issues: sampling and intrusiveness. Sampling concerns the discrete times at which probes can observe the network state, while intrusiveness refers to the perturbation caused by real probes. This paper focuses on non-intrusive sampling, where the goal is to minimize variance without perturbing the network.

In [2], the NIMASTA (Non-Intrusive Mixing Arrivals See Time Averages) property was introduced, which ensures that mixing probe processes yield unbiased estimates. Mixing is a strong form of ergodicity that guarantees joint ergodicity between the probe and ground truth processes. The NIMASTA property is desirable in active probing, where only a single sample path is available.

### 2.3 NIMASTA

NIMASTA states that for a stationary and ergodic ground truth process and a stationary and mixing probe point process, the empirical averages of the probe observations converge almost surely to the true mean value of the ground truth process:
\[ \lim_{N \to \infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N f(X(T_n)) = E[f(X(0))]. \]

In [2], this property was proved for virtual probes and extended to arbitrary ground truth processes. Mixing is necessary for strong consistency, and periodic sampling, for example, can lead to phase-lock phenomena and sample-path bias.

## 3. Sampling for Optimal Variance

### 3.1 The Convexity Condition

We denote the ground truth continuous-time stochastic process by \( X(t) \), with mean \( \mu \) and auto-covariance function:
\[ R(\tau) = E[X(t)X(t + \tau)] - \mu^2. \]

We focus on networks where the auto-covariance function \( R(\tau) \) is convex for \( \tau \geq 0 \). Under this condition, we prove that Poisson probing is suboptimal in terms of variance, and Gamma renewal probing processes achieve near-optimal variance.

The usual sample mean estimator of \( \mu \) using \( N \) samples is:
\[ \hat{\mu}_1 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^N X(T_n). \]

Our main result is that under the convexity condition, Gamma renewal probing processes outperform Poisson probing in terms of variance while maintaining zero sample path bias.

[Insert Figure 1 here]

This figure, taken from [2], shows an example of ergodic probe processes, one of which (the Periodic case) is not mixing. The lack of mixing leads to phase-lock phenomena and sample-path bias, even though the estimator remains unbiased.

In this paper, we employ probes satisfying the mixing property to ensure strong consistency and examine optimal probing through an analysis of variance within this framework.
