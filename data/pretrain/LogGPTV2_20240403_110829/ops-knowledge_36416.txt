User: How to implement SSL-based HTTPS protocol support on Nginx? Please provide detailed configuration method.
Assistant: To implement SSL-based HTTPS protocol support, the following configurations are required: 1. To apply for an SSL certificate, you first need to apply for an SSL certificate from an SSL certificate authority or a self-built certificate authority. Generally, there are two types: free and paid. Select the appropriate certificate and follow the guidelines to apply, download, and save it. 2. Configure Nginx Then you need to perform related configurations on the Nginx server. First enter the configuration file directory of Nginx, and create a new file in it as the certificate storage location. For example: ``` sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/certs sudo chmod 700 /etc/nginx/certs ``` Then upload the applied certificate to this directory: ``` sudo scp example.crt example.key root@ your_server_ip:/etc/nginx/certs ``` Then add the following to the Nginx configuration file: ``` server { listen 443 ssl; server_name your_domain.com; ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/example.crt; ssl_certificate_key /etc /nginx/certs/example.key; ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5; } ``` Among them, the listen directive specifies the HTTPS protocol port as 443, the ssl_certificate directive specifies the certificate path, and the ssl_protocols directive Specifies the supported TLS protocol version, and the ssl_ciphers directive specifies the supported encryption algorithms. Then restart the Nginx service: ``` sudo systemctl restart nginx ``` 3. Configure the firewall In order to allow HTTPS requests to access normally, you also need to add firewall rules to allow the HTTPS protocol to pass. You can use the following command to add rules: ``` sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full' ``` Just replace Nginx in the above command with your own firewall name. 4. Verify that it is normal Finally, use a browser to visit your domain name to confirm whether you can access your website through the HTTPS protocol, and a green lock is displayed in the address bar, indicating that the SSL certificate has taken effect. The above is the detailed configuration method for implementing SSL-based HTTPS protocol support on Nginx.
