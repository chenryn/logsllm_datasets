# VISIBLE: A Video-Assisted Key Inference Attack Framework

## Impact of Environmental Factors

We also evaluated the impact of various environmental factors on the performance of VISIBLE.

### a. Different Light Conditions
Our attack relies on analyzing video recordings of the tablet's backside during the victim's typing process. The quality of these videos is influenced by lighting conditions. Generally, low-light conditions lead to increased video noise, streaking, blurred motion, and poor focus. We conducted key inference experiments under two light conditions: 400 lux (normal) and 180 lux (low light). Figure 14 shows the key inference results for each key. As expected, the key inference accuracy decreases slightly as the light condition changes from 400 lux to 180 lux. However, the key inference result under 180 lux remains quite acceptable, highlighting the wide applicability of VISIBLE in low-light conditions.

### b. Different Angles Between Camcorders and the Tablet
The performance of VISIBLE is also affected by the angles between the camcorders and the tablet. In previous experiments, the angle was 90 degrees. We changed the angle to 60 and 30 degrees while keeping the distance between the camcorders and the tablet unchanged. The experimental results are shown in Figure 15, which displays the key inference accuracy for one-hop, two-hop, and three-hop neighbors. 

In each of the three subfigures, 90 and 60-degree angles lead to similar key inference accuracy, which is better than that of the 30-degree angle. This is because each camcorder has a specific Depth of Field (DOF), which is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. If the angle between the camcorders and the tablet is 90 or 60 degrees, all Areas of Interest (AOIs) are within the DOF, allowing clear recording of their motions. However, if the angle is too small, the camcorders cannot contain all AOIs within their DOF, leading to blurred images and inaccurate estimation of tablet backside motions. If the angle must be small due to practical constraints, the attacker can use multiple camcorders to record the motions of different AOIs to obtain sharp images of each AOI.

### c. Imperfect Reconstruction of the Attack Scenario
As mentioned in Section V-B, a successful key inference attack requires the attacker to reconstruct the attack scenario based on recorded images. However, the reconstructed layout cannot be exactly the same as the true layout. We evaluated the impact of imperfect reconstruction of the attack scenario by randomly changing the location of the camcorders by five centimeters and the position of the tablet by three centimeters, then re-running the key inference experiment. Figure 14 shows the key inference accuracy when the attack scenario is not perfectly reconstructed. The key inference accuracy for each key is only slightly lower than that under perfect reconstruction, demonstrating the robustness of VISIBLE against small environmental changes. Note that attack scenario reconstruction is fully controlled by the attacker and does not involve the victim. Its accuracy depends only on the quality of the recorded images, and we expect the reconstructed attack scenario to be accurate in practice.

If the environment changes significantly during video recording, such as the victim changing position or moving the tablet more than 10 centimeters, the attacker may need to launch a new round of attacks to obtain accurate inference results.

## Experiments on a Google Nexus 7 Tablet
To demonstrate the universality of VISIBLE, we also conducted experiments on a Google Nexus 7 tablet with a 7-inch touchscreen, which is smaller than that of an iPad 2. Backside motion estimation on the Nexus 7 is easier for two reasons:
1. The size of the Nexus 7 is smaller, allowing us to video-record the clear tablet backside motion with only one camcorder.
2. The Nexus 7’s backside has more texture information (e.g., logo and dots), enabling motion estimation at more parts of the tablet backside.

- (c) Three-hop accuracy.

Figure 16 compares the performance of VISIBLE on a Google Nexus 7 tablet with Android 4.4 and an iPad 2 tablet with iOS 8. The key inference accuracy of VISIBLE is similar on both tablets, indicating that VISIBLE is applicable to smaller-size tablets as long as there are sufficient areas with texture information on the tablet backside. Additionally, the performance on the Nexus 7 is slightly better than that on the iPad 2 due to the richer texture information on the Nexus 7’s backside, which allows for more accurate motion extraction.

## Conclusion, Countermeasures, and Future Work

In this paper, we proposed VISIBLE, a video-assisted key inference attack framework to infer the victim’s typing content based on video recordings of the tablet backside. We used complex steerable pyramid decomposition to capture subtle motions on the tablet backside and employed machine learning techniques to infer the typed keys, words, and sentences. Our extensive experiments demonstrated that VISIBLE can achieve high key inference accuracy for both PIN and alphabetical soft keyboards and correctly infer the victim’s typed words or sentences with very high probability.

### Possible Countermeasures
1. **Large Featureless Cover:** Design a large featureless cover to cover the stand or the tablet to prevent the attacker from finding useful AOIs in the recorded video.
2. **Randomized Keyboard Layouts:** Randomize the layouts of the PIN and alphabetical soft keyboards, making it difficult for the attacker to recover the typed keys even if they can infer the keystroke positions on the touchscreen. This defense may sacrifice user experience.
3. **On-Board Vibrators:** Generate vibrations during the typing process to mask the motions caused by the user’s typing. However, most current commercial off-the-shelf tablets do not have on-board vibrators.
4. **Covering the Whole Tablet:** Cover both the front and back sides of the tablet, though this solution is inconvenient and might be socially awkward.

### Future Work
- **Higher Resolutions and Frame Rates:** Test VISIBLE with more advanced camcorders to capture more detailed texture information and motion details.
- **Impact of Optical and Digital Zoom:** Investigate the impact of optical and digital zoom and the distance between the camcorder and the victim’s tablet.
- **Upper-Case Letters, Punctuation, and Key Combinations:** Extend the study to include more content types.
- **Hand-Held Scenarios:** Investigate keystroke inference when the tablet is held by hand, which introduces additional challenges due to the time-varying motion of the holding hand.
- **Unified and Normalized Model:** Develop a model that can automatically transfer motions video-recorded in different distances and angles to a unified and normalized distance and angle, improving the convenience of launching the attack.
