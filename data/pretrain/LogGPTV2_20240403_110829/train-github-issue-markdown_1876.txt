It appears that the Translation Component is present but not functioning correctly. For example, when I intentionally throw an exception, I receive hundreds of warnings stating `WARNING - Translation not found.` This issue did not occur prior to the upgrade to version 2.6.x.

This component is currently in use within the Zikula project and is being developed in a complete development mode. Additionally, we are experiencing composer-related issues since the upgrade to 2.6.x.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
