It appears that the Translation Component is present, but failing to operate
properly. For example if I intentionally throw an exception, I get hundreds of
rows saying `WARNING - Translation not found.`
this was not true before the upgrade to 2.6.x
this is in use in the Zikula project and in complete dev mode at the moment.
We are also have composer issues since the changeover to 2.6.x
any help is appreciated.
