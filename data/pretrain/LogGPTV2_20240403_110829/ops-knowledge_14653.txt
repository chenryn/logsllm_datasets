User: I have this program that at one point accesses os.getcwd(), but some times, depending on where the program has gone before getting to that line, it crashes with the message "OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory". 
I cannot figure out what i can do wrong then calling os.getcwd(). There's no arguments, and there should always be a current working directory, right?
Assistant: You would get that error if your current directory no longer exists (it is deleted).
