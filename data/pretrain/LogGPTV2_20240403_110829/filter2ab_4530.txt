**ATT&CK ID:** M1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Behavior Prevention on Endpoint

To enhance security and prevent malicious activities, implement the following measures on Windows 10 and 11:

1. **Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) Rules:**
   - On Windows 10, enable ASR rules to prevent applications from writing signed, vulnerable drivers to the system. This helps mitigate the risk of such drivers being exploited by attackers.

2. **Enable Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist:**
   - On both Windows 10 and 11, enable the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. This feature helps harden the system against potentially malicious or vulnerable third-party service drivers, thereby reducing the attack surface.

By implementing these measures, you can significantly improve the security posture of your endpoints and protect them from a range of potential threats.
