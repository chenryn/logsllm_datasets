User: I want to run a process in a loop and if the process returns 0, I must rerun it. If it aborts, I have to capture its stack trace (backtrace). I'm using subprocess.Popen() and .communicate() to run the process. Now .returncode is 134, i.e. child has received SIGABRT, is there any way I can capture the backtrace (stack trace) of child?
Since this is a testing tool, I have to capture all the necessary information before I forward it to dev team.
Assistant: What you can do is to redirect stdout and stderr of your subprocess.Popen() to a file and later on check that.
Doing like that it should be possible to check the backtrace later the "process Termination".
Good logging mechanism will give you that :-) Hope this help enough.
