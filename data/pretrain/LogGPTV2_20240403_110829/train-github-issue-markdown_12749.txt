For the one who will tag this issue: Affects **Linux** version. Likely is a
bug. Causes a crash.
I'm not sure where the issue is, but since it's Atom that crashes as a result,
I assume I should report it here. If it turns out to be issue somewhere else,
I'll take my time to report it in the appropriate place.
### Software involved
  1. Firefox Developer Edition 40.0a2 (installed from Firefox Aurora PPA as `firefox`)
  2. Atom 0.210.0 (installed from Webupd8 PPA)
  3. Linux Mint 17.1 Rebecca, XFCE edition, fully updated and with XFCE 4.12
Not sure if the last one is important, I'll add others to the list or remove
the point altogether if the specific Linux distro turns out to be irrelevant.
### Steps to reproduce:
  1. Run Firefox and open some tabs
  2. Run Atom in safe mode to isolate the issue (I used `atom --safe .` from terminal)
  3. Grab one of the Firefox' tabs and drag it over the Atom's window, not releasing the mouse button
**Result** : Atom crashes, outputting the following into the terminal:

    The program 'atom' received an X Window System error.
    This probably reflects a bug in the program.
    The error was 'BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)'.
      (Details: serial 1312 error_code 5 request_code 20 minor_code 0)
      (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
       that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
       To debug your program, run it with the --sync command line
       option to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
       backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)
