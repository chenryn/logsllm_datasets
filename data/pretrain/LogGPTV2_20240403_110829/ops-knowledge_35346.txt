User:  On the Azure cloud platform, how to configure virtual networks and security groups to ensure the safe and reliable operation of applications?
Assistant: The following are the steps to configure the virtual network and security group on the Azure cloud platform to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the application: 1. Create a virtual network (Virtual Network) A virtual network is a network used to host resources such as virtual machines and load balancers on the Azure platform solution. To create a virtual network, you need to specify parameters such as network address space, subnet, and routing table, and select resources to associate with it. 2. Verify network security After creating a virtual network, you can use the Network Security Group (Network Security Group) to verify the security of the network. Network security groups are rule-managed network filters that can be used to control traffic to and from a virtual network. Inbound/outbound rules can be created specifying which traffic to allow or deny. 3. Configure network security groups to enhance security. Network security groups can be used to restrict network traffic, such as restricting inbound traffic, allowing only data packets from specific IP address ranges, TCP/UDP port numbers, protocols, etc. Outbound traffic can also be restricted to ensure sensitive data is not leaked. 4. Use Azure Application Gateway (Application Gateway) to further enhance security Azure Application Gateway is a load balancer managed according to strict security rules, can be routed according to traffic characteristics, and provides SSL termination, based on Web application firewall (WAF) security, etc. To sum up, on the Azure cloud platform, configuring virtual networks and security groups (including internal network and outgoing network) is an important measure to improve network security. Especially when critical applications are hosted in virtual networks, it is necessary to implement strict network security protection measures.
