use,  namely  those  of  the  Dolev-Yao  and 
Byzantine adversaries. I illustrate this with 
adversaries  that  attack  perfectly  sensible

networks.  These  attacks  cannot  be

Abstract  
Invariably,  new 
introduce 
new  vulnerabilities  which  often  enable 
new  attacks  by 
increasingly  potent 
adversaries.  Yet  new  systems  are  more 
adept  at  handling  well-known  attacks  by 
old  adversaries 
than  anticipating  new 
ones.  Our  adversary  models  seem  to  be 
perpetually  out  of  date:  often  they  do  not 
capture adversary attacks and sometimes 
they address attacks rendered impractical 
by new technologies. 
       In this talk, I provide a brief overview 
of adversary models beginning with those 
required  by  program  and  data  sharing 
technologies  ('60-'70s),  continuing  with
