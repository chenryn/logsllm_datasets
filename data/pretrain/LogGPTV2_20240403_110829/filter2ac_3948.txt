**ATT&CK ID:** C0024  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** SolarWinds Compromise

During the SolarWinds compromise, APT29 leveraged Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) administrative permissions to alter domain federation trust settings. Specifically, they configured the targeted domains to accept authorization tokens signed with their own Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) signing certificate. This manipulation allowed the threat actors to generate and use fraudulent SAML tokens, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the affected systems. [5][6]
