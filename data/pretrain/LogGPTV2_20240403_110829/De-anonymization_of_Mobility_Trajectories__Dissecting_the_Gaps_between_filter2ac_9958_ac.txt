the largest online review service in China. Dianping has similar
features as the Yelp and Foursquare combined. It also uses
HTTP for its mobile app and the user ID is visible to ISP.
Following the same procedure, our ISP collaborator marked
Dianping sessions in the ISP traces within the same time
window April 19–26 in 2016. This produced an external GPS
dataset of 45,790 matched users. Each location trajectory is
characterized by a user’s Dianping ID, and a series of GPS
coordinates with timestamps.
Similarly, the Dianping ID is only visible to the ISP col-
laborator. The ID has been replaced by an encrypted bitstream
in our dataset. A mapping between the bitstream and the
anonymized ISP user ID is provided to us. We have also
notiﬁed Dianping Inc. about our research plan and received
their consent.
D. Data Processing
The collected datasets have different formats and precision
in terms of the time and location. We seek to format the data
in a consistent manner before our evaluation.
Converting Basestation ID to GPS.
To construct user
mobility traces from the ISP data, we ﬁrst convert the ID of
base stations to their geographical coordinates (longitudes and
latitudes) based on the ISP offered database, and use it to
represent the user location.
Building Trajectories.
Since the timestamps have different
resolutions in different datasets, we build the trajectory based
on discrete time intervals. More speciﬁcally, we divide the time
span of a user’s trace into many ﬁxed sized time bins. Then, we
add one location data point to each time bin to build the vector
Su and Lv. To systematically match GPS locations across
datasets, we also map the GPS coordinates into regions with a
certain spatial resolution. More speciﬁcally, we use a similar
method from [32], [33]. The idea is dividing the whole city into
grids, where each grid represents a “region”. Different regions
do not overlap with each other. In this way, we use a tuple
of a time bin and a location region to consistently represent a
location record. After the data processing, we deﬁne T and R
as the set of all the time bins and the set of all the spatial
regions, respectively. These above steps introduce two key
parameters to adjust the temporal and spatial resolutions of
the dataset. By default, we set the time bin as 1 hour, and
the spatial resolution as 1 km. In the later analysis, we will
also test different temporal and spatial resolutions to assess the
inﬂuence to our results and conclusions.
E. Ethics
We have taken active steps to preserve the privacy of
involved users in our datasets. First, all the data collected for
this study was kept within a safe data warehouse server (behind

Complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the
a company ﬁrewall). We have never taken any fragment of the
dataset away from the server. Second, the ISP employee (our
collaborator) anonymized all the user identiﬁers, including the
unique identiﬁers of cellular network users, and the actual IDs
of Weibo and Dianping users. Speciﬁc steps (e.g., crawling
Weibo check-ins) that require unencrypted Weibo/Dianping
IDs were performed by the ISP employee. After obtaining
the target trajectory datasets, the ISP employee removed the
actual IDs from the datasets, and associated each entry with an
encrypted bitstream. The mapping between the bitstream and
the anonymized cellular user identiﬁer is provided to us. The
real user IDs are never made available to, or utilized by us. All
our data processing was fully governed by the ISP employee to
ensure compliance with the commitments of privacy stated in
the Term-of-Use statements. Third, we obtained the approval
for using the Weibo data and Dianping data from the Data and
Engineering team of Weibo and Dianping, under the condition
that the data is processed strictly following the above steps
and can only be used for research. Finally, our research plan
has been approved by our local institutional board.
We believe through our work, we can provide more com-
prehensive understandings on the privacy risks of users when
anonymized ISP trajectory data is shared. The results will
help the stakeholders to make more informed decisions on
designing privacy policies to protect user privacy in the long
run.
F. Preliminary Data Analysis
Fig. 1 and Table III shows the basic statistics of the three
datasets. The ISP dataset is the largest one with 2,161,500
users. The Weibo dataset (app level), as the external infor-
mation source, has 56,683 users, which is about 3% of the
IPS user population. This indicates that using this external
information, the adversary still faces non-trivial noises to re-
identify the target users. Compared to other datasets, the ISP
dataset covers a bigger portion of a user’s mobility trace with
a higher average number of records and distinct locations
per user (62.1 and 9.19). The Weibo and Dianping datasets
(app level) are sparse with 4.22 and 2.34 records per user
respectively. The Weibo check-in datasets cover both the
same time-window as other datasets (Synchronized) as well
as the historical check-ins of the users (Historical). Not too
surprisingly, the check-in dataset is even sparser. Overall, the
4 external trajectory datasets from 2 different online services
provide a diverse and large collection of user trajectories with
a ground truth mapping to the ISP dataset. This helps to solve
the critical problem of lacking ground truth data in the existing
works [9], [32].

V. DE-ANONYMIZATION IN PRACTICE
Based on the above three large-scale datasets, we investi-
gate the potential privacy leakage of the ISP trajectory dataset.
In order to show the theoretical bound of privacy leakage, we
ﬁrst investigate the uniqueness of trajectories in Section V-A.
Then, comparing with the theoretical bound, we implement
7 existing de-anonymization algorithms in practice, and show
their performance in Section V-B.
A. Theoretical Privacy Bound
Uniqueness of trajectory in an anonymity mobility dataset
is a well-recognized metric to measure the privacy bound and
the de-anonymization risks [9], [18], [40]. In 1930, Edmond
Locard showed that 12 points are sufﬁcient to uniquely identify
a ﬁngerprint [9], [13]. Similarly, the analysis of the uniqueness
of trajectories is to estimate the number of points necessary to
uniquely identify the mobility trace of an individual.
The uniqueness metric is computed as follows. Let Tp
denote a sub-trajectory of a user with p randomly selected
spatio-temporal points. Then we search for other trajectories in
the dataset that match or contain the p points of Tp. We deﬁne
the matched trajectories as the user’s anonymity set denoted as
A(Tp). Then the user’s uniqueness is characterized by |A(Tp)|,
i.e., the number of matched trajectories in the anonymity set.
Intuitively, the uniqueness metric estimates how likely a user
can be re-identiﬁed if an external adversary observed a random
p points in her trace. If |A(Tp)| = 1, its anonymity set only
contains one trace, i.e., trajectory of its true owner. This means
the p points can uniquely re-identify the user.
Note that the above trajectory matching is based on both
location and time. We consider two data points match if they
fall into the same location region and time bin (we deﬁned
the location region and time bin in §IV-D). For example, if
two trajectories show users visiting the same locations in the
same order but at different times, they are not the same. The
uniqueness metric is the very basic metric to quantify the
de-anonymization risk. More sophisticated metric can further
consider the location context (e.g., user density in a given area)
and the time context (e.g., day and night patterns) [9].
We evaluate the uniqueness of trajectories in different
datasets as the function of p. The results are shown in Fig. 2.
As we can observe from Fig. 2(b) and (c), uniqueness of
trajectories in Weibo app-level and check-in dataset are both
very high, e.g., 5 points can uniquely identify over 90% users.
Results are similar for the Dianping dataset (the ﬁgure is
omitted for brevity). The high uniqueness of these two types
of external information guarantees their high ability to de-
anonymize the ISP trajectory dataset. On the other hand, from
Fig. 2(a), we can observe that the uniqueness of ISP trajectories
is a bit lower. The main reason is that the number of ISP
trajectories is signiﬁcantly larger, e.g., 38 times larger than the
number of Weibo app-level trajectories. Such large quantity
of the data makes individuals better hidden in the crowd.
Nevertheless, the uniqueness of ISP trajectories is also high,
i.e., 5 points can uniquely identify over 75% users, indicating
their potential high risk to be de-anonymized.
In addition, we analyze the inﬂuence of the spatio-temporal
resolutions on the uniqueness. We ﬁx the number of spatio-
temporal points as 5, and the obtained results for the ISP

Their similarity score is deﬁned as
the number of meeting events as follow:
DME =
I(S(t) = L(t)).
(cid:88)
t∈T
POIS:
Riederer et al. [31] mainly consider using the
“encountering” events to match the same users. They assume
the number of visits of each user to a location during a
time period follows Poisson distribution, and an action (e.g.
login) on each service occurs independently with Bernoulli
distribution. Based on this mobility model,
the algorithm
computes a score for every candidate pair of trajectories, which
can be calculated as follows,
DPOIS(Su, Lv) =
φr,t(Su(t), Lv(t)),
(cid:88)
(cid:88)
t∈T
r∈R
where φ measures the importance of an “encountering” event
in location r at time slot t, and can be given as follows,
P (Su(t) = r, Lv(t) = r|σ(u) = v)
φr,t(Su(t), Lv(t)) =
.
P (Su(t) = r)P (Lv(t) = r)
It can be calculated based on their mobility model with the
assumptions of Poisson visits and Bernoulli actions.
NFLX:
Narayanan et al. [28] propose a de-anonymization
algorithm that can tolerate some mistakes in the adversary’s
knowledge. In order to adapt this algorithm to the trajectory
data, we use the similarity score modiﬁed by [31], which is
deﬁned as follows:

dataset. As shown in Fig. 3, the uniqueness measure is not
very sensitive to the spatio-temporal resolution (log scale x-
axis). Reducing the temporal resolution from 30 minutes to
4 hours only leads to the decreasing of uniqueness by 20%,
while reducing the spatial resolution from 250m to 1km only
leads to the decreasing of uniqueness by 26%. The resolution
degradation is likely to hurt the usability of the dataset which
only brings in a little privacy beneﬁt in exchange.
In summary,
the obtained user trajectories are highly
unique. Even when the spatial granularity is very low, 5 points
are sufﬁcient to uniquely identify over 75% users, indicating
the high potential risk of individual
trajectories to be de-
anonymized, which exposes a big threat to users’ privacy.
B. Actual Performance of Attack Methods
To examine the effectiveness of de-anonymization attacks,
we implement 7 major attacking algorithms discussed in the
Section II. We focus on algorithms that are designed (or can
be adopted) to work on trajectory datasets.
HMM:
Shokri et al. [33] focus on de-anonymizing users’
trajectories based on their mobility patterns. Speciﬁcally, they
train a Markov model to describe the mobility of users, which
is represented by the transition matrix T v. They also deﬁne a
function f : R × R → R to describe the spatial mismatching
between the adversary’s knowledge and users’ true locations.
After using Lv to estimate T v, the similarity score can be
calculated by:
DHMM = P (Su|T v) =
f (Z(t), S(t))T v

Naini et al. [27] focus on de-anonymization by
matching the histograms of trajectories. Speciﬁcally, they use
Γu to denote the histogram of user u deﬁned as Γu(r) =
