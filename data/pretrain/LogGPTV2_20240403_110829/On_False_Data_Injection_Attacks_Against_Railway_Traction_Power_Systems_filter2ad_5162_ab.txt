This control law is illustrated in Fig. 2a. Speciﬁcally, if the
nodal voltage at the train is greater than the triggering volt-
age, the train draws a power equal to its demand. Otherwise,
the train curtails its power consumption according to the Vi.
If the voltage drops below V min
, the train draws no power
to prevent safety incidents.
Squeeze control: A regenerating train injects power into the
power network, resulting in an increase in the train’s nodal
voltage. To prevent the voltage from exceeding the safety
limit V max
, the squeeze control is activated whenever the
nodal voltage at the train node i exceeds a certain triggering
voltage level V Tr

of the train. The squeeze control will command the train to
inject Pi units of power into the TPS, where Pi is given by

This control law is illustrated in Fig. 2b. Speciﬁcally, if the
nodal voltage at the train is lower than the triggering voltage,
the train injects all the regenerated power. Otherwise, the
train curtails the power injection according to the Vi by
burning the remaining power in a rheostatic braking system
[7]. If the voltage drops below V max
, the train does not
inject power into the TPS to prevent safety incidents.
The train’s power demand P d

i depend on the train’s running proﬁle and real-time
state. They can be provided by the train’s motion control
system. We note that
the electrical models described in
this section address the steady-state voltages and currents.
They ignore the power transients of the trains due to
their internal feedback control systems that implement the
i
overcurrent/squeeze control decisions. However, it is safe
to ignore these transients, because they can settle quickly
before the next overcurrent/squeeze control action [25]. This
steady-state analysis approach has been widely adopted in
TPS power ﬂow analysis [13]–[15].
IV. FALSE DATA INJECTION ATTACKS AGAINST TPS
In this section, we study how an attacker can mislead
the TPS into an inefﬁcient or unsafe operating state. We
focus on FDI attacks that tamper with the measurements
of train-borne voltage and current sensors. Such an attack
will cause the TPS to make wrong decisions of power
absorption/injection, since a train’s overcurrent and squeeze
controls depend on the sensor measurements. We further
consider attacks of two different objectives: (i) to increase
the system’s total instantaneous power consumption, and (ii)
to cause breaches of the safety conditions in Eq. (1). We call
them efﬁciency attack and safety attack, respectively. In this
section, we ﬁrst describe our threat model. Then, we analyze
the attacker’s approach to computing efﬁciency and safety
attacks. Lastly, we present numerical results to illustrate the
two kinds of attacks.
A. Threat Model
Real-world attackers against critical CPSes are often
smart, resourceful, and highly strategic. Their strategies can
be guided by detailed knowledge of their targets, which
can be obtained in practice by malicious insiders, long-term
data exﬁltration [2], or social engineering against employees,
contractors, or vendors of the operators in question [1].
In this paper, we follow Kerckhoffs’s principle to consider
an attacker who has accurate knowledge of the targeted
system and read access to the system state. Knowledge of
the system includes the electrical models and parameters
given in Section III, as well as the system’s method of
attack detection. The system state includes present power
demands, regeneration capacities, as well as voltage, current,
and position measurements of all the trains. This information
can be leaked through a compromised operation center,
as in recent high-proﬁle attacks [1], [2]. We assume that
the attacker can corrupt the voltage, current, and position
measurements of nodes in the set Na, where Na ⊆ N . Re-
cent studies have demonstrated that such unauthorized write
access can be obtained for analog sensors, traditional electro-
mechanical meters, and modern smart meters [8], [26], [27].
Analog sensors are vulnerable to controlled electromagnetic
interference [8]; measurement devices can be affected by
hardware trojans [9] and infected with malwares [10], [26].
Under the Kerckhoffs’s assumption on the attacker’s
knowledge, we will analyze his strategies of achieving
successful efﬁciency and safety attacks. Conversely, we will
also develop countermeasures by a defender to detect these
attacks. Our threat model is strong, but the conservative
analysis is necessary because any underestimation of the

attacker’s capability may have catastrophic consequences,
including extremely costly infrastructure damage and loss
of human lives.
We note that, alternatively, the attacker can launch FDI
attacks against the decisions of the local controls (i.e., the
Pi values for the trains). To detect such attacks, each train
can compare the Pi value in question with that computed
based on the train’s voltage and current measurements and
the a priori overcurrent and squeeze control laws. In the
rest of this paper, we focus on the analysis and detection of
FDI attacks on the voltage and current measurements only.
This problem is comparatively much more challenging since
information compromised right at the sources will preclude
its use for any subsequent sanity checks.
B. FDI Attack Construction
In the rest of the paper, we will use x(cid:4) to denote the
compromised version of a sensor measurement x. In this
section, we analyze how to compute an effective attack
vector, as a vector of false voltage and current measurements
to be injected into the sensing systems of the trains in Na.
Note that, in this section, we ignore position measurements
in the attack vector, because they will not affect the trains’
overcurrent and squeeze controls. In the following, we ﬁrst
derive conditions for the attack vector to mislead the train
into absorbing or injecting a certain amount of power. With
the calculated power absorptions/injections of the trains, we
can determine the system’s total power consumption and
hence its safety status. Thus, we can formulate the attacker’s
problem of ﬁnding an attack vector to achieve his goal (e.g.,
to maximize the total power consumption), under conditions
that we will state presently for enforcing a certain amount
of power absorption/injection.
The following conditions are sufﬁcient to enforce that a
train at node i ∈ Na will absorb or inject Pi units of power:

i and I(cid:4)
i . As a result, based on V (cid:4)
compromised measurement V (cid:4)
i ,
the train will follow the overcurrent/squeeze control law
to regulate its power absorption/injection at the attacker’s
desired value Pi. This control process is often achieved in
a closed loop, with the measurements V (cid:4)
i acting as
the feedback and the desired value Pi as the setpoint. Under
the condition Eq. (5), the actual power absorption/injection
under the aforementioned closed-loop control will converge
to Pi. Moreover, the condition Eq. (5) can hide the attack for
trains that can directly measure the power consumption. The
conditions Eqs. (6) and (7) ensure the feasibility of inducing
the train to absorb/inject Pi units of power. Speciﬁcally, the
attacker’s desired Pi should not exceed a regenerating train’s
regeneration capacity. The condition Eq. (6), where both Pi
and P d
i are negative, prevents the mechanism from violating
the overcurrent control. In summary, if the compromised
measurements V (cid:4)
i satisfy the conditions in Eq. (5) to
Eq. (9), the train will control its power absorption/injection
to Pi. With this understanding, the attacker can carefully
plan the attack vector to achieve his goal. Without
the
conditions in Eq. (5) to Eq. (9), the attacker cannot predict
the impact of his attack, and therefore cannot implement his
desired strategy.
i and I(cid:4)
Each sensor in the TPS may apply data quality checks
the measurements at
on its measurements. For instance,
present
time instant should not differ signiﬁcantly from
those predicted based on the measurements at previous
time instant. Intuitively, if the compromised measurement
is bounded around the true measurement, the data quality
checks, designed to be insensitive to natural random noises
of measurement, will not raise an alarm. Thus, we assume
that the compromised measurements need to satisfy:
v − Δv (cid:10) v(cid:4) (cid:10) v + Δv,
i − Δi (cid:10) i(cid:4) (cid:10) i + Δi,

[ΔI1, . . . , ΔIN ]T are the maximum errors allowed by
the data quality checks; x (cid:10) y means that each element of
x is no greater than the corresponding element in y. We
note that, if i /∈ Na, ΔVi = 0.
Based on the above conditions for the compromised mea-
surements, we formulate the efﬁciency and safety attacks.
1) Efﬁciency Attack: An efﬁciency attack causes an in-
crease or decrease in the total instantaneous power injected
or absorbed by the substations. In particular, we consider an
aggressive attacker who aims to maximize or minimize such
injected or absorbed power. Formally, the attacker solves the
following constrained optimization problem to compute the
attack vector {V (cid:4)

The above formulation captures the physical laws governing
the power network and the substations (i.e., Eq. (2) to
Eq. (4)), as well as how the attack vector induces the trains
to make erroneous power control decisions (i.e., Eq. (5) to
i |∀i ∈ Na} satisfying
Eq. (9)). Speciﬁcally, for any {V (cid:4)

Eq. (5) to Eq. (9), the attacker can predict the trains’ power

Solving the constrained optimization problem in Eq. (12)
can be computationally intensive, mainly because the con-
straints in Eqs. (8) and (9) are non-smooth and non-
differentiable. Existing constrained non-linear optimization
solvers (e.g., the fmincon function of MATLAB) often
require smooth objective and constraint functions. To use
these solvers, the attacker can adopt a divide-and-conquer
approach that divides the problem Eq. (12) into multiple
subproblems, in which a piece of Eq. (8) or Eq. (9) is
selected as a constraint for a train. By comparing the
optimization results of all the subproblems, the attacker can
obtain a global optimal solution to the problem in Eq. (12).
Because each train has three choices in Eq. (8) or Eq. (9),
this approach will generate a total of 3|Na| subproblems,
where |Na| is the number of trains under FDI attacks. As
the subproblems are mutually independent, the attacker can
solve the subproblems in parallel, to reduce computation
time. The ability to solve the problem in Eq. (12) in real
time can be important to the attacker. This is because, to
accumulate large energy loss, the attacker needs to keep at
the FDI attacks by solving Eq. (12) continually, based on the
latest system state given by s, P d
i . The attacker will
need to procure sufﬁcient computing resources for achieving
the real-time objective.

2) Safety Attack: For safety attacks, we model the space
of attack vectors that can cause the voltages at a subset of
the TPS nodes, denoted by Nunsafe, to cross the safety limits
in Eq. (1). The attack space is deﬁned by all the constraint
conditions in the optimization problem Eq. (12), and Vi /∈
[Vi,min, Vi,max], i ∈ Nunsafe. As long as the attacker can ﬁnd
