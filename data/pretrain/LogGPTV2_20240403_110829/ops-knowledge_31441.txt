User: I've been learning python by building a webapp on google app engine over the past five or six months. I also just finished taking a databases class this semester where I learned about views, and their benefits.
Is there an equivalent with the GAE datastore using python?
Assistant: Read-only views (the most common type) are basically queries against one or more tables to present the illusion of new tables. If you took a college-level database course, you probably learned about relational databases, and I'm guessing you're looking for something like relational views.
The short answer is No.
The GAE datastore is non-relational. It doesn't have tables. It's essentially a very large distributed hash table that uses composite keys to present the (very useful) illusion of Entities, which are easy at first glance to mistake for rows in a relational database.
The longer answer depends on what you'd do if you had a view.
