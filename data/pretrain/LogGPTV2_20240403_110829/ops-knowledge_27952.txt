User: I don't know how to run the activate.bat in a Python Tools for Visual Studio Project. I have a directory environment in my project with my virtualenv. But, I don't know how I can run ./env/Scripts/activate.bat before the project run my main python script.
Assistant: I found that if : 

main.py is set as Startup File,
in the Properties of the project -> Debug tab -> Interpreter Path field, I put the path C:...\env\Scripts\python.exe (i.e. the python executable of the virtualenv)

It works !
