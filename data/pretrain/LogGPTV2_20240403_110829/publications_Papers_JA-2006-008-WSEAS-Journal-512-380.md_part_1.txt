Abstract: - Dynamic packaging has been introduced as an innovative technology allowing for the automated online
configuration and assembling of packaged travel products for individual customers. Due to the high level of
autonomy and heterogeneity of tourism information systems, dynamic packaging systems cannot be successfully
developed by considering only syntactic and structural integration of data. One important aspect that needs to be
contemplated to develop a new breed of dynamic packaging systems is semantic heterogeneity in order to reduce
the potential failures that may occur when integrating tourism information systems. Our objective is to develop a
platform to enable the development of dynamic packaging systems using the latest semantic technologies, such as
knowledge bases, ontologies, and semantic Web.
Key-Words: - Semantic Web, Ontologies, Semantic Information Integration, Dynamic Packaging, Travel
