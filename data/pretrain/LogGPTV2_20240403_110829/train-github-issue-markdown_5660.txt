Awesome effort guys. I have recently migrated from Mac OS. There is feature of
'Spotlight Search' in Mac which helps to search a particular file or anything.
It also helps to find word meanings.
This helped me a lot as I could find meanings clicking few buttons.
I would request to add that feature (dictionary search) in Powertools under
PowerToys Run command.
