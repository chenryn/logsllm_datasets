to compare prices in di(cid:130)erent times and compute shi(cid:137)s in the price
distribution due to time passed between the collection of dataset
D and present time. To compensate for the loss of information
from cleartext prices becoming less abundant, additional features
available in professional ad-campaign planners (as in FDVT [14])
could be used in the future to enhance the setups tested. With the
results of these campaigns (in essence, charge prices for RTB ads
that ful(cid:128)l a given setup s), the PME can train a model to estimate
the cost of new ads with a given setup s(cid:48) close, or equal, to one
tested, i.e. s(cid:48) ∼ s ∈ S.
Number of required ad-campaigns. An important decision in
running probing campaigns is how many of them to launch, and
with how many impressions in each one, in order to obtain a good
approximation of the underlying distribution of prices. For this, we
analyzed the ad-campaigns found for MoPub in D. We identi(cid:128)ed
280 such campaigns in 2015, with mean and standard deviation
of charge price of m = 1.84 and std = 2.15 CPM, respectively.
We use the process described in [39] and the next formulation to
compute d, the expected error on the mean, assuming a suggested
number of setups n, and ignoring the (cid:128)nite population correction
adjustment (thus assuming a more conservative approximation of
n) d = Zα/2×std
, where Z is the z-score of normal distribution.
Using the 144 setups proposed, we can approximate to more than
95% CI (i.e., α =0.05) the mean price of campaigns observed in the
wild, assuming a margin of error 0.35 CPM. Also, considering the
distribution of prices within the largest of ad-campaigns detected
for MoPub with 1.8k impressions, we can approximate to 95% CI
the mean price of a campaign, assuming an error 0.1 CPM and
minimum of 185 impressions per campaign.

5.3 Ad-campaigns analysis
Using the above as guideline, we executed two rounds of di(cid:130)erent
ad-campaigns to collect data on prices (Table 3). Our ad-campaigns
advertised a real non-for-pro(cid:128)t NGO in the area of data trans-
parency, in an a(cid:138)empt to avoid polluting users with meaningless
impressions, and trying to do something useful with the allocated
budget.
Dataset collected. (cid:140)e (cid:128)rst round (A1) was executed for 2 weeks
in May 2016 and utilized the 4 ADXs mentioned earlier (also found
in D) that encrypt price noti(cid:128)cations and targeted publishers of
many IAB categories. (cid:140)e second round (A2) was executed with the
same experimental setups as A1 during June 2016, but in this case
the DSP was instructed to use only MoPub, while still targeting
similar IAB categories of publishers. (cid:140)ese constraints allowed us
to directly compare encrypted with cleartext prices in the same
period, and time-shi(cid:137) all prices detected in D from 2015 to 2016.
In both campaigns, the DSP was given an upper bound on the
bidding CPM price to safeguard that the allocated budget will not
be consumed quickly. Because studying the e(cid:130)ects of retargeting is

similar preprocessing for the encrypted prices as we did earlier for
the cleartext prices (normalization and clustering to 4 classes of
well balanced groups). Next, we trained a RF model to predict the
class of an encrypted price, based on the available parameters S.
For the training and testing, we applied 10-fold cross validation,
and averaged results over 10 runs. Using features such as city of
user, day of week and the time the ad was delivered, ad size, mo-
bile OS of the user’s device, IAB category of the publisher, ADX
used and device type, our classi(cid:128)er can achieve a very good perfor-
mance: T P =82.9%, F P =6.8%, Precision=83.5%, Recall=82.9%, 0.964
AUCROC. (cid:140)ese scores are weighted averages across all classes,
with no class performing worse than 5% from the average. We
repeated this process with more price classes (i.e., 5-10 groups) for
higher granularity of price prediction, but the results with 4 classes
outperformed them.
When the exact publisher used is also taken into account in the
model, the performance of the classi(cid:128)er increases to 95% accuracy,
and 0.99 AUCROC. However, this is classic over-(cid:128)(cid:138)ing and we
should caution that the publishers used in the ad-campaigns are
just a subset of the thousands of possible publishers that can be
found in real weblogs. (cid:140)erefore, we chose to use the model with
the IAB category but without the exact publisher as part of its
input features. Next, this model was used for the estimation of the
encrypted prices of nURLs found in the weblogs of each user in D,
given the matching parameter values from S ⊆ F.
6 USER COST FOR ADVERTISERS
(cid:140)e previous sections allowed us to: (1) bootstrap our price model-
ing engine from existing user weblogs, so that we (cid:128)nd the important
features describing well the observed RTB cleartext prices, (2) using
these important features, run probing ad-campaigns with ADXs
that send encrypted price noti(cid:128)cations, so that we collect ground
truth on such prices from performance reports delivered to us, (3)
using such ground truth, train a machine learning model to estimate
the price of new RTB noti(cid:128)cations sent in encrypted form. We are
now ready to study the overall cost advertisers paid for each of the
users in our dataset D, who received cleartext and/or encrypted
prices in nURLs of delivered ads.
6.1 Encrypted vs. cleartext price distributions
(cid:140)e work in [62] assumed that encrypted prices follow the same
distribution with cleartext prices. To examine the validity of such
assumption, we plot the distributions of both encrypted and cleart-
ext charge prices we got from the two ad-campaigns we performed.
Interestingly, from Figure 16, the distribution of encrypted prices in
A1 is distinctly di(cid:130)erent and of higher median value (∼1.7×) than
cleartext prices of A2.
In addition, we study the distributions between di(cid:130)erent time
periods and ADXs to extract important lessons. First, we see that
the cleartext price distribution of MoPub (2015) is similar to all
ADXs sending cleartext prices, either when considering a 2 month
period or a full year. Hence, we can study MoPub as a representative
example and extrapolate lessons for the rest of the ADXs that send
cleartext prices. Second, the distribution of cleartext prices from A2
(MoPub) are of higher median value and can be used to establish
the price shi(cid:137) due to time di(cid:130)erence between the time T the dataset

in our dataset and the 2 probing ad-campaigns.
beyond the scope of this paper, we did not ask the DSP to perform
such campaigns. However, the DSP was instructed to bid in a
dynamic manner, as low or high as needed to get the minimum
of impressions delivered for the various experimental setups we
requested. We plan to investigate the e(cid:130)ects of retargeting in a
separate and dedicated future study. Overall, we managed to receive
across all setups, over 600k impressions displayed with encrypted
price noti(cid:128)cations to more than 200 publishers, and over 300k
impressions with cleartext price noti(cid:128)cations to more than 300
publishers, reaching audiences of 6 IAB categories common to both
noti(cid:128)cation types.
Cost paid vs. IAB category. In Figure 15, we compare the over-
lapping IAB categories of the RTB impressions we took from (i) the
set of encrypted prices from the ad-campaign on four ADXs in A1,
(ii) the set of cleartext prices from the ad-campaign on MoPub (A2),
(iii) the 2 months MoPub subset of D. Note that in some cases, the
results from D vary more than in the ad-campaigns. (cid:140)is is to be
expected, as the dataset includes prices from numerous DSP-ADX
pairs for many ad-campaigns running in parallel in the duration of
a year, whereas our two ad-campaigns are more targeted to speci(cid:128)c
DSP-ADX pairs.
Regarding the cleartext prices of di(cid:130)erent IAB categories, al-
though the median prices are usually in the same order of magni-
tude, they are higher in the case of the recent ad-campaign contrary
to the 2 month dataset. We believe that this di(cid:130)erence is due to
the time shi(cid:137) between the dataset collected in 2015 and the ad
campaigns performed in 2016. In addition, we see that the median
price is always higher in case of encrypted prices (A1), compared to
the cleartext prices of the second ad-campaign (A2) and dataset D.
5.4 Encrypted price modeling
Using the ground truth data collected from the (cid:128)rst round of ad-
campaigns (encrypted prices) with various parameters within the
subset of features S, we trained a machine learning classi(cid:128)er to
predict values of encrypted prices. We note that given the problem
of modeling real values, we (cid:128)rst applied regression models with
di(cid:130)erent combinations of dependent variables (S). However, the
high variability of charge prices lead to low performance (high er-
ror) of the regression models. (cid:140)erefore, we proceeded to split the
prices into groups for classi(cid:128)cation. As a (cid:128)rst step, we performed

was collected, and T (cid:48) when the campaigns were executed. In reality,
this price shi(cid:137) can be detected evenly across multiple probing ad-
campaigns (e.g., once per quarter of year).
6.2 How much do advertisers pay
to reach a user?
Equipped with our presented methodology for estimating encrypted
prices, we are now ready to respond to our motivating question.
Speci(cid:128)cally, we utilize our method and compute the overall cost
advertisers paid for each user in the dataset D, i.e., across a whole
year of mobile web transactions. We also apply a time-correction
coe(cid:129)cient on the cleartext prices using the prices from the second
round of ad-campaigns. (cid:140)is allows us to consider the increase in
cleartext prices due to time di(cid:130)erence from the weblog collection
(2015) and the ad-campaigns execution (2016).
Figure 17 presents these cumulative costs in the form of CDFs of
the price distributions. As expected, we observe that the cumulative
cost due to encrypted prices is still not surpassing the cleartext,
since the la(cid:138)er is still the dominant price delivery mechanism in
mobile RTB. We also note that some users are more costly than
others. Speci(cid:128)cally, the median user costs ∼25 CPM, and up to 73%
of the users cost < 100 CPM through the year for the mobile ad
ecosystem in the given dataset. (cid:140)is means that the ad-ecosystem
reaches the average user very cheaply and multiple times below
what users estimate this cost to be (e.g.,10s of dollars [11]).
On the other hand, for ∼ 2% of users, the advertising ecosystem
spent 1000-10000 CPM for the same time period. Finally, about 60%
of users had an increased average cumulative cost of ∼ 55% on top
of their cleartext cost, due to the estimated encrypted prices. (cid:140)ese
users had a median of 14.3 CPM added to their total cost, with some
extreme cases of 1000-5000 CPM.
In the previous result, we compared the distributions of en-
crypted and cleartext prices, while disregarding the targeted user.
In order to identify if the cost paid through encrypted prices is the
same with cleartext for a speci(cid:128)c user, we compare for each user
the total costs in Figure 18 and average cost per impression in Fig-
ure 19, for each type of price. We observe that a signi(cid:128)cant portion
of users (∼20-25%) cost similarly for ads embedded with encrypted
or cleartext prices. As expected, due to the current majority of
cleartext prices in the mobile ad market, a large portion of users
Figure 17: Cumulative CPM paid per user in our year long dataset.
(∼75%) have higher cumulative cost from cleartext than encrypted
prices. However, a small portion (∼2%) costs more (2-32×) in en-
crypted than in cleartext form, because they were delivered mostly
ads with encrypted prices. When we normalize the cumulative ad
cost of user per impression delivered (Figure 19), we (cid:128)nd that for
small prices of ≤3 CPM/impression, cleartext is more dominant
across users. We also (cid:128)nd a small portion (∼2%) of users who cost
up to 5× more CPM/impression for the delivered ads in encrypted
than in cleartext form. We anticipate this portion to increase as
the encrypted noti(cid:128)cation becomes the dominant delivery of RTB
prices in mobile.
6.3 Summary
By studying the overall RTB advertising cost for users in our dataset,
and distinguishing the encrypted from the cleartext prices, we found
that the basic assumption of related work [62] that encrypted and
cleartext prices are similar, is not valid (encrypted prices are around
1.7× higher). Furthermore, advertisers, based on users’ personal
data, paid ∼25 CPM for delivering ads to an average user, and less
than ∼100 CPM for delivering ads to 3/4 of users during a year. We
also identi(cid:128)ed a small portion of outlier users (∼2%) who cost 10-
100× more to the ad-ecosystem than the average user, and a similar
portion that costs up to 32× more in encrypted than cleartext prices,
even though encrypted prices are only a quarter of the mobile RTB
ecosystem.
Validation. As an e(cid:130)ort to validate our methodology, we can ex-
trapolate how much users cost for the ad-ecosystem and if this
estimation compares with current market numbers. For this extrap-
olation, we make some assumptions on how our dataset represents
the overall ecosystem of users and advertisers. In particular, we
assume that our average mobile user, whose annual ad-cost is in the
8-102 CPM range (25th-75th perc.), has: (1) performed 2.65 hours
online daily, which is ∼83% of the average daily mobile internet
usage, when considering average tablet and other mobile device
usage [50], (2) performed internet activity from both mobile and
laptop/desktop devices, the former tra(cid:129)c type being ∼51% of to-
tal internet time [12], (3) received ads in a similar fashion in both
HTTP and HTTPS, the former being ∼40% of the total tra(cid:129)c de-
livered to a user [20, 72], (4) received ads over RTB, which has an
overhead management and intermediaries cost of ∼55% [68], and
(5) received ads in a similar fashion over RTB and traditional and
