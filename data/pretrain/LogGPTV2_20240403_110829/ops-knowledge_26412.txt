User: What is cloud computing? What are the types and deployment models of cloud computing?
Assistant: Cloud computing is an Internet-based computing model that provides services and processes data through resources such as cloud servers, storage, networks, and databases. Cloud computing can achieve high flexibility, scalability, low cost and other advantages. The types of cloud computing mainly include: 1. Public cloud: The resources provided by the cloud service provider are shared by all users. 2. Private cloud: It is exclusively owned by the organization or individual, and can only be accessed in the internal network. 3. Hybrid cloud: the combination of public cloud and private cloud through technical means. 4. Community cloud: a cloud platform where organizations or users in a specific field or industry share resources. According to the deployment mode, cloud computing can be divided into: 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides basic computing and storage capabilities, and users can operate various operating systems and applications through virtualization technology. 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): Provides a basic environment for application development, testing, and operation, and users can directly develop and deploy their own applications. 3. Software as a Service (SaaS): Provide various application software and services, run on the cloud platform, and users only need to access through the network to use.
