### Issue Report: Legend Style for `histtype='step'` in `matplotlib.axes.hist`

**Reported on:** Fri, Feb 11, 2011, at 22:02:28

**Summary:**
When using `histtype='step'` in `matplotlib.axes.hist`, the automatic legend style displays an empty box instead of a line, which is not intuitive. This behavior seems inconsistent with the expected output, as a line would be more appropriate for this histogram type.

**Example Code:**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.hist([0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2], [0, 1, 2, 3], histtype='step', label="histtype='step'")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

**Current Workaround:**
To address this, one can use proxy `Line2D` objects to customize the legend. However, this workaround can become cumbersome and is not ideal for common operations.

**Cause:**
The issue arises because `axes.hist` in `axes.py` (line 7799, current SVN head) always creates patch objects, even for the line-based step style. This results in the legend displaying an empty box instead of a line.

**Proposed Solution:**
A patch has been attached that replaces the call to `.fill` with `.plot` in the `axes.hist` function. This change appears to work, but it has not been exhaustively tested.

**Questions:**
1. **Intended Behavior:** Is this the intended behavior, or am I missing something?
2. **Impact on Return Signature:** This change will cause the return signature to possibly include `Line2D` objects instead of just patches. Will this break any existing functionality?

**Attachments:**
- `histtype_plot.patch`: A patch file that makes the necessary changes to the `axes.hist` function.
