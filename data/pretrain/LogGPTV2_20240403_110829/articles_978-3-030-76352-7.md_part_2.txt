Abstract. This paper introduces and explores the vision wherefore
stakeholders and the process of staking —that is, the idea of guaran-
teeing the quality of a process by risking valuable assets on their cor-
rect execution— may run both on and off a blockchain while in the
context of cloud-enabled services and processes. The emerging trend
behind blockchain-oriented computing and the reliance on stakeholders
therein make distilling and evaluating this vision a priority to deliver
high-quality, sustainable services of the future. We identify key defin-
ing concepts of stakeholders and the staking process, using three very
different staking scenarios as a base. Subsequently, we analyze the key
challenges that these stakeholders face and propose the development of
a framework that can help overcome these challenges. Finally, we give
a road-map to steer systematic research stemming from the proposed
vision,leveragingdesignsciencealongwithshort-cyclicexperimentation.

1 Introduction
Thecontinuedriseinpopularityofblockchaintechnologyhassparkednewsolu-
tions for a wide variety of service processes, such as smart contracts, that place
a strong emphasis on trusted computing and transparency [1].
The trust or trustlessness in most of these solutions is realized by the provi-
sionofproofs,whicharepubliclysharedontheblockchain.Theseproofsmanifest

to what extent these proofs actually realize a trusted or trustless environment,
see, e.g. [5]. An emerging key actor in blockchain services is the staker; an actor
who proves that they are invested in the quality/correctness of the service, its
environment and its execution in an attempt to add trustworthiness to it. Usu-
ally,thisisdonebylocking anasset(suchasacryptocurrency)ontheblockchain,
which will either lose value or fail to generate revenue if the service fails to live
up to the promised/expected quality.

Stakers often come into play when services run partly on and partly off the
blockchain; in a common scenario, a transaction may be comprised of agree-
ments (including, for example, classically-defined business-level agreements and
application-level agreements) that may be stored on the blockchain. The actual
executionoftheprocess,however,(e.g.,deliveryofadigitalasset),willtakeplace
off-chain.Thestakerpertainstothatactorinsuchscenariosthatimprovestrust-
worthinessinthesensethatitchecks,verifies,orotherwisewitnesses that,what
has been promised initially, is (likely to be) actually delivered. For example, the
staker can help to maintain a sufficient level of network security by replicating
networkassets.Rolesthatsuchastakermayplayinclude,butarenotrestricted

Our vision in this sense is, therefore, to investigate those scenarios in which
stakersattempttoaddtrustworthinesstoablockchainenvironmentandtosup-
port the staker’s endeavor to do so. This proposition has, so far, been neglected
at best and deserves further attention.
This paper sets out to define in an abstract manner the concept of a staker
in a staking scenario; we conclude the definition by defining the main chal-
lenges behind such a scenario. Subsequently, the paper proposes the develop-
ment of a novel staking methodology and associated toolkit to support stakers

three prototypical blockchain-oriented orchestration service scenarios and plots
a road-map for future work.
2 Background
This section discusses 3 prototypical application staking scenarios and general-
izesfromthemintoseveralfundamentalkeycharacteristicstounderpinageneric
definition of a staker as well as a rudimentary staking framework.
1. Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol
The most popular alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol
for blockchains is Proof-of-Stake (PoS) [4]. The PoS protocol (semi-)randomly
assigns a staker, who has locked some cryptocurrency, the authority to create a
new block, and update the blockchain and rewards them if the updated chain
achieves consensus (i.e., is approved by other stakers) [6]. Actors sending trans-
actionsontheblockchainbenefitfromstakerswhoensurethattheblockchainis
in a trustworthy state.
2. Staking in Goods and Services
Distributed marketplaces for (digital) goods and services use blockchain and
smartcontractsforimpartialenforcementofpurchasingandarebecomingmore
and more popular1. In order to guarantee the quality of an (off-chain) product

decentralized-marketplace/.
Staking Assets Management on Blockchains 5
being offered through such an (on-chain) decentralized marketplace, the mar-
ketplace can ask the stakers to stake some assets on high-quality products and
reward stakers that stake in popular products. Both the seller and the buyer on
the market can profit from the independent quality assurance provided by the
staker in this scenario.
3. Staking in Service Monitoring
RecentinitiativeshaveproposedmovingthemanagementofServiceLevelAgree-
ments (SLAs) to smart contracts on a blockchain [3,7]. Checking that the
(off-chain) service lives up to the Quality-of-Service (QoS) and non-functional
requirements captured in the (on-chain) smart contract representation of the
SLA depends on the correct monitoring of the service, which necessarily hap-
pens off-chain. This monitoring can be done by third parties who stake on their
ability to provide independent, high-quality monitoring. These stakers take up
the role of an oracle and are rewarded by the smart contract if they manage to
achieve consensus on their measurements.
Based on the 3 cases introduced above, we generalize here four fundamental
characteristics of the staker actor:
1. The staker provides supportive services with respect to trustworthiness to a
process by measuring/testing or guaranteeing some of its quality aspects.
2. Thisprocessoftenruns,atleastpartially,off-chainandthestakerisgenerally
not the main actor in the process.
3. The staker demonstrates that they are invested in the quality of the process
bybackinguptheaccuracyoftheirmeasurements/tests/guaranteewithsome
staked asset(s) on the blockchain (e.g., cryptocurrency).
4. The staker follows a protocol that allows it to check and be checked by other
stakers.
5. The staker is rewarded by the process, depending on the value of their con-
tribution and the size of their stake.
3 Problem Definition
As argued in Sect.2, there is increasing recognition of the usefulness of staking
asameanstoleveragetrustworthinesstoadecentralizedprocess.Unfortunately,
the perspective of the staker in these processes has thus far been rather rudi-
mentary and overly simplistic in nature. Typically, existing methods and tools
merelyassumethestaker’sdecisionstobetakenwithoutconsideringhowexactly
this decision process takes place.
However, staking is indeed an exceedingly challenging and critical endeavor
since it concerns guaranteeing the quality of processes that may reside outside
the staker’s sphere of control. We claim that the only type of staking already
happening in practice is staking on fully transparent processes such as the PoS
in Scenario 1. The challenging nature of such an actor, who has little to no
control over the process, has already been recognized in the past, for example,
in the context of Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) testing by Canfora and
