  - **Abstract**: This paper introduces and explores the vision where stakeholders and the process of staking—guaranteeing the quality of a process by risking valuable assets on their correct execution—may run both on and off a blockchain in the context of cloud-enabled services and processes. The emerging trend behind blockchain-oriented computing and the reliance on stakeholders make distilling and evaluating this vision a priority to deliver high-quality, sustainable services of the future. We identify key defining concepts of stakeholders and the staking process, using three very different staking scenarios as a base. Subsequently, we analyze the key challenges that these stakeholders face and propose the development of a framework that can help overcome these challenges. Finally, we provide a roadmap to steer systematic research stemming from the proposed vision, leveraging design science along with short-cyclic experimentation.

### Introduction
The continued rise in popularity of blockchain technology has sparked new solutions for a wide variety of service processes, such as smart contracts, which place a strong emphasis on trusted computing and transparency. The trust or trustlessness in most of these solutions is realized by the provision of proofs, which are publicly shared on the blockchain. These proofs manifest themselves in many different forms, such as Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), or Proof-of-Authority (PoA). An emerging key actor in blockchain services is the staker, who proves their investment in the quality and correctness of the service, its environment, and its execution, thereby adding trustworthiness. This is typically done by locking an asset (such as a cryptocurrency) on the blockchain, which will lose value or fail to generate revenue if the service fails to meet the promised/expected quality.

### Background
This section discusses three prototypical application staking scenarios and generalizes from them to identify several fundamental key characteristics to underpin a generic definition of a staker and a rudimentary staking framework.

1. **Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol**:
   - The most popular alternative to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus protocol for blockchains is Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The PoS protocol (semi-)randomly assigns a staker, who has locked some cryptocurrency, the authority to create a new block and update the blockchain. They are rewarded if the updated chain achieves consensus (i.e., is approved by other stakers). Actors sending transactions on the blockchain benefit from stakers who ensure that the blockchain is in a trustworthy state.

2. **Staking in Goods and Services**:
   - Distributed marketplaces for (digital) goods and services use blockchain and smart contracts for impartial enforcement of purchasing and are becoming more popular. To guarantee the quality of an (off-chain) product being offered through such an (on-chain) decentralized marketplace, the marketplace can ask stakers to stake some assets on high-quality products and reward stakers that stake in popular products. Both the seller and the buyer on the market can profit from the independent quality assurance provided by the staker in this scenario.

3. **Staking in Service Monitoring**:
   - Recent initiatives have proposed moving the management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to smart contracts on a blockchain. Checking that the (off-chain) service meets the Quality-of-Service (QoS) and non-functional requirements captured in the (on-chain) smart contract representation of the SLA depends on the correct monitoring of the service, which necessarily happens off-chain. This monitoring can be done by third parties who stake on their ability to provide independent, high-quality monitoring. These stakers take up the role of an oracle and are rewarded by the smart contract if they manage to achieve consensus on their measurements.

Based on the three cases introduced above, we generalize four fundamental characteristics of the staker actor:
1. The staker provides supportive services with respect to trustworthiness to a process by measuring/testing or guaranteeing some of its quality aspects.
2. This process often runs, at least partially, off-chain, and the staker is generally not the main actor in the process.
3. The staker demonstrates their investment in the quality of the process by backing up the accuracy of their measurements/tests/guarantees with some staked assets on the blockchain (e.g., cryptocurrency).
4. The staker follows a protocol that allows it to check and be checked by other stakers.
5. The staker is rewarded by the process, depending on the value of their contribution and the size of their stake.

### Problem Definition
There is increasing recognition of the usefulness of staking as a means to leverage trustworthiness in a decentralized process. However, the perspective of the staker in these processes has thus far been rather rudimentary and overly simplistic. Typically, existing methods and tools merely assume the staker’s decisions without considering how exactly this decision process takes place. Staking is indeed a challenging and critical endeavor since it concerns guaranteeing the quality of processes that may reside outside the staker’s sphere of control. We claim that the only type of staking already happening in practice is staking on fully transparent processes such as the PoS in Scenario 1. The challenging nature of such an actor, who has little to no control over the process, has already been recognized in the past, for example, in the context of Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) testing by Canfora and others.

### Staking Decision Process
- **Start**
  - Identify relevant quality aspects of the process.
  - Assess corresponding technical metrics.
  - Identify relevant measurements.
  - Decide if staking is worthwhile.
  - Identify risks and rewards.
