User: The Question
Where can I access the documentation for legacy versions of the nose testing framework?
Why
I have to support some python code that must run against python 2.6 on a Centos 6 system.  It is clear from experimentation that nosetests --failed does not work on this system.  I'd like to know if I'm just missing a module or not.  More generally, I need to know what capabilities of nose that I have grown used to I will have to do without, without having to check for them individually.
Assistant: You should be able to upgrade nosetests via pip, while still staying with python 2.6. At least, nose 1.3.4 (latest as of this writing) installs cleanly inside the py2.6 virtualenv I just threw together. I don't have any py2.6-compatible code to hand to show that it's working correctly, though.
