User: How do I change the default Python version used in my Mac Snow Leopard? I'm trying to switch from v2.5 to v3.0
Assistant: Try the following: defaults write com.apple.versioner.python Version 3.2 in a terminal. Assuming you have 3.2 installed of course.
EDIT: As Neil Deily points out in his comment this only works with Python distributions shipped by Apple.
