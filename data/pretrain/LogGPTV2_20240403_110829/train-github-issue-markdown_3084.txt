Subject: Request for Update to Flask Mailing List Page

Dear Flask Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring your attention to an issue on the Flask Mailing List page, which can be found at the following URL:
- [Flask Mailing List](http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/)

This page currently references the mailing list archive located here:
- [Flask Mailing List Archive](http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/archive/)

The archive shows that the most recent email is from October 29, 2012, which may give the impression that the Flask community is no longer active.

However, I have discovered that the mailing list at the following URL appears to be more up-to-date and active:
- [LibreList Flask Mailing List](http://librelist.com/browser/flask/)

To ensure that the Flask community is accurately represented and to avoid any confusion, I kindly request that you update the [Flask Mailing List](http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/) page to reflect this change.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I appreciate your efforts in maintaining the Flask project and its community.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
