The Flask Mailinglist page:  
http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/
mentions this page:  
http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/archive/  
Which shows the latest email from 2012-10-29, giving the impression that the
Flask community is no longer active
This page seems to be up to date:  
http://librelist.com/browser/flask/
Please update http://flask.pocoo.org/mailinglist/ to reflect this change.  
Thank you.
