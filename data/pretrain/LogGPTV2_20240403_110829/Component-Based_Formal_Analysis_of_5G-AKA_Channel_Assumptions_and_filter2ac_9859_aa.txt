## Abstract
The 5G mobile telephony standards are nearing completion and will soon be adopted by billions of users worldwide. Ensuring the security of 5G communication is crucial for building trust in a critical component of everyday life and national infrastructure.

We perform a fine-grained formal analysis of 5G's main authentication and key agreement protocol (AKA) and provide the first models that explicitly consider all parties defined by the protocol specification. Our analysis reveals that the security of 5G-AKA critically relies on unstated assumptions about the inner workings of the underlying channels. In practice, this means that a provider can easily and 'correctly' implement the standard insecurely, leaving the protocol vulnerable to a security-critical race condition. We provide the first models and analysis considering component and channel compromise in 5G, whose results further demonstrate the fragility and subtle trust assumptions of the 5G-AKA protocol.

We propose formally verified fixes to the encountered issues and have worked with 3GPP to ensure these fixes are adopted.

## I. Introduction
The 5th Generation (5G) mobile networks and telecommunications standard is currently under development and is nearly finalized. A crucial component of this standard is the "5G Authentication and Key Agreement" (5G-AKA) protocol, developed by 3GPP. This protocol is an evolution of the AKA variants used in 3G and 4G and is used to authenticate and establish keys between the involved parties, including subscribers, serving networks, and home networks. The security of all 5G communication, therefore, crucially relies on 5G-AKA.

Traditionally, security protocol standards were not developed in tandem with rigorous security analysis, leading to many vulnerabilities being discovered after deployment. More recently, there has been a positive trend where rigorous scientific analysis is part of the development process, as seen in IETF’s TLS 1.3 protocol, which benefited from being developed alongside various analysis methods.

Given the extremely wide deployment of 5G in the near future, it is prudent to perform state-of-the-art analysis for this standard as well.

## Methodology
Our work aims to provide rigorous formal analysis and improve the security of the 5G-AKA standard. We use formal symbolic modeling with the TAMARIN prover, which has been successfully used in the development of major protocols such as TLS 1.3.

Several aspects of the 5G-AKA protocol complicate formal analysis:
1. The sheer complexity of the specification documentation, which spans hundreds of pages.
2. The complexity of the protocol, involving four parties, sequence counters, and complex channel assumptions.
3. The informal nature of the security requirements, requiring the modeler to make complex assumptions based on possible use cases.

We closely model the 5G-AKA specification, explicitly modeling all four main parties, including a separate credential storage component in the home network. We also explicitly model possible assumptions on the channels connecting these parties. We then analyze the resulting system model with respect to a range of threat models, including compromised components and channels.

## Related Work
Previous versions of AKA have been analyzed after deployment, typically using simplified models. The original 3G AKA protocol was manually analyzed in 1999 using TLA and BAN Logic, which consider abstract models much coarser than modern techniques and only weak threat models.

In 2012, Tsay and Mjølsnes presented a vulnerability in the UMTS-AKA and LTE-AKA protocols, allowing for a violation of authentication properties based on session confusion. This attack was found indirectly through the use of CryptoVerif.

Køien proposed improvements to 4G’s AKA, achieving full mutual online authentication. 5G-AKA now forwards one authentication vector at a time, reducing the level of trust required between network operators.

Arapinis et al. analyzed 3G’s authentication protocols, discovering attacks against the privacy and linkability of subscriber identities using ProVerif. O’Hanlon et al. considered the interaction between 4G’s authentication protocols and operator-backed WiFi services, detailing how these interactions can enable serious privacy violations.

Hussain et al. combined symbolic model checking with cryptographic protocol verification for 4G’s attach, detach, and paging procedures, discovering ten new attacks, including an authentication relay attack.

In recent concurrent work, Basin et al. used a similar approach to ours to analyze 5G-AKA but focused on different aspects, such as the counter re-synchronization method and privacy guarantees. They merged two major components (AUSF and ARPF) into a single 'Home Network' entity, while we model all four parties as defined in the protocol’s specification and consider a range of compromise models.

## Contributions
We provide three main contributions:
1. A fine-grained formal model of the 5G-AKA standard that enables a detailed view of the interaction between the various security-critical components.
2. Symbolic analysis of this model with respect to a range of threat models, confirming many already discovered issues and subtle assumptions and requirements to achieve security in 5G-AKA.
3. Discovery that the security of 5G-AKA critically relies on unstated assumptions about the inner workings of the underlying channels, particularly a potential race condition. We propose fixes and prove that they prevent the attack. We have reported our findings to the 3GPP SA3 working group and are working with a major provider to integrate a fix to the standard.

## Overview
We structure our work in three main parts:
1. **Protocol Description and Threat Model**: We describe the 5G-AKA protocol, the threat model implied by the standard, security properties, and their formalization.
2. **Formal Modeling and Analysis**: We formalize and model a basic threat model, perform analysis, and consider stronger threat models involving channel and component compromise.
3. **Implications and Conclusions**: We discuss the potential implications of our results, our interaction with the 3GPP working groups, and upcoming changes to the standard, before concluding.

## II. The 5G-AKA Protocol
The 5G-AKA protocol is the core authentication and key agreement protocol within the newly proposed 5G standard. It has evolved from the EPS-AKA protocol used in 4G/LTE and is specified in §6.1.3.2 of 3GPP Technical Specification 33.501. We model version v0.7.0.

### Key Entities
- **UE (User Equipment)**: Mobile devices like phones or USB dongles, uniquely identified by their SUPI (Subscription Permanent Identifier).
- **SEAF (Security Anchor Function)**: Located in the serving network.
- **AUSF (Authentication Server Function)**: Located in the home network.
- **ARPF (Authentication Credential Repository and Processing Function)**: Located in the home network, often in a secure location like a Hardware Security Module.

### Normal Execution
1. **SUCI, HN**: The UE sends its encrypted SUCI and the name of its home network to a SEAF in the serving network.
2. **5G-AIR**: The SEAF sends a 5G-AIR message containing the previous message and the name of the serving network to an AUSF in the home network.
3. **Auth-Info Request**: The AUSF transmits this information to the home network’s ARPF.
4. **Auth-Info Response**: The ARPF de-conceals the SUCI, retrieves the relevant K, generates a 128-bit random number RAND, an AUTN value, an Expected Response (XRES*), and a session key KAUSF. These are sent to the AUSF.
5. **5G-AIA**: The AUSF sends a 5G-AIA message containing AUTN, HXRES*, the new anchor key KSEAF, and the SUPI.
6. **Auth-Req**: The SEAF sends RAND and AUTN to the UE.
7. **Auth-Resp**: The UE responds with RES* to prove its identity and ownership of K.
8. **5G-AC and 5G-ACA**: The SEAF checks the hash of RES* against HXRES*. If they match, the SEAF sends an Authentication Confirmation (5G-AC) message to the AUSF, which acknowledges it with a 5G-ACA message.

This detailed execution ensures that all parties can derive and agree upon an anchor key KSEAF, which is crucial for the security of subsequent communications.
