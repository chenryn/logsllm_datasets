When the help window pops up in macOS, here are the basic commands to navigate and exit the help screen:

- **Page Up**: Press `Shift + Page Up` or use the `fn` key with the up arrow.
- **Page Down**: Press `Shift + Page Down` or use the `fn` key with the down arrow.
- **End of Document**: Press `fn` + down arrow to move to the end of the document.
- **Exiting the Help Screen**: You can type any one of the following commands:
  - `q`
  - `:q`
  - `Q`
  - `:Q`
  - `ZZ`

To see these commands, press `h` while you are in the help screen. If you find yourself unable to exit, you can always close the terminal and restart it.

I hope this helps!
