User: when the help window pops up, what are the basic commands (mac os) to page up/down, end of document and exiting the help screen?
I just had to close my terminal as I couldn't figure it out!
Assistant: Other options to exit the help screen would be to type any one of the following(as described in the help section)
q,:q,Q,:Q and ZZ
.These can be seen when you press 'h' once you are on the help screen
