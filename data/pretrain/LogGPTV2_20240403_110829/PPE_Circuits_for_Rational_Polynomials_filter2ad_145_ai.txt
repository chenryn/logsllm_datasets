h = ((cid:80)|sα |
Case 2 (R is a YES challenge for Π & satisfies IsIdentity): Let
j=1 bj · sα [j]). We know that fℓ = Poly1ℓ · h + Poly2ℓ, hℓ =
Poly3ℓ · h + Poly4ℓ for polynomials Poly1ℓ, Poly3ℓ, where
Poly2ℓ/Poly4ℓ was replaced as the ℓth polynomial in Π′′. Consider

j bj · ˆfα [j]/Hα
evaluates to 0 for the variable assignment v. This implies, h(v) = 0.
We now break this case into 2 subcases - (2a) Π′′ (cid:44)⊥, (2b) Π′ =⊥.
Case 2(a): In this case, we want to show that R is a YES challenge

Therefore, R is a YES instance for Π′′ and satisfies the circuit
IsIdentity ∧ C′′, thus satisfying Z.
Case 2(b): We argue that this case never occurs. As Π′′ =⊥, we
know that there is an index j s.t. Poly4j is a 0 polynomial. This

element.
Case 3 (R is a NO challenge for Π & IsIdentity unsatisfied):
Since we assume R does not satisfy the circuit IsIdentity in this
case, we focus only on whether R satisfies C ∧ C′. By definition,
R is a NO challenge for Π, and therefore it cannot be a YES chal-
lenge for Π′, as both Π and Π′ share the same set of polynomials.
(Either it will be a NO challenge or an invalid challenge; the latter
in the case where the single element difference in the Trusted set
between the two problems was an improperly formed element.)

this case, we argue that R is a NO challenge for Π′′. Let h =
j bj · sα [j]). We know that fℓ = Poly1ℓ · h + Poly2ℓ, hℓ =
Poly3ℓ · h + Poly4ℓ for some polynomials Poly1ℓ, Poly3ℓ, where

C.3 Proof of Correctness for Rule 3a
Proof. Consider any PPE challenge R = (R1, R2,· · · Rm ) for
problem Π, and any testing circuits C′, C′′ for Π′, Π′′ respectively.
We first observe that R is also a valid PPE challenge for Π′ and Π′′.
This is because both share the same group structure, the number
of elements m, and the group indicator vector α. We prove that if R
is a YES challenge for Π, then it satisfies circuit Z defined above,
and if R is a NO challenge for Π, it does not satisfy the circuit Z.
We organize the proof into four cases.

Case 1 (R is a YES challenge for Π & IsIdentity unsatisfied):
We first observe that R is also a YES challenge for Π′, as Π and Π′

valid challenge; the latter in the case where the single element
difference in the Trusted set between the two problems was an
improperly formed element.) We know that, there exists an as-

fℓ = Poly1ℓ · h′ + Poly2ℓ, hℓ = Poly3ℓ · h′ + Poly4ℓ for some
polynomials Poly1ℓ, Poly3ℓ, where Poly2ℓ/Poly4ℓ is the ℓth poly-

C.4 Proof of Correctness for Rule 3b
Proof. This proof is very similar to the proof of Rule 3a. For
the sake of completeness, we present the full proof. Consider any
PPE challenge R = (R1, R2,· · · Rm ) for problem Π, and any testing
circuits C′, C′′ for Π′, Π′′ respectively. We first observe that R is
also a valid PPE challenge for Π′ and Π′′. This is because both share
the same group structure, the number of elements m, and the group
indicator vector α. We prove that if R is a YES challenge for Π, then
it satisfies circuit Z defined above, and if R is a NO challenge for
Π, it does not satisfy the circuit Z. We organize the proof into four
cases.
Case 1 (R is a YES challenge for Π & IsIdentity unsatisfied):
We first observe that R is also a YES challenge for Π′, as Π and Π′
have the same set of polynomials and only differ in the Trusted
set. As a result, R satisfies circuit C′. Also, for every satisfying
assignment v that satsifies Rℓ = д
for all ℓ, we know that
fℓ (v)/hℓ (v)
αℓ
either fk (v) (cid:44) 0 or ( fk (v) = 0 and rk = 0). Therefore, R satsifies the
circuit C, and thereby satisies the circuit (NOT IsIdentity) ∧C ∧C′,
and thus satisfies Z.
Case 2 (R is a YES challenge for Π & satisfies IsIdentity): The proof
of this case is identical to the proof of Case 2 in Rule 3a.
Case 3 (R is a NO challenge for Π & IsIdentity unsatisfied):
In this case, R is not a YES instance for Π′ as Π and Π′ share the
same set of polynomials. (Either it will be a NO challenge or an
invalid challenge; the latter in the case where the single element
difference in the Trusted set between the two problems was an im-
properly formed element.) We know that, there exists an assignment
of InTrusted variables {vi}i∈InTrusted such that Rℓ = д
fℓ (v)/hℓ (v)
αℓ
for all ℓ ∈ Trusted. As R does not satisfy the circuit IsIdentity,
h′(v) (cid:44) 0. Suppose {vi}i∈InTrusted satisfies the circuit C. It means
either fk (v) (cid:44) 0 or ( fk (v) = 0 and Rk = Iαk ). In the first case, for
every possible value of Rk and h′′, one can solve for uj such that
. This is because of our condition that d does
Rk = д
not divide p − 1. In the second case, any assignment of uj along
with {vi}i∈InTrusted satisfies Rk = д
. Consequently, there

exists a variable assignment v such that Rℓ = д

Z.
