**ATT&CK ID:** T1422  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** System Network Configuration Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to gather detailed information about the network configuration and settings of the systems they access, including both local and remote systems. This can involve discovering IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other relevant network parameters. By obtaining this information, adversaries can better understand the network topology and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
