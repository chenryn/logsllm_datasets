dyeing, the dyeing technology, and
so on. Eventually a useful contact
may be found, and the search can
continue for relevant laws and
standards concerning waste
disposal. But is it law or the
89

interpretation of the law? What if the laws are of a different country where the practices and terminologies are
different?
SEWASIE Architecture
A user should be able to access the SEWASIE system through a central user interface where (s)he are provided
with tools for query composition, for personalising search results and other web data, for visualising results,
and for communicating with other business partners about search results, e.g. in electronic negotiations.
SEWASIE Information Nodes (SINodes) are mediator-based systems, providing a virtual view of the
information sources managed within a SINode. Each SINode exports an ontology that represents the metadata
of its virtual view. These ontologies are further integrated in Brokering Agents which build the bridge
between the SINodes and the user interface. The user interface transfers queries to the Query Agents that are
intelligent information agents with the specific task of solving a query. The query agents will use the
Brokering Agents to get metadata about the SINodes, i.e. to identify the SINodes which have to queried to
answer a specific query. Monitoring Agents filter and contextualise answers of the Query Agent, possibly
linked to OLAP reports. They serve also as intelligent filters, which monitor Web sites of competitors or
potential collaborators. Finally, the Communication Tool provides the means for structured web-based
communication. It uses query results, contextualised information and ontologies from SINodes as the basis for
the communicative content. The Communication Agent performs communication tasks in the early phase of
electronic interactions.
Results
Following the design phase and the parallel development of the first core modules (query management,
ontology design, user interface) the project achieved the first integration of the core and auxiliary modules into
a first semantic search engine prototype. While several query types are already supported, more subtle and
complex query formats are being explored to define common interpretations and query management policies.
Techniques have been studied and tested to improve the workflow at the user end, at the intermediary level,
and at the source end. This is particularly significant both from the design and development point of view,
since it extends the general “ergonomics” of the system. It is also significant from a general economics point of
view, since the deployment of the system in a real work environment will require an enterprise or even sector-
level strategy to achieve an opportunity threshold whereby the users perceive the system as a useful tool to
use due to available content and quality of results, with a favourable cost/benefits ratio.
The extended features of the system include negotiation systems, OLAP systems, monitoring and visualization
components. All of these are being integrated with the basic search engine user interface to provide an
integrated user environment where sophisticated analysis and processing may be performed. This may
require substantial user interaction, like in a negotiation system where results from a query for suppliers of
certain goods are injected to allow the establishment of (possibly several) contacts leading to competitive bids
and a final contract. Alternatively, it may require no or minimal user participation while monitoring a certain
information domain for specific events to occur, the events being defined as changes to the information
content of some sources, content whose presence or absence may be decided with a query which is repeated
periodically.
User testing is under way and more testing is currently being planned to validate the integrated system in
more and more complex and demanding environments. The first test activities focused on the textile sector of
a dynamic industrial district in the province of Modena (Italy), involving CNA and SMEs, and in collaboration
with some medium-sized German firms (specifically for the OLAP, monitoring, and visualization modules). A
second test plan is being finalised to focus on a mechanical high tech industry (moulding of plastic and metal).
More details on the results of the project have been published in several publications, see the project web site
(http://www.sewasie.org) for a complete list.

Call for Posters and Software Demos
The ESWC 2005 Program Committee invites proposals for the demonstrations and poster program. This
program is intended to showcase innovative Semantic Web related implementations and technologies.
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of their innovation, relevance, scientific contribution, reusability,
and presentation, by an international committee.
Areas of Interest
-----------------
We would like to encourage the submission of proposals for demonstrations of software related to any areas
of the Semantic Web. Areas of interest related to Semantic Web technology include, but are
not limited to:
* Social Software and Portals
* Semantic Desktop Systems and Tools
* P2P systems
* Annotation tools
* Novel query and browsing interfaces
* Data visualization
* Ontology development environments
* Ontology libraries and management systems
* Tools for merging, integrating or articulating ontologies
* Tools for merging, integrating or articulating instance data
* Reusable components and APIs for RDF, DAML+OIL, OWL, etc.
* Repositories and inference systems
* Applications
* Agent systems embedded in the Semantic Web
93
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
* Systems that identify and compose web services
Requested Contributions We are looking for contributions whose nature make them less suited for submission
to the official paper track. We would like to emphasize this point and make clear that the poster session is
more than a second chance for a rejected paper.
In particular, we ask for contributions of the following kind:
* Late-breaking and Speculative Results:
Significant and original ideas and promising approaches to resolve open problems in semantic web research
that are in an early stage and have not been verified and tested sufficiently to meet the requirements of a
scientific publication. Submissions in this area will be evaluated like a scientific paper but limited to the
aspects of originality, relevance and significance.
* Systems and Infrastructure:
Descriptions (preferably accompanied by demonstration) of new systems that use semantic web technology to
solve important real world problems. We are also looking for software infrastructure supporting
the development of systems that use semantic web technologies. Systems will be evaluated based on novelty
and significance of the application as well as the use of semantic web technologies for solving the problem.
Main criteria for contributions on infrastructure is successful use in existing applications as well as
uniqueness of the provided services.
* Projects and Initiatives:
Descriptions of the objectives and results of ongoing projects and initiatives. The aim is to provide an
overview of ongoing work in the area of the semantic web. Contributions in this area will be evaluated based
on the importance and uniqueness of the objectives. Further criteria for project descriptions are the
significance of results, descriptions of initiatives will also be evaluated with
respect to the expected impact on the community .

Second International Workshop on Semantic and Dynamic Web Process
http://dme.uma.pt/jcardoso/Research/Conferences/SDWP05/
In conjunction with the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS'2005), July 12-15, 2005,
Orlando, Florida, USA
SDWP Workshop aims and Objectives
----------------------------------
Organizations are increasingly faced with the challenge of managing e-business systems and e-commerce
applications managing Web services and Web processes. Web services promise universal interoperability and
integration.Several researchers agree that it is essential for Web services to be machine understandable in
order to support all the phases of the lifecycle of Web processes. The intelligent combination of Web services
and the Semantic Web can start off a technological revolution with the development of Semantic Web
Processes. These processes can bring together autonomous and heterogeneous applications, data, services, and
components residing in distributed environments. These technological advances can ultimately lead to a new
breed of Web-based applications.The major goal of the workshop is to bring researchers, scientists from both
industry and academics, and representatives from different communities together to study, understand, and
explore the phases that compose the lifecycle of Semantic Web Processes.In particular, we wish to emphasize
the research and technological issues related to supporting more flexible, dynamic and scalable Web processes
to meet the advanced needs of the organizational processes in the networked global economy.
Last year workshop – SWSWPC 2004
--------------------------------
Last year workshop (SWSWPC 2004) intended to bring researchers, scientists from both industry and
academics, and representatives from different communities together to study, understand, and explore the
phases that compose the lifecycle of Semantic Web Processes.The rich material discussed at the workshop, and
the members of the Program Committee who have reviewed and assessed the scientific merit of each submitted
paper, have ensured high quality standards. As a result, Springer-Verlag will publish the contributions in the
Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (Volume 3387, lunch date Feb. 2005).
Topics of Interest
------------------
The theme of the workshop is: Semantic and Dynamic Web Processes. One of the main points of this
workshop is to focus on one of the most promising solution to support all Web Process lifecycle phases, the
use semantics. Semantics include rich descriptions of Web services and Web processes that can be used by
computers for automatic processing in various applications. While enterprises have sought to apply semantics
to manage and exploit data or content, for example to support data integration, Web Processes are the way to
exploit their applications, increasingly made interoperable as Web Services.
Submissions are invited that focus specifically on the challenges in applying semantics to each of the steps in
the Semantic Web Process lifecycle. In particular we present the role of semantics in:
- Annotation (Semantic Annotation of Web Services)
- Discovery (Semantic Web Service Discovery)
- Composition (Semantic Process Composition)
95
AIS SIGSEMIS Bulletin 2(1) January-March 2005
- Process Execution/Enactment (Semantic Web Process Orchestration), and Quality of Service of Semantic
Web Processes
We invite researchers and experts of web service and semantics to submit original research papers as well as
reports on work in progress related to Semantic Web Process lifecycle. Suggested topics include but are not
restricted to:
- Semantic Web Processes
- Dynamic Web Processes
- Web Processes Lifecyle
- Use of Semantics in Annotation, Discovery, Composition, and Orchestration of Web Services and Processes
- Semantic Selection of Web Services
- Semantic Web Process Quality of Service
- Dynamic Changes and Composition of Semantic Web Processes
- Web Process Reasoning
- Web Processes Complexity
- Ontological representation of QoS and Execution Semantics
- Exploiting Domain Specific Semantics for Web Services (e.g. domains include, but not limited to,
bioinformatics, telecommunication, travel, financial, and legal)
- SOA and Grid Computing with dynamic allocation and semantics
- Workflow Technologies and Semantics
- Standards extensions (incl. WSDL, UDDI, BPEL) to support dynamic evolution/changes, and semantics
Paper Submission and Review
---------------------------
Research papers should not exceed 5000 words (approximately 12 pages). Short papers (up to 6 pages)
describing early research results are also welcome. Submitted papers must not overlap with papers that have
been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings.Papers
submitted to the workshop will undergo a peer-review process. The workshop proceedings will be published
electronically and made available from the Association for Information Systems, SIG on Semantic Web and
Information Systems AIS SIGSEMIS, http://www.sigsemis.org.
Arrangements will be made with Kluwer Academic to possibly produce a book based on a selection of papers
presented at the workshop. Therefore, papers should be prepared in Kluwer Academic's book chapter format.
In particular, authors should check
http://dme.uma.pt/jcardoso/Research/Conferences/SDWP05/submission.html for further information.
On this year's edition, we have set up an online submission and reviewing system so that the whole track
