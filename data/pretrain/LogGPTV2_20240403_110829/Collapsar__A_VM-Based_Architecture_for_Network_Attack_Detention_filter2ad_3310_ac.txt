### Important Observations from Figures 3(a) and 3(b)

A key observation from Figures 3(a) and 3(b) is that traffic redirection and dispatching in Collapsar result in a significant network performance penalty compared to direct communication (as shown by the "Direct" curve). For remote intruders or those behind a weak link, this penalty may be masked by the already degraded end-to-end network performance. However, for "nearby" intruders, the penalty can be noticeable when compared to the performance of a real host in the same network. This is a limitation of the Collapsar design. Router-based traffic redirection (Section 4.1) and future hardware-based virtualization technologies are expected to mitigate this issue.

### Experiments with Collapsar

In this section, we present several real-world network attack incidents captured by our Collapsar testbed. We also detail the recorded intruder activities to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of Collapsar. Finally, we showcase the potential of Collapsar in log mining and event correlation.

#### 6.1 Attack Case Study

Our Collapsar testbed includes five production networks: three Ethernet LANs, one wireless LAN, and one DSL network. The Collapsar center is located in another Ethernet LAN and hosts virtual honeypots running various operating systems, including RedHat Linux 7.2/8.0, Windows XP Home Edition, FreeBSD 4.2, and Solaris 8.0. Prior to Collapsar operation, the md5sum of every file in each honeypot (except for the Windows honeypot) was calculated and stored for future reference. For each representative attack incident, we examine the specific vulnerability, describe how the system was compromised, and detail the intruder's activities post-compromise. It is important to note that these attacks are well-known and have been previously reported. Our goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Collapsar in handling real-world attacks.

##### 6.1.1 Linux/VMware Honeypot

The first recorded incident involved an attack on an Apache server version 1.3.20-16 running on RedHat 7.2 with the Linux kernel 2.4.7-10. The compromised honeypot was a VMware-based virtual machine in the Collapsar center, logically present in one of the LAN production networks.

**Vulnerability Description:**
Apache web server versions up to and including 1.3.24 contain a vulnerability [14] in the chunk-handling routines. A carefully crafted invalid request can cause an Apache child process to call the `memcpy()` function in a way that writes past the end of its buffer, corrupting the stack and resulting in a stack overflow. Remote intruders can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, leading to a system compromise.

This detailed analysis of the attack demonstrates the importance of Collapsar in detecting and mitigating such vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing network security.
