### Finalizing the Framework and Credibility Checks
We finalized our framework by coding and theming the data [17]. To ensure the accuracy and clarity of our framework and findings, we conducted credibility checks. Seven experts with experience working with at-risk populations reviewed a draft of this paper and provided feedback during a discussion session. All experts found the framework to be sound and useful.

### Limitations
Our dataset, comprising 95 papers, is not exhaustive of all relevant publications in the fields of security, privacy, and human-computer interaction (HCI). However, given our systematic approach to compiling these papers, the dataset should reasonably represent the published understanding of at-risk users within these communities. The dataset is heavily skewed towards Western, particularly U.S., populations, reflecting the current state of literature. Additionally, perspectives from other fields, especially the social sciences, could offer valuable insights into the digital safety of at-risk populations. (For details on geographic representation and researcher reflexivity, see the appendix.)

As research methods and best practices for understanding at-risk users are still evolving and often differ between communities, the papers in our dataset do not always focus on the same issues or investigate to the same depth. Consequently, our synthesis of contextual risk factors, protective practices, and barriers may not capture all the challenges faced by the population in question. Our coding reflects the current understanding in the sampled literature for each population.

Despite these limitations, we believe this work serves as a critical first step toward recognizing contextual risk factors and protective practices that span at-risk users. We advocate for future research that builds on this framework by incorporating broader literature and cultural perspectives.

### Contextual Risk Factors
In our meta-analysis, we identified 10 contextual risk factors that augment or amplify digital-safety risks. These factors, which form the first component of our at-risk framework, include:
- **Societal Factors**: Influenced by an at-risk user’s role in their society and culture.
- **Relationship Factors**: Stemming from who an at-risk user knows or interacts with.
- **Personal Circumstances**: Dependent on who an at-risk user is or their personal or professional activities.

We note some common attacks associated with each risk factor but do not consider being the target of a digital attack alone as a risk factor. Table I captures the presence of these risk factors within the papers from our dataset. A black circle (●) indicates that at least one prior study of an at-risk population reported risks related to that factor. The absence of a black circle for an at-risk population in Table I does not imply that the risk factor is irrelevant; it only means that it was not reported in our dataset.

### Societal Factors
The first set of contextual risk factors involves societal factors driven by cultures and institutions. Attacks related to societal risk factors tend to be diffusely targeted, directed toward anyone in a population or an entire at-risk population simultaneously, rather than at a specific person.

#### Legal or Political
The government, political affairs, or laws of a country can contribute to heightened digital-safety risks for at-risk populations, including sophisticated attacks from government actors. A key theme associated with this factor is the power differential between government or quasi-governmental actors and the targeted populations.

Government or quasi-government actors may intercept communications from at-risk populations through various means, such as physically seizing devices or data [55, 67], impersonating trusted entities [59], coercing platform or telephony providers to bypass security measures [90], or preventing internet access entirely [25]. For example, in 2019, the Sudanese government shut off the country’s mobile data network to make organizing for activism as difficult as possible [25].

Similarly, the International Committee of the Red Cross, a non-governmental organization (NGO) that collects information potentially used by armed groups for non-humanitarian intelligence, reported being obligated to physically surrender devices to meet with those armed groups [55].

Governments may also enact surveillance, leading to real or perceived threats of monitoring. For instance, undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have expressed concern about posting their activities on social media due to perceived government monitoring [40]. More generally, residents of several countries with government-controlled internet surveillance have reported modifying their behavior [46, 89, 109].

Due to the power differential, threats associated with this factor may escalate into offline harms, such as detention, incarceration, or deportation [25, 40]. These harms may also have wide-ranging societal impacts, including restricted or self-censored speech [49, 101] or lasting damage to trust in public institutions or figures [21, 68]. For example, attacks on people involved with U.S. political campaigns were described as intending to undermine the institution of U.S. elections [21].

#### Marginalization
Pervasive negative treatment or exclusion at a societal level, due to an individual’s identity attributes or life experiences, may also elevate digital-safety risks. We use the term "attacker" broadly to refer to anyone who introduces digital-safety issues for an at-risk user, regardless of the severity or intention.
