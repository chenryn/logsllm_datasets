### Version
2.6.10
### Reproduction link
https://codepen.io/meekohi/pen/jjgezj
### Steps to reproduce
Use `@click.prevent=` along with a `:checked='booleanComponentProp'` on a
checkbox. Clicking the checkbox correctly updates all data, but the checkbox
visually remains in whatever the original state was.
### What is expected?
Checkbox should update based on the `:checked` property.
### What is actually happening?
Checkbox does not update.

This bug did not exist in Vue 2.5.22 -- it seems like Vue 2.6 started relying
on the native `click` event to change the state of the box for the simple
case, but if the underlying property changes via some other mechanism (for
example a prop updating) then the checkbox visual appearance gets out of sync
with the underlying data.
