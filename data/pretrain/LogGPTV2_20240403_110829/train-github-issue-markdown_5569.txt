Hi, I have one question  
In our react component, we choose to discard using `bable-plugin-transform-
runtime`,  
so that we are building a duplicating code lib like `function _classCallCheck
() ={} ; _classCallCheck()` ...  
but we have a plan, in our engineering, we are using bable-plugin-transform-
runtime to transform `function _classCallCheck () ={} ; _classCallCheck()`
with `babel/runtime` under `node_modules` by webpack config, emm...something
like:
    {
        test: /\.(js|jsx)?$/,
        exclude: /node_modules\/(?!(@music)\/).*/,
            use: [{
                 loader: 'babel-loader',
                 options: {}
            }]
    },
However, by looking into the packaged code, I found the duplicated codes is
still exist, may i know how `bable-plugin-transform-runtim` works with `bable-
runtime` ?  
or our plan is wrong ? many thanks :)
