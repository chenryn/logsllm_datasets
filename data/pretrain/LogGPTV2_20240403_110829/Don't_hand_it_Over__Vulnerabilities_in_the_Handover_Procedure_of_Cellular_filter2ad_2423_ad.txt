regarding the handover exploitation, by illustrating how handover
attacks can take place.
5.1 Intra-Base Station Handovers
In this part we describe the general form of the Intra-Base station
attack which applies to LTE and 5G, see Figure 2. The figure also
shows the exploited weaknesses represented in red circles according
to Section 4.3.
Initially, the UE transmits and receives traffic as normal while
being in an RRC-Connected state. Normal traffic is related to a
service that could be a voice call, data, SMS exchange, etc. The
duration in which the UE remains in the RRC-Connected state
varies and it chiefly depends on the configured RRC inactivity
timer. Furthermore, the source and target cells belong to the same
eNodeB/gNodeB. An attacker that emulates the target cell tries to
disrupt the normal traffic and execute a handover attack that will
make the UE attach to the malicious cell.
Once the MR is sent to the source cell containing false measure-
ments about the target cell, the source cell will wrongly accept it
Figure 2: Intra-Handover attack
and initiate a series of RRC Reconfiguration messages and possible
RRC Reestablishment messages to synchronization purposes as pre-
sented in steps 2 and 3. The reason behind this potentially lengthy
exchange of RRC messages is that the attack destabilizes the con-
nection and the transition from the source cell to the bogus cell
becomes turbulent. Ideally, to synchronize to a target cell in Intra-
Base station handovers, a single exchange of RRC Reconfiguration
and RRC Reconfiguration Complete messages is adequate. Finally,
the UE will disconnect from the source cell and initiate a connec-
tion to the false cell. The disconnection happens immediately after
the UE receives an RRC Reconfiguration message, which signifies
the lack of cross-validations on the network side. Then, the source
cell may notify the MME/AMF about the abnormal disconnection
of the user by sending a UE Context Release with cause "Radio
Connection with UE lost", as also shown in Figure 8. It should be
specified that in most cases the RAN network may experience a
handover T_RELOC_OVERALL timer expiry close to the moment
of disconnection too.
Thereafter, the UE will begin the attachment with an RRC Reestab-
lishment Request (step 5). The reestablishment cause is usually a
handoverFailure or otherCause since the UE cannot properly attach
to the rogue cell, especially through the intended RACH procedure.
Figure 6 shows such an RRC Reestablishment Request. In this case,
an RRC Reestablishment Reject/RRC Reject (step 6) can make the
UE begin a new RRC Connection Setup (step 7) normalizing the
connection. On the side of the Core Network, the UE appears to be
905Don’t hand it Over: Vulnerabilities in the Handover Procedure of Cellular Telecommunications
ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
deregistered in an abnormal way, therefore paging messages may
be sent from the Core Network to all available cells, in order to
locate the user. However, these messages will fail since the UE is
attached to the attacker. Once the new RRC connection is ready, the
UE attempts to quickly recover the disrupted service because of the
attack by transmitting one or multiple Service Request messages
(step 8). The attacker must reject the service (step 9), since not only
Service Accept messages are security protected and the attacker
does not possess the UE Security Context, but also he/she cannot
offer legitimate services to the users.
Moreover, considering that the attacker would want to achieve
a stable and exploitable connection with the UE, after a series of
failed service recoveries, he/she can leverage a compelling RRC
Connection Release with waitTime 1 second in order to make the
UE connect anew (step 9). Consequently, in all of our experimental
attempts, we noticed that the UE promptly reconnects with an RRC
Connection Setup and sends an NAS Attach Request to the attacker
(steps 11 and 12). The UE believes that the Attach Request will be
received by the legitimate Core Network through a legitimate base
station, but this is not the case.
Given the above steps, the attacker has two options based on
his/her goals: Either forward the Attach Request and all the follow-
ing downlink and uplink traffic in order to establish a MitM relay, or
perform a DoS attack by responding with an Attach Reject. Accord-
ing to our assessment, the UE enters into a DoS mode after a few
attach rejections without recovering. A reboot or airplane mode is
necessary, even though the UE also needs to "escape" the attacker’s
coverage. Finally, it should be mentioned that the UE-initiated mes-
sages are sent on the attacker’s side along with sensitive data such as
the IMSI, TMSI and UE capabilities. IMEI/PEI could also be exposed
if the UE is instructed by the malicious network to authenticate
with the equipment identifier. Therefore, user’s private information
are invaded too.
5.2 Inter-Base Station Handovers
Akin to the Intra-Base station cases, we now determine the general
form of Inter-Base station handovers on LTE and 5G, see Figure 3.
We include the S1/X2 (Intra-RAT), N2/Xn (Intra-RAT), and EPS fall-
back (Inter-RAT) handover cases. Once again, we start by having a
UE in RRC-Connected state with a normal network communication.
Nonetheless, the source and target cells now belong to different
eNodeBs/gNodeBs. Thus in this scenario, the attacker emulates the
target cell of a target eNodeB/gNodeB.
Upon receiving the fraudulent MR, the source cell checks if
the measurements meet the handover trigger threshold, then the
source eNodeB/gNodeB searches the Neighbour Cell Relation Ta-
ble with the reported PCI, and finds the target cell of the target
eNodeB/gNodeB. The source cell believes that this PCI applies to
a legitimate base station and proceeds with the handover prepara-
tion phase in step 2, however the PCI is associated with the rogue
cell from UE’s viewpoint. The general structure of the preparation
phase is very similar to the aforementioned cases, with few differ-
ences. In X2 and Xn, there is direct link of communication between
the base stations; therefore a Handover Request and a Handover
Acknowledgement are sufficient. In cases where there is no direct
link, like in S1, N2 and EPS Fallback, the traffic goes through the
Figure 3: Inter-Handover attack
MME/AMF, beginning with a Handover Required message. In any
case, the source cell tries to prepare the target cell for the han-
dover, and when ready it sends an RRC Reconfiguration message
(HO Command) to the UE to force a handover (step 3). In spite of
that, the UE disconnects from the source cell and connects to the
false cell due to the lack of verification mechanisms. Additionally,
it is possible that the source cell will send a UE Context Release
due to disconnection like in Intra-Base station handovers. Finally,
when the attack affects UE’s communication and destabilizes it, the
source cell may cancel the handover procedure during the prepara-
tion phase more than once. Once again, this is an indication that a
smooth transition might not be conceivable leaving traces behind.
Similar to Section 5.1, the UE attempts a connection to the rogue
cell with an RRC Reestablishment Request (step 5) and the attacker
responds accordingly (step 6). Next, the UE initiates an RRC Con-
nection Setup with the malicious cell to retain attachment (step 7).
In LTE, the UE also sends two to three NAS TAU Requests that are
declined by the attacker (steps 8 & 9). A rejection cause that can be
used in TAU reject messages is the "UE cannot be derived by the
network" which will force the UE to connect anew. To amplify this
result an RRC Connection Release message waitTime 1 second is a
suitable option as shown in step 10. The attacker should also reject
any Service Requests sent by the UE, even though we did not detect
any such message during our experimentation, since any service
has been dropped by now. On the network side, a handover failure
occurs because the real target cell did not complete the intended
RACH procedure with the UE and the source cell did not receive
906ACSAC ’21, December 6–10, 2021, Virtual Event, USA
Evangelos Bitsikas and Christina Pöpper
the UE Context Release from the target cell. Eventually, the Core
Network may transmit paging messages to locate the user who is
missing, hoping for an RLF report that will match the registered
handover failure but not until the UE reconnects to it.
Thereafter, the UE begins a new RRC connection with the rogue
cell and sends a NAS Attach Request in order to freshly register
(steps 11 and 12). Once again, the UE’s false trust has consequences
identical to Intra-Base station cases. The attacker can forward mes-
sages to establish a MitM relay or reject the attachment forcing a
DoS attack. Similarly, privacy issues are still present as the UE sends
sensitive information to the attacker during the whole process.
5.3 Special Handover Cases
Likewise, special handover cases are designed with the same se-
curity flaws. In CU-DU handover cases, the principal factor for a
transition from a source CU/DU to a target CU/DU is once again the
MR [6]. As a DU may control one or more cells and the handover
procedure remains the same, we suspect that Intra/Inter-CU and
Intra/Inter-DU handovers can be affected similar to the Intra- and
Inter-Base Station handovers presented above.
Conditional handovers [10] rely on the UE to make the decision
on which target cell it should attach to. The source base station
provides the trigger events and thresholds to the UE via the RRC
Reconfiguration message while it prepares the candidate targets for
a potential handover. If the UE discovers a trigger event and a suit-
able cell based on its measurements, then it initiates the execution
phase of the handover and establishes a connection. This means
that this process is still based on MRs and signal power, therefore
we believe that the attacks can be carried out in the same fashion
as previously. The difference here is the UE which sends an RRC
Reconfiguration Complete to the source cell right after receiving
the RRC Reconfiguration message and before disconnection.
6 EXPERIMENTATION
6.1 The Setup
which is
As Figure 4 shows, our setup consists of computer
the Amarisoft Callbox Classic (equipped with SDRs) [19] with the
EPC/5G Core Network and the eNodeB/gNodeB representing the le-
gitimate network. In addition, we have computer
with another
legitimate Amarisoft eNodeB/gNodeB using a Lenovo Thinkpad
T580 laptop with Ubuntu 20.04 and an Ettus B210 USRP [41]. The
two computers are connected in the same network via Ethernet
and their cellular interfaces are set according to Amarisoft doc-
umentation. For the UE, we used the Oneplus 6, Apple iPhone
5, Samsung S10 5G and Huawei Pro P40 5G with an Anritsu sim
card. Furthermore, the attacker’s machine comprises a Dell Latitude
E5450 laptop with Ubuntu 20.04 and an Ettus B210 USRP with a
total cost of 2k €. In our setup, the attacker can use srsLTE for
LTE cases and Amarisoft software for the LTE and 5G cases with
a Core Network and a single eNodeB/gNodeB. More details about
our cellular network configurations are presented in Section D of
the Appendix.

6.2 Requirements, Scenarios, Target Handovers
In our experimentation we emulated three scenarios where the UE
is in RRC-Connected state and interacts normally with the network.
The first one was a data transfer through iperf [34] as suggested by
the Amarisoft documentation, while the second one was a regular
IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) SIP call service and a third one
was the Short Message Service (SMS). For iperf we had to initiate
a server/receiver on the network side and a client/sender on the
UE side while the mobile data were enabled. Moreover, IMS calls
were possible through the IMS terminal by carrying out the mt_call
command and SMS messages through the sms command.
We applied the above scenarios to LTE, 5G NSA and 5G SA, while
using all four smartphones for LTE, Samsung S10 and Huawei P40
for 5G NSA, and Huawei P40 for 5G SA. Unfortunately, we were
not able to experiment on Inter-RAT cases that involve 2G (GSM)
