User: How to configure the firewall rules of the Linux system? Please provide specific steps.
Assistant: In Linux systems, commonly used firewall software are iptables and firewalld. The following describes their configuration methods. 1. iptables iptables is a built-in firewall software in the Linux system, and rules can be configured through the command line. 1.1 View the current rules You can use the following command to view the current firewall rules: ``` iptables -L -n ``` 1.2 Add rules For example, if you want to open the SSH port (that is, port 22), you can use the following command to add rules: ``` iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT ``` Among them, -A means adding rules, INPUT means the direction of data inflow, -p tcp means use tcp protocol, --dport 22 means the destination port is 22, -j ACCEPT means allow to pass. 1.3 Delete a rule If you want to delete a rule, you can use the following command: ``` iptables -D INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT ``` Among them, -D means delete the rule. 1.4 Save the rules In order to keep the rules in the next restart, you can use the following command to save the rules: ``` service iptables save ``` 2. firewalld firewalld is a relatively new firewall software in the Linux system, and the rules can also be configured through the command line. 2.1 Check the zone currently used You can use the following command to check the zone currently used by the system: ``` firewall-cmd --get-default-zone ``` 2.2 Add rules For example, if you want to open the SSH port (that is, port 22), you can Use the following command to add rules: ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=22/tcp --permanent ``` Among them, --zone means the zone used, --add-port means add port , --permanent means to save the rules permanently. 2.3 Delete a rule If you want to delete a rule, you can use the following command: ``` firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=22/tcp --permanent ``` 2.4 Reload the rule in order to make the modified rule Effective immediately, the rules can be reloaded with: ``` firewall-cmd --reload ```
