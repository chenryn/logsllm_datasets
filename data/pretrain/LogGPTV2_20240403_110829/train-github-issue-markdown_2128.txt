##  **What keywords did you search in Kubernetes issues before filing this
one?** (If you have found any duplicates, you should instead reply there.):  
azure load balancer
**Is this a BUG REPORT or FEATURE REQUEST?** (choose one): Kind of both  
**Kubernetes version** (use `kubectl version`): current master
**Environment** :
  * **Cloud provider or hardware configuration** : azure
  * **OS** (e.g. from /etc/os-release): CentOS 7.2
  * **Kernel** (e.g. `uname -a`): Linux ma-k8s-0 3.10.0-327.36.3.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Mon Oct 24 16:09:20 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
  * **Install tools** : custom Ansible+kubeadm
  * **Others** :
**What happened** :  
The Azure cloud provider complains with "loadbalancer is misconfigured with a
different backend pool" when I add custom load balancer rules with separate
backend pools through the Azure Portal or through Azure Resource Templates. I
need to add these custom rules to expose the Kubernetes API endpoints. Adding
a dedicated Azure Load Balancer just for the API is not possible, as otherwise
I get error messages about Azure Load Balancer limitations (only one LB
allowed per Availability Set)
**What you expected to happen** :  
I would have expected that the Azure Cloud Provider just ignores existing
backend pools.
**How to reproduce it** (as minimally and precisely as possible):  
As described in "What happened"
**Anything else do we need to know** :  
I created a fix for this and am currently testing this. I will create a PR in
a few minutes when everything goes well.
I created this issue before finishing the PR because I wanted to discuss the
reason behind this limitation?
