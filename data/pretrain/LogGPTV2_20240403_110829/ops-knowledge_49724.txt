User: How to monitor server performance indicators, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage? Please provide a monitoring solution.
Assistant: One monitoring solution is to use Zabbix, which is an open source network monitoring software. The following are the steps to use Zabbix to monitor server performance indicators: 1. Install Zabbix server and Zabbix agent: Zabbix server is the center of monitoring data, and Zabbix agent is software installed on the monitored server. 2. Configure monitoring items: Create monitoring items in Zabbix to monitor server performance indicators. For example, you can set CPU utilization, memory usage, and disk space usage. 3. Create a trigger: For each monitoring item, create a corresponding trigger so that an alarm can be issued when the indicator value exceeds a certain threshold. 4. Configure alarm: Set the alarm method in Zabbix, such as notifying the administrator by email, SMS or other means that action needs to be taken. 5. View monitoring data: Use Zabbix web interface to view charts, historical data and alarm status of server performance indicators. Through these steps, a complete monitoring system can be established to track the performance indicators of the server.
