# Environment
    Windows build number: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18990.1]
    Windows Terminal version (if applicable): Version: 0.5.2681.0
# Steps to reproduce
Copy text with `\` line break. Example:
    libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libffi-dev \
    wget curl libldap2-dev zlib1g-dev lib32z1-dev uuid-dev
Paste it on powershell or wsl console.
# Expected behavior
Terminal should recognize `\` as a line break and should execute the whole
code as it does on powershell or wsl console directly.

individually immediately causing a unexpected results.
