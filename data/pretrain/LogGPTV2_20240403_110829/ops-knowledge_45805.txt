User: I have a service provider who is transmitting data thro' UDP. I want to establish a connection to them, receive & process data (will be with in the 30 sec limit/request)
Is it possible to get & process UDP data in appengine. I am looking for some simple example.
Assistant: You could run a separate agent on a cloud host like DigitalOcean or Amazon EC2 that proxies this protocol and makes itself available to Google App Engine via ordinary HTTP or web sockets.
