**ATT&CK ID:** T1040  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Network Sniffing

Adversaries may use network sniffing to capture sensitive information about an environment, including authentication credentials transmitted over the network. Network sniffing involves using a system's network interface to monitor or capture data sent over both wired and wireless connections. To perform this technique, an adversary may configure a network interface to promiscuous mode, allowing it to passively intercept and access data in transit. Additionally, they might use span ports to capture a broader range of network traffic, thereby increasing the amount of data they can collect.
