Certainly! Here's a more polished and professional version of your text:

I am using Python, and my code runs smoothly with the non-portable version. However, I need to run the program on a computer that does not belong to me, and this computer does not have Python installed or the option to install it.

To address this, I am using a portable version of Python. However, the code that previously worked without issues now throws an error: "WindowsError: [Error 3] The system cannot find the path specified." I have verified that the code runs without errors on my own computer.

The command I am using is:
```python
p = subprocess.Popen(self.cmdStr, shell=False, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=file)
```
I am redirecting `stderr` to a specified file.

I have also searched online and found discussions about "subprocess PATH semantics and portability," but I am unsure if this is the root cause of my issue. Could anyone provide some insight?

Additionally, I have noticed that using the following command works correctly:
```python
subprocess.Popen(r"C:\Python27\python.exe", shell=True)
```

Thank you for any help you can provide.
