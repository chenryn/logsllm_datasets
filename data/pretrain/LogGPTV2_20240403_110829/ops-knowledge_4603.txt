User: Actually, we can simply install python-dev on linux just use the following command:
sudo apt-get install python-dev
since python is integrated with Linux. But no such luck on windows. For input "pip install python-dev", there is no corresponding package on pypi.python.org.
What packages should I install to match those when installed by "apt-get install python-dev" command under Linux on Windows?
Assistant: python-dev installs the headers and libraries for linux, allowing you to write / compile extensions.
In windows, the standard installer provides this by default.  The header files are in the $installroot\include directory.  The link libraries are found in $installroot\libs.
For example I've installed python 2.7 into c:\python27.  This means my include files are located here: c:\python27\include.  And the link libraries are in c:\python27\libs
