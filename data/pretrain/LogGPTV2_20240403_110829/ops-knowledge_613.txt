### Should an Admin User Be Able to Edit Passwords?

For a typical web application, the question of whether an admin superuser should have the right to edit a user's password (while not being able to see the current password) can be broken down into three related sub-questions:

1. **Should an admin user be able to view a user's password?**
   - **No.** This is a significant security risk and should be avoided. Users may reuse passwords across multiple sites, and exposing a password through the admin interface could compromise their security on other platforms.
   - Additionally, allowing an admin to view passwords would require storing them in plain text or using a reversible encryption method, both of which are poor security practices. Passwords should always be stored as hashed values to ensure that even if the database is breached, the actual passwords remain secure.

2. **Should an admin user be able to reset a user's password?**
   - **Yes.** This is a useful and common feature. An admin should be able to trigger a password reset process, such as sending an email to the user with a link to set a new password or generating a temporary password and emailing it to the user.
   - It is important that the system does not display the new password to the admin. The user should receive a notification that their password has been reset, and this action should be logged, including the identity of the admin who initiated the reset.

3. **Should an admin user be able to set a user's password?**
   - **Yes.** This functionality can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when creating new user accounts or when a user needs immediate access and cannot wait for a password reset email.
   - In these cases, the admin should be able to generate a new password, enter it into the system, and communicate it to the user via a secure, out-of-band channel (e.g., over the phone). Alternatively, the admin could allow the user to type in their preferred new password directly.
   - As with password resets, the user should receive a notification that their password has been set by an admin, and the action should be logged, including the identity of the admin.

In summary, while an admin should never be able to view a user's password, they should have the ability to reset or set a user's password, provided that the new password is not visible to the admin and the user is notified of the change. These measures help maintain security while providing necessary administrative functionality.
