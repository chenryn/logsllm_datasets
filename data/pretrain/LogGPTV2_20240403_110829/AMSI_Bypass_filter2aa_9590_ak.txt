### Nishang Script for Bypassing/ Avoiding AMSI

#### Description
This script implements publicly known methods to bypass or avoid the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) on Windows machines. AMSI is a built-in script malware detection mechanism that is enabled by default in Windows 10. For more information, refer to the [official documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889587(v=vs.85).aspx).

The script includes six methods for bypassing AMSI:

1. **Unload** - A method developed by Matt Graeber that unloads AMSI from the current PowerShell session.
2. **Unload2** - Another method by Matt Graeber that unloads AMSI from the current PowerShell session.
3. **UnloadSilent** - A method by Matt Graeber that unloads AMSI and avoids Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0's automatic logging.
4. **UnloadObfuscated** - The "Unload" method, obfuscated using Daniel Bohannon's Invoke-Obfuscation, which also avoids WMF 5.0's automatic logging.
5. **DllHijack** - A method by Cornelis de Plaa that uses an `amsi.dll` file from p0wnedShell. For more details, see the [p0wnedShell GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cn33liz/p0wnedShell).
6. **PSv2** - If .NET 2.0.50727 is available on the Windows 10 machine, this method launches PowerShell v2, which does not support AMSI.

Additionally, the script provides information on tools that can be used for obfuscation:
- **ISE-Steroids**: [Download here](http://www.powertheshell.com/isesteroidsmanual/download/)
- **Invoke-Obfuscation**: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation)

#### Parameters
- **Method**: Specifies the method to be used for bypassing AMSI. The default method is `UnloadSilent`.
- **ShowOnly**: When set, the script will only display the bypass method without executing it.

#### Examples
1. **Run the Default Method (`UnloadSilent`)**:
   ```powershell
   PS > Invoke-AmsiBypass -Verbose
   ```

2. **Run a Specific Method (`UnloadObfuscated`)**:
   ```powershell
   PS > Invoke-AmsiBypass -Method UnloadObfuscated -Verbose
   ```

By following these examples, you can effectively bypass or avoid AMSI on Windows machines using the provided methods.
