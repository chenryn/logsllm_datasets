User: Spinning off from another thread, when is it appropriate to use os.system() to issue commands like rm -rf, cd, make, xterm, ls ?
Considering there are analog versions of the above commands (except make and xterm), I'm assuming it's safer to use these built-in python commands instead of using os.system()
Any thoughts? I'd love to hear them.
Assistant: Rule of thumb: if there's a built-in Python function to achieve this functionality use this function. Why? It makes your code portable across different systems, more secure and probably faster as there will be no need to spawn an additional process.
