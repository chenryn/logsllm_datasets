Feature request: Emacs has a cool feature called "prettify symbols mode,"
demonstrated for Haskell here. This could also subsume #192.
The basic idea is to register a sequence of characters whose glyphs will be
replaced with another glyph, but the original characters still appear in the
text document. Ideally, the substitutions would be dependent on the context
returned by a syntax highlighter or some other parser.
