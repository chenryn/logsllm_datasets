User:  Given a large database, please design an indexing scheme that meets business needs.
Assistant: First of all, you need to understand the business requirements and database design. Properly designing indexes based on this information can improve query efficiency and reduce query costs. The following are some commonly used index solutions: 1. Clustered index A clustered index is an index that stores data in a table in a physical order . When creating a table, you can specify a primary key as a clustered index, and you can also add multiple clustered indexes. For businesses that are often queried according to the primary key, the clustered index is very effective, because the location of the data storage can be directly located when querying. 2. Unique index A unique index is an index that guarantees the uniqueness of a column value in a table. When designing the table structure, unique indexes can be created for columns that need to be unique. This avoids duplication of column values when inserting and updating data. Common unique indexes include primary key indexes, unique constraint indexes, etc. 3. Non-clustered index Non-clustered index is a common index type. Instead of storing the data in the table in physical order, it is stored separately, which contains a pointer to the actual data row. When querying a non-clustered index, you need to locate the index node first, and then find the real data according to the pointer. This index is suitable for frequently queried columns and can greatly improve query efficiency. 4. Composite index Composite index is an index composed of multiple columns. If you often need to query the combination of multiple columns in your business, you can use a composite index. The column order of the composite index is very important, and it needs to be designed according to the most commonly used query order. In general, larger tables should use composite indexes whenever possible. In short, the correct design of the index needs to consider many factors. Decision-making needs to be made in combination with specific business requirements, data structures, query modes, etc., in order to maximize the performance and response speed of the database.
