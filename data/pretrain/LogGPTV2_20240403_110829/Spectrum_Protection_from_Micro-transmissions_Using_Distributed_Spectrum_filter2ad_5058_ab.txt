### Embedded Computer Acting as a USB Host to the Sensor

An embedded computer functions as a USB host for the sensor. There are several such platforms available. The in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) components of a signal, often referred to as I and Q, respectively, contain information about both the amplitude and phase of the signal. The received IQ samples are used to reconstruct the received signal, which is then demodulated to extract the message signal.

### Experimental Setup and Performance Analysis

- **Detection Performance**: The detection performance significantly deteriorates as the transmission length decreases.

#### Experimentation Platforms
We conducted experiments using three different types of devices: Odroid-C2 [24], RaspberryPi-3 (RPi-3) [25], and RaspberryPi-1 (RPi-1) [25], along with a desktop for baseline comparison. These devices vary significantly in terms of cost and performance. CPU performance directly influences the transmitter detection performance due to the processing required for signal detection algorithms. Table 1 summarizes the capabilities of these devices.

#### Data Collection
- **Setup**: For all experiments, the transmitter and sensor were placed at a distance of five meters.
- **Transmitter**: A USRP-B210-based software radio that transmits an intermittent tone in the 915 MHz band with a default gain of 100.
- **Signal Detection Algorithm**: An energy-based signal detection algorithm was used, which calculates the total power within a frequency band by computing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the IQ samples. The signal is detected if the total power in the channel exceeds a predetermined threshold, determined by measuring the noise in the channel when no transmission is present.
- **Transmission Length**: All experiments used 1 ms transmission on the Odroid-C2 board with either USRP or RTL sensors. A single transmitter with a center frequency of 915 MHz and a default sampling rate of 1 Msps was considered.

### Motivation

As discussed in Section 2.1, these systems employ expensive compute operations on the received signals at the deployed spectrum sensor. For example, most prior work performs FFT on the received IQ samples at the sensor itself, computes the Power Spectral Density (PSD), and sends the results to a remote server for further analysis. This computation can slow down the sensor, leading to the dropping of IQ samples and making it difficult to detect micro-transmissions.

To quantify this, we conducted experiments to study the performance of detecting shorter intermittent transmissions by varying the transmission lengths from 1 µs to 1 s (see Figure 2). Even with identical parameters and configurations, there is a significant difference in detection performance based on the length of the transmitted signal. While the sensor can detect almost all 1 s transmissions, the detection performance for 1 µs falls to less than 30% and 10% on USRP and RTL-SDR sensors, respectively. This difference is likely due to the sensing parameters used on both the sensor and compute device (see Section 3), as we observe significantly better performance on high-end desktops with the same sensors (not shown here).

### Goals

Based on this initial study, our goals are:
1. To understand the factors that influence the performance of detecting micro-transmissions on inexpensive spectrum sensors.
2. To explore alternatives to improve the signal detection performance.

### Micro-benchmarking of Spectrum Sensors

Four different spectrum sensor parameters (Table 1) could influence the detection performance: sampling rate, integration size, FFT size, and compute device hardware. Additionally, placing the detection locally versus remotely, and the transmitter behavior, can also influence the detection performance. We study the impact of these properties.

#### Impact of Sampling Rate

- **General Trend**: Higher sampling rates generally improve transmission detection performance.
- **Challenges**:
  1. Not all sensors support multiple sampling rates. For example, USRP B210 supports sampling rates from 64 Ksps to 62 Msps, while RTL-SDR supports only from 1 Msps to 2.4 Msps.
  2. Higher sampling rates require proportionately higher backhaul network capacity.
  3. Increasing the sampling rate increases the noise floor, making it harder to detect micro-transmissions.
- **Experimental Results**:
  - **Figure 3**: Noise floor increases from -110 dB to -90 dB when the sampling rate increases from 1 Msps to 32 Msps on USRP. For RTL-SDR, the noise floor becomes greater than -70 dB due to its inaccurate analog converter [5].
  - **Figure 4**: Detection performance decreases by 30% and 80% from 1 Msps to 32 Msps sampling rate for local and remote processing, respectively. For RTL-SDR, detection ratio increases by 15% and 20% for local and remote detection, respectively, when the sampling rate increases from 1 Msps to 2 Msps.

#### Impact of Integration Size

- **Integration Size**: Critical for detecting micro-transmissions in terms of both FFT accuracy and compute requirement.
- **Experimental Results**:
  - **Figure 5**: Local detection performance drops by more than 30% from an integration size of 256 to 8192 on USRP. Decreasing the integration time from 256 to 128 also drops the detection rate by over 20%. Similar trends exist with RTL-SDR.

#### Impact of FFT Size

- **FFT Size**: Defines the number of bins while computing the FFT, representing the frequency resolution.
- **Experimental Results**:
  - **Figure 6**: Both RTL and USRP sensors perform better at 1024 FFT size. Having more than 1024 FFT size causes compute and buffer overflow, missing IQ samples. Having less than 1024 FFT size makes it hard to detect micro-transmissions.

### Device Performance

#### Direct Influence of Device Hardware

- **Experimental Setup**: Best performing sensor parameters (sampling rate of 1 Msps and integration size of 256) were used to evaluate detection ratio across different devices: Odroid-C2, RPi-3, RPi-1, and a desktop (See Table 1).
- **Experimental Results**:
  - **Figure 7**: Detection performance reduces with a reduction in the computation power of the computing device. Local detection ratio drops by over 50% and becomes the worst in case of RPi-1 (<20%). Remote processing has a much higher detection ratio than local processing, with up to 97% on Odroid-C2.
  - **Figure 8**: Detection ratio drops by almost 30% and 62% for local and remote processing on USRP, respectively, from 1536 MHz to 100 MHz clock frequency. Similar trends can be observed with RTL-SDR.

### Conclusion

The detection performance of micro-transmissions on inexpensive spectrum sensors is influenced by various factors, including sampling rate, integration size, FFT size, and compute device hardware. By understanding these factors, we can explore alternatives to improve the signal detection performance.
