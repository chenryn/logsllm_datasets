about the amplitude as well as the phase of the signal. The received IQ samples are
used to reconstruct the received signal which is later demodulated to extract the

platforms. We experiment with three diﬀerent types of devices—Odroid-C2 [24],
RaspberryPi-3 (RPi-3) [25] and RaspberryPi-1 (RPi-1) [25], along with a desktop
for a baseline comparison. Each of these devices vary signiﬁcantly in terms of
cost and performance. The CPU performance directly inﬂuences the transmitter
detection performance because of the processing needed for the signal detection
algorithms. Table 1 summarizes the capabilities of these devices.
Data Collection: For all the experiments, we place the transmitter and sensor
at a distance of ﬁve meters. This transmitter is a USRP-B210 based software
radio that transmits an intermittent tone in the 915 MHz band. The default
transmitter gain for all the experiments is 100. We use an energy-based signal
detection algorithm for detecting the transmitter [7]. The algorithm calculates
total power within a frequency band by computing FFT on the IQ samples. The
signal is detected if the total power in the channel is more than a predetermined
threshold. The threshold can be determined by measuring noise in the channel
when there is no transmission. For all the experiments, we use 1 ms transmission
on Odroid-C2 board with either USRP or RTL sensors. We consider a single
transmitter transmitting with a center frequency of 915 MHz. The default sam-
pling rate is 1 Msps.
2.3 Motivation
As explained in Sect. 2.1, these systems employ expensive compute operations
on the received signals at the deployed spectrum sensor. For example, most of
this prior work performs FFT on the received IQ samples at the sensor itself,
computes the PSD and sends the results to a remote server for further analysis.
This computation however can slow down the sensor, leading to dropping of IQ
samples and thereby making it hard to detect micro-transmissions. To quan-
tify this, we conduct experiments to study the performance of detecting shorter
intermittent transmissions by varying the Tx lengths from 1µs to 1 s (see Fig. 2).
Based on the length of transmitted signal, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence exists in
detection performance even if all other parameters and conﬁgurations are identi-

cal. While the sensor is able to detect almost all the 1 s transmissions, the detec-
tion performance for 1 µs falls to less than 30% and 10% on USRP and RTL-SDR
sensors respectively. This diﬀerence must stem from the sensing parameters used
on both the sensor and compute device (see Sect. 3) as we observe signiﬁcantly
better performance on high-end desktops with the same sensors (not shown
here). Note that the desktop machine has suﬃcient compute power, and we do
not expect any drop of samples on it.
Based on this initial study, our goal is to (i) understand the factors that
inﬂuence the performance of detecting micro-transmissions on the inexpensive
spectrum sensors and (ii) explore an alternative to improve the signal detection
performance.
3 Micro-benchmarking of Spectrum Sensors
Four diﬀerent spectrum sensor parameters (Table 1) could inﬂuence the detec-
tion performance—sampling rate, integration size, FFT size, and compute device
hardware. Sampling rate here is the number of IQ samples received per sec-
ond. Integration size is the number of samples (i.e., the length of the signal in
time) used in a single FFT computation. FFT size is the number of FFT bins.
Apart from these parameters, placing the detection locally versus remote, and
the transmitter behavior can also inﬂuence the detection performance. We study
the impact of these properties.
3.1 Sensor Performance
Impact of Sampling Rate: In general, more the sampling rate, better the
transmission detection performance. However, distributed spectrum patrolling
with inexpensive sensors brings many challenges in using higher sampling rates:
(1) Not all sensors support multiple sampling rates. For example, USRP B210
supports sampling rates from 64 Ksps to 62 Msps while RTL supports only
from 1 Msps to 2.4 Msps. (2) Higher sampling rates also require proportionately
higher backhaul network capacity. (3) Finally, there is a general concern where

increasing the sampling rate increases the noise ﬂoor which makes it harder to
detect micro-transmissions. We study this impact of sampling rate on the inex-
pensive spectrum sensors.
Figure 3 shows that the noise-ﬂoor increases from −110 dB to −90 dB when
the sampling rate increases from 1 Msps to 32 Msps on USRP. This becomes
much worse, greater than −70 dB, for RTL-SDR because of its inaccurate analog
converter [5]. This increase in noise-ﬂoor makes it hard to choose a threshold
for the transmission detection, especially given the fact that there can be many
heterogeneous sensors deployed with diﬀerent sampling rates.
Figure 4 shows the impact of sampling rate on detection performance. The
detection performance using local and remote processing decreases by 30% and
80% respectively from 1 Msps to 32 Msps sampling rate. This is a counterintuitive
result because we expect to see an increase in detection ratio with the increase in
sampling rate. This is because the sensor is unable to cope with the speed at which
the samples are received under higher sampling rates (remote), and FFT and PSD
computation (local). Hence, the sensor is losing many of the important samples
that could otherwise detect transmissions. The result is diﬀerent with RTL-SDR
against sampling rate. When sampling rate increases from 1 Msps to 2 Msps, the
detection ratio increases by 15% and 20% for local and remote detection respec-
tively. We explain this by noting that the bits per sample of RTL-SDR is less than
USRP, and hence RTL-SDR data require less. Also, reducing the sampling rate
below 1 Msps decreases detection ratio due to insuﬃcient number of samples.

Impact of Integration Size: Integration size is a critical parameter in detect-
ing micro-transmissions in terms of both FFT accuracy and compute require-
ment. Increasing the integration size increases the accuracy of FFT computa-
tions, but also increases the amount of computation power needed to compute
it. We study the impact of integration size while computing the PSD locally on
both USRP and RTL-SDR sensors.
Figure 5 shows local detection performance against integration size on USRP
and RTL-SDR on an Odroid-C2. We set the FFT size at 1024 for this experiment,
as we ﬁnd in the next experiment that it provides the best detection performance.
The detection drops by more than 30% from an integration size of 256 to 8192 on
USRP. The reason behind this impact is that more number of samples the FFT is
computed on, harder it is to detect micro-transmissions as the power is averaged
over many noise samples. Another interesting result is that if we decrease the
integration time from 256 to 128, the detection rate also drops by over 20%. This
discrepancy is because the increased number of FFTs become computationally
intensive, and consequently, it is not able to handle all the incoming IQ samples.
Similar trend exists with RTL-SDR. Therefore, we observe that the integration
size should neither be too low nor be too high.
Impact of FFT Size: FFT size deﬁnes the number of bins while computing the
FFT. Each bin represents the resolution of frequency. For example, if sampling
rate is 1 Msps and FFT size is 1024, then the frequency resolution should be
1 MHz/1024 which is 1024 Hz. Smaller the frequency resolution (i.e., more bins),
more accurately we can detect the power at a given frequency. Also, it increases
the amount of computation needed. We evaluate detection ratio with diﬀerent
FFT sizes from 128 to 8192 with local processing on an Odroid-C2. We use an
integration size of 256 samples, as we have observed in the previous experiment
that it provides the best detection performance.
Figure 6 shows the impact of FFT size on detection performance. Both RTL
and USRP sensors perform better at 1024 FFT size. Having more than 1024 FFT
size causes compute and buﬀer overﬂow thereby missing IQ samples. Whereas
having less than 1024 FFT size makes it hard to detect micro-transmissions.
This is because the signal power gets averaged with noise ﬂoor due to larger bin
size. On the other hand, we ﬁnd that the optimal FFT size on desktop to detect
micro-transmissions is 8192.

3.2 Device Performance
In the previous section, we studied impact of low-end hardware on the sensor
parameters that aﬀect detection performance. In this section, we study the direct
inﬂuence of device hardware on detection. We keep the best performing sensor
parameters such as sampling rate (1 Msps) and integration size (256) and eval-
uate the detection ratio across diﬀerent devices – Odroid-C2, RPi-3, RPi-1, and
a desktop (See Table 1).
Detection Performance Across Devices: Figure 7 shows the performance of
detection for both local and remote processing. We observe that in each case,
performance of detection reduces with a reduction in the computation power of
the computing device. For both USRP and RTL sensors, as we go from more
powerful to less powerful computing devices, the local detection ratio drops by
over 50% and becomes the worst in case of RPi-1 (<20%). This must be due to
the compute capacity of the device as the other parameters are unchanged.
We also ﬁnd that remote processing has much higher detection ratio than
local processing when other sensor and transmitter-related parameters are iden-
tical. The compute capacity is a bottleneck for local detection because of the
FFT and PSD computation, as we observe that remote detection is as high as
97% on Odroid-C2. Even the remote detection performance degrades to only
60% of total transmissions on RPi-1 as its poor hardware is not able to cope
with the sampling rate at which the sensors are sampling.
Critical Device Bottleneck: To further understand the impact of the device,
we experiment with the most critical parameter of the device – CPU clock fre-
quency (as we have seen relatively less impact with other device parameters
such as memory and number of cores). A reduction in CPU clock frequency
leads to slower computation on the board, and thus lower detection ratio. This
is especially important because many such single board compute devices have
varied clock frequencies. We conduct the same study for six diﬀerent clock fre-
quencies available on the Odroid-C2 board. Figure 8 shows the detection ratio
against clock frequency. From 1536 MHz to 100 MHz clock frequency, the detec-
tion ratio for local and remote processing on USRP drops by almost 30% and

62% respectively. Similar trends can also be observed with RTL-SDR. An inter-
esting observation is that the decrease in detection ratio in case of RTL-SDR
is less than USRP despite being much cheaper. This is because RTL-SDR has
