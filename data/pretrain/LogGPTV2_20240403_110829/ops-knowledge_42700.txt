User: When I run pip install or only pip from Windows Command Line, I think that it causes deadlock and it's impossible to exit running process by pressing CTRL + C
When I run it from Git Bash, it gives me errors
0 [sig] bash 9796 get_proc_lock: Couldn't acquire sync_proc_subproc for(5,1), last 7, Win32 error 0

Assistant: I just fixed it. Solution is to call pip as a python module. 

Remove pip.exe, pip3.exe, pip3.5.exe from PYTHON_PATH/Scripts
Create file pip.bat inside folder described above
Open pip.bat in text editor and copy lines below to it

@echo off 
call "python" -m pip %*
