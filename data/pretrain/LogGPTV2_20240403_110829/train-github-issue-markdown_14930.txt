### Describe the workflow you want to enable
Like in R, can we add an option of offset in sklearn so that we can fix the
value of some coefficients for logistic regression?
For those who don't know offset, offset is defined as a fixed feature with
coefficient being 1. Therefore, if $y=g(x\beta + z\alpha)$ and we want to
choose some pre-determined value $\alpha_0$, we can just pass $z\alpha_0$ to
offset.
### Describe your proposed solution
I feel this might be straightforward but, as someone who doesn't know the
original code/module that well, it would be great if someone can give any
advice on if this is feasible. Also any suggestions on its functionality would
be helpful.
