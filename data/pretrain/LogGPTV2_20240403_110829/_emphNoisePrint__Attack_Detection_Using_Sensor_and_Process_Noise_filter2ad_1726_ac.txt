designed the estimator so that it predicts the states of the two-tanks
simultaneously. The Kalman filter can be expressed as follows,
ˆxk +1 = F ˆxk + Guk + L(¯yk − ˆxk),
(10)
where ˆxk is the estimate of the system state and ¯yk is the last (pos-
sibly attacked) sensor measurement. L is the Kalman gain matrix
which is a weighting factor for the computation of the Kalman esti-
mate. The value of the Kalman gain could be between 0 and 1 [10]
which makes the estimation to either give more weight to current
measurement of the sensor or to the previous estimate of the sate.
Since we have a combined system model, a combined estimator is
derived which is a matrix of a 2 × 2 such that,

4.2 WADI System Model
Figure 8 in appendix E shows a system level abstraction of the
water distribution testbed [6]. It has three major stages: Primary
Grid, Secondary Grid and Return Water. Each stage consists of
set of sensors and actuators. We consider sensor measurements as
outputs and actuation control actions as inputs. There are multitude
of sensors, actuating devices and six consumers nodes in WADI,
which makes it a complex system to obtain a system model from
first principles. To derive a system model, the plant is run for 14
days and data is collected for inputs and outputs. Using sub-space
system identification [40] techniques, a model of the following form
is obtained.
yk = Cxk + ηk
xk +1 = Axk + Buk + vk
(12)
(13)
where k ∈ N is the discrete time index, xk ∈ Rn is the state of
the approximated model, (its dimension depends on the order of
the approximated model), y ∈ Rm are the measured outputs, and
u ∈ Rp denotes the actuator action which depends on the demand
patterns. The system identification problem is to determine the sys-
tem matrices A, B, C from input-output data. The obtained model
provides a good fit (as shown in next section) between measure-
ments and modeled outputs (generated using the identified system
model) with 10 states, i.e., n = 10. We also identified a few higher
and lower order models. Ultimately, the model with 10 states has a
nice trade-off between prediction error and the dimensions of the
model.
4.3 System Model Validation
The identified model is validated by looking at the system state
evolution based on the identified state space matrices and initial
state x1. The closeness of the system evolution to the sensor mea-
surements obtained from real testbed indicates that this model is a
faithful representation of the water distribution network, as shown
in Figure 5. The top pane shows the sensor readings from real-
testbed as well as the modeled output for the electromagnetic flow
meter using system matrices. We can observe that modeled output
is very close to sensor readings, resulting in small error. (Error is
shown in the middle pane, while error’s probability distribution
is shown in the bottom pane.) In Figure 11 shown in appendix D,
we can see that real sensor measurement and sensor estimate for
Tank-1 in SWaT is the same, thus validating the model and ensuring
that it is representative of the real testbed. The middle pane shows
the difference between real sensor measurement and the sensor
estimate. The bottom pane shows the plot of PDF for the residual
vector, and for the level sensor in the SWaT testbed.
Besides visual representation of the model, we also analyzed
the statistical metric for the obtained model. Variance Account For
(VAF) values [54] are used on a data set from the real testbeds. VAF
is defined as,
V AF = max{1 − (var(yk − ˆyk))/var(yk), 0} ∗ 100,
(14)
where ˆyk denotes the estimated output signal, yk sensor measure-
ments, and var the variance of a signal. The VAF values are shown
in appendix D Table 6 for SWaT testbed and in Table 2 for WADI
testbed. We can see that for SWaT both level sensor’s VAF values
are 100%, because (y − ˆy) value is very small, i.e. for level sensor on

5 PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
In this section a brief background on statistical detectors is given,
followed by attack design against such detectors and evaluation of
the proposed scheme.
5.1 Statistical Detectors: A Primer
Residuals and Hypothesis Testing: For the case of statistical de-
tectors, estimated state values are compared with sensor measure-
ments ¯yk (which may have been attacked). The difference between
the two should stay within a certain threshold under normal oper-
ation, otherwise an alarm is triggered to point a potential attack.
Define the residual random sequence rk , k ∈ N as,
rk := ¯yk − C ˆxk = Cek + ηk + δk .
If there are no attacks, the mean of the residual is,
E[rk +1] = CE[ek +1] + E[ηk +1] = 0m×1.
(15)
(16)
where 0m×1 denotes an m × 1 matrix composed of only zeros, and
the covariance is given by,
Σ := E[rk +1rT
k +1] = CPCT + R2.
(17)
For this residual, we identify two hypotheses to be tested, H0 the
normal mode (no attacks) and H1 the faulty mode (with attacks).
We can formulate the hypothesis testing in a more formal manner
using existing change detection techniques (as explained in the
following) based on the statistics of the residuals.
Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) Detector: The CUSUM procedure is
driven by the residual sequences. In particular, the input to the
CUSUM procedure is a distance measure, i.e., a measure of how
deviated the estimator is from the actual system, and this measure
is a function of the residuals. We propose the absolute value of the
entries of the residual sequence as distance measure, i.e.,
zk,i := |rk,i| = |Ciek + ηk,i + δk,i|.
(18)
For a given distance measure zk,i ∈ R, the CUSUM of Page [41] is
written as follows.
CUSUM: S0,i = 0,
(cid:26) Sk,i = max(0, Sk−1,i + zk,i − bi),
i ∈ I,
Sk,i = 0 and ˜ki = k − 1,
if Sk−1,i ≤ τi ,
if Sk−1,i > τi .
Design parameters: bias bi > 0 and threshold τi > 0.
Output: alarm time(s) ˜ki.
(19)
Bad-Data Detector: For the residual sequence rk,i given by (15),
the Bad-Data detector is defined as follows.
Bad-Data Procedure:
i ∈ I.
If |rk,i| > αi ,
˜ki = k,
Design parameter: threshold αi > 0.
Output: alarm time(s) ˜ki.
Using the Bad-Data detector an alarm is triggered if distance mea-
sure |rk,i| exceeds the threshold αi. In Appendix B, more details on
these statistical detectors are given for an interested reader.
(20)
5.2 Zero-Alarm Attack Design
We executed the two types of zero-alarm attacks on SWaT testbed
against the introduced statistical detectors.
Zero-Alarm Attack for Bad-Data Detector: This attack is de-
signed to stay undetected by the Bad-Data detectors. The attacker
knows the system dynamics, has access to sensor readings, and
knows the detector parameters, it is able to inject false data into real-
time measurements and stay undetected. Consider the Bad-Data
procedure and write (20) in terms of the estimated state ˆxk,
|rk,i| = |yk,i − Ci ˆxk + δk,i| ≤ αi ,
(21)
By assumption, the attacker has access to yk,i = Ci xk + ηk,i. More-
over, given its perfect knowledge of the observer, the opponent can
i ∈ I.

It follows that,
δk,i = Ci ˆxk − yk,i + αi − ϵi , (αi > ϵi) → |rk,i| = αi − ϵi ,
i ∈ I,

The constant ϵi > 0 is a small positive constant introduced to ac-
count for numerical precision. These attacks maximize the damage
