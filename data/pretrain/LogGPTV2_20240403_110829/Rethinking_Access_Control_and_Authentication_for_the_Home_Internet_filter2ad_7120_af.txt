and who made them.
• Mower On/Off: Turn the lawn mower on or off remotely (i. e.,
on a smartphone, from anywhere).

entered the home at what times. People will be identiﬁed based
on whose PIN code or smartphone was used to unlock the door.
• Lock State: See whether the front door is currently locked or
unlocked.

locked or unlocked, connecting it to other devices, sensors, and
services. For example, one could create a rule specifying that the
lock should always be locked when no one is home.
• Answer Door: Answer the doorbell by seeing a live video of
who is at the front door and having the opportunity to unlock the
door remotely (e. g., on a smartphone, from anywhere).

on, as well as how bright it is (e. g., on a smartphone, from any-
where).
• Lights Rule: Create rules that specify when the lights should
turn on/off or change color based on other sensors, devices, and
services. For example, one could create rules specifying how
the lights automatically change brightness or color based on the

turning its lens to view a different angle, zooming in/out, etc.).
C Full Descriptions of Relationships
• Your spouse: Imagine you have a spouse. You live with them
everyday and share all smart appliances in your home. You make
decisions together in most cases, especially important ones.
• Your teenage child: Imagine you have a 16-year-old child. They
live with you, go to school in the morning, and come back in the
afternoon (on the weekdays). They are familiar with all of these
Smart devices in your home, and enjoy using them. They know
how to use these devices as well as you do, if not better. They
spend a lot of time on their smartphone. They usually are well-
behaved, but they are still a teenager.
• Your child in elementary school: Imagine you have an 8-year-
old child who is still in elementary school. They live with you
and go to school daily, unless it’s the weekend or a holiday. They
have a basic idea of how to use smart devices. However, they
don’t know how to use some more complex features properly,
like changing the settings, but it doesn’t discourage them from
trying. They do not have their own smartphone, but they keep
asking you for one.
• A visiting family member: Imagine you have a visiting family
member. They are about the same age as you, if not much older.
You grew up together, but now you meet each other once or twice
a year, because you live far away from each other. They visit you
on holidays or other big events. They usually stay with you for
several days, maybe even a little bit past the holiday, and they
remain at home alone while you are away for work.
• The babysitter: Imagine you have a babysitter in your home
for taking care of your child. They will be at your place while
you are at work. They work 4 hours after school, 3 days per
week. You have known them over 6 months and you are satisﬁed
with their work so far, and have no intention of letting them go
anytime soon.
• Your neighbor: Imagine you have a neighbor living next to you.
You dont know them very well, but they seem to be good people.
If you meet them on the street, you greet them and make some
friendly small talk. Occasionally you invite them over for dinner,
but they are never in your house when you are away.

D Survey Instrument
Introduction Computing is transitioning from single-user devices,
such as laptops and phones, to the Internet of Things, in which many
users will interact with a particular device, such as an Amazon Echo
or Internet-connected door lock. Current measures fail to provide
usable authentication, access control, or privacy when multiple users
share a device. Even more so, the users of a given device often have
complex social relationships to each other. Our goal is to develop
techniques and interfaces that enable accurate access control and au-
thentication in multi-user IoT environments, based on user preferences.
Participation should take about 20 minutes.
In recent years, many internet-connected (”smart”) home devices and
appliances have entered the market. Imagine that you own many such
smart devices that are connected both to the Internet and to each other.
This includes a smart hub that can control other devices in your home,
particularly with the help of the smart voice assistant. You also have
a smart door lock and smart camera for home security, as well as
smart lighting and a smart thermostat to control your environment.
There is also a smart lawn mower maintaining your lawn. All of these
devices can be remotely controlled using a smartphone app by anyone
to whom you have given permission. You, or anyone else you have
permitted, can also write rules specifying in what situations devices
should activate automatically.
In this survey, we will ask you questions about who in your household
should be allowed to access one particular feature of a smart device.
If you live in multiple places, think of the home in which you live
the majority of the time. For all questions, assume that the system
has correctly identiﬁed the user involved (i. e., there are no cases of
mistaken identity).
Because the situations may involve either positive or negative conse-
quences, you should take some time to think about your response. The
next button will not appear until you have spent at least 30 seconds on
each page.
In this survey, we will ask whether you will allow people of the
following relationships to control a particular feature of a smart device:
your spouse; your teenage child; your child in elementary school; a
visiting family member; a babysitter; your neighbor. Please imagine
you have these relationships in your life even if you don’t. All of these
relationships are separate people.
If you grant access to any of these people,
they will be able to
access your devices whether or not they are in your home, unless
you specify otherwise in your responses in the survey. All ques-
tions in this survey will focus on one particular feature, but we will
ask about your opinion on how different people should be able to use it.
The following use the example “Your Spouse”, a “Smart Hub”,
and a hub-related capability.
The questions on this page only focus on the following person: Your
spouse: Imagine you have a spouse. You live with them everyday and
share all smart appliances in your home. You make decisions together
in most cases, especially important ones.
Imagine you are the owner of a Smart Hub.
Should your spouse be able to use the following feature? [capability]
(cid:13) Always (24/7/365) (cid:13) Never (cid:13) Sometimes, depending on speciﬁc
factors

this feature. How much of an inconvenience, if any, would this be? (cid:13)
Not an inconvenience (cid:13) Minor inconvenience (cid:13) Major inconvenience
Why? Please be speciﬁc.
Show questions if ”Never” chosen
Why?
Imagine that the device incorrectly allows your spouse the ability to
use this feature. How much of an inconvenience, if any, would this be?
(cid:13) Not an inconvenience (cid:13) Minor inconvenience (cid:13) Major inconve-
nience
Why? Please be speciﬁc.
Show questions if ”Sometimes” chosen
When should they be allowed to use this feature? Please be speciﬁc.
How important is it that they be allowed to use the feature in the
cases you speciﬁed above? (cid:13) Not important (cid:13) Slightly important (cid:13)
Moderately important (cid:13) Very important (cid:13) Extremely important
In contrast, when should they not be allowed to use this feature? Please
be speciﬁc.
How important is it that they not be allowed to use the feature in the
cases you speciﬁed above?
(cid:13) Not important (cid:13) Slightly important (cid:13) Moderately important (cid:13)
Very important (cid:13) Extremely important
Thanks! We will now be asking you an additional set of questions.
Imagine that you have already chosen settings specifying who can and
cannot access a certain feature in your home. Think broadly about all
types of people you might want to allow to control these devices; do
not restrict yourself just to the relationships we have previously asked
about.
Imagine you are still the owner of a Smart Hub. You
