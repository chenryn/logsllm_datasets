Hi, I have a problem with Python and some libraries. Install python from the
official website, simply download and install it directly with version 3.7 on
my Macbook Pro macOS Catalina version 10.15.4 where through Thonny, I
installed the numpy, pandas, matlob and other libraries, I don't have any
other python ; but it doesn't work for me and it marks this error.  
I tried all the solutions but still not working.
### Reproducing code example:
import numpy as np  
A=[4,7,8,9,10,4]  
B=[3,5,7,8,9,3]  
U=[-2,-3,4,5,6,-7,-8,9,10,0]  
print(np.add(A,B))  
print("Positive",np.positive(U))  
print(np.negative(U))  
print(np.multiply(A,B))  
print(np.multiply(A,3))  
print(np.power(B,2))  
print(np.subtract(B,A))  
print(np.floor_divide(B,2))  
print(np.divide(B,10))
### Error message:
ImportError: IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS
ISSUE! Importing the numpy c-extensions failed. - Try uninstalling and
reinstalling numpy. - If you have already done that, then: 1. Check that you
expected to use Python3.7 from
"/Applications/Thonny.app/Contents/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3.7",
and that you have no directories in your PATH or PYTHONPATH that can interfere
with the Python and numpy version "1.18.2" you're trying to use. 2. If (1)
looks fine, you can open a new issue at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues.
Please include details on: - how you installed Python - how you installed
numpy - your operating system - whether or not you have multiple versions of
Python installed - if you built from source, your compiler versions and
ideally a build log - If you're working with a numpy git repository, try `git
clean -xdf` (removes all files not under version control) and rebuild numpy.
Note: this error has many possible causes, so please don't comment on an
existing issue about this - open a new one instead. Original error was:

packages/numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.cpython-37m-darwin.so, 2): no suitable
