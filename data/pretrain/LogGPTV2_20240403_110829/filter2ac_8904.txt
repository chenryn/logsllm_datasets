titleblackhat:us-22 From Hackathon to Hacked: Web3's Security Journey
If there's one prediction you can make with certainty, it's that security in the Web3/blockchain space will get a whole lot worse before it gets better. We have the perfect cocktail of inexperience mixed with emerging technology playing out in full public view with large sums at stake and the permanence of immutable transactions. The result is predictable. An environment free from constraints can seem like an innovation paradise, but when the stakes are so high, you have to get everything right the first time because there may not be a next time. We tend to forget that what we see from this space are experiments playing out in production, and the time between exploitation and losing millions of dollars worth of value can be measured in seconds. So, how did we get here? Is it all doom and gloom? What can be done?This talk is a grounded look at the factors contributing to the security failures we've witnessed, free from the hype and hatred associated with the space. We look at the similarities and differences between the development of this new technology and more traditional applications and how some of the attacks manifested. Better testing and tools aren't enough to solve the problem. We discuss actionable steps projects and chains can use today to address these issues and make the ecosystem safer for projects and users.
