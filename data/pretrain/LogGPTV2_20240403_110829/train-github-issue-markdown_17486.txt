### What problem does this feature solve?
Currently, you can set a `true` value on a prop by simply using the prop's
name (i.e. ``), but there is no equivalence for setting
`false` values (i.e. ``).
In most cases (like above), `false` is already the default value, but there
are still many instances where a prop's default is `true` and must be
overridden. The API is cumbersome in those instances.
### What does the proposed API look like?
I'm proposing a simple, in-template, "false-assertion" shorthand that could
significantly improve the Vue developer experience. The "false-assertion"
operator would explicitly set props to `false`.
