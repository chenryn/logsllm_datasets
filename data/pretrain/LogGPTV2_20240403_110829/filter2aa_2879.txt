Confidence Game Theater References
Puzzlers' Tribute edited by David Wolfe and Tom Rodgers (2002) containes a chapter by William 
Kalush called Sleight of Hand with Playing Cards prior to Scot's Discoverie. This chapter includes a 
description of the earliest known deception with playing cards, which is a relative of Three Card Monte.
Rogues, Vagabonds & Sturdy Beggars edited by Arthur F. Kinney (1973) contains reprints of some 
sixteenth and seventeenth century pamphlets discussing crime and criminals. It includes A Notable 
Discovery of Cozenage by Robert Greene (1591), which describes Mumchance, and The Fraternity of 
Vagabonds by John Awdeley (1561), which describes an early version of The Lost Ring, similar to the 
Apple1 skit we performed.
Gambling Scams by Darwin Ortiz (1984) has a chapter about Three Card Monte and a chapter devoted 
to Confidence Games, both of them very good.
