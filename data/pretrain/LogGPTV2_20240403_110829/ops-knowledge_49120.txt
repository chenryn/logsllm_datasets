User: How to ensure the high availability of virtual machine operation?
Assistant: To ensure high availability of virtual machines, the following aspects need to be considered: 1. Load balancing: By using load balancing technology, virtual machines are allocated to different physical hosts, so as to avoid resource bottlenecks and single point of failure. 2. High-availability storage: Use high-availability storage technology, such as RAID or storage area network (SAN), to achieve data persistence and data reliability through redundant data and backup, thereby preventing data loss or unavailability of virtual machines. 3. Automatic failover: By setting automatic failover (Automatic Failover) to ensure high availability of virtual machine operation. When a physical host fails or fails, the virtual machine will automatically switch to other available hosts. 4. Hardware redundancy: Use hardware redundancy technology, such as multiple power supplies or fans, and install the same hardware device on different hosts to prevent hardware failures from affecting virtual machines. 5. Real-time monitoring: monitor the operation of virtual machines in real time, and set alarm thresholds, send alarms when abnormalities occur, and deal with faults in time to ensure continuous availability of virtual machines.
