Working Principles
The First on-Line conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'05) is an on-line conference aimed at a
different type of interaction than that provided by conventional conferences.
The papers submitted to the conference will undergo the standard blind peer-review procedure, and after that, accepted
papers will be included in on-line proceedings. On-line proceedings will be available prior to the conference to maximize
opportunities for discussion.
Authors of accepted papers will have the responsibility to present their papers and answer questions in virtual sessions,
with asynchronous communication, during the days of the conference. The discussions will be recorded and used as a
source for improving the papers presented, which will later be published in post-proceedings after the conference.

Call For Papers
The Semantic Web (SW) poses new challenges to Information Systems. A first observation concerning the
current situation is that the field of SW is dominated by rather technical approaches exhibiting a lack of
multidisciplinary contributions and insights. From this perspective this track attempts to fill this gap, with a
special emphasis on demystifying the Semantic Web and revealing novel opportunities for value exploitation.
With the common practice of considering the Semantic Web as a technology-driven phenomenon, we will
contribute to a scientific debate, which reveals the practical implications and the research challenges of SW in
the context of Information Systems. Our approach should go beyond the traditional research agenda of
Information Systems and critical themes will be analyzed through a Semantic Web perspective in horizontal
and vertical pillars. The main objective is to communicate high quality research findings in the leading-edge
aspects of Semantic Web and Information Systems convergence. This statement distinguishes this track from
traditional SW tracks: Traditionally, the Semantic Web is treated as a technological phenomenon with the
main emphasis on technologies, languages and tools without similar attention given to theoretical
constructions or linkages to multidisciplinary references: Our focus is on the Information Systems Discipline
and we are working towards the delivery of the main implications that the Semantic Web brings to
Information Systems and the Information/Knowledge Society.
Suggested topics:
- Semantic Web Issues, Challenges and Implications in each of the IS research streams
- Towards the development of the Knowledge society
- New Semantic Web enabled Tools for the citizen/ learner/ organization/ business
- New Semantic Web enabled Business Models
- New Semantic Web enabled Information systems and knowledge repositories
- Integration with other disciplines
- Intelligent Systems
- Standards
- Semantic enabled business intelligence
- Enterprise Application Integration
- Metadata-driven (bottom-up) versus ontology-driven (top-down) SW development
BEST PAPER will be invited for publication in AIS SIGSEMIS official peer reviewed journal: International
Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems.

Call for Papers for the Mini Track
Semantic e-Business
Sponsored by AIS SIGSEMIS
Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS)
August 11th-15th, 2005, Omaha, NE, USA
The emergence of collaborative processes as an effective means for organizations to deliver their value
propositions to their customers, and ultimately to consumers, places an increased onus on organizations to
develop systems incorporating emergent technologies. These systems should support the seamless availability
of information and knowledge, content and know-how, among partners in the organizations’ value chains.
Rapidly increasing volume of available information and growing competition in the digital economy are
forcing organizations to find efficient ways to gain valuable information and knowledge to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of their business processes.
The realization of representing these knowledge-rich processes is possible through the broad developments in
the ‘Semantic Web’ initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium. But significant amount of research is
needed to understand how conceptualizations that comprise business processes can be captured, represented,
shared and processed by both human and intelligent agent-based information systems to create transparency
in service and supply chains. The developments in on-demand content and business logic availability through
technologies such as web-services offer the potential to allow organizations to create content-based and logic
or intelligence driven information value chains enabling the needed information transparencies for semantic e-
business processes.
Developments on these dimensions are critical to the design of knowledge-based and intelligence driven
processes in the digital economy. Research is needed in the development of business models that can take
advantage of emergent technologies to support collaborative, knowledge-rich processes in the digital
economy. Equally important is the adaptation and assimilation of emergent technologies to enable business
processes that contribute to organizations’ value propositions. This mini track invites original research
contributions that investigate the development of innovative business models to support knowledge-rich
business models that enhance collaborations in the digital economy.
Possible topics for papers (theoretical or empirical) submitted to the special issue include but are not limited
to:
¨ models explicating the various forms of knowledge-based processes in the digital economy and their value
to the competitiveness of organizations
¨ the realization of the potential of emergent technologies in supporting knowledge-rich processes required
for semantic e-business.
¨ initiatives for knowledge representation using ontologies and intelligent Agents for semantic processing of
cross-enterprise business processes over heterogeneous systems.
¨ collaborative relationships in the digital economy, enabled and supported by emergent technologies
¨ the facilitation, initiation, nurturing, development and maintenance of various forms of knowledge-based
exchange relationships in the digital environment
¨ competitive advantage afforded by knowledge-rich processes in semantic e-business
¨ agents and collaborative systems for intelligent knowledge sharing
¨ web enabled knowledge transfer and sharing

Description
===========
Modeling corporate knowledge is one of the most attractive themes in applied research and it has been an
important motivation for several areas of investigations like distribute systems and knowledge management.
Clearly, the business world considers this issue of strategic relevance and keeps paying particular attention to
it because many theoretical results have already been proved
effectiveness in real applications like data warehouse construction, information infrastructure definition, and
all processes and applications of knowledge management.
These knowledge models in industry aim at providing a framework for information and knowledge sharing,
reliable information exchange, meaning negotiation and coordination between distinct organizations or
among members of the same one.
With the application of new methodologies and techniques in the everyday practice and the accessibility of
new theoretical results in this area, developing new tools based on more sophisticated frameworks has
become a common need. This is an important reason for
the increasing interest in the employment of formal ontologies in fields like medicine, engineering, financial
and legal systems, and other business practices.
Objectives
==========
The workshop is a forum to meet and discuss problems, solutions, perspectives and research directions for
researchers and practitioners. We welcome papers or project descriptions that aim at
applying formal ontologies in industry. In particular,
- theoretical studies on formal ontologies committed to provide sound bases for industrial applications and
to allow formal representation of corporate knowledge;
- business experiences on case studies that single out concrete problems and possible solutions; the
