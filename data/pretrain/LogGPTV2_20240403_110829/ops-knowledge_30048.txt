User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Ubuntu server PPTPD with OS X clients Problems I'm trying to get a PPTP server running on a ubuntu server, but I've run into some issues with it. I followed this guide on how to set up pptpd on my server, and everything went smooth, but when I try to connect with my mac, it gives me this error:

VPN Error http://grab.by/31X

Here's my configuration:

http://grab.by/31Y

Does anyone have any idea as to what I'm doing wrong here?

Update: Here's what the pptpd.log has to say about it:

My pptpd options are:


asyncmap 0
noauth
crtscts
lock
hide-password
modem
debug
proxyarp
lcp-echo-interval 30
lcp-echo-failure 4
nopix

Assistant: OSX had bad implementation of PPTP - try using a windows client, or run virtualbox and run windows to test the VPN. This cost me two weeks of summer till i found out!
