It doesn't matter what logic a class loader uses: it may load classes that
follow a given naming convention or find them using name-path pairs. But it
always does the same thing: loading classes. So, wouldn't it be better to have
an `AbstractClassLoader` that all the loaders will have to extend? It will
provide the final `register()` and `unregister()` methods, an abstract
`findClass()` method and a default implementation of `loadClass()`.
I can take the work if you think it's a good idea.
