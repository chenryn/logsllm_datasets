sion rate adaptively to the varying channel conditions according to the adaptive
ARF. This type of combined rate control is eﬀective in improving the link quality
under dynamically interfered varying channel conditions.
Evaluation Results. We developed
an emulation environment in order
to evaluate the eﬃciency of the pro-
posed attack strategy and conven-
tional attack strategies in a dense
network. The jammer can transmit
packets using random jamming, re-
active jamming, and persistent jam-
ming strategies. In the emulation
model, there are multiple BSSs with
8 access points. Each AP uses 8 dif-
ferent channels in the 5 GHz ISM
band. There is one target node, one
malicious node, and other legitimate
nodes in multiple BSSs. There are up
to eight legitimate nodes in the net-
work. The access point transmits 2,000 packets with a 1,000 byte length to the
target node. The target node experiences varying channels in terms of SNR and
interference levels.
Fig. 8. Jamming eﬃcacy: throughput vs.
number of BSSs
Figure 8 presents the degraded throughput for the jamming schemes versus the
number of BSSs. Increasing the number of BSSs causes more co-channel and ad-
jacent channel interference in the target device when the jammer is transmitted
at a small transmission power (0 dBm). As a result, if there is no malicious jam-
mer, the target node is only aﬀected by interference from other legitimate nodes in
378

multiple BSSs. The random jammer has the worst performance. It is interesting
that the reactive jammer is only eﬀective if there are no other nodes, except the
target node. However, the persistent jammer signiﬁcantly degrades the through-
put performance of a target node in dense network conditions. If the jammer trans-
mits 15 dB higher jamming power, which is equivalent to 15 dBm transmission
power at the output port of the RF ampliﬁer, the measured throughput was close
to zero for persistent jamming. This indicates that the eﬀective throughput can
be made zero through corrupting every packet being transmitted. In contrast,
other jamming schemes were not signiﬁcantly improved compared with the “w/o
jammer” case. The evaluation results demonstrate that persistent jamming can
improve the attack eﬃciency by approximately 80% in dense networks compared
with reactive jamming schemes, and it can disconnect the link of the target node
with a 20 dBm jamming power and 125 ms response time.
5 Defenses
In this section, we recommend four security defenses against the proposed per-
sistent jamming attacks. In order to protect the ID information in the PHY
header, we propose including a non-cryptographic device authentication and
dynamic ID allocation mechanism during the standardization process for the
next generation of WLANs. In addition, as potential countermeasures against
the device ﬁngerprint tracking, we recommend digital predistortion and friendly
jamming techniques from an implementation perspective.
5.1 ID Protection
Non-cryptographic Device Authentication. In the current WLAN stan-
dards, the signal information in the physical layer header is not protected; thus,
the ID in the signal ﬁeld can be tracked by attackers. A complete solution would
be to use a cryptographic mechanism that uses a shared key in the MAC layer in
order to achieve authenticity, integrity, and conﬁdentiality. However, the conven-
tional cryptographic mechanisms require key management to distribute, refresh,
and revoke the keys. Due to the ineﬃciency in terms of complexity and overhead,
a non-cryptographic scheme in the PHY layer is required for device identiﬁca-
tion. For example, in a typical indoor wireless channel, the channel response
decorrelates rapidly in space [27]. In addition, the channel reciprocity property
between a transmitter and receiver can allow legitimate users to use the chan-
nel response as a shared key because an attacker, who is located in a diﬀerent
location to the legitimate users, has diﬀerent channel frequency responses. The
legitimate receivers can reliably extract the ID information based on the channel
frequency responses of the received frame if the legitimate transmitter sends the
ID information encoded using channel frequency responses.
However, the primary drawback of non-cryptographic device authentication
using channel reciprocity is that the channel and nodes should be stationary.
Thus, it is only applicable to typical indoor environments. Furthermore, from
an implementation perspective, in order to fulﬁll the reciprocity principle at the
Run Away If You Can
379
RF and analog transceivers that have diﬀerent circuitry components, both trans-
mission and reception paths should be calibrated for similarity in the transfer
functions of the forward and reverse links. In order to achieve link equivalence,
calibration schemes using additional circuitries and protocol or signal processing
algorithms are required in the system design.
Dynamic ID Allocation. In the cellular network, temporary mobile sub-
scriber identity (TMSI) can be tracked by eavesdroppers on the radio interface.
Therefore, the cellular network can change the TMSI regularly in order to avoid
the mobile node from being tracked [7]. However, in the latest WLAN standard
such as IEEE 802.11ac/af/ah, there have not been considered the security is-
sue of the unprotected frame header during the design of frame structure. The
PAID is allocated to a station using an AP when the station associates with the
AP, and the PAID is maintained until the station is deassociated. This static
ID allocation allows an attacker to reliably snoop and capture the ID informa-
tion in the wireless channel. However, if the ID is changed periodically based
on a synchronized timestamp between the station and AP, it is diﬃcult for the
attacker to track the target. From an implementation perspective, dynamic ID
allocation is feasible using the time synchronization function (TSF). An 802.11
station maintains a TSF, which is a timer with a modulus 264 counting in mi-
croseconds, and it synchronizes their TSF through transmitting and receiving
beacons. Each beacon contains the timestamp value of a TSF at the AP, and all
stations adjust their TSF considering the propagation and processing delay. As
the timestamp value changes over time, if the AP allocates an ID periodically
based on the synchronized timer, the stations can update their ID when they
receive beacon frames. Furthermore, if the node or group of nodes updates the
ID when it switches channels, it is more diﬃcult to track the targets from the
previous channel.
The primary drawback of dynamic ID allocation is that an adversary can still
intercept the ID information during the same ID period. If the adversary can
locate the ID update pattern through tracking the device based on an alternative
scheme such as device ﬁngerprints, it can analyze the ID update pattern. In order
to reduce the duration of the same ID, the beacon interval should be shortened.
However, a reduced beacon interval degrades the network eﬃciency due to the
increased frame overhead and increases the number of wake-ups of power saving
stations. Alternatively, in order to reduce the ID update interval, stations must
update the ID based on their local timer. In this case, the TSF should be very
accurate during a beacon interval because the IDs are determined based on the
local timer value at the stations. Even though the dynamic ID allocation scheme
is not a complete solution for persistent jamming, it can mitigate the success
rate of attacks.
5.2 Fingerprint Protection
Digital Predistortion. The WLAN standards deﬁne the tolerance levels for
impairments at the receiver. In order to support high data rates and QoS, all
digital receivers are required to include compensation circuits for RF/analog
380
I.-G. Lee et al.
and channel impairments. Speciﬁcally, WLAN receivers include compensating
circuitries such as IQ mismatch correction, DC cancellation, carrier frequency
oﬀset correction, symbol synchronization, and sampling time/frequency phase
tracking. Thus, if a legitimate transmitter predistorted the transmission signals
using a speciﬁed amount of oﬀsets for every packet that can be compensated at
the legitimate receiver, it is diﬃcult for an attacker to track the device ﬁnger-
prints because the periodically changed oﬀsets due to the digital predistortion
scheme are hidden from others. For example, if the legitimate node randomly
changes SNR and timing oﬀset in the range of the tolerance level for every
frame, the attacker cannot track the ﬁngerprints due to the randomness while
the legimitate receiver can reliably decode the frame.
The primary drawback of digital predistortion against malicious ﬁngerprint
detection is that it may degrade a legitimate node that has a residual estimation
error and compensation error due to the ﬁnite hardware resolution. Therefore,
we recommend adaptively using the digital predistortion scheme in frame trans-
mission when the node switches channels due to persistent jamming attacks.
Friendly Jamming. The authors of [25] proposed that friendly jamming could
not provide strong conﬁdentiality because data can be extracted from the cor-
related signals in certain conditions. According to [25], it is only true for simple
modulation systems in narrow bandwidths and low radio frequencies. However,
because the eﬃciency of the jamming signal cancellation is inversely proportional
to the bandwidth and radio frequencies, it is diﬃcult for an attacker to extract
the device ﬁngerprints from friendly jammed signals in WLAN systems that use
OFDM modulation in wide bandwidths and high radio frequencies, if the tar-
get node transmits friendly jamming signals during the unprotected PHY header
transmission. In an implementation viewpoint, WLAN systems which adopt mul-
tiple antennas for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) or non-contiguous
carrier aggregation techniques can easily support the friendly jamming utilizing
the existing hardware resources for transmitting independent spatial streams.
The primary drawback of friendly jamming is that the wireless devices must
have extra hardware circuitries in order to generate the jamming signals and,
consequently, they consume more energy and cost. This scheme may be only
applicable for APs and not for mobile devices because the energy consumption
is an important criterion when evaluating portable devices and sensors due to
the impact on battery life. In addition, friendly jamming on the frame header
ﬁeld leads to degradation in the signal detection performance at the receiver
side of the legitimate node. In order to mitigate this problem, the transmitter
may localize the jamming attack [10] and send a friendly jamming signal using
a transmit power control or beamforming transmission technique [4].
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we examined the limitations of the existing jamming schemes
against channel hopping Wi-Fi devices in dense networks. Even though it is nat-
ural for malicious jammers to attempt to identify target nodes in dense networks,
it has not been investigated in jamming attack scenarios thus far. Therefore,
Run Away If You Can

we proposed and developed a persistent jamming attack to track and jam the
target devices based on the PAID and device ﬁngerprints in the frame header.
Furthermore, we evaluated the eﬀectiveness of the jamming schemes through em-
pirical experiments and demonstrated that persistent jamming can attack target
nodes in dense networks even though they adapt the channel frequency to avoid
jamming signals. The evaluation results conﬁrm the superior eﬃciency of the
persistent jamming strategy in a dense network environment in dense network
conditions. Finally, we recommended four security remedies to protect the PAID
and device ﬁngerprints.
Almost all modern wireless communication systems have the same security
limitation in the frame formats which have the unprotected frame header. For
low latency and high eﬃciency, the frame headers are not encrypted in typical
wireless systems. Thus, any device can decode the signal information and de-
tect the device ﬁngerprints. However, the frame headers of the modern wireless
communication systems include more information for advanced wireless connec-
tivity. If the frame header is not protected, a persistent jammer can track and
jam, or an eavesdropper can track and overhear the communication. As future
work, this study will be expanded in order to improve the detection success rate
of device ﬁngerprints in various channel conditions, and we will implement and
evaluate the defense schemes against the persistent jamming attack.
