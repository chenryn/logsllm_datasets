User: Few days ago I found out that my webapp wrote ontop of the tornadoweb framework doesn't stop or restart via upstart. Upstart just hangs and doesn't do anything.
I investigated the issue and found that upstart recieves wrong PID, so it can only run once my webapp daemon and can't do anything else.
Strace shows that my daemon makes 4 (!) clone() calls instead of 2.
Week ago anything was good and webapp was fully and correctly managed by the upstart.
OS is Ubuntu 10.04.03 LTS (as it was weeks ago).
Do you have any ideas how to fix it?
PS: I know about "expect fork|daemon" directive, it changes nothing ;)
Assistant: Sorry my silence, please.
Investigation of the issue ended with the knowledge about uuid python library which adds 2 forks to my daemon. I get rid of this lib and tornado daemon works now properly.
Alternative answer was supervisord which can run any console tools as a daemon which can't daemonize by itself.
