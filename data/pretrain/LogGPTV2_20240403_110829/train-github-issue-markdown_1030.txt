## Steps to Reproduce
I write a demo for display 51 image widget in ListView Widget, the image
resource are from CDN server, after all the images are showing, the
application use 360+M memory, see the picture down there  
![memory-flutter](https://user-
images.githubusercontent.com/23513781/33362827-ee4c640c-d518-11e7-9811-0aed5bed9a39.png)
all the images's size are only 200+ KB far less than 1MB, the image resource
urls is in the file ImagesSource.dart.txt  
ImagesSource.dart.txt
and my flutter project code in main.dart.txt  
main.dart.txt
Also I write a compare demo by iOS native display the same image resources ,
iOS native just use 70M memory, why the flutter use much bigger memory than
iOS native?
and, there also anther problem, in my flutter demo, when click the image
widget, the home page will rebuild by calling the setState() function, and the
page State build() return a Text Widget instead the ListView widget before, I
think the memory will diminish， but the memory keep the same, I try force gc
but no effect, how the dart gc work?
