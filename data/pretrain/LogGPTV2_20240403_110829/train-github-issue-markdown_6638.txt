As-is, the repository-hdfs plugin isn't going to work at all from what i see.
I'm just plotting what I think we need to do to fix it, before releasing it:
  * Four plugin zip versions are created, none are really tested, none are working (except on windows). For example the `-lite.zip` has no hadoop jars and expects the users to drop hadoop jars in their ES_CLASSPATH. We don't allow this, this is not going to work at all.
  * we need to drop the `-hadoop1` and `-lite` stuff and just one have one jar, we need to get the basics working, walk before we can run. from what i see, things aren't working at all.
  * documentation recommends adding configuration files and similar to the `CLASSPATH` or ES `lib/` folder, we can't do things this way anymore! Its not going to work!
  * security permissions are not correct: it only adds `jaas_nt`. This means that this plugin is only going to work on windows NT platforms: anything else = instant security exception.
  * The use of HDFS should be made reliable (means hdfs2 only), since its a snapshot restore plugin. To me this means two things, fsync and atomic rename. I don't see any synchronization, and the rename it uses for committing does not look like the atomic one (rename2).
  * no tests are failing!
