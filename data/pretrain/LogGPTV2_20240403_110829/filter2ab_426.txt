**ATT&CK Technique Name:** TA505

**Description:**
TA505 has employed fast flux techniques to obfuscate botnets by distributing payloads across multiple IP addresses. [8]

---

### Explanation:
- **Fast Flux:** A technique that frequently changes the IP addresses associated with a domain name, making it difficult for defenders to track and block malicious activities.
- **Botnet Obfuscation:** By using fast flux, TA505 can distribute its payloads (malicious software) across numerous IP addresses, thereby masking the true origin and scale of the botnet.

This approach enhances the resilience and stealth of the botnet, complicating efforts to disrupt or take down the malicious infrastructure.
