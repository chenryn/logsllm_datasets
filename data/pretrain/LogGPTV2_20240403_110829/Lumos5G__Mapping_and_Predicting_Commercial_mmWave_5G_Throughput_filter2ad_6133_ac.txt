### 2. Study Areas and Data Collection

We carefully selected three urban areas with mmWave 5G coverage (see Table 2 for a summary):

1. **Intersection**: An outdoor four-way traffic intersection in the heart of downtown Minneapolis, equipped with three dual-panel 5G towers.
2. **Airport**: An indoor mall area inside Minneapolis-St. Paul (MSP) International Airport, featuring two single-panel 5G towers approximately 200 meters apart.
3. **Loop**: A 1300-meter loop near U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis, covering roads, railroad crossings, restaurants, coffee shops, and recreational outdoor parks.

These areas are representative as they cover both indoor and outdoor environments in an urban setting.

**Table 3: Full Dataset Statistics**

- **Data Downloaded Over 5G**: 38,632 GBs
- **Duration**: 6 months
- **Samples**: 563,840 (per-second throughput with features)
- **Mobility Modes**: Walking (331 km), Driving (132 km), Stationary

For each area, we selected several trajectories and performed multiple walking passes per trajectory (at least 30 times). For example, the four-way intersection had 12 different walking trajectories. Additionally, we conducted driving tests at the Loop area with speeds ranging from 0 to 45 km/h. Our full dataset covers 331 km of walking and 132 km of driving (see Table 3 for other statistics).

### 4. 5G Throughput Measurement & Impact Factor Analysis

Using our collected dataset, we investigate how a wide range of factors affect 5G throughput. This provides insights for feature selection in our ML-based framework (§5). A summary of our findings is shown in Table 4.

#### 4.1 Impact of Geolocation

In 3G/4G networks, geographic location is the dominant factor for indicating throughput performance [20, 25, 26, 53]. However, our initial experiments on 5G networks indicate that throughput performance fluctuates significantly even in areas known to have 5G service. We then studied the impact of geolocation (i.e., pixelized latitude and longitude information, see Table 4).

**Table 4: Summary of Factors Affecting 5G Throughput and Its Predictability for the Indoor (Airport) Area**

| Results ⇒ | UE-Side Factors | CV | Sp. Coeff. | KNN | Statistical Analysis | Simple Pred. Models | RF [20, 54] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (mean ± std. dev.) | (p-val. > 0.001) | (mean ± std. dev.) | MAE | RMSE | MAE | RMSE |
| 57.60% ± 22.24 | 228 313 | 0.021 ± 0.19 | Norm. Test | 240 326 | 51.56% | 40.24% ± 20.94 | 78.05% | 0.68 ± 0.14 | 167 247 | 135 201 |

**Key Observations:**
- Geolocation alone is insufficient to characterize and predict 5G throughput but remains a key factor.
- Accounting for mobility-related factors along with geolocation decreases variation in 5G throughput and improves its predictability.

**Table 5: Statistical Analysis to Show the Percentage of Geolocations Whose Throughput Significantly Differs From Each Other (p-val < 0.1)**

| Pairwise t-test | Pairwise Levene test |
|---|---|
| 69.66% | 70.86% |
| 64.26% | 61.06% |

**Key Observation:**
- Geolocation still matters for 5G throughput prediction. The p-value results (see Fig. 7a) show that, on average, the mean throughput measurements of 70.86% of geolocation pairs for the indoor area significantly differ from each other.

Next, we studied the throughput variability at the same geolocation. The normality test results in Table 4 show that throughput measurements of roughly 48% of geolocations (i.e., almost half the area) at the airport do not follow a normal distribution. To reduce false positives in detecting normal distributions, we used two types of normality tests: (1) D’Agostino-Pearson test [28, 29], and (2) Anderson-Darling test [21]. We considered the measurements associated with a geolocation as normal if they passed either test. We also calculated the mean and coefficient of variation (CV) of throughput samples at each geolocation. Approximately 53% of geolocations have CV values ≥ 50% (see CDF in Fig. 7b). This confirms that 5G throughput varies significantly even at the same geolocation. When we attempted to build ML models using geolocation as the only feature, the models (KNN and Random Forest, see Table 4) yielded poor accuracy, with an average MAE and RMSE of ∼234 Mbps and ∼320 Mbps, respectively. These results indicate that geolocation alone is insufficient to characterize or predict 5G throughput.

#### 4.2 Impact of Mobility Direction

Besides geolocation, we investigated how mobility direction affects 5G throughput. We selected mobility direction as a factor because, unlike omnidirectional signals in 3G/4G, 5G mmWave signals are highly directional and sensitive to obstructions such as the human body or structures [47, 55, 57, 67]. For instance, walking away from a 5G panel will naturally obstruct the UE’s line-of-sight (LoS) to the 5G panel due to the user's body, necessitating the acquisition of a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) reflective path.

We exemplified our finding using data from the Airport area. We filtered data representing two walking trajectories: North-Bound (NB) and South-Bound (SB). The data represents throughput traces collected by walking each of the two trajectories repeatedly for over 30 times. Each ∼340-meter long walking session captured a ∼200-second throughput trace. Figure 9 shows both these trajectories as well as the location of the head-on 5G panels on either side of the mall area. We also annotated the maps with patches where handoffs usually occur (see cyan rectangular patches). We selected the airport area because both panel locations were equipped with single-sided 5G panels, unlike dual-panel installations seen in outdoor environments. This ensured that we were connected to only one side of the panel, allowing us to understand the impact of mobility direction. 5G throughput maps for trajectories NB and SB are shown in Figs. 9a and 9b, respectively. We found that although NB and SB are in opposite directions (with partial overlap in their coverage footprints), their heatmaps are highly different, indicating that mobility direction has a significant impact on 5G throughput performance. Similar observations were made in other areas.

To further quantify this observation, we used Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient to measure the monotonic trend (i.e., a consistent upward or downward trend) between throughput traces. The average Spearman coefficients of throughput traces belonging to NB and SB are 0.61 and 0.74, respectively. In other words, with values above 0.5, throughput traces in the same direction show a consistent trend in the increase or decrease of throughput values along the trajectory. However, the average Spearman coefficients between throughput traces belonging to different directions is only 0.021. Figure 10 further shows the drastic increase in Spearman’s coefficients by grouping traces according to their mobility directions. Similarly, 29.76% of geolocations have throughput samples with CV values greater than 50%, a decrease of 23% (see Appendix A.1.2 for extended results).

#### 4.3 Impact of UE-Panel Distance

Inspired by our findings in §4.2, we took a more detailed look at the geometric relationship among the 5G panel, UE, and moving direction. We identified three geometric factors: (1) the UE-panel distance, (2) the UE-panel mobility angle (𝜃𝑚), and (3) the UE-panel positional angle (𝜃𝑝). We quantified their impact on 5G throughput in this subsection, §4.4, and §4.5, respectively. Due to its high frequency, mmWave signals experience high attenuation as they propagate. As shown in Fig. 11a (the north panel at the Airport), the throughput degrades rapidly as the distance increases. However, the detailed, quantitative distance-throughput relationship differs from one location to another due to environmental impacts. For example, Fig. 11b for the south panel at the Airport shows that the throughput first (statistically) goes down and then ramps up as the distance increases. This is because there is NLoS between 50 and 100 meters due to obstacles (caused by open-space restaurants and information booths) in the mall area. The UE regains LoS beyond 100 meters, and the regained throughput outweighs the penalty incurred by the distance increase.

#### 4.4 Impact of UE-Panel Mobility Angle

We define the UE-panel mobility angle (𝜃𝑚) as the angle between the line normal to the front face of the 5G panel and the UE’s trajectory. It represents the UE’s movement with respect to the face of the 5G panel. As illustrated in Fig. 8, when 𝜃𝑚 = 180°, the UE is moving head-on towards the 5G panel, and 0° when walking along the same direction as the 5G panel’s facing direction. Thus, if a UE is hand-held by a walking user, 𝜃𝑚 = 0° will make the user’s body obstruct the LoS between the UE and the 5G panel, causing performance degradation. We indeed observed this high-level trend in all three areas. However, different geolocations exhibit discrepancies. For example, we identified one “outlier” where 𝜃𝑚 ∈ [30°, 75°) at the south panel (see Fig. 18 in Appendix A.1.3 for the analysis of each panel separately). Despite the user moving away from the 5G panel, the throughput appears to be high. This is likely because the signal is properly deflected by the environment, mitigating any severe performance degradation incurred by NLoS.

#### 4.5 Impact of UE-Panel Positional Angle

We define the UE-panel positional angle (𝜃𝑝) as the angle between the line normal to the 5G panel and the line connecting the UE to the panel. When...
