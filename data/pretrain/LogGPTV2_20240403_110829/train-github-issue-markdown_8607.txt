Can we introduce a new postfix operator for the transpose, like `A^⊤` or `A̕`
?
It would of great help to us who write expressions with a lot of transposes.
For example:
    a = (transpose(s)*A*s)\s*(Q-transpose(s)*p+U*transpose(R)*κ)
and it would more true to form if the multiple calls to `transpose()` were
replaced with something more terse. Even if the language defaulted to
transpose for `A'` unless it knew a complex data type was used when the adoint
is more appropriate.
