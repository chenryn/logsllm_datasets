Test Case:
interface Overload {
    foo(id:"special", value:number):void;
    foo(id:string, value:any):void;
}
class Bug {
    private overload:Overload;
    public call():void {
        this.overload.foo("special", "");
    }
}
Compile with tsc. Observe that there is no error message. Shouldn't the
compiler complain about the fact that this.overload.foo("special", "") is an
incompatible call. E.g. "" is not assignment compatible to number.
