## 0x00 Introduction to Cisco Torch

Cisco Torch is a next-generation tool designed for large-scale scanning, fingerprinting, and exploiting exposed Cisco networks. It was developed to fill the gaps left by existing tools on the market. 

The primary feature that distinguishes Cisco Torch from similar tools is its ability to initiate multiple background scanning processes, which maximizes scanning efficiency. Additionally, it can simultaneously use several application-layer fingerprinting methods. This allows for the rapid identification of remote Cisco hosts running Telnet, SSH, Web, NTP, and SNMP services, and the subsequent initiation of dictionary attacks against these discovered services.

## 0x01 Features of Cisco Torch

Cisco Torch is a comprehensive scanner for Cisco devices. Here are the available options:

```shell
root@kali:~# cisco-torch
Using configuration file torch.conf...
Loading include and plugin files...

Usage: cisco-torch
or: cisco-torch -F

Available Options:
-O          Perform all scans
-A          Combine all fingerprint scan types
-t          Scan for Cisco Telnet service
-s          Scan for Cisco SSH service
-u          Scan for Cisco SNMP service
-g          Download Cisco configuration or TFTP files
-n          NTP fingerprint scan
-j          TFTP fingerprint scan
-l <level>  Logging level
             c - Critical summary mode (default)
             v - Verbose mode
             d - Debug mode
-w          Scan for Cisco Web servers
-z          Scan for Cisco IOS HTTP authorization vulnerability
-c          Scan for SSL-enabled Cisco Web servers
-b          Dictionary attack (use with -s, -u, -c, -w, -j, or -t)
-V          Print version information and exit

Examples:
cisco-torch -A 10.10.0.0/16
cisco-torch -s -b -F sshtocheck.txt
cisco-torch -w -z 10.10.0.0/16
cisco-torch -j -b -g -F tftptocheck.txt
```

## 0x02 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Running All Available Scans

To run all available scan types against a target IP address (e.g., 192.168.99.202):

```shell
root@kali:~# cisco-torch -A 192.168.99.202
Using config file torch.conf...
Loading include and plugin files...
