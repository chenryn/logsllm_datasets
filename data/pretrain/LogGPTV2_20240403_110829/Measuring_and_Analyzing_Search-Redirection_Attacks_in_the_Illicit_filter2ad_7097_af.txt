centrations we observed empirically.
In terms of immediate future work, there is nothing in-
herent to the search-redirection attack suggesting it only
applies to online pharmacies. Even though counterfeit
drugs are the most pressing issue to deal with due to their
inherent danger, other purveyors of black-market goods,
such as counterfeit software, or luxury goods replicas,
might also hire afﬁliates that manipulate search results
with infected websites for advertising purposes.
We ran a brief (12 days) pilot experiment to assess how
search-redirection attacks applied to counterfeit software
in October 2010. After collecting results from 466
queries, created using input from Google Adwords Key-
word Tool, we gathered 328 infected source domains,
72 redirect domains and 140 domains selling counter-
feit software. Using the same clustering techniques de-
scribed earlier in the paper, we discovered two connected
components dominating the network, each in its own
way: one component was responsible for 44% of the
identiﬁed infections, and the other was responsible for
30% of the software-selling sites.
We also observed a small but substantial (12.5%) over-
lap in the set of redirection domains with those used
for online pharmacies. Some redirection domains thus
provide generic trafﬁc redirection services for different
types of illicit trade. However, the small overlap is also
a sign of fragmentation among the different fraudulent
trading activities. We have begun a longitudinal study
of all retail operations beneﬁting from search-redirection
attacks, in order to better understand the economic rela-
tionships between advertisers and resellers.
Systematic monitoring of web search results will
likely become more important due to the value miscre-
ants have already identiﬁed in manipulating outcomes.
Indeed,
this paper has shown that understanding the
structure of the attackers’ networks gives defenders a
strong advantage when devising countermeasures.
