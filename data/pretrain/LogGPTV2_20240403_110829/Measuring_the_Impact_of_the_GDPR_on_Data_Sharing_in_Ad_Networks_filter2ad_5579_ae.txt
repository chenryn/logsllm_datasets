company. Our results are not contradicting findings of previous
work but are complementary: Previous work has shown that Google
has increased its reach (numbers of websites directly embedding
their services) and our results show information flowing through
Google (by other third parties) is reduced.

6 CONCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS
Our measured third-party graphs represent only a small subset of
the real third-party relations of a website. A website might detect
that a crawler is visiting it and embed different objects or none at
all, even though we tried to mask our crawler. Aside from scrolling
and mouse jiggling, we do not interact with the websites, which
might also influence our results because some third parties might
only be embedded if a user performs a specific task (e. g., if the
user starts a purchase process, a third party might be embedded
to handle the credit card payment). We did not interact with any
cookie consent banners present on the visited websites. Therefore,
we might not have observed all cookie syncing attempts and our
results can be seen as a lower bound.
However, previous works found that cookie banners often do not
work as expected [41], do not offer opt-out choices while instead
assume opt-in [55], and showed that the used consent libraries do
not meet other GDPR requirements [15]. In addition, Utz et al. [55]
have also shown that the majority of users does not interact with
cookie consent notices, similar to our approach.
After our first measurement, conducted before the GDPR took
effect, we observed a statistically significant drop in ID sharing
connections within the online advertising ecosystem. It is likely
that the change is related to the GDPR, which imposed stricter rules
on data sharing and allows data protection authorities to fine non-
compliant companies. However, we cannot exclude other factors
that could have caused a change in the ecosystem, like the adoption
of a new technology for ID sharing. We do not measure syncing
attempts other than those using requests (e. g., based on IP addresses
or device fingerprints [56]). To the best of our knowledge, cookie
syncing is still the most prevalent way to share user identifiers. It
is also possible that the change had nothing to do with the GDPR
and are purely coincidental, but the public debates on the topic
around that time suggest a relation. Note that we do not attempt to
measure when companies share all of its collected personal data
with another company at once (e. g., Facebook sharing all of their
collected data with other companies [49]) but rather want to explore
data sharing happening in real time on the browser level.
While the number of companies and the number of direct con-
nections decreased around May 2018, the trend stabilized and the
number of third parties has increased since then. This could be an in-
dicator that some websites only temporally stopped the use of some
services but over time took the necessary steps to use these ser-
vices again under GDPR (e. g., signing data processing agreements).
This observation is in line with other studies [19, 22]. Regarding
the structure of the measured graphs, we did not see a significant
change in the ecosystem. This hints that companies did not change
their business practices but are more cautious when it comes to
the processing of personal data. The GDPR might have caused a
disruption in the online advertising ecosystem as ID syncing—an
important part of the ecosystem—significantly decreased, but nei-
ther revolutionized it as the structures remained intact nor did it
dispatch the ecosystem as some industry-related groups had pes-
simistically forecasted [34, 46]. More importantly, the effects on
Internet users’ privacy might be negative as fewer companies con-
tinue to be present on more websites, increasing their possibilities
to create profiles. The results indicate that the characteristics of
the ad ecosystem did not change during the course of our study.
Cookie syncing is still used in practice, but its extent is significantly
reduced and still declining.
In contrast to previous work (see Section 3), we found statistically
significant changes in the online advertising ecosystem around the
GDPR enforcement date. Other work focused on embedded third
parties [43] or more specifically tracking companies [15] but could
not measure a direct impact. However, this does not contradict
other results as we also found that the ecosystem, in general, did
not change. To a greater degree, our work shows that the effects
of the GDPR might not be directly measurable in all aspects of the
online ecosystem but in-depth analysis is needed to get a better
understanding of the effects of such complex legislation in a com-
plex environment. Future work should investigate how different
companies actually implemented their data sharing practices either
by actively making use of the right to access, granted by the GDPR,
or by conducting expert interviews to understand the reasons why
companies changed their practices in some areas (e. g., data sharing)
but apparently not in others (e. g., tracking). Recent fines [47] and
ongoing legal complaints [6] for lack of transparency indicate that
such aspects need to be studied in more detail.

A GRAPH CHARACTERISTICS
Figure 7 shows the density of degrees of all nodes in our third-party
graphs (normalized). We did not measure a significant shift in the
distribution of links, however, the total number of links shrunk
around 23 %.
Figure 7: Overview of the distribution of the measured de-
grees of all nodes (excluding isolated notes).
B ANALYSIS CORPUS CLASSIFICATION
Table 7 lists direct syncing partners of the companies most often
observed in our experiments. Furthermore, the table shows the
node types (i. e., outer, balanced, center, and isolated). The rows
’Remaining Nodes’ show the mean syncing relations from all third
parties that are not present in our analysis corpus. To increase
readability, we only focus on the first four measurements.
For most third parties, the number of direct partners is reduced
over the course of our measurements. The biggest reduction is
attributed to Google and the only exception is Adform. Interestingly,
the number of direct connections from M#2 to M#3 increases again
in some cases, for example, for Criteo. In principle, the behavior of
indirect partners is comparable to the behavior of direct partners,
which is not surprising as the partners of the partners are dependent
on the direct partners. This means that if the number of direct
partners of one node is reduced the indirect partners is also likely
to be reduced. In general, this means that personal data of users
are less likely to be shared unnoticed with multiple parties.
Table 7: Synchronization relations of the top companies
observed in our experiments. Direct Partners indicates the
amount of direct ID syncing. The node types outer (o), bal-
anced (b), center (c), and isolated (iso) are displayed as well.
