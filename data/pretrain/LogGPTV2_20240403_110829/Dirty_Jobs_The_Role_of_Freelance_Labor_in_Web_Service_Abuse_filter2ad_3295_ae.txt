There are clear demographic differences between buyers
and bidders. Figure 11 shows the distribution of coun-
tries of origin for all buyers and bidders of the abuse-
related jobs categorized in Table 2. (The distribution for
selected workers closely follows the overall bidder distri-
bution.) We extract the country of origin for users from
their proﬁle information. We note that this information
is self-reported and nothing prevents users from being
dishonest; further, we have seen instances where buy-
ers post jobs speciﬁcally avoiding bidders from India,
for instance, providing a potential motive for dishonesty.
Numbers for such countries are therefore a lower bound.
Figure 12: Top ﬁve countries of buyers posting abusive jobs.
The largest group of buyers is from the United States,
and other English-speaking countries feature promi-
nently (UK, Canada, Australia, even India). In contrast,
the largest group of bidders is from India, followed by
neighboring Pakistan and Bangladesh—countries with
a large cheap labor force, substantial Internet penetra-
tion, and where English is an ofﬁcial language or has
widespread ﬂuency.
The country of origin demographics for each cate-
gory reveals yet more detail. Figures 12 and 13 show
the top ﬁve countries of buyers and bidders, respectively,
for each abusive job category in Table 2. Buyers for ad-
vertisement posting (generally targeting Craigslist, Sec-
tion 4.3.2) are primarily from the United States, whereas,
somewhat surprisingly, buyers for human CAPTCHA
solvers are primarily from Bangladesh and India—these
are buyers looking to form teams of solvers. Bidders
from India and Bangladesh dominate white hat and so-
cial networking link building jobs, respectively. Bidders
from the only Western country (US) in the top ﬁve tar-
get article generation, creating PVAs, and advertisement
posting.
5.2 Specialization
Aside from some uniform basic fundamental require-
ments, such as understanding English and having access
to and basic knowledge of the Internet, the abuse jobs
posted on Freelancer essentially require unskilled labor.
As a result, Freelancers need not necessarily specialize—
focus solely on a particular job category—in the tasks
that they undertake.
As one metric of whether specialization occurs or not,
we examined whether buyers and bidders participated in
more than one category of job (for those buyers and bid-
ders who engaged in more than one job). Indeed, bidders
clearly do not specialize. For all but one category, on av-
erage fewer than 5% of the jobs that bidders bid on are
within the same category; the exception is article content

generation, where nearly 15% of bids per bidder are on
other article jobs. Moreover, not only are most bids on
other job categories, but the majority of bids are on jobs
that did not even fall into an abuse category in Table 2.
In other words, for bidders who bid on at least one abuse
job, 70–80% of their other bids were for a non-abuse job.
Buyers follow a similar pattern as bidders, but are
slightly more focused: 10% of a buyer’s jobs, on aver-
age, are for jobs in the same category, while 60–70%
of a buyer’s jobs were for a non-abuse job. Article con-
tent generation again is the one exception, with 30% of a
buyer’s jobs requesting articles.
6 Discussion
Figure 14 illustrates how the various markets described
in this study ﬁt together in the Web abuse chain. At the
lowest level, workers need access to Web proxies (due
to account registration limits placed on IP addresses),
CAPTCHA solvers/OCR packages, and phone numbers.
Utilizing these components, abusers can create Web-
based email accounts, the primary building blocks for
service abuse. The email accounts can be used to reg-
ister accounts for a number of Web services, including
Craigslist, Facebook, Twitter, Digg, etc.
The abusers can then implement various monetiza-
tion schemes with the accounts, most of them involving
“spamming”. The most direct form of spamming utilizes
the Web email accounts to send spam. Craigslist PVAs al-
low abusers to post repeated, daily advertisements, mak-
ing a retailer’s product consistently appear near the top
of the search results. Abusers can use social network-
ing accounts in several ways, the most direct involving
the creation of social links (fan, friend, follower, etc.) for
marketing purposes.
The relationship between this ecosystem and SEO is
subtle: the accounts on social networking sites can also
be used for SEO purposes. For example, abusers may
spam blogs with comments that link to a Web page to ob-
Figure 14: How the various elements of the market ﬁt together
tain more backlinks for the site. Abusers may also sub-
mit links to social bookmarking sites, or utilize forum
accounts to create posts containing links (most often in
the signature ﬁeld). Many of these SEO jobs require con-
tent, either in the form of articles, or actual content to in-
clude in blog comments or forum posts. Lastly, abusers
can also directly purchase backlinks on sites.
7 Conclusion
This paper demonstrates how web service abuse can be
augmented by the use of low-cost freelance labor. Seven
years of historical data have allowed us to collect infor-
mation on abuse-related work on freelancer.com, one of
the largest online websites offering piecework labor out-
sourcing. Potential employers offered jobs such as link
building on social network sites, mass email account cre-
ation, and tasks related to search engine optimization. In
addition, we found that the demand for freelancers to ﬁll
these jobs is being matched by an increase in the number
of freelancers around the world who will compete for the
work.
Freelancer.com, and other sites that offer freelance
jobs and employment are prime sources of new types
of service abuse. The willingness of many freelancers to
take part in these schemes allow those who offer the jobs
to quickly ascertain new schemes and their success rate;
if they are judged to be proﬁtable, the jobs quickly be-
come a staple income for the willing freelancer and thus,
the employer. Services developed by experts to ensure
the security of websites, such as CAPTCHA technology,
are now targeted by employers who hire freelancers to
break encoding and circumvent the site’s security mea-
sures. These trends point to the need for anti-abuse for-
tiﬁcations that will defend against attackers who have a
workforce of virtually unlimited knowledge at an inex-
pensive price. 10

In this paper we document how low-cost freelance labor enables
Web service abuse. Using historical data spanning over seven years,
we survey the market for such abuse-related work on Freelancer.com,
a popular online market for piecework labor outsourcing. We found a
broad range of such activities, including mass account creation, SEO-
related tasks, and social network link building. Moreover, we witnessed
a steadily increasing demand for such services matched by a highly
competitive world-wide labor force.
Freelance labor markets like Freelancer.com serve as an incubator
and catalyst for new kinds of service abuse. Such a general labor pool
allows nascent abuse schemes to be prototyped and evaluated quickly,
and, if ultimately proﬁtable, leads naturally to the efﬁcient commodi-
tization of the requisite services. Mature services, such as CAPTCHA
solving, eventually evolve into standalone services capable of meeting
growing market demand [12]. Modern anti-abuse defenses must, in the
end, contend with sophisticated attackers having a versatile and inex-
pensive labor force at their disposal.
