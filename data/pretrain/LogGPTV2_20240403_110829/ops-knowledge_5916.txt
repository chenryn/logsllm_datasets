User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Server 2012 R2: World Wide Web Publishing service is failing to start I've got Server 2012 R2 running in Hyper-V with Exchange 2013 installed. It's not a critical system - I'm using it to learn Exchange administration.

I went to log into the server tonight after several months of not touching it, to discover that four services are consistently failing to start no matter what I do. The World Wide Web Publishing Service error seems to be commonly caused by a the AppPools folder missing from C:\inetpub\temp\, but that is not the case for me - I've already checked twice.

The services are:


Net.Tcp Listener Adapter
World Wide Web Publishing Service
Net.Msmq Listener Adapter
Net.Pipe Listener Adapter


In the event log are the same four errors over and over:

Event ID 5036, Source WAS


  The configuration manager for Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) did not initialize. The data field contains the error number.


The error number listed is 0D000780.

Event ID 5005, Source WAS


  Windows Process Activation Service (WAS) is stopping because it encountered an error. The data field contains the error number.


The error number listed is 0D000780.

Event ID 7023, Source Service Control Manager


  The Windows Process Activation Service service terminated with the following error:The data is invalid.



Event ID 7001, Source Service Control Manager


  The World Wide Web Publishing Service service depends on the Windows Process Activation Service service which failed to start because of the following error:The data is invalid.

Assistant: I strongly suspect you've got malformed XML in your applicationHost.config file. I'd give that file a once-over as a first troubleshooting step.
