Hello,

I would like to reduce the amount of duplicate information in the log. Here is the current error and call log:

**Error:**
```javascript
expect(received).not.toBeVisible()
```

**Call Log:**
- Waiting for selector `//div[div[@class="eos-date-picker-wrapper"]] >> .SvgDot`
- Selector resolved to an element, but the unexpected value was `true` (repeated multiple times).

Is there a way to condense the repeated lines in the log to make it more concise?

Thank you for using Playwright! üñê
