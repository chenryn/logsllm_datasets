## Abstract
The First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems Security and Privacy (CPS-SPC) is being held in conjunction with the 22nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). This workshop was motivated by several key observations:
1. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent a new frontier for cyber risk, with unique challenges arising from the convergence of computing, communications, and physical control.
2. The field of CPS security and privacy is still in its infancy, and there is a need to develop comprehensive principles, models, and theories.
3. There is a strong need for a premier forum to rapidly publish diverse, multidisciplinary work-in-progress and galvanize the research community.

The accepted papers cover a wide range of topics, including cyber and control-theoretic foundations, intrusion detection, forensics management, vulnerability analysis and elimination, and field studies. We have organized an engaging program and look forward to active participation in this and future workshops.

## 1. Introduction
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate computing and communication capabilities with the monitoring and control of physical entities. These systems typically consist of networked agents, including sensors, actuators, control processing units, and communication devices. While some forms of CPS are already in use, the widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors and actuators is creating new applications in areas such as medical devices, automotive, and smart infrastructure. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its integration with control systems further underscores the increasing role of cyber infrastructures in diverse domains, including process control, power grids, transportation, and healthcare.

Many CPS applications are safety-critical, and their failure can cause significant harm to both the physical system and the people who depend on it. For example, critical infrastructures such as electric power transmission, industrial control systems, and healthcare devices play a fundamental role in society, and their disruption can have far-reaching consequences. Additionally, because many CPS systems collect sensor data non-intrusively, users may be unaware of their exposure, making privacy a crucial consideration alongside security.

Securing CPS differs from traditional cybersecurity concerns, which focus on confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). CPS security must also consider how attacks on CIA properties affect control-theoretic properties such as controllability, observability, and stability.

## 2. Objective and Scope
The primary objective of the workshop is to establish a premier forum for publishing research on CPS security and privacy. To achieve this, we invited submissions from a wide range of interdisciplinary backgrounds, including information security, control theory, embedded systems, and human factors. Below, we outline some major research challenges and promising directions:

### Trust Modeling and Human-in-the-Loop
Modeling and managing trust between the control system and the operator, as well as between components of the control system, remains a significant challenge. For example, the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 highlights the importance of trust in human-machine interactions. Future designs should incorporate additional sensors and more robust trust management schemes to mitigate such risks.

### Cognition, Situational Awareness, and Security
Many CPS are operated under automated controls, reducing the operator's role in routine operations. This can be exploited by sophisticated cyber-attacks, especially when operator fatigue sets in. Mitigating this requires multimodal alert mechanisms and system designs that continuously monitor operator fatigue and cognitive load.

### High Assurance Architecture Challenges
Size, weight, and power (SWAP) considerations are driving the evolution of CPS architectures. For instance, the avionics industry has moved from federated architectures to integrated modular avionics (IMA) to reduce weight and maintenance overhead. Additional research is needed to ensure separation kernels, information flow controls, data isolation, fault isolation, and quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees in these emerging architectures.

### Security vs. Safety
CPS designs traditionally focus on safety, assuming faults are random and benign. However, malicious cyber-attacks can induce multiple simultaneous faults, challenging existing safety designs. Research is needed to understand and formalize the interplay between security and safety in CPS, balancing fail-open and fail-close principles.

### Models of Cyber-Control Interface Dependencies
Formal models are needed to reason about how cyber-attacks and CIA properties affect control-theoretic properties such as controllability, stability, and observability. This will help in designing more resilient CPS.

### Attack Mitigation, Detection, Restoration, and Recovery
Strategies are needed to mitigate, detect, and triage attacks, as well as to address restoration and recovery. These strategies should prioritize mission-critical services and be mindful of the impact on overall system operations.

### Security Maintenance
Regular patching is not feasible for many CPS due to high uptime requirements. A profile of the CPS is needed to identify when and where patches can be applied without disrupting operations.

### Privacy
CPS deployments aim to solve societal problems but often capture sensitive personal data. Designing systems that balance societal benefits with individual privacy expectations is a significant challenge.

We hope that the CPS-SPC community will build upon and add to this list of challenges and research directions in the coming years.
