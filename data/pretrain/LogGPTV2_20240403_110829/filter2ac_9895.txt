ABSTRACT
The First International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Sys-
tems Security and PrivaCy (CPS-SPC) is being held in con-
junction with the 22nd ACM CCS Conference. The work-
shop was motivated by several observations. First, cyber-
physical systems represent the new frontier for cyber risk.
The attack surface imposed by the convergence of comput-
ing, communications and physical control represents unique
challenges for security researchers and practitioners. Sec-
ond, most published literature addressing the security and
privacy of CPS reﬂect a ﬁeld still in its infancy. As such,
the overall principles, models, and theories for securing CPS
have not yet emerged. Third, the organizers of this workshop
strongly felt that a premiere forum associated with a pre-
miere conference was needed for rapidly publishing diverse,
multidisciplinary in-progress work on the security and pri-
vacy of CPS and galvanizing the research community. The
set of accepted papers reﬂect this vision. Papers span cy-
ber and control-theoretic foundations, intrusion detection,
forensics management, vulnerability analysis and elimina-
tion, and ﬁeld studies. We have organized an exciting pro-
gram for this workshop and look forward to active partici-
pation in this and future workshops.

INTRODUCTION
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate computing and
communication capabilities with monitoring and control of
entities in the physical world. These systems are usually
composed by a set of networked agents, including sensors,
actuators, control processing units, and communication de-
vices. While some forms of CPS are already in use, the

widespread growth of wireless embedded sensors and ac-
tuators is creating several new applications in areas such
as medical devices, automotive, and smart infrastructure.
Equally important is the emergence of Internet of Things
(IoT) and how IoT will interface with control systems. As
such, there is an increasing role that cyber infrastructures
will play in existing control systems and in domains as di-
verse as the process control industry, the power grid, trans-
portation systems, and medical devices and systems.
Many CPS applications are safety-critical: their failure
can cause irreparable harm to the physical system under
control and to the people who depend on it.
In particu-
lar, the protection of our critical infrastructures that rely on
CPS, such as the electric power transmission and distribu-
tion, industrial control systems, oil and natural gas systems,
water and waste-water treatment plants, healthcare devices,
and transportation networks play a fundamental and large-
scale role in our society—and their disruption can have a
signiﬁcant impact to individuals, and nations at large.
Similarly, because many CPS systems collect sensor data
non-intrusively, users of these systems are often unaware
of their exposure. Therefore in addition to security, CPS
systems must be designed with privacy considerations.
The challenges in securing CPS are many. But fundamen-
tally, it is important to recognize that securing CPS diﬀers
from the traditional cyber security concerns of conﬁdential-
ity, integrity and availability (CIA) that have dominated the
security of information technology (IT) systems. At its core,
CPS security must be approached and framed from the per-
spective of how attacks on CIA properties perturb control-
theoretic properties such as controllability, observability and
stability.
2. OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
The objective and vision of the workshop is that it be-
comes the premiere forum to publish research on CPS se-
curity and privacy. As such this ﬁrst workshop sought to
set this vision on solid footing, and invited participation
from diverse CPS domains, researchers and practitioners,
and encompassed a range of topics. Submissions were sought
from multiple interdisciplinary backgrounds representative
of CPS, including but not limited to information security,
control theory, embedded systems, and human factors.
To help establish a solid footing for the workshop, we
have documented below some major research challenges and
promising directions. We hope that the CPS-SPC commu-
nity will build upon and add to this list of challenges and
research directions over the years.

The issue of modeling and managing trust between the
control system and the operator, as well as between compo-
nents of the control system, remains one of the most promi-
nent and emerging challenges. As far as trust between the
control system and the operator, consider the crash on May
31st, 2009 of Air France Flight 447 enroute from Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil to Paris, France. Temporary inconsistencies
in both airspeed sensors resulted in the ﬂight control system
disengaging autopilot and autothrottle. In other words, the
control system was designed to give control back to the pilot
(operator) when sensing anomalies occurred, based on the
principle that the pilot is more knowledgeable and can be
trusted to handle the situation better. Unfortunately, in this
case the pilot made an abrupt nose-up input which resulted
in an intolerable angle of attack and the aircraft stalling and
crashing. Perhaps a better design may have been one where
the control system used additional sensors to possibly ex-
trapolate the air speed. For example, the engine speed and
the altitude could be correlated to make reasonable guess
that the aircraft could not be traveling at 52 knots (as in-
dicated by the faulty sensors). Trust management between
the components of a control system is also a challenging area
for future work. In particular, a cyber-attack could subvert
a component whereby the compromised component now be-
comes a malicious insider. System designs which recognize
the criticality and trustworthiness of control system com-
ponents are required. This obviously requires schemes for
continuously assessing and managing such trustworthiness.
Cognition, Situational Awareness and Security.
Increasingly many CPS are operated under automated
controls. In such operations, the operator has a secondary
or in many cases a minimal role in routine operations. The
problem is exacerbated when operator fatigue sets in. A
sophisticated cyber-attack can exploit such weaknesses to
its advantage. Speciﬁc attack steps can be crafted knowing
that operator SA will be low at speciﬁc times. Mitigating
this will require system man-machine interface designs that
continually sense operator fatigue and cognitive load. Alert
mechanisms have to be multimodal (not just on operator
screens). Also, the control system functions and communi-
cations that generate them must be designed in a manner
that they cannot be bypassed by cyber attacks.
High Assurance Architecture Challenges.
Size, weight and power (SWAP) considerations are driv-
ing the evolution of system architectures for CPS. For ex-
ample, in the avionics industry, early designs of avionics
systems used a federated architecture where every function
had its own dedicated line replaceable unit (LRU) computer
and was connected to its own sensors and actuators. How-
ever, as more control functions get automated through digi-
tal controls, the weight, volume, and maintenance overhead
of each system made this approach not sustainable. A new
approach, called IMA (Integrated Modular Avionics), inte-
grated multiple software functions on a single processor so
as to keep the weight, volume and cost of the avionic ar-
chitecture within reasonable limits. Strict partitioning in
software and hardware had to be provided to ensure that
functions did not interfere with each other. These develop-
ments are found in the ARINC 653 and ARINC 664 stan-
dards. ARINC 653 recognizes diﬀerent safety levels for ap-
plications. Additional research is needed to bring separation
kernels and associated information ﬂow controls, data isola-
tion, fault isolation, and schedule-related QoS guarantees in
these emerging architectures for control system processors.
Security vs. Safety.
Traditionally, CPS designs have always accounted for safety.
Safety analyses such as with fault trees typically assume that
faults are random and benign. Many CPS are designed to
mitigate at most one fault at any given time. Such assump-
tions no longer hold in the face of sophisticated and mali-
cious cyber attacks. Such an attack may launch concurrent
actions that induce multiple simultaneous faults in a coor-
dinated manner. While safety designs typically incorporate
checks and balances and related compensating actions, these
could be intercepted by a cyber attack. Furthermore, while
safety concerns encourage a fail-open principle of operation,
security concerns often demand a fail-close approach. As
such, an important research challenge is to understand and
formalize the interplay between security and safety in CPS.
Models of Cyber-Control Interface Dependencies.
Cyber security properties are expressed in terms of the
objectives of conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability (CIA).
CPS and their control systems are concerned with control-
theoretic properties such as controllability, stability and ob-
servability (CSO). The research challenge is to formulate
formal models and principles at the interface of the cyber
and control layers so as to formally reason about how cy-
ber attacks and CIA properties perturb CSO (and similar)
properties and the physical operations of the CPS.
Attack Mitigation, Detection, Restoration and Recov-
ery.
A research challenge is to design strategies to mitigate,
detect and triage attacks, as well as address restoration and
recovery. Triaging attacks, and the restoration and recov-
ery of the system should be mindful of mission priorities
and impact. Not all attacks may need to be attended to
in an urgent manner. Restoration and recovery needs to
be sequenced carefully so that critical services are given the
highest priority.
Security Maintenance.
Patching on a regular basis is not viable in many CPS
systems due to their high uptime requirements. To address
this problem in the CPS context requires building a proﬁle
of a CPS so as to understand which parts of the system
are active (i.e. hot) when and as well as which are inactive
(i.e. cool). For example, a particular pump in a reﬁnery
may only become active once a week (say on a Sunday)
during the weekly maintenance and ﬂush routine. So the
associated PLC controller may be patched at other times
without interfering with mainstream operations.
Privacy.
All new CPS deployments are meant to solve societal
problems and improve our standards of living. Several of
these CPS deployments however can capture personally sen-
sitive data in the process and a big challenge is to design
systems that achieve beneﬁts to society while maintaining
individual privacy expectations.
