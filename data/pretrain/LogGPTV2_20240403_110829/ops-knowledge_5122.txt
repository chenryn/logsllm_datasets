User: Explain the principle and basic workflow of HTTPS.
Assistant: HTTPS is a secure version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols to encrypt network communication data. The principle and basic workflow of HTTPS are as follows: 1. The client initiates an HTTPS request: After the client enters the URL, the browser will initiate an HTTPS request to the server. 2. The server responds with the SSL certificate: After receiving the request, the server will return the SSL certificate authenticated by the digital certificate to the client. This digital certificate is issued by the server authority, and the certificate contains the server public key and information related to the identity of the authentication server. 3. The client verifies the SSL certificate: After receiving the SSL certificate, the client will search for the digital certificate of the corresponding server authority from the local digital certificate store. Verify that the certificate is valid, and if the verification is passed, the client will generate a random key. 4. The client sends encrypted information: the client uses the server's public key to encrypt and transmit a random key, which is usually a symmetric encryption key, used to encrypt data for subsequent communications. 5. The server returns data: the server uses the pre-shared symmetric key to encrypt the data and send it to the client. 6. The client decrypts the data: the client uses the previously generated random key to decrypt the data returned by the server. Throughout the process, SSL certificates and digital certificates are key elements to ensure the security and confidentiality of communications. If they are tampered with by a man-in-the-middle attack, the security of the HTTPS protocol will be destroyed. Therefore, in order to ensure security, digital certificates must be issued by a trusted third-party organization, such as Symantec, DigiCert, etc., and issued by a legally certified digital certificate authority to ensure the reliability and legality of the certificate.
