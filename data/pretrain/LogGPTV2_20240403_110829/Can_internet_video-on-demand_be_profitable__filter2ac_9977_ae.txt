Table 5: 95 percentiles for the month of April 2006
By using peer assistance, even under very conservative
assumptions (the conservative approach), the server band-
width can potentially be reduced by 97.0% at current qual-
ity level. Alternatively, peer-assisted solution can triple the
video rate (with a corresponding improvement in quality)
and still trim the server bandwidth by 37.6%.
It is also interesting to examine the contribution of indi-
vidual videos in the ﬁnal server bandwidth costs. To this
end, we rank the 12, 000+ videos by their popularity and
then classify them into 4 groups: 1) group A contains video
1-10; 2) group B video 11-100; 3) group C video 101-1000;
and 4) group D the rest 11, 000+ videos. We provide the
95 percentile value for each group in Table 6. We make the
serv. rate (Mbps)

Table 6: Server bandwidth cost breakdown across
videos
following observations:
• The top 10 videos contribute signiﬁcantly to the frac-
tion of server bandwidth cost under the pure client-
server model, but much less so with peer-assistance.
This essentially echoes the well-known scalability of
peer-to-peer applications: the more popular the con-
tent is, the easier it is to distribute with peer assis-
tance.
• The top 100 videos account for more than half of the
server bandwidth cost for client-server distribution.
There are again signiﬁcant gains when using peers to
oﬀset the server load. Nevertheless, it is not suﬃcient
to only deal with these top 100 videos, which leads to
the next point.
• The videos in group C also use a large portion of the
server bandwidth, suggesting that a large number of
videos oﬀered by MSN Video are very popular.
• The gain of peer-assisted VoD diminishes for the un-
popular videos. For example, when we triple the qual-
ity of all videos in group D, the proportional server
bandwidth increment is still quite signiﬁcant even with
peer-assistance. Thus we can conclude that it is much
simpler (in terms of system design and maintenance)
to rely on the pure client-server model to delivery such
videos.
Note that the sum of any two values in the table does not
have an accurate meaning, due to the 95 percentile rule.
For instance, the 95 percentile value for the top 100 videos
(not using P2P) is 709 Mbps, which is much smaller than the
sum of the corresponding values from group A and group B. .
Nevertheless, this breakdown into 4 groups oﬀers reasonable
relative comparison and important insights.
4.5 Service Cost Evolution
Finally, we examine the impact of service evolution on
peer-assisted VoD. As described in Section 2, from April to
December, the server bandwidth cost increased by 78.5%
for the client-server deployment due to the video quality
upgrade and the increased popularity of the service. Ta-
ble 7 shows that if a peer-assisted VoD solution had been
instead deployed between April and December, then the
server bandwidth bill of December could have potentially
been trimmed by 93.6%, compared to that of April.

5. THE IMPACT OF PEER-ASSISTANCE ON
INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS
Up until this point, we have described peer-assisted VoD
purely from the perspective of content providers. The main
objective was to maximally utilize participating peers’ up-
load resources so as to reduce the server bandwidth costs.
However, when peers are sending large amounts of data to
each other, much of this data may go from one Internet
Service Provider (ISP) to another and in turn incur non-
negligible costs for the ISPs.
In this section, we take the
concern of ISPs into consideration and explore how peer-
assisted VoD can strike a balance between the conﬂicting
interests of reducing the VoD provider’s server cost and re-
ducing the P2P cross traﬃc among ISPs.
5.1 Economics of ISP Relationships
The Internet consists of thousands of ISPs, which oper-
ate at very diﬀerent scales and serve very diﬀerent roles.
Some ISPs provide Internet access to end-users and busi-
nesses, while others provide access to ISPs themselves. The
relationships between ISPs can be summarized into 3 cat-
egories [5]: 1) transit relationship, which refers to one ISP
purchasing Internet access from another ISP and paying for
the bandwidth usage. This is also called customer-provider
relationship; 2) sibling relationship, which refers to the inter-
connection among several ISPs belonging to the same orga-
nization. Even though each ISP might be managed sepa-
rately from the perspective of network administration, traf-
ﬁc exchange among them does not involve any payment;
and 3) peering relationship, which refers to ISPs pairing with
each other. Peering ISPs can exchange traﬃc directly, which
would otherwise have to go through their providers. This
is a common relationship adopted to lower ISPs’ payments
to their own providers. To a certain extent, the traﬃc ex-
changed between two peering ISPs is free. However, when
the traﬃc becomes highly asymmetric, one party will start
charging the other based on bandwidth usage [6].
Based on the ISP relationships, ISPs can be grouped to-
gether to form economic entities, whereby no payment is in-
volved for traﬃc within an entity but traﬃc crossing entity
boundaries does incur payment. Based on the sibling and
peering relationships, such economic entities can be formed
at two levels: 1) sibling entity includes all ISPs that are
siblings to each other; and 2) peering entity includes not
only all siblings, but also all ISPs that are peering with each
other. Note that a peering relationship is in general not
transitive; however, in peer-assisted VoD, it’s reasonable to
assume that data can ﬂow between two ISPs without direct
peering relationship, as long as there exists a third party ISP
which peers with both of these two ISPs. This is because all
peers in the third party ISP can essentially help to tunnel
the traﬃc.
5.2 Without ISP-Friendly Peer-Assisted VoD
When a peer-assisted VoD solution is deployed without
considering the economics of ISPs, intuitively, there will be a
signiﬁcant amount of traﬃc crossing entity boundaries. We
now use the MSN Video trace to evaluate the potential costs
of peer-assisted VoD to ISPs. Each trace record contains
the public IP addresses of peers, which can be mapped to
ISPs using tools like the ASFinder in the CoralReef suite [7].
Then, based on an inferred AS relationships dataset [8], we
can group ISPs into economic entities. Again, there are
two levels of entities: sibling entities and peering entities.
To keep things simple, we adopt the following approach to
estimate the traﬃc crossing entity boundaries. For each
user, we categorize into the classes the peers from which
the user receives content: 1) from peers within the same
entity; and 2) from peers from other entities. We assume,
at any time, the ratio of traﬃc from these two classes is
equal to the ratio of upload bandwidths for these two classes.
Although not an exact measurement of the crossing entity
traﬃc, we believe this yields a good estimate when peers
are randomly paired together, which is a common practice
in many deployed peer-to-peer systems.
Figure 12, shows the percentages of traﬃc contained within
entities, as well as those crossing entity boundaries. Clearly,
we can see that the majority of the P2P traﬃc is actually
crossing entity boundaries. This implies that a peer-assisted
VoD solution might greatly increase the ISPs’ costs, if de-
ployed without any regard for the ISPs.
Importantly, we
observe that the amount of cross traﬃc is reduced signif-
icantly when the sizes of entities increase. Note that the
cross traﬃc and contained traﬃc do not add up to 100%, as
a tiny portion is coming from the server.

5.3 Pure ISP-Friendly Peer-Assisted VoD
We have just examined the impact of peer-assisted VoD
on ISPs, when the solution is solely focused on minimizing
the bandwidth costs of the content providers. Now, we con-
sider the other extreme, where we restrict the P2P traﬃc to
be contained within entity boundaries. We refer to this ap-
proach as ISP-friendly peer-assisted VoD. In this scenario,
due to the rigid entity partitioning, the distribution of one
video becomes several separate distributions, one for each
entity watching the video. Using the silver stream as an ex-
ample, with either sibling or peering entity partitioning, we
observe more than 5, 000 distinct distributions.
Intuitively, when an entity contains few peers, the sharing
becomes more diﬃcult as well, and the server bandwidth
is increased accordingly. Table 8 shows the server band-
width costs when peers never share across entity bound-
aries. Compared to the scenario where the ISP issue is com-
pletely ignored (Figure 12), the savings to the ISPs are sig-
niﬁcant. Nevertheless, compared to the client-server model,
ISP-friendly peer-assistance still provides more than 50%
savings, which is surprisingly good. This result also suggests
that the inherent ISP clustering among the users justiﬁes ef-
forts for further exploration.

For practical peer-assisted VoD, it is important to strike
a balance between these two extremes. In doing so, deploy-
ments will hopefully provide signiﬁcant reductions in band-
width costs to content providers without generating unac-
ceptable levels of traﬃc across ISP boundaries.
Finally, we point out that the inferred AS relationships
from CAIDA [10], which we used in this study, may be very
conservative. For instance, we examined the following two
ISPs with AS numbers: AS3598 and AS8075. The inferred
relationship between them is classiﬁed as the customer-provider
relationship. Given that, peers from these ISPs will be sepa-
rated into two diﬀerent entities during our above evaluation.
However, these two ISPs both belong to Microsoft Corpo-
ration, and it is likely no payment is involved for the traﬃc
exchanged between them. Historically, the inference of AS
relationships has been conservative [9], which is largely due
to the fact that ISPs are unwilling to share their sibling and
peering relationships. With peer-assisted VoD looming on
the horizon, hopefully ISPs will be motivated to share their
sibling and peering information so that truly ISP-friendly
peer-assisted VoD solutions can eventually prevail.
6. RELATED WORK
Peer-assisted content delivery has attracted many research
eﬀorts, covering several application areas: ﬁle distribution,
live streaming and on-demand streaming.
The popular peer-assisted protocol BitTorrent [11] has
been the focus of several recent studies that address the per-
formance of its underlining protocol. Qiu and Srikant [14]
developed a ﬂuid model to obtain analytical insights. Bharambe
et al. [13] evaluated BitTorrent performance through exten-
sive simulations. Legout et al. [12] have shown BitTorrent to
be close to optimal under a variety of conditions. Whereas
peer-assisted ﬁle distribution is now fairly understood, peer-
assisted on-demand streaming is still an emerging area.
In contrast with peer-assisted ﬁle distribution and peer-
assisted live streaming, both of which have already enjoyed
large-scale deployments, peer-assisted VoD is still in its in-
fancy. To our knowledge, there is no documented deploy-
ment of a large-scale VoD system to date. There has, how-
ever, been a number of proposals for peer-assisted VoD. Cui
et al. [20] proposed oStream, which extends application-layer
multicast to include buﬀers in the peer nodes to support
VoD. Hamra et al. [19] proposed a tree based approach,
where new incoming peers are connected to the nodes in the
tree based on their bandwidth availability. Annapureddy et
al. [22] studied using network coding in the VoD scenario. Li
proposed PeerStreaming [21] to utilize erasure resilient cod-
ing (ERC) and reduce the overall cache requirement. Guo et
al. [18] proposed to segment videos into small sub-clips and
then use a BitTorrent-like approach to share these sub-clips.
Additionally, Xu et al. [16] and Tu et al. [17] considered
queuing performance models for media streaming systems.
None of these work, however, investigates the performance of
peer-assisted VoD using real-world traces. Moreover, none
of these work considers the important issues of prefetching,
ISP-friendly considerations, and balanced mode operation.
7. CONCLUSION
We consider the design and potential beneﬁts of peer-
assisted video-on-demand. Using the nine-month MSN Video
trace, we report on key observations of the characteristics
from such a large scale VoD service. A theory is presented
to explore many of the fundamental issues of peer-assisted
VoD. With peer-assistance and prefetching, we show the
enormous potential cost savings to content providers. We
also examine the costs that peer-assisted VoD might place
on local ISPs and explore how these costs can be minimized.
