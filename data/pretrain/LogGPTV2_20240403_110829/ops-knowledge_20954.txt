User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Please wait for User Profile Service... on WIndows 7 takes around 1-2 minutes to process When loggging into our domain, after entering account credentials the log in process takes around 1-2 minutes before it gets past the User Profile Service, the rest of the process takes 2-3 secs. 

This effects all machines running Windows 7 Enteprise 32-bit and is on fairly high spec laptops (SSD drives, i5 2.93Ghz CPU, 4GB memory). 

Is there any way to speed this up or is this time delay acceptable? 

Thanks in advance.

Assistant: Have you looked for Event Log errors during the time of logon on these workstations? Also, I'd recommend turning on Verbose messages via GPO for some workstations you can troubleshoot on to see where it is taking the longest. 

In a Computer GPO: Administrative Templates\System\Display highly detailed status messages - enable. Run GPUPDATE /force and reboot. Now when you logon you'll get more descriptive messages to help in troubleshooting where the delay is.
