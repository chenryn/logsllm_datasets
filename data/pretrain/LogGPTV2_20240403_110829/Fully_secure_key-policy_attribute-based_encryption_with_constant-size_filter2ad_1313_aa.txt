ABSTRACT
Attribute-based encryption (ABE), introduced by Sahai and
Waters, is a promising cryptographic primitive, which has
been widely applied to implement ﬁne-grained access con-
trol system for encrypted data. In its key-policy ﬂavor, at-
tribute sets are used to annotate ciphertexts and secret keys
are associated with access structures that specify which ci-
phertexts a user is entitled to decrypt.
In most existing
key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) construc-
tions, the size of the ciphertext is proportional to the num-
ber of attributes associated with it and the decryption cost
is proportional to the number of attributes used during de-
cryption.
In this paper, we present a new construction of KP-ABE.
Our proposed construction is the ﬁrst KP-ABE scheme, which
has the following features simultaneously: expressive (i.e.,
supporting arbitrary monotonic access structures); fully se-
cure in the standard model; constant-size ciphertexts and
fast decryption. The downside of our construction is that
secret keys have quadratic size in the number of attributes.

INTRODUCTION
In the traditional public key encryption or identity-based
encryption schemes [35, 10], encrypted data is targeted for
decryption by a single known user; hence, they lack the ex-
pressiveness needed for more advanced data sharing. Many
distributed applications require complex access control mech-
anisms for encrypted data which is stored in untrusted servers,
such as in the cloud. Sahai and Waters [34] addressed this is-
sue by introducing the concept of attribute-based encryption
(ABE). ABE enables public key one-to-many encryption and
is envisioned as a promising cryptographic primitive for real-
izing scalable and ﬁne-grained access control systems. There
are two kinds of ABE: key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) [21] and
ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) [7].
In this paper, our
concern is on the former.
In a KP-ABE scheme [21], every ciphertext is associated
with a set of attributes, and every user’s secret key is as-
sociated with an access structure on attributes. A user will
be able to decrypt a ciphertext only if the access structure
associated with the user’s secret key is satisﬁed by the set of
attributes associated with the ciphertext. This access con-
trol functionality can be very powerful, but also costly. In
most existing KP-ABE constructions, the size of the cipher-
text is proportional to the number of attributes associated
with it and the decryption cost is proportional to the num-
ber of attributes used during decryption. Speciﬁcally, it usu-
ally requires one pairing operation per attribute used during
decryption. To the best of our knowledge, the schemes in
[4, 23] are the only eﬀorts to design KP-ABE schemes with
constant-size ciphertexts1 and/or fast decryption.
In [4], Attrapadung et al. ﬁrst showed that a certain
class of identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) schemes
1Constant-size ciphertexts mean that the size of a cipher-
text only depends on the security parameter and not on the
number of attributes associated with the ciphertext.
239readily yields KP-ABE schemes with monotonic (though
LSSS-realizable) access structures via a generic transforma-
tion. Then, they presented an IBBE scheme with constant-
size ciphertexts, which can be seen as an instance of the
function encryption for zero inner-product with constant-
size ciphertexts proposed in [2, 3] and is implied by spatial
encryption of [12], thus yielding a KP-ABE scheme with
constant-size ciphertexts. Their scheme also reduces the
number of pairing evaluations to a constant during decryp-
tion. However, the generic transformation proposed in [4]
from a certain class of IBBE to KP-ABE only guarantees
the resulting KP-ABE scheme to be selectively secure (i.
e., the adversaries have to make up their mind about their
target before seeing the public parameters), which is a weak
security model analogous to the selective-ID model [8, 13] in
IBE schemes. Moreover, the scheme proposed in [4] brought
in an inner-product instance as a basic building block which
fundamentally demands a bound on the maximum number
of attributes that can appear in a ciphertext.
More recently, based on the KP-ABE scheme (denoted as
GPSW scheme) by Goyal et al. [21], Hohenberger and Wa-
ters [23] presented a KP-ABE scheme in which a ciphertext
can be decrypted with only 2 pairings by increasing the se-
cret key size by a factor of |Λ|, where Λ is the set of distinct
attributes that appear in the secret key. They also presented
a generalized construction that allows each user to indepen-
dently tune various eﬃciency tradeoﬀs to their liking on a
spectrum where the extremes are GPSW scheme on one end
and their very fast scheme on the other. Compared with
the scheme proposed in [4], their schemes do not place a
limit on the number of attributes used in a ciphertext and
have shorter secret key size. However, the size of the cipher-
text in [23] is proportional to the number of attributes as-
sociated with it. On the other hand, the base construction
of KP-ABE scheme with fast decryption proposed in [23]
only supports a small universe U of attributes, where |U| is
a polynomial in the security parameter. Hohenberger and
Waters [23] described how to alter their base construction
to accommodate a large universe U = {0, 1}∗
of attributes,
but relying on the random oracle (RO) model [6].
1.1 Our Contribution
We ﬁrst observe that, each attribute can be divided into
two parts: an attribute name and its value. In most cases,
the total number of attribute names in a system is poly-
nomial, and the possible number of values of an attribute
name is exponential. We use the application scenario in [23]
to illustrate this. In a KP-ABE system, an encrypted email
can be tagged with a set of attributes, such as “from: Al-
ice”, “to: IACR board”, “subject: voting”, “date: October
1, 2013”. The master authority for the system issues secret
decryption keys associated with access structures to users,
such as giving to Bob a decryption key that enables him
to decrypt any ciphertexts that satisfy the following access
structure,
“to: Bob” OR (“to: IACR board” AND
(January 1, 2013 ≤ “date”≤ December 31, 2013)).
In this application scenario, there only exist several at-
tribute names (i.e., “from”, “to”, “subject” and “date”), but
the possible number of values of an attribute name, such as
“date”, could be exponential.
Based on the above observation, drawing on the hierarchi-
cal identity-based encryption (HIBE) scheme with constant-
size ciphertexts by Boneh et al. [9] and the fully secure KP-
ABE scheme by Lewko et al. [25], we present in this paper
the ﬁrst KP-ABE scheme which has the following features
simultaneously: expressive (i.e., supporting arbitrary mono-
tonic access structure); fully secure (cf. selectively secure)
in the standard model; constant-size ciphertexts and fast
decryption. The downside of our construction is that secret
keys have quadratic size, which comprise O(ℓ · n) elements,
where n is the total number of attribute names in the system
and ℓ is the number of leaf nodes in an access tree/structure.
A comparison of our scheme to the schemes in [4, 23] fo-
cusing on designing KP-ABE schemes with constant-size ci-
phertexts and/or fast decryption is given in Table 1. Note
that, we take the KP-ABE scheme for a small universe of
attributes with the fastest decryption algorithm proposed
by Hohenberger and Waters [23] for comparison, since their
KP-ABE scheme for a large universe of attributes relies on
the random oracle model.
1.2 Related Work
The notion of ABE was introduced by Sahai and Waters
as an application of their fuzzy identity-based encryption
(IBE) scheme [34], where both ciphertexts and secrete keys
are associated with sets of attributes. The decryption of
a ciphertext is enabled if and only if the set of attributes
for the ciphertext and the set of attributes for the secret
key overlap by at least a ﬁxed threshold value d. Goyal
et al.
[21] formulated two complementary forms of ABE:
KP-ABE and CP-ABE. In a KP-ABE scheme, decryption
keys are associated with access structures and ciphertexts
are associated with sets of attributes. In a CP-ABE scheme,
the situation is reversed: decryption keys are associated with
sets of attributes while ciphertexts are associated with access
structures. There exists a general method to transform KP-
ABE to CP-ABE [20].
In terms of the expressive power of access structures, Goyal
et al. [21] presented the ﬁrst KP-ABE supporting monotonic
access structures. To enable more ﬂexible access control pol-
icy, Ostrovsky et al. [32] presented a KP-ABE system that
supports the expression of non-monotonic formulas in key
policies. Lewko et al.
[25] proposed the ﬁrst fully secure
KP-ABE scheme supporting arbitrary monotonic access for-
mulas. Previous constructions of KP-ABE [21, 32] were only
proven to be selectively secure. Lewko and Waters [28] pro-
posed a KP-ABE scheme which is “unbounded” in the sense
that the public parameters do not impose additional limi-
tations on the functionality of the scheme. Rouselakis and
Waters [33] improved the eﬃciency of the unbounded KP-
ABE scheme proposed in [28]. Recently, with the distinct
method, Garg et al. [18] and Gorbunov et al. [19] provided
the constructions of KP-ABE for general circuits. The prob-
lem of building KP-ABE systems with multiple authorities
was investigated in [14, 30, 15].
In virtually all existing
KP-ABE schemes, the size of the ciphertext is proportional
to the number of attributes associated with it, and the de-
cryption cost is proportional to the number of attributes
that have been used for decryption. In this paper, we focus
on designing KP-ABE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts
and fast decryption. To the best of our knowledge, besides
the work of us, there only exist two eﬀorts [4, 23] with the

eﬀorts [4, 23] is given in Table 1.
[31] and Lewko et al.
The ﬁrst CP-ABE construction proposed by Bethencourt
et al. [7] was proven secure under the generic group model.
Later, Cheung and Newport [16] presented a CP-ABE scheme
that is secure under the standard model; however, the ac-
cess policies in that scheme are restricted to be in the form
of a AND combination of diﬀerent attributes. Recently, se-
cure and more expressive CP-ABE schemes [36, 25, 29, 18,
19] were proposed. Rouselakis and Waters [33] proposed the
ﬁrst unbounded CP-ABE scheme where the public parame-
ters do not impose additional limitations on the functional-
ity of the scheme. M¨uller et al.
[27]
led another line of research, considering CP-ABE schemes
with multiple authorities, in an attempt to meet the need
of a more general framework where data are shared accord-
ing to policies deﬁned over attributes or credentials issued
across diﬀerent trust domains and organizations. Similar
to KP-ABE, in virtually all existing CP-ABE schemes, the
size of a ciphertext is proportional to the size of its associ-
ated access policy, and the decryption cost is proportional
to the number of attributes that have been used for de-
cryption. Emura et al.
[17] suggested a CP-ABE scheme
with constant-size ciphertexts but policies are restricted to
a single AND gate. Herranz et al.
[22] described a CP-
ABE scheme with constant-size ciphertexts, only supporting
threshold access policies. Recently, Hohenberger and Waters
[23] observed that if one is willing to consider “bounded” CP-
ABE systems, where a value kmax can be set system-wide
as the maximum number of times a single attribute can ap-
pear in a particular formula (or access structure), then one
can achieve fast decryption without an increase in ciphertext
size or encryption time.
Besides the two usual ﬂavors of ABE, another kind of
ABE schemes [1], called dual-policy ABE, mixes features
from both KP-ABE and CP-ABE schemes.
2The measurement is in terms of |G|.
3The scheme proposed by Attrapadung et al.
[4] sup-
ports non-monotonic access structures. We take their KP-
ABE construction supporting monotonic access structures
for comparison.
4In [23], Hohenberger and Waters mentioned that one may
modify their construction to achieve full security using dual
encryption system [26].
