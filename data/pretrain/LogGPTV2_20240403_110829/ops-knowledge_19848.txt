User: I would like to know how can I determine if a python script is executed from crontab?
I don't want a solution that will require adding a parameter because I want to be able to detect this even from an imported module (not the main script).
Assistant: If you want to detect this from an imported module, I would have the main program set a global variable in the module, which would output different things depending on the value of this global variable (and have the main program decide how to set the variable through a flag that you would use in your crontab).  This is quite robust (comparing to studying PPIDs).
