### Formulae 1 and 2

Recall from Section 5 that we introduced two formulae for estimating the Lp norms:

- **Formula 1:**
  \[
  \left( \frac{L(\mathbf{O})^p + L(\mathbf{D})^p - L(\mathbf{O} - \mathbf{D})^p}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
  \]

- **Formula 2:**
  \[
  \left( \frac{L(\mathbf{O} + \mathbf{D})^p - L(\mathbf{O} - \mathbf{D})^p}{2p} \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}
  \]

We first compare the experimental results for these two formulae. The cumulative density plots for the error of our algorithm using these two formulae for Trace 1 are given in Figure 2. We observe that both formulae yield reasonably small and comparable error values. This observation holds for all five-minute traces, leading us to use Formula 1 for the rest of our evaluation.

### Varying the Number of Buckets

We study the effect of varying the number of buckets on the performance of our algorithm. Keeping all other parameters fixed at reasonable values, we varied the number of buckets between \( k = 5000 \) and \( k = 80000 \), with increasing factors of two. Figure 3 shows the results for Trace 2. We observe that increasing the number of buckets increases the accuracy, as expected, but with diminishing returns. The results on other five-minute traces are very similar and are omitted here for brevity.

### Varying Sampling Rate

Recall from Section 4 that we separate the computation for large (elephant) flows using the Sample and Hold technique. By varying the sampling rate, we can increase or decrease the probability of sampling flows that exceed our elephant threshold (i.e., flows larger than 1000). We found that the sampling rate did not significantly affect the performance of our algorithm. Figure 4 shows that even with a small sampling rate (e.g., 1 in 1000), the elephant detection mechanism allows good overall performance.

### Varying Trace Length

Figure 5 compares the cumulative density plots of the error for the five-minute trace (Trace 2) and the one-hour trace (Trace 1), which have the same origin and destination nodes and similar traffic distributions. Despite an order of magnitude difference in the size of these traces, the error remains comparable, and the distribution of the error is also similar. Our experiments on different trace sizes show that the algorithm is robust to changes in the size of the trace, as long as the fraction of cross-traffic is held constant.

### Varying Cross-Traffic

We study the variation in the accuracy of our algorithm based on the fraction of the total flow that a particular OD flow comprises. For OD flows that are very small compared to the volumes of traffic at the origin and destination, we expect the performance of our algorithm to degrade, as the variation in cross-traffic will dominate the error of our estimator. Figures 6 and 7 demonstrate this for various fractions of ingress and egress traffic (using the average of 100 runs). The complete cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the ingress traffic is provided in Figure 8 for reference.

### Computing Actual Entropy

We evaluate the performance of our algorithm in computing the actual entropy (as opposed to the entropy norm) of the OD flows. This computation introduces additional error because we need to use our sketch to estimate the total volume of traffic between the origin and destination. The results are shown in the figures below.
