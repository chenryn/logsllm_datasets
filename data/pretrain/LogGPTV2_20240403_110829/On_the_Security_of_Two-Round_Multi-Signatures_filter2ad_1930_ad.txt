### Improved Text

#### 1. Overview of the Forgery Process
- **Initialization:**
  - For a message \( m \), if \( c_{i,0} = c_{i,1} \), the forger \( F \) aborts. Otherwise, it continues.
  - \( F \) opens \( \ell \) signing sessions by generating random bits \( b_{i,1}, \ldots, b_{i,\ell} \leftarrow \text{rand}(pk_i^*, c_{i,0}, c_{i,1}) \).
  - The final \( \bar{t} \)-value for the \( j \)-th signing session is computed as \( \bar{t}_{i,j} \leftarrow g^{b_{i,j}} \) for \( j = 1, \ldots, \ell \).

- **Verification:**
  - When \( F \) receives the values \( s_{i,1}, \ldots, s_{i,\ell} \) in the \( \ell \) signing protocols, it verifies that \( g^{s_{i,j}} = t_{i,j} \cdot pk_i^{c_{i,b_{i,j}}} \). If an invalid signature is detected, \( F \) aborts.

- **Forgery Output:**
  - \( F \) outputs a forgery \((c_i^*, \bar{t}_i, s_i^*)\) with public keys \( PK = \{pk_i^*, pk_i\} \) by computing \( s_i^* \leftarrow \text{forge}(\bar{t}_i) \).

- **Complexity Analysis:**
  - \( F \) makes \( \ell \) signing queries, three random-oracle queries, and performs at most \( (2\ell + 1) \) exponentiations.
  - The running time of \( F \) is \( (2\ell + 1)\tau_{\text{exp}} + O(\ell) \).
  - \( F \) outputs a successful forgery unless \( c_{i,0} = c_{i,1} \), which happens with probability \( 1/q \).
  - Therefore, \( F \) is a \(( (2\ell + 1)\tau_{\text{exp}} + O(\ell), \ell, 3, 1 - 1/q )\)-forger for CoSi.

- **KOSK Setting:**
  - \( F \) works in the KOSK setting because the forgery does not include any signer other than the target signer.

#### 2. Meta-Reduction
- **Assumption:**
  - Suppose there exists an algebraic reduction \( B \) that, given black-box access to the forger \( F \), \((\tau, \epsilon)\)-breaks the \( n \)-OMDL problem.

- **Meta-Reduction \( M \):**
  - \( M \) breaks the \((n+k)\)-OMDL problem, where \( k \) is the number of times \( B \) runs \( F \).
  - On input target points \( y_0, \ldots, y_{n+k} \), \( M \) runs \( B \) on input \( y_0, \ldots, y_n \) and forwards \( B \)'s Odlog queries to its own Odlog oracle.
  - \( M \) implements the subroutines `target` and `rand` as described, and the `forge` subroutine as follows:
    - If the \( i \)-th execution of \( F \) invokes `forge(\bar{t}_i^*)` and there exists a previous execution \( i' \neq i \) that already computed the secret key \( sk_i \) corresponding to \( pk_i^* \), then the subroutine computes and returns the requested \( s \)-value as \( s_i^* \leftarrow s_i' + (c_i^* - c_{i'}) \cdot sk_i \mod q \).
    - If the \( i \)-th execution of \( F \) invokes `forge(\bar{t}_i^*)` and no previous execution computed \( sk_i \), \( M \) uses Odlog and returns \( s_i^* \leftarrow \text{Odlog}(\bar{t}_i^*) \).

- **Success Probability:**
  - If \( B \) is successful, it will output \( x_0, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( y_i = g^{x_i} \) for \( i = 0, \ldots, n \) after making at most \( n \) queries to its Odlog oracle.
  - \( M \) then computes the discrete logarithms \( x_{n+1}, \ldots, x_{n+k} \) of \( y_{n+1}, \ldots, y_{n+k} \) using a system of linear equations.

- **Equation System:**
  - Let \( P \) be the partition of \( \{1, \ldots, k\} \) where \( i \) and \( i' \) are considered equivalent if the \( i \)-th and \( i' \)-th executions are such that \( (pk_i^*, t_{i,1}, \ldots, t_{i,\ell}) = (pk_{i'}^*, t_{i',1}, \ldots, t_{i',\ell}) \).
  - \( M \) uses the same target point \( y_j \) for all executions in the same component \( C \in P \).
  - \( M \) can derive a system of \( |P| \) independent linear equations in the \( |P| \) unknowns \( x_{n+1}, \ldots, x_{n+|P|} \).

- **Final Computation:**
  - Solving this system yields all the values for \( x_{n+1}, \ldots, x_{n+k} \).
  - \( M \) runs in time \( \tau + \tau_{\text{ext}} + O(n + k\ell) \) and wins the \((n + k)\)-OMDL game whenever \( B \) wins the \( n \)-OMDL game, unless \( M \) outputs failure.

#### 3. Applicability to MuSig
- **Key Differences:**
  - MuSig avoids rogue-key attacks by using a more involved key aggregation procedure.
  - The metareduction holds in the KOSK setting, but the issue arises from parallel signing queries and rewinding.
  - The same metareduction (with minor changes) applies to MuSig, indicating that their security proof may be flawed.

#### 4. Applicability to MWLD and BCJ
- **MWLD:**
  - The metareduction can be applied with small modifications, indicating that the security proof under the DL assumption is flawed.
- **BCJ:**
  - The metareduction can be applied with small modifications, indicating that the security proof under the DL assumption is flawed.

#### 5. Sub-Exponential Attacks on Multi-Signature Schemes
- **k-Sum Problem:**
  - The k-sum problem is defined, and Wagner's algorithm is discussed, which solves the k-sum problem in sub-exponential time.
  - The security of CoSi, MuSig, MWLD, and BCJ multi-signature schemes can be reduced to the k-sum problem, leading to sub-exponential attacks.

- **Implications:**
  - The public-randomness generator RandHound is insecure due to its use of the CoSi scheme.
  - The attacks are related to the ROS-based attack on blind signatures but require the k-sum problem directly.

This improved text provides a clear, coherent, and professional explanation of the forgery process, meta-reduction, and sub-exponential attacks on multi-signature schemes.
