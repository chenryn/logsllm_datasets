The power ﬂow fij from node i to node j can be expressed
as a linear function of the difference between the voltage phase

which states that the net generation at a node i is equal to the

B. Attacker Resources
The true capacities of the transmission lines dynamically
vary over time due to weather conditions (ambient
tem-
perature, wind, etc.) [9], and are, in fact, greater than the
static line ratings assumed by the SO for economic dispatch
problem (Figure 2). Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) lines are the
transmission lines with DLR sensors that report the true line
capacities to the system operator.
Fig. 2: Static vs Dynamic Line Rating
Let ED Ă E denote the set of lines that are equipped with
DLR devices. The complementary set ES “ EzED denotes
the set of lines that are not equipped with DLR technology,
and hence their rating will be ﬁxed to the respective static line
capacity values. Given that DLR deployments are done as part
of government sponsored smart grid projects [8], [9], the set of
lines ED equipped with DLR technology is public knowledge.
These lines will be the ones that are routinely prone to
congestion and hence receive priority DLR implementation
by the operator.
For a line ti, ju P ED, we denote ud
ij as the actual line rating
computed by the DLR software using measurements collected
from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
system.

Thus the DC-optimal power ﬂow problem faced by the SO

We assume an informed attacker. Speciﬁcally, the attacker’s
knowledge includes the network topology, line susceptances,
set of generators, and their corresponding generation limits,
and the cost of generation. The attacker also knows the
nominal demand dj at each node j and the nominal generator
output pi for each i P G. In power systems terminology,
with this knowledge, the attacker can solve for an DC ED
solution which is an approximation of AC ED solution that
the EMS implements on the power system. Note that our
assumption on attacker’s knowledge is not unrealistic given
that all major ISOs publicly disclose historical generation and
demand patterns and the locational marginal prices in day
ahead and hourly power markets.
Since the SO knows the static line ratings and these are ﬁxed
in ED software implementations, we assume that the attacker
cannot compromise them in ED implementation’s memory.
Any compromise to static line ratings can be overridden by
simple built-in checks in power ﬂow implementations. Also,
since the static ratings are typically calculated for constant
(worst-case) weather conditions over an extended period of
time (few months to years), we assume that the attacker knows
their values. This assumption can be justiﬁed by the fact that
the manufacturers of transmission line conductors supply static
line ratings in their product speciﬁcations. Thus, under the
aforementioned constraints, the set of lines ED constitutes the
attacker’s constraint since the attacker only targets DLR ratings
and not the static ones.
C. Attack Objective
Now, we present the constraints faced by the attacker so
that the attack remains stealthy, and the SO’s ED software
admits the DLR ratings manipulated by the attacker. Then,
we formulate the attack policy of the attacker as a bilevel
optimization problem.
Under our attack model, the attacker accesses the actual
ij for lines ti, ju P ED in ED’s dynamic memory

the violation of line ratings by the resulting power ﬂows. To
avoid detection by in-built checks, each ua
ij is constrained
by minimum and maximum permissible limits of line ratings,
an auxiliary variable puij to denote the manipulated dynamic
denoted as umin
, respectively. These limits are also
known by the attacker. For ease of presentation, we introduce
line rating for the line ti, ju P ED. The attacker is subject to
following constraints:

because, the attacker wants to maintain a level of stealthiness,
so he does not choose an out-of-bound DLR value, that may
set off an alarm.
If the DLR value of a line ti, ju P ED is manipulated by
the attacker, then the EMS software will obey the following
constraint for the power ﬂow on the line:

where a` :“ maxpa, 0q. This problem is equivalent to a 2-
stage sequential (Stackelberg) game, in which the attacker
chooses the incorrect DLR ratings ua (or equivalentlypuij) that
(leader) chooses his strategy assuming a best response from the
defender (follower). Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst stage, the attacker
are subsequently implemented in runtime by localizing and
corrupting true DLR values in the nonlinear ED controller’s
memory (Section VI). The attacker’s objective is to maximize
the maximum percentage capacity bound violation of the
power ﬂows fij on lines ti, ju P ED over the true DLR
values ud
ij after the defender responds optimally in the second
stage. This objective can be expressed as Ucappf; udq in (14a).
In the second stage, the defender chooses the generator outputs
p and voltage phase angles θ that achieves min-cost solution to
the manipulated DLR ratings puij for lines ti, ju P ED and
DC-ED, i.e., minimize the generation costs (2) subject to the
constraints (1)-(6),(12),(13). The attacker ensures that under
ij for lines ti, ju P ES, there exists a
given static ratings us
feasible ﬂow allocation that minimizes the generation cost (2),
otherwise the SO will be require to setting off an alarm causing
the SO to initiate other actions such as load curtailment.
Note that the actual generation cost faced by the operator
when incorrect ua are used in the SO’s nonlinear ED formu-
lation will be different than the defender cost obtained in the
stage 2 subgame. In fact, the nonlinear ED is likely to be
infeasible in the sense that the power ﬂows on certain lines
can exceed the permissible line ratings.
The attack model can be summarized as follows. The
physical system consists of the physical components, e.g.,
generators, transmission network, and the loads. Each of these
components send data to the EMS via means of SCADA,
which is part of the attacker knowledge. The generators submit
the cost functions, the transmission network submits the topol-
ogy and the line ratings, and the loads submit the demand. The
attacker uses this data to compute a DLR manipulation based
on his attack policy, and then compromises the DLR values
utilized by the EMS while solving the ED problem. Finally,
the EMS implements the false ED solution by dispatching the
new generation set-points to the individual generators.
Next, we present our computational approach to compute
the optimal maximin attack.
III. CHARACTERISTICS OF OPTIMAL ATTACK
The optimal attack generation problem posed in (14) is a
linear-quadratic bilevel (LQBP) that is, in general, compu-
tationally hard to solve. One of the standard approaches to
solve a LQBP is to reformulated it as a Mixed Integer Linear
Program (MILP), which can be implemented using commonly
available optimization solvers.
Our approach for solving the bilevel optimization problem
(14) is as follows. First, we divide the main problem as 2|ED|
parallel optimization problems where the attacker’s objective
is to just maximize the capacity violation of one DLR line,
in either ﬂow direction. This converts the attacker’s objective
function from nonlinear to an afﬁne function. This subproblem
can be represented as follows:

where x denotes the attacker actions; X denotes the non-
negativity and/or integrality constraints. In the subproblem
of (14), x “ ua, y “ pp, θq, X “ tu P R
ED : umin ď
u ď umaxu. Also, g1, B1 are zero vector and zero matrix,
respectively.
Second, we note that, for ﬁxed attacker action x, the inner
problem is a convex minimization problem, and therefore
strong duality applies. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) conditions for the optimal solution of the inner prob-
lem, we can pose the overall bilevel problem as a MILP [35].
Let, for ﬁxed attacker action x, py
‹q denote the optimal
primal-dual pair for the inner problem. Then the KKT opti-
mality conditions are as follows.

conditions are reformulated into integrality constraints.
Thus, the bilevel subproblem can be restated as a single-
level mixed-integer linear program (MILP).

Our approach is summarized in Algorithm 1. The proce-
dure GETOPTIMALATTACK() initializes the optimal attacker
strategy and optimal attacker gain to zero. It constructs the
MILP model with the KKT conditions for the inner problem
and the feasibility constraints for the outer decision variables,
by calling the procedure GETMILPMODEL(). Then, for each
DLR line and each ﬂow direction, GETEDGEATTACK sets the
objective function as the percentage capacity violation for that
line. During each iteration, if the attacker’s gain computed is
larger than the previously computed value, then the values for
the optimal attacker’s gain and the corresponding optimal at-
tack strategy are updated. As we will see in Section IV-B, this
computational approach is indeed scalable to larger networks.
IV. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS
We discuss the structure of optimal attacks on benchmark
power networks with DLRs, and discuss its implications on
line capacity violations and increased generation costs.
