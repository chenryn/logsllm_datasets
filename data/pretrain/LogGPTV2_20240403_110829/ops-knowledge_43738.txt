User: I looked around the web, couldn't really find, guess I'm searching wrong.
I try to import a file I built.
In cmd to use it I used a cd command and and just used it.
In shell it keeps on telling me: 

[ Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in 
      from ch09 import * ImportError: No module named 'ch09' ]

(Im just learning python my self hence ch09)
please if someone can help me with this, even both in cmd not to use cd, though it fine, but more important in shell).
Thanks, Josh.
Assistant: You have to be in the directory in which the file is located in order to import it from another script or from the interactive shell.
So you should either put the script trying to import ch09 in the same folder as ch09.py or you should use os.chdir to cd to the directory internally.
