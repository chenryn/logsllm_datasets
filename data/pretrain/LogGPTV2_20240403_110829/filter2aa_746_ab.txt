From here you could easily feed this into RPZ or other 
technology to protect your organization.  But we want 
more. 
How to set up surveillance on a DGA 
 Easy to set up with shell scripting and a non-
t1.micro AWS instance. 
 Requires GNU parallel and adns-tools to 
handle bulk DNS queries. 
DGA surveillance 
 Pre-generate all domains 2 days before to 2 days 
in future. 
 Pipe all those domains into adnshost using 
parallel to limit the number of lines. 
 Able to process over 700,000 domains inside 10 
minutes (and I’m not done optimizing). 
parallel -j4 --max-lines=3500 --pipe adnshost -a -f > $outputfile

This is active not-known-sinkhole domains 
current resolving. 
A note on intelligence bias 
 How we look at threats and what we tend to 
do with information will affect how we gather 
intel and how we process it. 
 I tend to be involved in takedowns so I am 
generally uninterested in sinkholes. 
 If you protect an organization, however, you 
care about your client machines reaching out 
to sinkholes because they are still infected.

Seems like a good list to firewall… 
More on that in a moment. 
Should also check NS info too

With these two data points you can usually 
quickly validate what is a sinkhole and what is 
likely malicious and bears further investigation. 
DGA Surveillance 
 Looking at those four data points you now 
have solid information to make decisions 
based on the data. 
 You could block domains/IPs. 
 You could block nameservers (some times). 
Adversarial Response 
 Adversaries know we are doing this. 
 In response: 
 They change seeds frequently 
 They have non-DGA communication 
mechanisms 
 They engage in counterintelligence 
Counterintelligence 
 The tactics by which an adversary thwarts 
attempts to gather information on itself. 
 Remember the domain and IP lists before? 
 What if an adversary registers domains that 
they aren’t using? 
Counterintelligence – or worse version 
 What if adversary knows you pump these IP lists directly into 
your firewall (and I know people do this with my feeds)? 
 Anyone recognize these IP addresses? They are the DNS Root

Counterintelligence – or worse version 
 Taking action on information without analysis is 
generally a bad idea, especially when the 
information is under the complete control of the 
adversary. 
 This is why intelligence analysis is so important. 
 (I whitelisted the root servers after I noticed an 
adversary tried to do an attack similar to this.) 
Whois Registrar Intel 
 Often actors may re-use registrant information 
across different campaigns.  There may be other 
indicators too. 
 Sometimes *even with WHOIS privacy protection* 
it may be possible to correlate domains and by 
extension the actor. 
 Most criminal prosecution in cybercrime is due to 
an OPSEC fail and the ability to map backwards in 
time of what the actor did to find that fail that 
exposes them. 
Whois Info 
• Many actors will use WHOIS protection… some just use fake 
information. 
• “David Bowers” is common for Bedep.

But why stop with just known DGAs, what other domains are associated with “David 
Bowers”?

Surveillance is nice, what about notification? 
 Creation of feeds and intake is still a passive 
tactic. 
 It is all possible to automate notifications 
when key changes happen to allow for more 
near-time actions. 
 This uses the Pushover application (Apple and 
Google stores) which has a very simple API.

Pivoting 
 Now that I know the-fancastar.com and j-
manage.com serve NS for Matsnu, I can see what 
else is served by those nameservers to find 
additional intelligence. 
 As of 24 Aug, this has switched to nausoccer.net 
and kanesth.com 
 Caution is due, this may not always yield results 
and may yield false positives.  Always correlate 
with something else before making a final 
judgement.

Last adversarial response 
 Starting to see sinkhole-aware malware. 
 Some malware always authenticated the C2, 
but sinkholes still could gather intel. 
 Now malware is being written to attempt to 
bypass sinkholes altogether. 
The Future? 
 DGAs will be around for awhile as part of 
several methods of communication to victim 
machines. 
 Tor/I2P will continue to be used because of its 
advantages but DGAs still needed due to ease 
of blocking tor. 
 Increase in the use of “interesting” dynamic 
seeds.
