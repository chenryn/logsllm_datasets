Normally the columns in a row should float left in a row. When the row becomes
to small for wrapping the columns, the columns should stack below and float
again. Why is my last column not stacking in the small screen size (sm).
Instead it floats also to the left on the first row of columns and dissapears
behind the other, so it is not visible anymore. This is only with the class
col-sm-12.
Now I solved it with col-sm-11 and that is stacking properly, but it is not
what it should have been.
