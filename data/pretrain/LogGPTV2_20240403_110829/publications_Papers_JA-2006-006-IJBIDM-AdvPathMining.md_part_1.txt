Abstract: Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) provide a fundamental
technological infrastructure to define and manage business processes
efficiently. WfMS logs contain valuable data that can be used to discover and
extract knowledge about the execution of workflows and processes. One piece
of important and useful information that can be discovered is related to the
prediction of the path that will be followed during the execution of a workflow.
We call this type of discovery, path mining. In this paper, we present and
describe how path mining can be achieved using different data mining
techniques including the Multimethod approach.

Web process and workflow path mining using the Multimethod approach 305
1 Introduction
E-commerce and e-services have been growing at a very fast pace. The web,
coupled with e-commerce and e-services, is enabling a new networked economy
(Sheth et al., 1999). The scope of activities that processes span has moved from
intra-enterprise workflows, predefined inter-enterprise and business-to-business
processes, to dynamically defined web processes among cooperating organisations.
Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) provide a fundamental technological
infrastructure to define and manage business processes efficiently. A BPMS represents a
single, unified modelling, integration, and execution environment that can be applied
to the implementation of business processes (Smith and Fingar, 2003). These systems can
manage web processes and workflows orchestrating web services and activities
respectively.
Currently, organisations use BPMS, such as Workflow Management Systems
(WfMS), to support a wide range of distinct applications (CAPA, 1997; Kang et al.,
1999; Q-Link, 2002; Anyanwu et al., 2003; Hall et al., 2003; Luo et al., 2003), such
as insurance claims, bank loans, bioinformatics experiments, healthcare procedures,
telecommunication services, military plans, and school administration. Applications can
be more oriented to support or enhance existing processes, to increase competitive
advantage, to reduce costs, and also to manage critical infrastructures. According to the
Aberdeen Group’s estimates, spending in the Business Process Management software
sector (which includes workflow systems) reached $2.26 billion in 2001 (Cowley, 2002).
With the emergence of web services, WfMS have become essential to support,
manage, and enact web processes, both between companies and within the firm itself
(Sheth et al., 1999). WfMS are systems capable of both generating and collecting
considerable amounts of data describing the execution of business processes.
The data generated from the execution of processes are rich with concealed
information that can be used for making intelligent business decisions (Agrawal et al.,
1998; Weijters and van der Aalst, 2001; Grigoria et al., 2004). This data is stored in
a process log system that records all of the events for all of the processes being executed
by the enactment service. Therefore, organisations are increasingly placing emphasis on
category of knowledge as the key to providing them with a competitive edge and
supporting the strategic decision making process.
One important and useful piece of knowledge to discover and extract from
BPMS logs is the set of implicit rules that govern the path of web services or workflow
activities followed during the execution of a process. We call this discovery, path mining
(Cardoso, 2005). Path mining is vital to systems, applications, and algorithms that need to
carry out path prediction procedures to processes. It allows for intelligent analysis by
using data mining algorithms on BPMS logs. The knowledge obtained allows the
understanding of the causes of specific behaviours, such as the execution of certain paths
in a process instance. The crucial goal of path mining is prediction – and predictive
data mining is the most common type of data mining and one that has the most direct
business applications. Path mining generates a number of scientific and practical
challenges. For example, which paths can be discovered and how much data is needed to
provide useful information.

In web processes and workflows for e-commerce applications, suppliers and
customers define a binding agreement or contract between the parties involved,
specifying Quality of Service (QoS) items such as products or services to be delivered,
deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services (Cardoso et al., 2002, 2004;
Gillmann et al., 2002). The management of QoS metrics directly impacts the success of
organisations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when services or products are
created or managed using web processes and workflows, the underlying management
engine must accept the specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the
QoS rendered to customers.
The concept of path mining can be used effectively in many business applications
to estimate the QoS of web processes and workflows (Cardoso et al., 2004) since the
estimation requires the prediction of paths. Path mining allows better and more accurate
predictive algorithms to be built, making it possible to compute the QoS for processes
automatically based on the QoS of atomic activities.
This paper presents a very systematic way to achieve process path mining, illustrating
the fundamental concepts of path mining in practice. We apply different data mining
techniques, including the Multimethod approach (Lenic and Kokol, 2002), J48
(Weka, 2004), Naïve Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimisation (Platt, 1999), and
MultiBoost (Webb, 2000) to conveniently extract knowledge related to paths.
The experimental results presented in this paper are very encouraging and open a new
door for business process intelligence (BPI) (Grigoria et al., 2004) and process mining
research.
This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents background information about
business processes, workflows, and WfMS to bring in some basic knowledge to readers.
Section 3 introduces the concept of process path mining and described the Multimethod
approach. Section 4 discusses web processes and their relationship with workflows.
We describe the basic elements that compose a process and list the most prominent
process specification languages. We illustrate a scenario that will be used throughout
this paper to exemplify the applicability of path mining. In Section 5 we present the
procedure and the main steps involved in process path mining. Section 6 describes the
fundamental aspects of the Multimethod approach and what makes it unique compared to
other data mining methods. Section 7 presents the experiments that have been conducted
and the results obtained. Section 8 presents the related work that has been made in the
research area of process mining, process path mining, and data mining. Finally, Section 9
presents our conclusions.
2 Business processes, workflows, and WfMS
A business process is a set of activities that represent all the alternative methods of
performing the work needed to achieve a business objective. The set of structured
activities produce a specific service or product for a particular customer or customers.
An activity, or task, is a specific action carried out in the context of a business process
that occurs over time and that has recognisable results. Activities take one or more kinds
of input and create an output that is of value to the customer. Activities use resources to
produce products and services.

Business processes exist in all the departments of an organisation, such as human
resources, finance, legal, engineering and operations, sales and marketing, and customer
service department. Examples of business processes include loan application evaluation,
travel expense report editing, and insurance claim processing.
Workflows and Workflow Management Systems provide an execution environment
for controlling, monitoring, and deploying the code necessary to automate a business
process. Workflows are the automation of business processes and they can provide the
following benefits to an organisation:
• real-time business performance monitoring
• remote process management
• enhanced performance and reduce bottlenecks
• cuts operations costs
• reduce paper
• increases customer satisfaction.
A workflow is implemented in accordance with a business process specification and
execution paradigm. Figure 1 shows the main components of a WfMS environment.
Under a WfMS, a workflow model is first created to specify organisational business
processes, and then workflow instances are created to carry out the actual steps described
in the workflow model.
Figure 1 A workflow and its integration with external resources
During the execution, the workflow instances can access legacy systems, databases,
applications, and can interact with users. A workflow can automatically start processes
without user participation and make intelligent decisions based on information captured.
Workflow systems have been installed and deployed successfully in a wide spectrum
of organisations. Most workflow management systems, both products and research
prototypes, are rather monolithic and aim at providing fully-fledged support for the
widest possible application spectrum. The same WfMS can be deployed in various
domains, such as bio-informatics, healthcare, telecommunications, military, and school
administration.

3 Process path mining and the Multimethod approach
3.1 Introduction to process path mining
A process definition is used to specify the activities (i.e., workflow activities of web
services) to be executed and the order in which this is supposed to be done. For that,
conditions are usually specified in the definition, which correspond to causal
dependencies between the activities. The WfMC (2002) identifies the following four
basic types of relationship between the activities:
• sequential: several activities are executed in sequence
• parallel: two or more activity instances are executed in parallel
• conditional: one branch is selected and taken from multiple alternative workflow
branches
• iteration: a workflow activity cycle involving the repetitive execution of one or more
workflow activities.
During the execution of workflow processes, logical expressions may be evaluated by
the workflow engine to decide the sequence of activity execution within a process.
These expressions are evaluated against a set of workflow variables, which are specified
in the workflow definition and whose values can be altered during execution of the
workflow. Figure 2 shows two logical expressions, namely f(a , …, a ) and g(b , …, b ).
1 n 1 m
These expressions are commonly referred to as transition conditions.
Process path mining is the procedure to predict the sequence of activity, within a
process, that will be executed at runtime by the workflow engine. The sequence of
activity if directly related to the workflow variables. For example, let us consider the
process illustrated in the Figure 2. During the execution of this process three different
paths can be followed to complete the process: path A, path B, and path C. Predicting the
path that will be followed is of an enormous importance for business process
management systems. If a path can be correctly predicted, it is possible to predict the
time a process will need to be completed, the cost for executing a process, and to predict
the reliability (Cardoso et al., 2004) of a process (since some paths may be more likely to
contain activities that will fail at runtime).

3.2 The Multimethod approach
To carry out path mining two main techniques can be used: stochastic analysis and data
mining. Both techniques use the data stored in a BPMS log. These data is generated by
the BPMS enactment service when executing process instances.
Stochastic analysis involves determining the probabilities of a specific path of a
process (i.e., a sequence of activities) to be followed at runtime. This technique can be
explored using the SWR algorithm that we have previously developed (Cardoso, 2002).
Data mining can also be used. In this paper we explore the use of data mining techniques
to predict the path of a process that will be followed at runtime. The data mining
algorithms that we will study include J48 (an implementation of C4.5), Naïve Bayes,
Sequential Minimal Optimisation, and Multiboost. This last algorithm has been
developed by one of the authors of this paper and proves to outperform the other
algorithms based on single methods.
4 Web processes and workflows
Workflows have been mainly known for their implementation and deployment within
organisational boundaries. Web processes can be viewed as an evolution of workflows
since they enable application integration within and across organisational boundaries.
Therefore, workflows can be made available as web processes.
Web processes and workflows represent the automation of a business process, in
whole or part, during which documents, information or activities are passed from one
participant to another, according to a set of rules, and are made up of elements which
comprise transitions, logic conditions, data flows, parallel and conditional building
blocks, starting and ending points, splits, and joins. Web processes can be viewed
as workflows that manage web services instead of tasks (Cardoso and Sheth, 2003)
and these workflow management systems can also be used to enact web processes.
For example, a web process can be invoked by an outside vendor submitting a request for
a price quote. In this scenario, a web process can control the flow of a set of web services
that make up an application. The correspondence between web processes and workflows
is extremely important because it allows the use of earlier studies, research, and
development in the area of workflow management systems to be applied to web
processes (Cardoso et al., 2004). The similarity of web processes and workflows allows
us to conclude that the path mining technique described in this paper can be applied to
both types of processes. Hereafter, we will use the term ‘process’ to refer to web
processes and workflows. We will also use the terminology defined by the WfMC
(the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC, 2002)).
4.1 Processes’ basic elements
A process is composed of activities (Web services or tasks) and transitions. Activities are
represented using circles and transitions are represented using arrows. Transitions express
dependencies between activities. Activities with more than one outgoing transition can be
classified as an and-split or xor-split. And-split web services enable all their outgoing
transitions after completing their execution. Xor-split activities enable only one outgoing
transition after completing their execution. And-split activities are represented with a ‘•’
310 J. Cardoso and M. Lenič
and xor-split activities are represented with a ‘⊕‘. An activity with more than one
incoming transition can be classified as an and-join or xor-join. And-join activities
start their execution when all their incoming transitions are enabled. Xor-join activities
