**Abstract:**
Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) provide a fundamental technological infrastructure for defining and managing business processes efficiently. WfMS logs contain valuable data that can be used to discover and extract knowledge about the execution of workflows and processes. One important piece of information that can be discovered is related to the prediction of the path that will be followed during the execution of a workflow, a process known as path mining. In this paper, we present and describe how path mining can be achieved using different data mining techniques, including the Multimethod approach.

**1. Introduction**

E-commerce and e-services have been growing rapidly, with the web, coupled with e-commerce and e-services, enabling a new networked economy (Sheth et al., 1999). The scope of activities that processes span has expanded from intra-enterprise workflows and predefined inter-enterprise and business-to-business processes to dynamically defined web processes among cooperating organizations. Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) provide a fundamental technological infrastructure for defining and managing business processes efficiently. BPMS represents a single, unified modeling, integration, and execution environment that can be applied to the implementation of business processes (Smith and Fingar, 2003). These systems can manage web processes and workflows by orchestrating web services and activities, respectively.

Currently, organizations use BPMS, such as Workflow Management Systems (WfMS), to support a wide range of distinct applications, including insurance claims, bank loans, bioinformatics experiments, healthcare procedures, telecommunication services, military plans, and school administration. Applications can be more oriented to support or enhance existing processes, increase competitive advantage, reduce costs, and manage critical infrastructures. According to the Aberdeen Group’s estimates, spending in the Business Process Management software sector, which includes workflow systems, reached $2.26 billion in 2001 (Cowley, 2002).

With the emergence of web services, WfMS have become essential for supporting, managing, and enacting web processes, both between companies and within firms (Sheth et al., 1999). WfMS are capable of generating and collecting considerable amounts of data describing the execution of business processes. This data is rich with concealed information that can be used for making intelligent business decisions (Agrawal et al., 1998; Weijters and van der Aalst, 2001; Grigoria et al., 2004). The data is stored in a process log system that records all events for all processes being executed by the enactment service. Therefore, organizations are increasingly placing emphasis on this category of knowledge as the key to providing them with a competitive edge and supporting the strategic decision-making process.

One important and useful piece of knowledge to discover and extract from BPMS logs is the set of implicit rules that govern the path of web services or workflow activities followed during the execution of a process. This discovery, called path mining (Cardoso, 2005), is vital for systems, applications, and algorithms that need to carry out path prediction procedures for processes. It allows for intelligent analysis using data mining algorithms on BPMS logs. The knowledge obtained helps understand the causes of specific behaviors, such as the execution of certain paths in a process instance. The crucial goal of path mining is prediction, and predictive data mining is the most common type of data mining with the most direct business applications. Path mining generates several scientific and practical challenges, such as discovering which paths can be identified and determining how much data is needed to provide useful information.

In web processes and workflows for e-commerce applications, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement or contract specifying Quality of Service (QoS) items, such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services (Cardoso et al., 2002, 2004; Gillmann et al., 2002). The management of QoS metrics directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when services or products are created or managed using web processes and workflows, the underlying management engine must accept the specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the QoS rendered to customers.

The concept of path mining can be effectively used in many business applications to estimate the QoS of web processes and workflows (Cardoso et al., 2004) since the estimation requires the prediction of paths. Path mining allows for better and more accurate predictive algorithms, making it possible to compute the QoS for processes automatically based on the QoS of atomic activities.

This paper presents a systematic way to achieve process path mining, illustrating the fundamental concepts of path mining in practice. We apply different data mining techniques, including the Multimethod approach (Lenic and Kokol, 2002), J48 (Weka, 2004), Naïve Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimisation (Platt, 1999), and MultiBoost (Webb, 2000), to extract knowledge related to paths. The experimental results presented in this paper are encouraging and open new doors for business process intelligence (BPI) (Grigoria et al., 2004) and process mining research.

**2. Business Processes, Workflows, and WfMS**

A business process is a set of activities that represent all the alternative methods of performing the work needed to achieve a business objective. The set of structured activities produces a specific service or product for a particular customer or customers. An activity, or task, is a specific action carried out in the context of a business process that occurs over time and has recognizable results. Activities take one or more kinds of input and create an output that is of value to the customer. Activities use resources to produce products and services.

Business processes exist in all departments of an organization, such as human resources, finance, legal, engineering, operations, sales, marketing, and customer service. Examples of business processes include loan application evaluation, travel expense report editing, and insurance claim processing.

Workflows and Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) provide an execution environment for controlling, monitoring, and deploying the code necessary to automate a business process. Workflows are the automation of business processes and offer the following benefits to an organization:
- Real-time business performance monitoring
- Remote process management
- Enhanced performance and reduced bottlenecks
- Reduced operational costs
- Decreased paper usage
- Increased customer satisfaction

A workflow is implemented according to a business process specification and execution paradigm. Figure 1 shows the main components of a WfMS environment. Under a WfMS, a workflow model is first created to specify organizational business processes, and then workflow instances are created to carry out the actual steps described in the workflow model.

**Figure 1: A workflow and its integration with external resources**

During execution, workflow instances can access legacy systems, databases, applications, and interact with users. A workflow can automatically start processes without user participation and make intelligent decisions based on captured information. Workflow systems have been successfully installed and deployed in a wide spectrum of organizations. Most WfMS, both products and research prototypes, are monolithic and aim to provide full-fledged support for the widest possible application spectrum. The same WfMS can be deployed in various domains, such as bio-informatics, healthcare, telecommunications, military, and school administration.

**3. Process Path Mining and the Multimethod Approach**

**3.1 Introduction to Process Path Mining**

A process definition specifies the activities (i.e., workflow activities or web services) to be executed and the order in which they should be performed. Conditions are usually specified in the definition, corresponding to causal dependencies between the activities. The WfMC (2002) identifies four basic types of relationships between activities:
- **Sequential:** Several activities are executed in sequence.
- **Parallel:** Two or more activity instances are executed in parallel.
- **Conditional:** One branch is selected from multiple alternative workflow branches.
- **Iteration:** A workflow activity cycle involving the repetitive execution of one or more workflow activities.

During the execution of workflow processes, logical expressions may be evaluated by the workflow engine to decide the sequence of activity execution within a process. These expressions are evaluated against a set of workflow variables, which are specified in the workflow definition and whose values can be altered during execution. Figure 2 shows two logical expressions, f(a₁, …, aₙ) and g(b₁, …, bₘ), commonly referred to as transition conditions.

**Process path mining** is the procedure to predict the sequence of activities within a process that will be executed at runtime by the workflow engine. The sequence of activities is directly related to the workflow variables. For example, consider the process illustrated in Figure 2. During the execution of this process, three different paths can be followed to complete the process: path A, path B, and path C. Predicting the path that will be followed is of great importance for business process management systems. If a path can be correctly predicted, it is possible to predict the time a process will need to be completed, the cost for executing a process, and the reliability of a process (since some paths may be more likely to contain activities that will fail at runtime).

**Figure 2: Process path prediction**

**3.2 The Multimethod Approach**

To carry out path mining, two main techniques can be used: stochastic analysis and data mining. Both techniques use the data stored in a BPMS log, generated by the BPMS enactment service when executing process instances.

Stochastic analysis involves determining the probabilities of a specific path of a process (i.e., a sequence of activities) being followed at runtime. This technique can be explored using the SWR algorithm (Cardoso, 2002). Data mining can also be used. In this paper, we explore the use of data mining techniques to predict the path of a process that will be followed at runtime. The data mining algorithms studied include J48 (an implementation of C4.5), Naïve Bayes, Sequential Minimal Optimisation, and MultiBoost. The latter algorithm, developed by one of the authors, outperforms the other algorithms based on single methods.

**4. Web Processes and Workflows**

Workflows have traditionally been implemented and deployed within organizational boundaries. Web processes can be viewed as an evolution of workflows, enabling application integration within and across organizational boundaries. Therefore, workflows can be made available as web processes.

Web processes and workflows represent the automation of a business process, in whole or part, during which documents, information, or activities are passed from one participant to another according to a set of rules. They are composed of elements such as transitions, logic conditions, data flows, parallel and conditional building blocks, starting and ending points, splits, and joins. Web processes can be seen as workflows that manage web services instead of tasks (Cardoso and Sheth, 2003), and these workflow management systems can also be used to enact web processes. For example, a web process can be invoked by an outside vendor submitting a request for a price quote. In this scenario, a web process can control the flow of a set of web services that make up an application. The correspondence between web processes and workflows is extremely important because it allows the use of earlier studies, research, and development in the area of workflow management systems to be applied to web processes (Cardoso et al., 2004). The similarity of web processes and workflows allows us to conclude that the path mining technique described in this paper can be applied to both types of processes. Hereafter, we will use the term "process" to refer to both web processes and workflows. We will also use the terminology defined by the WfMC (the Workflow Management Coalition, 2002).

**4.1 Basic Elements of Processes**

A process is composed of activities (web services or tasks) and transitions. Activities are represented using circles, and transitions are represented using arrows. Transitions express dependencies between activities. Activities with more than one outgoing transition can be classified as and-split or xor-split. And-split activities enable all their outgoing transitions after completing their execution, while xor-split activities enable only one outgoing transition. And-split activities are represented with a '•' and xor-split activities with a '⊕'. An activity with more than one incoming transition can be classified as an and-join or xor-join. And-join activities start their execution when all their incoming transitions are enabled, while xor-join activities start their execution when any one of their incoming transitions is enabled.
