## Abstract
This paper investigates the feasibility of key reinstallation attacks in the 4G LTE network. LTE employs session keys for the confidentiality and integrity protection of control-plane signaling packets. However, if these keys are not updated and counters are reset, key reinstallation attacks can occur. We demonstrate that several design choices in the current LTE security setup are vulnerable to such attacks. Specifically, the security association setup procedures on the control plane, which establish security between the device and the network, are disjointed. The keys are installed through one procedure, while their associated parameters (such as uplink and downlink counters) are reset through another. This disjointedness allows an adversary to exploit the security setup procedures and launch key stream reuse attacks. By tricking the victim into using the same key and counter value to encrypt multiple messages, the adversary can break message encryption. This control-plane attack can hijack the location update procedure, rendering the device unreachable from the Internet and potentially deregistering the victim from the LTE network. We have confirmed our findings with two major US operators and found that such attacks can be launched using software-defined radio devices costing around $299. We also propose remedies to defend against these threats.

## 1. Introduction
The fourth-generation (4G) Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology provides billions of users with daily mobile internet access. Unlike wired networks, LTE prioritizes security, employing several built-in mechanisms for authentication, encryption, integrity, and access control. While the encryption and integrity protection components in LTE use well-tested cryptographic algorithms, recent studies on key reinstallation threats in wireless networks [11, 16, 35, 40] suggest that similar vulnerabilities may exist in LTE. Our findings confirm this hypothesis, revealing that the threats are exposed through different procedures and have more severe impacts.

We examine the LTE security key installation method and counter handling processes for various LTE procedures, such as device registration, deregistration, and location updates. 4G, like 3G, uses the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol to install security keys and enable integrity protection for signaling messages. Subsequently, the Security Mode Command procedure activates the ciphering of messages at the LTE subscriber. LTE employs stream ciphers for encryption, which generate a keystream block using a key, counter value, and other inputs. The keystream is then XORed with the plaintext to produce the encrypted message. The security of stream ciphers relies on never reusing the keystream block. If the same keystream block is used to encrypt two different plaintext messages, the encrypted texts can be XORed together to recover the original messages.

In LTE, the scenario where the ciphering algorithm generates the same keystream block over multiple rounds occurs when the ciphering key remains constant and the counter value (responsible for generating random keystream blocks) is reset. We call this "key reinstallation" vulnerability. In this paper, we explore LTE control-plane procedures that lead to key reinstallation attacks.

The idea behind our control-plane attacks is as follows: During the security establishment procedure, the device first installs a new key through the authentication procedure. The network then runs the Security Mode Command procedure to reset the counter values for encryption. If the signaling message is lost or dropped, the network reinitiates the Security Mode Command procedure. When the device receives the replayed Security Mode Command request, it resets the counter values again before generating the response message. This means that two signaling messages sent after two Security Mode Command responses are encrypted with the same keystream block. An attacker can force count resets by blocking the response to the Security Mode Command request, thereby launching attacks on device location updates and deregistration procedures. These attacks can render the victim device unreachable or even leave it without LTE service.

It is important to note that our attacks do not violate the security properties proven in formal LTE analysis, such as LTEInspector [14]. The formal method proofs state that LTE keys should not be shared over the air, and all protocols should behave as specified by the 3GPP standard. Our attacks do not leak ciphering or integrity keys and strictly follow LTE standards. Although the attacker can reset counts, they cannot repeatedly do so for more than one signaling message due to mandatory integrity protection. However, this is sufficient to launch serious attacks, such as deregistering the victim subscriber from the LTE network.

In our experiments, we verified all attack steps with two major US LTE operators using Software Defined Radio (SDR). The results show that LTE key reinstallation attacks are practical and pose a realistic threat to LTE users. Finally, we propose 3GPP standard-compliant remedies to address the discussed vulnerabilities, prototyping our solution and providing its security analysis.

### Ethical Consideration
This work does not raise any ethical or legal concerns. The attacker and victim devices are part of a testbed setup in our lab. We purchased SIM cards from two US operators to conduct our experiments and did not use any other commercial SIM cards to launch attacks towards other LTE subscribers. The purpose of this study is to strengthen LTE security, especially as LTE security mechanisms are considered building blocks for 5G security (e.g., Cellular IoT security).

## 2. Background on LTE and Key Reinstallation

### 2.1 LTE Network and Its Elements
- **LTE Device**: Provides LTE service to end-users. The network assigns a permanent identity (IMSI) and temporary identities (TMSI and RNTI) to each subscriber. TMSI ensures user privacy, while RNTI uniquely identifies an LTE subscriber over the radio interface. The device applies ciphering to both control and data planes, with integrity applied only to the control plane.
- **LTE Base Station**: Acts as a radio interface between the subscriber and the core network, managing radio resources and encrypting user traffic. It uses RNTI to distinguish user traffic and exchanges control-plane radio signaling messages through the RRC protocol.
- **LTE Core Network (EPC)**: Acts as a central entity, providing authentication, mobility management, and internet connectivity. Control-plane signaling messages are exchanged through NAS procedures, including Authentication, Security Mode Command, Attach, Detach, and Tracking Area Update.

### 2.2 Integrity and Confidentiality Procedures in LTE
LTE uses separate algorithms for integrity and ciphering, taking input parameters such as a 128-bit key, a 32-bit count, a 5-bit bearer identity, and a 1-bit direction. The integrity algorithm outputs a MAC, while the ciphering algorithm generates a keystream block. The keystream block is XORed with the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, and vice versa.

### 2.3 Key Reinstallation Attack in Retrospect
Stream ciphers, discovered by Gilbert Vernam in 1917, are popular for encryption. In a stream cipher, the plaintext and key are XORed to produce the ciphertext. To ensure that ciphers do not repeat, the algorithm takes a nonce (count) along with the key. If the key is unchanged and the count repeats, it introduces the two-time pad problem, allowing an adversary to get the encrypted plaintext without knowing the key and count values. Key reinstallation attacks occur when an adversary tricks the victim into reusing count values while keeping the key unchanged, leading to the reuse of the stream cipher and the creation of two-time pads.

In wireless networks, David Wagner and his team first demonstrated stream cipher reuse attacks in WiFi and WSN. Recent studies [8, 10, 40] and Mathy Vanhoef et al. [35] showed that key reuse attacks are still possible in modern WiFi systems, attributed to design or implementation flaws. In contrast, this paper is the first to show that LTE security is vulnerable to key reinstallation attacks, despite the separation of security keys and counts for control-plane and data-plane operations and the splitting of counts into Uplink and Downlink values.

## 3. System Settings and Threat Model

### System Settings
- The attacker controls an LTE device associated with the same operator as the victim.
- Both the attacker and victim are in an area supporting 3G and 4G LTE services.
- The attacker knows the victim's phone number and can dial a CSFB call.
- The victim can receive the call through CSFB or VoLTE.
- Both devices are static during the attack period.

### Threat Model
- The attacker can act as both a passive and active attacker.
- As a passive attacker, they can sniff the radio channel using PDSCH to identify subscribers through C-RNTI.
- As an active attacker, they can modify the contents of messages and use commercial LTE signal sniffers.
- The attacker does not need to act as a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) to forward modified messages.
- To impersonate the victim, the attacker spoofs C-RNTI and TMSI values.
- The attacker can block UL signaling messages by jamming, using techniques like Asynchronous Off-Tone Jamming (AOTJ) to introduce inter-channel interference.
