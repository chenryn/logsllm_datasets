User: I have my server on Google App Engine
One of my jobs is to match a huge set of records with another.
This takes very long, if i have to match 10000 records with 100.
Whats the best way of implementing this.
Im, using Web2py stack and deployed my application on Google App Engine.
Assistant: Multithreading your code is not supported on GAE so you can not explicitly use it.
GAE itself can be multithreaded, which means that one frontend instance can handle multiple http requests simultaneously.
In your case, best way to achieve parallel task execution is Task Queue.
