## Abstract
Cyber attackers often exploit internationalized domain names (IDNs) to create visually similar domain names that mimic legitimate or popular brands. In this work, we systematize such deceptive IDNs and analyze the associated risks. We introduce a new system, DomainScouter, which detects various types of deceptive IDNs and calculates a deceptive IDN score, a metric indicating the number of users likely to be misled by a deceptive IDN. Our comprehensive study, using over 4.4 million registered IDNs under 570 top-level domains (TLDs), reveals previously unexplored deceptive IDNs targeting non-English brands or combining other domain squatting methods. We also conduct online surveys to highlight vulnerabilities in user perceptions when encountering such IDNs. Finally, we discuss practical countermeasures stakeholders can take against deceptive IDNs.

## Introduction
Domain names are essential assets for online service providers. While the Internet was initially designed with English-based domain names, internationalized domain names (IDNs) were introduced to support local languages and scripts. However, cyber attackers abuse IDNs to create visually similar domain names, aiming to deceive users into mistaking these for legitimate brand domains. This type of attack, known as an IDN homograph attack, poses a significant threat. For example, a security researcher demonstrated a phishing attack using an IDN visually similar to apple[.]com, and another used an IDN mimicking adobe[.]com to distribute malware. Recently, a vulnerability in Appleâ€™s Safari browser was reported, which could lead to IDN homograph attacks.

In this paper, we systematize deceptive IDNs, including those targeting both English and non-English brands. We propose DomainScouter, a system that detects deceptive IDNs and calculates a deceptive IDN score. This score indicates the likelihood of users being misled by a deceptive IDN. Our contributions include:
- Proposing DomainScouter to detect various types of deceptive IDNs and calculate a deceptive IDN score.
- Conducting a comprehensive measurement study using over 4.4 million registered IDNs under 570 TLDs.
- Performing online surveys to examine user perceptions and validate the deceptive IDN score.
- Discussing practical countermeasures against deceptive IDNs.

## Systematization of Deceptive IDNs
We categorize all possible deceptive IDNs targeting users' visual perception. These IDNs aim to deceive users into actions such as clicking links in spam emails or entering personal information on phishing sites. We divide deceptive IDNs into those targeting English and non-English brands, as these categories have distinct characteristics. Previous studies have focused primarily on English brands, but non-English brands are increasingly targeted.

We identify three types of deceptive IDNs: combosquatting (combining brand names with keywords), homographs (replacing characters with visually similar ones), and homograph+combosquatting (combining both methods). Our paper extends the concept of combosquatting to IDNs and introduces the first analysis of homograph+combosquatting IDNs.

## DomainScouter System
DomainScouter is designed to detect six types of deceptive IDNs: eng-combo, eng-homo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, noneng-homo, and noneng-homocombo. The system takes registered IDNs and selected brand domains as inputs and outputs detected deceptive IDNs, targeted brands, and deceptive IDN scores. DomainScouter consists of five steps: IDN extraction, brand selection, image generation, feature extraction, and score calculation.

### Step 1: IDN Extraction
We extract existing IDNs from domain registry databases. Since there is no unified database, we collect data from over 1,400 TLD registries. TLDs are categorized into generic (gTLDs) and country-code (ccTLDs), with further subcategories. We use a commercial WHOIS database to gather over 4.4 million IDNs under 570 TLDs.

### Step 2: Brand Selection
We select both English and non-English brand domains. For English brands, we use top domain lists (Alexa, Umbrella, and Majestic) and extract the top 1,000 domains from each, resulting in 2,310 unique domains. For non-English brands, we follow a similar process, collecting 4,774 unique domains.

### Step 3: Image Generation
We generate three types of images for each domain: raw (RAW), public suffix-removed (PSR), and word segmented (WS). RAW images are generated directly from the domain string, PSR images exclude public suffixes, and WS images apply word segmentation algorithms. These images help in calculating visual similarities and detecting different types of deceptive IDNs.

### Step 4: Feature Extraction
We extract features focusing on visual similarities, brand information, and TLD characteristics. Visual similarity features include SSIM indexes between different types of images. Brand features include ranks from top domain lists, and TLD features include the type of TLD.

### Step 5: Score Calculation
We use a machine learning model to calculate the deceptive IDN score, which indicates the number of users likely to be misled by a deceptive IDN. The score is based on the extracted features and helps in identifying and mitigating the risks associated with deceptive IDNs.

## Conclusion
Deceptive IDNs pose a significant threat to Internet users. Our system, DomainScouter, provides a comprehensive approach to detect and score these deceptive IDNs, helping stakeholders implement effective countermeasures. Future work will focus on refining the system and expanding its capabilities to cover more diverse and sophisticated attacks.
