Abstract
Cyber attackers create domain names that are visually sim-
ilar to those of legitimate/popular brands by abusing valid
internationalized domain names (IDNs). In this work, we sys-
tematize such domain names, which we call deceptive IDNs,
and understand the risks associated with them. In particular,
we propose a new system called DomainScouter to detect
various deceptive IDNs and calculate a deceptive IDN score,
a new metric indicating the number of users that are likely to
be misled by a deceptive IDN. We perform a comprehensive
measurement study on the identiﬁed deceptive IDNs using
over 4.4 million registered IDNs under 570 top level domains
(TLDs). The measurement results demonstrate that there are
many previously unexplored deceptive IDNs targeting non-
English brands or combining other domain squatting methods.
Furthermore, we conduct online surveys to examine and high-
light vulnerabilities in user perceptions when encountering
such IDNs. Finally, we discuss the practical countermeasures
that stakeholders can take against deceptive IDNs.
Introduction
1
Domain names are indispensable resources or assets of on-
line service providers on the Internet. Although the Inter-
net was not designed to distinguish borders and languages,
domain names were originally written in English only (i.e.,
using ASCII codes, digits, and hyphens). After some time,
internationalized domain names (IDNs) were proposed to
enable Internet users to create domain names in their local
languages and scripts [25]. Since IDNs were successfully
standardized and implemented in 2003, characters in the Uni-
code Standard can now be used in domain names while main-
taining backward compatibility with previously implemented
English-based domain names and the domain name system
(DNS). The backward compatibility was implemented using
the Punycode representation of the Unicode characters with
a special preﬁx (xn--). For example, 例え[.]test in the
IDN format is transformed into xn-r8jz45g[.]test in the
ASCII-compatible format. IDNs are essential for enabling
the multilingual Internet to serve culturally and linguistically
diverse populations.
At the same time, cyber attackers abuse the IDN mech-
anism to register their domain names for cyber attacks. In
fact, cyber attackers create domain names that are visually
similar to those of legitimate and popular brands by abusing
IDNs [36, 48, 58]. The attackers aim to trick innocent users
into falsely recognizing a purposely created misleading do-
main name as a legitimate brand’s domain name by its visual
appearance. This type of attack, called an IDN homograph
attack, poses a real threat to Internet users. For example, a
security researcher used an IDN similar to apple[.]com with
a valid SSL certiﬁcate to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of
an almost complete phishing attack; many users could not
distinguish the fake IDN from the genuine one by its appear-
ance in April 2017 [68]. Similarly, another security researcher
discovered an IDN homograph attack that used an IDN visu-
ally similar to adobe[.]com to distribute a fake ﬂash player
with malware [40]. Recently, a researcher reported a new vul-
nerability in Apple’s Safari browser that renders a speciﬁc
Unicode letter as a normal Latin small “d” in the browser’s
address bar, which can lead to IDN homograph attacks [56].
In this paper, ﬁrst, we systematize such visually distorted
IDNs, which we call deceptive IDNs, to understand the risks
associated with them. Unlike the previously reported simi-
lar studies [36, 48], the deceptive IDNs in this paper include
not only homograph IDNs, wherein some of the characters
in English brand domain names are replaced with visually
similar characters, but also other types of lookalike IDNs tar-
geting both English and non-English brands comprehensively.
On the basis of the systematization, we propose a new sys-
tem called DOMAINSCOUTER for detecting deceptive IDNs
and calculating a deceptive IDN score for each IDN. This
score is a new metric indicating the number of users that are
likely to be misled by a deceptive IDN. The purpose of DO-
MAINSCOUTER is to score the suspiciousness of an attempt to
deceive users on the basis of IDN characteristics. In particular,
it is designed to capture distinctive visual characteristics of
deceptive IDNs, consider characteristics of targeted legitimate

IDNs and targeted domain names.
The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows.
• Propose a new system called DOMAINSCOUTER to de-
tect more various types of deceptive IDNs than previ-
ously proposed systems and calculate a deceptive IDN
score, a new metric indicating the number of users likely
to be misled by a deceptive IDN (Sections 3 and 4).
• Perform by far the most comprehensive measurement
study on the deceptive IDNs detected by the proposed
DOMAINSCOUTER using over 4.4 million registered
real-world IDNs under 570 top level domains (TLDs)
(Section 5).
• Conduct online surveys (N=838) to examine vulnerabil-
ities in user perceptions when encountering deceptive
IDNs and evaluate that the deceptive IDN score we pro-
posed reﬂects the tendency of users to be deceived by
the attacks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
user study on deceptive IDNs (Section 6).
• Discuss the practical countermeasures that stakeholders
can take against deceptive IDNs (Section 7).
2 Systematization of Deceptive IDNs
We systematize all possible deceptive IDNs targeting users’
visual perception. We focus on IDNs that look similar to those
of legitimate brands to deceive users to take actions such as
clicking links in spam emails and inputting personal infor-
mation on phishing sites. To the best of our knowledge, this
study is the ﬁrst attempt in security research to systematize
deceptive IDNs.
First, we divide deceptive IDNs into those targeting English
brands and those targeting non-English brands since these two
categories have quite different characteristics. Since English is
the world’s standard language and the Internet was originally
available only in ASCII and English character sets, most glob-
ally popular brands have their websites and domain names in
English. At the same time, many local brands in non-English-
speaking communities have started to use their native lan-
guages and characters to create domain names. Thus, English
and non-English brand names should be treated differently, es-
pecially when researching the Internet-related topics such as
domain names. Whereas previous studies have focused only
on deceptive IDNs targeting English brands [36, 48], IDNs
targeting non-English brands have not been studied well so
far.
Second, we reveal that there are three types of deceptive
IDNs in theory: combosquatting (combining brand name
with keywords) (combo), homograph (homo), and homo-
graph+combosquatting (homocombo) IDNs. We deﬁne a
combo IDN as an IDN that combines a brand domain name
with some additional English or non-English phrases. Kintis
et al. [30] conducted the ﬁrst study to reveal English-based
combosquatting domains; our paper extends this concept to
IDNs. The homo IDN is an IDN wherein some of the charac-
ters of a brand domain name are replaced with characters that
are visually similar. Some previous studies analyzed the char-
acteristics of homo IDNs in 2018 [36, 48]. The homocombo
IDN is deﬁned as an IDN that does not match the above
combo or homo deﬁnitions exactly but has characteristics
of both the combo and homo IDNs; e.g., an IDN containing
words similar to a legitimate brand name and some additional
phrases. Our paper is the ﬁrst to deﬁne, measure, and analyze
the homocombo IDNs. Note that we do not include any non-
IDN squatting domains such as typosquatting (typographical
errors) [1, 29, 55, 62] or bitsquatting (accidental bit ﬂips) [41]
since our paper focuses on user misbehavior caused by decep-
tive IDNs.
On the basis of the above conditions, we consider six
types of IDN-based attacks in this paper. In particular, when
considering English brands (e.g., example[.]test) as tar-
gets, the brand could be targeted by combo IDNs (eng-
combo; e.g., exampleログイン[.]test), homo IDNs (eng-
homo; e.g., êxämpl¯e[.]test), and homocombo IDNs (eng-
homocombo; e.g., êxämpl¯eログイン[.]test). When con-
sidering non-English brands (e.g., 例え[.]test), the brand
could be targeted by combo IDNs (noneng-combo; e.g., 例
えログイン[.]test), homo IDNs (noneng-homo; e.g., ｲ列
え[.]test), and homocombo IDNs (noneng-homocombo;
e.g., ｲ列えログイン[.]test).
In terms of creating/registering deceptive IDNs (especially
combo and homocombo), attackers are free to use one or
more arbitrary words as preﬁxes or postﬁxes of brands. That
is, similar to non-IDN combosquatting [30], a deceptive IDN
lacks a generative model. Therefore, we cannot rely on the
generative model but need to design a system to grasp the
nature of deceptive IDNs.
3 DomainScouter System
We propose a new system called DOMAINSCOUTER to
detect the six types of deceptive IDNs (eng-combo, eng-
homo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, noneng-homo, and
noneng-homocombo) deﬁned in Section 2. Figure 1 shows
an overview of DOMAINSCOUTER. The inputs to DOMAIN-
SCOUTER are registered IDNs and selected brand domains.
DOMAINSCOUTER automatically detects deceptive IDNs on
the basis of various features focusing on visual similarities,
brand information, and TLD characteristics. The outputs of
DOMAINSCOUTER are detected deceptive IDNs, targeted
brands, and deceptive IDN scores for each IDN. The decep-
tive IDN score is a new metric indicating the number of users
likely to be deceived when encountering a deceptive IDN. DO-
MAINSCOUTER consists of ﬁve steps: IDN extraction, brand
selection, image generation, feature extraction, and score cal-
culation. The following sections explain these steps in turn.

3.1 Step 1: IDN Extraction
The ﬁrst step involves extracting already existing IDNs from
the domain registry databases. Unfortunately, since each do-
main registry corresponding to a TLD has been operated
separately, there is no single (uniﬁed) database with all regis-
tered domains freely available for researchers. Thus, we need
to collect registered domain names from more than 1,400
TLD registries to study all IDNs that exist in the world.
In general, TLDs can be divided into two cate-
gories: generic TLDs (gTLDs) and country-code TLDs
(ccTLDs) [21]. In this paper, we further separate gTLDs
and ccTLDs to understand the relationship between decep-
tive IDNs and TLDs’ characteristics. We separate gTLDs
into three types: legacy gTLD, new gTLD, and new IDN
gTLD. The legacy gTLD consists of 22 TLDs (.aero,
.asia, .biz, .cat, .com, .coop, .edu, .gov, .info, .int,
.jobs, .mil, .mobi, .museum, .name, .net, .org, .post,
.pro, .tel, .travel, and .xxx) introduced before the new
gTLD program started by ICANN in 2013 [24, 31]. The
new gTLD is composed of 1,042 non-IDN TLDs (e.g.,
.top, .xyz, and .loan) introduced by the ICANN’s pro-
gram. The new IDN gTLD is made up of 84 IDN TLDs
(e.g., .网址 (.xn-ses554g), .在线 (.xn-3ds443g), and
.рус (.xn-p1acf)) also used by the program, especially
for allowing the entire domain names to be represented in
a local language and characters. Furthermore, we separate
ccTLDs into two types: legacy ccTLD and new IDN ccTLD.
The legacy ccTLD is composed of 245 TLDs (e.g., .cn, .jp,
and .uk) that were two-letter codes representing countries
listed by the ISO 3166-1 standard [23]. The new IDN ccTLD
consists of 42 IDN TLDs (e.g., .新加坡 (.xn-yfro4i67o),
.ј҉ьt (.xn-3e0b707e), and .рф (.xn-p1ai)) registered
after 2009 [22].
To collect and extract all registered IDNs under the above-
mentioned TLD types, we leveraged the commercial WHOIS
database [64] containing information about nearly all domains
as of May 2018. Table 1 shows the breakdown of our collected
dataset. In total, we processed over 294 million domains (in-
cluding IDNs and non-IDNs) under 1,435 TLDs. From all
domains, we extracted over 4.4 million IDNs under 570 TLDs.
Note that the remaining 865 TLDs have no registered IDNs.
3.2 Step 2: Brand Selection
The second step of DOMAINSCOUTER is selecting brand
domains targeted by deceptive IDNs. We need to select both

English and non-English brands since our paper focuses on
deceptive IDNs targeting both types of brands as stated in
Section 2.
For English brands, we leveraged three major top domain
lists (Alexa [2], Umbrella [11], and Majestic [38] top 1 mil-
lion lists) that record representative Internet domains. As
discussed in recent studies [35, 50], each list has its own rank-
ing mechanism; thus, we used the three major lists in the
Internet measurement community to collect English brands
in an unbiased way. We extracted the top 1,000 domains from
each list, removed redundant domains, and ﬁnally collected
2,310 domains in total.
For non-English brands, we used the same three top do-
main lists as for English brands. Since there are far fewer
non-English brand domains than English ones, we extracted
non-English IDNs from the top 1 million domains in each
list, removed redundant domains, and ﬁnally collected 4,774
domains in total. Note that we excluded some low-ranked
malicious domains accidentally listed in the top lists by re-
ferring to multiple domain blacklists such as VirusTotal [61],
hpHosts [20], Google Safe Browsing [16], and Symantec
DeepSight [54].
3.3 Step 3: Image Generation
The third step of DOMAINSCOUTER is generating images
from both registered IDNs (step 1) and brand domains (step
2) for the following calculation of visual similarities in step
4. In particular, we generate three types of images for each
domain in both registered IDNs and brand domains. We select
the default font used in the address bar of Google Chrome
in Windows 10 since the browser/OS has the biggest market
share [52].
RAW images. The ﬁrst type is a raw image, simply generated
from each domain’s string without any modiﬁcations. RAW is
used for specifying a very similar combination of a deceptive
IDN (e.g., eng-homo and noneng-homo) and a brand domain
as a whole.
PSR images. The second type is a public sufﬁx-removed
(PSR) image generated from substrings excluding a public
sufﬁx [39] from a domain name string. A public sufﬁx con-
sists of strings in domain names that cannot be controlled by
individual Internet users [9]. For example, in the case of PSR
images, example is extracted from both example[.]com and
example[.]co[.]jp since .com and .co.jp are in public
sufﬁxes. PSR images can help distinguish deceptive IDNs that
have different public sufﬁxes from targeted brand domains

since attackers do not necessarily use the same public sufﬁxes
of the brand domains [48].
WS images. The third type is a word segmented (WS) image.
A WS image is generated by applying word segmentation
algorithms to a domain name string. For example, example
and テスト are segmented from exampleテスト[.]com. We
use the polyglot [44] implementation for multilingual word
segmentation. The intuition behind generating WS images is
to help detect combosquatting-based deceptive IDNs such as
eng-combo, eng-homocombo, noneng-combo, and noneng-
