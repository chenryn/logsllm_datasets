"Waypoint: Use jQuery to Modify the Entire Page" not accepting solution
statement (below), even though performing function in mobile emulator. Per
'Report a Bug' page, attempted the following:
  * Hard Refresh by clearing cache
  * Logging out and back in
  * Searching for solution online (https://github.com/ATSlade/FCC-Workspace/wiki/jQuery)
  * Asked in Chat / Gitter. Issue was confirmed by user @phoenixlaef shortly before this report at 23:10 on 11/30/15.
Statement Solutions Used:  
$("body").addClass("animated hinge");  
$("body").addClass("animated hinge")  
$('body').addClass('animated hinge');
Will move on to JavaScript waypoints tomorrow, but would like to come back and
complete this. Thanks!
