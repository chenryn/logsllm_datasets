Abstract—EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card
payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation.
Known to bank customers as “Chip and PIN”, it is used in
Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure
from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures
credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the
card and the customer presenting it through a combination of
cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the
entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a
protocol ﬂaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card
to make a payment without knowing the card’s PIN, and
to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online
connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a
man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing
the PIN veriﬁed correctly, while telling the card that no PIN
was entered at all. The paper considers how the ﬂaws arose,
why they remained unknown despite EMV’s wide deployment
for the best part of a decade, and how they might be ﬁxed.
Because we have found and validated a practical attack against
the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol
is broken. This failure is signiﬁcant in the ﬁeld of protocol
design, and also has important public policy implications,
in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards.
Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting
that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and
concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying.
Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes
the need for further research to bridge the gap between the
theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. It
also demonstrates the need for the next version of EMV to be
engineered properly.

I. INTRODUCTION
Smart cards have gradually replaced magnetic strip cards
for point-of-sale and ATM transactions in many countries.
The leading system, EMV [1], [2], [3], [4] (named after
Europay, MasterCard, and Visa), has been deployed through-
out most of Europe, and is currently being rolled out in
Canada. As of early 2008, there were over 730 million EMV-
compliant smart cards in circulation worldwide [5]. In EMV,
customers authorize a credit or debit card transaction by
inserting their card and entering a PIN into a point-of-sale
terminal; the PIN is typically veriﬁed by the smart card chip,
which is in turn authenticated to the terminal by a digital
certiﬁcate. The transaction details are also authenticated by
a cryptographic message authentication code (MAC), using

Figure 1. Fraud statistics on UK-issued cards [6]
a symmetric key shared between the payment card and the
bank that issued the card to the customer (the issuer).
EMV was heavily promoted under the “Chip and PIN”
brand during its national rollout in the UK. The technology
was advertised as a solution to increasing card fraud: a chip
to prevent card counterfeiting, and a PIN to prevent abuse
of stolen cards. Since its introduction in the UK the fraud
landscape has changed signiﬁcantly: lost and stolen card
fraud is down, and counterfeit card fraud experienced a two
year lull. But no type of fraud has been eliminated, and the
overall fraud levels have actually risen (see Figure 1). The
likely explanation for this is that EMV has simply moved
fraud, not eliminated it.
in that
One goal of EMV was to externalise the costs of dispute
from the issuing bank,
if a disputed transaction
has been authorised by a manuscript signature, it would be
charged to the merchant, while if it had been authorised by a
PIN then it would be charged to the customer. The net effect
is that the banking industry, which was responsible for the
design of the system, carries less liability for the fraud. The
industry describes this as a ‘liability shift’.
Security economics teaches us that such arrangements
create “moral hazard,” by insulating banks from the risk
of their poor system design, so it is no surprise when such
plans go awry. Several papers have documented technical
attacks on EMV. However, it is now so deeply entrenched
that changes can be very hard to make. Fundamental pro-
tocol changes may now require mutual agreement between
banks, merchants, point-of-sale hardware manufacturers, and
international card schemes (Visa, MasterCard, and American
Express), all of which lobby hard to protect their interests.
As with the Internet communications protocols, we are stuck
with suboptimal design decisions made a decade ago. So
few system changes have been made, and meanwhile the
volume of customer complaints about disputed transactions
continues to rise. A June 2009 survey revealed that one in
ﬁve UK victims of fraud are left out of pocket [7].
In the past few years, the UK media have reported numer-
ous cases where cardholders’ complaints have been rejected
by their bank and by government-approved mediators such
as the Financial Ombudsman Service, using stock excuses
such as ‘Your card was CHIP read and a PIN was used so
you must have been negligent.’ Interestingly, an increasing
number of complaints from believable witnesses indicate that
their EMV cards were fraudulently used shortly after being
stolen, despite there having been no possibility that the thief
could have learned the PIN.
In this paper, we describe a potential explanation. We have
demonstrated how criminals can use stolen “Chip and PIN”
(EMV) smart cards without knowing the PIN. Since “veriﬁed
by PIN” – the essence of the system – does not work, we
declare the Chip and PIN system to be broken.
II. PROTOCOL FAILURE
EMV is both a protocol suite and a proprietary protocol
framework: a general toolkit from which protocols can be
built. In practice, it works as follows. A bank that issues
EMV cards selects a subset of the EMV protocols, choosing
for instance between digital signature methods, selecting a
MAC algorithm, and deciding on hundreds of customisable
options regarding authentication and risk management. Their
selection must comply with card scheme rules as well as the
EMV framework. Meanwhile merchants and acquiring banks
(who receive payments on behalf of merchants) simply
procure EMV-compliant hardware and software and connect
it to the payment networks (operated by card schemes).
Since we cannot enumerate the many possible protocols,
we mainly describe the protocol as it is deployed within
the UK. However, it is implemented similarly in many other
countries. In particular, the attack we introduce in this paper
results both from a protocol failure of the EMV framework,
and a failure of the proprietary MAC protocols that are used
by issuing banks (and approved by the card schemes).
As Figure 2 shows in detail, the EMV protocol can be
split into three phases:
Card authentication:
Assures the terminal which bank issued the card,
and that the card data have not been altered
Cardholder veriﬁcation:
Assures the terminal that the PIN entered by the
customer matches the one for this card
Transaction authorization:
Assures the terminal that the bank which issued
the card authorizes the transaction
1) Card authentication: EMV smart cards may contain
multiple separate applications with different cryptographic
keys, such as a debit or credit card for use at shops,
ATM functionality, and MasterCard Chip Authentication
Programme (CAP) applications for online banking. Thus
when a card is inserted into a point of sale terminal, the
terminal ﬁrst requests a list of supported applications (by
reading the ﬁle “1PAY.SYS.DDF01”) and selects one of
them. The actual transaction is then initiated by sending the
Get Processing Options command to the card.
Next, the terminal reads cardholder information from the
card by sending a Read Record command with the appro-
priate ﬁle identiﬁers. These records include card details (e.g.
primary account number, start and expiry date), backwards
compatibility data (e.g. a copy of the magnetic strip), and
control parameters for the protocol (e.g.
the cardholder
veriﬁcation method list, and card data object lists, which
will be discussed later).
The records also include an RSA digital signature over a
subset of the records, together with a certiﬁcate chain linking
the signing key to a card scheme root key known to the
terminal. In one variant of EMV, known as SDA (static data
authentication), the card itself is not capable of performing
RSA operations, so it can only present the terminal with a
static certiﬁcate. Cards employing the DDA (dynamic data
authentication) variant additionally contain RSA private keys
which are used to sign a nonce sent by the terminal and
whose corresponding public keys are authenticated by the
certiﬁcate chain.
SDA cards (which prior to 2009 all UK banks issued) are
vulnerable to a trivial and well-known replay attack in which
the certiﬁcate is read from a card and written to a counterfeit
one (these are often called “yes cards” because they will
respond “yes” to a PIN veriﬁcation request, no matter what
PIN is entered). The card is then used at a point-of-sale
terminal which has no online connection to the banking
network, and because there is no real-time interaction, the
MAC produced during transaction authorization cannot be
checked before the goods are handed over.
However, the vast majority of UK point-of-sale terminals
maintain a permanent online connection, so yes cards could
normally be detected1. Since 2009, some UK banks have
started issuing DDA cards, which resist counterfeiting even
in ofﬂine transactions, by giving the cards the capability to
sign a terminal-provided nonce under an asymmetric key.
However the attack presented in this paper does not rely
on the yes card attack; it is entirely independent of card
authentication, whether by SDA or DDA.
1There are viable criminal attack scenarios involving yes cards, and
criminal business models, but these are beyond the scope of this paper.
