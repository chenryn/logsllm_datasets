Question: A financial web application uses hidden fields to store state information between client and server interactions. An attacker discovers that by modifying the hidden fields related to transaction IDs, they can re-submit transactions and bypass server-side checks, leading to unauthorized fund transfers. Which of the following best represents a vulnerability that the attacker is exploiting?
"A": "Weak encryption of transaction data allowing easy decryption by the attacker.",
"B": "Insufficient server-side validation of transaction state leading to replay attacks.",
"C": "Overly permissive cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) policy.",
"D": "Insecure direct object references resulting in unauthorized data access."
Answer: B
