the minimum physical port capacity offered by that IXP. For some
IXPs (see Fig. 10a), such as France-IX, which cooperates with more
than 20 resellers [10], 40% of the inferences can be made by using
only port capacity information. However, for other IXPs that do
not allow port reselling (e.g., HKIX), this step fails to make any
inference. On average, this step contributes for approx. 10% of the
total inferences (see column COV in Table 4).
Step 2. We then execute a ping measurement campaign between 7-
9 Apr. 2018 from each LG and Atlas VP, to the peering interfaces of
the IXP that hosts the VP. LGs achieve high response rates (Fig. 9a)
due to being directly attached to the IXP peering LAN. In contrast,
50 of the 66 Atlas probes are colocated within an IXP facility, but
are not inside the IXP’s LAN. Therefore, pings from them to IXP
LAN IP addresses are more likely to fail for various reasons [62].
14 of the Atlas probes do not receive any ping response.
Figure 9b shows the RTTmin distributions between VPs (LGs and
Atlas probes) and IXP interfaces. 75% of the IXP interfaces are within
2ms from the respective VP. More than 20% of the interfaces
have RTTmin > 10ms, a 2-fold increase since 2014 [35, 36].
However, we found Atlas probes with consistently inflated RTT
values9. Such probes may be deployed in the IXP’s management
LAN which may not be in the IXP’s facilities, but still abide to the
TTL match filter (see Section 4) which is set to TT Lmax − 1 for
Atlas probes. Thus, we discard probes that have RTTmin ≥ 1ms
between the probe and the IXP’s route server. This filter removes
another 21 Atlas probes from the set of usable VPs. Also, note
that a large number of minimum RTTs obtained from LGs are
exactly 1ms, which happens because many LGs round up the RTT
value to the nearest integer. For such LGs we calculate the dmin
distance between the IXP interface and the VP assuming RTT ′
=
RTTmin − 1, and we use the rounded-up RTTmin to calculate the
corresponding dmax distance.
Table 5 provides the statistics of the queried interfaces that were
used for our inferences after filtering out the unusable VPs.
Step 3. We calculate the feasible IXP and AS facilities for each
peering interface, based on the measured RTTmin, and infer the
interfaces as local, remote or unknown, based on the combined
latency and colocation information. Figure 9c shows the RTTmin
for each IXP interface versus the number of feasible facilities. Each
(RTTmin, #f acilities) data point is tagged with its inferred peer-
ing type. 94% of the remote interfaces have no feasible com-
mon facility with the IXP (which further validates the coloca-
tion “principle”), while for 6% we have at least one feasible facility.
Drilling down on this 6%, 40% of the involved interfaces exhibit
RTTmin > 2ms, indicating spurious colocation information. More-
over, 5% of them are in a facility within the same metro area as
the IXP VP but not affiliated with the IXP, while the rest are cases
of IXP members colocated with the IXP but connecting through a
reseller via a low-capacity virtual port (inferred at Step 1).
Step 4. For the unknown interfaces of Step 3, we investigate if
they are part of multi-IXP routers. Figure 9d shows the number
(per inferred type) of IXP routers compared to the number of IXPs
with which they are connected (next-hop IXPs). Surprisingly, we
find that 20% of the unknown interfaces and ∼80% of the corre-
sponding routers have multiple IXP connections, with 25%
of them connecting to more than 10 IXPs. This result high-
lights that the AS-level and IXP-level peering diversity of such
IXP peers are misleading indicators of their resilience, since all of
their interconnections depend on the same physical equip-
ment (i.e., the multi-IXP router). We further observe that cases of
remote multi-IXP routers are more prevalent than hybrid ones.
Step 5. Finally, for the remaining unknown interfaces we infer
locality or remoteness based on their private connectivity. As shown
in Fig. 10a, we had to apply this heuristic only for 11 of the top 30
IXPs, because previous steps did not manage to successfully infer
some of the IXP interfaces of these IXPs as remote or local.
Overall. In total, the contribution (in terms of fraction of inferences)
of each step of the methodology is shown in Fig. 10a. Steps 2 (RTT +
colo) and 3 (multi-IXP routers) account for the majority of the

inferences. Moreover, Fig. 10b shows the final inference results for
the top 30 IXPs. Overall, we find 28% of all the IXP interfaces
for which we made an inference to be remote. Also, for 90%
of the IXPs, it holds that more than 10% of their members
are remote peers. Finally, we find that for the two largest IXPs
(DE-CIX and AMS-IX) almost 40% of their members are remote.
6.2 Features of Remote Peers
Having inferred remote and local peers per IXP, we proceed to inves-
tigate what are the features of remote peers and if/how they differen-
tiate from local peers. We examine 3 features for each IXP member:
(i) the size of its customer cone, as reported by CAIDA [5], (ii) its
traffic levels and countries of presence as reported by PDB [16],
and (iii) the user population it serves, as reported by APNIC [28].
We classify an IXP member network as follows: “remote” if it has
only remote connections; “local” if it has only local connections;
“hybrid” if it has both types (in the same or multiple IXPs). Out of
2959 total inferred AS-peers in 30 IXPs, we find that 63.7% are local,
23.4% are remote and 12.9% are hybrid.
In Fig. 11a we show the fractions of remote, local and hybrid
IXP members with respect to the size of their customer cone. We
observe that remote peers (red line) have quite similar patterns
with the local ones (blue line). In fact, whether a network chooses
to engage in local or remote peering (which is a matter of network
design) at an IXP is not reflected on the size of its customer cone.
This is probably due to the fact that both practices achieve similar
Internet reachability to/from the local/remote peer’s customers. In-
terestingly enough, member ASes that are local peers in some IXPs
and remote in others tend to have one order of magnitude larger
customer cones than the other cases. This is because hybrid IXP
members are usually large ISPs that have diverse peering policies
over large geographical areas, engaging both in local and remote
peering depending on their business needs per market segment.
Note that the insights pertaining to the customer cones of local,
remote and hybrid peers are also reflected in the estimated user
populations by APNIC, as expected (results omitted for brevity).
Regarding the country distribution of the IXP members, we found
that most local (13.86%) and hybrid (11.04%) peers are headquartered
in GB, while PL seems to host the most remote peers (12.88%).
With respect to the traffic levels associated with each network10,
as shown in Fig. 11b, the observed pattern seems to comply with
the insights related to the cones and user populations of the IXP
members. The distributions of the traffic levels for remote and
local peers are similar (albeit with the fraction of local peers per
traffic level being larger as expected), while hybrid peers seem to
be present also at very high traffic levels, together with locals. It
is also interesting that networks with vastly different traffic levels
(ranging from 100s of Mbits to 100s of Gbits) engage in RP practices.
6.3 RP Evolution
To understand aspects of the evolution of RP over time, we collect
(i) daily RTT measurements (pings) from available LG VPs in 5
IXPs (LINX, HKIX, LONAP, THINX and UAIX), (ii) PDB dumps,
and (iii) Atlas traceroutes between 2017/07/04 - 2018/09/10, and we
use them to infer remote and local peers across time. Based on this
information, we can calculate aggregate growth (i.e., a new member
joins an IXP) and departure (i.e., an old member leaves an IXP) rates
per peering type. We observe that the number of remote peers
grows twice as fast as the number of local peers, indicating
that today, remote peers are the primary drivers of IXP growth
(Fig. 12a). These results are confirmed by IXP annual reports from
some of the largest IXPs (AMS-IX, DE-CIX, France-IX) [27, 42, 44],
indicating that IXPs that already service the majority of local net-
works in their respective country-level peering ecosystems, seek
to expand their market pool by attracting remote peers. However,
remote peers also exhibit higher (+25%) departure rates than local
ones; reseller customers do not commit substantial resources to
establish their IXP connectivity (e.g., routing equipment at the IXP),
therefore it might be easier for them to terminate it. For the same
time period we also found 18 cases of peers that switched from
remote to local interconnections.
6.4 RP Routing Implications
Here, as another use case demonstrating the applicability of our
inference methodology, we investigate the interplay between re-
mote peering and Internet routing. Specifically, we consider the
DE-CIX Frankfurt (FRA) IXP, and examine the routing behavior
between its 314 remote members (as inferred by our methodology)
10In Figure 11b, we refer to the aggregate –self-reported via PeeringDB– traffic levels
exchanged by the network themselves and not their peering connections.

and any other of its 781 (local or remote) members (available at
the time of measurement). Let ASR be a remote member of DE-
CIX FRA, and ASx another DE-CIX FRA member (remote or local;
ASR (cid:44) ASx ), which peers in at least one more common IXP with
ASR. We are interested in circuitous paths that start at ASR and end
at ASx , which we find with the following process. (i) We randomly
choose maximum 5 available (up and running) RIPE Atlas probes
within ASR. (ii) We extract the routed prefixes that ASx advertises
via BGP, using the RIPEstat service [20]. (iii) We select the first
IP address (.1) of a randomly chosen prefix among these prefixes.
(iv) We run traceroutes from the chosen probes in ASR towards
the selected IP address of ASx . (v) We extract all traceroute paths
involving an IXP crossing (see Section 3.3), either over DE-CIX FRA
or another common IXP.
We analyze the results for all possible {ASR, ASx } pairs (∼ 245k in
total). We identify 5941 IXP crossings involving ASR and ASx as
the two peering IXP members. As described above, these crossings
involve either DE-CIX FRA or another IXP where both ASes peer.
ASR and ASx are also the source and destination of the traceroute(s),
respectively. In the majority of the cases (66%), we observe that
the routing decision of ASR seems to comply with an expected hot-
potato exit strategy [31, 74], i.e., the IXP involved in the crossing is
the closest one to ASR among the IXPs where both ASR and ASx
are present. Interestingly enough, on the one hand, we identify
cases (18%) where traffic is exchanged via the RP interconnection of
ASR at DE-CIX FRA, while there exists another common IXP that is
closer to ASR. By using this closer IXP, instead of the RP in DE-CIX
FRA, ASR could offload traffic 100s of km closer to its network.
On the other hand, there are cases (16%) where the two peers use
another (local or remote) peering link (i.e., not over DE-CIX FRA)
to exchange traffic, while the facilities of DE-CIX FRA are closer
to the ASR. In the latter cases, ASR could use the RP over DE-CIX
FRA to offload traffic hundreds of km closer to its network.
The reason why in some cases these networks do not make
a “seemingly better” (latency-wise) routing decision has to do
with their own policies, which are not typically known. Note also
that both routing options (over remote peering in DE-CIX or lo-
cal/remote peering in another IXP), are over peer-to-peer links via
IXPs. Therefore, we cannot distinguish routing preferences based
on coarse AS-relationships [60] (customer vs. peer vs. provider);

this would require taking into account also additional features, such
as BGP communities [47], which is the subject of future work.
7 DISCUSSION & INSIGHTS
Ubiquity and growth. We found that RP becomes an increasingly
popular practice and is almost ubiquitous in the global IXP ecosys-
tem (Fig. 10b). For instance, in AMS-IX, 90% of new customers come
through reseller programs [23]. Exceptions are IXPs that do not
support port reselling, but even they facilitate RP for physically
distant members, e.g., over L2 carriers. It is worth mentioning that
in the past, one of the reasons why local IXP traffic remained local,
was because distance meant cost. In light of significantly reduced
transport costs, that is no longer the case. Indeed, the largest IXPs
have more distant members compared to the average. This is an
example of a network effect; the more members an IXP has, the
more valuable that IXP is to networks [68]. We observe that most
new members at the largest IXPs are remote (Fig. 12a). Interestingly,
even smaller IXPs exhibit growing tendencies in terms of RP.
Implications. There are RP cases that have a clear impact on rout-
ing paths, and thus, on performance and resiliency. We find evidence
that RPs support suboptimal routing choices and introduce latency
penalties (Section 6.4). In fact, in many cases, exchanging traffic at
an IXP where both traffic source and destination are colocated as
members, would be more beneficial for performance (e.g., lower la-
tency; Fig. 1b). For ASes with a global footprint the lack of visibility
in whether a peer is local or remote makes their traffic engineer-
ing considerably harder. In particular, anycast routing employed
by CDNs is affected by RP practices that drive traffic away from
the intended load-balancing center, i.e., the IXP itself. In contrast,
we also find cases where RP can improve performance by offering
better routing choices to a broader set of networks (Section 6.4).
In terms of resilience, there are potential issues with RP setups.
While an extensive investigation of these issues is the subject of
future work, here we reason about some obvious resilience implica-
tions. Multiple peers connect via the same reseller’s physical port to
