2. As data for the ranking we use 1,000 vaults, where one
“real vault” is chosen from PBVault and 999 “decoy
vaults” are chosen from a list of decoy vaults, obtained
by repeatedly decrypting a NoCrack vault with the
wrong master password and querying it for the pass-
words for a speciﬁc number of login domains. Decoy
vaults are chosen to have the same size as the real
vault. Note that this list is disjoint from the list used
for approximating ˆPdecoy.
DKL( ˆPcvi (cid:107) ˆPdecoy ).
3. The ranking is performed using KL divergence
4. This experiment is repeated 100 times for each vault in
PBVault, choosing fresh decoy vaults in each iteration.
Results.
The results of this experiment are summarized in Table 1.
They show that the real vault cvreal is ranked on average
among the 6.20 % of the most likely vaults, thus reducing the
amount of online guessing by approximately a factor of 16.
This is signiﬁcantly better than the best reported attack by
Chatterjee et al. using machine learning [9], which reported
an average rank for the combined feature vector of 39.70 %.
The situation is, however, even worse when we take a closer
look at how the ranks of the real vaults are distributed. In
fact, this distribution is skewed to the right, with a median
of only 1.97 % and a 1st Quartile of 1.02 %. This means
that half the vaults are among the top-ranked 1.97 % of the
vaults, reducing the amount of online guessing by a factor
of 50, and 25 % of the vaults are ranked among the top
1.02 %, reducing the amount of online guessing by a factor
of 98. Note that we provide an attack against NoCrack tak-
ing into account further information in Section 5.4, which
brings down the average rank to 2.43 % and the 1st Quar-
tile to 0.56 %. For comparability, we also report the results
separated by vault sizes, see Table 1 (left). The results vary
little with the vault sizes, mainly the mean gets smaller for
larger vault sizes, most likely as there is more data available
for the comparison.
Inﬂuence of the Size of the Training Set.
In order to determine the inﬂuence of the number of sam-
ples for approximating the decoy distribution, we ran the
experiment with varying numbers of samples. The results
are summarized in Table 1 (right). As expected, more sam-
ples provide better results, while the improvements are get-
ting less pronounced beyond 10 million samples. Note that
this depends on the NLE used and we have found diﬀerent
behavior for the NLE based on Markov models, which we
introduce in Section 6.
Furthermore, while a KDF, which is computationally ex-
pensive to evaluate, will slow down the trial decryptions, it
cannot eﬀectively slow down sampling of the decoy distribu-
tion. Instead, the NLE can be queried directly by providing
a random bit string S as input for the NLE (cf. Figure 1).
4.4 Experiments for Single Passwords:
NoCrack MPW vs. Password Leaks
The previous experiments have demonstrated that there
is a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the distribution of passwords
sampled from NoCrack and from the PBVault leak and that
the KL divergence is a suitable tool to distinguish the two.
We strive to better understand how (dis-)similar password
lists are, and how well the KL divergence can perform to
accurately distinguish them.
All available password lists we are aware of, with the
exception of the PBVault, contain single passwords only.
Therefore, we sample one single random password from a
number of NoCrack (SG) vaults to obtain independent pass-
word samples. This approach produces artiﬁcial vaults, con-
taining not related but independent passwords, like NoC-
rack (MPW), that can be meaningfully compared with other
artiﬁcial vaults built from single-passwords-only password
lists.
Setup.
In this experiment we perform a pairwise comparison be-
tween two password lists. We denote one list as “real pass-
word list” R, the other as “decoy password list” D.
1. The decoy list D is split into two (disjoint) parts Dv
and Dref , where Dv is used for picking decoy vaults,
and Dref is used as an approximation for the reference
distribution. As some lists (e. g., MySpace) are quite
small, we repeatedly split D for each new vault.
2. We pick one “real” vault of size 10 from the set R, where
we select the individual passwords independently of
each other. We pick 999 “decoy” vaults of size 10 from
Dv, again with independent passwords.
3. When computing the KL divergence, we use the set
Dref to obtain the reference distribution (which is dis-
joint from Dv).

we also report numbers for the static Markov NLE, which is introduced in Section 6.

5. CRACKING NOCRACK
We have seen a ﬁrst criterion (the KL divergence) for dis-
tinguishing between vaults drawn according to the decoy
distribution. Next, we will consider several more criteria
that are based on structural diﬀerences of the vault.
5.1 Correlation and Dependence
As already mentioned, but not examined by Bojinov et
al. [3] and Chatterjee et al. [9], additional data that in-
ﬂuences the human password-choice [33] might be helpful
in determining the real vault. In fact, research has shown
that background information about the user helps to guess
passwords [6, 24] and to answer personal knowledge ques-
tions [26, 28]. We evaluated this assumption by using the
available usernames or email addresses from PBVault to
measure the eﬀect on the ranking success. We considered
an overlap between the username and password as an indi-
cator for the vault being real, but preliminary experiments
have shown that this is a weak indicator only. Therefore, we
give this factor a small weight compared to the KL diver-
gence, thus it basically resolves ties between two vaults with
the same KL divergence. We converted both, the username
and the password to lowercase and reverted some leetspeak
transformations. If the (transformed) username was a sub-
string of the password, we gave a score of 2;
if the edit
distance was below a threshold, we gave a score of 1.
Results from this experiment are summarized in Table 3.
They show that the median rank for the real vault in NoC-
rack is 2.10 %, thus worsens the KL divergence attack result
(median of 1.97 %). Note, for easier comparison we also
report numbers for the static Markov NLE, which is intro-
duced in Section 6. For Markov, we see a decrease of the
median ranking result to 7.22 %, compared to the KL diver-
gence attack with a median of 14.24 %.
5.2 Password Reuse
It is well known that users tend to reuse passwords across
services. Reported numbers diﬀer and range from around
10 % to around 60 % [12, 2, 10]. Hence, we expect to ﬁnd
this amount of reuse in the vaults as well. NoCrack simulates
password reuse by decoding sub-grammars (see Section 2.3),
Figure 2: Result distribution of the KL divergence experi-
ment for single (unrelated) passwords. The real vault is sam-
pled from RockYou, the decoy vaults are sampled from distri-
bution approximations of real-world passwords and artiﬁcial
ones, i. e., NoCrack (MPW) and static Markov (MPW).
Results.
The results are summarized in Table 2. First, we see that
NoCrack performs worse on these artiﬁcial vaults, i. e., KL
divergence is substantially better at distinguishing the dis-
tribution generated by NoCrack from these artiﬁcial vaults.
As we used independent passwords for NoCrack as well, the
diﬀerences that allow us to distinguish are caused by the
distribution of passwords. The most likely reason for this
behavior is that 10 independently chosen passwords carry
more information than 10 passwords with a high reuse, as it
is observed in the PBVault leak.
Second, we see that the distributions of RockYou, Yahoo,
and Gmail are rather hard to distinguish. Apparently, their
distributions are relatively similar. Third, MySpace is quite
diﬀerent from RockYou, Yahoo, and Gmail, and is relatively
easy to distinguish from them. Lastly, as expected, compar-
ing one distribution against the same distribution has an
average rank of 50 %. Note that these results are not sym-
metric, i. e., it makes a diﬀerence which distributions the
decoys are chosen from.
Table 3: Rank results based on four diﬀerent attacks against entire vaults, where smaller numbers mean a more eﬃcient
attack. Note, for easier comparison we also report numbers for the static Markov NLE, which is introduced in Section 6.
Decoy vaults are chosen from the NoCrack or Markov distribution, real vaults are chosen from the PBVault distribution. We
list the results for varying classes of vault sizes.
