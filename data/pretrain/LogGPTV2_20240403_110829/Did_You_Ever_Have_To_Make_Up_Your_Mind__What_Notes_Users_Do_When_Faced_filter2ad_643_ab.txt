### Indication of User Thoughtfulness
The level of thought a user gives to a question can be inferred from their response. Figure 4 illustrates the second alert.

### Active Content and Document Design
To attach active content to a document, the document must be sent with its own design (form) rather than using a form from the mail database. The form and its active content were not signed, so operations requiring ECL permissions would be checked against the "-No Signature-" entry in the reader's ECL.

### User Interaction with New Mail
Users received new mail from their colleague Jane Doe/SoftwareHouse, titled "Important Information." When they opened the email or selected it with the preview pane enabled, if their ECLs did not allow unsigned code to access another database, a "-No Signature-" Execution Security Alert (ESA) appeared, covering much of the email content. Since the mail used a standard stored form, the top quarter of the message lacked the formatted header section, which typically includes the sender's name on the left and To:, CC:, BCC:, and Subject: fields on the right. Users could move the dialog or respond via the buttons. If they glanced at the bottom edge of the Notes client, they would see the status message "Signed by Jane Doe/SoftwareHouse on 11/22/1999 at 02:20:46 according to /SoftwareHouse." If they responded with "Execute Once" or "Trust Signer," and if their ECL did not allow unsigned code to send mail on their behalf, the second ESA (Figure 4) would appear. Dismissing this dialog fully revealed the email content.

### Survey Message Text
The survey text (Figure 5) explained the purpose of the survey and encouraged users who did not allow the unsigned code to execute to send an email to the contact person for data collection (the Gold Star list). The survey was sent by a junior security person from SoftwareHouse to the same list that received the earlier email about securing ECLs.

**Subject: Important Information**

Dear Colleague,

I am Jane Doe from the SoftwareHouse security group. To assess the effectiveness of our efforts in tightening workstation ECLs, we are collecting data on whether anyone at SoftwareHouse still allows unsigned code to automatically execute on their workstation. 

- If your ECL is open, you did not see any alerts and should send me an email confirming that you allow unsigned code.
- If you saw the alerts and allowed the code to execute by pressing "Execute Once" or "Trust Signer," please also send me an email.
- If you aborted the code execution, thank you. You can further help by sending me an email, allowing me to add you to our Gold Star list of colleagues who practice good ECL hygiene.

Thank you for participating in our study. Feel free to send any questions or concerns.

Jane Doe

### Results and Discussion
#### Core Results
Figure 6 shows the results from the first two days of the survey. Out of 543 names on the SoftwareHouse email list, 334 (62%) responded within two days. The "Other" category included bounced deliveries and out-of-office notices. 

- **Responses:**
  - 227 (68% of respondents, 42% of the total) did not allow unsigned code to access another database and send mail.
  - 102 (31% of respondents, 18% of the total) had open ECL defaults.
  - 92 (28% of respondents) did not execute the unsigned code.
  - 135 (40% of respondents) clicked and sent.
  - 5 (1% of respondents) were in the "Other" category.

#### Analysis
- 68% of respondents (227) or 42% of the survey population did not allow unsigned code to access another database and send mail.
- 31% of respondents (102) had open ECL defaults.
- A minimum of 42% and a maximum of 82% of the survey population had secure ECL defaults.
- 28% of respondents (92) did not execute the unsigned code.
- 56% of the target population did not execute the unsigned active content.
- 44% of the target population executed unsigned active content, including 18% who did so automatically.

#### Other Issues Affecting Responses
- 13 Gold Star users (15%) moved the ESA dialog aside and read the email before aborting the active content.
- 4 Gold Stars let one alert go and caught it on the second.
- One user had their mail database configured to not allow stored forms, providing extra security.
- Several people complained about seeing many alerts, which negates the purpose of ECLs.
- SoftwareHouse had no process to keep the Administrative ECL current.
- 12 people disregarded the unsigned nature of the alert due to the sender's email signature information.

#### Miscellaneous Other Issues
- At least 23 people pressed "Trust Signer" to the first alert, making their ECLs more open.
- Some users read the email on machines other than their primary work machine.
- Several users were concerned about their previous unawareness of the issue.
- Requests for more documentation and best practices were made.

### Recent Enhancements
- **Refresh Button:** Added in R5.0.5 to provide a consistent mechanism for refreshing ECLs.
- **Domino 6:** Provides full control over updating client ECLs through administrative policies.
- **ECL Policies:** Allow administrators to define named administrative ECLs and update policies, ensuring ECLs stay in sync with organizational standards.

### Conclusion
The survey highlighted the need for better ECL management and user education. While many users had secure ECL settings, a significant portion still executed unsigned code, indicating the importance of ongoing security awareness and training.
