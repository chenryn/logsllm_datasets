ABSTRACT
A PHY and MAC protocol for MIMO concurrent transmis-
sions, called Contrabass, is presented. Concurrent trans-
missions, also referred to as multi-user MIMO, are simulta-
neous transmissions by multiple interfering nodes over the
same carrier frequency. Concurrent transmissions technique
has the potential of mitigating the overhead of MAC proto-
cols by amortizing protocol overhead among multiple pack-
ets. However, existing proposals for concurrent transmis-
sions could not achieve this as MIMO channel training and
collision avoidance typically involve an expensive process
of coordination and control message exchanges. This over-
head has made MIMO concurrent transmission Impractical
and thus unused in real applications. Contrabass imple-
ments simultaneous channel training and optimal transmis-
sion control without any coordination. As a result, Con-
trabass achieves very high aggregate throughput, low delays
and scalability even under dynamic environments and out-
performs the existing MIMO protocols. This is the ﬁrst
practical implementation of MIMO-based concurrent trans-
missions. We implemented Contrabass in GNU radios and
also in NS-2.

An important attribute of MIMO (multiple input multiple
output) based multi-antenna processing is the spatial mul-
tiplexing. The nodes can simultaneously exchange up to m
wireless frames over the same carrier frequency when there
are m antennas at the receivers.
Recently, IEEE has announced the standardization of 802.11n
that utilizes the spatial multiplexing capability of MIMO.

802.11n is one form of the exclusive transmission protocols
in that only one transmitter is allowed to transmit at a time,
using all of its antennas. With the exclusive transmission,
a single packet is transmitted at a higher data rate (i.e., m
times a link rate of a single transceiver).
The problem with the exclusive transmissions is that the
protocol overhead, such as channel training, ACK frame
transmissions, idle slots and packet collisions, is constant re-
gardless of the link layer data rate. This wasted portion of
channel time largely prevents the performance improvement
of the system. To mitigate the overhead, 802.11n performs
a frame aggregation by merging multiple packets into a sin-
gle large frame. But in many situations the aggregation is
not possible due to the diverse traﬃc patterns and network
topologies. Also, the large size of the frame often increases
the chance of channel errors.
Concurrent transmissions, on the other hand, can nat-
urally implement the overhead amortizement as they per-
mit multiple nodes to participate in the transmission at the
same time. Since packets are available from multiple nodes,
there are more opportunities for simultaneous transmissions.
Also, it is possible to adjust the average number of concur-
rent transmissions such that the chance of successful packet
transmission is maximized, while minimizing the collisions
and the channel errors. See Sundaresan et al. [7] for more
cases where concurrent transmissions perform better than
exclusive transmissions.
There have been several proposals for the concurrent trans-
missions including [3, 6, 7]. Unfortunately, these protocols
incur too much control overhead, diminishing the poten-
tial gains from the concurrent transmissions. The primary
source of the overhead is the use of control messages such
as RTS and CTS. The reason for the negotiation is twofold.
First, the explicit channel training scheme, such as MMSE
(minimum mean squared error), is known to be optimal but
requires the dedicated channel training period for each trans-
mitter and receiver pair. Unlike the exclusive transmissions,
where only one node transmits and thus easily schedules the
channel training, the concurrent transmissions require the
negotiation between multiple transmitter and receiver pairs.
Second, the transmitters should adjust the number of con-
current transmissions such that the total number does not
exceed the number of antennas at the receivers.
Our goal is to design an eﬃcient PHY/MAC protocol for
concurrent transmissions that does not require any coordi-
nation. Contrabass does not introduce any control frame
exchange and each node does not require any prior knowl-
edges other than the MAC addresses of receivers.

1. PROTOCOL DESIGN
Contrabass uses RLS (recursive least squares) based chan-
nel training [2]. With RLS, a receiver can train the chan-
nel ﬁlter even with the overlapped training sequences from
multiple transmitters. The multiple transmitters can start
transmissions without the scheduling of the channel training.
RLS has never been used for concurrent channel training as
it requires a longer training sequence than MMSE. However,
as control messages are not used, the overhead due to the
longer training sequence is easily compensated by the con-
current transmissions gain. RLS requires that the training
sequence should be unique per any receiver.
There are two main challenges for coordination-free RLS-
based concurrent transmissions. First, a receiver needs to
identify and tune to an incoming training sequence to itself,
among multiple overlapped signals. Second, the total num-
ber of concurrent transmissions must be kept less than but
close to m.
To solve the ﬁrst problem, a transmitter generates an RLS
training sequence using the receiver’s ID (MAC address), cir-
cularly bit-shifts the training sequence to begin at a random
index and embeds it into the preamble of the packet. The
receiver then correlates the incoming signals with the shared
training sequence, ﬁnds the synchronization point and trains
the channel ﬁlter accordingly. It performs SIC (successive
interference cancellation) [4] to cancel out the decoded sig-
nals and to further ﬁnd other incoming training sequences
and repeats the process from the start.
To solve the second problem, Contrabass adopts a p-persistent
CSMA style MAC protocol and adjusts the transmission at-
tempt probability during the runtime (Figure 1). The op-
timal transmission attempt probability that maximizes the
chance of successful transmission is mathematically derived
as follows:
τopt =
1
mq(cid:0)n−1
m (cid:1) + 1
,
where n is the number of transmitters within the interference
range and m is the number of antennas at the receiver. Note
that n is diﬃcult to know in the real environment. Hence, we
take a control-theoretical approach to match the observed
contention level to one obtained from mathematically de-
rived optimal result. The algorithm is highly adaptive to
the level of contention and does not require any knowledge
of n.
2. EVALUATION
We have implemented the PHY portion of Contrabass in-
cluding RLS, RIC and SIC, in the GNU Radio platform[1]
and conducted a proof of concept experiment. Our ex-
periment indicates that Contrabass can successfully decode
signals from concurrent transmissions using its PHY pro-

tation of real-time carrier sensing [5]. To overcome this
limitation of evaluation using GNU radio implementation,
we implemented the entire protocol of Contrabass is imple-
mented in NS-2 for evaluation under diverse network topolo-
gies and conditions. Contrabass and several existing con-
current transmission protocols, and IEEE 802.11n are tested
under diverse network and traﬃc conditions. Figure 2 shows
the simulation result when the 100 nodes are exchanging
FTP traﬃc while total number of sessions is varied. Com-
pared to IEEE 802.11 with frame aggregation, it achieves
about 60 to 70% performance improvement under high load.
We also veriﬁed that Contrabass shows high scalability un-
der other diverse traﬃc load conditions such as Web traf-
ﬁc and VoIP traﬃc in terms of throughput and delays, and
greatly outperforms the existing concurrent transmission pro-
tocols. The most salient key advantage of Contrabass is its
amenability to practical implementation.
