### [Vial](vial.md)
* New: Introduce Vial.
    [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) is an open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time.
    Even though you can use a [web version](https://vial.rocks/) you can install it locally through an [AppImage](https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/)
    - Download [the latest version](https://get.vial.today/download/)
    - Give it execution permissions
    - Add the file somewhere in your `$PATH`
    On linux you [need to configure an `udev` rule](https://get.vial.today/manual/linux-udev.html).
    For a universal access rule for any device with Vial firmware, run this in your shell while logged in as your user (this will only work with sudo installed):
    ```bash
    export USER_GID=`id -g`; sudo --preserve-env=USER_GID sh -c 'echo "KERNEL==\"hidraw*\", SUBSYSTEM==\"hidraw\", ATTRS{serial}==\"*vial:f64c2b3c*\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"$USER_GID\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", TAG+=\"udev-acl\"" > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-vial.rules && udevadm control --reload && udevadm trigger'
    ```
    This command will automatically create a `udev` rule and reload the `udev` system.

## [Gardening](gardening.md)
* New: [Fertilizing with manure.](gardening.md#fertilizing-with-manure)
    Manure is one of the best organic fertilizers for plants. It's made by the accumulation of excrements of bats, sea birds and seals and it usually doesn't contain additives or synthetic chemical components.
    This fertilizer is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which are key minerals for the growth of plants. These components help the regeneration of the soil, the enrichment in terms of nutrients and also acts as fungicide preventing plagues.
    Manure is a fertilizer of slow absorption, which means that it's released to the plants in an efficient, controlled and slow pace. That way the plants take the nutrients when they need them.
    The best moment to use it is at spring and depending on the type of plant you should apply it between each month and a half and three months. It's use in winter is not recommended, as it may burn the plant's roots.
    Manure can be obtained in dust or liquid state. The first is perfect to scatter directly over the earth, while the second is better used on plant pots. You don't need to use much, in fact, with just a pair of spoons per pot is enough. Apply it around the base of the plant, avoiding it's touch with leaves, stem or exposed roots, as it may burn them. After you apply them remember to water them often, keep in mind that it's like a heavy greasy sandwich for the plants, and they need water to digest it.
    For my indoor plants I'm going to apply a small dose (one spoon per plant) at the start of Autumn (first days of September), and two spoons at the start of spring (first days of March).

* Correction: Update introduction.
    The method was described by David Allen in a book with the same name. It's clear that the book is the corner stone of David's business. He is selling his method on every word, some times to the point of tiresome. It's also repeats the same ideas on different parts of the book, I guess that's good in terms of sticking an idea in the people's mind, but if you're already convinced and are trying to sum up the book it's like, hey, I have 90% of the valuable contents of this chapter already in my summary. It's obvious too the context of the writer, that the book was written a while ago and who does it write to. It talks quite often about assistants, bosses of high firm companies he's helped, preferring low-tech physical solutions over digital ones, a lot of references about parenting... If you're able to ignore all the above, it's actually a very good book. The guy has been polishing the method for more than 30 years, and has pretty nice ideas that can change how you manage your life.
    My idea of this summary is to try to extract the useful ideas removing all those old-fashioned capitalist values from it.
* New: Guides on processing your inbox.
    Remember to follow the next rules while processing the items:
    - Process the top item first: that way you treat each element equally, so the "least" important ones are not left dangling forever in your inbox thus thwarting it's purpose.
    - Process one item at a time.
    - Never put anything back into “in.”
    For each element you need to ask yourself: "What's the next action?".
* New: How to clarify your inbox items.
    If you can do something about the element, you need to think which is the next physical, visible activity that would be required to move the situation towards closure. It's tricky, something like "set meeting" won't do because it's not descriptive of physical behaviour. There is still stuff to decide how, when, with whom, if you don't do it now you won't empty your head and the uncertainty will create a psychological gap that will make you procrastinate, so define the next action now. "Decide what to do about X" doesn't work either, you may need to gather more information on the topic, but deciding doesn't take time.
    Once you have the next action, if it can be done in two minutes or less, do it when you first pick the item up. Even if it is not a high-priority one, do it now if you’re ever going to do it at all. The rationale for the two-minute rule is that it’s more or less the point where it starts taking longer to store and track an item than to deal with it the first time it’s in your hands. Two minutes is just a guideline. If you have a long open window of time in which to process your in-tray, you can extend the cutoff for each item to five or ten minutes. If you’ve got to get to the bottom of all your input rapidly, then you may want to shorten the time to one minute, or even thirty seconds, so you can get through everything a little faster.
    There’s nothing you really need to track about your two-minute actions. Just do them. If, however, you take an action and don’t finish the project with that one action, you’ll need to clarify what’s next on it, and manage that according to the same criteria.
    If the next action is going to take longer than two minutes, ask yourself, “Am I the best person to be doing it?” If not, hand it off to the appropriate person, in order of priority:
    * Send an e-mail.
    * Write a note or an over-note on paper and route it to that person.
    * Send it a instant message.
    * Add it as an agenda item on a list for your next real-time conversation with that person.
    * Talk with her directly, either face-to-face or by phone.
    When you hand it off to someone else, and if you care at all whether something happens as a result, you’ll need to track it. Depending on how active you need to be it can go to your Waiting list or to your tickler.
* Correction: Deprecate pydo.

* New: UPGRADE FAILED: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress.
    This error can happen for few reasons, but it most commonly occurs when there is an interruption during the upgrade/install process as you already mentioned.
    To fix this one may need to, first rollback to another version, then reinstall or helm upgrade again.
    Try below command to list the available charts:
    ```bash
    helm ls --namespace 
    ```
    You may note that when running that command ,it may not show any columns with information. If that's the case try to check the history of the previous deployment
    ```bash
    helm history  --namespace 
    ```
    This provides with information mostly like the original installation was never completed successfully and is pending state something like STATUS: `pending-upgrade` state.
    To escape from this state, use the rollback command:
    ```bash
    helm rollback   --namespace 
    ```
    `revision` is optional, but you should try to provide it.
    You may then try to issue your original command again to upgrade or reinstall.

* New: Introduce RSS.
    Note: This post is a shameless direct copy of [Nicky beautiful post, read it there as it has beautiful illustrations](https://ncase.me/rss/)
    **[What is RSS (Really Simple Syndication)?](https://ncase.me/rss/)**
    Imagine an open version of Twitter or Facebook News Feed, with no psy-op ads, owned by no oligopoly, manipulated by no algorithm, and all under your full control.
    Imagine a version of the newsletter where you don't have to worry about them selling your email to scammers, labyrinth-like unsubscribe pages, or stuffing your inbox with ever more crap.
    Now imagine this existed and was extremely popular 15 years ago. Then we got suckered by the shiny walled gardens.
    Well, it's time to make like a tree and go back to the future, baby!
    **[How does RSS work?](https://ncase.me/rss/)**
    Unlike newsletters where give each publisher your email (and they may abuse that trust), RSS works on a "don't call me, I'll call you" policy.
    An RSS feed is a text file on a website. It's just a bunch of posts – no tracking or "personalization" – like a printed newspaper:
    Then, whatever RSS reader app you use – you can use any app made by anyone – it'll call the websites for the feeds you specifically opted into, no more or less. The websites can't force it in the other direction.
    Your app then shows you your posts in good ol' reverse chronological order. (Some apps let you add extra filters, but unlike social media algorithms, you control 'em.) Apps also make the posts prettier than raw text:
    Really Simple, indeed!
    **[Cool, how do I get started?](https://ncase.me/rss/)**
    First, you need a reader app. Such as the minimalist [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/), but [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) is the most popular, and folks use [The Old Reader](https://theoldreader.com/). See this [list of readers](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).
    To add a feed to your app, just paste a link to the blog/site, and your app will automatically find the feed! RSS also lets you follow creators on YouTube, Substack, Medium, and more.
    **[Tips for using RSS wisely](https://ncase.me/rss/)**
    - Beware the hoarder instinct. No algorithm can save you from hoarding feeds "just in case", then being overwhelmed. The only cure is to ruthlessly Marie Kondo that crap – if a feed doesn't consistently enrich your life, cut it.
    - Some feeds only give you the excerpt of a post, with a link to see the full post at their site. Don't follow those: they break you out of the RSS reading experience, and trick you into losing time on their site. (This is a harsh rule: I used to follow Quanta Magazine's feed, but they switched from full-text to excerpts, so I unsubscribed.)
    - Don't follow feeds that update more than once a day. Go for daily digests, or better yet, weekly digests.
    **[If RSS Was So Great, Why'd It Die In The First Place](https://ncase.me/rss/)**
    Well, Google killed Google Reader in 2013, the #1 RSS reader at the time. This was to make way for Google Plus, which failed. The sacrificial lamb was for nothing.
    But Google only did what nearly everyone – including yours truly – did in 2013: leave the open, decentralized Web 1.0 for the shiny new Web 2.0 platforms. Why? Well, it was more fun & convenient.
    But now in 2021, for most of us, social media is very not fun and not convenient. That's why I went back to the future with RSS, and wrote this post encouraging you to do the same!
    (Ok, RSS had two more problems: 1) Getting overwhelmed with feeds. As said above, the only cure is to trim ruthlessly. 2) RSS lets you serve text/link/image ads, but not the creepy user-tracking ads. In 2013 that was the "best" way make money on the web, but these days ad revenue is dying, and subscriptions like Patreon/Substack are thriving.)
    And that's all, folks! Now you know how to escape the attention-draining, empathy-killing, critical-thought-suffocating siren song of the algorithms. And get your inbox less cluttered with newsletters.
    Here's to a renaissance for a kinder, better web. <3
* New: Introduce the analysis of life process.
    It's interesting to do analysis at representative moments of the year. It gives it an emotional weight. You can for example use the solstices or my personal version of the solstices:
    - Spring analysis (1st of March): For me the spring is the real start of the year, it's when life explodes after the stillness of the winter. The sun starts to set later enough so that you have light in the afternoons, the climate gets warmer thus inviting you to be more outside, the nature is blooming new leaves and flowers. It is then a moment to build new projects and set the current year on track.
    - Summer analysis (1st of June): I hate heat, so summer is a moment of retreat. Everyone temporarily stop their lives, we go on holidays and all social projects slow their pace. Even the news have even less interesting things to report. It's so hot outside that some of us seek the cold refuge of home or remote holiday places. Days are long and people love to hang out till late, so usually you wake up later, thus having less time to actually do stuff. Even in the moments when you are alone the heat drains your energy to be productive. It is then a moment to relax and gather forces for the next trimester. It's also perfect to develop *easy* and *chill* personal projects that have been forgotten in a drawer. Lower your expectations and just flow with what your body asks you.
    - Autumn analysis (1st of September): September it's another key moment for many people. We have it hardcoded in our life since we were children as it was the start of school. People feel energized after the summer holidays and are eager to get back to their lives and stopped projects. You're already 6 months into the year, so it's a good moment to review your year plan and decide how you want to invest your energy reserves.
    - Winter analysis (1st of December): December is the cue that the year is coming to an end. The days grow shorter and colder, they basically invite you to enjoy a cup of tea under a blanket. It is then a good time to get into your cave and do an introspection analysis on the whole year and prepare the ground for the coming year.
    We see then that the year is divided in two sets of an expansion trimester and a retreat one. We can use this information to plan our tasks accordingly. In the expansion trimester we could invest more energies in the planning, and in the retreat ones we can do more throughout reviews.
* New: How to create a prometheus exporter with python.
    [prometheus-client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python) is the official Python client for [Prometheus](prometheus.md).
    Installation:
    ```bash
    pip install prometheus-client
    ```
    Here is a simple script:
    ```python
    from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Summary
    import random
    import time
    REQUEST_TIME = Summary('request_processing_seconds', 'Time spent processing request')
    @REQUEST_TIME.time()
    def process_request(t):
        """A dummy function that takes some time."""
        time.sleep(t)
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # Start up the server to expose the metrics.
        start_http_server(8000)
        # Generate some requests.
        while True:
            process_request(random.random())
    ```
    Then you can visit http://localhost:8000/ to view the metrics.
    From one easy to use decorator you get:
    - `request_processing_seconds_count`: Number of times this function was called.
    - `request_processing_seconds_sum`: Total amount of time spent in this function.
    Prometheus's rate function allows calculation of both requests per second, and latency over time from this data.
    In addition if you're on Linux the process metrics expose CPU, memory and other information about the process for free.
