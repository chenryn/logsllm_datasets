I have tried several Python IDEs on the Windows platform, and I found that Eclipse, combined with the PyDev plugin, best meets my needs. This toolset is user-friendly and efficient. I am currently working on a relatively large project.

Given my recent move and lack of internet access, I would like to use a version control system (VCS) that can be installed locally on my hard drive. While CVS is an option, I am open to using any other VCS as well. It would be ideal if the VCS could be easily integrated with Eclipse.

Could anyone suggest a solution or provide some guidance? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Please excuse any errors in my English.

Last time I attempted this, I found that Eclipse does not natively support direct access to local repositories in the same way that the command-line version of CVS does. This is because the command-line CVS has both client and server functionalities, while Eclipse only provides the client side and requires a server, such as pserver, to function properly. Therefore, you might need to set up a CVS server.

However, it's worth noting that Eclipse maintains its own history of changes, so you may only need to manually update your CVS repository at major milestones. In my experience, I eventually decided not to use CVS with Eclipse under Linux, as it had issues with symbolic links and sometimes deleted include files during synchronization with the repository.

I hope this information helps, and I look forward to hearing any additional suggestions.
