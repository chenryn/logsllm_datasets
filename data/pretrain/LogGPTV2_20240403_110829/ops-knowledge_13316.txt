User: I tried several Python IDEs (on Windows platform) but finally I found only Eclipse + PyDev meeting my needs. This set of tools is really comfortable and easy to use. I'm currently working on a quite bigger project. I'd like to have a possibility to use CVS or any other version control system which would be installed on my local harddrive (I recently moved my house and don't have yet an access to internet.)
It doesn't matter for me if it'd be CVS - can also be any other version control system. It'd be great if it will be not too hard to configure with Eclipse. Can anyone give me some possible solution? Any hints?
Regards and thanks in advance for any clues. Please forgive my English ;)
Assistant: Last time I tried this, Eclipse did not support direct access to local repositories in the same way that command line cvs does because command line cvs has both client and server functionality whereas Eclipse only has client functionality and needs to go through (e.g.) pserver, so you would probably need to have a cvs server running.
Turns out that I didn't really need it anyway as Eclipse keeps its own history of all changes so I only needed to do an occasional manual update to cvs at major milestones.
[Eventually I decided not to use cvs at all with Eclipse under Linux as it got confused by symlinks and started deleting my include files when it "synchronised" with the repository.]
