Subject: Issue with Removing Unwanted Dimensions Using Hadoop Indexing Task in Druid 0.10.1

Hello,

I am currently experiencing difficulties when attempting to remove unwanted dimensions from segments using the Hadoop indexing task in Druid version 0.10.1. This issue has been discussed in more detail on the Druid user group forum, which you can find [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-user/aBbuMYNRID8).

To resolve this, I have attempted two different approaches:
- **Schemaless approach** using `dimensionExclusions` as shown in this [configuration example](https://pastebin.com/raw/DwXw8dmE).
- Specifying only the desired `dimensions` as detailed in this [alternative configuration](https://pastebin.com/raw/cxFBYn7q).

Despite these efforts, the reindexed segments still contain all the unwanted dimensions.

Initially, I suspected that the dimensions were not being properly excluded due to an issue with the ParseSpec. To address this, I also tried specifying the dimensions within the `IoConfig.InputSpec.IngestionSpec.dimension` field, but unfortunately, this did not resolve the problem.

Thank you for any assistance or guidance you can provide.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
