Hey,
on druid `0.10.1` I'm having troubles cleaning up segments from unwanted
dimensions using hadoop indexing task. Discussed in here
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/druid-user/aBbuMYNRID8
I tried both schemaless approach `dimensionExclusions`
https://pastebin.com/raw/DwXw8dmE and `dimensions`
https://pastebin.com/raw/cxFBYn7q ... segments get reindexed but they contain
all those unwanted dimensions.
At first I thought that the dimensions are not picked up from ParseSpec, so I
also tried to specify it in `IoConfig.InputSpec.IngestionSpec.dimension` too,
but that didn't help.
