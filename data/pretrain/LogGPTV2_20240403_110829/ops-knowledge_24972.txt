User: Question: In command line, how do I call a python script without having to type python in front of the script's name? Is this even possible?

Info:
I wrote a handy script for accessing sqlite databases from command line, but I kind of don't like having to type "python SQLsap args" and would rather just type "SQLsap args". I don't know if this is even possible, but it would be good to know if it is. For more than just this program.
Assistant: Assuming this is on a unix system, you can add a "shebang" on the top of the file like this:
#!/usr/bin/env python
And then set the executable flag like this:
chmod +x SQLsap
