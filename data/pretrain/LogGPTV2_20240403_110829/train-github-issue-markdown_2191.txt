Hello, I can’t remap any key to the _play/pause_ key. Every other key combo
works, including other media keys, but nothing works to create a play/pause
key (my current keyboard is lacking media keys). Even using the option to type
the key I’m choosing, and using a spare keyboard with media keys, so I know
I’m picking the right option - doesn't work.

I've tried another utility called uncap, to run this change as well, but it
didn't work either: `uncap 0x6A:0xB3` should map the multiply * on the numpad
to the play/pause key.  
I know that it is possible, because using sharpkeys it did work
