## Abstract

In recent years, significant progress has been made in transitioning distributed MIMO systems from theoretical concepts to practical implementations. While prior work has demonstrated the feasibility of synchronizing multiple transmitters in time, frequency, and phase, none have delivered a full-fledged physical layer (PHY) capable of supporting real-time distributed MIMO. Additionally, these systems fail to address dynamic environments or mobile clients. To overcome these challenges, new solutions are required for low-overhead and fast tracking of wireless channels, which are crucial parameters in any distributed MIMO system. Furthermore, a software-hardware architecture is needed that can deliver a fully functional 802.11 PHY while meeting the stringent timing constraints of the 802.11 protocol. This architecture must also support coordinated power control across distributed MIMO nodes, rather than allowing each node to perform power control independently.

This paper presents the design and implementation of MegaMIMO 2.0, a system that achieves these goals and delivers the first real-time, fully distributed 802.11 MIMO system.

## Introduction

Distributed MIMO has long been studied theoretically due to its potential to significantly increase the throughput of wireless networks [3, 14, 16, 9]. Recent years have seen substantial interest in translating this theory into practice. Several studies [11, 4, 17] have shown the ability to synchronize distributed transmitters, enabling them to concurrently transmit to multiple independent receivers without interference.

The primary focus of past work has been on synchronizing time, frequency, and phase across multiple transmitters. However, several additional critical challenges need to be addressed to make distributed MIMO practical. Specifically, for distributed MIMO to be effective in real-world settings, it must operate in real-time, adapt to dynamic environments, and support mobile clients.

This paper introduces MegaMIMO 2.0, the first real-time, fully distributed 802.11 MIMO system. MegaMIMO 2.0 provides a full-featured 802.11 PHY while adhering to the tight timing constraints of the 802.11 protocol. It also supports dynamic environments and mobile clients. To achieve these performance goals, MegaMIMO 2.0 addresses the following key challenges:

### 1. Real-time Channel Updates

At the core of all distributed MIMO designs is a subsystem that measures the channels from all transmitters to all end users and uses these measurements for beamforming and nulling. For real-time systems, these measurements must be collected and updated within tens of milliseconds. In today's point-to-point MIMO systems, channel measurement is already known to be high overhead [10]. In a distributed MIMO scenario, the problem becomes even more complex as all senders must measure channels to all clients for all subcarriers.

To illustrate the significance of this overhead, we simulate a distributed system with N access points and N clients. Using typical feedback parameters (8 bits magnitude and phase for all OFDM subcarriers, and QPSK with 1/2 rate for the channel feedback data), we evaluate the overhead for various channel feedback intervals. Figure 1 shows that at typical coherence times of about 100ms, the channel feedback overhead can significantly limit the gains of distributed MIMO systems, especially as they scale to more nodes. For mobile clients with lower coherence times, the overhead is even higher.

Figure 1: Channel feedback overhead for distributed MIMO systems. The figure shows that at typical coherence times of about 100ms, the channel feedback overhead can significantly limit the gains of distributed MIMO systems, particularly as they scale to more nodes. For mobile clients with lower coherence times, the overhead is even higher.

To address this challenge, MegaMIMO 2.0 leverages channel reciprocity. Reciprocity refers to the property that the over-the-air channel from node A to node B is the same as the over-the-air channel from node B to node A. Point-to-point MIMO systems use reciprocity to infer the forward channel from reverse channel measurements. However, in distributed MIMO systems, there is no constant calibration factor that can be computed once and applied to correct for reciprocity. We present a mathematical model that captures the variations in the calibration factor in a distributed system and introduce a protocol that computes these variations without additional transmission overhead, thereby extending the benefits of reciprocity to distributed MIMO systems.

### 2. Power Control

Practical wireless systems use Automatic Gain Control (AGC), an analog module that dynamically adjusts the received signal to ensure it fills the range of the ADC. In a distributed MIMO system, nodes must maintain a consistent view of the channels and other signaling information. Additionally, these measurements must be consistent over time. These requirements conflict with current AGCs, which operate independently and have no memory across packets. Disabling individual AGC control is not feasible as it would lead to a significant performance loss.

MegaMIMO 2.0 infers the AGC parameters from the hardware on a per-packet basis and incorporates these parameters into both distributed MIMO signaling and channel estimation.

### 3. Redesigning the Baseband and Firmware

Distributed MIMO requires a redesign of the firmware-hardware interface. Event timing in existing Wi-Fi stacks is local to each device, and the firmware-hardware interface operates on event sequences with timing embedded in the hardware. In contrast, a distributed MIMO system requires the hardware to react to interactions between devices and perform coordinated actions across multiple devices. MegaMIMO 2.0 extends the interface between the PHY and MAC to support such distributed coordination and enhances the real-time component of the MAC to enable distributed coordination using local actions at each node.

### Implementation and Evaluation

We implemented MegaMIMO 2.0 on a system-on-module consisting of an FPGA connected by a high-speed bus to an ARM core. Our implementation features a real-time, full-featured 802.11 PHY capable of distributed MIMO. We evaluated our system in an indoor deployment with multiple 802.11 distributed-MIMO capable APs and unmodified 802.11 clients. Our results show the following:

- **Real-time Adaptation:** MegaMIMO 2.0 can deliver a real-time distributed MIMO system capable of adapting to mobile devices and dynamic environments. A four-AP distributed MIMO system running MegaMIMO 2.0 achieved a median throughput of 120 Mb/s and a maximum throughput of 194 Mb/s to four clients mounted on moving Roomba robots.
- **Reciprocity Accuracy and Necessity:** MegaMIMO 2.0’s reciprocity is both accurate and necessary for high throughput. In a fully static environment, beamforming using reciprocity and explicit feedback deliver the same gain. In a mobile environment, explicit feedback reduces the median throughput by 20% compared to reciprocity due to feedback overhead. Reducing the feedback rate can decrease throughput by up to 6x due to stale channel information. These results highlight the importance of using reciprocity even in a relatively small 4x4 distributed MIMO system.
- **Distributed Power Control:** MegaMIMO 2.0’s ability to accommodate distributed power control is critical. Without distributed gain control, the throughput of clients drops dramatically as the channels between some APs and clients become significantly weaker than others. Our experiments show a reduction of 5.1x in throughput when distributed power control is deactivated.

## Related Work

There is extensive theoretical work analyzing the performance gains provided by distributed MIMO, showing that it can scale wireless throughput with the size of the network [3, 14, 16, 9]. Motivated by these results, recent research efforts have focused on moving theory to practice [11, 4, 17, 2]. While these systems differ in details, they primarily address the synchronization of transmitters in time, phase, and frequency, and do not address power control or the overhead of learning and tracking channels. They demonstrate their results using one-shot channel measurements and do not design or show a full-featured physical layer or a real-time system capable of handling moving clients and dynamic environments.

Recent industry efforts aim to build distributed MIMO systems [7, 1, 6], but these systems are based on CoMP (cooperative multi-point), which assumes a shared clock and a dedicated high-throughput fiber backhaul infrastructure. Examples include PCell [7, 1] and a demonstration by Ericsson [6]. In contrast, MegaMIMO 2.0 operates with fully distributed independent radios and does not require a single clock. It introduces a new technique for extending reciprocity to distributed MIMO systems and presents detailed evaluation results.

Other related work includes studies on the use of reciprocity for channel estimation [5, 8, 13] and scalable channel estimation techniques for massive MIMO systems [12]. However, these systems assume a shared clock and are limited to scenarios where all antennas are on the same device. MegaMIMO 2.0 demonstrates how to extend reciprocity to distributed scenarios, enabling scalable channel estimation for distributed MIMO.

## Overview of MegaMIMO 2.0

MegaMIMO 2.0 is a combined hardware-software system that performs distributed MIMO across multiple APs to multiple clients. The hardware implements a fully 802.11 a/g/n compatible PHY with enhancements to support distributed MIMO. The software at each AP calibrates the AP for adapting uplink channel estimates and performing power control. Additionally, the software at each node performs distributed MIMO, tracks channels to each client, and coordinates between APs to perform distributed beamforming to the clients.

MegaMIMO 2.0 is designed to work across a distributed set of nodes without requiring a shared clock. It builds upon a prior system, MegaMIMO [11], and extends its design and implementation to support reciprocity, distributed power control, and a full-featured real-time 802.11 PHY. At a high level, MegaMIMO 2.0 works as follows: One AP acts as the lead AP (master AP), and all other APs act as slaves. Each slave AP maintains a reference channel from the lead AP. A joint transmission is initiated by the lead AP by transmitting a synchronization header, followed after a fixed time by the data. Each slave hears the synchronization header and transmits the data at the appropriate time, ensuring synchronized transmission.

## Conclusion

MegaMIMO 2.0 represents a significant step forward in the practical implementation of distributed MIMO systems. By addressing the key challenges of real-time channel updates, power control, and rearchitecting the baseband and firmware, MegaMIMO 2.0 delivers the first real-time, fully distributed 802.11 MIMO system. This system not only meets the stringent timing constraints of the 802.11 protocol but also supports dynamic environments and mobile clients, making it a robust solution for next-generation wireless networks.
