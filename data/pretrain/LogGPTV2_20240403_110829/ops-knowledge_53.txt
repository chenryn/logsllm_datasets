User: I tried to install python module via pip, but it was not successful. 
can any one help me to install smtplib python module in ubuntu 12.10 OS?
Assistant: I will tell you a probable why you might be getting error like Error no module smtplib
I had created program as email.py
Now email is a module in python and because of that it start giving error for smtplib also
then I had to delete email.pyc file created and then rename email.py to mymail.py
After that no error of smtplib
Make sure your file name is not conflicting with the python module. Also see because of that any *.pyc file created inside the folder
