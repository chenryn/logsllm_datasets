Subject: Issue with TypeScript Compilation in Visual Studio

Hello everyone,

I am currently working with a set of TypeScript files that compile successfully under `tsc` when run through Node.js on a Windows system. However, when I attempt to compile these same files using the Visual Studio TypeScript 1.7.6.0 extension, which utilizes `tsc.exe`, I encounter what appear to be incorrect errors. These errors seem to contradict the actual source code.

As a temporary solution, I created a custom `tsc.exe` that invokes the TypeScript compiler via Node.js. I then replaced the default `tsc.exe` located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\TypeScript\1.7\` with my custom version.

It would be highly beneficial if the Visual Studio extension provided an option for users to specify which compiler implementation to use, either Node.js or `tsc.exe`.

Thank you,
