Hi all,
I have a collection of TypeScript files that, on Windows, compile under tsc
when run under node, but throw bogus errors (I can clearly see the source
contradicts them) when compiled via the Visual Studio TypeScript 1.7.6.0
extension which uses tsc.exe. I implemented a very temporary workaround by
creating my own `tsc.exe` which simply invokes the compiler via node and
overrwrote the default `tsc.exe`, found in `c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
SDKs\TypeScript\1.7\` with my own.
It would be great if the Visual Studio extension allowed the user the option
to specify the compiler implementation to use, Node or tsc.exe.
