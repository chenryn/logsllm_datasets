ship data then we denote this with ASk ∈ IXP .

Our heuristics are applied on a traceroute path in a sliding window fashion,
where the length of the window is three. By carefully reasoning about all possible
combinations of evidence from Steps 1 and 2 that exist for three subsequent hops,
we formulated 16 cases. Each case corresponds to a detection rule. For brevity,
we next discuss only the cases (8 in total) that appeared with frequency higher
than 1 % in the matched IXP paths. The remaining cases are still supported
in traIXroute. In Table 1 we show our detection rules for the most typical
scenario, when we observe a single IXP IP address between two non-IXP IP
addresses. We also consider the special case, shown in Table 2, when we observe
two adjacent IP addresses from an IXP subnet. In most cases, we can deduce
the exact link where the IXP was crossed, which we denote in Tables 1 and 2
as a or b. We split the rules into strong and weak evidence rules and order them
based on their frequency, as shown in the last column of the tables (cf. Sect. 4).

Rules 1.1 to 1.3 match the IP addresses of routers on the IXP subnet, extract
information about the adjacent ASes, and ﬁnd that both ASes are members of
the IXP. In the Rules 1.1 and 1.2 the IXP is crossed in the ﬁrst hop. The Rule
1.2 is otherwise the same with the Rule 1.1, but without information for ASk+2.
Finally, the Rule 1.3 is also identical otherwise, but with ASk+2 (cid:4)= ASk+1. These
three rules check multiple criteria and exploit data about triplets, which give also
an association from IP addresses to ASes with high accuracy (cf. Sect. 4.2). We
therefore consider that these rules rely on stronger evidence than the Rules 1.4
to 1.7.
The Rules 1.4 and 1.5 do not match a triplet, but only an IXP preﬁx. In
addition, we ﬁnd that one of the two adjacent ASes is a member of the IXP. Based
on this evidence, we consider that an IXP may have been crossed. However, we
have much weaker evidence than when Rules 1.1-1.3 hold. traIXroute marks
these cases as potential IXP crossing. Similarly, the Rules 1.6 and 1.7 match an
IP address from a triplet, however only one or none of the adjacent ASes is a
member of the IXP. We also have weaker evidence in these detections.
Finally, the Rule 2 in Table 2 ﬁnds two consecutive IP addresses that match
triplets from the same IXP. The ASes in the triplets are also found members of
the IXP. We consider this also as strong evidence for IXP detection, since mul-
tiple evidence indicate so. This is a particularly interesting case, as it indicates
that the IXP fabric may have been crossed twice. In other words, we observe in
few cases a type of “ping pong” routing over the IXP fabric.
4 Evaluation
In this section, we evaluate and validate our methodology. We downloaded the
IXP Memberships Dataset and the IXP IP Address Preﬁxes Dataset from PDB
and PCH on January, the 10th 2015. Our Routeviews Preﬁx to AS mappings
Dataset was downloaded from CAIDA on January, the 20th 2015.
4.1 Data Coverage and Hit Rates
PDB includes membership data for 448 (88 %) out of the 509 IXPs in the data-
base. Similarly, PCH provides membership data for 343 (74 %) out of the 466
traIXroute: Detecting IXPs in traceroute paths
353
IXPs it includes. PDB and PCH provide membership data for 100 % and 62 %,
accordingly, out of the top-50 IXPs (sorted by the number of their AS members).
Besides, 312 of the IXPs in PDB and 343 of the IXPs in PCH provide IXP IP
address preﬁxes. After merging, the combined dataset has 475 address preﬁxes
for 417 IXPs and a total of 12,716 IXP membership triplets {IP address −→
IXP, AS} for 460 IXPs, i.e., an increase of 38.5 % and 3.2 %, correspondingly,
with respect to the largest individual dataset. These statistics along with other
details are summarized in Table 3. For comparison, the April 2009 experiment
reported by Augustin et al. [13] found triplets for 119 IXPs by querying 1.1 K
BGP Looking Glass servers.
We then discuss the hit rate of the rules in Tables 1 and 2 in our traIXroute
probes to shed more light onto the methodology. The strong evidence Rules 1.1
to 1.3 collectively account for 76.86 % of the detected IXPs, which shows that in
most cases we can detect IXPs, while satisfying multiple criteria: (i) we observe
an exact IP address of a BGP router on the IXP subnet; and (ii) we ﬁnd that both
ASes are members of the candidate IXP. Rule 1.1 is by far the most frequent
as it matches 65.57 % of the detected IXPs. This indicates that the available
datasets from PDB and PCH about exact IXP router addresses are rich enough
to match most IXP addresses observed in traceroute measurements.
Rules 1.4 to 1.7 collectively account for 19.02 % of the matches. These rules
rely on weaker evidence. The Rules 1.4 and 1.5, in particular, which rely on
IXP preﬁxes match 13.25 % of the cases. We observe that IXP preﬁxes add a
moderate amount of weak evidence matches compared to the IXP membership
data.
Rule 2 hits in 1.36 % of the detected IXPs. This illustrates that in a few cases,
the IXP fabric maybe crossed twice. This points to ineﬃcient routing due to the
BGP path selection process that relies on AS-level paths and ignores layer-2
topologies. In this case, the layer-2 IXP fabric is likely crossed back and forth,
consuming resources.
Besides, we explored a number of other rules, which we do not show in
Tables 1 and 2 because they matched in less than 1 % of the cases. From these
rules, we conﬁrmed (as expected) that the IXP link is almost always before the
observed IXP address. This is because routers typically reply with the IP address
of the inbound interface. In just 0.71 % of the cases we observed the IP address,
which matched an IXP triplet, to belong to the same AS with the preceding IP
address. Another interesting observation is that when an IP address matches an
IXP preﬁx, but not an IXP triplet, then in only 2.98 % of the matches both of the

adjacent ASes are members of the IXP. In contrast, the corresponding number
for matched IXP triplets is 81.79 %. This supports further the point that triplets
help to detect IXPs more reliably than IXP preﬁxes.
4.2 Data Accuracy and Validation
The data in PDB are primarily self-reported by IXP and ISP operators, while
the data in PCH are based primarily on live BGP Route Collectors that PCH
operates in multiple IXP sites, where it is an IXP member and peers with other
ASes. The PDB data are often used by network operators for checking and
conﬁguring their routers. A recent study [26] showed that 99 % of the valid (i.e.,
that conform to the correct format) IP addresses reported in PDB matched the
IP addresses used by BGP routers, based on a sample submitted by network
operators for 256 routers. We validate further the accuracy of the used PDB
and PCH IXP membership data based on BGP feeds from the Route Collectors
of PCH.
We parse BGP routing table dumps downloaded on January, the 31st 2015
from 87 Route Collectors operated by PCH. Route Collectors on IXPs peer with
members of the IXP to provide a live view of their routing announcements. They
are therefore an excellent reference for validation because their attributes, e.g.
IP addresses and AS numbers, are used in live BGP sessions. For each routing
table entry, we extract the next hop IP address and the ﬁrst AS in the AS
path. We then compare the extracted data with the corresponding information
from PDB and PCH. We ﬁnd that 93.4 % of the 4,655 {IXP-AS} tuples, which
are common between PDB and BGP, have consistent IP addresses. Accordingly,
92.1 % of the 3,073 {IXP-AS} tuples, which are common between PCH and
BGP, have consistent IP addresses. This data is summarized in Table 4. This
high degree of consistency shows that triplets {IP address −→ IXP, AS} from
PDB and PCH are a valid source of information for detecting IXPs in traceroute
paths. The inconsistent part could result from stale or incomplete information
in PDB and PCH. Triplets with stale IP addresses will not help, but will not
also introduce problems in detecting IXPs with our methodology. Finally, we
note that although the triplets we exploit have a reasonable level of accuracy,
their completeness is hard to assess. This is a limitation for our work. However,
our analysis is encouraging because we ﬁnd 12,716 triplets for 460 IXPs after
merging the PDB and PCH data.
Finally, as an extra validation step we cross-checked the Routeviews Preﬁx
to AS mappings Dataset from CAIDA with the IP to ASN mapping service of
Team Cymru [6] and found that the two mappings were fully consistent.
5 Use Case: IXPs in Traceroute Paths
Having evaluated and validated our approach, we next do a preliminary analysis
of what we can learn about IXPs using an IXP-informed traceroute tool. We use
traceroute paths collected from CAIDA’s Ark measurement infrastructure [8],

which at the time of our experiments had 107 monitors distributed around the
globe (split into three teams of similar size). The monitors rely on the scamper
tool [24] conﬁgured with the Paris traceroute technique [12] to mitigate artifacts
due to load balancing. We use one full cycle of measurements collected on Janu-
ary, the 20th 2015, which includes an ICMP-paris probe to each globally routed
