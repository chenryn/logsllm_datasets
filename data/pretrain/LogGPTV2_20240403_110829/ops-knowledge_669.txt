User: Is there a way to generically retrieve process stats using Perl or Python? We could keep it Linux specific.
There are a few problems: I won't know the PID ahead of time, but I can run the process in question from the script itself. For example, I'd have no problem doing:
./myscript.pl some/process/I/want/to/get/stats/for
Basically, I'd like to, at the very least, get the memory consumption of the process, but the more information I can get the better (like run time of the process, average CPU usage of the process, etc.)
Thanks.
Assistant: A common misconception is that reading /proc is like reading /home. /proc is designed to give you the same information with one open() that 20 similar syscalls filling some structure could provide. Reading it does not pollute buffers, send innocent programs to paging hell or otherwise contribute to the death of kittens.
Accessing /proc/foo is just telling the kernel "give me information on foo that I can process in a language agnostic way"
If you need more details on what is in /proc/{pid}/ , update your question and I'll post them.
