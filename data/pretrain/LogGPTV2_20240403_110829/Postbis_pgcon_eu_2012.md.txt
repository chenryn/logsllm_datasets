Marine Microbiologie – Ecologically Important
1 millio n bacterial cells/cm3
ocean water
In total 1030
• More than stars in universe
½ of the world wide oxygen
production
½ of the earth biomass
The weight of
> 240 billion elephants
Single Bacterial Genomes
All heredity is
encoded in the
genomes of cells
Sequencing of
thousands of
genomes:
• Each ~ 5MB
Single Bacterial Annotation
Each gene
sequence needs
analysis
• Which sequences
are similar to
current one?
• What is the
function?
Gene:Oxy1
Metagenomics
From where to where ??

The Sequence Data
Single genomes Metagenomes
Sequencing of thousands Sequencing of thousands
of genomes each: of sample each:
• 1 long sequence • Millions of short sequences
• ~ 5MB • < 1 KB
• ~ 5000 genes/genome • Millions of genes/
metagenome
Standard bioinformatic query
Give me all sequences
which encode gene OXY1

Who is out there and where?
(in terms of sequenced genomes, metagenomes and key genes)
Kottmann et al. NAR 2010
Nice, nice
BUT
where is the
problem????

More efficient ways to store Sequence Data needed
http://www.microb3.eu All Bioinformatics moves
from flat files to NOSQL
(MongoDB)
We want to stay with
Postgreee’s great
features:
• Range types
• JSON
• hstore
• PostGIS
• Performance
(shared_buffer_cache)
• extensibility

1
What is biological sequence data?
Genomic DNA
Stores hereditary information
●
Encodes information as a sequence of 4 different bases:
●
– Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine
Example: ACGATCGACTGAC
Alphabet size = 4, up to 15
●
Lengths between few thousands and billions
●
Genomic DNA can be repetitive
●
2
What is biological sequence data?
Short Sequences
Short read DNA
●
– From 50 to 10,000 bases long
RNA
●
– Similar to short read DNA
Protein
●
– Alphabet of 20 to 23!
– At maximum thousands long
3
What is biological sequence data?
Alignments
Method to find and display
●
– Similarities
– Differences
Example:
●
– Compare ACGATCGACGCAT with ACGAAAGACGA
ACGATC--GACGCAT
ACGA--AAGACG-A-
Length depends on:
●
– Underlying sequences
– Their similarity
Long stretches of gap symbols
●
4
How does PostgreSQL compression work?
Lempel-Ziv PostgreSQL Variant
Maintains a sliding window
●
Finds match between
●
– Prefix of look-ahead buffer
– Substring starting in search buffer
Encodes matches with 2 or 3-byte tokens
●
No match → Standard encoding
●
Termination conditions
●
– Short than 32 character
– Compression less than 25%
– No match within first KB
5
How does PostgreSQL compression
perform on biological sequence data?
Entropy = average information content per
●
character
Lower bound for compression
●
Natural Text? 
●
Genomic DNA
●
~one third → fair compression
●
Short DNA, RNA, Protein
●
Not at all → no compression
●
Alignments
●
Often:
●
Down to entropy → very good compression
Sometimes:
●
less
6
How does PostBIS compression work?
1. Run-Length Encoding
TCGAAAAAAAAGCTAG
TCGr8AGCTAG
2. Huffman codes
3. Rare Symbol Swapping
7
How does PostBIS compression work?
Huffman codes
Reduced alphabet
●
Assign short codewords to frequent symbols
●
8
How does PostBIS compression work?
Rare Symbol Swapping
On DNA, Redundancy of 0.25 = 12.5% possible!
●
9
How does PostBIS compression work?
Rare Symbol Swapping
Lower Limit of Redundancy = 0.000003815
●

How does PostBIS compression work?
New data types:
●
DNA_SEQUENCE
●
RNA_SEQUENCE
●
AA_SEQUENCE
●
ALIGNED_DNA_SEQUENCE
●
ALIGNED_RNA_SEQUENCE
●
ALIGNED_AA_SEQUENCE
●
Type modifiers:
●
– CASE_SENSITIVE / CASE_INSENSITIVE
– FLC / IUPAC / ASCII
– SHORT / DEFAULT / REFERENCE (only DNA)

What can we do with PostBIS?
Sequences in database, now what!?
●
Doing Bioinformatics is flat file based
●
Select subset in database
●
Export sequences to flat-file
●
Do bioinformatics with command-line tool
●
Parse output
●
Import output to database
●
Use-Cases:
●
tRNAscan
●
Gene extraction
●
16
What can we do with PostBIS?
CREATE TABLE human_genome (
sequence dna_sequence(reference),
chromosome text
);
SELECT trna(sequence, chromosome)
INTO human_genes
FROM human_genome;
SELECT substr(a.sequence, b.start_pos, b.len)
FROM
human_genome AS a
INNER JOIN
human_genes AS b
ON a.chromosome = b.chromosome;

What do we want to do with PostBIS in the
future?
Reference-based compression
●
Reference-based heuristic approximative full-text
●
search
Compressive BLAST
●
NN-searches
●
FDWs for relevant file formats
●
Adapt existing tools
●
