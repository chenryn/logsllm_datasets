## Marine Microbiology: Ecologically Important
- **Density of Bacterial Cells:** Approximately 1 million bacterial cells per cubic centimeter of ocean water.
- **Total Number of Bacteria:** Estimated at 10^30, which is more than the number of stars in the universe.
- **Oxygen Production:** Bacteria contribute to about half of the world's oxygen production.
- **Biomass:** They make up approximately half of the Earth's biomass.
- **Weight Comparison:** The total weight of marine bacteria is greater than that of 240 billion elephants.

## Single Bacterial Genomes
- **Genetic Information:** All hereditary information is encoded in the genomes of bacterial cells.
- **Sequencing Efforts:** Thousands of bacterial genomes have been sequenced, each approximately 5 MB in size.

## Single Bacterial Annotation
- **Sequence Analysis:** Each gene sequence requires analysis to determine:
  - Similarity to known sequences.
  - Functional annotation.

### Example
- **Gene OXY1:** This gene is an example of a sequence that needs to be analyzed for its function and similarity to other sequences.

## Metagenomics
- **From Where to Where?**
- **Sequence Data:**
  - **Single Genomes:** Sequencing of thousands of genomes, each around 5 MB and containing approximately 5,000 genes.
  - **Metagenomes:** Sequencing of millions of short sequences (less than 1 KB) from environmental samples, resulting in millions of genes per metagenome.

### Standard Bioinformatic Query
- **Example Query:** "Give me all sequences that encode the gene OXY1."

### Ecological Perspective
- **Query with Geographical Constraints:**
  - "Give me all sequences that encode the gene OXY1 and were found at Helgoland roads at a depth deeper than 50 meters."

## Data Integration
- **Combining Sequence and Environmental Data:**
  - **Sequence Data:** Genomes, metagenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, marker genes.
  - **Environmental Data:** Latitude, longitude, depth, collection date, water currents, temperature.

### Result
- **Relationships:** Analyzing the integrated data to understand relationships between genetic and environmental factors.

## Megx.net: Data Portal for Microbial Ecological GenomiX
- **Open Source Software:**
  - **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension for geo-spatial data.
  - **Web Server:** Apache, UMN Mapserver.
  - **Web Client:** OpenLayers.

### Publication
- **Kottmann et al. NAR. 2010**

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Problem Statement:**
  - **Current Issue:** More efficient storage methods are needed for sequence data.
  - **Lincoln Stein's Insight:** Bioinformatics is moving from flat files to NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

- **PostgreSQL Features:**
  - **Range Types**
  - **JSON**
  - **hstore**
  - **PostGIS**
  - **Performance (shared_buffer_cache)**
  - **Extensibility**

## PostBIS: Biological Sequence Data Compression
### What is Biological Sequence Data?
- **Genomic DNA:**
  - **Hereditary Information:** Encoded as a sequence of four bases: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G).
  - **Example:** ACGATCGACTGAC
  - **Alphabet Size:** 4, up to 15.
  - **Length:** Ranges from a few thousand to billions of bases.
  - **Repetitiveness:** Genomic DNA can contain repetitive sequences.

- **Short Sequences:**
  - **Short Read DNA:** From 50 to 10,000 bases long.
  - **RNA:** Similar to short read DNA.
  - **Protein:** Alphabet of 20 to 23 amino acids, with lengths up to thousands.

- **Alignments:**
  - **Method:** Used to find and display similarities and differences between sequences.
  - **Example:** Compare ACGATCGACGCAT with ACGAAAGACGA.
  - **Length:** Depends on the underlying sequences and their similarity.
  - **Gap Symbols:** Long stretches of gap symbols may be present.

### How Does PostgreSQL Compression Work?
- **Lempel-Ziv PostgreSQL Variant:**
  - **Sliding Window:** Maintains a sliding window to find matches.
  - **Encoding Matches:** Matches are encoded with 2 or 3-byte tokens.
  - **Standard Encoding:** If no match is found, standard encoding is used.
  - **Termination Conditions:**
    - Shorter than 32 characters.
    - Compression less than 25%.
    - No match within the first kilobyte.

### Performance on Biological Sequence Data
- **Entropy:** Average information content per character, which is a lower bound for compression.
  - **Natural Text:** High entropy, good compression.
  - **Genomic DNA:** Entropy is about one-third, leading to fair compression.
  - **Short DNA, RNA, Protein:** Low entropy, poor compression.
  - **Alignments:** Often down to entropy, providing very good compression, but sometimes less.

### PostBIS Compression Techniques
- **Run-Length Encoding:**
  - **Example:** TCGAAAAAAAAGCTAG â†’ TCr8AGCTAG

- **Huffman Codes:**
  - **Reduced Alphabet:** Assigns short codewords to frequent symbols.

- **Rare Symbol Swapping:**
  - **DNA Redundancy:** Up to 12.5% possible.
  - **Lower Limit of Redundancy:** 0.000003815.

### New Data Types
- **Types:**
  - `DNA_SEQUENCE`
  - `RNA_SEQUENCE`
  - `AA_SEQUENCE`
  - `ALIGNED_DNA_SEQUENCE`
  - `ALIGNED_RNA_SEQUENCE`
  - `ALIGNED_AA_SEQUENCE`

- **Type Modifiers:**
  - **Case Sensitivity:** `CASE_SENSITIVE` / `CASE_INSENSITIVE`
  - **Character Sets:** `FLC` / `IUPAC` / `ASCII`
  - **Length Specifications:** `SHORT` / `DEFAULT` / `REFERENCE` (only for DNA)

### Performance Comparison

  - **Genomic DNA and Short Alignments:**
    - **Results:** Detailed performance metrics and comparisons.

### Use Cases
- **Bioinformatics Workflow:**
  - **Steps:**
    - Select a subset of sequences from the database.
    - Export sequences to flat files.
    - Perform bioinformatics analysis using command-line tools.
    - Parse the output.
    - Import the results back into the database.

- **Examples:**
  - **tRNAscan:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE human_genome (
        sequence dna_sequence(reference),
        chromosome text
    );
    SELECT trna(sequence, chromosome)
    INTO human_genes
    FROM human_genome;
    SELECT substr(a.sequence, b.start_pos, b.len)
    FROM human_genome AS a
    INNER JOIN human_genes AS b
    ON a.chromosome = b.chromosome;
    ```
