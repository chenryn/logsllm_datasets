I recently wrote a Python script that I run from the command line with various options. Now, I would like to create a simple web interface to call this script locally on my Mac.

To avoid the minor hassle of setting up mod_python or mod_wsgi, I was considering using PHP's `system()` or `popen()` functions to execute the Python script. 

Are there any better approaches to achieve this? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Additionally, if you are working within a virtual environment (such as in a shared hosting setup), make sure to adjust the path to the Python interpreter. For example, you might need to use `/home/user/mypython/bin/python ./cgi-bin/test.py`.
