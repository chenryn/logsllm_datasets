User: I have a Python script I recently wrote that I call using the command line with some options. I now want a very thin web interface to call this script locally on my Mac.
I don't want to go through the minor trouble of installing mod_python or mod_wsgi on my Mac, so I was just going to do a system() or popen() from PHP to call the Python script.
Any better ideas? Thanks in advance!
Assistant: Note that if you are using a virtual environment (as in shared hosting) then you must adjust your path to python, e.g: /home/user/mypython/bin/python ./cgi-bin/test.py
