User: I'm using a bunch of python packages for my research that I install in my home directory using the --user option of pip. There are also some packages that were installed by the package manager of my distribution for other things. I would like to have a pip command that only upgrade the packages I installed myself with the --user option.
I tried the recommend version pip freeze --local | grep -v '^\-e' | cut -d = -f 1  | xargs pip install -U but this seems to only work using virtualenvs. pip freeze --local is showing packages that are installed for my user and systemwide.
Is there a way to upgrade only the packages installed locally for my user?
Assistant: I would suggest creating virtual environment if it is possible for you.
You would just use sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv to install virtualenv, then enter your folder where you store python projects and type into terminal virtualenv venv. After that, you can activate it like this source venv/bin/activate.
What it does is it creates almost full copy of python (some libraries are just linked to save space) and everything you do after activating only affects that copy, not global environment. Therefore you can install any set of libraries using pip, update them etc. and you won't change anything outside of virtual environment. But don't forget to activate it first before you do anything.
