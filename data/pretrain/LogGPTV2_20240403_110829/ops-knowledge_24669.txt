User: I am using a Python on a Mac and I know that Python 2 comes preinstalled on the system (and in fact usable through Terminal). Is there a way to make it so Terminal can run Python 3? Can/should you set this as a default? I know changing the default settings for Python version usage could break your system so should I just install Python 3 and then use it through its launch icon instead?
Assistant: as usual in Mac python 2.7 is already installed, however if you installed python 3+ 
then you can just type in terminal: python3 
so that you can use the newer version that you installed.
if you want to use python 2.7 then just type: python
