User: I wanted to use the Python installed under cygwin rather than one installed under WinXP directly, so I edited ~/.bashrc and sourced it.  Nothing changed.  I tried other things, but nothing I did changed $PATH in any way.  So I rebooted.  Aha; now $PATH has changed to what I wanted.
But, can anyone explain WHY this happened?  When do changes to the environment (and its variables) made via cygwin (and bash) take effect only after a reboot?
(Is this any way to run a railroad?)  (This question is unlikely to win any points, but I'm curious, and I'm also tired of wading through docs which don't help on this point.)
Assistant: A couple of things to try and rule out at least:

Do you get the same behavior as the following from the shell? (Pasted from my cygwin, which works as expected.)

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

$ export PATH=$PATH:/cygdrive/c/python/bin

$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/cygdrive/c/python/bin

Is your bashrc setting the PATH in a similar way to the above? (i.e. the second command).
Does your bashrc contain a "source" or "." command anywhere?  (Maybe it's sourcing another file which overwrites your PATH variable.)
