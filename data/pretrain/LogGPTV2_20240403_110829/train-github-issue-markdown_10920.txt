It would be great if you could cross compile binaries for different platforms
when using `deno compile`.
Example: `deno compile --target x86_64-apple-darwin
https://deno.land/std@0.79.0/http/file_server.ts` from Linux or Windows to
create a macOS binary.
This should be relatively trivial to implement. Instead of using the current
binary as the base binary for the compilation, we would download the binary
for the specified target (using the same code as `deno upgrade`), and then use
that as a compilation base binary.
