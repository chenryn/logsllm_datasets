**Abstract:**
This paper investigates the impact of technology scaling and microarchitectural trends on the soft error rate (SER) in CMOS memory and logic circuits. We present and validate an end-to-end model to compute the SER for both existing and future microprocessor designs. The model accounts for two key masking phenomena—electrical masking and latching-window masking—that reduce soft errors in combinational logic. We quantify the SER due to high-energy neutrons in SRAM cells, latches, and logic circuits for feature sizes ranging from 600 nm to 50 nm and clock periods from 16 to 6 fan-out-of-4 inverter delays. Our model predicts a nine-order-of-magnitude increase in the SER per chip of logic circuits from 1992 to 2011, reaching levels comparable to the SER of unprotected memory elements. This result underscores the need for computer system designers to address the risks of soft errors in logic circuits for future designs.

## 1. Introduction
Two primary trends driving microprocessor performance are the scaling of device feature sizes and the increasing depth of pipelines. This paper explores how these trends affect the susceptibility of microprocessors to soft errors. Device scaling involves reducing the size and voltage levels of transistors, which enhances performance by enabling higher frequencies. Pipelining is a microarchitectural technique that divides instruction processing into concurrent stages, improving instruction-level parallelism (ILP). Modern designs often use five to eight pipeline stages, with some recent designs employing twenty or more stages, known as superpipelined designs.

Our study focuses on soft errors, also called transient faults or single-event upsets (SEUs), caused by electrical noise or external radiation. Specifically, we examine soft errors induced by high-energy neutrons from cosmic rays. While mechanisms for detecting and correcting soft errors in memory elements (e.g., caches) using error-correcting codes (ECC) and parity are well-established, combinational logic has been less studied. Past research indicates that combinational logic is less susceptible to soft errors due to natural resistance mechanisms such as logical, electrical, and latching-window masking. We develop models for electrical and latching-window masking to understand their effects under device scaling and superpipelining. Using these models, we estimate the impact of these trends on the SER of combinational logic and compare it to the expected SER of memory elements.

The primary contribution of our work is the analysis of SER trends for SRAM cells, latches, and combinational logic. Our models predict that by 2011, the SER in combinational logic will be comparable to that of unprotected memory elements. This finding is significant because current methods for protecting combinational logic have substantial costs in terms of chip area, performance, and power consumption compared to protection mechanisms for memory elements.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Particles Causing Soft Errors
In the early 1980s, IBM conducted experiments to measure the particle flux from cosmic rays. These results show that lower-energy particles occur more frequently than higher-energy ones. As CMOS device sizes decrease, they become more susceptible to lower-energy particles, potentially leading to a higher rate of soft errors. This paper focuses on atmospheric neutrons with energies greater than 1 mega-electron-volt (MeV), a significant source of soft errors in memory elements. We do not consider alpha particles, which primarily originate from packaging impurities and can vary widely within a technology generation.

### 2.2 Soft Errors in Memory Circuits
High-energy neutrons striking sensitive regions in semiconductor devices deposit electron-hole pairs, creating a short-duration current pulse. In SRAM cells, this charge can exceed the critical charge required to flip the stored value, resulting in a soft error. The SER is typically expressed in Failures In Time (FIT), measuring the number of failures per 10^9 hours of operation. Studies have shown that the SER for constant-area SRAM arrays increases with decreasing device sizes, though the rate of increase varies among researchers.

A method for estimating SER in CMOS SRAM circuits was developed by Hazucha & Svensson. Their model, based on a verified empirical model for 600 nm technology, scales to other generations. The model is given by:

\[ \text{SER} = F \cdot A \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{Q_{CR}}{Q_S}\right) \]

where:
- \( F \) is the neutron flux with energy > 1 MeV, in particles/(cm²·s),
- \( A \) is the area of the circuit sensitive to particle strikes, in cm²,
- \( Q_{CR} \) is the critical charge, in fC,
- \( Q_S \) is the charge collection efficiency of the device, in fC.

The critical charge \( Q_{CR} \) and charge collection efficiency \( Q_S \) are key parameters, both decreasing with smaller feature sizes. Changes in \( Q_{CR} \) relative to \( Q_S \) significantly impact the SER. Hazucha & Svensson concluded that the SER-per-chip of SRAM circuits should increase at most linearly with decreasing feature size.

## 3. Soft Errors in Combinational Logic
A particle strike in a combinational logic circuit can alter the circuit's output, but a transient change will not affect the computation unless captured in a memory circuit. We define a soft error in combinational logic as a transient error that is subsequently stored in a processor's memory circuit. Transient errors may be masked by:
- **Logical Masking:** When a particle strike affects a portion of the combinational logic that does not influence the output.
- **Electrical Masking:** When the pulse is attenuated by subsequent gates, preventing it from affecting the circuit's result.
- **Latching-Window Masking:** When the pulse reaches a latch outside the clock transition where the latch captures its input value.

These masking effects significantly reduce the SER in combinational logic compared to storage circuits. However, as feature sizes decrease and pipeline depths increase, these effects may diminish. Smaller transistors and deeper pipelines can reduce electrical and latching-window masking, respectively.

We evaluate these effects using a simple model of a processor pipeline stage, consisting of a chain of homogeneous gates terminating in a level-sensitive latch. The number of gates is determined by the degree of pipelining, characterized by the number of fan-out-of-4 inverter (FO4) gates between latches. We use static NAND gates with a fan-out of 4.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Device Scaling Model
We constructed Spice Level 3 technology models corresponding to the SIA 1999 technology roadmap. Parameters such as drawn gate length, supply voltage, and oxide thickness were taken directly from the roadmap. Other parameters were obtained using McFarland's scaling methodology, with slight adjustments for threshold voltage.

### 4.2 Charge to Voltage Pulse Model
When a particle strikes a sensitive region, it produces a current pulse. The pulse shape can be approximated by a one-parameter function:

\[ I(t) = \frac{Q}{T} \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{T}} \]

where:
- \( Q \) is the total charge,
- \( T \) is the time constant.

### 4.3 Electrical Masking Model
We simulate the degradation of the pulse as it travels through the gates of the logic circuit. The model considers the attenuation effect of each gate on the pulse.

### 4.4 Latching-Window Masking Model
We determine the probability that the pulse is successfully latched by considering the timing of the pulse relative to the clock transition.

By combining these models, we estimate the SER of combinational logic. Additional details on our methodology are available in an extended version of this paper [30].
