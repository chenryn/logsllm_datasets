This issue is just tracking JuliaStats/Rmath.jl#7. I believe this issue here
needs to be added to the 0.5.0 milestone, and that is why I added a duplicate
here in the julia repo.
My understanding is that StatsFuns.jl relies on rmath. Previously rmath was
part of base and worked on all platforms. #6131 moved it out into
JuliaStats/Rmath.jl, but that package doesn't work on Windows, so now
StatsFuns.jl doesn't work anymore on Windows, and with that essentially the
whole julia statistics stack.
