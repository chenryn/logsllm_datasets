cation results of comparable accuracy to more complex methods.
An alternative and simpler method would be to use a geolocation
database to query for the server’s location, though some initial ex-
periments with such a database gave as inaccurate results mapping
each IP address to the location of the corresponding ISP.
Figure 11 shows the RTT results. The landmark locations are
shown in the x-axis. Each point in this plot is the minimum RTT
measurement between the corresponding landmark and the servers
of a RapidShare subnet. There are 36 points for each landmark,
one for each subnet. We sorted the landmarks according to the
minimum measured RTT across all subnets. Landmarks with RTTs
lower than 100ms are located in European countries. The lowest
RTTs come from landmarks in central Europe (Netherlands, Ger-
many and France). Landmarks in the US, Brazil or Japan give
much higher RTTs for all subnets. In some cases, the subnet mea-
surements from the same landmark are grouped in clusters; each
cluster corresponds to a different routing path from the landmark
to the corresponding subnets. The results of Figure 11 suggest that
all RapidShare subnets are probably located somewhere in central
Europe.
To identify the location of servers more accurately, we also ex-
amined the 2-3 last hops returned from traceroute towards all
RapidShare IP addresses, from a single landmark. There were 48
distinct names for the penultimate hop (the last router before the
destination machine): 41 of them appear to be located in Frankfurt,
Germany because their names contain either the name of that city
or airport/city abbreviations such as FRA and FFM. These 41 hops
account for 3566 of the server IP addresses. One hop name, ac-
counting for 743 IP addresses, contained the string VIE, which is
the abbreviation of the Vienna airport in Austria. For the remaining
penultimate hops, we had 5 IP addresses with no DNS name that
account for 161 RapidShare IP addresses. Using IP-geolocation
we pinned those addresses in a town in Germany close to Stuttgart
(Leinfelden-Echterdingen).
In summary, our geolocation analysis suggests that RapidShare
deploys all its server infrastructure at a single location that is in (or
Figure 10: Cumulative number of RapidShare server IP ad-
dresses seen in our traces.
6.1 Number of servers
Figure 10 shows the cumulative number of RapidShare server
IP addresses seen in our client-side traces. Recall that we iden-
tify such servers from the HOST header ﬁeld of the HTTP requests
seen at the two monitors. We observed 5,291 RapidShare server
IP addresses at Monitor1 and 5,135 server IP addresses at Moni-
tor2. The slight difference should be expected given there are more
clients, and thus more sessions, at Monitor1. The increase in the
number of servers in early September is interesting: RapidShare
had announced that they will increase their server infrastructure at
the same time period. 6
Note that each IP address does not necessarily correspond to a
distinct host. It is possible that the same host has several network
interfaces, or that the same physical host is used as multiple virtual
servers with distinct IP addresses. We attempted to infer, using the
IP-ID method [3], whether different server IP addresses generate
packets with interleaved IP-ID values, but we could not ﬁnd any.
Of course, this test does not exclude the possibility of server vir-
tualization, as two virtual servers on the same physical host would
run different IP stacks.
6.2 Address blocks and upstream ISPs
At both monitors, we observed that the server IP addresses be-
long to 36 distinct /24 subnets (the term “subnet” refers to a /24
preﬁx block in this paper). We looked up the origin-AS of these
subnets and the results are shown in Table 2. The 36 subnets are
allocated to 8 ISPs. This large degree of multihoming is typical for
large content providers, such as RapidShare [8]. Multihoming can
improve the reliability, performance and transit costs of a content
provider. In particular, a content provider would prefer to balance
its load among upstream providers so that the 95-th percentiles of
its outgoing trafﬁc through each provider remain as low as possi-
ble. There are commercial “intelligent route control” systems that
perform such load balancing optimizations [11].
6.3 Server locations
With such a large number of servers and upstream providers, we
may expect that RapidShare deploys servers in a large number of
different geographical locations, similar to standard CDN practices.
To explore this issue we probed the observed RapidShare server IP
addresses from multiple geographical locations (landmarks) using
traceroute. Our landmarks were several Planetlab hosts in dif-
ferent countries around the globe [6,28]. Our geolocation method is
simple and it is based on the minimum Round Trip Time (RTT) be-
tween each landmark and a server. Katz-Basset et al. [19] showed
that shortest RTT measurements using ping can provide geolo-

close to) Frankfurt, Germany. We will discuss the beneﬁts of such
a centralized infrastructure later in this section.
6.4 Content replication and server groups
Next, we estimate how many RapidShare servers host each ﬁle.
To do so, we used the Tor anonymity network [9] as a geographi-
cally distributed network of clients. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst collected
almost 22,000 RapidShare URLs from public indexing web sites,
and then we repeatedly requested those URLs for download using
421 different Tor exit nodes around the world (thus, each Tor node
appeared as a different client to the RapidShare servers).
We observed two RapidShare servers in each download request.
The ﬁrst is used as the “indexing server” and it returns the server
name that should be used for the download. The second is the actual
“download server” that sends the requested ﬁle. Interestingly, the
indexing server is always the same for a given ﬁle, while each ﬁle
can be served by 12 RapidShare download servers. We refer to the
dozen of servers that host the same ﬁle as a “server group”. Further,
it appears that all servers of the same group have two properties.
First, the last byte of their IP address is the same. Second, those 12
servers belong to different subnets (of the same or different ISPs).
As will be discussed later, each server group has a unique “group-
ID” number that also appears in the server’s name.
In summary, it appears that for each RapidShare hosted ﬁle, a
unique indexing server redirects each client request to one of 12
download servers. To increase availability in the presence of ISP
failures, and potentially to decrease transit fees, the download servers
of the same group belong to different subnets (and often, to differ-
ent ISPs).
6.5 Server Naming
RapidShare uses an interesting server naming scheme that allows
easy identiﬁcation of the upstream ISP and of the server group.
All server names start with the rs string. Then, the last byte
from the server’s IP address follows, either after reducing it by one
(to have a starting point at zero) or after subtracting 1 and then
adding 200, 400, or 600. The resulting number is the group-ID
that the server belongs to. The next part of the name is the initials
of the upstream ISP for that server. If there are several servers in
the group that are connected to the same ISP, there is an additional
number after the ISP initials.
For example, if a server has IP address 82.129.36.100 and its
content provider is Cogent, its DNS name will be one of the fol-
lowing: rs99cg.rapidshare.com, rs299cg.rapidshare.com, rs499cg.
rapidshare.com, rs699cg.rapidshare.com. The server’s group-ID,
in this example, will be 99, 299, 499, or 699. Thus, even though
the last byte of the IP address can have only 256 values, the group-
ID can take a much wider range of values. If there are two servers
in that group connected to Cogent, the string “cg” will be followed
by the number 1 or 2.
6.6 Server load balancing
In this section we explore the following two issues:
(1) Which server group will host a newly uploaded ﬁle?
(2) Which download server of that group will be used upon a down-
load request?
To answer these questions, we performed a number of active mea-
surements. When a user attempts to upload a ﬁle, the RapidShare
service ﬁrst responds with a list of 12 possible server names, part
of the same server group. At that point, the group-ID is already
determined and it can be inferred by the servers’ name. The user
can then select one of those servers and perform the upload. Note
that RapidShare has no information about the size or type of the
uploaded ﬁle when it determines the server group.
In our ﬁrst experiment we performed 50,000 back-to-back up-
load requests to RapidShare (without performing the actual up-
loads). For each upload request we logged the returned group-ID.
Figure 12 plots a histogram of the returned server groups. Observe
that there exist four different ranges of group-IDs with different
frequencies: 0-200, 200-400, 400-600 and 600-800. The ﬁrst two
have similar frequencies. It appears that the last two ranges cor-
respond to large service expansions that RapidShare performed in
Sep’08 (400-600) and in Mar’09 (600-800). Thus, more recently
deployed servers have larger group-IDs, as one would probably ex-
pect. It is interesting that servers with larger group-IDs get a higher
likelihood of upload assignments. Our interpretation of these re-
sults is that more upload requests are assigned to recently deployed
servers, which should also have more available capacity, attempting
to gradually balance the hosting load.
Our second experiment focuses on the download server selection
process. Since each ﬁle is hosted by a group of 12 servers, how
is the server that will handle a new download request selected?
We performed one thousand back-to-back download requests for
the same ﬁle and logged the returned download server. Figure 13
shows the histogram of the download servers for the correspond-
ing group (group-ID: 717). Note that 10 out of the 12 servers have
a very similar likelihood of serving the download requests. The
two remaining servers are selected with lower probability. Server
rs717l3 is also used as the indexing server for this group, and it
probably receives a lower download load due to its double role.

TORRENT
File sharing has traditionally used the p2p paradigm. p2p ﬁle
sharing, mostly using BitTorrent, is the dominant source of trafﬁc
in the Internet today. In this section we explore whether the dom-
inance of the p2p paradigm for ﬁle sharing can be challenged by
the emerging OCH paradigm. Do OCH services provide signiﬁ-
cant beneﬁts, in terms of performance or content availability, over
p2p applications for ﬁle sharing?
To answer this question, we compare RapidShare, the leading
OCH service, with BitTorrent, the leading p2p system, along the
dimensions of download throughput and content availability. We
think that these two factors are the most important from the typi-
cal user’s perspective. Cost is another important factor, of course,
when a user considers subscribing for a Premium RapidShare ac-
count. It should be noted that the following comparisons can only
consider the current deployment of these two services; obviously,
we cannot know whether the performance of RapidShare would de-
teriorate if that service was handling the same number of users as
BitTorrent.
7.1 Download throughput
To compare performance, we manually downloaded 38 ﬁles from
both services. The list of downloaded objects was randomly con-
structed from a number of indexing web sites, and it included a
variety of ﬁles.The sizes of the selected objects range from 1.6MB
to 2.85GB. Each content object was present in both services with
approximately the same ﬁle size and quality. 7 We made sure that
none of our downloads were illegal, requesting ﬁles that are not
copyrighted. In the case of BitTorrent, we selected those torrents
that had the larger population of seeders, to get the best down-
load throughput. All downloads were done from the same client
at FORTH. The client was connected to the public Internet through
a 1Gbps access link.
For RapidShare, we used three different types of users. The ﬁrst
role is a Premium user. The second role is a Free user. Free users
can download only one ﬁle at a time, and they are throttled to a
throughput between 0.2Mbps and 2Mbps. Further, Free users have
to wait for about 15 minutes between two successive downloads. In
our measurements, we included these long wait times in the total
download latency that a Free user experiences when she downloads
an object that consists of several ﬁles. The third role is again a Free
user that is able to change her IP address, through a new DHCP re-
quest, so that she can avoid the mandatory waiting period between
consecutive downloads. We refer to such users as Free-cheating. 8
Figure 14 shows the distribution of average throughput for each
of the three user roles. Note that Premium RapidShare users enjoy
a very high throughput compared to BitTorrent and the two other
user roles.
