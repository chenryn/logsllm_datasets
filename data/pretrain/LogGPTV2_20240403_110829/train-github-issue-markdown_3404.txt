  * I have searched the issues of this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.
## Expected Behavior
I would love either native support for custom scrollbars or some guidance on
how to get at components buried within other components (such as the ``
component within a `` component) to add external custom scrollbars.
## Current Behavior
Currently, after searching the issues, there doesn't seem to be any talk about
using custom scrollbars. (sorry if I missed it, I looked through about 4
pages) I am unable to find a way to wrap the `` called from ``
in my own custom scrollbar component.
## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)
  1. Use `` with a fixed height menu and notice that it uses the browsers default scrollbar. For example, the Multiple Select demo.
## Context
I have been able to wrap other Material-UI components in my custom scrollbar,
but I am unable to get at components called from other components, such as
``, so some of my elements have custom scrollbars and others do not.
