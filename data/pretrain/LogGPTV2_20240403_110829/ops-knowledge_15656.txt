User: As a key component in enterprise IT, the database needs to be backed up and restored to prevent data loss. Please describe common backup and recovery methods.
Assistant: Commonly used backup and recovery methods are as follows: 1. Full backup: back up the entire database, including all data and database structures. This is the most common backup method, and also the easiest. However, backups take a long time and require a lot of disk space. 2. Incremental backup: only backs up the data that has been modified since the last backup, so the backup time is shorter than full backup. However, the time of the last backup needs to be recorded, otherwise the range of the incremental backup cannot be determined. 3. Differential backup: Back up the parts that have changed since the last full backup. The backup time is longer than incremental backups, but shorter than both full and incremental backups. 4. Database mirroring: use a fully backed up database as the primary database, and create an identical copy on other servers at the same time. All changes made on the primary database are automatically synchronized to the replica database. 5. Recovery method: If you need to restore data, you can restore the data by restoring the backup file to the database. Restore methods include overwrite restore and selective restore. Overwrite restore is to overwrite the current database file with the full backup file, while selective restore can restore specific tables or data of the specified database. To sum up, enterprises need to choose appropriate backup and recovery methods to protect critical data from loss. In general, using incremental and differential backups reduces backup time and disk space usage, while database mirroring provides high availability and reduces downtime.
