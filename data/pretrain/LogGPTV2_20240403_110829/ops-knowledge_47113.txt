User: Please summarize and introduce some commonly used network monitoring tools and technologies, such as SNMP, SYSLOG, TCPDUMP, etc.
Assistant: 1. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) Simple Network Management Protocol: It is one of the most common network monitoring tools, which can monitor network devices, such as routers and switches. SNMP can collect performance and status information of network devices and provide real-time reports to administrators to facilitate policy and decision-making. 2. SYSLOG: It is the log file format and protocol of network devices such as operating systems, routers or switches, used to capture and record events and error information of devices and applications. It helps administrators understand device issues and network bottlenecks, and find potential network security issues. 3. TCPDUMP: is a command-line based network sniffing tool that captures, analyzes and displays network packets. It can be used for real-time packet capture and offline packet analysis to identify network problems and help infer related network faults. 4. Wireshark: It is a free network protocol analysis tool that can analyze and capture data packets of various communication protocols. It provides comprehensive protocol analysis and filtering functions, which can help administrators understand network details and locate possible problems. 5. Nagios: It is an open source IT infrastructure monitoring system designed to monitor the status of network devices, servers, applications and services. It allows administrators to understand the real-time status of devices, predict the future status of services and deal with them in a timely manner. 6. Cacti: It is an open source network graphical tool developed based on RRDtool, which can monitor the performance and status of various network devices such as switches, routers, and servers. Cacti can draw performance charts of network devices, making it easy for administrators to understand the status and trends of devices. 7. Rizhiyi: It is a tool for log and data analysis. Administrators can use it to count, analyze and manage a large number of log files to understand the real situation of network devices and services.
