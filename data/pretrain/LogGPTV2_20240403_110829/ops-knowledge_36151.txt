User: How to use the command line tool to get the HTTP response header and body of the target website?
Assistant: You can use the two command-line tools curl or wget to get the HTTP response header and body of the target website. Use the curl command: curl -i url This command will return the complete HTTP response, including response headers and body. Among them, the -i option means to return the HTTP response header information. If you only need to get the HTTP response header information, you can use the following command: curl -I url This command will only return the HTTP response header information. If you only need to get the HTTP body information, you can use the following command: curl -s url This command only returns the HTTP body information, and the -s option is used to turn off the progress bar of curl. Use the wget command: wget -S url This command will return the complete HTTP response, including response headers and body. Among them, the -S option means to return the HTTP response header information. If you only need to get the HTTP response header information, you can use the following command: wget --spider url This command will only return the HTTP response header information, and use the --spider option to disable the download function of wget. If you only need to get the HTTP text information, you can use the following command: wget -qO - url This command returns only the HTTP text information, and the -q option is used to turn off the log output of wget, and the -O option is used to output the HTTP text to standard output.
