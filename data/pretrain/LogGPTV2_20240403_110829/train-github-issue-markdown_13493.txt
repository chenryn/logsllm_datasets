### Describe the feature you would like.
#### First of all, we can use DistSQL create two READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE in
one logic schema.
eg:
    CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_0 (
    WRITE_RESOURCE=write_ds,
    READ_RESOURCES(read_ds_0,read_ds_1),
    TYPE(NAME=random)
    );
    CREATE READWRITE_SPLITTING RULE ms_group_1(
    WRITE_RESOURCE=write_ds,
    READ_RESOURCES(read_ds_0,read_ds_1),
    TYPE(NAME=random)
    );

#### But when we use select in this logic schema,we can't figure out how to
route,because of we have same table in two rules.
And it is not legal, because we cant't have two same table in one schema.
#### So,can we verify dataSource in ReadWrite-splitting rules? Ensures that a
logical schema does not exist the same table and cannot be routed.
