Digging into our data we ﬁnd “global passwords” which
are popular across all subgroups we observed. The single
most popular password we observed, for example, occurred
with probability at least 0.14% in every subpopulation. Some
overall popular passwords were very rare in certain subpop-
ulations. For example, the third most common password,
with overall probability 0.1%, occurred nearly 100 times
less frequently in some subpopulations. However, there were
eight passwords which occurred with probability at least
0.01% in every subpopulation. Without access to the raw
passwords, we can only speculate that these are numeric
passwords as these are popular21 and internationalize well.
Despite the existence of globally popular passwords,
however, we still conclude that dictionary speciﬁcity can
have surprisingly large results. For example, the following
table shows efﬁciency losses of up to 25% from dictionaries
tailored to people from different English-speaking countries:

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS
By establishing sound metrics and rigorously analyzing
the largest password corpus to date, we hope to have
contributed both tools and numbers of lasting signiﬁcance.
As a rule of thumb for security engineers, passwords
provide roughly equivalent security to 10-bit random strings
against an optimal online attacker trying a few popular
guesses for large list of accounts. In other words, an attacker
who can manage 10 guesses per account, typically within the
realm of rate-limiting mechanisms, will compromise around
1% of accounts, just as they would against random 10-bit
strings. Against an optimal attacker performing unrestricted
brute force and wanting to break half of all available
accounts, passwords appear to be roughly equivalent to 20-
bit random strings. This means that no practical amount of
iterated hashing can prevent an adversary from breaking a
large number of accounts given the opportunity for ofﬂine
search. An important caveat is that these passwords were
chosen with very few restrictions—a stricter password se-
lection policy might produce distributions with signiﬁcantly
higher resistance to guessing.
Still,
these numbers represents a minimal benchmark
which any serious password replacement scheme should
aim to decisively clear. The enormous gap between a real
password distribution and the theoretical space of passwords
shows why research proposals involving human-chosen se-
crets should estimate security using metrics like ˜µα and ˜Gα
to model partial guessing attacks. Where possible, compar-
ison to past empirical estimates of guessing attacks should
be provided, as we have done with Figures 1 and 6.
The most troubling ﬁnding of our study is how little
password distributions seem to vary, with all populations
of users we were able to isolate producing similar skewed
distributions with effective security varying by no more than
a few bits. Factors increasing security motivation like regis-
tering a payment card only seem to nudge users away from
the weakest passwords, and a limited natural experiment
on actively encouraging stronger passwords seems to have
made little difference. Passwords have been argued to be
“secure enough” for the web with users rationally choosing
weak passwords for accounts of little importance [50], but
these results may undermine this explanation as user choice
does not vary greatly with changing security concerns as
would be expected if weak passwords arose primarily due
to user apathy. This may indicate an underlying problem
with passwords that users aren’t willing or able to manage
how difﬁcult their passwords are to guess.
