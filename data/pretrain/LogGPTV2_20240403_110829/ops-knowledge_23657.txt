User: I have a web crawling python script running in terminal for several hours, which is continuously populating my database. It has several nested for loops. For some reasons I need to restart my computer and continue my script from exactly the place where I left. Is it possible to preserve the pointer state and resume the previously running script in terminal?
I am looking for a solution which will work without altering the python script. Modifying the  code is a lower priority as that would mean to relaunch the program and reinvest time.
Update:
Thanks for the VM suggestion. I'll take that. For the sake of completion, what generic modifications should be made to script to make it pause and resumable?
Update2:
Porting on VM works fine. I have also modified script to make it failsafe against network failures. Code written below.
Assistant: If this problem is important enough to warrant this kind of financial investment, you could run the script on a virtual machine. When you need to shut down, suspend the virtual machine, and then shut down the computer. When you want to start again, start the computer, and then wake up your virtual machine.
