Loggercomes with a limited functionality trial license  that is valid for only 90 days. To access the full functionality,  upload your EPS or GB per day licenseas  standalone ArcSightLogger or Managed by ArcMC. See "Trial Licenses" on page11 for more information.If you do not have a license file, see "Acquiring a License for Software Logger" on the next page. You need a separate license file for each instance of Software Logger. A license file is uniquely generated for each Logger download. 
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 24 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
The type of license you have affects how the license usage restriction function works and what is displayed on the License Usage page.l Formanaged by ArcMC Loggers, ArcSight Management Centermanages the  license (EPS or GB per 	day) restrictions. Refer to the ArcSight Management Center Administrator's Guide for more information. 
l For standalone ArcSightLoggers, the license usage restriction  function manages the license (EPS or GB 	per day) restrictions.The license usage restriction function adds the sum of the sizes of the events received on a given day to compute the amount of data that comes into Logger per day. Logger compares that value against the daily data limit in the license. If this limit is exceeded, Logger continues to collect and store events, so that no events are lost. For GB per day license, if the daily data limit is exceeded on more than five days in a 30-day sliding window, all search-related features are disabled. You will not be able to forward, search, or run reports on the collected events until the 30-day sliding window contains five or less data limit violations. For EPS, there is no over the limit restrictions for the 45 days displayed on the graph.The license usage page (Configuration > Advanced > License Usage) lists the data stored on your Software Logger on day-by-day basis in the last 45 days for EPS ( 30 days for GB per day). It also indicates the days on which data limits were exceeded. For more information, see configuration chapter of the . 
Acquiring a License for Software LoggerAcquiring a License for Software Logger
Software Logger requires a license file for installation. To acquire the license, follow the instructions in the Electronic Delivery Receipt you receive from Micro Focus via email after you place the order. Contact  in case you no longer have the document. 
Logger managed by ArcMC:Logger managed by ArcMC: 
Several Loggers cannot use the same license unless they are managed by ArcMC.  The same license needs to be added in each Logger and also in ArcMC (which will act as the License Server). For more information on how to add a license in ArcMC, refer to the . 
Standalone Logger:Standalone Logger: 
Make sure to add a separate, not re-used, license file for each Logger (License compliance will be determined by each Logger).  For more information on how to add a license in Logger, see System Admin Chapter in . 
To view more details about the current license (after Logger's installation), please go to System Admin >License & Update page and Configuration > Advanced > License Information. For more information, refer to the Configuration and System Admin chapters of the .Prerequisites for Installation
Make sure these prerequisites are met before you install the Logger software:
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 25 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
l Ensure that you are installing Logger on a supported platform. Refer to the Release Notes and ArcSight Data Platform Support Matrix for this information. These documents are available for download on .l If you are installing on RHEL 7.X, edit the logind.conf file as described in "Editing the logind 	Configuration File for RHEL 7.X" on page28.
l Increase the user process limit on your Operating System, as described in "Increasing the User Process 	Limit and the Maximum Number of Open Files" on the next page.
l Make sure that you have the latest supported tzdata rpm, tzdata2019c, installed on your OS before 	installing Logger.l Before deploying in a production environment, get valid license file. If you do not have a license file, see "Acquiring a License for Software Logger" on the previous page. You may need a separate license file for each instance of  Logger. A license file is uniquely generated for each  download.l A non-root user account must exist on the system on which you are installing Logger, or  the installer will ask you to provide one. Even if you install as root, a non-root user account is still required. The  userid and  its primary groupid should be the same for this account. The  UID for the non-root user should be 1500  and the GID should be 750. For example, to create the non-root user, run these commands as root:groupadd –g 750 arcsight
useradd –m –g arcsight –u 1500 arcsight
These commands create a non-root user named arcsight that will work with a Logger software installation.
l Decide whether to install Logger while logged in as root or as a non-root user. Your installation options 	vary depending on which user you choose.
Tip: If you are installing as a non-root user, the user must have privileges to write to theinstallation directory and its sub-directories.  For example, for the non-root user arcsight, use the 
command chown -R arcsight:arcsight /opt/arcsight.
a. If you install as root, you can choose to configure Logger to start as a service and select the port on 	which Logger listens for secure web connections.
b. If you install as the non-root user, Logger can only listen for connections on port 9000/tcp. You 	cannot configure the port to a different value.Note: The user must have privileges to write to the installation directory and its sub-directories, 
for example, chown –R arcsight /opt/arcsight.
c. When upgrading, you cannot change a previous non-root installation to a root-user installation. You 	will need to use the previously configured port 9000/tcp for accessing Software Logger.l Install into an empty folder. If you have uninstalled Logger previously, and are installing into the same 	location, be sure to remove any files that the uninstaller left in place.
Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 26 of 74
Installation and Configuration Guide
l The hostname of the machine on which you are installing Logger cannot be “localhost.” If it is, change 	the hostname before proceeding with the installation.l You must not have an instance of MySQL installed on the machine on which you install Logger. If an 	instance of MySQL exists on that machine, uninstall it before installing Logger.
l If you are installing/ uninstalling Logger in console mode with a non-root user, you must unset the 	DISPLAY environment variable by executing the following command unset DISPLAY.oIf you will be installing  Logger over an SSH connection and want to use the GUI mode of installation, make sure that you have enabled X window forwarding using the -X option so that you can view the screens of the installation wizard. 
oIf you will be using PuTTY, you will also need an X client on the machine from which you are 	connecting to the machine onto which you want to install Logger.Increasing the User Process Limit and the Maximum Number of Open Files
Before installing or upgrading Logger, you must increase the default user process limit while logged in as user root. This ensures that the system has adequate processing capacity.
To increase the default user process limit:
1. Open the file /etc/security/limits.d/-nproc.conf.
( is 90 for RHEL or CentOS 6.X and 20 for RHEL and CentOS 7.X.)l If you do not already have a /etc/security/limits.d/-nproc.conf file, create 	one (and the limits.d directory, if necessary).
l If the file already exists, delete all entries in the file.
2. Add the following lines:
*  soft  nproc  10240
*  hard  nproc  10240
*  soft  nofile  65536
*  hard  nofile  65536
Caution: Be sure to include the asterisk (*) in the new entries. It is important that you add all ofthe entries exactly as specified. Any omissions can cause system run-time errors.
3. Log out and log back in again.
4. Run the following command to verify the new settings: ulimit -a 
5. Verify that the output shows the following values for “open files” and “max user processes”:
open files  65536
max user processes 10240 
After you have increased the user process limit and met the other pre-requisites, you are ready to install Logger.Micro Focus Logger (7.0.1) 	Page 27 of 74
