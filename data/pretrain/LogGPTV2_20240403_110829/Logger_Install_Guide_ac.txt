#### Chapter 4: Installing Software Logger on Linux
You can install Software Logger on a Linux system or on a VMware virtual machine (VM). This chapter explains what you need to know to install and start running Software Logger on a Linux system. It includes information on the following topics:

- For information about installing Software Logger on a VMware VM, see "Installing Software Logger on VMware" on page 40.
- For initialization information about the Logger Appliance, see "Setting Up a Logger Appliance" on page 16.

#### Before You Begin
Ensure you meet the following prerequisites before installing the Logger software:
- **Supported Platform:** Ensure that you are installing Logger on a supported platform. Refer to the Release Notes and ArcSight Data Platform Support Matrix for this information. These documents are available for download on [Micro Focus Support Portal](#micro-focus-support-portal).
- **RHEL 7.X Configuration:** If you are installing on RHEL 7.X, edit the `logind.conf` file as described in "Editing the logind Configuration File for RHEL 7.X" on page 28.
- **User Process Limit:** Increase the user process limit on your Operating System as described in "Increasing the User Process Limit and the Maximum Number of Open Files" on the next page.
- **Time Zone Data:** Make sure that you have the latest supported `tzdata` rpm, `tzdata2019c`, installed on your OS before installing Logger.
- **License File:** Before deploying in a production environment, obtain a valid license file. If you do not have a license file, see "Acquiring a License for Software Logger" on the previous page. You may need a separate license file for each instance of Logger. A license file is uniquely generated for each download.
- **Non-Root User Account:** A non-root user account must exist on the system where you are installing Logger, or the installer will ask you to provide one. Even if you install as root, a non-root user account is still required. The `userid` and its primary `groupid` should be the same for this account. The `UID` for the non-root user should be 1500, and the `GID` should be 750. For example, to create the non-root user, run these commands as root:
  ```sh
  groupadd –g 750 arcsight
  useradd –m –g arcsight –u 1500 arcsight
  ```
  These commands create a non-root user named `arcsight` that will work with a Logger software installation.
- **Installation Directory Permissions:** Decide whether to install Logger while logged in as root or as a non-root user. Your installation options vary depending on which user you choose.
  - **Tip:** If you are installing as a non-root user, the user must have privileges to write to the installation directory and its sub-directories. For example, for the non-root user `arcsight`, use the command:
    ```sh
    chown -R arcsight:arcsight /opt/arcsight
    ```
  - **Root Installation:** If you install as root, you can choose to configure Logger to start as a service and select the port on which Logger listens for secure web connections.
  - **Non-Root Installation:** If you install as the non-root user, Logger can only listen for connections on port 9000/tcp. You cannot configure the port to a different value.
  - **Upgrade Considerations:** When upgrading, you cannot change a previous non-root installation to a root-user installation. You will need to use the previously configured port 9000/tcp for accessing Software Logger.
- **Empty Folder:** Install into an empty folder. If you have uninstalled Logger previously and are installing into the same location, ensure to remove any files that the uninstaller left in place.
- **Hostname:** The hostname of the machine on which you are installing Logger cannot be “localhost.” If it is, change the hostname before proceeding with the installation.
- **MySQL Installation:** Do not have an instance of MySQL installed on the machine where you install Logger. If an instance of MySQL exists on that machine, uninstall it before installing Logger.
- **Console Mode Installation:** If you are installing/uninstalling Logger in console mode with a non-root user, you must unset the `DISPLAY` environment variable by executing the following command:
  ```sh
  unset DISPLAY
  ```
- **GUI Mode Installation:** If you will be installing Logger over an SSH connection and want to use the GUI mode of installation, make sure that you have enabled X window forwarding using the `-X` option so that you can view the screens of the installation wizard. If you will be using PuTTY, you will also need an X client on the machine from which you are connecting to the machine onto which you want to install Logger.

#### Increasing the User Process Limit and the Maximum Number of Open Files
Before installing or upgrading Logger, you must increase the default user process limit while logged in as the root user. This ensures that the system has adequate processing capacity.

**To increase the default user process limit:**
1. Open the file `/etc/security/limits.d/-nproc.conf`.
   - For RHEL or CentOS 6.X, the file is `90-nproc.conf`.
   - For RHEL and CentOS 7.X, the file is `20-nproc.conf`.
   - If the file does not already exist, create it (and the `limits.d` directory, if necessary).
   - If the file already exists, delete all entries in the file.
2. Add the following lines:
   ```sh
   * soft nproc 10240
   * hard nproc 10240
   * soft nofile 65536
   * hard nofile 65536
   ```
   **Caution:** Be sure to include the asterisk (`*`) in the new entries. It is important that you add all of the entries exactly as specified. Any omissions can cause system run-time errors.
3. Log out and log back in again.
4. Run the following command to verify the new settings:
   ```sh
   ulimit -a
   ```
5. Verify that the output shows the following values for “open files” and “max user processes”:
   ```sh
   open files 65536
   max user processes 10240
   ```

After you have increased the user process limit and met the other prerequisites, you are ready to install Logger.

#### Editing the logind Configuration File for RHEL 7.X
Before installing or upgrading Logger on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7x, you must modify the inter-process communication (IPC) setting of the `logind.conf` file.

**To modify the `logind.conf` file for RHEL 7.X:**
1. Navigate to the `/etc/systemd` directory, and open the `logind.conf` file for editing.
2. Find the `RemoveIPC` line. Ensure that `RemoveIPC` is active and set to `no`.
   - Remove the `#` if it is there, and change `yes` to `no` if appropriate. The correct entry is:
     ```sh
     RemoveIPC=no
     ```
3. Save the file.
4. From the `/etc/systemd` directory, enter the following command to restart the `systemd-logind` service and put the change into effect:
   ```sh
   systemctl restart systemd-logind.service
   ```

After you have modified this setting and met the other prerequisites, you are ready to install Logger.
