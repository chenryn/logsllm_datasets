All of the projects I'm working on are mounted through SSHFS which will become
inaccessible as I move around places, and now that Atom attempts to load
previously opened tabs/folders on program startup, I almost always will see a
huge list of red warnings on the right side twice a day as I move from home to
office and office to home. It'd be great if we can add in an option to turn
this behavior off because it's not beneficial to me in this case.
