If you visited the previous URL, you should be notified that my domain is not indexed by their sendee. This is 
because I placed code within my site requesting the pages to be ignored by The Internet Archive’s indexing 
engine. However, this request is ignored by other providers. Archive.org is not the only sendee which provides 
archived domains.
I previously mentioned The Internet Archive and explained how it collects copies of websites over time. This is 
very’ useful when we need to see the ways in which a website has changed. This is especially true if our target 
domain is no longer online. The direct URL for a domain query at their service is as follows.
This sendee offers a "Time Travel" option which presents archives of a domain from several third-party 
providers. The following URL queries my own domain, which found 5 new archives.
This sendee also collects copies of websites and ignores all requests for deletion. My own site can be found at 
the following URL, which displays 183 captures dating back to 2013.

I am mostly interested in the screen capture available to the right of a search result Figure 23.04 (upper left) 
displays their capture of my site in May of 2019.
This option allows you to search by domain to discover ail publicly available content in the Library of Congress 
Web Archives. A direct URL is as follows.
https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:inteltechniques.com
I was surprised to see my site indexed here with 12 historic archives dating back to 2017. The query URL 
structure is as follows.
Similar to the previous option, this service provides very little valuable details. However, the screen captures are 
often unique. Figure 23.04 (upper right) displays a result from August of 2018.
While it may seem obvious, you should document the current visual representation of your target website. This 
may be a simple screen capture, but you may have advanced needs. When I am investigating a domain, I have 
three goals for visual documentation. I want documentation of the current site, any historical versions archived 
online, and then future monitoring for any changes. Previous chapters presented numerous methods for 
capturing live web pages and techniques for locating online archives. Let's briefly revisit these methods and then 
apply new resources.
These screen captures are in high resolution and current. Figure 23.04 (lower right) displays the result from my 
domain captured in August of 2019.
Searching your target domain within Google, Bing, and Yandex should present numerous results. The first is 
almost always the home page, and clicking the green down arrow usually presents a cached version of the page. 
This should be conducted first in order to identify any recent cached copies, as previously explained. In my 
experience, Google is going to possess the most recent cache, which can always be accessed via direct URL with 
the following structure.
The screen capture presented here was very similar to Website Informer, but it was cropped slightly different. 
This appears to be from May of 2019 and is seen in Figure 23.04 (lower left).

Any time you search a domain within this sen-ice, it should present a historical screen capture with a date of 
acquisition. We can also submit a direct URL query for this file. The following URL displays my own site.

DomainlQ provides numerous query options, similar to ViewDNS. Their historical snapshots are my favorite 
offering. Figure 23.05 displays the results for my domain. It presented seven unique views. More importantly.it 
disclosed die capture date, IP address, and host of each screenshot. In 2019, 1 used this senrice to expose a 
known domain which was suspected of being associated with an extortion case. The suspect quickly deleted the 
content before the investigation began. The site had not been indexed by the Wayback Machine, Google, Bing, 
or Yandex. However, DomainlQ possessed a single screen capture which clearly displayed inappropriate images 
of my client, which was captured several months earlier.

Figure 23.05: Several screen captures from DomainIQ.
This provided an estimated creation date of "2013-1 l-16T08:47:ll". Furthermore, it displayed multiple direct 
URLs to historical archives of my website within rhe Wayback Machine and other services. After checking these 
links and visiting any other archives at the Internet Archive, the following sendees fill in the gaps with screen 
captures from various dates.
This free service provides a summan’ of available online caches of a website, and displays an estimated site 
creation date based on the first available capture. The following static URL would be used to query’ my own 
domain.
Once you locate a website of interest, it can be time consuming to continually visit the site looking for any’ 
changes. With large sites, it is easy to miss the changes due to an enormous amount of content to analyze. This 
is when sites like Follow That Page come in handy. Enter the address of the target page of interest, as well as an 
email address where you can be reached. This sendee will monitor the page and send y’ou an email if anything 
changes. Anything highlighted is either new or modified content. Anything that has been stricken through 
indicates deleted text. Parents are encouraged to set-up and use these sendees to monitor their child's websites. 
It does not work well on some social networks such as Facebook, but can handle a public Twitter page fine.
fl '
If you found the sendee provided by Follow That Page helpful, but you arc seeking more robust options, you 
should consider Visual Ping. This modern Swiss website allows you to select a target domain for monitoring. 
Visual Ping will generate a current snapshot of the site and you can choose the level of monitoring. I recommend 
hourly monitoring and notification of any "tiny’ change". It will now check the domain hourly and email you if 
anything changes. If you are watching a website that contains advertisements or any’ dynamic data that changes 
often, you can select to avoid that portion of the page. Figure 23.06 displays the monitoring option for 
phonelosers.org. In this example, 1 positioned the selection box around the blog content of the main page. 1 
also chose the hourly’ inspection and the "Tiny Change" option. If anything changes within this selected area, 1 
will receive an email announcing the difference.

You may want to know about any malicious activity embedded into a target website. Blacklight displays this 
data. When querying cnn.com, 1 am notified of the following invasive activity.
Spy On Web is one of many sites that will search a domain name and identify the web server IP address and 
location. It also conducts a Whois query which will give you registration information of a website. More 
importantly, it identifies and cross-references website analytic data that it locates on a target domain. z\ search 
for the website phonelosers.org reveals a "Google AdSense" ID of ca-pub-3941709854725695. It further 
identifies five domains that are using the same Google zXdSense account for online advertising. This identifies 
an association between the target website and these new websites. We now know that whoever maintains 
phonelosers.org places ads on the page. We also know that those same ads and affiliate number is present on 
five domains. This means that our target likely maintains all of the following domains.
Domain analytics are commonly installed on websites in order to track usage information. This data often 
identifies the city and state from where a visitor is; details about the web browser the person is using, and 
keywords that were searched to find the site. Only the owner of the website can view this analytic data. Analytics 
search sendees determine rhe specific number assigned to the analytics of a website. If the owner of this website 
uses analytics to monitor other websites, the analytic number will probably be the same. These services will now 
conduct a reverse search of this analytic number to find other websites with the same number. In other words, 
it will search a website and find other websites that the same owner may maintain. .Additionally, it will try to 
identify user specific advertisements stored on one site that arc visible on others. It will reverse search this to 
identify even more websites that are associated with each other. None of this relies on Whois data. z\ couple of 
examples should simplify the process.
Previously, I explained how Hunter could be used to verify email addresses. This tool can also accept a domain 
name as a search term, and provides any email addresses that have been scraped from public web pages. The 
free version of this tool will redact a few letters from each address, but the structure should be identifiable.

Analyze ID (analyzeid.com)
Amazon product 1452876169
DomainlQ (domainiq.com/reverse_analydcs)
Hacker Target (hackertarget.com/reverse-analydcs-search)
This service stands out due to their immediate availability of historic analytics IDs across multiple subdomains. 
Consider a search of cnn.com. Hacker Target displayed dozens of associated Google IDs, such as the following.
cnnworldlive.cnn.com,UA-289507
center.cnn.com,UA-96063853
games.cnn.com,UA-74063330
www.notla.com
www.oldpeoplearefunny.com
www.phonelosers.com
www.phonelosers.org
We must first navigate to the URL of domainiq.eom/reverse_adsense#. We can enter any AdSense accounts 
identified with the previous options or ask DomainlQ to search a domain. I provided the ID of ca-pub- 
3941709854725695, which was identified earlier. The sendee immediately identified multiple domains sharing 
the same AdSense account. However, the biggest drawback of DomainlQ is that you are limited to three free 
searches per day. This is monitored by IP address. If you have a VPN, you could bypass this restriction by 
switching IPs.
This sendee sticks out from the pack a bit because it offers isolated search options. With the previous tools, you 
search a domain name and hope that the sendee can extract any analytics IDs and provide details about any 
online presence. DomainlQ is unique in that it provides designated pages for submission of any IDs located. As 
an example, I submitted the Google Analytics ID of UA-1946201-13 to the address above. This number was 
identified as associated with our target website while using Analyze ID. In this example, DomainlQ immediately 
identified the owner as notla.com. Unfortunately, all other details were redacted within the results page. 
Fortunately, we could see them in the exported CSV file. Directly above the redacted results is an icon labeled 
as CSV. Downloading that file revealed an IP address (74.208.175.23), name (Brad Carter) and email address 
(PI:EMAIL). Next, let's search for a Google AdSense ID.
Analyze ID also identified a Clickbank affiliate ID that was associated with five additional domains, one of 
which was unique to any other results. Spy On Web and Analyze ID have provided us several new pieces of 
information about our target. If you ever see an ID that starts with "UA-", this is likely an identifier for Google 
to monitor viewers of the website. Searching that number within these tools will also identify related websites. 
We should visit each website and analyze the content for any relevant evidence. After, we should consider other 
resources.
While Spy On Web is a strong overall analysis tool, there are additional options that should be checked for 
reverse analytics. Analyze ID performs the same type of query and attempts to locate any other domains that 
share the same analytics or advertisement user numbers as your target This will provide new websites related to 
your target. During a search of phonelosers.org, it identified the Google AdSense ID previously mentioned. It 
also revealed an Amazon Affiliate ID of phonelosersof-20 and an Amazon product ID of 1452876169. These 
are likely present because the target sells books through his websites and receives compensation from Amazon 
through customer purchases. These new pieces of information can be very valuable. Clicking the Amazon 
Affiliate ID presents the five domains that possess that same code. The Amazon product ID displays the seven 
websites that also advertise a specific product. When you encounter this type of data, consider the following 
Google search. It identifies the actual product that the target is selling within embedded ads. This search reveals 
that the product is the target's self-published book titled Phone Losers of America.

We could search these IDs through this or other sites to track additional associated domains.

you should consider searching this number through Nerdy Data. A search of our t““—3’" AJC—

Most target websites will possess an SSL certificate which allows for a secure connection through HTTPS. The 
history of these certificates can be quite lucrative. Consider my own domain through a free service called 
CRT.sh (ertsh) through a direct URL of https://crt.sh/?q=inteltechniques.com. Most of the data identifies 
various certificate updates which do not provide any valuable information. However, through the history you 
can see that I once purchased a group SSL certificate from GoDaddy. Clicking on any of these entries displays 
the other domains I secured with this option, including dates of activity, as follows. This identifies other domains 
to investigate.
Nerdy Data is a search engine that indexes the source code of websites. I use this to locate websites which steal 
the source code of my search tools and present them as their own. In one example, I searched "function 
doSearch01(Search01)", which is the JavaScript I use within the search tools. Nerdy Data immediately identified 
a competitor's website which was selling access to my scripts.
Every website possesses valuable information "under the hood" within its source code. We should always search 
within this code and understand the various technologies used to create the site. For this, I rely on the following 
services.
The final analytics option I offer is DNSLytics. Enter the analytics ID found with any of the previous techniques 
and you may find associations not present within other options. The two direct URL options follow.

A quick analysis of a target website may identify the technologies used to build and maintain it. Many pages that 
are built in an environment such as WordPress or Tumblr often contain obvious evidence of these technologies. 
If you notice the YouTube logo within an embedded video, you will know that the creator of the site likely has 
an account within the video service. However, the presence of various services is not always obvious. Built With 
takes the guesswork out of this important discovery.
ftp.phonelosers.org
www.phonelosers.org
Entering the domain of phonelosers.org into the Built With search immediately identifies the web server 
operating system (Linux), email provider (DreamHost), web framework (PHP, WordPress), WordPress plugins, 
website analytics, video services, mailing list provider, blog environment, and website code functions. While 
much of this is geek speak that may not add value to your investigation, some of it will assist in additional search 
options through other networks. Another option for this type of search is Stats Crop (statscrop.com).
I have never found a result on this page which was 
be in our arsenal in case of any outages.
We now know that this domain possesses a webmail server, SSH connection, FTP server, and mail server. This 
method has helped me locate "hidden” pages which contain several forum messages from users of the site.
This unique tool performs several tasks that will attempt to locate hidden pages on a domain. First it performs 
a DNS zone transfer which will often fail. It will then use a list of numerous common subdomain names and 
attempt to identify any that are present. If any are located, it will note the IP address assigned to that subdomain 
and will scan all 254 IP addresses in that range. In other words, it will attempt to identify new areas of a website 
that may not be visible from within the home page. The following example may help to clarify.
A subdomain is a domain that is a part of another domain. For example, if a domain offered an online store as 
part of their website example.com/shop.html, they might use a subdomain of shop.example.com. A subdomain 
finder is a tool which performs an advanced scan over the specified domain and tries to find as many subdomains 
as possible. This often discloses interesting evidence otherwise not visible within the main page. I rely on several 
tools.
The website at phonelosers.org is a blog that appears to have no further content to be analyzed. Searching for 
it on Pentest-Tools provides additional intelligence. It identifies the following subdomains present on the web 
server:
number revealed five domains that possess the same data. The search of the Amazon number revealed three 
domains. If this service presents more results than you can manage, consider using their free file download
