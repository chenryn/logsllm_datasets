I seems that form:checkboxes and form:radiobuttons are still broken. They
still use toString and not the registered property editor to generate the
value.
form:select works properly, and form:checkboxes and form:radiobuttons should
work just like it.
For example:
The above works great. path="interests" is the complete set of things a person
may be interested in and items="${interests}" are the set of things the given
person is interested in.
However, checkboxes and radiobuttons like so:
does not work. Specifically, if I leave itemValue blank, the values are
correctly bound and the right ones checked, but the tag uses toString to
generate the value instead of calling the property editor, so when I save of,
course, the property editor can't convert the value (unless my toString method
returns the same thing as my custom property editor, which is not a good
solution).
If I do itemValue="id", the values are not properly bound (the right check
boxes are not checked.
The same issue is true with the single versions form:checkbox and
form:radiobutton.
The above would work if the tag used the registered property editor to
generate the value, but instead it uses toString (and again, if your toString
returns the same thing as your property editor, it works).
This issue relates to these other issues.
