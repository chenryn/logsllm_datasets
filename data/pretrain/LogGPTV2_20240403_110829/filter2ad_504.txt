Message from the DCCS Program Chair 
Welcome  to  DCCS  2013  –  this  is  a  fantastic  time  to  work  on  dependability.    Everyday  life  has  become 
inherently dependent on computerized networked systems whose complexity is rapidly growing. Providing 
resilience  to  malicious  attacks,  accidental  faults,  design  errors,  and  unexpected  operating  conditions  is 
therefore  becoming  simultaneously  more  important  and  more  challenging.  If  these  systems  are  unreliable, 
insecure  or  untrustworthy,  significant  harm  can  result,  and  users  will  abandon  them,  thus  squandering 
opportunities for progress. 
The  Dependable  Computing  and  Communications  Symposium  (DCCS)  brings  together  academic  and 
industrial  researchers  in  all  aspects  of  dependability  and  security.    We  present  the  very  best  work  on  all 
aspects of the research and practice of creating, validating, deploying, and maintaining systems to achieve 
dependability and  security.   All  aspects  of  dependable systems  are  covered,  ranging  from  VLSI  and  CPU 
architecture,  at  the  bottom  of  the  stack,  all  the  way  up  through  operating  systems,  networks,  application 
software, and human factors.  With this comprehensive coverage of dependability and security as the core 
theme of DCCS, the technical program of DCCS '13 provides a cutting edge view of the state of the art and 
practice in this key and ever expanding area of computing. 
I would like to thank all the researchers and practitioners who submitted papers – those whose papers were 
accepted  and  also  those  whose  weren’t  –  for  making  DCCS  '13  a  great  conference.    We  have  a  program 
comprised of 21 papers, reflecting a highly selective acceptance rate of 19.6%.  The program was selected by 
an  outstanding  program  committee  that  worked  extremely  hard:  469  reviews,  several  days  of  online 
deliberations, and in full-day PC meeting, with members flying in from around the world to attend. This level 
of dedication to providing service deserves the community’s sincere thanks and gratitude. 
The  review  process  was  very  rigorous.  Paper  reviewing  was  double-blind,  with  none  of  the  PC  members 
knowing  author  names  or  affiliations.    Each  paper  submitted  received  at  least  three  PC  member  reviews.  
Papers  selected  for  a  second  review  round  received  multiple  additional  reviews.  All  authors  had  the 
opportunity to submit author comments, and the comments were reviewed by PC members for every paper 
(including those which did not progress to the second round).  During the PC meeting, every paper with at 
least  one  PC  member  supporting  acceptance  was  discussed  in  depth.    Whenever  papers  with  potential 
conflicts of interest came up, all the potentially conflicted PC members were excluded from the discussion.  I 
would like to personally thank Prof. Saurabh Bagchi for coordinating the review process of papers for which 
I had a potential conflict of interest, thus allowing even the PC chair to not be excepted from the double-blind 
process. 
I deeply appreciate the efforts of the General Chair (András Pataricza) and his team, the support from the 
steering committee led by Neeraj Suri and Rick Schlichting, and the tremendous help I received from DCCS's 
most recent PC chairs, Saurabh Bagchi and Philip Koopman. Finally, I want to thank my graduate students 
for  their  logistical  support  (including  developing  new  software  for  runing  the  PC  meeting)  that  made  the 
paper selection so much more efficient and smooth. 
I hope you enjoy the program !
