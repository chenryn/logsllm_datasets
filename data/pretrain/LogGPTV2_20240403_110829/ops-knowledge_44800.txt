User: Python 2.7 has two different disk image installers for Mac OS X. My questions are:

What are the differences between the two Python 2.7 disk image installers?


Python 2.7 32-bit Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.3 through 10.6
Python 2.7 PPC/i386/x86-64 Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.5 or later

If running Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard without the 64-bit kernel and extensions, which is the more appropriate version of Python 2.7 to install?
Why are there two different Mac OS X disk image installers for Python 2.7 when Python 2.6.5 and Python 3.2 each only have one?
Does the first listed installer support PPC? Strange that it wouldn't if it support back to Mac OS X 10.3, but unlike the second installer PPC isn't listed.
Assistant: Looks like all the other versions only have a 32 bit port? So a "new feature" of 2.7 is a 64 bit port. If you aren't running a 64 bit OS and don't need programs that can use > 4 GB of ram, you can stick with the 32 bit.
