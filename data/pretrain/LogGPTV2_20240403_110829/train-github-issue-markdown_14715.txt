  * VSCode Version: 1.1.1
  * OS Version: 10
Steps to Reproduce:
  1. Install VS Code.
  2. Install one or more extensions.
  3. Notice that there is a `.vscode` folder in your user directory.
In Windows, the root of the user directory is _NOT_ the right place to store
application settings. This is a very common convention in Linux but Windows !=
Linux and not all Windows users want to pretend they are running Linux. In
windows the correct location for application settings is `%APPDATA%` and the
correct location for extensions is `%LOCALAPPDATA%` or `%PROGRAMDATA%`
(depending on level of security consciousness).
To avoid a flame war, I want to be clear that this issue isn't debating _why_
`C:/Users//.` is the wrong place for these files, it is
only asserting that Microsoft has very clearly documented the _right_ place
for settings files and VSCode does not follow it. If the authors of VSCode
have consciously decided to go against the long-running convention established
by the OS authors then I won't press on the issue (though I think that would
be a silly decision for VSCode). I am submitting this issue under the
assumption that the authors didn't realize there was an established convention
(very common in open source projects) and did what was familiar to them.
