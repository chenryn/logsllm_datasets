#### Findings from Mila Sample Set
- **Identification**: Our analysis identified 8 major APT taskforces.
- **Exploits**: Around 12 different CVEs and exploits were identified.
- **Malware Usage**: Even though APT taskforces use 8-9 different exploits, the type of malware is limited to a few.
- **Analysis Basis**: APT taskforces are identified based on C&C server location and malware used. The exploit used is not very related to our analysis.

#### Language and C&C Server Locations
- **Language**:
  - 24% of samples are from China
  - 3.9% of samples are from Korea
  - Some samples are from Russia and France

- **Top 3 C&C Server Locations**:
  - Taiwan (28%)
  - US
  - Hong Kong (HK is another CnC haven)

#### Additional Case Study
- **Target Attack Mail Signed**:
  - COMODO signed and verified
  - '100620.pdf' belongs to a newly discovered APT Taskforce in 2011
  - Malware is a known family, similar to APT-Group-B

#### APT Threat Landscape
- **APT Characteristics**:
  - Organized and planned cyber espionage activities targeting high-value targets like political, economic, high-tech, and military entities.
  - Primarily uses targeted malicious emails with various Zero-Day Exploits and custom RATs.
  - Traditional security devices cannot detect and defend against APT attacks.

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Implement robust security policies, physical isolation, and strict USB usage policies.
  - Continuous collection and analysis of threat intelligence are essential for effective defense.
  - Regional analysis shows that APT activities are most prevalent in Asia, with Taiwan, the US, and Hong Kong being the top three regions.

#### Conclusion
- **APT Threat**: APTs are organized and planned cyber espionage activities targeting high-value assets. Although a new term, these threats have existed for years.
- **Detection Challenges**: Traditional security measures are insufficient to detect and defend against APTs.
- **Regional Analysis**: APT activities are most concentrated in Asia, with Taiwan, the US, and Hong Kong being the top three regions.
