User: According to the following requirements, a Docker-based application deployment and management solution is provided to ensure high availability and elastic scalability of applications. A web application needs to be deployed, with about 1 million visits per day, and it is necessary to ensure that the application is stable and available under high concurrency conditions. At the same time, it needs to support rapid horizontal expansion to cope with traffic growth.
Assistant: Docker-based application deployment and management solution is as follows: 1. Prepare a Docker image: package the web application into a Docker image, and ensure that the configuration and dependencies of the application are included in the image. You can use Dockerfile to create images; 2. Deploy Docker containers: use tools such as Docker Compose or Docker Swarm to manage and deploy containers. Start multiple instances to provide high availability, and use a load balancer to distribute traffic to multiple instances; 3. Monitoring and automatic scaling: use Docker's own health check function or third-party monitoring tools (such as Prometheus) to monitor container health Running status, when there is a failure or the load is too high, the number of instances will be automatically expanded horizontally. Automatic scaling and management can be done using container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes. Through this Docker-based application deployment and management solution, web applications can be deployed quickly and reliably, and can be elastically expanded under high load and traffic growth conditions, ensuring high availability and scalability of applications.
