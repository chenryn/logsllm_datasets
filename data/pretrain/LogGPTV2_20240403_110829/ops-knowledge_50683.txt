User: I am new to python.I Have a python script for copying files from local machine to sftp location.The script will use the wxpython,pycrypto and ssh modules of python.I created an exe file by using the pyinstaller.My machine is windows 7 64-bit.I used pyinstaller 2.1 and python 2.7.6.amd 64 for creating the exe file.It's working fine in windows 7 64-bit.But it's not working in xp,win7 32-bit.In linux i used wine for executing this exe but there also it's not working.
Then i created one more exe in windows7 32-bit machine.this exe is working fine in win7 32 and 64 bit versions.but it's not working in xp.
Can anyone tell me what cpuld be the reason and how to resolve it.
I want one installer which can be installed in windows or linux.
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: Pyinstaller does not allow cross compilation. so if you want to have an executable file you should compile your project first in Linux OS and then you may use wine in which you can compile the project to have the windows executable
