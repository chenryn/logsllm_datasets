User: I have two versions of Python on Windows and want to use them through cmd. I tried to make shortcuts of their python.exe and renaming them to python26 and python33 (I also added their locations to PATH), but unfortunately this does not work. Calling python26 or python26.lnk outputs in not recognized as an internal command.
Is there any other way to do it (like Linux virtualenv), or I missed something in my idea ?
Assistant: You could also work with Windows path:

set path=C:\Python26;.;..;C:\windows;C:\windows\system32
prompt $ & start title Python26

Save this as Py26.bat and type Python in the screen that displays

set path=C:\Python33;.;..;C:\windows;C:\windows\system32
prompt $ & start title Python33

Save this as Py33.bat and type Python in the screen that displays
