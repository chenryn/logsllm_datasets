### Image Resizing and Metadata Stripping on Hosting Sites

#### Image Resizing
Hosting sites often compress and resize images to several standard sizes. For example, Instagram uses a 640x640 pixel size for most of its hosted photos. Other sites, such as Flickr, confine the longest side of an image to a set of specific values: 100 pixels, 240 pixels, 800 pixels, 1600 pixels, and so on. If the majority of photos on a site have their longest side (width or height) falling into a small set of numbers, it is likely that the site resizes the photos.

To determine if a site resizes its photos, we analyzed the longest side length of each photo in our dataset. Approximately 2% of the photos had no image size information and were excluded from the analysis. We identified the most frequently occurring longest side length value, denoted as "DDDD," and calculated the proportion of photos with this value. If over 50% of the photos on a site had the longest side length of "DDDD," we concluded that the site resizes its photos.

Figure 6 illustrates the percentage of sites that resize photos across seven categories. Notably, only 3.0% of college sites and 10.5% of government sites resize their photos, as these institutions typically have sufficient resources to store high-resolution images. About 36.7% of news sites are estimated to resize their photos, but this percentage may be lower due to the variety of sizes used. In the other four categories—social networking, weblogs, classifieds, and shopping—over 50% of sites resize their photos, likely to save storage space. Overall, at least one-third of all sites in our dataset resize their photos. Our results represent a lower bound of the percentage of sites that resize their photos.

#### Metadata Stripping
Another concern when uploading photos online is whether the hosting site strips out metadata information, such as camera make and model. For each site, we calculated the percentage of photos containing metadata. Since some users may remove metadata before uploading, our estimate represents an upper bound.

Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the percentage of photos containing metadata on each of the 611 sites across seven categories. Approximately 16% of sites have no photos with metadata, suggesting they strip out metadata. About 45% of sites have at least half of their photos containing metadata. We determined that a site removes metadata if none of its hosted photos contain it; otherwise, the site preserves the metadata.

Figure 8 displays the percentage of sites in each category that preserve metadata. College and government sites show significantly different characteristics, with 98% of college sites and 93.7% of government sites preserving metadata. In the other five categories, the proportions range between 40% and 60%. On average, up to 68.4% of top sites in the seven categories preserve metadata, indicating that many online photos may still have their metadata accessible to the public.

### Re-identification Attack Using Camera Serial Numbers

Metadata fields, such as geolocation and owner's information, can pose privacy risks. However, even seemingly innocuous metadata, like camera serial numbers, can be exploited for re-identification attacks.

A camera serial number, which is unique within a camera brand, can identify a camera. All photos taken with the same digital camera should have the same serial number. A single photo with a camera serial number can be used to trace other photos taken with the same camera, facilitating the identification of the photographer.

We used the stolencamerafinder database to search for photos tagged with a given camera serial number. This service, originally designed to help find stolen cameras, returns a list of photos and their URLs. In our experiment, about 12% of the photos in the GoogleImage and TopSitesPhoto sets contained serial numbers. We selected 2,000 unique serial numbers and searched them in stolencamerafinder, obtaining results for 1,037 serial numbers. This yielded 38,140 photos posted on 4,712 unique websites.

Figure 9 shows the CDF of the number of photos linked to a single serial number. About 30% of serial numbers link to over 25 photos, and 10% link to over 100 photos. The average number of photos per serial number is 36.8, with a median of 10 and a maximum of 923. With a significant number of photos and their URLs, we can create a knowledge base for each serial number, revealing more privacy information than just the serial number alone. This demonstrates the potential of camera serial numbers as a privacy attack vector.
