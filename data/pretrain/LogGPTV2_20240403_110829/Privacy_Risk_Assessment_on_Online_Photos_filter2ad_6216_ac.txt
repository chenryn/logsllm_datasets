ically compressed and resized by the hosting site in several sizes. For instance,
Instagram uses an image size of 640 pixels in width and 640 pixels in height for
nearly all its hosted photos. More commonly, an online site conﬁnes a photo’s
longest side length to a small set of values. Flickr resizes its photos in the fol-
lowing sizes: 100 pixels (on the longest side), 240 pixels, 800 pixels, 1600 pixels
and so on [10]. Therefore, if the majority of photos hosted by a site have their
longest side (width or height) lengths falling into a small set of numbers, then
we speculate that the site does resize the photos it hosts.
For each photo in our dataset, we retrieved its longest side length from its
ﬁle information. About 2 % of photos had no image size information available
and were ruled out. Suppose “DDDD” is the longest side length value that is
observed most frequently on a site. We calculated the proportion of the photos on
the site with their longest side length of the value “DDDD”. We then leveraged
the proportion number to decide whether the site resizes its photos or not. If
over 50 % of photos on the site have the longest side length of “DDDD”, the
site is considered to resize its photos. The argument is based on our observation
that among more than 40,000 photos downloaded from Flickr with “original
size” option, only 3.47 % have their longest side length of 1,600 pixels, while this
length value occurs much more frequently for the photos that have been resized.
Figure 6 shows what percentage of sites that are regarded to resize the pho-
tos on their sites across the 7 categories. It is not surprising to see that only
3.0 % of “College” sites and 10.5 % “Government” sites have resized their pho-
tos, since colleges and governments usually have suﬃcient hosting resources to
store high-resolution photos. About 36.7 % of “News” sites are estimated to
resize the photos they host. A close examination reveals that news sites often
resize their photos to many diﬀerent sizes, which thereby lowers the percentage
of photos with a unique longest side length size. In reality, there are probably

much more news sites that resize their photos. In each of the other four cate-
gories, “Social networking,” “Weblog,” “Classiﬁed,” and “Shopping,” over 50 %
of sites have resized the photos they host. The sites in those categories often con-
tain large amounts of photos and resizing photos is an eﬀective means to save
valuable storage space. Irrespective of categories, at least one third of all sites
in our dataset are regarded to resize the photos they host. Note that our results
represent a lower bound of the percentage of sites that resize their photos.
Whether a Site Strips Out the Metadata Information Embedded in
the Photos it Hosts? There is another issue people may be concerned about
when they upload photos online. As mentioned before, we use two ﬁelds in the
metadata—camera make and model—to determine if the metadata information
exists or not. For each site in our dataset, we calculated the percentage of its
photos containing metadata information. Note that a photo may have its meta-
data information erased by its owner before posted online. Thus, our estimated
percentage of online sites that strip out the metadata information of the photos
they host represents an upper bound.
Figure 7 shows the CDF of the percentage of photos containing metadata
information on each of the 611 sites in the seven categories. About 16 % of sites
have no photos containing metadata information. It is highly probable that those
sites remove the metadata information from all hosted photos. About 45 % of
total sites have at least half of their hosted photos containing metadata infor-
mation. We determine that a site adopts a policy of removing photo metadata
information if no photos hosted by the site contain metadata information; oth-
erwise, the site is considered to preserve the metadata information of photos it
hosts.
Figure 8 shows the percentage of sites in each category which are estimated
to preserve the metadata information of photos they host. Again we found that
the two categories “College” and “Government” present quite diﬀerent statistical
characteristics in preserving the photo metadata than the rest ﬁve categories.
Speciﬁcally, 98 % of college sites and 93.7 % of government sites are estimated to

preserve the photo metadata information. Combined with the above estimation
results on a site’s photo resizing policy, we draw the conclusion that college and
government sites seldom resize the photos they host or remove the embedded
photo metadata information. In each of the other ﬁve categories, the proportions
of the sites that preserve the photo metadata information are between 40 % and
60 %, much lower than those of college and government sites. On average, up to
68.4 % of the top sites in the seven categories preserve the photo metadata
information, which suggests that a number of online photos may still have their
metadata information open to public access for years.
6 Re-identiﬁcation Attack
Except the sensitive metadata ﬁelds including geolocation, owner’s information,
and modiﬁcation history, other metadata ﬁelds may appear relatively innocent.
However, in this section, we demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting a trivial
looking metadata ﬁeld for re-identiﬁcation attack.
Even without the photographer information explicitly included, a photogra-
pher can still be identiﬁed based on even only one photo she ever took. This
can happen through a new attack vector—the camera serial number ﬁeld in the
photo metadata. A camera serial number can uniquely identify a camera most
of the time.4 All photos taken with a same digital camera are supposed to have
the same serial number if provided.5 In theory, a single photo with a camera
serial number embedded could be used to trace other online photos taken with
the same camera. Those photos together facilitate identifying the photographer.
We ﬁgured out that a public online database stolencameraﬁnder [3] could be
leveraged to search for online photos tagged with a given camera serial number,
although the online service was established to help ﬁnd stolen cameras. For each

model, a serial number can uniquely identify a camera.

given serial number, stolencameraﬁnder returns a list of online photos taken with
the same camera, and for each photo provides the page URL where the photo is
posted and the image URL linking to the photo.
Next, we do experiments to prove it quite easy to identify a photo owner
with only one photo she ever shared online in the case that the photo has a
camera serial number embedded. About 12 % of the “wild” photos in the two
sets GoogleImage and TopSitesPhoto were found to contain the serial number
information. We randomly selected 2,000 unique serial numbers from them, then
manually searched each serial number in the stolencameraﬁnder, and ﬁnally got
back search results for 1,037 serial numbers in total. Note that not every camera
serial number could get search results back. For those 1,037 serial numbers, by
following the image URLs returned, we collected 38,140 photos that were posted
on 4,712 unique websites. The photos collected for a speciﬁc serial number only
represent a subset of all photos available online and tagged with the same serial
number, due to the impossibility of ﬁnding all online photos with a given serial
number.
Figure 9 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the number of
photos that a single serial number links to. About 30 % of serial numbers link to
over 25 photos and about 10 % link to over 100 photos. The average number of
photos linked to a same serial number is 36.8, the median is 10, and the maximum
is 923. With the considerable number of photos tagged with a same camera
serial number, together with the page URLs where the photos are posted, and
the photos already existing in the photo sets GoogleImage and TopSitesPhoto,
we were able to set up a knowledge base for each serial number (tentatively
a digital camera). The rich information available can evidently disclose much
more privacy information about the camera owner than a single serial number
itself. This demonstrates the potential of a camera serial number as an attractive
attack vector for mounting privacy attacks.
