I feel like the previous issue #12392 was locked without explaining why. What
is wrong with this piece of code when edited into the project? If nothing I
would be happy to create a pull request.
    .btn-group-justified {
        &> .btn {
            border-right-width: 0px;
        }
        &> .btn:last-child {
            border-right-width: 1px;
        }
        &> .btn:hover + .btn, .btn:focus + .btn {
            /* Bootstrap sass mixins/_buttons L18 and _buttons L58*/
            border-left-color: darken($btn-default-border, 12%);
        }
        &> .btn:active + .btn, .btn.active + .btn {
            /* Bootstrap sass _theme L49 and L63*/
            border-left-color: darken($btn-default-bg, 14%);
        }
    }
I understand @cvrebert might have had good reasons to lock the previous issue,
I didn't understand them though. Would you be so kind to leave this one
unlocked for me to give a reaction?
