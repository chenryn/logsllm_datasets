User: Cassandra works in cluster model with 3 nodes.When all nodes are "UP", I use cql “select * from User” in cqlsh，Cassandra returns the right result.But after a node is dead,when I use "select" again,no result returns but reports:"Unable to complete request: one or more nodes were unavailable" .
I turned to use cassandra-cli command:"get Users", it returns me the right data without any error.
any ideas?
Assistant: cqlsh and cli both default to CL.ONE.  I suspect the difference is actually that your cqlsh query says "select all the users" while a "get" in the cli is "select exactly one user."
