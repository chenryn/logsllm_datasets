### Summary of the Log Chunk

This log chunk, spanning from 18:05:33 to 18:05:43 on October 18, documents a series of repeated warnings related to lease renewal and address changes in a Hadoop environment. The key points are:

1. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` process (running as `msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`) is failing to renew the lease for the client `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`.
   - The failure duration increases progressively from 36 seconds to 45 seconds over the 10-minute period.
   - Each failure is followed by a message indicating that the system will retry shortly.

2. **Address Change Detection**:
   - The `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client` component is repeatedly detecting an address change.
   - The old address is `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000`, and the new address is `msra-sa-41:9000`.
   - This address change detection occurs every second, coinciding with the lease renewal attempts.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Warnings**:
  - The log entries are timestamped, showing the exact time of each warning.
  - Each warning is at the `WARN` level, indicating a potential issue but not a critical error.

- **Process and Component**:
  - The process ID is `LeaseRenewer:msrabi@msra-sa-41:9000`.
  - The relevant software components are `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer` and `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`.

- **Lease Renewal Attempts**:
  - The lease renewal failures are consistent and occur every second.
  - The system indicates it will retry the lease renewal, suggesting a transient issue or network instability.

- **Address Changes**:
  - The address change from `msra-sa-41/10.190.173.170:9000` to `msra-sa-41:9000` is detected every second.
  - This could be due to a configuration change, network reconfiguration, or a DNS resolution issue.

### Conclusion

The log indicates a recurring issue with lease renewal for a specific DFS client, coupled with frequent address changes. This pattern suggests a possible network or configuration problem that needs to be investigated to ensure stable operation of the Hadoop cluster.
