User:  server application generates a large number of log files every hour, and needs to realize automatic log file segmentation and compression. Please provide the log management solution of the server application.
Assistant: 1. Use log rotation tools: You can use open source log rotation tools such as logrotate, cronolog, and rotatelogs to periodically compress and delete log files to avoid generating too many log files. 2. Set the size limit of the log file: By configuring the size limit of the log file, the file will be automatically divided every time it reaches a certain size. This can ensure that the size of a single log file will not be too large, which is convenient for management and maintenance. 3. Log classification management: For different log types, they can be stored in different directories for management. In this way, it is more convenient to perform operations such as archiving and backup of different types of logs. 4. Log level setting: You can set the log level, and output logs of different levels to different files, which is convenient for filtering and management. 5. Real-time monitoring and alarming: Monitor log changes in real time through monitoring tools. When abnormalities or errors occur, alarm notifications are sent to administrators in time to avoid serious problems.
