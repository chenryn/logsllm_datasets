If the user waits for few minutes before giving pageoffset to get more results
then user is getting duplicated results .This happens as the pageoffset we use
for pagination becomes invalid due to merging of druid segments and search
starts from offset 0 in new segment. Is there any way to know the pageoffset
is valid or not
