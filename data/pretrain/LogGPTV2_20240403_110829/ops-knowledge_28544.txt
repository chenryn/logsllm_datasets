Assistant: This log chunk shows the QuorumCnxManager software component attempting to establish connections with other nodes. It begins by interrupting the SendWorker thread three times, then receives connection requests from four different nodes. It then interrupts the SendWorker thread multiple times, and receives more connection requests from four different nodes. Finally, it interrupts the SendWorker thread one last time before receiving two more connection requests.
