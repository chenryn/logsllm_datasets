**ATT&CK ID:** T1546.009  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** AppCert DLLs

Adversaries may use AppCert DLLs to establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious code. When a dynamic-link library (DLL) is specified in the `AppCertDLLs` Registry key, located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\`, it is loaded into every process that calls one of the following commonly used application programming interface (API) functions: `CreateProcess`, `CreateProcessAsUser`, `CreateProcessWithLogonW`, `CreateProcessWithTokenW`, or `WinExec`.

By injecting their malicious DLL into these processes, attackers can ensure that their code is executed whenever any of the aforementioned API functions are called, thereby maintaining persistence and potentially elevating their privileges on the system.
