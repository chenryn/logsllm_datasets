by **PI:EMAIL** :
    What steps will reproduce the problem?
    1. Execute .pkg installer for Go v1.1.2 (on a machine with v.1.1.1 installed and working)
    2. Installer fails with error but no explanation
    3. OS X console shows message: "You have not agreed to the Xcode license
    agreements, please run 'xcodebuild -license' ..."
    'xcodebuild -license' resolves the issue, but the installer does not suggest this may be
    the problem. Additionally this install was on a machine that had Go v.1.1.1 installed
    via the .pkg without any problems, and no Xcode updates had been applied since.
    Which operating system are you using?
    OS X 10.8.4
    Which version are you using?  (run 'go version')
    go version go1.1.2 darwin/amd64
    Please provide any additional information below.
    A message with the cause of the install failure would make locating the issue much
    easier.
