adds negligible or unperceivable delay to the caller, other
than the typical time to connect and time waiting for the
recipient to answer the phone.
Permissive-for-VoIP-Callers The
technique would not
restrict any legitimate calls that use VoIP service. For
instance, some outbound-only VoIP users (such as Skype)
tend to have a generic (or unavailable) caller ID number
and cannot receive incoming PSTN calls.

conﬁgured to call again later if the call was not answered
by a human, or to deliver the audio message into the
recipient’s voicemail.
B. Deployability Criteria
Negligible-Changes-to-Infrastructure The technique requires
zero or negligible changes to existing PSTN protocols,
terminals, or infrastructure.
No-Third-Party-Involvement The technique does not require
a third-party. A compromise of the third-party would not
result in mishandled calls or in a breach of privacy.
Low-Resource-Requirement The technique is lightweight
and does not require a signiﬁcant amount of resources (e.g.,
people, equipment, engineering, or funding) to initiate and
deploy.
Low-Maintenance The technique requires low maintenance,
in terms of administrative cost,
to
maintain good working order.
resources,
time, or
Negligible-Cost-per-Call The technique adds negligible
cost to each call, taxed on the legitimate caller, recipient,
third-party, or carriers. The cost could also be indirect, such
as reduced efﬁciency or capacity.

Effective-Against-Unavailable-Caller-ID The
is robust even when the spammer makes the caller ID
unavailable or sends a faulty caller ID to cause errors.
Effective-Against-Multiple-Identities The technique is robust
even when the spammer initiate calls from multiple sources,
such as using multiple subscriber accounts or a telephone
botnet, to disseminate spam calls. This is different from
caller ID spooﬁng where the caller IDs are not necessarily
spoofed but are instead initiated from different sources.
The
Effective-Against-Answering-Machine-Detection
technique is robust even when the spammer uses Answering
Machine Detection technology, which is a feature in
autodialers that can distinguish human pick-ups from
answering machines. With AMD, an autodialer can be
Effective-Against-Dynamic-Audio-Content The technique is
robust even when the spammer uses an autodialer capable
of personalizing or altering the audio messages for different
recipients. This is usually featured in autodialers that are
able to synthesize text to speech.
We evaluate each technique using the criteria proposed in
Section V, and Table I visually summarizes this evaluation.
Each technique is evaluated as either satisfying the criteria
(denoted as (cid:2)), may satisfy the criteria (denoted as (cid:3)(cid:4)), or
not satisfying the criteria (denoted as (cid:4)). “May satisfy the
criteria” means that the technique can be made to satisfy the
criteria depending on the implementation or conﬁguration,
while some implementations do not fully satisfy the criteria.
Of course, this analysis requires some opinion, and in each
case we evaluated each technique and criteria to the best
of our abilities. While others may disagree with the exact
assessment of each technique, we believe that the criteria
outlined in Section V will help to guide future telephone
spam defenses and to provide a framework to evaluate these
defenses.
VI. COMBINING TECHNIQUES
From analyzing all the standalone techniques, it is clear
that there is no single technique that can satisfy all the
criteria. Therefore, an improved anti-spam system would
look to combine different
to leverage the
positives and compensate the negatives. We outline the
different ways in which a solution could use a combination
of standalone techniques.
techniques,
Phased Decisions combine several techniques into a linear
sequence (i.e., a pipeline process) of decision stages. If
an earlier technique determines the call is spam, then it
may not be necessary to run the evaluation techniques
at later stages. This is suitable for combining techniques
that uses information that are obtained chronologically,
such as ﬁrst using Call Request Header Analysis, followed
by Voice Interactive Screening. We found use of Phased
Decisions approach in related works by Niccolini and
Quitek et al. [96], [97], Schlegel et al. [98], Gritzalis and
Mallios [99], [100], and Azad and Morla [39].
Weighted Scoring combines several techniques by running
each technique individually and then combining the outputs
to produce a ﬁnal score by applying a weighted scoring
method. The classiﬁcation of whether the call
is spam
is based on the ﬁnal score. As Weighted Scoring need
to collect outputs from all standalone techniques,
is
suitable for combining techniques that can be performed
