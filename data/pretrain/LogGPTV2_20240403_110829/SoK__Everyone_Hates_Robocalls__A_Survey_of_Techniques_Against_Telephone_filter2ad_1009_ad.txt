### Impact on Caller Experience
- **Negligible Delay**: The technique introduces minimal or imperceptible delay to the caller, beyond the typical connection time and waiting period for the recipient to answer.

### Permissive Criteria
- **Permissive for VoIP Callers**: The method does not impede legitimate calls using VoIP services. For example, some outbound-only VoIP users (like Skype) often have a generic or unavailable caller ID and cannot receive incoming PSTN calls.
- **Permissive for Unknown Callers**: The technique allows calls from legitimate callers who are unknown to the recipient.

### Call Handling
- **Call Retrying and Voicemail Delivery**: If the call is not answered by a human, the system can be configured to retry the call later or deliver an audio message to the recipient's voicemail.

### Deployability Criteria
- **Minimal Infrastructure Changes**: The technique requires no or negligible changes to existing PSTN protocols, terminals, or infrastructure.
- **No Third-Party Involvement**: The method does not rely on third parties, thus avoiding potential mishandling of calls or privacy breaches.
- **Low Resource Requirement**: The technique is lightweight and does not demand significant resources (e.g., personnel, equipment, engineering, or funding) for initiation and deployment.
- **Low Maintenance**: The technique requires minimal administrative effort to maintain good working order.
- **Negligible Cost per Call**: The technique adds a negligible cost to each call, whether borne by the caller, recipient, third-party, or carriers. This cost can also be indirect, such as reduced efficiency or capacity.

### Robustness Criteria
- **Effective Against Dynamic Caller ID Spoofing**: The technique remains robust even when spammers use different caller IDs nondeterministically.
- **Effective Against Targeted Caller ID Spoofing**: The technique is resilient even when spammers spoof a specific caller ID known to be trusted by the recipient.
- **Effective Against Unavailable Caller ID**: The technique is effective even when spammers make the caller ID unavailable or send a faulty caller ID to cause errors.
- **Effective Against Multiple Identities**: The technique is robust even when spammers initiate calls from multiple sources, such as using multiple subscriber accounts or a telephone botnet, to distribute spam calls. This differs from caller ID spoofing, where the caller IDs are not necessarily spoofed but are initiated from different sources.
- **Effective Against Answering Machine Detection**: The technique is resilient even when spammers use Answering Machine Detection technology, which distinguishes human pick-ups from answering machines. With this feature, autodialers can avoid leaving messages on answering machines.
- **Effective Against Dynamic Audio Content**: The technique is robust even when spammers use autodialers capable of personalizing or altering audio messages for different recipients. This is a common feature in autodialers that can synthesize text to speech.

### Evaluation
- **Criteria Assessment**: Each technique is evaluated based on the criteria proposed in Section V. Table I visually summarizes this evaluation, indicating whether a technique satisfies the criteria (denoted as (cid:2)), may satisfy the criteria (denoted as (cid:3)(cid:4)), or does not satisfy the criteria (denoted as (cid:4)). "May satisfy the criteria" means the technique can meet the criteria depending on implementation or configuration, while some implementations may not fully satisfy them.
- **Subjectivity**: This analysis involves some subjectivity, and while others may disagree with the exact assessment, we believe the criteria outlined in Section V will guide future telephone spam defenses and provide a framework for evaluating these defenses.

### Combining Techniques
- **Phased Decisions**: This approach combines several techniques into a linear sequence of decision stages. If an earlier technique identifies a call as spam, subsequent stages may be unnecessary. This is suitable for techniques that use information obtained chronologically, such as first using Call Request Header Analysis followed by Voice Interactive Screening.
- **Weighted Scoring**: This method combines several techniques by running each individually and then combining their outputs to produce a final score using a weighted scoring method. The classification of whether a call is spam is based on this final score. Weighted Scoring is suitable for combining techniques that can be performed independently.

By combining these techniques, an improved anti-spam system can leverage the strengths of each method and mitigate their weaknesses.
