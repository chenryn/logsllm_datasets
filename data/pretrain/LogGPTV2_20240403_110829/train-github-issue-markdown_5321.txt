### Go Version
I am currently using Go version 1.5 release candidate 1 (go1.5rc1) and have also built from the source:
```
go version devel +6f0c7df Tue Aug 18 17:00:59 2015 +0000 linux/amd64
```

### Operating System and Processor Architecture
- **Operating System:** Linux 3.4
- **Processor Architecture:** amd64

### Steps Taken
I created a distribution of our library as a tarball, which includes the desired contents from `GOPATH/src` and `GOPATH/pkg`. Our distribution script implements the "mtime hack" discussed in the Go community. This involves packaging dummy source files that only contain the package declaration line and `.a` files with an mtime later than the corresponding source files.

### Expected Outcome
I expected to build an executable that imports the libraries in our distribution without any issues.

### Actual Outcome
When attempting to build the executable, the `go` tool complains about missing structs and functions in our dummy Go files. This issue is also referenced in [Go issue #2775](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/2775).

### Additional Attempt
I also tried to use the shared library feature introduced in Go 1.5 to distribute our library. However, this approach also appears to require the source code, which is not ideal for our distribution process.

If you have any further questions or need more details, please let me know.
