What version of Go are you using (go version)?  
I have tried go1.5rc1 and building from source:  
go version devel +6f0c7df Tue Aug 18 17:00:59 2015 +0000 linux/amd64
What operating system and processor architecture are you using?  
Linux 3.4, amd64
What did you do?  
Build a distribution of our library as a tarball of the desired contents of
GOPATH/src and GOPATH/pkg. Our distribution script implements the "mtime hack"
discussed here, packaging dummy source files that only contain the package
declaration line and .a files that have an mtime later than the corresponding
source files.
Then to test our distribution we try to build an executable that imports the
libraries in our distribution.
What did you expect to see?  
A built executable.
What did you see instead?  
The go tool complains about missing structs and funcs in our dummy go files.
This issue is also referenced in #2775
I also tried to use the shared library feature of go1.5 to distribute our
library, but that appears to also require the source code.
