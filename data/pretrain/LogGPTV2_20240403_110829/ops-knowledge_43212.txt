User: In the Enthought Traits/UI system, is there another way, other than being included in another Property's depends_on list, that a Property can become a dependency of another Property?
I have a HasTraits subclass, which has a property, chnl_h, which doesn't appear in any other Property's depends_on list, but is behaving as if it were a dependency of another Property. That is, it is recalculating its value, whenever one of its dependencies changes value, as opposed to only when its value is actually requested.
Thanks!

Assistant: I'm not sure this directly answers your question, but you may get what you're after by using the @cached_property decorator to reduce the number of time the property is computed.  I think there may be elements of "push" and "pull" style computations with properties.
