Zookeeper Questions:
Q1: As we can see with the ERROR that happened at 2015-07-29 19:53:03,501, this instance of
​
the unexpected exception on this line results in a goodbye message with an IP and port on the
next line from this thread. How many times does this type of 
ordered pair appear in the logs (not just this workflow instance)? (To count as an instance,
​ ​
the pair of  must share the same thread ID as each other and
the order must be an exception, followed by a goodbye message, however, they do not need to
appear on consecutive lines. Different pairs may be under different thread IDs)
Q2: Following the event that happened at 2015-07-30 17:49:05,932 (as listed below), an
​
exception occurs shortly after. What happens following the log message "Exception when
following the leader" for this execution sequence (i.e. workflow)? Describe the actions until the
process ends or another exception is encountered. (see user manual for information on
workflows)

Note: This can be very general / high level, and do not need to repeat same events (looking for
​
basic understanding) e.g. “Reading snapshot /var/lib/zookeeper/version-2/snapshot.100001546”
can be listed as “reading snapshot”
Q3: List the number of times the system attempts to open each channel starting at 2015-07-29
​
17:42:53,52 (for any execution sequences (i.e. workflow) at the indicated time or later with the
same thread ID)
e.g. Channel X: Y times, i.e. Channel W: Z times, etc
HDFS Questions:
Q4: How many unique types of execution sequences (i.e. workflow types) experience the
​
following exception: "received exception java.io.IOException: Could not read from stream"? (see
user manual for additional information on workflow types)
Q5: List the number of event sequences (i.e. workflows) that experience an error while trying to
​
delete a block (e.g., "Unexpected error trying to delete block") (see user manual for additional
information on workflows)
Q6: How many unique types of execution sequences (i.e. workflow types) contain messages
​
indicating successful verification for a block? (e.g. "Verification succeeded for blk_") (see user
manual for additional information on workflow types)
