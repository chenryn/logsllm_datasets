Abstract—In this work we present a systematic presentation
attack against ECG biometrics. We demonstrate the attack’s
effectiveness using the Nymi Band, a wrist band that uses elec-
trocardiography (ECG) as a biometric to authenticate the wearer.
We instantiate the attack using a hardware-based Arbitrary
Waveform Generator (AWG), an AWG software using a computer
sound card, and the playback of ECG signals encoded as .wav
ﬁles using an off-the-shelf audio player. In two sets of experiments
we collect data from a total of 41 participants using a variety of
ECG monitors, including a medical monitor, a smartphone-based
mobile monitor and the Nymi Band itself.
We use the ﬁrst dataset to understand the statistical differences in
biometric features that arise from using different measurement
devices and modes. Such differences are addressed through
the automated derivation of so-called mapping functions, whose
purpose is to transform ECG signals from any device in order to
resemble the morphology of the signals recorded with the Nymi
Band.
As part of our second dataset, we enroll users into the Nymi Band
and test whether data from any of our sources can be used for a
signal injection attack. Using data collected directly on the Nymi
Band we achieve a success rate of 81%. When only using data
gathered on other devices, this rate decreases to 43% when using
raw data, and 62% after applying the mapping function. While
we demonstrate the attack on the Nymi Band, we expect other
ECG-based authentication systems to most likely suffer from the
same, fundamental weaknesses.

INTRODUCTION
Passwords are the most prevalent mode of authentication
in many environments, including local workstations and on
the web. Despite their widespread use, they suffer from a
number of weaknesses [12], [13], [3]. Most notably, these
include users choosing weak passwords [15] and frequent
password-reuse [23]. Besides these weaknesses, the increasing
popularity of mobile and wearable devices gives rise to another
challenge: the lack of input devices to enter passwords (e.g.,
smart watches might only provide few buttons for user input).
Biometric recognition has become a popular approach to tackle

these limitations. Unlike passwords, which rely on the user
knowing something, biometrics make use of either distinctive
physiological properties or behavior. The former includes
ﬁngerprints, iris patterns and DNA, while keystroke dynamics,
touchscreen input, mouse movements and eye movements have
been proposed for the latter. Electrocardiography (ECG) records
the electrical activity of the heart over time. While ECG is
typically recorded in a hospital using 10 electrodes placed on
the patient’s skin, it can also be measured using two electrodes,
thus making it feasible to record with wearable devices. Due
to its distinctiveness and universality (every living human has
a heartbeat that can be measured), ECG as a biometric has
attracted considerable attention in recent years. Unlike most
behavioral biometric systems, which exist mostly as research
projects, ECG-based biometrics have resulted in a successful
commercial product, the Nymi Band1.
In this paper, we provide a systematic attack against ECG
biometrics and demonstrate its effectiveness by applying it to
the Nymi Band. To this end, we ﬁrst demonstrate our capability
of spooﬁng arbitrary ECG signals. To present the spoofed
signals we use three different devices, two Arbitrary Waveform
Generators (AWG), one software- and one hardware-based,
as well as the audio playback of ECG signals encoded as
.wav ﬁles using an off-the-shelf audio player. As such, the
technological barriers for the attacker are extremely low. We
collect ECG data from a total of 41 users and 5 devices. The
data shows that the morphology of the ECG signal depends
greatly on the device that was used. This difference constitutes
a major challenge, as a signal collected on one device can not
easily be used to carry out an attack on another. We tackle
this challenge by using the ﬁrst half of our dataset to devise
and train a so-called mapping function. The purpose of this
function is to transform an ECG signal collected on one device
such that its morphology matches that of another. The method
to generate these functions is general and can even be used for
other biometrics. After enrolling users in the Nymi Band we
use the mapping function to impersonate the user by presenting
the (transformed) ECG signals collected on different devices.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II
gives background information about ECG and ECG biometrics.

to spoof arbitrary ECGs. We outline our experimental design
and data collection in Section IV. In Section V we describe the

II. BACKGROUND
A. Electrocardiography
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a measurement of the
electrical activity of the heart. It is acquired through electrodes
placed on the patient’s skin, which are used to capture voltage
changes due to depolarization and repolarization of cardiac
cells, respectively provoking contraction and relaxation of the
cardiac muscle. The ECG is commonly used in clinical practice
for its crucial diagnostic capabilities [14]. In addition, the
present availability of low-cost ECG sensors has opened to
numerous applications in the area of wearable devices and
ﬁtness monitoring [18], leading to pervasive acquisition of
ECG data.
Figure 1 shows an example ECG for one cardiac cycle,
together with the duration and amplitude features typically
extracted for authentication purposes (detailed in Section II-B).
It comprises ﬁve main waves, P, Q, R, S and T, which map
to speciﬁc heart events: the P wave indicates activation of the
atria (the upper heart chambers); the QRS complex corresponds
to the activation of the ventricles (the lower chambers); and
the T wave indicates ventricular repolarization.
Most of ECG recording systems are based on the so-called
Einthoven’s lead system, where each lead records the difference
of potential between two electrodes. Einthoven’s leads consist
of:
Lead I:
Lead II:
Lead III:
VI = ΦLA − ΦRA VII = ΦLF − ΦRA VIII = ΦLF − ΦLA
is the voltage of lead i and Φj, with j ∈
where Vi
{LA, RA, LF}, is the potential at the left arm (LA), right
arm (RA) and left foot (LF ), respectively. In particular, the
standard 12-lead ECG used in clinical settings is an extension of
the Einthoven’s 3-lead system based on using seven additional
electrodes placed on the chest. Nevertheless, simpler 1-lead
ECG recording systems are increasingly being used in the
context of personal ECG monitoring and wearables.
B. ECG Biometrics
Driven by the distinctiveness and universality of ECG, the
body of work in this ﬁeld has been steadily growing over the
past few years. Recent surveys of systems based on ECG-based
biometrics can be found in [24], [8], [1]. The most striking
difference between approaches lies in the biometric features
used. The ﬁrst class of methods is based on time domain feature
extraction, and work by detecting the so-called ﬁducial points,
i.e., location, amplitude and width of the main ECG waves,
as shown in Figure 1. Some biometric systems also consider
the ST segment, that is, the length of the isoeletric segment
between the S and T waves, as well as the slope of waves. In
Figure 1, the wave slope is accounted for through the extraction
of left and right components of its width. In addition to the
above intra-beat morphological features, inter-beat features such
as Heart Rate Variability and beat patterns (represented by the
RR intervals) can well reﬂect the speciﬁc characteristics of the
subject.

domain features for ECG-based biometrics. Top: duration
features given by inter-peak distances. Right: amplitude features.
For each wave, we also consider its width at half amplitude
(grey solid lines). To account for asymmetric curves, the width
of each wave is split into left and right components (L and R
segments shown in P and T waves), i.e., before and after the
wave peak.
The second class of methods use frequency domain feature
extraction, meaning that features are obtained after converting
the ECG signal in the frequency domain. Examples include
application of wavelet decomposition and Fourier Transform.
In alternative to time and frequency domain methods, some
biometric systems employ statistical approaches for computing
the distance between enrolment ECG and recognition ECG
directly at the signal level, or analysis of the ECG’s trajectory
in the phase space.
Despite the numerous advantages of ECG-based biometrics,
they also suffer from some limitations, mostly addressed
through the use of multimodal biometrics. These are related
to the time-variant nature of the ECG, which is affected
by physical activity, emotional stress and minor random
disturbances like ectopic beats.
C. The Nymi Band
In this subsection we will outline the capabilities and system
design of the Nymi Band.
The Nymi Band (see Figure 2) is a wristband that in-
corporates an ECG sensor with two electrodes. The bottom
electrode constantly touches the user’s wrist while the band is
worn. In order to allow ECG measurements (most commonly
for enrollment and authentication) the user touches the top
electrode with the index ﬁnger of their other hand. As such,
the signal morphology can be expected to be similar to Lead
I of a medical ECG (which measures the potential difference
between the left and right arm). Besides the actual band, the
Nymi ecosystem consists of the Nymi Companion App (NCA)
and Nymi Enabled Applications (NEAs). The NCA is provided

pairing, the possession of the shared key (i.e., the presence of
the unlocked band) can then be conﬁrmed using a standard
challenge-response protocol.
There is one additional capability of NEAs that is relevant
to the remainder of the paper: The Nymi SDK grants NEAs
direct access to the band’s ECG sensor. Once the band and
an NEA are paired, the NEA can request the collection of an
arbitrary amount of raw ECG data. While this data collection
does not have to be explicitly approved by the user, the sensor
design requires the user to touch the top electrode with their
ﬁnger, thus making covert data collection virtually impossible.
It is noteworthy that this functionality has been removed from
the ofﬁcial SDK from version 2.0 onwards.
The Nymi Band’s threat model is described in the Nymi
Whitepaper. The band is designed as a three-factor authen-
tication system. In order to communicate with NEAs, an
attacker has to be in possession of the Nymi Band and the
NCA (typically the user’s phone) and be able to bypass the
biometric authentication. It is noteworthy that the latter, while
not explicitly stated in the Whitepaper, can also be achieved
by using the user’s backup password (e.g., through guessing
a weak password or social engineering). This is particularly
dangerous, as the presence of a second authentication factor
often leads to users choosing weaker passwords [26]. In terms
of bypassing ECG authentication (rather than using a password),
the Nymi Whitepaper claims that
”There is currently no known means of falsifying
an ECG waveform and presenting it to a biometric
recognition system.”
In the following sections we will investigate the validity of
this claim.
III. SPOOFING ECG SIGNALS
In this section, we show that fake ECG signals can be
injected into ECG enabled recognition systems. We start out
with the hypothesis that captured ECG measurements can be
reproduced at the biometric sensors without the benign user
having to be present.
A. Motivation
Like any other physiological trait, ECG signals can be
captured and (digitally) stored for an indeﬁnite amount of time
as the signals are relatively immutable. Biometric samples from
physiological traits do not lose validity and, if the ﬁdelity of
the stored signal is sufﬁciently high, it is possible to physically
reproduce the actual biometric signal at a later time. This
process does not require the individual from whom the biometric
measurements originate to be present.
In ECG recognition, biometric readings are usually acquired
with the help of an electrocardiograph, which works by
measuring the minute voltage differences of the human heart
over time. With today’s technologies in signal synthesis and
digital to analog conversion, artiﬁcially creating electrical
signals that exactly represent stored ECG signals is feasible.
While forging ECG signals is not a concern in the medical
domain, it is potentially problematic for ECG-based authentica-
tion systems. If a biometric system does not feature an agent or

as an app that runs on the user’s smartphone or tablet. The
NCA performs two main functions, enrollment and activation.
During enrollment, the Nymi Band is paired to an NCA.
The correct pairing is conﬁrmed by displaying a pattern on the
Nymi Band which the user has to verify against a pattern shown
by the NCA (similar to the numerical codes used in Bluetooth
device pairing). The Nymi Band and NCA then agree on a
shared key that binds the Nymi Band to this NCA. Following
pairing, the user is prompted to touch the band’s top electrode
with his index ﬁnger, after which their ECG is measured until
a speciﬁc amount of ECG data of sufﬁcient quality is captured.
The resulting biometric template is then encrypted and stored
by the NCA on the phone or tablet. Besides the shared secret,
no information is stored on the band at this time.
Activation is performed when the Nymi Band is taken off
and put back on again. Speciﬁcally, this event is detected by
the contact between two pins on the inside of the buckle being
interrupted (see Figure 2). As such, the Nymi Band does not
truly perform continuous authentication in the biometric sense,
but authenticates the user once and then detects a possible
change in user identity through the band being taken off. The
activation process is started by the user selecting the appropriate
action in the NCA, after which they can choose to perform ECG
authentication, or to use their backup password. If they choose
ECG, they are again prompted to touch the top electrode to
begin ECG measurement. Unlike enrollment, which runs until
a certain number of seconds of valid ECG data is collected,
activation runs until the NCA is sufﬁciently convinced of the
wearer’s identity. Once one or several heartbeats are observed
that match the owner’s template, the Nymi Band is put into
activated mode by the NCA. If no matching heartbeats are
observed after 60 seconds, the user is automatically rejected.
Once the Nymi Band is activated, it can be paired with
NEAs. Examples of NEAs include desktop computers (that
can then be unlocked without using a password), wearable
devices like smart watches and even more complex systems
like cars. At the time of writing, the Nymi Band is being
trialled for contactless payments. Initially, the band is paired
with the NEA through a process similar to regular Bluetooth
pairing. The Nymi Band displays a pattern using the ﬁve LEDs
(leading to only 32 possible combinations), which the user is
meant to conﬁrm before proceeding. The Nymi Band and the
NEA then use a Difﬁe-Hellman key exchange to negotiate

overseer — or other provisions against someone not using the
biometric sensors as intended — it is susceptible to so-called
presentation attacks. In a presentation attack the attacker tries
to spoof the biometric sensors with an artefact or contraption.
In case of ECG based recognition, the attacker would have
to fake the (time-dependent) voltage levels at the electrodes
interfacing the user with the help of an electrical device that
outputs an ECG signal.
In the remainder of this section, we show that it is indeed
possible to replay previously captured ECG signals. To that
end, we built three hardware contraptions of varying degrees of
sophistication that successfully create and inject ECG signals
into the sensing electrodes of a biometric system based on
ECG. We test our contraptions using the example of the
Nymi Band. In order to estimate difﬁculty and likelihood of
a presentation attack on ECG recognition, we additionally
evaluate our injection methods along the following non-
technical dimensions:
•
Cost: What is the overall cost for building the contrap-
tion and executing the injection? Although high cost
does not deter every attacker, it can discourage less
determined ones.
•
• Knowledge: Is expert knowledge required to build and
use the contraption or can it be put together following
simple instructions?
Size: Physical size is a very important factor. If the
contraption used for signal injection is sufﬁciently
small, an attacker can covertly spoof the biometric
sensors and might even circumvent a guarded biometric
system.
Signal quality: We quantize and compare the resulting
signal quality of each approach when applied to
injecting ECG signals into the Nymi Band. Obviously,
signal quality directly correlates with the probability of
success for a presentation attack. The conversion from
the (stored) biometric data to the physical biometric
signal should introduce as little noise as possible.
