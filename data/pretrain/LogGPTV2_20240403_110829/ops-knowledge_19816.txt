Question: "A penetration tester is tasked with evaluating the security of an organization's network. They are contemplating using an input capture technique that would be least likely to be detected by conventional security monitoring tools. Which of the following techniques should they avoid using if they want to remain undetected?"
 "A": "Credential API Hooking, as it may trigger alerts when API calls to SetWindowsHook, GetKeyState, and GetAsyncKeyState are monitored."
 "B": "GUI Input Capture, as it is usually transparent to the user and less likely to be noticed."
 "C": "Web Portal Capture, because it does not involve direct interaction with the system's API or processes."
 "D": "Keylogging, as it typically does not involve changes to system files or registry keys."
Answer: A
