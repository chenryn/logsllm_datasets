User: I am attempting to run a package after installing it, but am getting this error:
ImportError: /home/brownc/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/dawg.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: _ZTVNSt7__cxx1118basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEE
The dawg....gnu.so file is binary and so it doesn't give much information when opened in sublime.  I don't know enough about binary files in order to go in and remove the line or fix it.  Is there a simple fix for this that I am not aware of?
Assistant: I found the answer for my very specific case, for anyone that may run into this case as well:
I am using Anaconda (python 3 version) and installing the package with conda install -c package package worked instead of pip install package.
I hope this helps someone.
