Fig. 20. Consecutive attack interval
Figure 20 displays the CDF of the intervals between two
consecutive attacks. The ﬁgure shows that nearly 80% of the
consecutive attacks happened within 30 seconds. In practice,
this anticipated, and highlights the potential intelligence behind
those coordinated attacks: a longer interval would potentially
allow targets to deploy various defense mechanisms, and are
not likely to be logged in our dataset.
Figure 21 shows the attack magnitude of all consecutive
DDoS attacks. In this ﬁgure, the x-axis represents the 28
week timespan of our dataset, and the y-axis represents all
the targets attacked by these consecutive DDoS attacks. Each
dot represents a single DDoS attack. In this ﬁgure, the dots
displayed consecutively in a row indicate that
the attacks
were happened consecutively. Finally, the size of each marker
represents the attack magnitude of each DDoS attack and

Fig. 21. Consecutive attack magnitude
the different colors represent different families. We observe
that the attack magnitudes of different collaborating families
are relatively stable during the consecutive attacks, except for
Dirtjumper that has several attacks of a very large magnitude.
Summary. Intra- and inter-family collaborations could be due
to an underlying ecosystem, the evolution of a botnet family,
or the evolution of defense mechanisms, which all make
defending against them daunting tasks. Devising defenses that
employ this insight for attack attribution with an in-depth
understanding of the participating hosts in each family is
imperative.
VI. RELATED WORK
Research on prevention and mitigation of DDoS attacks
remains one of the hottest topics in the security community.
DDoS attacks have been intensively investigated and numerous
counter measures have been proposed to defend against them.
Huang et al. [16] addressed the issue of a lack of motivation for
organizations to adopt existing cooperative solutions to defeat
DDoS attacks by ﬁxing the incentive chain. As many DDoS
attacks are launched by botnets, another popular approach
to defend against attacks is to disrupt the C&C channel of
the botnet that launches the DDoS attack. However, most
current take-down methodologies are often ad-hoc and their
effectiveness are limited by the depth of knowledge about the
speciﬁc botnet family involved in the attack. A comprehensive
measurement and analysis of behaviors of different botnet
families are provided in [14]. To look closer to the botnet
take-down problem, Nadji et al. [17] proposed a take-down
analysis and recommendation system called rza, which not
only allows a postmortem analysis of past take-downs but also
provides recommendations for future take-down actions. As a
proactive solution to DDoS attacks, several ﬁltering schemes
[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], which must execute on IP routers,
have been proposed to prevent ﬂooding packets from reaching
target victims. Chen et al. [23] proposed a new defense system
that can detect DDoS attacks over multiple network domains.
Overlay-based protection systems such as Secure Overlay
Services [24] offer another attractive alternative, as it requires

no changes to existing network routing infrastructure and
minimal collaboration from ISPs. In their follow-up work [25]
Stavrou and Keromytis proposed a novel, multiple-path overlay
network that adopts a spread-spectrum-like communication
paradigm to address the limitations in existing overlay-based
approaches. Statistical approaches [26], [27], [28], [29] are
also applied to perform anomaly detection of DDoS attacks.
Work [26] identiﬁed DDoS attacks by computing entropy
and frequency-sorted distributions of selected packet attributes
of live trafﬁc. Lee et al. [29] proposed an efﬁcient method
for proactive detection of DDoS attacks using cluster anal-
ysis in which cubic clustering criterion (CCC) is used on
selected variables for clustering. Another research work [30]
advocated DDoS defense by offense. Authors designed and
implemented an application-level defense named Speak-Up,
in which victimized servers encourage all clients to automat-
ically send higher volumes of trafﬁc to attackers. Defense
mechanisms can be classiﬁed into two broad types depending
on their deployment location: either on the destination of
attacks (victim) or on the source of attacks. Historically, most
defense systems such as Cisco IDSM-2 [31] and Large-scale
Automated DDoS detection System [32] are deployed at the
destination since it suffers most of the impact. Mirkovic et
al. [33] proposed D-WARD, a DDoS defense system deployed
at source-end networks that autonomously detects and stops
attacks originating from these networks.
There have been several works on understanding unique
characteristic of DDoS attacks, such as their types, durations
and patterns. Wood and Stankovic extracted distinct features
of DDoS attacks that are unique to sensor networks [34], while
Geng et al. [35] focused on unique aspects of DDoS attacks
to ad hoc networks. Mirkovic et al. [36] and Specht and Lee
[37] proposed taxonomies of DDoS attacks and defenses. Work
[38] highlighted important features of each attack and defenses
and outlined pros and cons of the various defenses. In another
study, Peng et al. [39] presented a comprehensive survey of the
causes of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and the state-of-art
mechanisms for detecting and mitigating those attacks.
To understand the nature of DDoS attacks and develop
effective counter measures, measurement studies are conducted
on the DDoS data collected from network trafﬁc of real attacks.
Mao et al. [11] presented ﬁndings from a measurement study
of DDoS attacks relying on both direct measurements of ﬂow-
level information and more traditional indirect measurements
using backscatter analysis. Compared to their work, the data
source in our study is purely direct measurement of Internet
trafﬁc. Moore et al. [40] presented a backscatter analysis for
quantitatively estimating DoS attack activity on the Internet.
They applied their approach to a three-week long dataset to
study DoS attacks. Widespread DoS attacks were observed in
their study. Similar to our work, they discussed the attack
size, length and other characteristics followed by a victim
classiﬁcation including their geographical distribution. Their
study was performed in 2006. Several new trends in Internet
DDoS attacks are revealed in our work over their ﬁndings.
In a very recent work, Rossow [41] revisited other UDP-
based network protocols and identiﬁed protocols that are
susceptible to ampliﬁcation attacks. 14 protocols of various
services including network services such as Network Time
Protocol, Simple Network Management Protocol, legacy ser-
vices, p2p ﬁle sharing network and so on were shown to be
vulnerable and can be abused by distributed reﬂective denial-
of-service(DRDos) attacks.
Due to the growth of network address translation and
ﬁrewall techniques, much of the Internet was precluded from
the study by the traditional network measurement techniques.
Thus, work [12] proposed an opportunistic measurement ap-
proach that
leverages sources of spurious trafﬁcs such as
worms, DDoS backscatter, etc. to unveil unseen portions of
the Internet. The monitoring of packets destined for unused
Internet addresses, termed as ”background radiation,” proved
to be another useful technique to measure the Internet phe-
nomenon. In 2004, Pang et al. [9] conducted an initial study of
broad characteristics of Internet background radiation by mea-
suring trafﬁcs from four large unused subnets. Both ﬁltering
techniques and active transponders are used to perform passive
analysis and activity analysis of internet trafﬁc. In 2010, a more
recent study [10] revisited the same topic and characterized the
current state of background radiation speciﬁcally highlighting
those that exhibit signiﬁcant differences. Some new trends
are exposed including rapid growth outpacing the growth in
productive network trafﬁc, trends toward increasing SYN and
decreasing SYN-ACK trafﬁc, etc. In another research work,
Bailey et al. [13] designed and implemented the Internet
Motion Sensor (IMS), a globally scoped Internet monitoring
system to detect Internet threats, which includes a distributed
blackhole network with a lightweight responder and a novel
payload signature and caching mechanism. Another Internet
monitoring system, which primarily targets early detection of
worms, was presented in [42]. It used a non-threshold based
“trend detection” methodology to detect presence of worms by
using Kalman ﬁlter and worm propagation models.
Some other studies focus on trafﬁc characterization on IP
backbones in an attempt to build a general proﬁle in terms
of behaviors. Xu et al. [43] presented a general methodology
to build behavior proﬁles of Internet backbone trafﬁc in terms
of communication patterns of end-hosts and services. Their
work used data mining techniques to automatically discover
patterns from link-level trafﬁc data and provided plausible
interpretations of those patterns.
VII. CONCLUSION
DDoS attacks are frequently launched on the Internet.
While most of the existing studies have mainly focused on
designing various defense schemes,
the measurement and
analysis of large scale Internet DDoS attacks are not very
common, although understanding DDoS attacks patterns is the
key to defending against them. In this study, with the access to
a large scale dataset, we were able to collectively characterize
today’s Internet DDoS attacks from different perspectives. Our
in-depth investigation of these DDoS attacks reveals several
interesting ﬁndings about today’s botnet based DDoS attacks.
These results provide new insights for understanding and
defending against modern DDoS attacks at different levels
(e.g., organization and country). While this study focuses on
DDoS characterization, in the future, we plan to leverage these
ﬁndings to design more effective defense schemes.
