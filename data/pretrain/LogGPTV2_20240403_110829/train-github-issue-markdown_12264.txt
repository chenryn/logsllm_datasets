Still unsure if this problem is on numpy's side, but I tried downgrading to
1.14 (minimum numpy version for my dependencies) and verified it all works, no
errors.  
Given the recent changes on `random` I thought of bringing it up with you
guys, particularly @charris @mattip (from #14207 )
I am sorry I could not isolate a simple reproducible example yet, my setup is
inconveniently convoluted ATM.
I am using Ray to parallelize calls to the OpenAI Gym, this in turn implying a
numpy random state is pickled for storage on its Redis-based object store. The
un-pickling after Redis does not find the function `__randomstate_ctor()`.  
I tried adding it to the **init()** on the same fashion as (the suspiciously
similar) __RandomState_ctor(), but to no avail.
My hope is that someone with a better knowledge of this code will find
something useful in the error.
### Reproducing code example:
Sorry too complex yet, unable to isolate it.
