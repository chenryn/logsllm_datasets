ABSTRACT
Online retail, eCommerce, frequently falls victim to fraud conducted
by malicious customers (fraudsters) who obtain goods or services
through deception. Fraud coordinated by groups of professional
fraudsters that place several fraudulent orders to maximize their
gain is referred to as organized fraud. Existing approaches to fraud
detection typically analyze orders in isolation and they are not
effective at identifying groups of fraudulent orders linked to orga-
nized fraud. These also wrongly identify many legitimate orders as
fraud, which hinders their usage for automated fraud cancellation.
We introduce a novel solution to detect organized fraud by analyz-
ing orders in bulk. Our approach is based on clustering and aims
to group together fraudulent orders placed by the same group of
fraudsters. It selectively uses two existing techniques, agglomera-
tive clustering and sampling to recursively group orders into small
clusters in a reasonable amount of time. We assess our clustering
technique on real-world orders placed on the Zalando website, the
largest online apparel retailer in Europe1. Our clustering processes
100,000s of orders in a few hours and groups 35-45% of fraudulent
orders together. We propose a simple technique built on top of our
clustering that detects 26.2% of fraud while raising false alarms for
only 0.1% of legitimate orders.

1 INTRODUCTION
Online retail, also known as eCommerce, represents an important
share of the retail business. About 17.5% of all sales made in the
United States consists of eCommerce transactions, which accounts
for several trillions of dollars every year [39]. The expansion of
online retail is driven by its two main characteristics: 24/7 accessibil-
ity and scalability to a potentially unlimited number of customers.
However, these features also increase the exposure to frauds in
which malicious customers, fraudsters, obtain physical goods or
services through deception. It is estimated that 3 to 5% of online
orders constitute fraud, which accounts for over $50B in value every
year [41]. Fraud represents a direct monetary loss that can signifi-
cantly reduce the business valuation of online retailers [51] and it
must be mitigated.
Cancellation of fraudulent orders in a timely manner prevents
this monetary damage. To be effective, fraud cancellation requires
reliable means of detection. Cancelling legitimate orders decreases
customer loyalty, degrades brand image/reputation and causes a

shortfall in revenue estimated to over $100B every year [12]. Be-
cause of this reliability requirement, current approaches to can-
celing fraud rely on screening which is a manual process done by
human analysts [35]. Thus, screening is a costly process applied
to a limited number of orders and which can prevent only a lim-
ited amount of fraud. Screening can be facilitated using automated
analysis techniques that produce additional fraud indicators [31].
Nevertheless, these techniques are not accurate enough to provide
standalone and automated fraud cancellation [35].
The type of fraud that has been rising is organized fraud [27].
95 professional fraudsters performing organized fraud were ar-
rested in 2018 for committing fraud exceeding e8M in value [14].
In organized fraud, a small group of fraudsters coordinate fraud
campaigns against a chosen online retailer. Fraud campaigns span
a limited period of time during which several fraudulent orders
are placed for goods delivered in a limited geographical area. The
online retailer, Zalando, lost e18.5M to organized fraud in one
quarter of 2015 [51]. Since then, Zalando invested systematically
into their fraud detection systems, which reduced fraud to very
low numbers. Nevertheless, throughout the market, many current
automated techniques for fraud detection analyze orders in isola-
tion [8, 10, 17, 27, 43]. However, detecting organized fraud profits
from a global view of all orders placed in a given period of time.
Goal and contributions. We want to design a solution to detect
organized eCommerce fraud. We propose analyzing orders in bulk
rather than in isolation, to identify similarities among fraudulent
orders that belong to the same fraud campaign. Similar fraudulent
orders can be grouped together by applying clustering on relevant
attributes. Orders in the same fraud campaign have common charac-
teristics highlighted by identical categorical attributes, e.g., delivery
address, customer name, payment method, etc. Consequently, we
propose applying unsupervised categorical clustering on these at-
tributes to identify organized eCommerce fraud.
We introduce a novel approach for hierarchical categorical clus-
tering: recursive agglomerative clustering. This approach is specifi-
cally designed to group fraudulent orders placed on online retail
stores. It combines the benefits of (1) agglomerative clustering to
generate small clusters each potentially representing a fraud cam-
paign and (2) sampling to process a large number of orders in a
reasonable amount of time. Clusters obtained using our clustering
approach have two applications: A1 prioritizing orders that must be
analyzed through screening and A2 automatically canceling frauds
by deciding that all orders in a cluster are fraudulent if at least one
order in the cluster is fraudulent (e.g., older known fraud).
We assess the real-world effectiveness of our approach using
6M orders placed on the Zalando website [49], the largest online
apparel retailer in Europe. We claim the following contributions:
• a novel clustering technique for categorical data (Sect. 3.2).
It is a recursive clustering approach combining agglomera-
tive clustering and sampling to generate a large number of
clusters from medium-size datasets (100,000s of samples).
• two strategies for weighting categorical attributes (Sect. 4),
which facilitate the selection of optimal hyperparameters for
categorical clustering (Sect. 6.3).
• the evaluation of our clustering technique showing its effec-
tiveness at grouping fraudulent orders (Sect. 7). It generates
clusters mixing a small number of fraudulent and legitimate
orders (0.8%) while grouping a large portion of fraudulent
orders (42.1%) together. Its computation time is much lower
than existing clustering techniques and is able to process,
e.g., 15,000 orders in 3 minutes.
• the demonstration that generated clusters can be used to
automatically detect 26.2% of real-world fraud perpetrated
against Zalando, while causing only 0.1% false alarms for
legitimate orders incorrectly identified as fraud (Sect. 8).
2 DETECTING ECOMMERCE FRAUD
We focus on the detection of fraudulent orders committed against
online retailers, which we simply name frauds from now on. In
this paper, we tackle the specific use case of detecting fraud perpe-
trated against Zalando [49]. Zalando is an online apparel retailer
operating in 17 markets, having 28 million active customers and
generating over e5B in revenue yearly [52]. We believe this use
case is representative of many large online retailers. We focus on
detecting fraud where fraudsters obtain physical goods through de-
livery with no intent of paying for them. The order can either be in
payment default or paid with illegally acquired means of payment.
In both cases, the retailer suffers monetary losses.
2.1 Fraud detection and cancellation
A typical2 fraud detection pipeline [11, 13, 35] is depicted in Fig. 1.
An order is represented by a set of numerical features and cate-
gorical attributes. This information is automatically validated to
confirm the order which serves as a preliminary step for the fraud
detection process. Features and attributes representing an order are
fed to several scoring functions that automatically produce fraud
indicators. These functions can use additional background infor-
mation (e.g., from customer history) and they typically rely on
human defined heuristics and supervised machine learning (ML)
models [8, 37, 43]. Fraud indicators and raw order information are
provided to a screening process that decides if the order is legiti-
mate and should proceed or if it is a fraud and it should be canceled.
Cancellations are usually performed based on a combination of
machine learning systems and human expert knowledge.
Fraud detection is a time constrained process that must happen
after an order is placed and before it is processed for shipping.
This typically gives only a few hours to detect fraud and only a
small fraction of orders can be inspected by human experts. On the
other hand, many automated scores are computed on each order
2This pipeline is chosen for the sake of generalizability. The particular fraud detection
setup at Zalando is not taken into account in this paper and it does not perfectly match
this typical pipeline.

independently, which can decrease their efficiency at detecting
organized fraud.
2.2 Preventing organized fraud
Fraud can be either isolated events occasionally performed by in-
dividuals or organized by criminal groups of professional fraud-
sters [27]. Organized fraud relies on coordinated events, fraud cam-
paigns, that target a specific online retailer. During a fraud cam-
paign, several orders are placed over a limited period of time (e.g.,
one month), by a small group of fraudsters having several electronic
identities each. Most orders are fraudulent and all orders are deliv-
ered in a restricted geographical area (e.g., the same city) where
the criminal group operates. Also, fraud campaign typically uses
payment methods that are known to be vulnerable to fraud [51]. We
propose to prevent organized fraud by identifying fraud campaigns.
Following that fraud belonging to a same campaign has similar
characteristics, we propose to group similar orders together in order
to identify fraud campaigns. In this study, we restrict ourselves to
certain categorical attributes, i.e., delivery address, customer name,
payment method, etc. Numerical features have already been exten-
sively used for fraud detection [9, 10, 48] and we want to investigate
the capabilities of categorical attributes in their own right. Since we
do not have a priori knowledge about orders that belong to a fraud
campaign, we propose to take an unsupervised clustering approach
to group similar orders and apply it to categorical attributes of
orders. Ideally it would generate one cluster per fraud campaign,
containing all frauds of this campaign but no legitimate order. Also,
most legitimate orders should have low similarity between each
other and thus, be less likely to be grouped into clusters.
Figure 1 depicts the deployment of our clustering approach in
the fraud detection pipeline. It has two applications.
A1 Prioritizing screening. Clustered orders can be screened
with high priority to detect a large number of frauds with
a minimal effort. We expect frauds to be clustered at a sig-
nificantly higher rate than legitimate orders. Comparing
orders in the same cluster provides human analysts with
new information that may facilitate the cancellation.

applied to clusters of orders rather than to individual or-
ders. Several orders provide aggregated information that
may depict fraudulent behavior more reliably than isolated
orders. An automated process can decide if the whole cluster
is fraudulent and cancel the orders.
While a significant share of frauds is organized and may be as-
sociated with a fraud campaign, frauds can also be isolated events.
We focus on detecting organized fraud only and our approach is
not designed to detect isolated fraud cases. Our approach is com-
plementary to the extensive prior work addressing the detection of
fraud in isolation [2, 9, 17, 29].
2.3 Attributes representing orders
In the following, we represent each order by 37 categorical at-
tributes, which have discrete values with no intrinsic ordering.
These attributes were selected for the sake of generalizability. They
belong to 5 categories of information that is generally provided by
a customer placing an order on any online retailer.
• Customer Acust (9 attributes): related to the electronic iden-
tity of the customer, e.g., email address, IP address, etc.
• Delivery Adel (3 attributes): related to the means used for
order delivery, e.g, pickup point, delivery type, etc.
• Shipping Aship (7 attributes): related to identity and location
(address) of the person receiving the order.
• Payment Apay (11 attributes): related to payment method,
e.g., bank transfer, credit card suffix, etc.
• Billing Abill (7 attributes): related to identity and location
(address) of the person paying the order.
Many of our attributes contain Personally Identifiable Informa-
tion (PII) which were anonymized prior to perform any data anal-
ysis. The clustering approach we introduce and the experimental
results we obtain use these anonymized attribute values.
2.4 Challenges in clustering fraud campaigns
Clustering orders that belong to fraud campaigns requires to address
several challenges related to (a) categorical clustering, (b) fraud
detection and (c) the application domain of online retail.
C1 Imbalanced attribute cardinality. Categorical attributes
representing orders take a different number of values (car-
dinality), from two values to millions. High cardinality pre-
vents the numerical encoding of attributes. Imbalance makes
it difficult to quantify the similarity between two orders.
C2 Imbalanced classes. The ratio of fraudulent to legitimate
orders is highly imbalanced, typically around 1/50 [41]. Prob-
ability of clustering legitimate orders is much higher than
that of clustering frauds, which is undesirable.
C3 No ground truth for fraud campaign. There is no infor-
mation which fraud corresponds to which fraud campaign.
Only ground truth for individual orders is available.
C4 Scale of the data. Large online retailers receive 100,000s
of orders per day. Zalando receives 300,000 orders on av-
erage every day [52]. Most existing categorical clustering
methods [15, 20, 50] have a high complexity and they cannot
process data of such a scale in a reasonable amount of time.
2.5 Requirements
We define the following requirements for a clustering approach to
detect fraud campaigns:
R1 Generate small clusters. There are many more legitimate
orders than frauds (C2). Also, a fraud campaign typically
contains a low number (e.g., 10s-100s) of orders. In order
to group frauds, clustering must generate a large number
of small clusters, each potentially corresponding to a single
fraud campaign.
R2 Minimize cluster impurity. The cluster impurity must be
low. Generated clusters must be composed either only of
legitimate orders or only of frauds.
R3 Maximize clustered fraud. Frauds isolated in singletons
(clusters with one component) are not linked to any fraud
campaign and they cannot be detected by our method. We
must maximize the rate of detected fraud.
R4 Minimize execution time. Online retailers receive 100,000s
of orders per day. Our approach must be able to process such
amount of data (C4) in a reasonable amount of time allowing
for cancellation (e.g., a few hours).
Regarding R1, we do not have ground truth for fraud campaigns
(C3) and we cannot evaluate the “goodness” of our clusters with
respect to grouping frauds from the same campaign. We ensure
