Hi,
I just tried the latest beta. It is confusing to me and others I've spoken
with why template variable binding to ngControl would - as visually written in
the template - be binding to ngForm instead? (The current beta is requiring
this according to documentation.) I believe one of the design goals of Angular
was to make it clear in the template what is happening. Currently, this is not
clear. The required template syntax for control binding within a form does not
match what is actually occurring according to the documentation.
If one wants to refer to an ngControl on the form using a template local
variable, why should the binding look like the following confusing syntax
where the #name template variable is tied to an ngForm directive instead as
shown on your documentation page
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/forms.html?
CONFUSING in the current beta:  
ngControl="name" #name="ngForm"
BETTER:  
ngControl="name" #name="ngControl"
Wouldn't a better syntax be to bind the template variable for the control to
the ngControl which is actually then intent and effect of this syntax even as
your documentation describes?
It would be even better if ngControl="name" would auto-create the #name
template variable so only one attribute rather than 2 would be required but
perhaps there is an interest in being highly explicit so possibly having both
could make sense for the purpose of explicitness and perhaps tool binding (but
it would be very nice to just be able to indicate ngControl='name' and be
done.)
Even so, if the #name should be tied to an ngControl, shouldn't the template
reflect what is being done for clarity by using #name=ngControl rather than
#name=ngForm?
If we have one form on the page and 3 controls inside it, shouldn't the form
itself have the template variable set to 'ngForm' (#heroForm="ngForm") while
the 3 controls should be set as shown on the template to 'ngControl'
(ngControl="name" #name="ngControl" --- ngControl="addressLine1"
#addressLine1="ngControl" --- ngControl="city" #city="ngControl")?
#### as shown in documentation...

I'm asking in this issue why when the documentation says that the syntax sets
the instance to the ngControl directive, the syntax as written is actually
showing #name="ngForm" which intuits that Angular2 is setting the template
instance variable to the ngForm? To be consistent with what is actually
happening, wouldn't the clearer syntax for an ngControl be #name="ngControl" ?
Here is the form syntax that the paragraph from the documentation is
explaining when it says #name='ngForm' actually makes name point to the
ngControl directive:
      Name is required
      Address first line is required
      City is required
