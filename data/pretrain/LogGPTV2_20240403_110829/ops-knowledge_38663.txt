User: 你作为资深数据库管理员，帮助解答一些数据库故障诊断问题。请描述 complex_execution_plan 如何作为数据库性能问题的根因排查
Assistant: This is a function that checks for complex execution plans in SQL statements. The function identifies two cases that may cause complex execution plans: (1) a large number of join or group operations, and (2) a very complex execution plan based on its height. If the function identifies either of these cases, it sets the corresponding details and suggestions for the user. If the number of join operators exceeds the "complex_operator_threshold" or the plan height exceeds the "plan_height_threshold", the function considers it a root cause of the problem. Otherwise, it is not a root cause.

辅助排查的数据来自以下prometheus性能监控指标：- complex_boolean_expression
- plan_parse_info
- plan_parse_info.height
- join_operator
- len(join_operator)
