- You can also use the **Auto-forwarded messages** report in the Exchange admin center (EAC). For instructions, see [Auto forwarded messages report in Exchange Online](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-auto-forwarded-messages-report).
  **Notes**:
  - Look for unusual target locations, or any kind of external addressing.
  - Look for forwarding rules with unusual key words in the criteria such as *all mail with the word invoice in the subject*. Contact the mailbox owner to check whether it is legitimate.
### Review Inbox rules
Check for the removal of Inbox rules, considering the timestamps in proximity to your investigation. As an example, use the following command in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell):
```powershell
Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate 12/16/2021 -EndDate 03/16/2022 -Operations Remove-InboxRule | Export-CSV NoTypeInformation -Path c:\temp\removedInboxRules.csv
```
### Review Exchange mail flow rules (transport rules)
There are two ways to get the list of Exchange mail flow rules (also known as transport rules) in your organization:
1. In the Exchange admin center or Exchange Online PowerShell. For instructions, see [View or modify a mail flow rule](/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/manage-mail-flow-rules).
2. The **Exchange transport rule** report in the Exchange admin center. For instructions, see [Exchange transport rule report in Exchange Online](/exchange/monitoring/mail-flow-reports/mfr-exchange-transport-rule-report).
Look for new rules, or rules that have been modified to redirect the mail to external domains. The number of rules should be known and relatively small. You can do an audit log search to determine who created the rule and from where they created it. If you see something unusual, contact the creator to determine if it is legitimate.
### Get the latest dates when the user had access to the mailbox
In the Microsoft 365 security & compliance center, navigate to [unified audit log](https://protection.office.com/#/unifiedauditlog). Under **Activities** in the drop-down list, you can filter by **Exchange Mailbox Activities**.
The capability to list compromised users is available in the [Microsoft 365 security & compliance center](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports#compromised-users-report-new).
This report shows activities that could indicate a mailbox is being accessed illicitly. It includes created or received messages, moved or deleted messages, copied or purged messages, sent messages using send on behalf or send as, and all mailbox sign ins. The data includes date, IP address, user, activity performed, the item affected, and any extended details.
> [!NOTE]
> For this data to be recorded, you must enable the **mailbox auditing** option.
The volume of data included here could be very substantial, so focus your search on users that would have high-impact if breached. Look for unusual patterns such as odd times of the day, or unusual IP addresses, and look for patterns such as high volumes of moves, purges, or deletes.
### Did the user read / open the email?
There are two main cases here:
- The mailbox is in Exchange Online.
- The mailbox is in on-premises Exchange (Exchange hybrid).
#### Did the Exchange Online user open the email
Use the **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet in [Exchange Online PowerShell](/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell) to do a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.
The following example query searches Janes Smith's mailbox for an email that contains the phrase *Invoice* in the subject and copies the results to *IRMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation.*
```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith" -SearchQuery "Subject:Invoice" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" LogLevel Full
```
The following sample query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the phrase *InvoiceUrgent* in the subject and copies the results to *IRMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation*.
```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery 'InvoiceUrgent vote' -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```
#### Did the user open the email in Exchange hybrid
Use the **Get-MessageTrackingLog** cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:
```powershell
Get-MessageTrackingLog -Server Mailbox01 -Start "03/13/2022 09:00:00" -End "03/15/2022 17:00:00" -Sender "PI:EMAIL"
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MessageTrackingLog](/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrackinglog).
### Who else got the same email?
There are two main cases here:
- The mailbox is in Exchange Online.
- The mailbox is in on-premises Exchange (Exchange hybrid).
The workflow is essentially the same as explained in the [Get the list of users / identities who got the email](#get-the-list-of-users--identities-who-got-the-email) section earlier in this article.
#### Find the email in Exchange Online
Use the **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox.
This sample query searches all tenant mailboxes for an email that contains the subject *InvoiceUrgent* in the subject and copies the results to *IRMailbox* in a folder named *Investigation*.
```powershell
Get-Mailbox | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery "Subject:InvoiceUrgent" -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```
#### Find the email in on-premises Exchange
Use the **Get-MessageTrackingLog** cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:
```powershell
Get-MessageTrackingLog -Server Mailbox01 -Start "03/13/2018 09:00:00" -End "03/15/2018 17:00:00" -MessageSubject "InvoiceUrgent"
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MessageTrackingLog](/powershell/module/exchange/get-messagetrackinglog).
### Did the email contain an attachment?
There are two main cases here:
- The mailbox is in Exchange Online.
- The mailbox is in on-premises Exchange (Exchange hybrid).
#### Find out if the message contained an attachment in Exchange Online
If the mailbox is in Exchange Online, you have two options:
- Use the classic **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet
- Use the **New-ComplianceSearch** cmdlet
Use the **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet to perform a specific search query against a target mailbox of interest and copy the results to an unrelated destination mailbox. Here's an example:
```powershell
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Search-Mailbox -SearchQuery attachment:trojan* -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Search-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailbox).
The other option is to use the **New-ComplianceSearch** cmdlet. Here's an example:
```powershell
New-ComplianceSearch -Name "Investigation" -ExchangeLocation "Research Department" -ContentMatchQuery "from:PI:EMAIL AND hasattachment:true"
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-ComplianceSearch](/powershell/module/exchange/new-compliancesearch).
#### Find out if the message contained an attachment in in on-premises Exchange
> [!NOTE]
> In Exchange Server 2013, this procedure requires Cumulative Update 12 (CU12) or later. For more information, see [this article](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/search-mailbox-cmdlet-with-attachment-keyword-lists-all-items-that-contain-the-query-string-of-attachment-b0422602-9f14-e85a-434f-81a14549574d).
Use the **Search-Mailbox** cmdlet to search for message delivery information stored in the message tracking log. Here's an example:
```powershell
Search-Mailbox -Identity "Jane Smith"-SearchQuery AttachmentNames:attachment_name -TargetMailbox "IRMailbox" -TargetFolder "Investigation" -LogLevel Full
```
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Search-Mailbox](/powershell/module/exchange/search-mailbox).
### Was there a payload in the attachment?
Look for potential malicious content in the attachment. For example, PDF files, obfuscated PowerShell, or other script codes.
The **View data by Email \> Malware** view in the **Threat protection status** report shows the number of incoming and outgoing messages that were detected as containing malware for your organization. For more information, see [Threat protection status report: View data by Email \> Malware](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/view-email-security-reports#view-data-by-email--malware-and-chart-breakdown-by-detection-technology).
### Check email header for true source of the sender
Many of the components of the message trace functionality are self-explanatory but you need to thoroughly understand about *Message-ID*. The *Message-ID* is a unique identifier for an email message.
To obtain the *Message-ID* for an email of interest, you need to examine the raw email headers. For instructions on how to do this in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook on the Web (formerly known as Outlook Web App or OWA) see [View internet message headers in Outlook](https://support.microsoft.com/office/view-internet-message-headers-in-outlook-cd039382-dc6e-4264-ac74-c048563d212c)
When viewing an email header, it is recommended to copy and paste the header information into an email header analyzer provided by [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx) or [Azure](https://mha.azurewebsites.net/) for readability.
- **Headers Routing Information:** The routing information provides the route of an email as its being transferred between computers.
- **Sender Policy Framework (SPF):** An email validation to help prevent/detect spoofing. In the SPF record, you can determine which IP addresses and domains can send email on behalf of the domain.
- **SPF = Pass:** The SPF TXT record determined the sender is permitted to send on behalf of a domain.
  - SPF = Neutral
  - SPF = Fail: The policy configuration determines the outcome of the message
    Sender IP
  - SMTP Mail: Validate if this is a legitimate domain
  For more information about SPF, see [How Microsoft 365 uses SPF to prevent spoofing](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/how-office-365-uses-spf-to-prevent-spoofing)
- **Common Values:** Here is a breakdown of the most commonly used and viewed headers, and their values. This is valuable information and you can use them in the **Search** fields in Threat Explorer.
  - From address
  - Subject
  - Message ID
  - To address
  - Return-path address
- **Authentication-Results:** You can find what your email client authenticated when the email was sent. It will provide you with SPF and DKIM authentication.
- **Originating IP:** The original IP can be used to determine if the IP is blocklisted and to obtain the geo location.
- **Spam Confidence Level (SCL):** This determines the probability of an incoming email is spam.
  - \-1: Bypass most spam filtering from a safe sender, safe recipient, or safe listed IP address (trusted partner)
  - 0, 1: Non-spam because the message was scanned and determined to be clean
  - 5, 6: Spam
  - 7, 8, 9: High confidence spam
The SPF record is stored within a DNS database and is bundled with the DNS lookup information. You can manually check the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record for a domain by using the *nslookup* command:
1. Open the command prompt (**Start \> Run \> cmd**).
2. Type the command as: `nslookup -type=txt"` a space, and then the domain/host name. For example:
    ```DOS
     nslookup -type=txt domainname.com
    ```
> [!NOTE]
> *-all* (reject or fail them - don't deliver the email if anything does not match), this is recommended.
### Check if DKIM is enabled on your custom domains in Microsoft 365
You need to publish two CNAME records for every domain they want to add the domain keys identified mail (DKIM). See how to [use DKIM to validate outbound email sent from your custom domain](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dkim-to-validate-outbound-email).
### Check for domain-based message authentication, reporting, and conformance (DMARC)
You can use this feature to [validate outbound email in Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/use-dmarc-to-validate-email#CreateDMARCRecord).
### Verify IP addresses to attackers/campaigns
To verify or investigate IP addresses that have been identified from the previous investigation steps, you can use any of these options:
- VirusTotal
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Public Sources:
  - [Ipinfo.io](http://ipinfo.io/) - Has a free option to obtain geo-location
  - [Censys.io](http://censys.io/) - Has a free option to obtain information about what their passive scans of the internet know
  - [AbuseIPDB.com](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) - Has a free option that provides some geolocation
  - Ask Bing and Google - Search on the IP address
### URL reputation
You can use any Windows 10 device and Microsoft Edge browser which leverages the [SmartScreen](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview) technology.
Here are a few third-party URL reputation examples
- [Trend Micro Site Safety Check](https://global.sitesafety.trendmicro.com/)
- [Google Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?hl=en)
- [Talos Intelligency](https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/)
As you investigate the IP addresses and URLs, look for and correlate IP addresses to indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other indicators, depending on the output or results and add them to a list of sources from the adversary.
### Did the user click links in the email?
