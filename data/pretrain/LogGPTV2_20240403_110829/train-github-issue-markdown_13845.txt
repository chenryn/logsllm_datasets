### Feature Request: Enhanced Scrollbar for Visual Studio Code

I would like to request the addition of the Enhanced Scrollbar feature, which was available in Visual Studio 2013 and 2015, to Visual Studio Code. This feature significantly improves navigation within a file by providing a more detailed and interactive scrollbar, making it easier to move around and locate specific sections of code.

If this feature is already available as an extension or through a configuration option, I have been unable to find it. Adding this functionality to VS Code would greatly enhance the user experience and productivity.

Thank you for considering this request.
