User: How to set SSH key to log in to remote server without password
Assistant: You can follow the steps below to set up an SSH key to log in to a remote server without a password: 1. Generate a key pair. Open a terminal on your local computer and enter the following command: ``` ssh-keygen ``` Follow the prompts to enter the file name and password. Entering no passphrase will omit this, but it is recommended to enter a strong passphrase to protect your private key. 2. Add the public key to the authorization file on the remote server. Use the following command to add the public key to the authorization file of the remote server: ``` ssh-copy-id username@remote_host ``` Just enter the password of the remote server. If you are using a non-standard port number, add the `-p` option to specify the port number, for example: ``` ssh-copy-id -p 2222 username@remote_host ``` 3. Test the SSH connection. Use the following command to test the SSH connection: ``` ssh username@remote_host ``` If you connect successfully without entering a password, it means that you have successfully set the SSH key to log in to the remote server without a password. Note: The above commands are for Linux system and macOS system. If you are using a Windows system, use PuTTY to set up SSH keys.
