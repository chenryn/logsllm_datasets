### ATT&CK ID: T1645
### ATT&CK Technique Name: Compromise Client Software Binary

Adversaries may compromise client software binaries to establish persistent access to a target device. These system software binaries are integral components used by the underlying operating system and can be accessed by users through tools such as `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) or terminal emulators. By modifying these binaries, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed whenever the compromised binary is run, thereby maintaining long-term access to the device.
