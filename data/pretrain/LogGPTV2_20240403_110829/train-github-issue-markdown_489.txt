    What does 'go version' print?
    go version go1.3 linux/amd64
    go version devel +f7e7857afd88 Fri Aug 01 16:45:33 2014 -0700 linux/amd64
    What steps reproduce the problem?
    If possible, include a link to a program on play.golang.org.
    1. Run code at http://play.golang.org/p/41yjG2bL40
    What happened?
    Displays errors "json: cannot unmarshal number 1e2 into Go value of type
    *int*" for all int types.
    What should have happened instead?
    No errors should be reported (and correct number should be unmarshaled).
    The behaviour clearly is inline with strconv.{ParseInt,ParseUint}, but that does
    arguably not agree with the JSON specification - unless int types are determined to not
    be numbers.
