However, in two cases the students were not able to social
engineer the custodian directly and were forced to look for
alternative approaches. For example, in one of the cases
the students entered the building before working hours. At
this time the cleaning lady cleans the oﬃces, and under the
assumption it is their oﬃce let the students inside. After
entering the oﬃce, the students cut the Kensington lock and
left the building before the custodian arrived.
We debriefed only the custodians through a group pre-
sentation, where we explained the penetration test and its
goal.
5.6 Lessons learned from the validation
It should be speciﬁed in advance which information the
penetration tester is allowed to use. For example, the pen-
etration tester should not use knowledge about the cover
story used by the contact person. During the validation,
six penetration testers used knowledge of the cover story to
convince the custodian to hand in the laptop. Thus, these
tests were less realistic.
Panic situations need to be taken into consideration in the
termination conditions. Several times the custodian or an
employee got suspicious and raised an alarm. Since only the
security oﬃcer knew about the experiment, and the other se-
curity personnel was excluded, news of people stealing lap-
tops spread in a matter of hours.
In these situations the
coordinator should react quickly and explain to the employ-
ees that the suspicious activity is a test.
The penetration test cannot be repeated many times.
If
a custodian participated in the penetration test once, she
knows what will happen. The same holds for the employees
she told about the experiments and the employees that were
socially engineered.
6. EVALUATION
In this section we compare both methodologies against the
R* requirements. The satisfaction of the requirements is de-
ﬁned by the rules of engagement, which attack scenarios are
approved for execution, and the structure of the method-
ologies. Less restrictive rules of engagement and approving
more invasive attack scenarios make the penetration test
more realistic, but make the test less reliable and respectful
to the employees. The evaluation below assumes these two
elements are tuned to the risk appetite of the organization
and focuses only on the structure of the methodologies.
Reliable: In the EF methodology, the penetration tester
gains possession of a non-critical asset which the custodian
is prepared to lose. Thus, the result of the penetration test
will not aﬀect the productivity of the custodian.
In the
CF methodology, the productivity of the custodian may be
aﬀected, since the custodian does not know the asset will
be stolen. The informed consent is a mechanism to avoid
productivity loss, since it explicitly states not to use the
marked asset for daily tasks nor store sensitive information
on the asset.
In both methodologies, the productivity of
other employees is not aﬀected, since the penetration tester
does not gain possession of any of their belongings without
their approval.
Repeatable: The repeatability of any penetration test us-
ing social engineering is questionable, since human behavior
is unpredictable. Checking if a penetration test is repeatable
would require a larger set of tests on a single participant, and
a larger number of participants in the test.
Reportable: The approach used in reporting the results
of the penetration test completely covers all information
needed to perform the attack in a real-life situation and
provides an overview of what should be improved to thwart
such attempts. The logs from the tester and the monitoring
equipment installed by the custodians provide detailed infor-
mation on all actions taken by the penetration tester, giving
a clear overview of how the mechanisms are circumvented.

Respectful: Both methodologies should respect all the em-
ployees and the trust relationships between them.
In physical penetration testing, the social engineering el-
ement is more intense than in digital penetration testing
because the interaction between the penetration tester and
the employee is direct, without using any digital medium.
Baumrind [15] considers deception of subjects in testing as
unethical. The National Commission for the Protection of
Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research,
also clearly states this in their ﬁrst rule of ethical princi-
ples: ”Respect for persons” [9].
However, some tests cannot be executed without decep-
tion. Finn [10] deﬁnes four justiﬁcations that need to be met
do make deception acceptable: (1) The assessment cannot
be performed without the use of deception. (2) The knowl-
edge obtained from the assessment has important value. (3)
The test involves no more than minimal risk and does not
violate the rights and the welfare of the individual. Min-
imal risk is deﬁned as: ”the probability and magnitude of
physical or psychological harm that is normally encountered
in the daily lives” [16]. (4) Where appropriate, the subjects
are provided with relevant information about the assessment
after participating in the test. Physical penetration testing
using social engineering can never be completely respectful
because it is based on deception. However, the deception in
both methodologies presented in this paper is justiﬁable.
The ﬁrst two justiﬁcations are general for penetration test-
ing and its beneﬁts, and have been discussed earlier in the
literature (for example, Barrett [6]). The third justiﬁcation
states that the risk induced by the test should be no greater
than the risks we face in daily lives. In the EF methodology,
the only actor at risk is the employee. The penetration tester
cannot physically harm the employee because of the rules of
engagement, thus only psychological harm is possible. If the
employees help the penetration tester voluntarily, the risk
of psychological harm is minimal. The logging equipment
assures the interaction can be audited in a case of dispute.
In the CF methodology, an additional actor at risk is the
custodian. The only case when the risk is above minimal
for the custodian is if the tester gains possession of the asset
without custodian’s knowledge. When the custodian ﬁnds
the asset missing, her stress level might increase. Therefore
it is crucial for the contact person to reach the custodian
before custodian learns about the theft.
The fourth justiﬁcation states that all actors should be de-
briefed after the exercise. In both methodologies, all actors
except the employees are either fully aware of the exercise, or
have signed an informed consent and are debriefed after the
exercise. Similarly to Finn and Jakobsson [1], we argue that
there should be selective debrieﬁng of the employees. De-
brieﬁng can make the employee upset and disgruntled and is
the only event where the risk is higher then minimal. Thus,
an employee should be debriefed only if the security oﬃcer
constitutes the tester did more than minimal harm.
Besides being respectful toward all the participants, the
methodology needs to maintain the trust relations between
the employees. The EF methodology aﬀects the trust be-
tween the custodian and the employees and the employees
and the organization. This is a consequence of the decision
to fully debrief all participants in the test. The CF method-
ology looks at reducing these impacts. First, the custodians
are not told who contributed to the attack. Only the coordi-
nator and the security oﬃcer have this information, and they
are not related to the custodian. Second, the employees are
not informed about the penetration test unless it deemed
necessary. However, the trust between the custodian and
the contact person is shaken. Therefore, the contact person
and the custodian should not know each other prior to the
test.
In conclusion, the CF methodology is less respectful to
the custodian than the EF methodology, because the custo-
dian is deceived and might get stressed when she ﬁnds out
the asset is gone. The EF methodology does not preserve
any trust between the employees, the organization and the
custodian. The CF methodology preserves the trust bond
between the custodian and the employees and between the
employees and the organization. However, the trust bond
between the custodian and the contact person may be af-
fected.
Realistic: The EF methodology allows testing the resilience
to social engineering of employees in the organization. Since
the custodian knows about the penetration test, she is not
directly involved during the execution of the test, making
this methodology implementable in limited number of situ-
ations. In the CF methodology, neither the custodian nor
any of the other employees know about the penetration test,
making the test realistic.
One might argue that if the asset is not critical for the em-
ployee, the tests are not realistic. On the other hand, taking
away ”real” assets in the penetration tests will clearly cause
loss of production. In the EF methodology, this issue does
not exist, as the employees who may be social-engineered
are not aware of the importance of the target asset. There-
fore, they have no reason to behave diﬀerently toward the
experimental asset than to a ”real” asset. However, in the
CF methodology, the value of the asset as perceived by the
custodian might inﬂuence the result of the tests, as the em-
ployee may be more likely to give the asset away if she knows
it is not critical. As future work, we plan to investigate the
eﬀect of the perceived importance of the asset on the results
of such tests.
7. CONCLUSION
Securing an organization requires penetration testing on
the IT security, the physical security of the location where
the IT systems are situated, as well as evaluating the secu-
rity awareness of the employees who work with these sys-
tems. We presented two methodologies for penetration test-
ing using social engineering. The custodian-focused method-
ology improves on the environment-focused methodology in
many aspects. However, the environment-focused method-
ology is more reliable, does not deceive the custodian and
fully debriefs all actors in the test. We provide criteria to
help organizations decide which methodology is more appro-
priate for their environment. We evaluated both method-
ologies through analysis of their structure against a set of
requirements and through qualitative research methods by
performing a number of penetration tests ourselves. This
paper shows that physical penetration tests using social en-
gineering can reduce the impact on employees in the orga-
nization, and provide meaningful and useful information on
the security posture of the organization.
In the future, we will focus on two topics. First, we want
to investigate the eﬀect of the perceived importance of the
asset on the results of the test. We plan to separate the
custodians in two groups and inform one of the groups that
the laptop contains information critical for the organization.
Second, we want to investigate the aspect of safety for both
the employees and the testers. This research will help pen-
etration testers perform tests in potentially hazardous envi-
ronment, such as chemical or nuclear laboratories.
