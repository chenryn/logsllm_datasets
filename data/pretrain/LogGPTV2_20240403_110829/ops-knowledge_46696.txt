User: How to use an SSH key pair to log into a Linux server without entering a password?
Assistant: To log into a Linux server without entering a password, you can use an SSH key pair for authentication. The following are the steps to use an SSH key pair: 1. Generate an SSH key pair. On your local computer, open a terminal window and enter the following command: ```ssh-keygen``` This will generate SSH public and private keys. By default, they will be saved in the local directory ~/.ssh/. 2. Copy the public key to the remote server. On your local machine, use the following command to copy the public key to the remote server: ```ssh-copy-id username@remote_host``` This will add the public key to the remote server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file. 3. Test the SSH connection. You can now test your SSH connection with the following command, and if everything is configured correctly, you will be able to log in to the remote server without entering a password: ```ssh username@remote_host``` 4. (Optional) Disable password authentication . For added security, you can disable password authentication on the server and only have SSH key pairs used for authentication. To do this, edit the SSH configuration file on the remote server, adding the following line to the end: ```PasswordAuthentication no``` and restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect.
