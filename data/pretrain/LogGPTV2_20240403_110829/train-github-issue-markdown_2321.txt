Hi,
I just noticed that the nodes on our (AWS) cluster also have the region in the
zone label:
    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=eu-west-1
    failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=eu-west-1a
This doesn't make sense to me as it prevents you from using the zone label as
a selector without knowing the region upfront (which is not always the case).
If for example you want to duplicate a k8s cluster on a different region it
would require me to edit the manifest and change the zone label everywhere to
contain the new region.
So say you have 2 nodes in separate availability zones and want to deploy a
pod in availability zone **a** I would expect to just specify the zone as
**a**
        nodeSelector:
            failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=a
If for some reason I need to also specify the region you can alway use the
_failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region_ label.
