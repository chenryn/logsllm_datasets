### Preventing Attackers from Exploiting Knowledge Gaps

1. **Knowledge Manipulation**: How can we prevent attackers from exploiting or manipulating gaps in their knowledge?
2. **Network Topology for Scalability**: If the number of servers is too large for each server to constantly communicate with every other, which non-clique topology should the network use? Restricted-route topologies offer comparable anonymity with better scalability [13]. However, regardless of the chosen topology, we need mechanisms to prevent attackers from manipulating their position within it [21].
3. **Server Reliability**: In the absence of a central authority tracking server reliability, how can we ensure that unreliable servers do not make the network unusable?
4. **Client Incentives**: Do clients receive sufficient anonymity from running their own Onion Routers (ORs) that we can expect them all to do so [1], or do we need another incentive structure to motivate them? Tarzan and MorphMix present possible solutions.

### Node Failure and Anonymity

When a Tor node goes down, all its circuits (and thus streams) must break. Will this brittleness cause users to abandon the system? How effective is the method in Section 6.1 at allowing streams to survive node failure? If affected users immediately rebuild circuits, how much anonymity is lost? The problem seems even more severe in a peer-to-peer environment, where there is no incentive for peers to stay connected after retrieving content, leading to a higher churn rate.

### Future Directions

Tor integrates many innovations into a unified, deployable system. The next immediate steps include:

#### Scalability
Tor's emphasis on deployability and design simplicity has led to the adoption of a clique topology, semi-centralized directories, and a full-network-visibility model for client knowledge. These properties will not scale past a few hundred servers. Section 9 describes some promising approaches, but more deployment experience is needed to understand the relative importance of these bottlenecks.

#### Bandwidth Classes
This paper assumes that all ORs have good bandwidth and latency. Instead, we should adopt the MorphMix model, where nodes advertise their bandwidth level (DSL, T1, T3), and Alice avoids bottlenecks by choosing nodes that match or exceed her bandwidth. This way, DSL users can usefully join the Tor network.

#### Incentives
Volunteers who run nodes are rewarded with publicity and possibly better anonymity [1]. More nodes mean increased scalability, and more users can mean more anonymity. We need to continue examining the incentive structures for participating in Tor. Additionally, we need to explore more approaches to limiting abuse and understand why most people do not bother using privacy systems.

#### Cover Traffic
Currently, Tor omits cover traffic due to its performance and bandwidth costs, although its security benefits are not well understood. More research is needed on link-level and long-range cover traffic to determine whether simple padding methods offer provable protection against our chosen adversary.

#### Caching at Exit Nodes
Perhaps each exit node should run a caching web proxy [47] to improve anonymity for cached pages (Alice’s request never leaves the Tor network), increase speed, and reduce bandwidth cost. However, forward security is weakened because caches constitute a record of retrieved files. We must find the right balance between usability and security.

#### Better Directory Distribution
Clients currently download a description of the entire network every 15 minutes. As the state grows larger and the number of clients increases, we may need a solution where clients receive incremental updates to directory state. More generally, we must find more scalable yet practical ways to distribute up-to-date snapshots of network status without introducing new attacks.

#### Further Specification Review
Our public byte-level specification [20] needs external review. We hope that as Tor is deployed, more people will examine its specification.

#### Multisystem Interoperability
We are currently working with the designer of MorphMix to unify the specification and implementation of the common elements of our two systems. So far, this seems relatively straightforward. Interoperability will allow testing and direct comparison of the two designs for trust and scalability.

#### Wider-Scale Deployment
The original goal of Tor was to gain experience in deploying an anonymizing overlay network and learn from actual users. We are now at a point in design and development where we can start deploying a wider network. Once we have many actual users, we will be better able to evaluate our design decisions, including robustness/latency tradeoffs, performance tradeoffs (including cell size), abuse-prevention mechanisms, and overall usability.
