preventing attackers from manipulating or exploiting gaps in
their knowledge? Third, if there are too many servers for ev-
ery server to constantly communicate with every other, which
non-clique topology should the network use? (Restricted-
route topologies promise comparable anonymity with better
scalability [13], but whatever topology we choose, we need
some way to keep attackers from manipulating their posi-
tion within it [21].) Fourth, if no central authority is track-
ing server reliability, how do we stop unreliable servers from
making the network unusable? Fifth, do clients receive so
much anonymity from running their own ORs that we should
expect them all to do so [1], or do we need another incentive
structure to motivate them? Tarzan and MorphMix present
possible solutions.
When a Tor node goes down, all its circuits (and thus
streams) must break. Will users abandon the system be-
cause of this brittleness? How well does the method in Sec-
tion 6.1 allow streams to survive node failure? If affected
users rebuild circuits immediately, how much anonymity is
lost? It seems the problem is even worse in a peer-to-peer
environment—such systems don’t yet provide an incentive
for peers to stay connected when they’re done retrieving con-
tent, so we would expect a higher churn rate.
10 Future Directions
Tor brings together many innovations into a uniﬁed deploy-
able system. The next immediate steps include:
Scalability: Tor’s emphasis on deployability and design
simplicity has led us to adopt a clique topology, semi-
centralized directories, and a full-network-visibility model
for client knowledge. These properties will not scale past
a few hundred servers. Section 9 describes some promising
approaches, but more deployment experience will be helpful
in learning the relative importance of these bottlenecks.
Bandwidth classes: This paper assumes that all ORs have
good bandwidth and latency. We should instead adopt the
MorphMix model, where nodes advertise their bandwidth
level (DSL, T1, T3), and Alice avoids bottlenecks by choos-
ing nodes that match or exceed her bandwidth. In this way
DSL users can usefully join the Tor network.
Incentives: Volunteers who run nodes are rewarded with
publicity and possibly better anonymity [1]. More nodes
means increased scalability, and more users can mean more
anonymity. We need to continue examining the incentive
structures for participating in Tor. Further, we need to ex-
plore more approaches to limiting abuse, and understand why
most people don’t bother using privacy systems.
Cover trafﬁc: Currently Tor omits cover trafﬁc—its costs
in performance and bandwidth are clear but its security ben-
eﬁts are not well understood. We must pursue more research
on link-level cover trafﬁc and long-range cover trafﬁc to de-
termine whether some simple padding method offers provable
protection against our chosen adversary.
Caching at exit nodes: Perhaps each exit node should run
a caching web proxy [47], to improve anonymity for cached
pages (Alice’s request never leaves the Tor network), to im-
prove speed, and to reduce bandwidth cost. On the other
hand, forward security is weakened because caches consti-
tute a record of retrieved ﬁles. We must ﬁnd the right balance
between usability and security.
Better directory distribution: Clients currently download a
description of the entire network every 15 minutes. As the
state grows larger and clients more numerous, we may need
a solution in which clients receive incremental updates to di-
rectory state. More generally, we must ﬁnd more scalable yet
practical ways to distribute up-to-date snapshots of network
status without introducing new attacks.
Further speciﬁcation review: Our public byte-level spec-
iﬁcation [20] needs external review. We hope that as Tor is
deployed, more people will examine its speciﬁcation.
Multisystem interoperability: We are currently working
with the designer of MorphMix to unify the speciﬁcation and
implementation of the common elements of our two systems.
So far, this seems to be relatively straightforward. Interop-
erability will allow testing and direct comparison of the two
designs for trust and scalability.
Wider-scale deployment: The original goal of Tor was to
gain experience in deploying an anonymizing overlay net-
work, and learn from having actual users. We are now at a
point in design and development where we can start deploy-
ing a wider network. Once we have many actual users, we
will doubtlessly be better able to evaluate some of our design
decisions, including our robustness/latency tradeoffs, our per-
formance tradeoffs (including cell size), our abuse-prevention
mechanisms, and our overall usability.
