User: The following is 20 lines of a system log. Each line consists of a timestamp, log level, process id, relevant software component, and the log content. Think step-by-step and step and summarize this log chunk:

Assistant: This log chunk shows the kernel generating various cores over a period of several days. On June 16, a fatal error was encountered with the app. On June 17, an instruction cache parity error was corrected. On June 18, a CE sym 2 was encountered. The log ends on June 20 with the kernel generating multiple cores.
