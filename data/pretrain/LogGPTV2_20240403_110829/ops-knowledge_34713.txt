User: In Google Appengine, I'm interested in pickling an object and storing it in the datastore. I don't need to index it.
Is there any difference if I store it as a BlobProperty or TextProperty? Which one is better?
Assistant: Never mind. I just ran tests with both. It appears that you cannot use TextProperty with pickle. It will cause errors. Using it with BlobProperty, on the other hand, works perfectly.
