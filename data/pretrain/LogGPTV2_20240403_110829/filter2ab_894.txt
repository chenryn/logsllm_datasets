**ATT&CK ID:** T1027.010  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Command Obfuscation

Adversaries may employ command obfuscation to hinder detection during the execution of commands. This technique involves making the content of commands and scripts more difficult to identify and analyze through the use of various obfuscation methods. Command-line obfuscation can be incorporated into commands executed by delivered payloads, such as those delivered via phishing or drive-by compromise, or it can be used interactively through a Command and Scripting Interpreter. By obfuscating commands, adversaries aim to evade signature-based detection and complicate forensic analysis.
