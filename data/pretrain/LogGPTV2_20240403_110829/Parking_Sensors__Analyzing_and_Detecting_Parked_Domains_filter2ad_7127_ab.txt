### Websites Involving Third-Party Ad Syndicators

In the modern web, it is no surprise that third-party ad syndicators are prevalent. However, there is an interesting backstory worth mentioning.

Google previously managed its own domain parking service, which operated similarly to the 15 services studied in this paper. In 2012, Google ceased its hosted parking service [4], possibly due to typosquatting lawsuits such as Vulcan Golf, LLC v. Google, Inc. [10]. In this lawsuit, the plaintiffs claimed that Google's parking program was a "massive scheme to generate billions of advertising dollars through the parking of domain names that are the same or substantially and confusingly similar to the plaintiffs' distinctive trade names or trademarks." In addition to stopping their own domain parking products, Google, at the time of this writing, states on their fighting spam page: “Parked domains are placeholder sites with little unique content, so Google doesn’t typically include them in search results.” [19]

The contradiction between these statements and the pervasiveness of Google as an ad-syndicator for domain parking services is evident. It is challenging to reconcile Google’s decision to exclude parked pages from its search results while still profiting as the most popular advertising syndicator in known domain parking services.

### C. Typosquatting Abuse

Prior research has established that the preferred monetization approach for domain squatters is the use of parking services [25], [31]. However, typosquatting sites are illegal under the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), which prohibits the registration and use of domain names that are identical or confusingly similar to a trademark. Therefore, domain parking services should, in principle, be cautious about people trying to park typosquatting domains.

To measure the prevalence of typosquatting in the investigated parking services, we performed several "reverse-typo" transformations on the parked domains and attempted to discover whether these transformations result in an authoritative domain. We define an authoritative domain as one that is ranked higher on the Alexa global list than its potential typosquatted version. For example, the currently parked domain vacebook.com does not belong in Alexa’s top 1 million sites and thus automatically receives the lowest possible rank. One of our reverse-typo transformations will produce facebook.com, the domain belonging to the popular social network and ranked as the second most popular website on the Internet. Since this domain is ranked higher than the parked vacebook.com, we mark the latter as a typosquatting domain.

Our transformation models were inspired by Wang et al. [31], who introduced missing-dot, character-omission, character-permutation, character-substitution, and character-insertion typo models. For some models, we had to develop the reverse operation due to their non-bidirectional properties, such as for the missing-dot and character-insertion typo models. For the missing-dot model, we used heuristics to identify where a dot should be added (e.g., adding a dot in wwwfacebook.com after the "www" sequence). Additionally, for the character-insertion model, we defined a subset called the character-duplication model, which only accounts for the accidental repetition of a character in the domain name. To reverse the character-duplication model, we identified and deduplicated sequences of repeated characters. We also discarded the "reverse-typo" character-omission model due to high chances of false positives. Finally, we introduced a TLD-substitution model, which changes the top-level domain (TLD) to another popular one, for example, from .com to .us.

We applied the reverse-typo transformations to the 8 million parked domains and found a total of 131,673 typosquatting domains (1.63%). The distribution of these domains across parking services is far from uniform. Figure 5 shows the percentage of typosquatting abuse for each studied service. TrafficZ is the only service with no typosquatting domains in its observed portfolio. The service with the highest relative presence is Above, with over 4%, followed by DomainSponsor and RookMedia. A positive finding is that the most popular parking services, as listed in Figure 2, are also the services with less than average typosquatting abuse.

### D. Parking a Typosquatting Domain

In the previous section, we established that typosquatting domains are not rare on the investigated domain parking services. In this section, we approach the problem from the opposite side. Instead of identifying parked typosquatting domains, we aim to quantify the "hurdles" that domain squatters must overcome to successfully park their domain names. Specifically, we assess the parking services' selectiveness in excluding obviously abusive domains.

With explicit permission from the authoritative company, we registered a typosquatting domain of a high-profile and well-known website, stackoverflow.com. At the time of writing (July 2014), this website was the 53rd most popular website in the world, according to Alexa. More specifically, we registered a character-permutation typo domain, stcakoverflow.com, and attempted to park it with each service on which we managed to register an account. During this process, we discovered that the domain name was owned by a typosquatter in the past: it was registered from August 2012 until it expired a year later. During that time, the domain was parked with four of the services under analysis. Since these services already had a record of this domain name belonging to a different user, they required an extra "verification" step. The verification simply involved emailing the support and optionally sending a screenshot of our registrar’s account details. Even with the extra attention of a verification step involving a human operator verifying our screenshots, not a single service denied the submission of this abusive domain. Every service hosted the typosquatting domain for at least a week, until we transferred it to the next one. According to the services' statistics, the parking page was receiving visitors daily.

While our experience with the process of parking a single typosquatting domain does not necessarily generalize to the parking of hundreds of abusive domains, it aligns with the findings of the aforementioned domain-squatting studies, indicating that taking advantage of squatting domains appears to be part of the everyday operations of domain parking services.

### E. Trademark Abuse

While typosquatting domains fall under the category of trademark abuse, not every domain that abuses trademarks is necessarily a typosquatting domain. Consider, for example, the currently parked domain facebookonline.com. This domain clearly abuses Facebook’s trademark but would never be automatically generated by the aforementioned typosquatting models. Historically, such abusive domains have been called "cousin domains" [21] and are often associated with phishing, as it is unlikely that an everyday user of the web will think that facebookonline.com is not associated with facebook.com.

As in earlier sections, we used sampling to manage the large amount of data. We randomly selected 500 parked domains, manually extracted each domain’s distinct keywords (e.g., the words "facebook" and "online" for the aforementioned example), and queried a popular search engine for these keywords. If the results revealed the presence of an obviously similarly named website or organization, we marked the domain as abusive.

Out of the 500 investigated parked domains, 79 (16% ± 3.2%) domains were clearly abusing trademarks of existing companies and websites. Specifically, in 44 (9% ± 2.5%) cases, the domains were found to be typosquatting, while in the remaining 35 (7% ± 2.2%), the domains obviously contained trademarks. The percentage of typosquatting domains is significantly larger than the one we automatically calculated in Section III-C, suggesting that our typosquatting models provided a very conservative estimate of the problem. The reason for this discrepancy is that the typosquatting models we used do not cover all typographical errors abused in the wild. For instance, in our manual sample, we noticed the abuse of homonyms, e.g., theheneryford.org abusing the authoritative thehenryford.org, as well as character-omission typos, which were excluded from our earlier analysis.

To gain insights into the type of advertisements that end up on trademark-abusing domains, we also closely examined the ads captured by our crawlers. There, we found that 29 (6% ± 2%) of domains abusing existing trademarks displayed advertisements of a competitor. This means that when a user lands on such a trademark-abusive domain, not only would the trademark holder "lose" that user’s visit, but the user could potentially end up on a website of a competing company. Given the presence of advertising syndicators and automatically computed advertisements based on the keywords in a domain name, we can relatively safely conclude that the blame here lies with the domain parking service, which did not check whether the domain was abusing trademarks, rather than with the competitor who ended up receiving the user.

### F. Malicious Redirections

Domain parking companies claim to provide a legitimate service that helps visitors by showing them relevant advertising links [22]. While this can be true for domains without any trademark or typosquatting issues, another phenomenon makes us even more skeptical about the goodwill of domain parking services.

Out of our initial 3,000 randomly sampled pages, our instrumented browser was redirected to a different domain in 7% ± 0.9% of the cases, a feature of parking services called Pay-Per-Redirect (PPR) [15]. Note that our crawler never clicks on any advertising links, so the redirection can be fully attributed to the domain parking service. In a preliminary examination of these redirections, we witnessed landings on dubious websites, including malware, scams, and affiliate abuse.

To examine this phenomenon more thoroughly, we sampled 100 domains from each parking service and set up an additional crawler that crawled them daily for a week. During this crawl, we recorded the entire redirection chain, visited and downloaded all links present on the final page, and kept track of all downloaded data and files. To assess any geographical differences, we performed this crawl in parallel from the United States and one country in Europe. Table II shows that ten out of fifteen studied services are conducting malicious redirections.

Figure 6 summarizes the redirection chains of seven services that were found to redirect to malware-laden websites. The graph shows that many intermediate parties are involved in leading a visitor to a malicious website, and several nodes account for redirections of multiple services, such as zeroredirect2.com. These complex chains may be the consequence of a process similar to ad arbitration, a widely adopted practice performed by most ad syndicators [33]. During this process, the syndicator bids on available ad slots of other publishers or syndicators, allowing them to resell these slots to the next bidder. Often, ad slots are subjected to multiple iterations of this reselling process, meaning that ad slots are no longer under the control of the syndicator that the original publisher partnered with. All these interactions and intermediate parties have the potential to blur the direct involvement of the parking service in serving malware. In some cases, however, we also see malware being delivered more directly, for example, by the parent company of Parking Service 8.

In terms of scams, we encountered several different kinds of campaigns. In one campaign spanning eight different domains, the advertiser was trying to persuade users to hand over highly sensitive information, such as their Social Security Number, to allegedly retrieve the user’s creditworthiness. In one particular case, typosquatting domains, such as banjofamerica.com, were used to increase the credibility of the scam. The displayed page had a special notice for "Bank of America visitors" warning them to urgently check their credit score because of a security breach.

Another kind of scam, found in two campaigns residing on three domains, claims that the visitor’s computer is infected with malware. The web page insists on calling a given phone number for support. An example of this is depicted in Figure 7, which abuses the Norton logo to increase its trustworthiness. We called two of these numbers, pretending to be a clueless victim. Both "support lines" offered us assistance for the bogus infection. They required us to install a remote desktop application and inspected our machine for malware. For the purposes of this experiment, we set up a virtual machine running Microsoft Windows XP and installed a handful of popular desktop applications. Since we had just created these virtual machines for our experiment, we are confident that no malware was present on our systems.

The two "technicians" who were given remote access to our machine used similar social engineering techniques to try to convince us that our computer was infected with malware. Specifically, they inspected our list of processes and showed us completely benign warnings from the Windows Event Viewer log, which they claimed were there because of malware. One service offered to remove this malware for $150, while the other asked for $250, plus another $250 to install antivirus software [3]. Other scams involved the user’s participation in surveys, which convinced users to disclose their sensitive information by promising them high-value coupons for big box stores, which, somewhat predictably, are never delivered.

When considering both regions, all ten services were found to redirect to malware or scams at some point during those seven days.

Finally, the last category of observed malicious redirections leads to adult websites. We encountered seven domains hosting pornographic content. As seen in Table II, such redirections were most prevalent in our European crawler. Seven of the parked domains that redirected to adult material originated from adult-oriented parked domain names, specifically those parked with Parking Service 5 and 6. We assume users expect to be exposed to adult content when typing in such domain names, so these redirections were considered non-malicious. However, the other 42 parked domains that automatically redirected to pages with sexually explicit content were either unrelated or even completely inappropriate, such as southwestairlanes.com and arabianmarriage.com, and thus considered as malicious redirections.

Overall, while malicious advertisers are ultimately responsible for malicious ads, one cannot fully excuse the domain parking services involved in putting users in harm’s way. The large percentages of discovered abuse suggest either a complete lack of countermeasures against malicious advertising or the presence of very ineffective ones. Moreover, given the way some of these scams were set up, it would be really hard to successfully press charges against these services. For instance, in the scam involving virus warnings, the user voluntarily calls their support centers and gives them access to their machine. These kinds of scams show that legislation is not always sufficient to protect or compensate users, highlighting the necessity of technological countermeasures and user education.

### G. Detecting and Bypassing Ad-Blockers

Today, some of the most popular extensions in browser markets are ad-blocking extensions. These extensions typically operate by scanning each web page against a blacklist of advertising-related regular expressions and preventing the matched content from being loaded. Since domain parking services mostly rely on visitors clicking on, usually omnipresent, advertisements for their revenue, the adoption of these tools poses a significant challenge.
