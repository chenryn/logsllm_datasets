in the modern web, this comes as no surprise, there is an
interesting back story that is worth mentioning.
Google used to manage their own domain parking service,
that was operating in a fashion similar to the 15 services
studied in this paper. In 2012, Google ceased their own hosted
parking service [4], possibly due to typosquatting lawsuits such
as Vulcan Golf, LLC v. Google, Inc. [10]. In this lawsuit,
the plaintiffs claimed the Google’s parking program as a
“massive scheme to generate billions of advertising dollars
through the parking of domain names that are the same
as or substantially and confusingly similar to the plaintiffs’
distinctive trade names or trademarks.” In addition to stopping
their own domain parking products, Google is, at the time of
this writing, stating on their ﬁghting spam page that: “Parked
domains are placeholder sites with little unique content, so
Google doesn’t typically include them in search results.” [19]
One can easily spot the contradiction of these statements
when compared to the pervasiveness of Google as an ad-
syndicator for domain parking services. We thus ﬁnd it hard to
reconcile Google’s decision to keep parked pages away from
its search results, while still proﬁting by being the most popular
advertising syndicator in known domain parking services.
C. Typosquatting abuse
Prior research investigating the phenomenon of typosquat-
ting has established that the preferred monetization approach of
domain squatters is the use of parking services [25], [31]. Yet
typosquatting sites are illegal under the Anti-Cybersquatting
Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), which prohibits registration
and use of domain names that are identical or confusingly
similar to a trademark. As such, a domain parking service
should, in principle, always be wary of people trying to park
typosquatting domains.
In order to measure the prevalence of typosquatting in
the investigated parking services, we perform several “reverse-
typo” transformations on the parked domains and attempt to
discover whether these transformation result in an authoritative
domain. We deﬁne an authoritative domain, as a domain that
is ranked higher on the Alexa global list than its potential
typosquatted version. Consider, for instance,
the currently
parked domain vacebook.com. This website does not belong
in Alexa’s top 1 million sites thus it automatically receives the
lowest possible rank. One of our reverse-typo transformations
will produce facebook.com,
the domain belonging to the
popular social network and ranked as the second most popular
website of the Internet. Since this domain is ranked higher than
the parked vacebook.com, we automatically mark the latter as
a typosquatting domain.
adjacent
Our transformation models were mainly inspired by Wang
et al. [31], which introduced missing-dot, character-omission,
character-permutation,
character-substitution and
character-insertion typo models. For some models, we had
to develop the reverse operation, because of
their non-
bidirectional properties, such as for
the missing-dot and
character-insertion typo models. For the missing-dot model, we
used heuristics to identify the place where a dot has to be added
(e.g. add a dot in wwwfacebook.com after the “www” se-
quence of characters). Additionally, for the character-insertion
model we deﬁned a subset, namely, the character-duplication
model, which only takes into account the accidental repetition
of a character in the domain name. In order to reverse the
character-duplication model, we had to identify a sequence
of repeated characters and deduplicate them. Furthermore, we
chose to discard the “reverse-typo” character-omission model
due to high chances of false positives. Finally, in addition to the
aforementioned models, we also introduced a TLD-substitution
model which changes the top-level domain (TLD) with another
popular one, for example from com to us.
We applied the reverse-typo transformations to the 8 mil-
lion parked domains and found a total of 131,673 typosquatting
domains (1.63%). The distribution, however, of these domains
across parking services is anything but uniform. Figure 5
shows the percentage of typosquatting abuse for each studied
service. TrafﬁcZ is the only service with no typosquatting
domains in its observed portfolio. The service with the biggest
relative presence is Above with over 4%, followed by Domain-
Sponsor and RookMedia. A positive ﬁnding is that the most
popular parking services, as listed in Fig. 2 are also the services
with less than average typosquatting abuse.

Parking a Typosquatting Domain
In the previous section we established that unfortunately,
typosquatting domains are by no means rare on the investigated
domain parking services. In this section, we approach the prob-
lem from the opposite side. Instead of trying to identify parked
typosquatting domains, we want to quantify the “hurdles” that
domain squatters have to go through in order to successfully
park their domain names, i.e., we try to assess the parking
services’ selectiveness in terms of excluding obviously abusive
domains.
With explicit permission of the authoritative company, we
register a typosquatting domain of a high proﬁle and well
known website, stackoverﬂow.com. At the time of writing (July
2014), this website is the 53rd most popular website in the
world, according to Alexa. More speciﬁcally, we registered a
character-permutation typo domain, namely stcakoverﬂow.com
which we then attempted to park with each service on which
we managed to register an account. During this process, we
discovered that the domain name was owned by a typosquatter
in the past: it was registered from August 2012 until it expired
a year later. During that time, the domain was parked with
four of the services under analysis. Since these services had
already record of this domain name belonging to a different
user, they required an extra “veriﬁcation” step. The veriﬁcation
simply involved emailing the support and optionally sending
a screenshot of our registrar’s account details. Even with the
extra attention of a veriﬁcation step involving a human operator
verifying our screenshots, not a single service denied the
submission of this abusive domain. Every service hosted the
typosquatting domain for at least a week, until we transferred
it to the next one. According to the services’ statistics, the
parking page was receiving visitors daily.
While our experience with the process of parking a single
typosquatting domain does not necessarily generalize to the
parking of hundreds of abusive domains, they are in line with
the ﬁndings of the aforementioned domain-squatting studies,
namely, that for domain parking services, taking advantage
of squatting domains appears to be part of their everyday
operations.
E. Trademark abuse
While typosquatting domains belong to the trademark
abuse category, not every domain that abuses trademarks is
necessarily a typosquatting domain. Consider, for example,
the currently parked domain facebookonline.com. This domain
clearly abuses on Facebook’s trademark, yet it would never be
automatically generated by the aforementioned typosquatting
models. Historically, such abusive domains have been called
“cousin domains” [21] and have been often associated with
phishing since it is unlikely that an everyday user of the
web will think that facebookonline.com is not associated with
facebook.com.
As done in the earlier sections, we again make use of
sampling to cope with the large amount of data. That is, we
randomly selected 500 parked domains, manually extracted
each domain’s distinct keywords (e.g. the words facebook
and online for the aforementioned example) and queried
a popular search engine for these keywords. If the results
revealed the presence of an obviously similarly named website
or organization, we mark the domain as abusive.
Out of
the 500 investigated parked domains, 79
(16%±3.2%) domains were clearly abusing trademarks of
existing companies and websites.
More speciﬁcally, in 44 (9%±2.5%) of the cases, the do-
mains were found to be typosquatting, while in the remaining
35 (7%±2.2%), the domains obviously contained trademarks.
The percentage of typosquatting domains is signiﬁcantly larger
than the one that we automatically calculated in Section III-C
suggesting that our typosquatting models provided a very
conservative estimate of the magnitude of the problem. The
reason for this discrepancy is that the typosquatting models that
we used, do not cover all typographical errors abused in the
wild. For instance, in our manual sample we noticed the abuse
of homonyms, e.g., theheneryford.org abusing the authoritative
thehenryford.org as well as character-omission typos which
were excluded from our earlier analysis.
To gain insights on what type of advertisements end up
on trademark-abusing domains, we also looked closely at
the ads captured by our crawlers. There, we found that 29
(6%±2%) of domains abusing existing trademarks, displayed
advertisements of a competitor. This means that when a
user lands on such a trademark-abusive domain, not only
would the trademark holder “lose” that user’s visit, but the
user could potentially end up on a website of a competing
company. Given the presence of advertising syndicators and
automatically computed advertisements based on the keywords
in a domain name, we can relatively safely conclude that the
blame here is with the domain parking service which did not
check whether the domain was abusing trademarks, rather than
with the competitor who ended up receiving the user.
F. Malicious redirections
Domain parking companies state that they provide a le-
gitimate service that help visitors by showing them relevant
advertising links [22]. While this can be true for domains
without any trademark or typosquatting issues, there is another
phenomenon that makes us even more skeptical about the
goodwill of domain parking services.
Out of our initial 3,000 randomly sampled pages, our
instrumented browser was redirected to a different domain
in 7%±0.9% of the cases, a feature of parking services that
is called Pay-Per-Redirect (PPR) [15]. Note that our crawler
never clicks on any advertising links thus the redirection can be
fully attributed to the domain parking service. In a preliminary
examination of these redirections, we witness the landing on
dubious websites including, among others, malware, scams,
and afﬁliate abuse.
In order to examine this phenomenon more thoroughly, we
sampled 100 domains from each parking service and setup
an additional crawler which crawled them daily for a week.
During this crawl, we recorded the entire redirection chain,
visited and downloaded all links present on the ﬁnal page,
and kept track of all downloaded data and ﬁles. To assess any
geographical differences, we performed this crawl in parallel
from the United States and one country from Europe. Table II
shows that ten out of ﬁfteen studied services are conducting
6
ads was also recently observed Nikiforakis et al. [29] who
studied malicious advertising in the context of ad-based URL
shortening services.
Figure 6 summarizes the redirection chains of seven ser-
vices that have been found to redirect
to malware-laden
websites. The graph shows that many intermediate parties are
involved in leading a visitor to a malicious website and several
nodes account for redirections of multiple services, such as
zeroredirect2.com. Possibly, these complex chains are
the consequence of a process similar to ad arbitration, a widely
adopted practice performed by most ad syndicators [33].
During this process, the syndicator bids on available ad slots
of other publishers or syndicators, allowing them to resell
these slots to the next bidder. Often, ad slots are subjected to
multiple iterations of this reselling process. As a consequence,
ad slots are no longer under control of the syndicator that
the original publisher partnered with. All these interactions
and intermediate parties have the potential to blur the direct
involvement of the parking service in serving malware. In
some cases, however, we also see malware being delivered
more directly, for example, by the parent company of Parking
Service 8.
In terms of scams, we encountered several different kinds
of campaigns. In one campaign, spanning eight different do-
mains, the advertiser was trying to persuade users to hand
over highly sensitive information, such as their Social Se-
curity Number, to allegedly retrieve the user’s creditworthi-
ness. In one particular case, typosquatting domains, such as
banjofamerica.com, were used to increase the credibility of the
scam. The displayed page had a special notice for “Bank of
America visitors” warning them to urgently check their credit
score because of a security breach.
Another kind of scam, of which we found two campaigns
residing on three domains, claims that the visitor’s computer is
infected with malware. The web page insists on calling a given
phone number for support. An example of this is depicted
in Figure 7, which abuses the Norton logo to increase its
trustworthiness. We called two of these numbers, pretending to
be a clueless victim. Both “support lines” offered us assistance
for the bogus infection. They required us to install a remote
desktop application and inspected our machine for malware.
For the purposes of this experiment, we setup a virtual machine
running Microsoft Windows XP and installed a handful of
popular desktop applications. Since we had just created these
virtual machines for our experiment, we are conﬁdent that no
malware was present on our systems.
The two “technicians” who were given remote access to
our machine, used similar social engineering techniques to try
to convince us that our computer was infected with malware.
More speciﬁcally, they inspected our list of processes and
showed us completely benign warnings from the Windows
Event Viewer log, which they claimed were there because
of malware. One service offered to remove this malware for
150 USD, the other asked 250 USD, plus another 250 USD
to install antivirus software3. Other scams involved the user’s
participation in surveys which convince users to disclose their
sensitive information by promising them high value coupons

for big box stores which, somewhat predictably, are never
delivered.
When one considers both regions, all ten services were
found to redirect to malware or scams at some point during
those seven days.
Finally, the last category of observed malicious redirections
leads to adult websites. We encountered seven domains hosting
pornographic content. As seen in Table II, such redirections
were most prevalent in our European crawler. Seven of the
parked domains that redirected to adult material originated
from adult-oriented parked domain names, speciﬁcally those
parked with Parking Service 5 and 6. We assume users
expect to be exposed to adult content when typing in such
domain names, therefore, these redirections were considered
non-malicious and put
the other
42 parked domains that automatically redirected to pages
with sexually explicit content were either unrelated or even
completely inappropriate, such as southwestairlanes.com and
arabianmarriage.com and thus considered as malicious redirec-
tions.
in parenthesis. However,
Overall, while malicious advertisers are ultimately respon-
sible for malicious ads, one cannot fully excuse the domain
parking services involved in putting users in harm’s way. The
large percentages of discovered abuse suggest either a com-
plete lack of countermeasures against malicious advertising, or
the presence of very ineffective ones. Moreover, given the way
that some of these scams were set up, we think that it would be
really hard to successfully press charges against these services,
since, for instance, in the scam involving virus warnings, the
user voluntarily calls their support centers and gives them ac-
cess to his machine. These kinds of scams show that legislation
is not always sufﬁcient to protect or compensate users, and thus
highlights the necessity of technological countermeasures and
user education.
G. Detecting and Bypassing Ad-Blockers
Today, some of the most popular extensions in browser
markets are ad-blocking extensions. These extensions typi-
cally operate by scanning each web page against a black-
list of advertising-related regular expressions and prevent the
8
matched content from being loaded. Since domain parking ser-
vices mostly rely on visitors clicking on, usually omnipresent,
advertisements for their revenue, the adoption of these tools
