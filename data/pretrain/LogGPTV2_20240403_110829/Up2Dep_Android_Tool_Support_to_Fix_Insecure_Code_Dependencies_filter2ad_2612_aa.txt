### Abstract
Third-party libraries, especially outdated versions, can introduce and exacerbate security and privacy issues in Android applications. While previous research has highlighted the need for tool support to help developers avoid libraries with known vulnerabilities, no such solution has been implemented for the Android ecosystem. The feasibility and challenges of such a solution remain unclear.

In this work, we propose Up2Dep, an Android Studio extension designed to assist developers in keeping their project dependencies up-to-date and avoiding insecure libraries. To evaluate the technical feasibility of Up2Dep, we released it publicly and tested it with 56 Android developers in their daily tasks. Up2Dep provided quick-fixes for 108 outdated dependencies and 8 insecure dependencies in 34 real projects. Developers found the tool helpful, and our results also highlight the technical challenges and provide solutions and new insights.

Our findings underscore the urgent need for dedicated tool support to detect and update insecure, outdated third-party libraries in Android apps. We believe that Up2Dep represents a significant step forward in improving the security of the Android ecosystem, providing tangible benefits for app developers who can easily address outdated and insecure dependencies.

## 1. Introduction
Software developers frequently reuse existing code, often in the form of third-party libraries. These libraries are distributed through various channels, such as central repositories. However, they can introduce security and privacy risks if they contain bugs or vulnerabilities. Previous studies [16, 19, 22, 33, 38] have shown that these libraries can expose sensitive user information or contribute to cryptographic API misuse in applications. Even when fixes are available in newer versions, adoption by developers is slow [14].

Existing solutions to address outdated third-party libraries include proposals like Ogawa et al. [40], which suggested splitting app and library code and updating the latter. However, this approach requires users to reinstall the updated APK, and market stores face challenges in rolling out updates due to the tight integration of libraries into host apps [14]. Developers are best positioned to fix this problem, but they often do not update dependencies due to concerns about incompatibilities, lack of awareness, and the effort involved [19].

Current tools, such as Android Studio's Lint, inform developers about available updates but do not provide information on security vulnerabilities or compatibility. This leaves a gap between the support developers need and what is currently available. To address this, we developed Up2Dep, an Android Studio extension that helps developers upgrade their library dependencies and avoid vulnerable versions. Up2Dep analyzes public API changes and maintains a database of disclosed vulnerabilities and cryptographic API misuses.

We tested Up2Dep with 56 developers and gathered anonymized usage data. Our results show that Up2Dep helped fix 108 outdated and 8 insecure dependencies in 34 real projects. Developer feedback confirmed that 80.0% of the suggested fixes worked, and Up2Dep was considered useful. We also discovered that 13.51% of libraries have hidden security issues in transitive dependencies, which we addressed with additional features.

## 2. Related Work
### Security of Third-Party Libraries
Studies have shown that outdated software components have a higher rate of security issues [1]. For example, Lauinger et al. [32] found that 37% of 133,000 analyzed websites included at least one library with a known vulnerability. In the Android context, Backes et al. [14] found that 70.4% of libraries in their dataset were outdated, and it took developers almost a year to migrate to the latest version. Muslukhov et al. [33] and Watanabe et al. [46] also reported that many vulnerabilities in Android apps stemmed from third-party libraries.

### Tool Support for Software Developers
Previous work has proposed various tools to help developers build more secure Android apps. Some tools, like Cognicrypt [29] and CryptoGuard [42], focus on detecting cryptographic and SSL/TLS API misuses. Others, like FixDroid [39] and Coconut [34], provide real-time feedback on potential vulnerabilities and privacy issues. However, none of these tools fully support developers in keeping their project dependencies up-to-date, considering the effort, compatibility, and potential security vulnerabilities of different versions.

## 3. Up2Dep Design
Up2Dep is an Android Studio extension that facilitates the task of keeping project dependencies up-to-date and avoiding insecure library versions. We chose Android Studio because it is the officially supported IDE for Android development and is widely used by developers [19].

Up2Dep analyzes the developer's code and provides information on the changes needed when updating a library, based on public API changes. It also maintains a database of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and alerts developers if a vulnerable library version is included in their app. Up2Dep does not perform automatic patching to ensure that developers remain in control of their source code.

### Key Features
- **Dependency Analysis:** Up2Dep analyzes third-party libraries and provides information on the changes required when updating a library.
- **Vulnerability Database:** Maintains a database of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and cryptographic API misuses.
- **Quick-Fixes:** Provides quick-fixes for outdated and insecure dependencies.
- **Telemetric Data:** Gathers anonymized usage data to measure the impact and gather developer feedback.

### Evaluation
We tested Up2Dep with 56 developers and collected anonymized usage data. The results show that Up2Dep helped fix 108 outdated and 8 insecure dependencies in 34 real projects. Developer feedback indicated that 80.0% of the suggested fixes worked, and Up2Dep was considered useful. We also discovered that 13.51% of libraries had hidden security issues in transitive dependencies, which we addressed with additional features.

### Contributions
- **Extended Library Dataset:** We extended LibScout’s original library dataset by 7.5x, totaling 1,878 libraries with complete version history, and analyzed 37,402 library versions for cryptographic API misuse. This dataset is publicly available.
- **Up2Dep Extension:** Built an Android Studio extension to warn developers about vulnerable library versions and help them upgrade dependencies, considering API compatibility.
- **Technical Feasibility:** Evaluated the technical feasibility of Up2Dep with 56 developers, showing that it helped fix 108 outdated and 8 insecure dependencies. Developer feedback confirmed that 80.0% of the suggested fixes worked.
- **Hidden Security Issues:** Discovered that 13.51% of libraries had hidden security issues in transitive dependencies and developed a solution to address this problem.
- **Developer Feedback:** Results show that developers favor such support and are willing to use it in their projects, calling for further investigation into how library updatability can be improved.

## Conclusion
Up2Dep represents a significant step forward in helping Android developers keep their project dependencies up-to-date and avoid insecure libraries. Our evaluation with 56 developers showed that Up2Dep is effective and well-received. We call for the inclusion of such IDE-provided support in future Android development and further research into improving library updatability.
