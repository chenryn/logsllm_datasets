### Estimate Downlink Channel
1. **Compute Over-the-Air Downlink Channel** (Equation 9)
2. **Apply Reciprocity** [9]

### Uplink Channel and Over-the-Air Channel Representation of Signal Paths
- Frequency bands are separated by 30 MHz in commercial deployments.
- We ensure that the characteristics of our software-defined radio (SDR) based LTE testbed in the whitespace spectrum closely mirror those of commercial LTE deployments.
- Clients transmit data on only 8% of the OFDM subcarriers and send sounding reference signals once every two subframes (at most once every 2 ms, as in Verizonâ€™s LTE network configuration).
- In all tests, we co-locate our base station with one of the LTE base stations deployed on our campus to ensure that the multipath effects experienced by our R2F2 base station closely match those observed in an actual LTE deployment.

## Evaluation
- **Settings**: Experiments were conducted in both indoor and outdoor settings.
- **Base Station Location**: The base station was co-located next to an operational LTE base station in both settings.
- **Client Movement**: The client was moved to various locations across multiple buildings indoors and along streets and between buildings outdoors.
- **Testbed Layout**: Figure 6 shows the testbed with the base station marked in red and client locations marked as blue dots.
- **Experiment Design**: Multiple randomly chosen client locations were used, and the average and standard deviation of results are presented. The experiments were evenly split between outdoor and indoor locations.
- **Weather Conditions**: Experiments were conducted over three days with mostly clear weather and a consistent snow cover.
- **Metrics**: Results report both the measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the client and throughput (in Mb/s). Throughput was measured from SNR across LTE subcarriers using the effective SNR (ESNR) metric [17] with bit-rates adjusted based on the LTE standard [3, 50].

### Note
- The delay introduced by USRP SDRs (about 10 seconds) in switching frequencies limits our evaluation to static clients.
- FPGA implementations of interior-point methods (as discussed in Section 5) can converge in hundreds of microseconds [23], which is much lower than the few milliseconds of channel coherence time for typical scenarios [48].
- R2-F2's estimates rely on uplink channels from the client to the base station, rather than the last downlink channel from the base station to the client, making R2-F2's channel estimates more recent and aiding mobility.

## Results
### 8.1 Micro Benchmarks
- **Objective**: Verify if the model in Section 4 matches empirical measurements.
- **Testbed**: Described in Section 7.
- **Procedure**: The base station transmits to the client, and the client computes the ground truth channels on the downlink. The client then transmits to the base station, and the base station computes the uplink channels. R2-F2 is run on the uplink channels to infer the downlink channels.
- **Results**: Figure 7 shows the results from a representative run. The Fourier transform of the channel measurements on uplink and downlink channels is plotted with a super resolution factor of 20. The figure shows that the Fourier transforms, and hence the corresponding channels, differ significantly despite the uplink and downlink being separated by only 30 MHz. R2-F2 infers 6 different paths, and the downlink channels inferred from these paths strongly match the ground truth channels. The absolute value of the ratio of the estimated channels to the ground truth channels is close to 1, and the phase error is close to zero, indicating that the model in Section 4 captures the RF propagation in the testbed.

### 8.2 Effectiveness of Beamforming
- **Objective**: Examine whether R2-F2 can deliver the same beamforming gain as ground truth channels.
- **Testbed**: As in Figure 6.
- **Procedure**: Experiments were repeated for different client locations, with 10 measurements collected for each location. Clients were placed at distances of up to 75 meters from the base station.
- **Comparison**: Three schemes were compared:
  1. Beamforming using the channels inferred by R2-F2.
  2. Beamforming using the ground truth channels.
  3. Transmission without beamforming.
- **Results**: Figure 8(a) shows the CDF of the SNR for these three schemes. Beamforming using R2-F2 provides almost the same SNR gains as beamforming using the ground truth channels, with an average difference of only 0.7 dB. Transmitting without beamforming reduces the SNR by an average of 6.5 dB. Figure 8(b) plots the data rates associated with the SNRs for all three schemes, showing that R2-F2 can double or triple throughput, with an average increase of 1.7x. The gains are large at low to moderate SNRs but less at higher SNR.

### 8.3 Performance as a Function of Channel Separation
- **Objective**: Study R2-F2's performance as a function of the separation between uplink and downlink channels.
- **Procedure**: Experiments were repeated by changing the separation between uplink and downlink frequency bands between 10 MHz and 40 MHz within the whitespace band of frequencies.
- **Results**: Figure 8(c) plots the mean and standard deviation of the gain in SNR using R2-F2's beamforming across different separations. The gain improves with lower separation, with the highest gain achieved for a 10 MHz separation (6.55 dB). The SNR reduced very slowly with an increase in downlink-uplink separation, suggesting that R2-F2 can be used to eliminate channel feedback in networks with 20 MHz and 30 MHz separations, such as those of Verizon and AT&T.

### 8.4 Interference Nulling at Edge Clients
- **Objective**: Evaluate R2-F2's ability to reduce interference at edge clients.
- **Procedure**: The base station was set up as in Figure 6, and the client was moved to the edge of the cell to emulate a client from a neighboring cell.
- **Results**: Figure 9 shows the CDF of the interference power before and after nulling. R2-F2 dramatically reduces the interference at edge clients, reducing the average INR from 5.5 dB to 0.2 dB and the 90th percentile from 9 dB to 0.9 dB.

### 8.5 Comparison with Angle-of-Arrival Power Profile
- **Objective**: Compare R2-F2 with an AoA-based approach.
- **Procedure**: Experiments were conducted to evaluate the AoA-based approach and compare the gains achieved by R2-F2.
- **Results**: Figure 10(a) compares the CDF of the SNR achieved with the two approaches. The AoA approach increases the median SNR by 2.8 dB, while R2-F2 increases it by 6.3 dB. Figure 10(b) shows the CDF of the INR after nulling, with the median interference SNR reduced from 5.5 dB to 3.5 dB using the AoA approach, compared to 0.2 dB with R2-F2. Figure 10(c) shows simulation results indicating that with an increase in the number of antennas, the gain achieved by R2-F2 closely follows the ideal beamforming gain.
