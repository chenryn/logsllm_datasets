It appears that a recent change in the development version of NumPy (1.16.0.dev0+8aa1214) has caused a breaking issue with the `np.vstack` function, as reported in the scikit-learn repository (scikit-learn/scikit-learn#12467).

### Minimal Reproduction Case:
```python
import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)
# Output: '1.16.0.dev0+8aa1214'

try:
    result = np.vstack([0] for _ in range(3))
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

**Output:**
```
Error: need at least one array to concatenate
```

### Expected Behavior in Previous Versions:
In earlier versions of NumPy, such as 1.14.5, the same code worked as expected:

```python
import numpy as np

print(np.__version__)
# Output: '1.14.5'

result = np.vstack([0] for _ in range(3))
print(result)
```

**Output:**
```
array([[0],
       [0],
       [0]])
```

### Summary:
- **Current Version (1.16.0.dev0+8aa1214):** The `np.vstack` function raises a `ValueError` when used with a generator expression.
- **Previous Version (1.14.5):** The `np.vstack` function successfully creates a vertical stack of arrays from the generator expression.

This discrepancy indicates a potential regression or intentional change in the behavior of `np.vstack` in the latest development version of NumPy.
