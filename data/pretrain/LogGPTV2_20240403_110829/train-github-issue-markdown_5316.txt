# Bug report
When you build next.js when the index page is located in `/index/index.js`
instead of `/index.js` The client side script will not be executed when you
access `http://localhost/`.
The built index page will register with `/index` (as shown below)
    (window.__NEXT_P = window.__NEXT_P || []).push(["/index", function () {
      var e = n("gDgk");
      return {
        page: e.default || e
      }
    }])
Moving the index.js to the pages root will restore the wanted behaviour.  
It took a while for me to figure out what the actual issue is as it's working
just fine in dev mode.
## To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior, please provide code snippets or a repository:
  1. Check out https://github.com/adlk/nextjs-index-issue
  2. Run `npm install && npm run build && npm start`
  3. Check in DevTools if you have a log with `Home: component did mount`
## System information
