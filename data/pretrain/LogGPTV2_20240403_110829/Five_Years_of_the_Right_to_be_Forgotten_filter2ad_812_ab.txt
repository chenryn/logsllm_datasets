### The Question of Societal Change and the Right to Be Forgotten

The extent to which society has changed, as suggested by figures like Mark Zuckerberg, is a pertinent question. Many individuals seem content with the trade-off of sharing personal information in exchange for services and convenience, often without fully understanding the consequences of their actions. This raises legal and enforcement issues, such as whether the government should penalize those who use information that someone has voluntarily published online. The core of this debate revolves around the time-limited nature of consent for data publication.

### Privacy Protection and Data Collection

Privacy protection must be considered in the context of the data that is actually collected. This would require better monitoring by websites, which, when used correctly, can benignly aggregate information about online behavior. Initial efforts have been made to establish a search engine industry that offers services to "bury" information, making it less accessible in search results. Advanced technology could play a significant role in the future of information gathering.

### The Complex Environment for a New Fundamental Right

Given the complexity of the environment, it is essential to evaluate whether and to what extent general data protection principles can contribute to the establishment of a new fundamental right to be forgotten.

### The Right to Be Forgotten as a Promoter of Data Protection

#### Origins of Data Protection as Privacy Condensation

Over a century ago, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously stated, "Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial ills. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman." In 1890, Brandeis and Samuel Warren advocated for the right to privacy, which was intended to protect an individual's sphere of confidentiality, particularly from commercial and governmental intrusions. However, the "right to be let alone" did not encompass the right to be forgotten. It was only after World War II and the economic recovery in Europe that national governments began to address data protection issues, driven by the development of early computer systems.

#### Historical Development of Data Protection Laws

Data protection laws have evolved over the past 50 years, but their coherence with internet access rights remains limited. These laws have developed in response to specific technological advancements, leading to four distinct generations:

- **First-generation laws**: Reacted to the centralization of data in large databases, addressing the "big technical risk."
- **Second-generation laws**: Addressed the shift from large, centralized IT systems to smaller, decentralized ones.
- **Third-generation laws**: Emphasized the need for individual self-determination and participative concepts.
- **Fourth-generation laws**: Focused on sectorial data protection and data security rules, recognizing the limitations of self-determination rights.

#### Data Protection as a Cluster Concept

Privacy is at risk, but awareness is growing, and legislative activities are increasing. To establish a stable framework for a new "right to be forgotten," the sociological and philosophical foundations of privacy must be re-evaluated.

##### Foundation of Privacy Elements

According to Lisa Austin, technology creates privacy issues that challenge traditional analysis. A multi-dimensional approach is needed, encompassing physical, psychological, social, and informational dimensions of privacy. Hayden Ramsay identified five forms of privacy, including control over information, freedom from interference, inviolability, solitude, and domesticity.

##### Need for a More User-Centered Approach

The cluster concept of data protection must be realigned to prioritize user autonomy and transparency. Users need clear and understandable terms of service, and they should retain control over their personal information. Default licensing rules and context-based approaches can help preserve flexibility and ensure that individuals' information power is protected. Privacy can be understood as a bundle of interests related to information property, shaped through the legal system.

### Conclusion

The right to be forgotten is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of privacy and data protection. By considering the historical, technological, and philosophical aspects, we can develop a more robust and user-centered approach to data protection.
