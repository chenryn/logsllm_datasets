The question needs to be raised to what extent so-
ciety has changed, as assumed for example by Mark 
Zuckerberg of Facebook.37 Many people seem happy 
to make the trade-off in favor of sharing more about 
themselves in exchange for services and convenience 
(or they are at least not aware of the consequences of 
their behavior).38 The enforcement problem is also 
confronted with the (legal) question whether the

government should “punish” those who use infor-
mation that someone has voluntarily published on 
the Internet; legally, the time-oriented range of a 
given consent to publish is at stake.
17	 Privacy protection must equally be reflected against 
the background of disclosure related to data that are, 
in fact, collected. This approach would require better 
monitoring by websites; when used correctly, these 
systems benignly aggregate information about be-
havior online. Indeed, first attempts have been un-
dertaken to establish a search engine industry that 
would offer services to “bury” information which 
an Internet user may want to have forgotten so that 
it only turns up deep in any search results.39 Inso-
far, sophisticated technology could play an impor-
tant role in the information-gathering spectrum in 
the future.40
18	 As shown, the environment for a new fundamen-
tal right to be forgotten is complex. Therefore, it is 
worth evaluating whether or to what extent general 
data protection principles can contribute to the con-
cretization of such a new right.
C.  Right to Be Forgotten as 
Data Protection Promoter?
I.  Origins of Data Protection 
as Privacy Condensation
19	 Some one hundred years ago, Supreme Court Justice 
Louis Brandeis stated the famous sentence:41 “Pub-
licity is justly commended as a remedy for social and 
industrial deceases. Sunlight is said to be the best of 
disinfectants; electric light the most efficient police-
man.” Some twenty years earlier, Brandeis, together 
with Samuel Warren, advocated for the right to pri-
vacy.42 This concept, pioneered in 1890, was created 
to protect an individual’s sphere of confidentiality;43 
in particular, the right to privacy was understood 
as the “right to be let alone.”44 This right focuses 
on commercial matters, business methods in gen-
eral, and also on governmental actions.45 Some years 
later, Brandeis referred in a dissenting opinion to 
“subtler and more far-reaching means of invading 
privacy [that] have become available.”46
20	 The general legal and even philosophical approach of 
Warren/Brandeis did not immediately lead to legis-
lative actions and was mainly directed against data 
collections undertaken by governmental agencies 
and large corporations; the “right to be let alone” 
did not encompass the right to be forgotten. Mo-
reover, only after World War II and the first econo-
mic recovery in Europe did national governments 
realize that data protection issues must be tackled. 
Historically, the movement is also linked to the de-
velopment of the first big computer machines. Fur-
thermore, an obvious tension exists between data 
protection and information access: The design of the 
scope of one’s area of rights influences the other’s 
area of rights, i.e., an extension of data protection 
diminishes information access rights and vice versa. 
The following overview of the release of data pro-
tection laws as well as information access laws (as 
the other side of the information flow coin) shows 
that this interrelation has often not been properly 
taken into account.47

21	 As shown, data protection laws have developed over 
the last 50 years, and the building of coherence with 
Internet access rights is remote; moreover, seen 
from a general angle, the release of data protection 
provisions has gone along with particular techno-
logical developments; insofar, four generations of 
norms can be distinguished:49
 f First-generation laws: The legal provisions were 
a reaction to the attempt of governmental and 
private organizations to collect data in central 
databases, thereby realizing a “big technical 
risk.” 
 f Second-generation laws: Over time, data collec-
tions moved from big machines to small, de-
centralized IT equipment in governments and 
businesses. This has changed the scope of the 
2

risk potential and caused the legislator to in-
clude a broader number of entities in the regu-
latory framework. 
 f Third-generation laws: Due to increasing data col-
lection activities, the need for the constitution 
of an individual right to self-determination and 
participative concepts became apparent. 
 f Fourth-generation laws: In view of the fact that 
self-determination rights have not worked out 
as envisaged in reality, the need for sectorial 
data protection provisions – and in particular of 
data security rules – gained importance. 
22	 As a lesson from the historical developments de-
scribed above, the conclusion can be drawn that re-
liance on an individual (human) right has proven not 
to be satisfactory in all respects. In particular, the 
autonomy of the individual in respect of the use of 
his/her data cannot be considered as an uncontested 
principle. Consequently, this experience should be 
kept in mind with regard to the proposed implemen-
tation of a new “right to be forgotten.”
II.  Data Protection as a 
Cluster Concept
23	 Already 40 years ago, Arthur R. Miller described the 
risk of an assault on privacy;50 ten years ago, legal 
scholars invoked the notion of the “death of pri-
vacy.”51 Indeed, privacy is at risk; however, aware-
ness has been rising over the last few years and leg-
islative  activities  are  taking  manifold  directives. 
Nevertheless, as Anne Cheung convincingly points 
out, the Internet “requires us to re-examine privacy 
as a concept.”52 In order to come to a stable frame-
work for legal provisions and to identify the possible 
scope of a new fundamental “right to be forgotten,” 
the sociological and philosophical basis of privacy 
must be evaluated in more detail. 
1.  Foundation of Privacy Elements
24	 According to Lisa Austin, “technology creates pri-
vacy issues that appear to fall outside the bounds of 
our traditional analysis … we need to sharpen and 
deepen our understanding of traditional concerns 
regarding privacy in order to respond to these new 
situations.”53 Consequently, a multi-dimensional ap-
proach is required, and privacy must encompass “the 
ability to control and limit physical, interactional, 
psychological and informational access to the self 
or one’s group.” 54 (i) The physical dimension refers 
to how physically accessible an individual is to oth-
ers; (ii) the psychological dimension looks at an indi-
vidual’s right to decide with whom he or she shares 
personal information as well as the control of affec-
tive/cognitive inputs or outputs (e.g., non-verbal 
communication); (iii) the social dimension encom-
passes the ability to control social interactions; and 
(iv) the informational privacy dimension addresses 
an individual’s right to reveal personal information 
to another.55
25	 Recently, Hayden Ramsay identified five forms of 
privacy and analyzed them from a philosophical an-
gle:56 (i) The first privacy element refers to the con-
trol over the flow of information, in which freedom 
and individuality are not considered the only values 
of social life, but also truthfulness and practical wis-
dom; furthermore, privacy should not be limited to 
controlling information but extended to the risk of 
invasion of privacy. (ii) The second privacy element 
concerns the freedom from interference and obser-
vation; insofar, according to Ramsay, the threat of 
loss of autonomy does not adequately explain the 
meaning  of  violation  and  danger  people  experi-
ence with the most serious attacks on their privacy. 
(iii) The third privacy element looks at the mainte-
nance of a sphere of inviolability around each per-
son, which can be seen as a substantial moral good 
contrasting to the lack of respect for the value of per-
sons. (iv) The fourth privacy element constitutes the 
need for solitude as already discussed by Warren/
Brandeis. (v) The fifth privacy element can be iden-
tified in the term of “domesticity,” asking for safety 
from observation and intrusion. 
26	 In light of the many privacy elements described 
above, data protection constitutes a “complex con-
cept” requiring a consideration of these elements in 
view of their structural interrelations; consequently, 
the realization of a “cluster concept” seems to be 
unavoidable.57 Such a “clustering” of data protec-
tion should concern a concept that ranges over in-
formation, access, and expressions. Thereby, auton-
omy must play an important role, also in view of the 
possibility to adequately react to new developments. 
The multi-dimensional nature of such an approach 
looks at informational privacy, accessibility privacy, 
and expressive privacy; these three aspects need to 
be combined and condensed to theories of privacy 
that include control over information, limited ac-
cess, and personhood.58 Informational privacy refers 
to control over information, accessibility privacy fo-
cuses on central observations of physical proxim-
ity, and expressive privacy protects a realm for ex-
pressing one’s self-identity.59 In view of a new “right 
to be forgotten,” the relevant aspects of this cluster 
need to be identified, analyzed, and condensed into 
a rights structure.

2.  Need for a More User-
Centered Approach
27	 The elements described above as a “cluster concept” 
must be realigned in view of the rights-oriented ap-
preciation that data protection as a condensation of 
privacy is a “value” that needs to be understood as an 
aspect of autonomy of individuals containing both 
freedom from undue demands to conform and free-
dom to control one’s own information.60 Among the 
different constituents of privacy, autonomy is a key 
element.61 This element advocates for a more user-
centered approach encompassing a broad transpar-
ency range. When users are online, it must be clear 
what is happening, who/where personal informa-
tion is sent to, who is collecting this personal in-
formation, as well as if and how such personal in-
formation is being transferred to third parties. In 
particular, users need to be provided with under-
standable and (in light of the good faith principle) 
acceptable terms of services, including options to in-
fluence the collection of personal information.
28	 The more user-centric approach leads to theories 
looking at default licensing rules of personal infor-
mation, thus ensuring that individuals retain their 
control (and power) over their information. This 
could preserve flexibility based on accepted mech-
anisms rather than relying on complex (and some-
what rigid) legal tools.62 Another voice proposed 
focusing on the context in which information gath-
ering and dissemination takes place; insofar, rights 
protecting individuals’ information power could en-
sure that this context aspect remains connected to 
the personal data (a corollary to the purpose limita-
tion principle).63 Consequently, it is argued that the 
concept of property is sufficiently flexible and ad-
justable to work for information privacy.64 Seen from 
this angle, privacy is understood as a bundle of in-
terests related to information property that can be 
shaped through the legal system.65
29	 Another approach applies a taxonomy based on the 
transactional scenarios and distinguishes between 
information collection (surveillance, interrogation), 
information processing (aggregation, identification, 
insecurity, secondary use, exclusion), information
