Is there a reason why `read_csv` has a `usecols` and `skiprows` as arguments,
but not `skipcols` and `userows`? Is this to avoid parameter checks or
something more fundamental than that?
It would be nice to have all four options to avoid clunky inversions of the
type `usecols = columns.remove(unwanted_col)`.
