Question: If a network security consultant argues that placing detectors only at the network perimeter is sufficient for comprehensive intrusion detection, what is the best counterargument to this claim?
"A": "Detectors at the perimeter only provide limited visibility and cannot monitor internal network traffic or detect insider threats.",
"B": "Placing detectors at the perimeter is the most cost-effective approach and therefore cannot be improved upon.",
"C": "Perimeter detectors will overload the network with unnecessary traffic monitoring, causing latency issues.",
"D": "Having detectors at the perimeter can hinder the performance of the intrusion detection system due to environmental factors."
Answer: A
