ABSTRACT
The goal of CYSARM workshop is to foster collaboration among
researchers and practitioners to discuss the various facets and trade-
offs of cyber-security. In particular, how new technologies and
algorithms might impact the cyber-security of existing or future
models and systems.
CCS CONCEPTS
• Security and privacy → Intrusion/anomaly detection and
malware mitigation; Tamper-proof and tamper-resistant de-
signs; Trusted computing.

1 BACKGROUND
Cyber-security is a complex ecosystem that is based on several
contradicting requirements. For this reason, it is often defined as
an arms race between attackers and defenders: for example, when a
new security model or algorithm is devised, it could act as a double-
edged sword since it might both enhance the security posture of
a system and introduce additional vulnerabilities. Similarly, many
of the novel technological solutions that are used to improve the
security of systems and networks are also being used by those
who wish to threaten well-established algorithms and protocols.
For example, it is already known that when large-scale quantum
computers become available they will be able to break almost all
the public-key cryptographic algorithms currently in use. Security
is also about balancing several trade-offs, e.g. security vs privacy,
security vs trust, security vs usability, security vs cost, research
vs standardization, academic research vs real applications, just to
name a few. For example, while artificial intelligence provides the
ability to efficiently analyse massive data streams to detect patterns
of anomalous behaviour, it also threatens user privacy by enabling
the analysis of individual behaviours, and democratic government

by subverting opinions via electronic media. Likewise, the use of
trustworthy computing and trusted hardware: while it fortifies
systems by providing stronger security and operational assurance
guarantees, it also allows attackers to perform stealthy attacks and
could be used to damage user privacy.
2 WORKSHOP ORGANIZATION
For the second edition of the workshop, we received nine valid
submissions. Each submission was reviewed by at least four TPC
members, using a double-blind review process, and in the end three
submissions were accepted for presentation at the workshop, of
which two papers were selected as Full Papers and one paper was
accepted as Short Paper, leading to a full acceptance rate of 22.2%
and an overall acceptance rate of 33%. Submissions arrived from
researchers in fourteen countries, from a wide variety of academic
and corporate institutions. This year, based on careful consideration
of attendees’ health and safety, CYSARM 2020 took place as a virtual
event.
In addition to the presentations from the authors of the accepted
regular and short papers, this year CYSARM hosted a panel dis-
cussion with representatives of four EU H2020 project consortia
to discuss how new technologies and algorithms developed within
these projects will impact the security of future security models,
and the various trade-offs involved during their design.

2.3 About the Organizers
Liqun Chen (PI:EMAIL) is a Professor in Secure
Systems at the University of Surrey. Prior to joining Surrey in 2016,
she was a principal research scientist at Hewlett-Packard Laborato-
ries, Bristol, UK. During her 19 years working for the company, she
has obtained 64 granted US patents with 35 further applications
pending. She designed a number of the cryptographic algorithms
used in the Trusted Platform Module and also developed several
cryptographic schemes adopted by ISO/IEC and IEEE. She has pub-
lished 2 books and around 150 articles in refereed journals and
conference proceedings and edited 13 conference proceedings. Her
co-authored paper, describing direct anonymous attestation, was
given a test of time award at ACM CCS 2014. She has served as
general or program committee chairman at 16 international confer-
ences and as associate editor or member of the editorial board for
4 international journals. She has also served as editor or co-editor
for 7 international standards.
Chris Mitchell (PI:EMAIL) was appointed as Profes-
sor of Computer Science at Royal Holloway in 1990, having previ-
ously worked at Racal Comsec, Salisbury, UK (1979-85) and Hewlett-
Packard Laboratories, Bristol, UK (1985-90). At Royal Holloway he
co-founded the Information Security Group in 1990, and helped
launch the world’s first MSc in Information Security in 1992. Since
then he has taught a wide range of courses at both undergraduate
