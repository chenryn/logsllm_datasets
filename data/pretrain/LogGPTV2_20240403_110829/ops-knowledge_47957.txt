User: 请选择LogParser领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Here are some running logs
 0 04:15:43 combo check pass; user unknown
 1 12:12:34 combo check pass; user unknown
 2 14:41:58 combo There is already a security framework initialized, register_security failed.
 3 04:30:55 combo check pass; user unknown
 4 12:13:19 combo check pass; user unknown
 5 12:48:41 combo check pass; user unknown
The first three parts of the log are index, timestamp, and log level. Without considering these three parts, Here we assume that the variables in the logs are represented as '<*>', separated by spaces between tokens. What is the specific log template for the above logs?

A: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=root 和 ALERT exited abnormally with [1]
B: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*> 和 session opened for user <*> by (uid=<*>)
C: check pass; user unknown 和 There is already a security framework initialized, register_security failed.
D: authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=NODEVssh ruser= rhost=<*>  user=root 和 connection from <*> (<*>) at <*>:<*>:<*>
