ABSTRACT
End-to-end email encryption (E2EE) ensures that an email could
only be decrypted and read by its intended recipients. E2EE’s strong
security guarantee is particularly desirable for the enterprises in the
event of breaches: even if attackers break into an email server, under
E2EE no contents of emails are leaked. Meanwhile, E2EE brings
significant challenges for an enterprise to detect and filter unwanted
emails (spams and phishing emails). Most existing solutions rely
heavily on email contents (i.e., email body and attachments), which
would be difficult when email contents are encrypted. In this paper,
we investigate how to detect unwanted emails in a content-agnostic
manner, that is, without access to the contents of emails at all.
Our key observation is that the communication patterns and
relationships among internal users of an enterprise contain rich
and reliable information about benign email communications. Com-
bining such information with other metadata of emails (headers
and subjects when available), unwanted emails can be accurately
distinguished from legitimate ones without access to email contents.
Specifically, we propose two types of novel enterprise features from
enterprise email logs: sender profiling features, which capture the
patterns of past emails from external senders to internal recipients;
and enterprise graph features, which capture the co-recipient and the
sender-recipient relationships between internal users. We design a
classifier utilizing the above features along with existing meta-data
features. We run extensive experiments over a real-world enter-
prise email dataset, and show that our approach, even without any
content-based features, achieves high true positive rate of 95.2%
and low false positive rate of 0.3% with such stringent constraints.

1 INTRODUCTION
End-to-end email encryption (E2EE) ensures that emails could only
be decrypted and read by their intended recipients. As enterprises
increasingly pay attention to security and privacy and comply with
privacy regulations, E2EE’s strong security guarantee is particularly
desirable in the event of breaches: sensitive email contents would
not be leaked even if attackers break into enterprise email servers.
Several efforts have been made to design usable E2EE systems in
practice. For example, notable progress has been made to deploy
E2EE over Gmail using the browser extension called Secure Mail
for Gmail [4]. Several email services now offer E2EE [7], including
ProtonMail, Microsoft Outlook, Tutanota, MailFence, PreVeil, and
HushMail, to name just a few.
Yet, despite its strong security and privacy guarantee, E2EE
remains narrowly adopted in enterprises till today [5]. Besides
interoperability and management issues, E2EE brings significant
challenges for enterprises to detect and filter unwanted emails and
to monitor suspicious traffic [6]. By unwanted emails, we refer to
any email that is deemed as insecure, risky, or inappropriate as
defined by the policy of an enterprise, which typically includes
spams and phishing emails. Existing solutions to detect and filter
unwanted emails rely heavily on email contents to identify dis-
tinguishing indicators, e.g., malicious URLs [22], suspicious text
patterns [47], and display patterns resembling those from well-
known organizations [10]. However, all such indicators would not
be available under E2EE.
Indeed, intrusion detection over encrypted traffic (including
encrypted emails) is a pressing issue that attracts much atten-
tion from both industry and academia. One major effort is to de-
sign novel encryption schemes that allow an enterprise to search
keywords [13, 19, 27] or other patterns [15] over encrypted data.
Though with great potential, such techniques have not been adopted

in practice yet due to their current limited search capabilities and
high computation, communication, and deployment overheads.
In this paper, we investigate a different approach. We assume that
email contents are not encrypted with searchable encryption, and
thus email filtering systems could not gain any information from
encrypted email contents. Our goal is to develop techniques for
enterprises to detect unwanted emails in a content-agnostic way, i.e.,
without relying on email contents at all. This problem is inherently
challenging from several aspects. First, email contents provide rich
information, such as file attachments, URLs, and personal wording
styles, that can be used to distinguish benign emails from unwanted
ones. Prior works have shown that features derived from email
contents lead to accurate detection of different types of unwanted
emails [10, 22, 23, 34, 46–48]. It is perceivable that the effectiveness
of existing approaches could degrade significantly without such
content-based features. Second, although some existing content-
agnostic detection solutions (e.g., [18, 20]) come up with features
only based on email headers, these features are not resilient against
evasion. In particular, as email headers are prone to forgery, relying
on email header information alone is not robust when dealing with
adversaries capable of crafting evasive email headers. In fact, some
of the solutions (e.g., [18]) are only partially content-agnostic and
still rely on features indirectly derived from email contents. Third,
while sender reputation can help detect certain types of unwanted
emails (e.g., spams) when their senders are of a bad reputation (e.g.,
the senders appear in IP blacklists [1]), maintaining a large scale
server reputation service is expensive and tedious [20]. Outdated
reputation systems make the detection of unwanted emails error-
prone and evasible. Fourth, while common anti-spoofing techniques
such as SPF [25] and DKIM [14] can help identify spoofed sender
and forged emails, consistent with current adoption rates [9], we
observe that many of the emails in our dataset do not have such
protection. Hence, additional measures are necessary to identify
unwanted emails.
Meanwhile, we note that many existing works (e.g., [22, 23, 46,
47]) treat each email independently, without considering the con-
text under which emails are received or how they are related to
other emails or email lists. Typically, the training process starts
from a collection of benign and spam/phishing emails coming from
diverse and often unrelated sources (e.g., reported by users from
different organizations as well as from both working and personal
accounts). This setting is different from the enterprise setting con-
sidered in this work. Instead of dealing with arbitrary emails, we
focus on filtering incoming emails for a single enterprise. Unlike
personal email accounts, where the types of engaged communica-
tions could be extremely broad and diverse, benign emails received
by enterprise email accounts are inherently shaped by users’ roles
and their activities in an enterprise. For example, users in the same
department or working on the same project tend to receive the
same or similar emails, while it would be less likely for users who
have never communicated with each other before. In other words,
the communication patterns and relationships among internal user
accounts contain rich and reliable information about benign email
communications. Combining such communication patterns with
the meta information of emails (headers and possibly subjects), it
is possible to effectively detect unwanted emails without relying
on email contents.
In this work, we design two types of novel enterprise features to
capture important communication patterns. The first is called sender
profile features, which record diverse properties of past emails from
a sender. The intuition is that a benign sender’s emails are driven
by specific business purposes that would likely be quite different
from unwanted emails. The second type is called enterprise graph
features. These features are derived from two graphs constructed
from internal emails (i.e., emails within an enterprise only). Unlike
social network graphs [26, 43], these two graphs capture the com-
munications among internal users with respect to their co-recipient
relationship (internal users receiving the same emails) and their
sender-recipient relationship (emails between internal users). En-
terprise graph features indicate the legitimacy of an email based
on its consistency with the structures of the two graphs.
We combine the above enterprise features with existing header
and subject features in the literature and design a content-agnostic
classifier for unwanted emails in an enterprise setting. We evaluate
the accuracy of the classifier using real-world email logs collected
from a local enterprise with over 1,500 employees. The email logs
contain over 550K emails (including both external and internal ones)
collected in a one-month period. We evaluate the performance of
the classifier on the email logs under different settings to reflect
potential restrictions in an enterprise setting (e.g., when subjects
are also encrypted, and thus subject features are not available). We
further conduct experiments to compare with closely related work
in the literature.
Highlights of experimental results. Our experiments show
that, when combining header features with our novel pioneering
enterprise features, our approach results in a high performance clas-
sification model: with a low false positive rate of 0.3%, we achieve a
95.2% true positive rate. Further, we observe that, even with only en-
terprise features (i.e., without relying on email contents and email
headers), our classifier still achieves commendable performance:
with a 0.8% false positive rate, we could achieve a 95.7% true positive
rate. This result is important as it shows that, even when header and
subject features could be manipulated by attackers, our proposed
enterprise features complement them well, and thus significantly
improve the robustness of our approach.
Naturally, without access to email contents, our classifier could
not achieve the same detection accuracy as existing content-based
solutions, which in one aspect reflects the inherent challenge im-
posed by E2EE. Yet, our experimental results show that the proposed
approach is promising in addressing this challenge and it is possible
for enterprise to enjoy the strong privacy/security offered by E2EE
while effectively detecting and filtering harmful emails.
2 RELATED WORK
The problem of detecting unwanted emails has been actively studied
in both academia and industry. Quite a few approaches have been
proposed over the years. We categorize these approaches into two
types: (1) content-based techniques which rely on both email header
and body features; and (2) content-agnostic techniques which do
not rely on email contents.
2.1 Content-based Email Detection
Sheng et al. [42] extract links from an email’s content along with
the sender’s address, and compare them with a blacklist to identify
206CADUE: Content-Agnostic Detection of Unwanted Emails for Enterprise Security

phishing emails. Ho et al. [23] designs an anomaly detector to iden-
tify credential spear-phishing emails by analyzing historical email
and system logs. They rely on the presence of URLs in the email con-
tent to identify spear-phishing emails. Stringhini et al. [44] designed
a system named IDENTITYMAILER to detect spear-phishing emails
sent by compromised accounts in an enterprise. Though, similar to
our approach, IDENTITYMAILER utilizes features derived from an
account’s communication patterns, it still heavily relies on email
content features to capture a user’s writing habits, e.g., the frequent
use of certain keywords or phrases, or the use of URLs. A follow-up
work by Duman et al. [16] designs EmailProfiler to build a behavior
profile for each email sender to identify spear-phishing emails at
the recipient’s side. However, their sender profiles heavily rely on
stylometric features from email contents (199 features) in addition
to metadata from email headers (23 features). As email contents are
not accessible in our setting, these features cannot be derived from
E2EE emails.
A plethora of techniques apply advanced machine learning to
analyze email contents to detect spams and phishing emails. Among
these approaches, NLP plays a significant role to extract semantic
features [47], syntax features [34], and contextual features [48].
Vazhayil et al. [46] extract features from the email content, and train
a few classifiers including decision trees, logistic regression, and
SVM. Ho et al. [22] use random forest to detect URL-based lateral
phishing emails. Almomani et al. [10] design a neural network
based classifier to detect phishing emails. The classifier uses sixteen
features; fifteen of them are derived from email contents such as
whether the email contents include HTML and JavaScript, and
whether the pictures are used in links. Since all the above techniques
rely on email contents, they could not be applied when E2EE is
deployed in an enterprise and email contents are not accessible for
feature extraction.
2.2 Content-agnostic Email Detection
There have been a few efforts on detecting spam or phishing emails
using content-agnostic approaches. Khamis et al. [24] train an SVM
model to detect spam emails only utilizing header features. How-
ever, their features are not robust and the accuracy of the trained
model is below 90%. SNARE [20] is a system to assess the reputation
of email senders with only metadata of emails, e.g., timestamps,
the IPs of the sender and receiver machines, message length and
the number of recipients. SNARE is designed to be used by entities
who have access to a large number of emails beyond the scope
of a single enterprise, so that it can observe a large number of di-
verse spam emails to discover potential patterns. For example, the
sender IP density features and spammer time-of-day features used
in SNARE could be observed and effective when SNARE has access
to a large number of spam emails from the same spammer network.
In the enterprise setting considered in this paper, an enterprise
could only observe a smaller portion of spam emails from spam-
mers, which renders the above features not applicable. Similarly,
since SNARE is not designed for the enterprise setting, it does not
consider features about communication patterns between users.
Meanwhile, simple origin based approaches such as IP blacklisting
are not robust and hence are not reliable [38][50]. IPs are volatile
identifiers. A large fraction of unsolicited emails come from botnets
with diverse IP addresses [38]. Further, IPs may not represent the
Figure 1: An example of raw emails with content
real email senders since they may be sent from IPs behind Network
Address Translation appliances (NATs) or using proxy servers.
A recent work by Gascon et al. [18] adopts a similar setting
to ours. They build sender profiles based on the character traits
that the sender leaves in the header of benign emails, and later
mark those emails that show deviations from the profile as spoofed.
They profile all the senders to each recipient independently by hav-
ing access to the inbox of that recipient. However, their approach
targets solely at sender spoofing attacks. It cannot determine the
status of emails from new senders who have no established profiles.
Importantly, their approach is not completely content-agnostic be-
cause some of their features require access to the content, such
as the "text-quoted" and the "quoted-printable" features. In
Section 6.7, we experimentally compare our approach with theirs
and provide more insights and details.
