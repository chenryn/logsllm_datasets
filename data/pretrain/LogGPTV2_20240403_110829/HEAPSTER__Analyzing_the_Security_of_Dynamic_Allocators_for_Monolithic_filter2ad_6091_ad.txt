B. Wild Dataset
We built the wild dataset by using firmware images collected
in the wild by previous research on monolithic firmware images. In
particular, we use the collection built by Wen et al. [59] by crawling
the Google Play Store and searching for Android applications
containing firmware images for IoT devices (e.g., a smart watch
with a companion app on a mobile phone). This set contains
a total of 794 unique ARM monolithic firmware images: 769
from Nordicsemi (Nordic), and 25 from Texas Instruments (TI).
Furthermore, we use 5 more firmware images related to Fitbit [30]
fitness devices [52], for a total of 799 monolithic firmware images.
Overall, the firmware images we use in this experiment represent
an extremely heterogeneous set of different real-world applications,
as also shown in the categorization presented in Table III of the
Appendix B. The average and median size of a firmware in the
wild dataset are bigger than the ones reported for the ground-truth
dataset, 101KB and 76KB, respectively. Moreover, these firmware
samples have a bigger number of opcodes, both average ∼29
thousand and median ∼27 thousand (cf. Table V in Appendix D).
HML Identification. Developers are generally discouraged to
use HML in embedded systems code (as mentioned in Section II).
However, we find that 340 of the 799 firmware images (42%) in
the wild dataset actually include such a library. Out of these 340
samples, 253 (75%) were automatically identified by HEAPSTER,
while the remaining ones were identified by our clustering analysis.
When considering the 253 blobs identified by HEAPSTER,
we find the distribution of the basic functions (found in all but 7

TABLE II: Security evaluation of HMLs found in the ground-truth
and wild datasets. This table includes all the blobs for which we
identified an HML leveraging both HEAPSTER and the similarity
analysis with BinDiff. We group by sub-clusters of HML types
that are affected by the same set of heap vulnerability classes.
Num represents the cumulative number of firmware samples
in the grouped sub-clusters. OC/NHA/RW/AW represent the
heap vulnerability classes, while DF/FF/O/UAF the exploitation
primitives (as presented in Section III-G). The values represent the
total number of heap transitions that must be executed (including
the single exploitation primitive) to trigger the vulnerability.
