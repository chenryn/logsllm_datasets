### Wild Dataset

We constructed the wild dataset using firmware images collected from various sources. Specifically, we used the collection built by Wen et al. [59], which was obtained by crawling the Google Play Store and searching for Android applications containing firmware images for IoT devices, such as smartwatches with companion apps. This set includes a total of 794 unique ARM monolithic firmware images: 769 from Nordicsemi (Nordic) and 25 from Texas Instruments (TI). Additionally, we included 5 more firmware images related to Fitbit [30] fitness devices [52], resulting in a total of 799 monolithic firmware images.

The firmware images in this dataset represent a highly heterogeneous set of real-world applications, as detailed in Table III of Appendix B. The average and median sizes of the firmware in the wild dataset are 101KB and 76KB, respectively. These firmware samples also have a larger number of opcodes, with an average of approximately 29 thousand and a median of approximately 27 thousand (see Table V in Appendix D).

### HML Identification

Developers are generally discouraged from using high-level memory management libraries (HMLs) in embedded systems code. However, we found that 340 out of the 799 firmware images (42%) in the wild dataset include such libraries. Out of these 340 samples, 253 (75%) were automatically identified by HEAPSTER, while the remaining ones were identified through clustering analysis.

For the 253 blobs identified by HEAPSTER, we observed the distribution of basic functions (found in all but 7 samples). 

### Security Evaluation of HMLs

Table II provides a security evaluation of HMLs found in both the ground-truth and wild datasets. This table includes all the blobs for which we identified an HML, leveraging both HEAPSTER and the similarity analysis with BinDiff. We group by sub-clusters of HML types affected by the same set of heap vulnerability classes. The "Num" column represents the cumulative number of firmware samples in the grouped sub-clusters. The columns OC/NHA/RW/AW represent the heap vulnerability classes, while DF/FF/O/UAF represent the exploitation primitives (as presented in Section III-G). The values indicate the total number of heap transitions required (including the single exploitation primitive) to trigger the vulnerability.
