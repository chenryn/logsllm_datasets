User: I have a Google App Engine app where I need to store text files that are larger than 1 MB (the maximum entity size.  
I'm currently storing them in the Blobstore and I make use of the Files API for reading and writing them.  Current operations including uploading them from a user, reading them to process and update, and presenting them to a user.  Eventually, I would like to allow a user to edit them (likely as a Google doc).
Are there advantages to storing such text files in Google Cloud Storage, as a Google Doc, or in some other location instead of using the Blobstore?
Assistant: If you're already using the Files API to read and write the files, I'd recommend you use Google Cloud Storage rather than the Blobstore. GCS offers a richer RESTful API (makes it easier to do things like access control), does a number of things to accelerate serving static data, etc.
