User: I want to use OpcDaNet.dll in python, I use for that ctypes, but to be able to use the functions I'm intersted in, I have to create an instance of OpcServer Object, how can I do that with Ctypes?
thanks for your answres
Assistant: In fact,you can't create an instance of OpcServer Object if you use the moudle ctypes.Because C is not Object-Oriented language.If you use C++ to make a .dll file,you should make a C interface,in program such as extern "C",if you return an object in this .dll file,python' function can't recieve this object.If I'm not mistaken.If you really want to return an object in the dll file,maybe you can use boost.python to develop the dll file.
