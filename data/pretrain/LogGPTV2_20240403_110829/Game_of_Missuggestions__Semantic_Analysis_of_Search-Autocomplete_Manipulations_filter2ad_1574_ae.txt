and “site hosted for free by xfreehosting.com”. To identify such
semantic patterns, we grouped the manipulated suggestions
based on their content components unrelated to the semantics
of trigger (such as “by+URL”). More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst
removed all trigger phrases and their related phrases (identiﬁed
by Word2Vec) from the suggestion. Then from the remaining
suggestion content, we manually inspected the words occurring
frequently across different suggestion terms (such as “by” and
“-”). Table V illustrates the top 5 most popular patterns. These
patterns are characterized by the locations of their promotion
targets (e.g., “strongvault”, “panaceatek.com”), which tend to
appear at the beginning or the end of a suggestion, being
connected to the rest of the term through “-”, “by”,“at”, “from”,
“+” and other common conjunctions. The rest of the manipulated
suggestions carry their promotion targets in the middle of
the terms. We found that such a promotion phrase often
has a compound relation with a trigger-related phrase, such
as “how does the backup software strongvault work”, where
“strongvault” is a compound term for “backup software”.
For example, we found a malicious autocomplete campaign
sharing similar manipulation content and pattern. From our
dataset, we correlated 245 manipulated suggestions and 1,672
11
websites from their search results. These suggestions all share
the same pattern: target term +“-”+ trigger relevant content, such
as “hesna ims - internet marketing solutions”, and once their
top result items are clicked, all the redirection URLs generated
have a similar format, particularly, all including a campaign ID
“campaign id=20”. Our analysis shows that most top 20 search
results produced by these suggestions are malicious, directing
the visitors to those attack websites to download malware.
B. Autocomplete Manipulation Service
We found that manipulating suggestion has already become
a booming business, with tens of services available online.
To understand their promotion strategies and ecosystem, we
studied such services through communicating with some of
them to understand their services and purchasing the service
to promote suggestion terms. In this way, we were able to get
access to the tools they use, ﬁnd out their strategies and collect
materials for estimating their operational cost and revenues.
Manipulation techniques. We found that these services ma-
nipulate suggestions typically through two strategies: search
log pollution and search result pollution, as explicated below:
• Search log pollution. Some of service providers we contacted
(Table VI) explained to us the way they promote a given
suggestion term and the tools they use. A key strategy here is to
pollute search logs through crowd-sourcing. Speciﬁcally, these
providers often install software on their clients’ systems, which
can simulate web users’ behaviors to query search engines.
As a prominent example, Seopmb[29] is one of such tools
that performs automatic searches in one’s browser. The clients
running the tool need to pay rewards points to the provider. In
the meantime, they also get rewards by either paying for them
or running promotional tasks for others. In this way, a large
number of clients under the same provider can work together
to promote each other’s suggestion keywords.
Since the illicit practice of manipulating autocomplete
service can lead to SEO penalty [28], the service providers
often deploy evasion mechanisms to avoid being detected. For
example, Seopmb encrypts the communication between the
client and the server; also interestingly, although the provider’s
website is hosted in USA (Psychz Networks Ashburn), the
software distributed from the site communicates with a server
located in Hong Kong. Also, the providers usually hire a
lot of people from different locations with different IPs to
perform searches manually. They can even customize such
crowd-sourcing according to customers’ requests. For example,
if one wants to promote a suggestion for a speciﬁc geo-location,
the provider can ﬁnd people from that location to do the job.
To understand the effectiveness of such promotion efforts,
we purchased the service from a provider Affordable Reputation
Management[13]. This provider hired crowd-sourcing operators
around the United States to perform the search. They utilized
the crowd-sourcing manipulation strategy as follows: 1) search
for the target suggestion phrase on Google, 2) click the client’s
website and 3) click any other link from this website. In this
way, they generated real searches on Google and real visits
to the search results. We set up a website to track the visitors
with the “Referrer = google.com”, assuming most of them
working for the service provider (we only recorded the visiting

information without requiring user’s input). We found that 102
different hosts visited our websites from 78 different locations
such as California, Portland (the company’s location) and
Columbia. These visits happened through multiple platforms,
from desktops to mobile devices, and the average number of
visit was 5.4 per day. Surprisingly, the operation took effect
in just one month with our suggestion phrase ranks ﬁrst in
the autocomplete list. The service provider claimed that this
approach was difﬁcult to detect since the searches were real
and the operations performed by the crowd-sourcing operators
were unrecognizable as the normal activities.
• Search result pollution. In addition to search log pollution,
we also found that suggestions can be manipulated through
polluting search results. A potential rationale for the strategy
is that the ranking (e.g. PageRank) of the web pages with the
keyword could impact the positioning of suggestion terms on
the suggestion lists triggered by search terms [20].
In our research, we ran malware scan (Google Safebrowsing,
CleanMX and VirusTotal) on the websites retrieved from
manipulated suggestion phrases’ search result pages, and
found that 2,928 websites (related to 5.6% of suggestions)
were compromised to include manipulated suggestion phrases.
Among them, 39.1% were among Alexa Top 1 Million websites,
such as virginia.edu, liceomedi.gov.it, and ub.ac.id. Figure 6(d)
shows the cumulative distribution of their Alexa ranks.
Further, we found 120K webpages, which appeared on the
free hosting list [26], turned out to be Spam hosting related to
9% manipulated suggestions. Here we determined that a page
from the search result is Spam hosting if it looks very similar
to other pages also in the results. The similarity here was
measured by the cosine similarity between two pages (>0.98)
in terms of their content’s TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse
document frequency) vectors [39]. Taking a close look at these
pages, we discovered that several blackhat SEO techniques are
used to increase their page ranking, such as keyword stufﬁng
(i.e., the repetition of keywords in the meta tag and web page
content), link farms (i.e., constructing networks of websites
that link to each other) and trafﬁc Spam (i.e., adding unrelated
keywords to manipulate the relevance).
Trafﬁc monetization. Then we looked into how the manipu-
lated phrases are used to monetize trafﬁc. Beside commercial
promotion, we found that manipulation campaigns get proﬁts
by attracting victims to download malware or visit phishing
sites, or selling the victims’ trafﬁc through an afﬁliate program.
We observed in our study that the parties promoted by
manipulated suggestions monetize the trafﬁc through search
redirections: when a visitor clicks the link on a search result
page, she will be redirected to a different site. Such redirections
were detected by a Firefox add-on we implemented, which uses
the browser to automatically visit each link on a manipulated
suggestion’s search result pages, using google.com as the
referrer, and records all the web activities it triggers (network
requests, responses and browser events). Running the crawler,
we found that 315K pages related to 18% suggestions utilize
search redirections to monetize trafﬁc.
We further discovered several campaigns using suggestion
manipulation. These campaigns were identiﬁed from the
afﬁliation networks and afﬁliation IDs on the URLs generated
by search redirections. Such information was recovered through
ﬁnding the most common 3-grams on search redirection URLs,
which were then manually inspected to determine whether
they are afﬁliate IDs and if so, which network they belong
to. Then, we grouped the search redirection chains according
to their afﬁliate IDs. Table VII shows the top 3 afﬁliate
networks utilized by most trafﬁc campaigns. A prominent
example of such networks is alldownloads.hapc.gdn, whose
redirection doorway sites have the largest presentation (related
to 245 manipulated suggestions) in the search results for
all manipulated suggestions we detected. That network aims
to promote potentially unwanted programs (PUP), so the
adware publisher can generate pay-per-click revenues. Also, we
found that some trafﬁc abusers (promoted through suggestion
manipulation) collaborate with reputable afﬁliate network such
as admarketplace.com.
Revenue analysis. To understand the economic motives behind
the suggestion manipulation business, we analyzed the revenue
of the service providers, who proﬁt from autocomplete promo-
tion, and their customers, who proﬁt from trafﬁc monetization.
For estimating the revenue, we contacted ﬁve of them to
ﬁnd out the ﬁnancial cost and time for running a suggestion
manipulation campaign. As shown in Table VI, we found that
promoting a suggestion phrase takes from $300 to $2,500 per
month, depending on target search engines and the popularity
of the phrase. It needs 1-3 months to have the suggestion visible

on the autocomplete results. Hence, the average revenue for the
service providers to successfully manipulate one suggestion is
$2,544. While it is challenging to measure proﬁtability of the
service providers directly, we have one anecdotal data point.
Through the communication with the provider iXiala, we found
that the 10K sites requested suggestion manipulation on it,
which related to a revenue of $569K per week with 465K
manipulated suggestions. At the same time, iXiala had a group
of operators, who earned a commission of $54K per week.
Hence, iXiala earned a proﬁt of around $515K per week.
As mentioned earlier, the recipient of the manipulation
service monetizes the trafﬁc from the victims who follow the
search results produced by manipulated suggestions. We utilize
the following model [48] to estimate their revenues: R(t) =
Nv(t)× Pa × Ra, where the total revenue R(t) during the time
period t is calculated from the total number of actions taken
(i.e., total number of click Nv(t) times the probability of action
after the click Pa), and the average revenue per action Ra.
The total number of clicks per manipulated suggestion
can be estimated from individual keyword’s search volumes
reported by Keywordtool API [25], a mainstream search engine
keyword research instrument adopted by many companies such
as Microsoft and eBay. From the statistics of the 189,808 ma-
nipulations indexed by Keywordtool, we found that the search
volume of manipulated suggestions is about 111 million/month
in total, 584/month per keyword on average. The average cost of
the keyword is $0.23 per click. Also for each search result page,
there is a probability 71.3% [21] for visitors to click on a result
item. Altogether, we can estimate the average revenue per month
for a service recipient who monetizes trafﬁc is $95/keyword.
Note that manipulated suggestions also indirectly monetize
trafﬁc (i.e., trafﬁc monetization through the second time of
search query after querying trigger phrases). The recipients of
the manipulation service also earn promotion proﬁt even the
victims do not conduct the second search.

VII. DISCUSSION
Limitations of Sacabuche. Like any machine learning ap-
proach, our detection in theory can be evaded by making
both search terms and search results mimic the benign ones.
For example, an adversary may utilize a trigger with similar
semantic as the legitimate search terms and pollute the trigger’s
all top 20 search results. However, this will very likely cause
the manipulated suggestion to be less attractive to the visitors
and increase the cost of the manipulation. Overall, we believe
Sacabuche signiﬁcantly raises the bar for the attack due to the
inherent semantic inconsistency between the trigger and target
as well as a set of salient features from the search results of
the manipulated terms.
Again, it’s worth to note that our detected autocompletes
are difﬁcult to be veriﬁed as manipulations. In our study, we
consider them to be missuggestions due to the exhibition of
illicit indicators as the conﬁrmed manipulated ones. Indeed, our
study shows that a large volume of the missuggested results
include unpopular services or products, which are not supposed
to appear on autocomplete, even when the context is right and
the promoted products are legitimate.
Another limitation is the lack of ground truth and the manual
efforts involved in our evaluation. To ensure our evaluation
results are trustworthy, we exerted our best efforts to collect
a reasonable size of manipulated examples posted by real
autocomplete manipulation companies. As web security experts,
we adhere to several concrete, intuitive, and easy-to-follow
guidelines (Section V) when performing manual analysis. We
also analyzed and observed other indicators like search term
patterns as side-validation for the unlabeled data. Despite all
above efforts, we admit that the validation process is laborious
and may possibly include inaccuracies.
So far our work focuses on ofﬂine analysis. Nevertheless
our low detection overhead (Table III) makes it entirely feasible
