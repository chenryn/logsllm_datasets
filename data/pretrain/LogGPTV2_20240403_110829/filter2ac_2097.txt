**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Operating System Configuration

**Description:**
To ensure that only valid password filters are registered, the filter DLLs must be located in the Windows installation directory (typically `C:\Windows\System32\`) on both domain controllers and local computers. Additionally, there should be a corresponding entry in the following registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Notification Packages
```

This configuration helps to maintain the integrity of the password filtering process and prevents unauthorized or malicious password filters from being loaded.
