more than 50% of the maximum available evidence is required
to give the nodes any incentive to revoke a suspicious node.
This can be explained by the fact that the linear IDS exceeds
a detection probability of 50% and thus the threshold to a
positive expected beneﬁt at this point. The probability that a
malicious node is revoked increases to almost 1 as the evidence
reaches 100% even if only two nodes (N = 2) are competing
to revoke the malicious node. A greater number of honest
nodes increases the chance for an early revocation. As Figure
11(a) shows, for N = 10, 70% of evidence are suﬃcient to
revoke the malicious node with a probability close to 1.
In the case of our asymptotic IDS (Fig. 11(b)), the number
of competitors has a similar inﬂuence on the agility of revoca-
tion. However, nodes revoke earlier, since the IDS exceeds a
detection probability of 50% at approximately round r = 27.
In the case of 10 competitors, 35% of the evidence is suﬃ-
cient to have a probability close to 1 that at least one of the
nodes revokes the suspect malicious node. However, 60% are
required to achieve such a high probability for N = 5 and for
N = 2 the probability for revoking the malicious node does
not exceeds 95%. This observation is in accordance with the
results from Figure 10(b) that shows a low risk appetite for
a small number of competitors.
As our analysis has shown, the agility of both IDS relies
signiﬁcantly on the number of honest nodes that compete to
revoke a malicious node. However, even for a minimum num-
ber of 2 honest nodes, the malicious node is revoked with
high probability as enough evidence is collected. These re-
sults show that our karmic-suicide revocation scheme works
in a network environment with imperfect intrusion detection
systems on the nodes’ side and furthermore with an imperfect
judgment system.

7. CONCLUSION
Figure 11 shows the probability that a malicious node is
revoked after a certain number of rounds r. Note, that we
limited the maximum available evidence in our karmic-suicide
game to 100.
In case of the linear IDS (Fig. 11(a)), a bit
In contrast to the current ad hoc networking literature for
node revocation which suggests a laissez-faire approach to re-
vocation management, we have shown how the introduction of
a TA (analogous to the type of trusted third party assumed in
300key distribution research) can aid the key revocation process
of networks and encourage more optimal revocation decision
making by honest nodes.
As part of our work, we designed a new incentive mech-
anism called karmic-suicide that encourages rational nodes
to sacriﬁce short-term personal utility in favor of longer term
gains. In doing so, we examined the inter- and intra-dependen-
cies between TA-level judgment mechanisms and node-level
revocation mechanisms to facilitate (near) optimal revocation
decision making. Following from this, we presented a game
theoretic analysis of our scheme and showed how high er-
ror rates in a node’s ability to accurately determine whether
another node is malicious can be compensated by higher net-
work densities, resulting in the rapid revocation of malicious
nodes.
Our work therefore is in agreement with various experi-
mental economic studies which have demonstrated that, when
there is contention for a public resource, the judicious applica-
tion of punishment and rewards yields an eﬃcient mechanism
of incentivizing desirable behavior [26, 2].

Appendix A
Proof of Equation 8. The probability that a single node
revokes the malicious node after the risk falls below a value
1 − E is the probability that their respective risk acceptance
value is less than or equal to 1 − E. The risk appetite value
to a take risk 1 − E can be calculated by the inverse of
the equilibrium, i.e. by b−1(1 − E). The probability that
a node chooses this risk appetite value is F (b−1(1 − E)) (by
the deﬁnition of F ). Consequently, the probability that a
single node revokes the suspect malicious node is therefore
F (b−1(1−(2·(1−en(r))−1))) = F (b−1(2−2·(1−en(r)))). Fi-
nally, the probability that at least one of N competing nodes
revoked the malicious node after a certain number of rounds
