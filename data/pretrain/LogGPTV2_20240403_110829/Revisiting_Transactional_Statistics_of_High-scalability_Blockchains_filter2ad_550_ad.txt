account, we find that only one of the 4 currencies has a
balance change of over 0.3%. The second most frequently
used account has a similar transaction pattern, with only 2
out of the 32 currencies traded showing a balance change
larger than 0.6%. The rest of the top accounts all follow
a very similar trend, with almost all the traded currencies
having almost the same sent and received amounts.
Boomerang transactions. As shown in Figure 3a, there was
a very sharp increase of activity on EOSIO after Novem-
ber 1, 2019. After investigating, we find that this increase is
due to the airdrop of a new coin called EIDOS [17].
The token distribution works as follows: Users send any
amount of EOS to the EIDOS contract address, the EIDOS
contract sends the EOS amount back to the sender and also
sends 0.01% of the EIDOS tokens it holds. This creates a
“boomerang” transaction for the EOS token and a transaction
to send the EIDOS token. The tokens can then be traded
for USDT (Tether) which can in turn be converted to other
currencies. There are no transaction fees on EOSIO and
users can execute transactions freely within the limits of
their rented CPU capacity. Therefore, this scheme incentivizes
users with idle CPU resources on EOSIO to send transactions
to this address, creating a large increase in the numbers of
transactions.
Soon after the launch of this coin, the price of CPU usage
on EOSIO spiked by 10,000% and the network entered a
congestion mode. In a normal mode, users can consume
more CPU than they staked for, but when the network is in
congestion mode, they can only consume the amount staked.
Although this is how the network is supposed to behave, it
is problematic if it lasts for a non-negligible period of time.
For example, EOS is used for games where many users make
a small number of transactions without staking CPU. When
the network enters congestion mode for a long period of time,
these users cannot continue to play unless they actively stake
EOS for CPU. This has caused some services to threaten with
their migration to another blockchain [16].
The coin seems to be operated by an entity called Enumivo
but there is very scarce information about what service it
provides. Given the very hostile tone in communications6, it is
likely that the creator indeed intended to congest the EOSIO
network. Furthermore, the entity behind the EIDOS token
seems to be willing to launch a “sidechain” of EOSIO [46].
Summary. One of the major selling points of EOSIO is its
absence of transaction fees for most users. Although this
clearly provides advantages for users, it can also result in
spamming behaviors, as observed in this section. The fee-free
transaction environment encourages market manipulation
such as the WhaleEx wash-trading; moreover, it has also
back-fired with the EIDOS token, as the network had to enter
congestion mode and users have to stake an amount much
higher than transaction fees in the Bitcoin network [16].
5.2 Governance Transactions on Tezos
One of the main particularities of Tezos, compared to other
blockchains, is its on-chain governance and self-amendment
abilities. Given that only bakers are allowed to send such
transactions and that they can only perform a limited number
of actions within a certain time frame, governance-related
transactions represent only a very small fraction of the total
number of transactions: merely 604 within our observation
period. However, given that this type of transaction is rather
unique and has, to the best of our knowledge, not been
researched before, we analyze how the different phases of the
governance process are executed in practice.

Tezos voting periods. Tezos voting is divided into four periods,
each lasting around 23 days [24]. During the first period, the
proposal period, bakers are allowed to propose an amendment
in the form of source code to be deployed as the new protocol
for Tezos. At the end of this period, the proposal with the
highest number of bakers’ votes is selected for the next period:
The exploration period. During the exploration period, the
bakers either choose to approve, refuse or abstain on voting
on the proposal. If the quorum and the minimum positive
votes—both thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on
past participation—is reached, the proposal enters the testing
period. During the testing period, the proposal is deployed on
a testing network, without affecting the main network. Finally,
the last period is the promotion vote period, which works in
the same way as the exploration period but if successful, the
new protocol is deployed as the new main network.
Analyzing Tezos Voting. To investigate the entire voting pro-
cess in Tezos, we collect extra data associated with a recent
amendment called Babylon 2.0 [13], which was proposed on
August 2, 2019 and promoted to the main network on Octo-
ber 18, 2019. We show the evolution of the votes during the
different voting phases in Figure 7.
During the proposal period, a first proposal, “Babylon”,
was submitted and slowly accumulated votes. During this
phase, the authors of Babylon received feedback from involved
parties and released an updated protocol, Babylon 2.0. Votes
can be placed on multiple proposals which is why the number
of previous votes on Babylon did not decrease. At the end
of the vote, the participation was roughly 49%. It is worth
noting that, although in practice any baker can propose an
amendment to the network, from the creation of the Tezos
blockchain up until the time of this writing, only Cryptium
Labs and Nomadic Labs, who are both supported by the
Tezos Foundation, have made successful proposals.
During the exploration period, participants can vote “yay”
to support the proposal, “nay” to reject it, or “pass” to
explicitly abstain from voting. No negative votes were cast
during this period and the only abstention was from the Tezos
Foundation, whose policy is to always abstain to leave the
decision to the community. This phase had a participation of
over 81%, significantly higher than for the previous round.
This can be explained by the fact that explicit abstention
counts as participation, while there is no way to explicitly
abstain in the proposal phase.
Finally, after the testing period during which the proposal
was deployed and tested on a testnet, the promotion period
started. The trend was mostly similar to what was observed
in the exploration period, but the number of votes against
the proposals increased from 0 to 15%, as some bakers en-
countered trouble during the testing period due to changes in
the transaction format that led to breaking components [40].
Improvement potential on voting mechanism. There are cur-
rently four periods in the Tezos voting system. First, par-
ticipants can submit proposals, then they decide whether
to try the elected proposal on a testing network and finally
whether to amend the main network using the proposal. How-
ever, at the time of writing, in every exploration period seen,
proposals have always received more than 99% approval dur-
ing the exploration period. With the only exception where
more than 99% of rejections were received [50] during the
exploration period, the participation during the proposal pe-
riod was below 1%. This shows that proposals selected by a
large enough number of participants are almost unanimously
approved in the exploration period. Although the current
voting scheme could be useful in the future, we believe this
shows that in the current state of the network, the proposal
and exploration periods could be merged. This would allow
a reduction in the time until amendments ship to the main
network without compromising the functionality or security
of the network.
5.3 Zero-value Transactions on XRPL
Payments with zero-value tokens. As described in Section 2.4,
XRPL offers autonomy in currency issuance. On the flip side,
this means that it is easy to generate seemingly high-value,
but in effect valueless and useless transactions. Currencies
bearing the same ticker issued by different accounts can have
drastically differing valuations due to the varying level of
trust in their issuers and the redeemability of their IOU

tokens, which has in the past caused confusion among less
informed users.7
In fact, the only currency whose value is recognized outside
of XRPL is its native currency XRP, which is also the only
currency that cannot be transferred in the form of IOUs. Non-
native currencies can be exchanged with each other or to XRP
via decentralized exchanges (DEX) on the ledger. Therefore,
a reliable way of evaluating a currency by a certain issuer
is to look up its exchange rate against XRP. Normally, only
IOU tokens issued by featured XRPL gateways are deemed
valuable; in contrast, tokens issued by random accounts are
most likely to be deemed worthless. For example, the value
of BTC IOUs from various issuer accounts could range from 0
to 36,050 XRP (Figure 8a).
The ledger experienced two waves of abnormally high traf-
fic in the form of Payment transactions in late 2019, the first
between the end of October and the beginning of November,
the second—at a higher level—between the end of November
and the beginning of December (Figure 3c). The culprit be-
hind the increased traffic is rpJZ5WyotdphojwMLxCr2prhULvG3Voe3X,
an account activated on October 9, 2019 which itself man-
aged to activate 5,020 new accounts within one week with a
total of 1 million XRP (roughly 250,000 USD), only to have
them perform meaningless transactions between each other,
wasting money on transaction fees. The behavior triggered
a heated debate in the XRP community where a member
claimed that the traffic imposed such a burden to their val-
idator that it had to be disconnected [53].
Ripple suspected it to be “an attempt to spam the ledger”
with little impact on the network.8 However, large exchanges
such as Binance suffered from temporary XRP withdrawal fail-
ures, who cited the XRP network congestion as the cause [5].
It remains something of a mystery how such an expensive
form of “spam” benefited its originators.

(a) Observation period: October 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020.
(b) Observation period: February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020, during which the
throughput was not polluted by systematic Payment spams.
Figure 9: XRPL throughput by transaction type, success and value
transferred. Highlighted transactions carry economic value.
The payment transactions from the spam did not carry
any value, since they involved transferring BTC IOU tokens
unacceptable outside of the spammer’s network.
To quantify true value-transferring Payment transactions,
we retrieve the exchange rate with respect to XRP of all the
issuer-specific tokens that were transferred between Octo-
ber 1, 2019 and April 30, 2020. Only 12.8% (3.3%/25.8%)
of all successful Payment transactions involve tokens with a
positive XRP rate (Figure 9a).
To obtain a picture of throughput usage uncontaminated
by systematic spam, we re-examine the transaction data
from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020. During this period,
67.9% successful Payment transactions led to value transfer
(Figure 9b). Nevertheless, the value-carrying share of total
throughput remains under 6%, since successful Payment trans-
actions only account for a small fraction (8.1%) of the overall
traffic and the majority (97.9%) of OfferCreate transactions
eventually becomes void.
In Figure 10, we show the top senders and receivers of
value-carrying Payment transactions, as well as the most pop-
ular currencies being transferred. To cluster accounts, we rely
on usernames as the identifier, as one entity can have multiple
