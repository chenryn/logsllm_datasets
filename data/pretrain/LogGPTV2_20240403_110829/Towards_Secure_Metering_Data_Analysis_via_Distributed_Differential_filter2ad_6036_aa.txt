Abstract—The future electrical grid, i.e., smart grid, will utilize
appliance-level control to provide sustainable power usage and
ﬂexible energy utilization. However, load trace monitoring for
appliance-level control poses privacy concerns with inferring
private information. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-
preserving and ﬁne-grained power load data analysis mechanism
for appliance-level peak-time load balance control in the smart
grid. The proposed technique provides rigorous provable privacy
and an accuracy guarantee based on distributed differential
privacy. We simulate the scheme as privacy modules in the smart
meter and the concentrator, and evaluate its performance under
a real-world power usage dataset, which validates the efﬁciency
and accuracy of the proposed scheme.
I. INTRODUCTION
The future electrical grid, i.e., smart grid, introduces in-
formation and communication technology (e.g., Advanced
Metering Infrastructure (AMI)) to the traditional electrical grid
to improve the efﬁciency and reliability of the system. Its
development has been actively driven by governments in the
United States and Europe. Given the mandatory transition to
the new generation smart grid, which has been signed into
law, 80% of consumers should be equipped with smart meters
by year 2020 in the United States [1]. Neighborhood area
network (NAN) based smart grids, as an initial smart grid
instance, plays an important role in this transition because of
the quick and lightweight communication deployment of the
NAN. The NAN, as a bi-directional online communication
infrastructure between smart meters and the concentrator,
consists of data management systems and monitoring systems
to collect metering data and to distribute control information.
It realizes the neighborhood-level meter reading collection
and control information distribution ﬂow between the utility
company and the residents.
Towards sustainable power usage and ﬂexible energy u-
tilization, many different
load control policies have been
introduced for the smart grid. Among them, appliance-level
load control policy in NAN based smart grids has begun to
receive attention. Appliance-level control policy is supported
by Non-intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) technology in
smart meters [2], where the load proﬁle is analyzed to deduce
the individual energy consumption of appliances. It allows
ﬁne-grained power consumption to be proﬁled in real time,
and enables remote diagnostics and controls to increase the
performance of the grid infrastructure. When executing the
However,
appliance-level control policy, to respond to a rapid power
consumption increase in peak time among neighborhoods, the
purpose of peak-time load balancing control for the smart grid
is to temporarily (to allow time to start up a larger generator)
or continuously (in the case of limited resources) shut down
the appliances which are not in use but connected to the circuit.
the usage of ﬁne-grained energy data for
appliance-level load control poses privacy concerns. As recent
research indicated [3], personal information can be derived
from energy consumption data, such as the individuals’ be-
haviors and locations in their houses. For instance, burglars,
who eavesdrop on the communication on the wireless link
in the NAN, could identify the time to break into the house
based on the fact that power consumption drops when the
house is vacant. Also, one who colludes with the controller
could infer the location of the residents by monitoring the
appliances being used. This kind of behavioral inference is
known as an NILM attack [2]. In addition to privacy, quality-
of-service (QoS) is also a key issue of the smart grid. Perfor-
mance degradation like response delay or output inaccuracy,
which can be introduced by the data manipulation to achieve
privacy, must be rigidly quantiﬁed for the system reliability
and stability.
In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving ﬁne-grained
power usage data analysis mechanism for the appliance-level
peak-time load balance control in the smart grid based on
distributed differential privacy. The main contributions of the
paper are summarized as follows:
• We explore the distributed top-k differential privacy
problem to propose a privacy-preserving load analysis
mechanism for appliance-level peak-time load balance
control.
• We prove that the proposed scheme achieves a rigorous
privacy guarantee called 3ε-differential privacy. Also, we
show the provable upper bound of the error rate for our
scheme.
• We demonstrate an evaluation for our scheme using a
real-world dataset. Our results indicate the efﬁciency and
validity of our scheme.
This paper proceeds as follows. We discuss the related
work in Section II. In Section III, we describe the necessary
background concepts of this work. In Section IV, we show the
problem formulation. In Section V, our approach is described
in detail. In Section VI, the security and accuracy analyses are
discussed theoretically. In Section VII, our scheme’s perfor-
mance is evaluated using a real-world dataset. In Section VIII,
the conclusion and the future work are presented.
II. RELATED WORK
Data disclosure in the smart grid is attracting increasing
attention from researchers. In particular, secure and privacy-
preserving communication and data management in the AMI
have been extensively studied. In [3], security and privacy
analyses of the Automatic Meter Reading (AMR) technology
were presented. As the authors indicated, AMR is susceptible
to a neighborhood-level NILM attack because of its lack of
basic security mechanisms, such as insecure wireless trans-
missions and the continuous broadcast of energy traces.
In order to protect
the data privacy while guaranteeing
the ability to manage the data, two types of complemen-
tary privacy-preserving approaches have been proposed: non-
cryptographic approaches and cryptographic approaches. One
promising non-cryptographic approach is Battery-based Load
hiding (BLH), which utilizes a battery to partially supply the
demand load so as to alter the meter reading. Rajagopalan
et al. [4] proposed a best effort privacy protection algorithm,
which quantiﬁed the loss of beneﬁt resulting from the privacy-
preserving approach. McLaughlin et al. [5] proposed a non-
intrusive load leveling method for BLH and performed a
rigorous physical simulation under substantial real-world data.
However, these schemes face the vulnerabilities of load peak
leakage as revealed in [6]. Accordingly, a stepping-based
framework for BLH was proposed by Yang et al. [6], which
maximized error between the demand load and external load
in load peaks. But, BLH approaches limit the ability of the
smart grid to provide appliance-level
load control. In the
cryptographic approaches category, Deng et al. [7] proposed
a secure communication scheme for AMI. Li et al. [8] pro-
posed a secure information aggregation scheme for the smart
grid. Rottondi et al. [9] proposed a privacy-preserving load
scheduling scheme to prevent the NILM attack. However, these
schemes [7]–[9] require the use of homomorphic encryption
(HE) [10]–[12] such as Paillier’s cryptosystem [12], which is
computationally expensive and far from practical. Yan et al.
[13] proposed a symmetric encryption (SE) based secure com-
munication scheme for AMI to protect from eavesdropping.
However, the approach described in [13] is not provable secu-
rity and does not support privacy-preserving data management.
As illustrated by Table I, our scheme based on differential
privacy (DP) is the most full-featured.
III. BACKGROUND
A. Differential privacy
Differential privacy has become a popular privacy method
due to its lightweight implementation and rigorous provable
security. Differential privacy was proposed by Dwork et al.
[14] in 2006, which makes no trust assumption about the
adversary.
Deﬁnition 1: (ε-differential privacy [14]) A randomized al-
gorithm A gives ε-differential privacy if for all datasets D1 and
D2 differing on at most one row, and for all S ⊆ Range(A),
P r{A(D1) ⊆ S} ≤ e
ε × P r{A(D2) ⊆ S},
where ε is the privacy budget of the randomized algorithm A.
In the deﬁnition of differential privacy, the data sets D1
and D2, which the randomized algorithm targets, differ on at
most one row. In other words, if the removal or addition of a
single user’s data does not substantially affect the result, there
is no risk for users to join and answer the query. The privacy
budget ε is the parameter to measure the privacy level of the
randomized algorithm. The choice of ε is a tradeoff between
the privacy and the accuracy of the output.
Deﬁnition 2: (Sensitivity [14]) For a function f : D → Rk,
the sensitivity of f is
Δf = max
D1,D2
(cid:5)f (D1) − f (D2)(cid:5)1,
where D1 and D2 differ on at most one row, and D1, D2 ∈ D.
Sensitivity measures the outputs’ change in the function f (),
when the targeted data set changes.
√
2Δf
ε
i.e., A(X) = f (X) + Lap( Δf
A signiﬁcant ε-differential privacy mechanism, which was
introduced by Dwork et al., is Laplace noise on counting
ε ). In Laplace
query [14],
noise on counting query, f () is a counting query on the data
set X, and Lap() is the Laplace distribution with standard
to scale the counting query result. Laplace
deviation
noise on counting query is claimed to be ε-differential pri-
vacy, because for all D1 and D2 differing on at most one
row, P r{A(D1)⊆R}
. As the sensitivity of
counting query |f (D1)− f (D2)| ≤ Δf, P r{A(D1)⊆R}
P r{A(D2)⊆R} ≤ e
−ε.
Hence, Laplace noise on counting query f (X) + Lap( Δf
ε ) is
ε-differential privacy.
P r{A(D2)⊆R} = e

consumption by analyzing changes of the load proﬁle from the
interface of the smart meter. NILM is considered a lightweight
alternative to attaching individual monitors on each appliance.
It detects an appliance’s activities such as ON/OFF events
for appliance-level load control and appliance management.
However, NILM technology can also be used by the adversary
to deduce the residents’ behavior in the house.
A one-day load proﬁle for two houses is shown in Figure 1.
Even though two houses have distinguishable diurnal patterns,
it is easy for an adversary to deduce whether the house is
vacant by observing the load proﬁles. Moreover, consumption
trace analysis can be mapped directly to ON/OFF events of
identiﬁable appliances so as to determine the location of the
resident in the house [2]. Thus, a privacy-preserving load
analysis scheme is needed for the smart grid.
IV. PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section, the system model and assumptions are given.
Then, we outline the adversary model and design goals.
A. System Model and Assumptions
We consider an instance of a NAN based smart grid system
as shown in Figure 2, which is composed of four components
including smart meters, a concentrator, a data collector and a
control center. In the NAN based smart grid system, the smart
meter of each house in the neighborhood transmits its data to
the concentrator through the NAN, which has a star topology.
3
Then, the concentrator forwards the data to the data collector.
The purpose of the concentrator is to efﬁciently forward the
data from the smart meters to the data collector. The data
collector collects and stores the data from the smart meter,
and also distributes the query from the control center to the
smart meters of each house. The control center generates
control policy based on the query answers returned from
the data collector. Our scheme introduces privacy modules
in both the smart meters and the concentrator as a blackbox
to provide privacy without modifying existing programs. We
further assume that the public key pairs are shared between the
smart meters and the control center. The smart meters utilize
the control center’s public key Kp for secure communication.
The control policy that we utilize in this work is appliance-
level peak-time load balance control, i.e., the policy is to
generate an appliance-level control
to respond to a rapid
power consumption increase among neighborhoods during
peak time. In a NAN based smart grid system, the control
center balances the load in peak time by shutting down the
appliances temporarily (to allow time to start up a larger
generator) or continuously (in the case of limited resources),
where the appliances are not in use but connected to the circuit.
Hence, the corresponding meter reading analysis is a real-time
query Qt =, where ID is the query ID, t is the
query timestamp and q is the SQL-style query request, such
as ‘SELECT k appliances WHERE they are not in use but
connected to the circuit AND t = tp IN ORDER of power
consumption’, where tp is the peak-time timestamp.
For the above smart grid architecture and control policy,
without loss of generality, we assume that the NAN (with a star
topology) has N smart meters distributed in the neighborhood.
Each smart meter in a house samples the power consumption
of appliances with the sample rate rs. Also, each smart meter
has similar storage capacity and computation power. Each
concentrator and data collector are powerful and resourceful
enough to store data and process query requests. Also, the
controller has full access to the data collector.
B. Adversary Model and Design Goals
As recent works in [4]–[6], [9], [13], we consider a similar
adversary model as follows: (1) Honest-but-curious controller
where the controller follows the designated protocol speci-
ﬁcation honestly while it is curious to analyze data in the
data collector or the concentrator so as to learn additional
information besides those obtained for control policy gen-
eration. (2) Honest-but-curious user where the user acts in
an ‘honest’ fashion to answer the query for load scheduling,
but in a ‘curious’ fashion to obtain other users’ load proﬁles
by eavesdropping the communications or colluding with the
untrusted controller. (3) Malicious eavesdropper where the
eavesdropper tries to obtain the load proﬁle on the smart grid.
To address the adversary models above, a privacy-preserving
and ﬁne-grained data analysis scheme for the smart grid
is proposed. Our scheme achieves security and performance
guarantees as follows:
• Provable Privacy: The untrusted controller does not learn
information of the residents’ load proﬁles
additional
from data collector except for those for control policy.
Moreover, other components of the smart grid or the
channel eavesdropper are unable to learn the residents’
load.
• Accuracy Guarantee: The accuracy of the query results is
quantiﬁed and bounded. In other words, the performance
degradation, which is introduced by the data manipulation
to achieve privacy, is limited.
• Performance: The above goals for privacy and accuracy
guarantees should be power efﬁcient with low response
time on the smart grid system.
V. SYSTEM FOR PEAK-TIME LOAD BALANCE
Our proposed scheme has three steps. First, when the
concentrator obtains the query request Qt from the control
center, the concentrator fuzzes the parameters of the query
(cid:4)
t to the
request, and then distributes the new query request Q
smart meters of each house. Second, the smart meter of each
(cid:4)
t, and then encrypts the query
house i answers the query Q
answer with the controller’s public key Kp. With the encrypted
query answers from each smart meter through a secure channel
such as TLS, the concentrator adds noise into the set of the
encrypted query answers, then returns k answers among them
by uniformly sampling. Finally, the controller decrypts the
query answers with its private key Ks. The challenge of the
scheme is to add the noise blindly in the concentrator while
guaranteeing the accuracy of the query answer. The details of
the scheme are as follows:
Query Initialization. A controller formulates a SQL-style
query Qt = for peak-time load balancing, where
ID is the query ID, t is the query timestamp and q is the
SQL-style query request, i.e., q = ‘SELECT k appliances
IN ORDER FROM history log WHERE p > PK and t ∈
[tpl, tph](cid:4). In query request q, p is the power consumption of an
