ABSTRACT
Identity and authentication solutions often lack usability
and scalability, or do not provide high enough authentication
assurance. The concept of Lucidman (Local User-Centric
Identity Management) is an approach to providing scalable,
secure and user friendly identity and authentication func-
tionalities. In this context we demonstrate the use of an Oﬀ-
PAD (Oﬄine Personal Authentication Device) as a trusted
device to support diﬀerent forms of authentication. The Lu-
cidman/OﬀPAD approach consists of locating the identity
management and authentication functionalities on the user
side instead of on the server side or in the cloud. This demo
aims to show how OﬀPAD strengthens authentication as-
surance, improves usability, minimizes trust requirements,
and has the advantage that trusted online interaction can
be achieved even on malware infected client platforms. The
trusted device OﬀPAD has been designed as a phone cover,
therefore not requiring the user to carry an extra gadget.
We focus on six demonstrators, three useful in e-banking
and three in the hospital domain where nurses, doctors, or
patients are authenticated and access is granted in various
situations base on the OﬀPAD. A video with the same title
is available online at www.oﬀpad.org.

1. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND
We demo the OﬀPAD concept, i.e., the hardware, a phone
cover with secure elements, and software components. The
concept of OﬀPAD has been put forward in [5], whereas the

hardware prototype and software have been developed dur-
ing the past two years part of the project called OﬀPAD.1
Several use cases have been identiﬁed to show case the Oﬀ-
PAD in the domains of e-banking and hospitals.
One aim with OﬀPAD is to increase security assurance
without reducing the usability, i.e., have minimal interfer-
ence with the normal tasks of the user, yet automate some
of the authentication related tasks. OﬀPAD can be seen as
an identity management device, assuming an entity to have
multiple identities simultaneously, similar to what ABAC
and Attribute-Based Credentials advocate. OﬀPAD aims
to improve on the traditional “silo model” where the iden-
tities are located on the server side, by managing identi-
ties locally under user’s control only. However, an OﬀPAD
maintains, besides user’s credentials, also the credentials of
service providers to be used in authenticating the service
to the user. OﬀPAD also improves on the identity feder-
ation endeavours (e.g., Shibboleth, OpenId, FacebookCon-
nect, FIDO) which are managed on servers or clouds, thus
making them “network-centric” instead of “user-centric”.
We take the distinction between a system entity (browser
or server) and a legal/cognitive entity (person or organisa-
tion) thus multiplying the mutual authentication possibili-
ties. We also consider authentication to be of three types:
(i) syntactic, being the simplest, including X.800 certiﬁcates,
which, e.g., does not prevent phishing attacks since the re-
lying party is indiﬀerent to the identity of the certiﬁcate
owner; (ii) semantic authentication includes syntactic and
moreover the veriﬁcation by the relying entity that the re-
mote entity has semantic characteristics that are compliant
with a speciﬁc security policy; and (iii) cognitive being the
richest, requiring the relying party to have cognitive reason-
ing power, such as in humans or advanced AI systems. Cog-
nitive authentication eﬀectively prevents phishing attacks
as users recognise the server identity, spotting a malicious
owner of a legitimate certiﬁcate accepted by the browser.
With OﬀPAD we are interested in cognitive authentica-
tions involving the human user.
The X.800 standard is concerned with authenticating the
Client Computer to the Server (CS) and the other way around
(SC) which take place at the network protocol layers and are
typically transparent to the human user. However, for online
services the User authentication to the Server (US) and the
cognitive server authentication by the user (SU) are more
relevant. The importance of these authentication classes
emerges from the need for end-to-end security, i.e., between
the human user (U) and the server system (S).

browser PKIX2 server certiﬁcates and TLS provides SU au-
thentication, however in reality it does not. This might seem
surprising but is in fact easy to understand [3].
For example, phishing attacks normally start with spam
emails that invite people to access a fake web site that tricks
the user into providing user Id and password. In a syntactic
sense the fake phishing website is correctly authenticated
through TLS because the server certiﬁcate is validated by
the browser. However, from a cognitive point of view this is
not authentication because the website’s identity is diﬀerent
from that intended by the user. The problem is due to the
poor usability oﬀered by current implementations of TLS [4]
which does not facilitate cognition of identities.
Data origin authentication, according to the X.800 stan-
dard, is ”the corroboration that the source of data received is
as claimed”. Malware infection of client platforms opens up
for attacks against data authentication that entity authenti-
cation cannot prevent. A typical example is online banking
transactions with mutual entity authentication. Even when
there is strong 2-factor user authentication, there is the pos-
sibility that a Trojan program changes the transaction de-
tails without the user’s knowledge (commonly known as a
”web inject” that can change the behaviour of the browser
and modify input and output data arbitrarily). SpyEye,
Zeus, IceIX, TDL, Hiloti, Carberp, are concrete examples of
malware that enable such attacks. In this case the human
user is assumed to be the origin, but the client modiﬁes
data input by the user before it is sent to the server sys-
tem, thus breaching data origin authentication. For typical
online transactions current solutions for user data origin au-
thentication are either non-existent or inadequate because
they assume the client system to be the origin of data.
The diﬀerence between entity authentication and data
authentication makes it necessary to have speciﬁc security
mechanisms to ensure data integrity in online transactions.
The OﬀPAD enables data origin authentication with high
assurance and usability, as explained below.
Related works are discussed in the journal paper [5] and
the technical report [7] accompanying this abstract. Several
authentication solutions that rely on an external device are
present in the literature, including Pico by Stajano, MP-
Auth by Mannan and van Oorschot, and Nebuchadnezzar
by Singer and Laurie. However, these devices only support
authentication of client-side entities to server-side parties,
i.e. typically user authentication, in contrast to the OﬀPAD
which also supports the authentication of server-side entities
to client-side parties, as well as data authentication.
2. OFFPAD DEVICE DESCRIPTION
The OﬀPAD is a trusted device, i.e. assumed to function
as intended and to be adequately protected against relevant
attacks. The ﬁrst OﬀPAD prototype is a phone cover con-
nected to its host with a standard micro-USB interface. This
makes the OﬀPAD a portable object, but not a second elec-
tronic object in the user’s pocket. Unlocking the OﬀPAD is
currently done through ﬁngerprint biometrics.
OﬀPAD is considered oﬄine, meaning that communica-
tions follow controlled formats, during short and restricted
time periods, not involving wireless broadband capabilities,
i.e., we use only micro-USB or NFC communications.
2Public-Key Infrastructure based on X.509 certiﬁcates
Being oﬄine eliminates exposure to Internet threats. Thus
we assume that attackers are unable to exploit bugs in Oﬀ-
PAD’s operating system and applications.
