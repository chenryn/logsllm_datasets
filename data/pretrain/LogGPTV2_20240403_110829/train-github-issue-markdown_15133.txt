### Issue: Changing Foreground Color for Selections in Atom Dark UI

**Reference:** [atom/atom-dark-ui#19](https://github.com/atom/atom-dark-ui/issues/19)

---

Currently, it is straightforward to modify the background color of selections using the following CSS:

```css
.selection .region {
  background-color: @red;
}
```

However, changing the foreground (text) color within a selection appears to be unfeasible. This limitation arises because the `selection` container simply overlays the text, without altering the `.line` element that contains the actual text.

For a visual reference, please see the attached screenshot:
