When I execute `next(ByteIter, '') << 8` in Python, I encounter a `NameError` stating:

```
global name 'next' is not defined
```

I suspect this error is due to the version of Python I am using, which is 2.5. In Python 2.6, you can call `ByteIter.next()`, but this method has been renamed to `next(ByteIter)` in Python 3. However, using `ByteIter.next()` is not recommended because it is not compatible with Python 3.

To make your code more compatible and future-proof, you should use the `next()` function with the iterator as an argument, like this:

```python
next(ByteIter, '') << 8
```

If you are using Python 2.5, you will need to upgrade to at least Python 2.6 or higher to use the `next()` function. Alternatively, you can use the `iter` and `next` methods directly on the iterator object, like this:

```python
ByteIter.next() << 8
```

However, for better compatibility with both Python 2 and 3, consider using the `next()` function with the iterator.
