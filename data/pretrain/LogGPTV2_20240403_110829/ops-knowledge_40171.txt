User: When I do next(ByteIter, '')<<8 in python, I got a name error saying

"global name 'next' is not defined"

I'm guessing this function is not recognized because of python version?  My version is 2.5.
Assistant: though you could call ByteIter.next() in 2.6. This is not recommended however, as the method has been renamed in python 3 to next().
