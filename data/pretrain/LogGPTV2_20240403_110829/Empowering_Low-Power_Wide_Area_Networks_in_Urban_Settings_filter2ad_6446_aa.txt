ABSTRACT
Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-WANs) are an attractive
emerging platform to connect the Internet-of-things. LP-WANs
enable low-cost devices with a 10-year battery to communicate
at few kbps to a base station, kilometers away. But deploying LP-
WANs in large urban environments is challenging, given the sheer
density of nodes that causes interference, coupled with attenuation
from buildings that limits signal range. Yet, state-of-the-art tech-
niques to address these limitations demand inordinate hardware
complexity at the base stations or clients, increasing their size and
cost.
This paper presents Choir, a system that overcomes challenges
pertaining to density and range of urban LP-WANs despite the lim-
ited capabilities of base station and client hardware. First, Choir pro-
poses a novel technique that aims to disentangle and decode large
numbers of interfering transmissions at a simple, single-antenna
LP-WAN base station. It does so, perhaps counter-intuitively, by
taking the hardware imperfections of low-cost LP-WAN clients
to its advantage. Second, Choir exploits the correlation of sensed
data collected by LP-WAN nodes to collaboratively reach a far-
away base station, even if individual clients are beyond its range.
We implement and evaluate Choir on USRP N210 base stations
serving a 10 square kilometer area surrounding Carnegie Mellon
University campus. Our results reveal that Choir improves network
throughput of commodity LP-WAN clients by 6.84 × and expands
communication range by 2.65 ×.

1 INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LP-
WANs) emerge as an attractive communication platform for the
Internet of Things (IoT) [37]. LP-WANs enable low-power devices
(milliwatts) to transmit at low data rates (kilobits per second) over
long distances (several kilometers). LP-WANs are an ideal vehicle
for cheap, low-power IoT devices such as sensors that have limited
power budget (e.g. a ten-year lithium ion battery) but also send
few kilobits per second of sensed data to the cloud. Consider future
smart cities where a few LP-WAN towers gather sensor data from
a large number of low-power devices in the city. Such devices can
exploit this reliable infrastructure to communicate, no matter where
they are placed, without ever being charged during their lifetimes.
Several LP-WAN proposals have emerged in the past few years,
including commercial technology for the unlicensed 900 MHz band
(LoRaWAN [28], SigFox [31]) as well as open standards for reusing
cellular infrastructure (LTE-M [25], NB-IoT [34]).
Yet, deploying city-scale LP-WAN networks is challenging for
two reasons: the density of deployment and the nature of urban
environments. First, the sheer density of deployment of LP-WAN
nodes means that transmissions from a large number of radios will
often collide. Such collisions adversely impact LP-WANs, drain-
ing battery life and wasting precious air time and spectrum in a
dense network. Second, deployments in urban areas cause the al-
ready weak signals of low-power nodes to be further attenuated by
buildings and other obstacles before reaching the base station. This
greatly reduces the range of LP-WAN sensors from over 10 km in
rural areas to 1-2 km or less in urban settings [2, 4, 41].
At the root of these challenges is the limited capability of LP-
WAN hardware, both at the base station and clients. On one hand,
the limited power budget and low cost of LP-WAN clients make it
challenging to deploy sophisticated MAC and PHY-layer schemes to
avoid collisions [12, 13]. On the other hand, LP-WAN base stations
struggle to resolve a large number of such collisions. Indeed, state-
of-the-art techniques such as uplink MU-MIMO [6, 26, 40] can
at best separate as many sensor nodes as there are base station
antennas (atmost 3-4 today due to limits on the size and cost [16, 27,
39]). As a result, there remains a fundamental disconnect between
the vision of dense, city-wide LP-WANs and the capabilities of
state-of-the-art LP-WAN hardware.
This paper aims to bridge this disconnect – it builds Choir, a
solution to overcome the challenges of dense, city-scale LP-WANs

despite the limited capability of client sensor nodes and base sta-
tions. First, we resolve collided transmissions from dense deploy-
ments of LP-WAN clients at an LP-WAN base station, even if it
is not MIMO-capable. We demonstrate how Choir improves the
throughput, latency and battery life of LP-WAN nodes. Second,
Choir improves the range of teams of low-power LP-WAN sensors
in urban environments. We demonstrate how teams of co-located
sensors can communicate together with an LP-WAN base station,
even if they are individually beyond its reception range. Choir
is fully implemented at the LP-WAN base station without requir-
ing hardware modifications to LP-WAN sensors. We integrate and
evaluate Choir with low-power embedded sensing hardware and
demonstrate end-to-end performance in a large neighborhood sur-
rounding Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) campus.
At the heart of our approach to disentangle collisions at the
base station is a strategy that exploits hardware imperfections of
low-cost components in LP-WAN radios. Specifically, the signals
transmitted by such hardware produces offsets in time, frequency,
and phase. Choir proposes algorithms that use these offsets to sepa-
rate and decode collisions from users. It achieves this by leveraging
properties of the physical layer of LoRaWAN LP-WAN radios that
transmits signals in the form of chirps, i.e., signals whose frequency
varies linearly in time. We show how hardware offsets, whether in
time, frequency or phase manifest as distinct aggregate frequency
shifts in chirps from each transmitter. We then filter the received
signal using these shifts to separate signals from different transmit-
ters. Choir then overcomes multiple challenges to decode useful
data packets from each filtered signal component. First, it develops
novel algorithms to separate bits of data from hardware offsets, both
of which are embedded in frequency shifts of chirps. Second, it uses
the precise values of the offsets of the separated signals to identify
which bits of decoded data belongs to which client to reconstruct
the packet over time. Given that Choir disentangles sensors in the
time and frequency domain as opposed to the antenna domain (i.e.,
MIMO), it can be implemented on a single-antenna base station. As
a result, Choir directly improves the throughput of dense urban
LP-WANs by decoding transmissions from multiple nodes simulta-
neously with minimal coordination overhead. It further enhances
both latency and battery life of LP-WAN clients by removing the
need for retransmissions.
Beyond dealing with density, we show how hardware offsets
between transmissions can boost the range of LP-WANs. Specifi-
cally, we consider transmissions from teams of LP-WAN sensors
that are individually beyond the range of the base stations, but
are physically co-located. Such sensors are likely to record similar
readings resulting in overlapping values for the most-significant
bits of sensed data. Choir devises a mechanism for such overlap-
ping most-significant bits to be recovered to help obtain a coarse
view of sensed data in a given area. We propose a simple modifi-
cation of the LP-WAN PHY that allows overlapping chunks of bits
collected by sensor nodes to be transmitted concurrently as overlap-
ping chunks of signals that are received at higher aggregate power.
Choir develops a novel algorithm to achieve this in software with-
out requiring expensive hardware modifications at the LP-WAN
clients to tightly synchronize their transmissions. We generalize
our approach to build a system that provides a coarse-grained view
of sensors further away, while improving throughput and providing

a fine-grained view of sensors near the base station. We further
discuss how the concepts in this paper apply to emerging and future
LP-WAN standards such as NB-IoT [34] and SIGFOX [31].
We implement Choir on a testbed of LoRaWAN LP-WAN radios.
We deploy LP-WAN base stations (see Fig. 1) on the top floors
of buildings covering a large area spanning 10 square kilometers
around CMU campus. We emulate LP-WAN base stations using
USRP N210 software radios. Our commodity LP-WAN client devices
transmit measured temperature and humidity data, and are spread
across CMU campus. We compare our system with a baseline that
employs uplink MU-MIMO [38] as well as different modes of the
standard LoRaWAN PHY and MAC [28]. Our results reveal the
following:
• Density: For 30 nodes placed over 100 randomly chosen
locations, with as many as 10 nodes transmitting data at any
given time, Choir achieves a throughput gain of 6.84 × over
standard LoRaWAN. It further achieves a 4.88 × reduction
in latency and 4.54 × reduction in number of transmissions
per decoded data packet.
• Range: For a team of up to 30 Choir nodes integrated with
temperature sensors across four floors in a large building,
we retrieve sensor data from distances as much as 2.65 km
with loss of resolution of 13.2 %, despite the fact that each
sensor can be heard individually no further than 1 km away
(a gain of 2.65 ×).
Contributions: This paper presents Choir, a novel system that
exploits the natural hardware offsets of LP-WAN clients to both
disentangle and decode their collided transmissions using a single-
antenna LP-WAN base station. Choir allows teams of LP-WAN
sensor nodes transmitting correlated data to reach an LP-WAN base
station, despite being individually beyond communication range.
Our system is fully implemented and deployed on a large outdoor
testbed spanning 10 square kilometers.

Low-Power Wide-Area Networks: Private enterprises such as
LoRaWAN [28] and SigFox [37] have developed LP-WAN chips that
use extremely narrow bands of unlicensed spectrum for diverse set
of applications. 3GPP has also developed two LP-WAN standards
for cellular base stations, namely, LTE-M [25] and NB-IOT [34].
Common to all LP-WAN technologies is the limited power budget
and bandwidth, hardware simplicity and low cost of client nodes.

range of LP-WAN radios in urban environments [2, 8] as well as
collisions in large-scale settings [2, 9, 11, 24].
LoRaWAN in particular uses chirp spread spectrum (CSS) for
transmitting data due to its low power requirements, hardware sim-
plicity, and performance under multipath and narrowband interfer-
ence. However, we emphasize that LoRaWAN, like other CSS-based
technologies [14, 42, 46] in radar or 802.15.4a divides chirps in time
using TDMA, CSMA or Aloha and does not decode collisions [8],
unlike say CDMA1 [43]. This is because decoupling data from col-
lisions of chirps in the presence of frequency and timing offsets
is fundamentally challenging (we elaborate on these challenges
and our solutions to overcome them in Sec. 4). Indeed, there has
been much work on collision avoidance and MAC protocols [14, 46]
for CSS for precisely this reason. However, our approach aims to
directly leverage hardware offsets to decode CSS collided transmis-
sions, as well as extend communication range.
Decoding Collisions in Wireless Networks: There has been
much past work on decoding collisions in wireless networks, par-
ticularly for cellular networks [15, 47], RFIDs [44] and wireless
LANs [7, 18, 40]. Much of this work relies on using multiple an-
tennas on wireless nodes be it MU-MIMO on the downlink [6],
uplink [40] or fully distributed MIMO [33]. Unfortunately, the max-
imum gain of these systems is limited by the number of antennas
on the base station (at best 3-4 today due to limits on size and
cost [16, 27, 39]). However, our system is able to separate collisions
even with a single-antenna base station.
Our proposed research perhaps is most closely related to systems
that were designed to decouple collisions across time and frequency.
ZigZag [19] decodes multiple collisions by intelligently separating
them in time. It requires multiple collisions from the same end-user
devices to decode data, unlike our work which strives to separate
data from a single collision. Recent work has also proposed the use
of carrier frequency offset to count transmissions from active RFID
tags [1]. They require the frequency offsets to be much larger than
bandwidth to separate simultaneous transmissions from different
narrow-band users, which, while true for active RFIDs, does not
hold for LP-WAN radios [28]. In contrast to these systems, our
approach separates even a single collision of transmissions from
multiple nodes that overlap in both time and frequency. It achieves
this by exploiting both timing and frequency offsets between the
nodes as well as properties of the LP-WAN PHY-layer.
Wide-Area Wireless Sensor Networks: Several proposals have
been made for better MAC protocols to avoid collisions in sensor
networks, including improved TDMA based methods [22, 36] and
collision-recovery methods [19, 23, 45]. Such schemes utilize either
customized hardware [19, 23] or improved sensor coordination [36,
45] to recover from or avoid collisions.
Our work is also related to systems that exploit correlation of
sensor data to improve performance. Glossy [17] develops hardware
and software at sensors to improve time-synchronization and ex-
ploit constructive interference of sensed data from different 802.15.4
transmitters. Past research has also proposed modifications to the
PHY-layer protocols such as the use of compressed sensing [30]
to exploit correlation of sensor data and improve performance.
