User: Please provide a local Git warehouse construction plan, including version control process, file structure and code management strategy, etc.
Assistant: Steps to build a local Git warehouse: 1. Install Git: We can download Git from the official website and install it. After the installation is complete, enter "git version" on the command line to check whether Git is installed successfully. 2. Create a local warehouse: In a local directory, use the command "git init" to initialize the Git warehouse. At this time, a hidden directory named .git will be generated in the directory to store the version history and other elements required by Git data. 3. Add files to the warehouse: Use the command "git add" to add the files we want to manage to the local warehouse, such as "git add filename". 4. Submit the changes to the warehouse: Use the command "git commit -m "commit message"" to submit the changes to the warehouse. In this way, a local Git repository is created. Version control process: The key to the version control process lies in Git branch management, which mainly consists of the following three version control processes: 1. Version branch: When developing in the warehouse, we can create new branches based on the main branch to develop new functions. Branches are called "feature branches". 2. Version merge: After the development of the feature branch is completed, we need to merge it back into the main branch. This merges the changes made in the feature branch with the master branch and makes it available for further development, as well as in preparation for testing, deployment and maintenance. 3. Version release: Release refers to the release of official versions, and marking and putting these versions into the production environment to make them available to users. File structure: In Git, the file structure is usually composed of the following two core files: 1. README.md: This is a Markdown file that should contain a detailed description, scripts, and other information of your project. 2. .gitignore: This is a text file that contains a list of files or folders to be excluded from version control. Code management strategies: Knowing the following strategies can help you better manage your code: 1. Development branches: In general, we recommend creating new branches from the master branch for feature development and fixes. 2. Feature branch: For each feature to be added or changed, a new feature branch should be created. 3. Commit message: For each commit, a meaningful commit message should be included. This helps other developers track changes and determine whether changes should be merged back into the master branch. 4. Merge Requests: Before publishing, you can ask other developers to review your code changes for correctness on a special branch. The Merge Request feature makes code merging much more manageable. 5. Version number: Number each released version and the corresponding update records for version management. Hope the above information is helpful to you.
