agreement procedure to create a security context (i.e., NAS
security context) for encryption and integrity protection. Af-
ter the Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) procedure,
most messages between the UE and the MME are encrypted
and integrity protected with cryptographic primitives. On the
other hand, all initial procedures before establishing a security
context in the AKA procedure are not encrypted and integrity
protected by design. Those unprotected messages include pag-
ing, SIBs and several network layer initial messages speciﬁed
in the LTE standard [5].
3 Overshadowing LTE Broadcast Message
In this section, we present the attack model, followed by a de-
scription of the SigOver attack. The SigOver attack is demon-
strated by using an SDR that is widely used today (i.e., Uni-
versal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) [16]). Lastly, we
compare the SigOver attack with typical FBS attacks to show
the effectiveness of the former.
3.1 Attack Model
We assume an active adversary with minimum privilege. The
proposed attack model can be described as follows: (i) The
adversary does not know the LTE key of the victim UE. (ii)
The adversary is able to eavesdrop on the downlink broadcast
messages transmitted from the legitimate LTE cell to the
victim UE(s). However, as the victim key is unavailable, the
encrypted messages cannot be decrypted. Note that (ii) is
trivially achievable because messages are transmitted through
the open medium. Under the above assumptions, we show
that an active adversary can inject malicious messages into
the victim UE(s) by overwriting the legitimate messages. This
is achieved by carefully crafting a message that overlaps a
legitimate message with respect to time and frequency. In
Section 3.5, we discuss the fundamental differences between
the proposed attack model and typical FBS attacks [21, 22,
36, 37, 39].
3.2 SigOver Attack Overview
This section brieﬂy outlines the design of the SigOver attack.
As discussed in Section 2, the LTE downlink is scheduled in a
subframe granularity with a duration of 1ms. Each subframe
is encoded separately by the base station, and is therefore
decoded accordingly by the UE. Under this frame structure,
Figure 3 conceptually illustrates the SigOver attack, where
the attacker injects a crafted subframe (brown color) that
precisely overshadows the legitimate subframe (blue color).
Since the subframes are decoded independently from one an-
other, the legitimate (non-overshadowed) subframes are gen-
erally not affected. At the same time, the injected subframe is
crafted such that the UEs that have received and decoded the
subframe behave based on the included information, which
typically yields an abnormal or malicious behavior - an in-
tended behavior by the attacker. The inherent vulnerability of
LTE broadcast messages enables an attacker to launch vari-
ous types of attacks using legitimately-looking messages (i.e.,
insidiously).
In principle, the SigOver attack leverages the capture ef-
fect [51], wherein the stronger signal is decoded when multi-
ple simultaneous wireless signals (i.e., legitimate and crafted
subframes) collide in the air. This is true for signals with
a slight power difference of 3 dB [29]. Two technical chal-
lenges to launch the SigOver attack are (i) carefully craft-
ing the overshadowing message to be decoded by the victim
UEs (Section 3.3), and (ii) the stringent requirement of the
transmission timing and frequency for precise overshadowing
(Section 3.4).
3.3 Crafting a Malicious Subframe
Here we illustrate how to craft a subframe that can be suc-
cessfully decoded at the victim UE for a successful attack.
Communication conﬁguration matching. For the SigOver
attack, the attacker must ﬁrst identify the physical conﬁgu-
ration of the legitimate cell on which the victim UEs are
camping, to determine the structure of the attack subframe.
The necessary physical conﬁguration information for valid
subframe construction includes the PCI, channel bandwidth,
PHICH conﬁguration, and transmission scheme (or the num-
ber of antenna ports); all of which are available to the attacker
once the attacker camps on the same legitimate cell. In partic-
ular, PCI is calculated from the PSS/SSS, and the remaining
information is obtained from the MIB. Furthermore, the at-
tacker must synchronize with the SFN of the legitimate cell,
which is also available in the MIB, to determine the injection
time of the attack subframe.
Subframe structuring and injection. In LTE, when a UE
reads a broadcast message, it decodes the following informa-
tion from a subframe: i) a Control Format Indicator (CFI) that
contains the control channel structure, ii) Downlink Control
Information (DCI) that contains the allocated resource (i.e.,
resource blocks) for the message, and iii) the resource blocks
(RBs) that contain the message itself. The CFI and DCI are

transmitted over the PCFICH and PDCCH respectively; and
the message is transmitted over the PDSCH. Therefore, to
inject a subframe, the attacker needs to craft a subframe that
contains the PCFICH, PDSCH and PDSCH. However, the
injected subframe containing those values may not be de-
coded correctly at the UE due to a channel estimation error.
Note that the UE estimates the channel from the RS transmit-
ted by the legitimate eNB, yet the estimation result may be
inappropriate to decode the injected subframe correctly. To
address this issue, the RS is included in the subframe for the
SigOver attack, which signiﬁcantly increases the robustness
of the SigOver attack.
The last technical challenge related to the decoding of the
crafted subframe is with respect to wireless channel estima-
tion and equalization, for recovery from the signal distortion
due to the channel. In the SigOver attack, the channel is esti-
mated either dominantly (even solely depending on the paging
occasion) from the crafted subframe (RRC Idle), or it is av-
eraged from consecutive subframes (RRC Connected) along
with multiple legitimate subframes. In the former, a single in-
jection is sufﬁcient for the attack (i.e., decoding of the crafted
subframe). In the latter, repeated injections are needed to ef-
fectively reﬂect the wireless channel between the attacker and
the victim UE. According to our measurement (Section 4)
which injected one subframe for every SFN, SigOver attack
reaches over 98% success rate in less than a second while
maintaining reliable communication for legitimate subframes.
In Appendix A, we present empirical results showing that
legitimate communication is minimally affected by SigOver
attack using several services including web browsing and
streaming.
3.4 Accurate Overshadowing
Overshadowing requires the crafted subframe to overlap the
legitimate signal precisely in both the time and frequency
domains. This subsection discusses how this is achieved.
Time synchronization. To precisely overshadow legitimate
subframes, an attacker needs to know the subframe timing
(to determine when a subframe starts) and SFN (to determine
when to inject the subframe with respect to the frame number)
from the legitimate cell. The attacker obtains the subframe
timing from the synchronization signals (i.e., PSS/SSS) and
the SFN from the MIB of the legitimate cell. The attacker

cording to the location of the victim UE and the attacker. The attacker
and victim UE are assumed to be within a cell coverage (the green
sector form)
continuously obtains the subframe timing and the updated
SFN, as the values vary over time depending on the channel
condition. With the knowledge of the subframe timing and
the SFN, the SigOver attack precisely synchronizes the trans-
mission time of the crafted subframe with that of the target
broadcast message (see Figure 4).
As shown in Figure 5, however, the crafted subframe trans-
mitted at the acquired subframe timing may still arrive at the
UE with a slight timing offset (with reference to the legitimate
subframe) due to the propagation delay. Although the delay
(d) is unavoidable (as the propagation delay is immeasurable
by the attacker), its impact is minimal. This is because the
baseband processor in the UE is designed to compensate the
delay due to mobility and environmental effects [48]. Since
the maximum delay that can be compensated is dependent on
the baseband processor of the UE, we perform the following
experiments to measure the delay. We assumed the typical
three-sector cell conﬁguration wherein the transmission angle
of the cell is 120◦ [10]. The delay (d) is maximized when the
attacker and the victim UE are located at both ends of the arc.
This translates to d = 8.66μs under a typical cell radius of
approximately 1.5km in urban environments. We measured
the offset tolerance on two devices with different basebands
(Qualcomm and Exynos), and the tolerance was larger than
the maximum delay (i.e., 8.66μs) (see Section 4 for detailed
experimental results).
Frequency synchronization. The operating frequency of a
radio device is determined by the oscillator, where it inevitably
suffers from a device-speciﬁc offset that is randomly imposed
during manufacturing and generated during operation due to
environmental effects (e.g., temperature). Such an imperfec-
tion in the oscillator is reﬂected in the radio signal as carrier
frequency offset. In LTE, there are a number of readily avail-
able techniques [27, 50] to compensate for offsets up to a
certain level (e.g., Up to ±7.5KHz for PSS based compensa-
tion in the LTE 15KHz subcarrier spacing [38]). Therefore,
for the reliable implementation of the SigOver attack, the off-
set should be maintained below that level in the UE, at all
times.

To satisfy the requirement, eNBs are equipped with highly
accurate oscillators and further augmentation techniques such
as a precision time protocol and GPS. In contrast, the SigOver
attack was run on a typical, inexpensive SDR with an inaccu-
rate oscillator (±2500 ppb for the USRP X310 [16]). A GPS
disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) was employed, namely, an
oven-controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) to reduce the fre-
quency offset to an appropriate level. The GPSDO provides a
sufﬁcient accuracy of ±25 ppb [14, 32] and is highly stable
(±1 ppb when the GPS locked). This indicates a frequency
offset of up to ±270Hz (at 3.6GHz with an offset of 75 ppb),
within the LTE FDD frequency range of 460MHz-3.6GHz [6].
Our experiment conﬁrms that all 10 devices (listed in Sec-
tion 5) can compensate such small frequency offset to enable
a reliable SigOver attack.
3.5 Comparison of SigOver, FBS and MitM
Attacks
Although the FBS and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks
can be used for broadcast message manipulation in LTE, only
the former has appeared in the literature. In this section, we
extensively analyze the FBS and MitM attacks in comparison
with the SigOver attack with respect to stealthiness, power
efﬁciency, and sustainability (see Table 1).
3.5.1 Attacks using FBS
The FBS attack is one of the most commonly used attacks
against cellular networks [21, 22, 26, 36, 39, 40]. In an FBS
attack, the attacker (i.e., the FBS) attracts victim UEs to camp
on itself by transmitting a stronger signal than legitimate cells.
The attacker then injects unprotected yet legitimate-looking
messages to the victim UE. The FBS attack has the following
limitations when compared with the SigOver attack.
Power Efﬁciency. In general, a UE selects the cell that trans-
mits signals with the highest power. However, it has not been
well investigated how much stronger signal the FBS should
transmit than a legitimate base station to attract nearby victim
UEs. This is an important question to be answered for the
attacker, as higher power increases the chance of attracting the
UE at a greater risk of being detected through power measure-
ments (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ). According to the experimental
measurements, the FBS attack reaches 100% success at 40 dB,
whereas the SigOver attack was 98% successful at 3 dB (see
Table 2). In particular, the FBS requires a power consumption
greater than that of the SigOver attack by a factor of 5000, to
achieve a comparable attack success rate.

Stealthiness. In general, an FBS is conﬁgured to masquer-
ade as a legitimate base station as presented in previous
studies [21, 22, 39, 40]. For example, the FBS broadcasts
the same MIB and SIB1/2 messages as those of the legiti-
mate cell and may use the same PCI to make itself indistin-
guishable from the legitimate ones. Nevertheless, the FBS
inevitably carries several unique and clear signatures for de-
tection [25, 30, 33, 49, 53]. First, as discussed earlier, an FBS
attack uses ×10,000 stronger power (cf. ×2 for SigOver at-
tack) than a legitimate cell, which is a clear indicator of the
FBS. Second, when an FBS attracts a victim UE camping on
a legitimate cell, the victim must undergo a cell re-selection
process, where the victim UE reads the MIB and SIB1/2 mes-
sages from the FBS (Figure 6a). Third, the operation of the
FBS may be very different from the legitimate ones due to
its limited physical capabilities compared to the real base
station3. Such operational characteristics include a relatively
low paging rate, in addition to different RF properties such as
a large frequency offset due to the low cost hardware. Finally,
the FBS cannot establish a secure connection with the UE or
transport protected NAS messages between the UE and the
network (i.e., MME), which results in a denial of service to
the UE. Hence, it is highly probable that a UE is able to detect
an FBS. On the other hand, the mechanism of the SigOver
attack is to precisely overshadow a speciﬁc broadcast message
without interfering the synchronization between the victim
UE and current cell. Therefore, as shown in Figure 6b, the
UE does not carry out cell re-selection or reconﬁgure any cell-
speciﬁc parameters. The UE subject to the SigOver attack
maintains secure signaling connections with the legitimate
eNB and MME.
Sustainability. If a victim UE camps on an FBS, it cannot
receive the service via the FBS. This can be used by the UE
as a potential FBS detection mechanism as mentioned above.
To avoid such detection, the FBS may take the following
strategy: it injects a malicious message to the UE, and releases
a connection (e.g., by causing a radio link failure or triggering
cell re-selection at the UE) so that the victim UE returns to
a legitimate cell. Under this scenario, however, the injected
3A state-sponsored attack with unlimited resource and capabilities was
not considered.

if the UE makes a cell change (e.g., TAU Reject [39]) or has
an immediate impact on the UE (e.g., emergency warning
message [21]). Thus, it is not an appropriate attack vector
