5.1.2 Prevalence of SA Preﬁxes
Here, we present experimental results of inferring export
preﬁxes to provider using the algorithm. We ﬁrst use dataset
described in Section 3 to construct the annotated AS graph
which is used to ﬁnd all direct or indirect customers of a
given provider. We then use the routes from Oregon or
ASs’ BGP tables to derive the best routes to customers’
preﬁxes. SA preﬁxes for 10 Tier-1 ASs can be inferred by
using Oregon RouteView and 3 Tier-1 ASs’ BGP tables.
Table 5 shows the percentage of customers’ preﬁxes that
are SA preﬁxes for 16 ASs. We ﬁnd that Tier-1 ASs, such as
AS1, AS3549, and AS7018, have a signiﬁcant number of SA
preﬁxes. Those Tier-1 ASs reach their (direct or indirect)
customers via their peers instead of customers. For example,
in Fig. 5, AS6280 is a customer of AS1. However, AS1 does
not receive a preﬁx p originated by AS6280 from AS852. It
receives p from its peer, AS3549. Note that SA preﬁxes for a
provider may be due to the selective announcement policies
of originating ASs or intermediate ASs. For example, in
Fig. 5, the SA preﬁx for AS1 may be due to the selective
announcement policies employed by AS6280 or AS852.
Next, we examine SA preﬁxes from the viewpoint of a set
of customers. We consider those customers which all have
3 direct or indirect providers: AS1, AS3549, and AS7018.
From those customers, we select 8 ASs which originate a
signiﬁcant number of preﬁxes as shown in Table 6. Ta-
ble 6 shows that those 3 providers cannot access some of
customers’ preﬁxes directly via their customer paths.
Applying the selective announcement policies, a customer
can balance its inbound traﬃc but its inbound and out-
bound traﬃc might be asymmetric. From the point of view
of a provider, it may ﬁnd that traﬃc between its customers
has to forward to the rest of Internet via its peer links.

5.1.3 Veriﬁcation of SA Preﬁxes
Because SA preﬁxes depend on AS relationships, the goal
of our veriﬁcation is to conﬁrm the validity of all AS re-
lationships which are used to infer SA preﬁxes. When we
infer customers’ export policies, or selective announcement
policy, using the algorithm described before, we ﬁrst inves-
tigate if the AS which originates the SA preﬁx is a customer
of a given provider, and then the AS relationship between
the provider and the next hop AS of the best route to the
preﬁx is examined. We verify SA preﬁxes by following steps:
Step 1: Verify AS relationships between a given
provider and its neighboring ASs. As described in Sec-
tion 4.3 , the AS relationships between 9 ASs in Table 4 and
their neighboring ASs are veriﬁed by using BGP community
as shown in the Appendix. Such small error in inferring AS

relationships can be neglected. In our veriﬁcation, we focus
on 3 Tier-1 ASs, AS1, AS3549, and AS7018, since a large
number of SA preﬁxes are observed from those 3 ASs. The
result from Table 4 also implies that the peer relationship
between those 3 providers and their next hop ASs in the
best route is veriﬁed.
Step 2: Verify the customer relationship between
an AS which originates a SA preﬁx and a given
provider. Because an AS can be a direct or indirect cus-
tomer of a provider, we ﬁrst verify the direct customers. We
can verify direct customers since we already verify AS rela-
tionships between those 3 providers and their neighboring
ASs. For indirect customer, we need to verify all AS re-
lationships between each pair of ASs in the customer path
which is used in the algorithm described in Fig. 4 to infer a
SA preﬁx. Our method is to investigate the existence of the
customer path in the Internet. Even though the customer
path is derived from our algorithm, it is possible that some
other preﬁxes are really announced through it. We call a cus-
tomer path active if other preﬁxes traverse the same path.
By searching all paths in BGP routing tables, we determine
whether a customer path for a SA preﬁx is active. Given
a customer path, for example, AS1 AS12 AS14 AS15, if the
customer relationship between AS1 and AS12 is veriﬁed at the
ﬁrst step, and the path is active, the relationships between
AS12 and AS14, AS14 and AS15, can be veriﬁed as provider-
to-customer. Otherwise, if AS12 is a peer, or a provider of
AS14, AS12 cannot announce path AS12 AS14 to its provider
AS1 according to the export rule described in Section 2.2.
We verify all SA preﬁxes for AS1, AS3549, and AS7108
according to the steps described above. Table 7 shows that
most of SA preﬁxes for those 3 ASs are veriﬁed.
Besides verifying AS relationships, for each AS, if its im-
port policies are already inferred, we only consider those
preﬁxes that have typical local preference. That is, pre-
ﬁxes from peers have lower local preference than those from
customers, or preﬁxes from providers have lower local pref-
erence than those from peers. We note that the percentage
of anomaly local preference is small in Table 2, and will not
aﬀect our results.
5.1.4 Persistence of SA Preﬁxes
Having identiﬁed the prevalence of SA preﬁxes, we now
turn our attention to SA preﬁx persistence. Network opera-
tors may change preﬁx exporting pattern at diﬀerent time.
To ﬁnd out how persistent SA preﬁxes are over a period of
Table 7: Large number of SA preﬁxes for AS1,

measurement time, BGP tables for March 2002 from Ore-
gon RouteView are used. We are also interested in how SA
preﬁxes change within one day, so we use data from Oregon
RouteView on March 15, 2002. Here, we only present the
result of AS1 because it has a large number of SA preﬁxes.
Fig. 6(a) shows the number of SA preﬁxes during March,
2002. Fig. 6(b) shows the number of SA preﬁxes on that
day (March 15, 2002). From Fig. 6, we ﬁnd that SA preﬁxes
are consistently present in AS1.
As we mentioned above, network operators might change
their routing policies to control incoming traﬃc. To ﬁnd out
how export policies aﬀect the existence of SA preﬁxes, we
deﬁne the times each preﬁx appears during the measuring
time as uptime. SA preﬁx uptime is deﬁned as the times a
SA preﬁx appears. The maximum uptime of a preﬁx during
our measurement is 31 days or 24 hours depending on which
view of the data we are examining. We study how many
preﬁxes shift from SA preﬁx to non-SA preﬁx during the
whole period. For example, some preﬁxes have 31 uptimes
but less than 31 SA preﬁx uptimes during the whole month.
Those preﬁxes shift from SA preﬁxes to non-SA preﬁxes.
From Fig. 7, we observe that about one sixth of SA preﬁxes
are not stable during one month, but most of them are stable
during one day period. Changes in routing policies can aﬀect
existence of SA preﬁxes.
5.1.5 Causes of SA Preﬁxes
A provider may have two diﬀerent connectivities to its cus-
tomers: a direct customer path, and a “curving” peer path.
This leads us to analyze two ways which customers use to
connect providers: multihomed and single-homed. Fig. 8(a)
shows that customer v is multihomed to two providers. Path
u0u2u1v is the best path, and path u0u3v is a customer path
from u0 to v. The best path and the customer path are
disjoint paths. Fig. 8(b) shows that customer v is single-
homed. Path u0u2u1v is the best path, and path u0u3u1v
is a customer path from u0 to v. They share some paths.
For AS1, AS3549, and AS7018, we examine the connec-
tivities between those 3 ASs and their customers. From Ta-
ble 8, we ﬁnd that among those customers whose announced
preﬁxes are SA preﬁxes, about 75% of them are multihomed,
and others are single-homed. In the multihomed case, ori-
gin ASs or intermediate ASs may apply selective announce-
ment policies to preﬁxes.
In the single-homed case, only
intermediate ASs which are multihomed can apply selective
announcement policies to their preﬁxes or their customers’
preﬁxes. Intuitively, it is more likely for multi-homed ASs
to generate SA preﬁxes than for single-homed ASs. This is
conﬁrmed in Table 8.
From the point of view of a provider, we deﬁne a preﬁx as
a SA preﬁx if the provider receives the preﬁx originated by
its customer from a peer instead of a customer. However,

homed ASs whose preﬁxes are SA preﬁxes for AS1,

other cases can cause the provider not to receive the preﬁx
from its customer path. Here, we study 3 cases which may
produce SA preﬁxes.
Case 1: Preﬁx splitting. Network operators can split
one preﬁx into some more speciﬁc preﬁxes [7]. For example,
a preﬁx “12.0.0.0/19” can be split into a more speciﬁc preﬁx
“12.10.1.0/24”. Then they announce the speciﬁc preﬁx to
a provider through a peer link, and announce the original
preﬁx to the provider through a customer path. They take
advantage of this approach to balance load and tolerate link
failures. If the customer path through which the more spe-
ciﬁc preﬁx is announced is broken, the preﬁx can be accessed
through the other path. This conﬁguration can produce SA
preﬁxes.
For all preﬁxes in AS1, AS3549, and AS7018, we analyze
the number of preﬁxes which are split preﬁxes. If we ﬁnd one
preﬁx that can be aggregated by another preﬁx, and both
preﬁxes belong to the same source AS but have diﬀerent
routes (i.e. one is a customer route, the other is a peer
route), those two preﬁxes are split. Comparing with the
number of SA preﬁxes, we ﬁnd that the number of preﬁxes
splitting, shown in Table 9, is so small that preﬁx splitting
is not the main cause of SA preﬁxes.
Case 2: Preﬁx aggregating. A provider can allo-
cate a part of its IP address space to its customers. When
the provider receives preﬁx announcements from customers,
those allocated preﬁxes can be aggregated by the provider
so that they will not be announced to other ASs. For ex-
ample, a customer is allocated with a preﬁx “12.10.1.0/20”
from its provider’s IP space “12.10.0.0/19”. Even though
the provider receives an announcement for “12.10.1.0/20”,
it announces “12.10.0.0/19” only. We call this preﬁx aggre-
gating. For all preﬁxes of AS1, AS3549, and AS7018, we
analyze the number of preﬁxes which are aggregated. For
simplicity, we estimate this case by ﬁnding how many SA
preﬁxes can be aggregated by other preﬁxes without consid-
ering if providers can aggregate those preﬁxes or not. Our
estimation can be regarded as upper bound of this case. Ta-
ble 9 shows the extent to which preﬁx aggregating exists in
