Question: Why might signature-based detection not be sufficient as the sole security measure for a critical financial transaction system?
"A": "The system processes a high volume of transactions, which might cause performance issues with signature-based detection.",
"B": "Signature-based detection can easily be evaded by attackers using polymorphic code that changes its appearance every time it runs.",
"C": "Financial systems only require encryption for security, making signature-based detection irrelevant.",
"D": "Signature-based detection systems are primarily used for detecting physical intrusions, not cyber threats."
Answer: B
