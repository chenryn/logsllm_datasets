User: How to do a search and replace on a file using the sed command?
Assistant: Use the sed command to perform search and replace operations. Its basic syntax is as follows: ``` sed 's/original string/new string/g' filename``` Among them: - `s` represents the replacement operation, followed by the original string and the new string. - Any delimiter can be used between the original string and the new string, usually `/`. - `g` means global matching, which can replace multiple matching items in a line. Here are some examples, assuming we have a file `text.txt` with the following content: ``` apple orange banana Hello World! 12345 ``` 1. Replace `apple` with `pear` ``` sed 's/ apple/pear/g' text.txt ``` Output: ``` pear orange banana Hello World! 12345 ``` 2. Replace `World` in the second line with `Universe` ``` sed '2s/World/ Universe/g' text.txt ``` Output: ``` apple orange banana Hello Universe! 12345 ``` 3. Replace both matches in a line ``` sed 's/e/E/g ;s/a/A/g' text.txt ``` Output: ``` Apple OrAngE bAnAnA HEllo World! 12345 ``` The above command first replaces all `e`s with `E`, and then replaces all `a` is replaced by `A`. Note that the two substitutions are separated by a semicolon `;`.
