User: I've been learning Python and now I'd like to learn a Python-based web framework.  I'm considering Google App Engine and Django.  Which one should I choose?  What are their unique features and learning curves?
Assistant: I believe that Django is better because it gives more flexibility with features and also with hosts. Djangobook.com has a very good tutorial.
