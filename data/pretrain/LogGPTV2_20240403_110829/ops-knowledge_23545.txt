User: Please explain what is containerization and container orchestration? What are the common containerization technologies?
Assistant: Containerization is the packaging of an application and all its dependencies into a self-contained container for deployment and operation in different environments. Containers can contain applications, libraries, runtime environments, system tools, and more. The advantages of rapid deployment, portability, resource isolation, and elastic scaling can be realized by using containerization technology. Container orchestration refers to the process of managing and coordinating multiple container instances. In containerized services, it is usually necessary to run multiple container instances to provide functions such as high availability and load balancing. Through container orchestration tools, multiple container instances can be automatically run, deployed, scaled, and monitored, thereby simplifying the management process and improving efficiency. Common containerization technologies include Docker, Kubernetes, Podman, LXC/LXD, CRI-O, OpenVZ, etc. Among them, Docker is one of the most popular containerization technologies, and Kubernetes is currently the most popular container orchestration tool.
