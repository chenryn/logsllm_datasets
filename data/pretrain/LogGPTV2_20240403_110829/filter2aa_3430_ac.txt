### Quantum Annealing and Optimization

#### Hamiltonian Construction
- The optimal solution to an optimization problem corresponds to the minimum energy state of the system.

#### Energy Landscape
- The space of energy states can be visualized as a landscape with mountains and valleys.
- The solution to the optimization problem corresponds to the lowest valley, but finding this lowest point is challenging.

#### Classical Solution
- In classical computing, the problem is solved by "climbing" higher energy solutions by increasing the energy (temperature) and then gradually cooling down the system to find the path to the minimum.
- This approach can easily get stuck in local minima, leading to suboptimal solutions.

#### Quantum Annealing (QA)
- In QA, we start with a ground state of a well-known physical system that is easy to prepare (ùêª‚ÇÄ).
- We then evolve the Hamiltonian of this system adiabatically (very slowly) until it transforms into the problem Hamiltonian (ùêª‚ÇÅ).

#### Adiabatic Evolution
- The Hamiltonian is defined as: 
  \[
  H = (1 - s)H_0 + sH_1
  \]
  - Initially, \( s = 0 \), so \( H = H_0 \).
  - We gradually increase \( s \) and compute the ground state of \( H \).
  - This process continues until \( s = 1 \), at which point \( H = H_1 \).
  - The adiabatic theorem guarantees that the ground state at the end of the computation is the optimal solution.

#### Formulating an Optimization Problem
- Fundamental research by Burges (2002) introduced the idea of factoring as an optimization problem.
- The goal is to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( N = pq \).
- This can be formulated as an optimization problem using binary representations of \( p \) and \( q \).

#### Binary Representation
- Let \( p = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{s_p} 2^i P_i \) and \( q = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{s_q} 2^i Q_i \), where \( P_i \) and \( Q_i \) are the i-th bits of \( p \) and \( q \).
- A cost function \( f(P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_{s_p}, Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_{s_q}) = (N - pq)^2 \) is defined.
- The task is to find \( P_i \) and \( Q_i \) such that \( f \) is minimized (ideally, \( f = 0 \)).

#### Example: Factoring \( N = 15 \)
- For \( N = 15 \):
  - \( p = 2x_1 + 1 \)
  - \( q = 4x_2 + 2x_3 + 1 \)
  - The cost function is:
    \[
    f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (15 - (2x_1 + 1)(4x_2 + 2x_3 + 1))^2
    \]
  - Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 128x_1x_2x_3 - 56x_1x_2 - 48x_1x_3 + 16x_2x_3 - 52x_1 - 52x_2 - 96x_3 + 196
    \]
  - The task is to find \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) such that \( f \) is minimal (ideally, \( f = 0 \)).

#### Running on D-Wave
- This problem can be run on D-Wave's Quantum Annealer using their open-source SDK (dwave-ocean-sdk).
- Factoring a 2‚Åø-bit integer requires O(n¬≤) qubits, making it impractical for large numbers.

#### Probabilistic Nature
- Quantum algorithms are inherently probabilistic. Multiple runs may be necessary to achieve the desired result.

#### Gr√∂bner Bases
- Gr√∂bner bases are used to reduce the degree of the Hamiltonian, significantly reducing the problem size.
- Dridi and Alghassi (2016) were able to factor all bi-primes up to 2 √ó 10‚Åµ using a D-Wave 2X Processor with 1,100 qubits.
- A 5,600-qubit system is expected to be available in 2020.

#### Breakthroughs
- Jiang et al. (2018) proposed a new map, raising the record for a quantum factorized integer to 376,289 with just 94 qubits.
- Peng et al. (2019) further optimized this, factoring 1,005,973 with 89 qubits.

#### Conclusion
- While Shor‚Äôs algorithm gets most of the attention, Quantum Annealing-based approaches are currently a thousand-fold better than Universal Quantum Computing (UQC) approaches.
- QC hardware and research have seen significant advancements, but QC systems are still too noisy to be a threat.
- Algorithms are being heavily optimized, and the number of qubits is increasing rapidly.
- Symmetric ciphers are only as secure as the currently known algorithms.
