• The space of energy states resembles a landscape of formed by mountains 
and valleys
• The solution corresponds to the lowest valley, but how do we find the lowest 
one?
• Classical Solution
– Tries to solve this problem by “climbing” the higher energy 
solutions by increasing the energy (temperature) and
letting the system cool down gradually to find the path 
to the minimum
– This solution can easily get stuck in a local minima.

• In QA, we start in a ground state of some well-known 
physical system which is easy to prepare (𝐻0).
• Then we evolve adiabatically (very slowly) the 
Hamiltonian of this system until it transforms 
into the problem Hamiltonian 𝐻1

• 𝐻 = (1 − 𝑠)𝐻0 + 𝑠𝐻1
– Initially we compute 𝑠 = 0, so 𝐻 = 𝐻0
• Then we increase s and compute again 
the ground state of 𝐻
• We repeat this process until s=1 and 
therefore 𝐻 = 𝐻1
• The adiabatic theorem guarantees that 
the ground state at the end of the 
computation is the optimal solution.

We need to formulate an optimization problem

• First fundamental research was from Burges, 2002, “Factoring as 
Optimization”, Microsoft Research, https://www.microsoft.com/en-
us/research/publication/factoring-as-optimization/
• The idea is simple: We are looking for 𝑝, 𝑞 so that 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞
• We “just” need to write this as an optimization problem

We need to formulate an optimization problem
52
• 𝑁 = 𝑝𝑞
• Binary representation 𝑝 = 1 + ෌𝑖=1..𝑠𝑝 2𝑖𝑃𝑖, 𝑞 = 1 + ෌𝑖=1..𝑠𝑞 2𝑖𝑄𝑖
– 𝑃𝑖, 𝑄𝑖 is the i-th bit for p,q, 
– remember that in binary all prime numbers begin and end with a 1
• We can define a cost function (to be minimized)
– 𝑓 𝑃1, 𝑃2, … , 𝑃𝑠𝑝, 𝑄1, 𝑄2, … , 𝑄𝑠𝑞
= 𝑁 − 𝑝𝑞 2
– If I find 𝑃𝑖, 𝑄𝑖 so that 𝑓 …
= 0, then N = 𝑝𝑞 and we are done ☺
– This is a QUBO, which we can run on a Quantum Annealer (D-Wave)

We need to formulate an optimization problem

• Example: 𝑁 = 15 = 5 × 3
– 𝑝 = 𝑥11 = 2𝑥1 + 1
– q = 𝑥2𝑥31 = 22𝑥2 + 2𝑥3 + 1
– 𝑓 𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3 = 𝑁 − 𝑝𝑞 2 = (15 − 2𝑥1 + 1
22𝑥2 + 2𝑥3 + 1 )2

96𝑥3 + 196
• Task: find 𝑥1, 𝑥21𝑥3 so that the positive 𝑓 𝑥1, 𝑥2, 𝑥3 is minimal (equal to 0)

• Binary multiplication shows (91 = 1011011)

Virtually all optimizations improve
the multiplication table somehow
e.g. rightmost bit means 𝑥3 not 𝑦3, 
so we can reduce this with

• So-called “Gröbner” bases are used to reduce the degree of the Hamiltonian
• This pre-processing significantly reduces the size of the problem
• Their algorithm can factor all bi-primes up to 2 × 105 using a D-Wave 2X 
Processor
– Main limitation is the number of qubits available
• Dwave 2X has 1,100 qubits, however 5,600 qubit system will be available in 2020
• They were able to factor 200,099 with 897 qubits 
Dridi, Alghassi refined this approach in 2016

• Three things were very interesting about their approach.
– They were able to run this on currently available hardware
• current quality of qubits is good enough to run this algorithm (unlike e.g. Shor’s algorithm). 
– To factor an RSA-768 number (current factorization record on classical 
computers), their algorithm would "only" need 147,454 qubits. 
• D-Wave have announced a quantum computer with 5,640 qubits already, so the more qubits 
there are, the more vulnerable RSA will become.
– Their algorithm uses a combination of quantum and classical computation to 
maximise the results. 
• interestingly that's the same for Shor's algorithm and a common approach. Use classical 
computers for what they are good at and quantum computers for what they are good at

• While Shor’s algorithm gets most of the PR attention, QAC is currently a 
thousand-fold better than UQC approaches
– Both from the hardware (D-Wave systems have much more qubits)
– As well from the research (massive optimizations in the last 3 years alone)
• QC’s are way too noisy to be a threat anytime soon, but
– QC’s are getting better and better
– Algorithms are being optimized heavily

• Myth: Shor is currently the best-known algorithm to factor integers
• Reality: QA based algorithms are outperforming Shor by a factor of a thousand
• Myth: Shor’s algorithm will eventually break cryptography
• Reality: Shor’s algorithm was never meant to be implemented. Derivations of it 
will be used to break cryptography
• Myth: Today we have X qubits, Shor’s algorithm needs Y qubits. Based on the last 
few years of qubit growth, it’ll take Z years to break cryptography
• Reality: It’ll be much quicker as you need to take the optimizations in the 
algorithms into account (e.g. from 1bn to 200m in just 7 years)

• Myth: No need to worry as QC-based approaches are at least 10 years away
• Reality: That may or may not help you
– Example: Satoshi’s BTC coins have well-known public key. If I have a QC in 10 years 
time, these coins are mine and there is nothing anyone can do about it
– We talk about over 1.1m BTC, which is currently around 12bn USD
• Myth: QC may well be 20 years away and not 10 years
• Reality: It all depends on breakthroughs in a) number of qubits, b) quality of 
qubits, c) quality of gate operation, d) optimizations in algorithms. 
– We’ve seen massive breakthroughs in all 4 areas over the last 6 years. It may be 
possible that we see none over the next 6 years, although I don’t think so.
