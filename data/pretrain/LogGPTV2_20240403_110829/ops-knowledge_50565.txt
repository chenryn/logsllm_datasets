User: The following little script is supposed to run a shell command with a parameter every 10 minutes. It's ran correctly once (30 minutes ago) however isn't playing ball now (should have done the process another 2 times since). Have I made an error?

while(True):
  subprocess.call(["command","param"])
  time.sleep(600)
Assistant: Try subprocess.Popen if you don't need to wait for the command to complete.
From the docs, 

subprocess.call: Run the command described by args. Wait for command to complete, then return the returncode attribute.
