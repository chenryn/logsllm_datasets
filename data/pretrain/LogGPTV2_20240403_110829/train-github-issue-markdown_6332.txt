See the following Plunker for repro: http://plnkr.co/edit/MrCUDP8qwGPj7ler4ySW
The code `[class.selected]="toggleSvc.isActive | async"` where
toggleSvc.isActive is a BehaviorSubject results in the following error
message:
> EXCEPTION: Expression 'toggleSvc.isActive | async in AppComponent@1:7' has
> changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'true'. Current value: 'true'
> in [toggleSvc.isActive | async in AppComponent@1:7]
I don't see how the value is changed after change detection - ng2 even says
that it stayed the same in this error message (true -> true).
Don't exactly know if this is related only to class property bindings or to
all kinds, because this is currently the main thing that I'm observing.
Replacing the line with `[class.selected]="toggleSvc._isActive"` makes it run
correctly.  
The binding in the content (`Active: {{toggleSvc.isActive | async}}`) works
without issues.
