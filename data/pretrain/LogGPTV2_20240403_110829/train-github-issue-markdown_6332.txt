Please refer to the following Plunker for a reproducible example: [http://plnkr.co/edit/MrCUDP8qwGPj7ler4ySW](http://plnkr.co/edit/MrCUDP8qwGPj7ler4ySW).

In the code snippet `[class.selected]="toggleSvc.isActive | async"`, `toggleSvc.isActive` is a `BehaviorSubject`. This results in the following error message:

> EXCEPTION: Expression 'toggleSvc.isActive | async in AppComponent@1:7' has changed after it was checked. Previous value: 'true'. Current value: 'true' in [toggleSvc.isActive | async in AppComponent@1:7].

I am unable to understand how the value is considered to have changed after change detection, as Angular's error message indicates that the value remained the same (true -> true). 

It is unclear whether this issue is specific to class property bindings or affects all types of bindings, as this is the primary problem I am currently observing.

Interestingly, replacing the line with `[class.selected]="toggleSvc._isActive"` resolves the issue and the application runs correctly. Additionally, the binding in the content (`Active: {{toggleSvc.isActive | async}}`) works without any issues.
