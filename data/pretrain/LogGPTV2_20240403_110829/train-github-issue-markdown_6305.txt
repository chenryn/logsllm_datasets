When concatenating empty list with a list of INTEGERS result is an array of
FLOATS. Since numpy 1.12 you can not use floats (result of such concatenation)
for indexing without additional convertion from float to integer.
Following example works in numpy = 1.12:
    array = np.arange(3)
    ind0 = []
    ind1 = [1]
    total_ind = np.concatenate([ind0, ind1])
    print array[total_ind]
