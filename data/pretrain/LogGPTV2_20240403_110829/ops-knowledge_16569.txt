User: I'm currently using a Jenkins build to run a bash command that activates a Python script. The build is parametrised, and i need to be able to set environment variables containing those parameters on the Windows slave to be used by the Python script.
So, my question is: How do i set temporary env. variables for the current build and secondly, how do i use Python to retreive them while running a script?
An explanation of the process would be great since i couldn't make any solution work.
Assistant: What I usually do is going on the build output, on the left you will find "Build environment Variables" or something similar and check if you can see them there, but the solution cited on the other SO post works usually for me as well
