I received the following warning when I clicked anywhere on the document:

```
"An empty string has been transmitted to « getElementById() ». @ jquery.min.js:4"
```

The only libraries I have loaded are jQuery 2.0.3 and Bootstrap 3.0.3.

Could you help me understand what might be causing this issue?
