sage is sent. Unfortunately, because legitimate users are unable to
determine whether or not their message has been accepted by the
system, the tradeoff for implementing this policy is a reduction in
the reliability of Internet-originated text messages.
Furthermore, all web interfaces should limit the number of re-
cipients to which a single SMS submission is sent. The ability to
send ten messages per submission at both the Verizon and Cingular
Wireless websites is particularly dangerous as ﬂooding the system
requires one-tenth of the messages and bandwidth necessary to in-
terfere with other networks.
Reducing the ability to automate submissions is another approach
that should be considered as a temporary solution for these inter-
faces. Having the sender’s computer calculate tractable but difﬁ-
cult puzzles [8, 62] before a submission is completed limits the
frequency with which any machine can inject messages into a sys-
tem. The use of CAPTCHAs [61, 43], or images containing embed-
ded text that is difﬁcult for computers to parse, is also plausible.
Because CAPTCHAs are not unbreakable [42] and puzzles only
impede the submission speed for individuals, both of these coun-
termeasures can be circumvented if an attacker employs a large
enough zombie network.
The last and certainly least popular suggestion is to close the
interface between the web and cellular networks. While this solu-
tion is the most complete, it is extremely unlikely to receive serious
consideration due to the potential ﬁnancial consequences it would
cause to both service providers and third-party companies provid-
ing goods and services through this interface. Given the size of
these networks and the number of connected external entities, im-
plementing this option may actually be impossible.
6.4 Education
While the above mechanisms are appropriate for the prevention
of DoS attacks, they have limited success preventing phishing scams.
Phishers will still be able to send messages to individuals through
the web interface with anonymity; however, their ability to blanket
large preﬁxes in a short period of time is greatly reduced. Unfortu-
nately, it may only require a single message for an attacker to get
the sensitive information they seek. Additionally, viruses will still
be able to damage mobile devices as their introduction to a speciﬁc
system is frequently the result of some user action.
The only practical solution for this family of exploits is there-
fore education. Cellular service providers must launch an aggres-
sive campaign to reach all of their clients to tell them that no such
request for information will ever come via SMS text. To this date,
we are unaware of any such effort.
7. RELATED WORK
Phone networks are among the oldest digital systems in the world.
In spite of their distributed nature, these networks have traditionally
enjoyed a relatively high level of security due to a logical and phys-
ical separation from external systems. As phone networks become
increasingly interconnected with networks such as the Internet, pre-
vious security assumptions no longer hold. Since the initial conver-
gence of these networks, a number of vulnerabilities have been dis-
covered. Before 2002 messages between SS7 network nodes were
transmitted in plaintext without authentication [52]. Additionally,
the parsers for call routing information, which use the ASN.1 lan-
guage, were demonstrated to be vulnerable to buffer overﬂow at-
tacks. Despite current efforts of securing mechanisms critical to
network operation [36, 41], little attention has been paid to directly
securing end users against the consequences of connecting phone
networks to the Internet.
Attaching systems to the Internet has been problematic in other
contexts as well. By leveraging the combination of automation and
anonymity in the digital domain, an adversary can negatively af-
fect systems in the physical world. Byers, et al. [15] demonstrated
the ability to use simple automated scripting tools to register an in-
dividual for large volumes of postal junk mail. The speed of this
attack far outpaces the ability of the targeted individual to remove
him or herself from the mailing lists, thereby destroying all practi-
cal usability of one’s physical mailbox.
A large number of websites have fallen victim to DoS attacks [1].
Access to Yahoo!, Amazon, and eBay were all temporarily restricted
when their servers were ﬂooded with over a gigabit per second of
trafﬁc in 2002 [21]. Signiﬁcant research has been dedicated to ex-
ploring and defending against these attacks on the Internet [31, 51,
39, 62]. The inability to differentiate the origin of SMS messages
after arrival at end devices makes techniques used to trace and mit-
igate [50, 33] these attacks ineffective. While attacks have been
mounted against speciﬁc phones [49], the feasibility of a widespread
a DoS and the effectiveness of traditional DoS countermeasures on
a phone network have not been explored.
In an attempt to understand the parameters leading to non-mali-
cious, congestion-based DoS scenarios in a wireless environment,
the National Communications System published a study examining
the effects of SMS messages [44]. This study primarily focused
upon problems caused by mobile to mobile communications and
the lack of privacy users relying on email for SMS delivery should
expect. While the lack of capacity available in critical scenarios
was well highlighted, little focus was given to the impact of an
intentionally malicious intruder, especially one originating in the
Internet.
8. CONCLUSION
Cellular networks are a critical part of the economic and social
infrastructures in which we live. These systems have traditionally
experienced below 300 seconds of communication outages per year
(i.e., “ﬁve nines” availability). However, the proliferation of exter-
nal services on these networks introduces signiﬁcant potential for
misuse. We have shown that an adversary injecting text messages
from the Internet can cause almost twice the yearly expected net-
work down-time in a metropolitan area using hit-lists containing
as few as 2500 targets. With additional resources, cyberwarfare
attacks capable of denying voice and SMS service to an entire con-
tinent are also feasible. By attacking the less protected edge com-
ponents of the network, we elicit the same effects as would be seen
from a successful assault on the well protected network core.
Mobile voice and text messaging have become indispensable
tools in the lives of billions of people across the globe. The prob-
lems presented in this paper must therefore be addressed in order
to preserve the usability of these critical services.
