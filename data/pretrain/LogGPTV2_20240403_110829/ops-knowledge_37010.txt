User: Please explain what is load balancing? List several load balancing algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages.
Assistant: Load balancing is a technology that distributes access requests to multiple servers in order to achieve optimal utilization of resources, improve system reliability, enhance system scalability, and facilitate management. The following are several common load balancing algorithms and their advantages and disadvantages: 1. Round Robin Round Robin is a relatively simple load balancing algorithm that distributes requests to backend servers in sequence. Its advantage is that it is easy to implement and manage, but when the performance of the back-end server is unbalanced, it is easy to cause uneven distribution of requests on the server. 2. The least connection algorithm (Least Connection) The least connection algorithm is based on the back-end server with the least number of current connections. Its advantage is that it can dynamically adjust the allocation of requests according to the load of the server. But its disadvantage is that for long-term connection requests, connection resources cannot be released in time, which may cause some servers to be overloaded. 3. IP hash algorithm (IP Hash) IP hash algorithm is based on the IP address requested by the client to perform hash calculation on the back-end server and assign the request to the corresponding server. Its advantage is that it has good stability, and requests from the same client will be assigned to the same server, reducing the number of forwarding requests. But its disadvantage is that when the number of servers changes, it may cause uneven distribution of requests. 4. Weighted Round Robin (Weighted Round Robin) Weighted Round Robin is a round-robin allocation request based on the weight value of the back-end server. Its advantage is that different server weight values can be set according to the actual situation to achieve the optimization effect of load balancing. But its disadvantage is that the configuration is more complicated, and the weight value needs to be dynamically adjusted according to the performance of the server. 5. Weighted Least Connection algorithm (Weighted Least Connection) The weighted least connection algorithm is calculated according to the weight value of the server and the number of connections, and assigns the request to the back-end server with the least number of current connections and high weight. Its advantage is that it can dynamically adjust the distribution of requests according to the server performance and the number of connections at the same time, avoiding the accumulation of server load. But its disadvantage is that the algorithm is relatively complicated, and it needs to monitor the number of connections and weight values of the server in real time.
