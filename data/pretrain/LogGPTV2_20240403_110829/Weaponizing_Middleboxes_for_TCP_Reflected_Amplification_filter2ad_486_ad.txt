received the fewest ampliﬁers, smallest total data elicited, and
smallest total ampliﬁcation: the (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) scan elicited
three orders of magnitude more data than an empty SYN scan.
Summary The (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) packet sequence with
www.youporn.com is overall the most effective at eliciting
ampliﬁcation, but other URLs and sequences are needed to
trigger speciﬁc, large networks.
5.2 Are these actually ampliﬁers?
We next explore if these IP addresses can be (ab)used for real-
world attacks. In a real attack, an attacker would not send just
one trigger packet sequence; instead, she would repeatedly
send trigger packet sequences to these IP addresses to amplify
the response trafﬁc. To test if the IP addresses we identify
are true ampliﬁers, we perform an experiment with the top 1
million IP addresses with the highest ampliﬁcation factor from
the (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) scan with www.youporn.com keyword.
Using ZMap, we perform two independent scans to these IP
addresses: ﬁrst, by sending 5 trigger packet sequences to each
IP address, and second (as a control), just one trigger packet
sequence5.
Figure 6 presents the increase factor: the ratio of bytes
we received from each IP address when sending 5 probes to
the bytes received from 1 probe. Perfect ampliﬁers have an
increase factor of 5×. Our results suggest that the majority of
the top 1 million IP addresses are true ampliﬁers. Over 46%
of IP addresses responded with exactly 5× as much data, and
5When sending multiple probes, we modify ZMap so that each probe is
sent from a different source port, so the packets are not identical.

another 30% responded with between 2× and 5× as much
data, likely representing ampliﬁers that missed or dropped
one or more of our packets. Notably, many of the IP addresses
that sent the most data do not increase by the same rate. Of
the top 100 ampliﬁers, none of them increased by exactly a
factor of 5×, and only 10 increased by 4–6×.
5.3 Are these middleboxes?
Next, we determine if the responses we receive are truly com-
ing from middleboxes. We performed a traceroute using a
custom ZMap probe module on the top million IP addresses
by bytes received in our (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) www.youporn.com
scan. Our ZMap module sent three TTL-limited TCP SYN
packets for each TTL between 10 and 25 to each of the million
hosts, and recorded the resulting ICMP TTL-exceeded mes-
sages. This allowed us to construct a (partial) traceroute for
each target for hops 10–25. Out of the million targets, 99.5%
provided at least one router hop, with an average of at least 6
hops per traceroute.
For each target, we extracted the last hop that we received
a TTL-exceeded message for (i.e., the last hop we learned
on the traceroute to the target). We then sent a follow up
(cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) sequence with www.youporn.com to the
target, but TTL-limited to the last known hop. This probe is
certain to not reach the target, as it should generate a TTL-
exceeded message by the last-hop router. Therefore, if we still
receive a response from the endpoint, we can tell the response
is coming from a middlebox along the path to the target, and
not the target itself.
If we do not receive a response, we cannot conclude that
responses normally come from the target endpoint, as it could
be that our traceroute was incomplete: there may be a mid-
dlebox further along the path but still before the endpoint.
However, we can interpret the presence of a response to our
TTL-limited probe as conﬁrmation that it was produced by a
middlebox.
Figure 7 shows the results of this scan, binning IP addresses
into bins of size 1,000 and plotting the fraction of the IPs in
Figure 7: The fraction of the top million hosts that we conﬁrm
are middleboxes, using TTL-limited probe. The small gap
at x ≈ 100,000 and the large gap in the middle of the plot
correspond to networks that block traceroutes at their borders.
Accounting for this, we ﬁnd injected responses from 82.9% of
the top million IP addresses are from conﬁrmed middleboxes.
the bin that we identiﬁed as middleboxes. Overall, 36.8% of
the 1M targets responded to our TTL-limited probe, positively
conﬁrming their responses were produced by a middlebox.
Notably present, however, are two gaps in the graph in which
almost no responses were received:
The small gap has ∼10,000 IP addresses (104,000 ≤ x ≤
114,000). All of these IPs are in three /20-sized subnets that be-
long to the Texas State Technical College Harlingen (TSTCH).
Their responses correspond to block pages generated by a Son-
icWall network security appliance, a common middlebox we
see in our data. It appears that TSTCH blocks traceroutes
at its border, meaning that our last-observed traceroute hop
occurs before the SonicWall appliance.
The larger gap has ∼465,000 IP addresses (213,000 ≤ x ≤
678,000). 98.6% of them geolocate to Saudi Arabia. Looking
at their traceroutes, their last hops comprise just 2,068 unique
router IPs, with 90% of IP addresses sharing only 10 last-
hop routers (all within Saudi Arabia). It appears that Saudi
Arabia also blocks traceroutes at their border, preventing us
from being able to traceroute into the country. However, the
response that comes back from 97% of the IP addresses in this
block corresponds to the standard block page of Saudi Arabian
censorship, describing that the website is blocked, and also
suggesting a middlebox is responsible for this response.
Conservatively labelling the 10,000 IP addresses from
TSTCH and 97% of the 465,000 Saudi Arabian IPs as en-
countering on-path middleboxes increases the percent of IPs
that encounter on-path middleboxes to 82.9% of the million
targets we scanned. We conclude that responses from the
vast majority of IP addresses in our dataset are produced by
middleboxes.
5.4 What kind of packets do ampliﬁers send?
We analyzed the packets we received in our (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105)
scan with www.youporn.com. This scan received a total of

over 105 GB of data from 337 million IP addresses. For each
IP address, we generate a ﬁngerprint from the response packet
sequence, consisting of a vector of (TCP flags, packet
size) tuples; this allows us to efﬁciently group IP addresses
that send us similar responses. We then counted the number
of IP addresses that sent each ﬁngerprint. We ignore order to
allow for packet re-ordering.
Overall, we discover 63,662 unique ﬁngerprints. Each
ﬁngerprint represents a unique set of packets sent by ampli-
ﬁers. The ﬁngerprint returned by the most IP addresses is
a sequence of three 54-byte RST+ACKs, which we received
from approximately 154 million IPs. This is a well-known
censorship pattern produced by the Great Firewall of China
(GFW) [6, 42], and using the MaxMind database [21], we
ﬁnd 99.9% of these IPs geolocate to China. We note this is
weakly-amplifying, sending 162 bytes for our 149 byte probe.
The ﬁngerprints representing the largest number of bytes
are less common. For example, the top ﬁngerprint is 528,007
410 byte FIN+PSH+ACK packets and 525,110 RST+ACKs, sent
by a single IP address in India. We investigate these mega-
ampliﬁers more in §6. The largest ﬁngerprints sent by more
than one IP address consist of a single SYN+ACK and multiple
megabytes worth of PSH+ACK packets containing data. These
appear to be sent by buggy TCP servers that simply respond
to our non-compliant GET request with real data. We ﬁnd
approximately 746,000 IP addresses with this behavior.
5.5 Are these national ﬁrewalls?
We ﬁnd that nation-state censorship infrastructure makes up
a signiﬁcant fraction of the TCP ampliﬁers we discover. Fig-
ure 8 breaks down the ampliﬁcation we see for the top 5
countries by number of amplifying IP addresses. Out of these,
all but the US have deployed nationwide Internet censorship
infrastructure [11, 12], visible by long ﬂat plateaus in the
graph which indicate a large number of IP addresses with
uniform ampliﬁcation. The US is a notable exception, and

try for the www.youporn.com scan with the (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105)
packet sequence.
we explore why it is so prevalent later in this section. Ampli-
ﬁcation factors vary signiﬁcantly country-to-country due to
different censorship methods.
By extracting ﬁngerprints that were shared by many IP
addresses that geolocate to the same country, we can identify
censoring nation-states. For example, over a million IP ad-
dresses geolocate to Bangladesh and respond with a 248-byte
FIN+PSH+ACK. Table 4 shows a sample of censoring coun-
tries and their most popular ﬁngerprint. At a slightly higher
ampliﬁcation, we observe four similar ﬁngerprints with two
packets each: a 402–405-byte FIN+PSH+ACK and a 54-byte
RST+PSH+ACK. We received these ﬁngerprints from 8.6 mil-
lion IP addresses in Iran, representing 76% of all the respond-
ing IP addresses that geolocate to Iran.
The censorship infrastructure of Saudi Arabia also shows
prominently in our dataset: its ﬁngerprint is three packets:
a 97-byte PSH+ACK and two 1354-byte PSH+ACKs, offering
an ampliﬁcation factor of 18.9×. We received this ﬁnger-
print from over 400K IP addresses, 99% of which geolocate
to Saudi Arabia, comprising 45% of all the responding IP
addresses that geolocate to Saudi Arabia.
In general, we ﬁnd the ampliﬁcation factor from nation-
state censors is small: most countries we surveyed provide
less than 4× ampliﬁcation. The GFW of China is the largest—
but also the weakest—ampliﬁer we ﬁnd. Curiously, we ﬁnd
that the GFW has a different ﬁngerprint between two of
our scans: the (cid:104)SYN; PSH+ACK(cid:105) scan with plus.google.com
elicited three RST+ACKs and a RST packet, but this extra RST
packet is missing in scans for www.youporn.com. This RST
was also absent when plus.google.com was sent with the
(cid:104)SYN; PSH(cid:105) sequence. The presence of the RST raises the am-
pliﬁcation factor of the GFW from 1.08× to 1.45×.
We do not understand why the GFW behaves differently
between these keywords and sequences. Researchers have hy-
pothesized that the RST+ACK and RST packets from the GFW
originate from different, co-located censorship systems [6,42];
our results support this theory, and even suggest that the block
lists themselves can be processed differently between the two
censorship systems depending on the sequences of packets.

didate looping IP addresses when scanned with a TTL of 255
and 64. Because the increase factor is affected by the number
of hops away an IP address is, we expect routing loops to have
an increase factor of at least 4. Larger increase factors are fur-
ther away from our scanner, limiting the overall ampliﬁcation
factor from our perspective.
Figure 10: The /24 preﬁxes with at least one routing loop,
rank-ordered by the fraction of their 256 IP addresses that
we observe to loop. Of the 2,763 looping preﬁxes, 54 (2%)
have over 90% of their IP addresses loop, but 1,705 (62%)
have only one looping IP address. (Note that the x-axis is
log-scale.)
We also discover hundreds of IP addresses in routing loops
in Russia that contain censoring middleboxes with 250.9×
ampliﬁcation. The highest amplifying nation-state censors
are two censoring ISPs located in Russia that seem to have
inﬁnite routing loops in their network, that sent us packets
for weeks after our scans. We examine the effects of routing
loops more closely next in §5.6.
Nation-state censors pose a more signiﬁcant threat to the
Internet than their ampliﬁcation factor alone suggests. First,
nation-state censorship infrastructure is located at high-speed
ISPs, and is capable of sending and injecting data at incredibly
high bandwidths. This allows an attacker to amplify larger
amounts of trafﬁc without worry of ampliﬁer saturation. Sec-
ond, the enormous pool of source IP addresses that can be
used to trigger ampliﬁcation attacks makes it difﬁcult for vic-
tims to simply block a handful of reﬂectors [29]. Nation-state
censors effectively turn every routable IP addresses within
their country into a potential ampliﬁer.
While nation-state censors are well-represented in our am-
pliﬁers dataset, other large non-censoring countries, such as
the US, are prevalent as well. Speciﬁcally for the US, we
observe a more diverse set of ﬁngerprints: over 13,000 unique
ﬁngerprints, compared to 7,553 in Russia, and under 3,000
from South Korea. This indicates a diversity of networks,
rather than a coordinated, nationwide deployment. Indeed,
we observe several university and enterprise ﬁrewalls that
respond with identiﬁable and amplifying ﬁngerprints.
These results demonstrate that nation-state censors enable
TCP ampliﬁcation attacks, but that they are far from the sole
