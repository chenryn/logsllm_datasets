by **PI:EMAIL** :
    I posted this to go-nuts before realizing that this is probably a better place for this.
    I apologize for the duplication.
    Using code.google.com/p/go.net/html to parse and then re-render a chunk of HTML I
    believe results in improper escaping of single quotes within double quotes. Here is a
    simple test program that parses and re-renders a bit of HTML:
    package main
    import (
        "bytes"
        "fmt"
        "log"
        "strings"
        "testing"
        "code.google.com/p/go.net/html"
    )
    func main() {
        data := ``
        doc, err := html.Parse(strings.NewReader(data))
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("html.Parse returned %s", err)
            return
        }
        var b bytes.Buffer
        err = Render(&b, doc)
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("html.Render returned %s", err)
            return
        }
        fmt.Printf("%s\n", b.String())
    }
    The single quotes are improperly escaped in the re-rendered code. 
    I believe the original HTML is valid. I've attached a small patch that fixes the
    problem. 
    Thanks,
    Mark
