User: I'm working by myself right now, but am looking at ways to scale my operation. 
I'd like to find an easy way to version my Python distribution, so that I can recreate it very easily. Is there a tool to do this? Or can I add /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ (or whatever) to an svn repo? This doesn't solve the problems with PATHs, but I can always write a script to alter the path. Ideally, the solution would be to build my Python env in a VM, and then hand copies of the VM out.
How have other people solved this?
Assistant: For the same goal, i.e. having the exact same Python distribution as my colleagues, I tried to create a virtual environment in a network drive, so that everybody of us would be able to use it, without anybody making his local copy.
The idea was to share the same packages installed in a shared folder.
Outcome: Python run so unbearably slow that it could not be used. Also installing a package was very very sluggish.
So it looks there is no other way than using virtualenv and a requirements file. (Even if unfortunately often it does not always work smoothly on Windows and it requires manual installation of some packages and dependencies, at least at this time of writing.)
