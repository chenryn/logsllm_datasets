### Appendix: Ticking Timebomb Trigger Variants

In these Verilog examples of Ticking Timebomb Triggers (TTTs), we use a three-letter naming convention to describe their building blocks:
- SSC type (C or D): Coalesced (C) or Distributed (D)
- Increment value (U or N): Uniform (U) or Non-uniform (N)
- Increment event (P or S): Periodic (P) or Sporadic (S)

For example, a CNS TTT indicates a Coalesced (C) SSC, with a Non-uniform (N) increment value, and a Sporadic (S) increment event. For TTTs comprised of distributed SSCs, we use the "D-" naming convention to indicate the type: homogeneous or heterogeneous. This list is not comprehensive but rather a representative sampling of the TTT design space. Note that all examples assume a processor victim circuit, with a pageFault flag, overflow flag, and a 32-bit program counter (PC) register.

#### Example: CUP (Coalesced SSC, Uniform increment, Periodic event)

```verilog
reg [31:0] ssc;

always @ (posedge clock) begin
    if (reset) begin
        ssc <= 0;
    end else begin
        // Increment ssc by a uniform value periodically
        ssc <= ssc + 1;
    end
end
```

### Figure 11: Hardware Data-Flow Graph

Example data-flow graph, generated by Bomberman, of an open-source floating-point division unit [19]. Bomberman cross-references this graph with verification simulation results to identify SSCs (red). In the graph, rectangles represent registers (flip-flops), and ellipses represent intermediate signals (outputs from combinational logic). Red rectangles indicate coalesced SSCs, while red ellipses represent distributed SSCs.
