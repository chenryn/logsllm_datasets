Abstract—Sybil attacks in which an adversary forges a
potentially unbounded number of identities are a danger to
distributed systems and online social networks. The goal of
sybil defense is to accurately identify sybil identities.
This paper surveys the evolution of sybil defense protocols
that leverage the structural properties of the social graph
underlying a distributed system to identify sybil identities. We
make two main contributions. First, we clarify the deep con-
nection between sybil defense and the theory of random walks.
This leads us to identify a community detection algorithm that,
for the ﬁrst time, offers provable guarantees in the context of
sybil defense. Second, we advocate a new goal for sybil defense
that addresses the more limited, but practically useful, goal of
securely white-listing a local region of the graph.
I. INTRODUCTION
The possibility that malicious users may forge an un−
bounded number of sybil identities, indistinguishable from
honest ones, is a fundamental threat to distributed systems
that rely on voting [11]. This threat is particularly acute
in decentralized systems, where it may be impractical or
impossible to rely on a single authority to certify which users
are legitimate [20]. The goal of sybil defense is to accurately
identify sybil identities1—“ideally, the system should accept
all legitimate identities but no counterfeit entities” [11]—
but simple techniques can be either too brittle (beating a
CAPTCHA [40] costs a fraction of a cent) or too blunt (IP
ﬁltering penalizes all users behind a NAT).
Against this background, Yu et al. have put forward a rad−
ically different approach [45], [46]: protecting a distributed
system by leveraging the social network that connects its
users. Intuitively, as long as sybil identities are unable to
create too many attack edges connecting them to honest
identities, it may be possible to separate the wheat from the
chaff by analyzing the topological structure of the users’
social graph. This style of sybil defense2 promises not only
to be more surgical, but offers a mathematically precise
and elegant way to characterize the robustness of a sybil
defense technique in terms of the number of attack edges it
can handle. The vision is to offer universal sybil defense
to all honest nodes in the system: as long as the social
graph conforms to certain assumptions, an honest node will
1Although this goal may be more accurately characterized as sybil
detection [38], we use here the term sybil defense originally proposed by
Yu [45] and widely adopted in the literature.

to techniques that leverage the structure of social networks.
correctly classify almost all honest nodes in the graph while
rejecting all but a bounded number of sybil nodes [45].
Several protocols that embrace this style of sybil de−
[7], [10], [35], [42],
fense have since been proposed
[45], [46] and higher−level distributed applications that rely
on them are beginning to emerge [18], [19], [26], [36].

The ﬁrst goal of this paper is to examine the promise
and the fundamental limits of universal sybil defense. We
will see that at
the core of this approach are a set of
assumptions about the structure of a social graph under
sybil attacks that, in essence, amount to modeling the social
graph as consisting of two sparsely connected regions: one
comprised of sybil nodes; and the other of honest nodes,
homogeneously connected with one another. We will report
on several studies, conﬁrmed by our own experiments, that
suggest that this model over−simpliﬁes the social structure
of the honest region of the graph: rather than homogeneous,
this region appears as a collection of tightly−knit
local
communities relatively loosely coupled with one another.
Our second goal for this paper is then to advocate a
realignment of the focus of sybil defense to leverage ef−
fectively the robustness of communities to sybil inﬁltration.
The intuition that motivates us is not new. Prior work has
suggested casting sybil defense as a community detection
problem [39] and asked whether it is possible to use off−the−
shelf community detection algorithms to ﬁnd sybils. On this
front, we make two contributions. First, we show that this
approach requires extreme caution, as the choice of the com−
munity detection protocol can dramatically affect whether
sybil nodes are accepted as honest. Second, we identify the
mathematical foundations on which the connection between
sybil defense and community detection rests: we identify a
well−founded theory and point to an established literature to
guide the development of future sybil defense protocols.
Our conclusion is that instead of aiming for universal
coverage, sybil defense should settle for a more limited
goal: offering honest nodes the ability to white−list a set
of nodes of any given size, ranked accordingly to their
trustworthiness. We believe that this is a good bargain, and
not just because it results in a goal that, unlike its alternative,
is attainable, but because (1) the guarantees it provides are
in practice what nodes that engage in crowd−sourcing [47]
or cooperative P2P applications [9], [25] need, and (2) the
computational cost of providing these guarantees depends

only on the size of the desired white−listed set rather than,
as in techniques that aim for universal sybil defense, on the
total number of identities in the network.
The ﬁnal goal of this paper is to serve as a warning against
the danger of falling into a Maginot syndrome: the building
of an ever more sophisticated line of defense against attacks
that the enemy can easily circumvent. Indeed, evidence from
the RenRen social network [43] shows sybil attacks that
differ from what current sybil defenses anticipate and that,
despite their simplicity, can be devastating. We argue that
the key to address this challenge is defense in depth, where
early defense layers (of which we sketch a few) are designed
to catch the simple sybil subgraphs that current defenses are
ill−equipped to detect.
Finally, a friendly warning. Achieving the goals we have
outlined requires a good mathematical understanding of the
problem and of the techniques developed to address it.
At times the discussion will be technical; we hope that
the persevering reader will be rewarded. Bear with us.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 examines four
fundamental structural properties of social graphs (popular−
ity, small world property, clustering coefﬁcient, and con−
ductance) and asks: which can better serve as a foundation
for sybil defense? The answer, we ﬁnd, is conductance,
a property intimately related to the concept of mixing
time of a random walk. We then proceed in Section 3 to
discuss protocols that exploit variations in conductance as
a basis for decentralized universal sybil defense [10], [35],
[42], [45], [46]. These protocols provide elegant worst−case
guarantees when it comes to their vulnerability to sybil
attacks; however, these guarantees are critically sensitive
to a set of assumptions that do not appear to hold in
actual social networks [6], [17], [23]. This motivates us
to explore, beginning with Section 4, an alternative goal
for sybil defense that leverages two observations: (1) social
graphs have an internal structure organized around tightly−
knit communities and (2) the graph properties crucial for
sybil defense are signiﬁcantly more likely to hold within a
community rather than in the entire social graph. Section
5 reviews recent work on the theory of random walks
that provides a solid theoretical foundation to sybil defense
based on community detection; we deepen our investigation
of random walks in Section 6, where we show how the
well−known concept of Personalized PageRank (not to be
confused with PageRank itself) offers honest nodes a path
towards a realistic target for sybil defense that
is more
limited than universal coverage but nonetheless useful: a
way to white−list trustworthy nodes that proves efﬁcient
and robust in both theory and practice. After all this effort,
Section 7 greets us with a sobering result: in spite of their
sophistication, state of the art sybil defense protocols are
helpless against very crude real−life sybil attacks. However,
we show that sybil defense protocols based on random walks
continue to be effective when used in combination with
very simple checks that leverage structural properties of
the social graph other than conductance. Section 8 offers
our conclusions and points to directions for possible future
research.
II. SYBIL DEFENSE VIA SOCIAL NETWORKS
it
Sybil defense via social networks is predicated on the
assumption that
is possible to leverage the structural
properties of the social graph G underlying a distributed
system to differentiate the honest subgraph H from the
sybil subgraph S. In this section, we ask a basic question:
which structural property, if any, is most promising towards
defending against sybil attacks?
A. Structural properties of social graphs
We consider (and brieﬂy review below) four well−known
structural properties that are commonly viewed as charac−
terizing social graphs: the popularity distribution among its
nodes [5], the small world property [41], the value of its
clustering coefﬁcient [41] and its conductance [17].
Popularity: The node degree distribution of social graphs
is heavy−tailed, as in a power−law or lognormal distribution.
Small world property: The diameter of a social graph—
i.e., the longest distance between any two nodes in the
graph—is small.
Clustering coefﬁcient: A measure of how closely−knit is
a social network. When we associate a network vertex v with
the user u that it represents, the vertex’ clustering coefﬁcient
cv is the ratio between the actual number of friendships
between the friends of u and the maximum possible number
of friendships between them. Formally, let fv denote the
actual number of edges between neighbors of v, i.e. fv :=
(cid:2)
|{xy : x ∈ Nv, y ∈ Nv, xy ∈ E}; and let k be the maximum
, where
number of edges between neighbors of v: k =
fv
deg(v) denotes v’s degree. Then, cv :=
k . The clustering
coefﬁcient of a graph is the average clustering coefﬁcient of
all its vertices, i.e. c(G) :=
(cid:4)
deg(v)
v∈V (G)
cv|V | .
(cid:3)
2
Conductance: Social graphs are conjectured to be fast-
mixing, meaning that if we take a random walk in a social
graph we will quickly arrive at a random point. This property
is at the core of many solutions developed for sybil defense.
A graph’s mixing time [30], which informally conveys the
minimum length of a random walk that ends on a uniformly
random edge, is intimately related to the concept of con−
ductance: when conductance is high, mixing time is low.
Intuitively, the conductance of a set S of vertices, denoted
by ϕ(S), in a given network is the ratio between the number
of edges going out from S and the number of edges inside
S. More precisely, given a set of vertices S, the conductance
of the set is deﬁned as
|cut(S)|
vol(S)
ϕ(S) :=
