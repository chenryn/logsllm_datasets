### Bug Report

#### Electron Version
- 1.8.7 / 2.0.0

#### Operating System
- Platform: Windows 10

#### Last Known Working Electron Version

### Expected Behavior
The `webview` should remain available and interactive after the `window.close()` method is called.

### Actual Behavior
Every time the `webview` executes `window.close()`, it crashes, making the `webview` unresponsive.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saenzramiro/electron-window-close-bug.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   electron .
   ```

### Additional Information
I discovered this issue while using Slack. Every time you log in or log out, Slack redirects to a page that executes `window.close()`. I searched for this issue but couldn't find any related reports. Apologies if this is a duplicate.
