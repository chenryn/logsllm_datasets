**Expected Behavior**  
Keep the webview available to interact.
**Actual behavior**  
Every time the webview execute `window.close()`, it's crashing the webview
itself.
**To Reproduce**
    $ git clone https://github.com/saenzramiro/electron-window-close-bug.git
    $ npm install
    $ npm start || electron .
**Additional Information**  
I realized this because of Slack's. Every time you log in or log out, they
redirect to a page that executes `window.close()`. I searched of this here but
no luck, sorry if this is duplicated.
