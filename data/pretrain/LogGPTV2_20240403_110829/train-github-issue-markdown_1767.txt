Reading Rust documentation online can sometimes be confusing, as it may not always be up-to-date with the latest version of the language. To help users determine the relevance of the documentation, the output generated by `rustdoc` should include the date and version number of the crate. This information would make it easier to identify whether the documentation is current and applicable.
