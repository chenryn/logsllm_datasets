**Issue details / Repro steps / Use case background** : We have a RecyclerView
and each item contains ImageView  
In Recycler view adapter's onBind() method, We have Glide request for that
image loading.
## Scenario (Duplicate Image Request)
  1. Activity loads
  2. Image request is gone and under process
  3. We scroll fast and comes back to same position(Note that image is still not loaded), the same image request is gone again.
  4. Once image is cached, the view will have the image from cache.
**Glide load line /`GlideModule` (if any) / list Adapter code (if any)**:
    Glide.with(context).load(url)
                .diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.SOURCE)
                .into(viewHolder.imageView);
