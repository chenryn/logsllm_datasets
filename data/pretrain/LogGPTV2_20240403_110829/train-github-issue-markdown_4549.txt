### Issue Details / Reproduction Steps / Use Case Background
We are experiencing an issue with duplicate image requests in a `RecyclerView` where each item contains an `ImageView`. In the `onBind()` method of the `RecyclerView` adapter, we use Glide to load images.

#### Scenario (Duplicate Image Request)
1. The activity loads.
2. An image request is initiated and is in progress.
3. The user scrolls quickly and returns to the same position before the image has finished loading. This causes the same image request to be initiated again.
4. Once the image is cached, the view will display the image from the cache.

### Glide Load Line / `GlideModule` (if any) / List Adapter Code (if any)
```java
Glide.with(context).load(url)
    .diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.SOURCE)
    .into(viewHolder.imageView);
```

### Layout XML
