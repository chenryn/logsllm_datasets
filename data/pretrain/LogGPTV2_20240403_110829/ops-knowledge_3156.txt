User: I am a pretty recent developer..
but I have a single monitor (big enough) but it is so annoying that every now and then I first use the text editor to write the code and then go to terminal to execute and debug
I was wondering if there is any developer tools where I can like use half screen for that note pad and the other half for terminal.. so that I dont have to shuffle back and forth between the terminal and the text-editor...
Something like, when this software is running... then notepad and terminal just freezes in that half screen and when i close this software I can minimize and turn to normal mode.
If not it would be cool thing to have. :D
THanks
Assistant: If you're developing in Python - have a look at PyCharm. It's a clone of IntelliJ IDEA, tailored for python development, written in Java, so work on any platform. If you like it, it also doesn't cost a whole truckload.
That's for the easy and money-based way. More complex ways - you can use a text editor that allows running your scripts, upload to webservers, whatnot. It pretty much depends on the stuff you're developing.
