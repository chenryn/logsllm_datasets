User: Can I serve PHP and python on a single project in app engine?
for example 
/php/* will run php code, but the root / will run python code.
Assistant: You can (and many do) use a front-end like nginx or Apache that handles and forwards different paths differently. I do not see why you would want your application engine to be "bilingual" though.
