Hi, may I ask whether or not this can be made more flexible?
We have a project structure that puts the app's content inside the
**wwwroot/app** directory that also contains the HTMLs etc, so having a
seperate, forced "scripts" directory which outputs there is nothing more than
an (unnecessary?) workaround.
The structure is like the following:
    - wwwroot
      - app
        app.ts
        - module
          module.ts
          - controllers (*.ts)
          - services (*.ts)
          - views (*.html)
      index.html    
It would be great to have the tsconfig.json just in the "app" directory and it
then compiles all .ts that are anywhere below that path, like it is the case
with the tsconfig right now, however forced to expect them in the "scripts"
dir.
Honestly, I think compile-on-save seems unnecessary given the presence of a
tsconfig file. The regular way seems way better since when building the
project it compiles the TS if missing, compile-on-save seems not to (plus
you'd have to expect team members to make sure to enable it and go through all
their files).
It would be a great help to be able to drop a tsconfig.json in **any**
directory, not just the (seemingly) hard-coded "scripts" directory, or at
least being able to adjust this path.
I tested this with the RC 1 Update 1 and it is quite unflexible there. If
there is progress made in that area, please let me know.
Thanks in advance and best regards,
