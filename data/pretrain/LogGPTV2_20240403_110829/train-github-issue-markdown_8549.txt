Subject: Request for More Flexible Project Structure and tsconfig.json Configuration

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to discuss the possibility of making our project structure more flexible, particularly in relation to the `tsconfig.json` configuration.

Currently, our project follows this structure:

```
- wwwroot
  - app
    - app.ts
    - module
      - module.ts
      - controllers (*.ts)
      - services (*.ts)
      - views (*.html)
  - index.html
```

The current setup requires a separate "scripts" directory for TypeScript compilation, which seems like an unnecessary workaround. Ideally, we would like to place the `tsconfig.json` file directly in the "app" directory, allowing it to compile all `.ts` files located in any subdirectory below it. This approach is already supported by the `tsconfig.json` file, but it is currently restricted to the "scripts" directory.

Additionally, the compile-on-save feature appears to be redundant when a `tsconfig.json` file is present. The standard build process, which compiles TypeScript files as needed, is more efficient and reliable. Compile-on-save not only adds an extra step but also requires team members to manually enable it, which can lead to inconsistencies.

To improve flexibility, it would be beneficial if we could place the `tsconfig.json` file in any directory, not just the hard-coded "scripts" directory, or at least have the option to configure this path.

I tested this with RC 1 Update 1 and found the current implementation to be quite inflexible. If there have been any recent updates or progress in this area, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Best regards,
Chris
