User: How to diagnose and solve the problem of high CPU utilization when multiple applications are running on a server at the same time?
Assistant: 1. Use the performance monitor tool: Use the performance monitor tool to monitor CPU utilization. The Windows system provides two tools with performance monitoring functions, Task Manager and Resource Monitor, which can check the CPU utilization of each process and service. Under the Linux system, commonly used performance monitors include top, htop, and iotop. 2. Find system bottlenecks: Find related system bottlenecks according to the process names of applications with high CPU utilization. For example, if a certain database has a high CPU utilization, you can check whether there are too many database connections, whether the query statement is too complicated, and so on. 3. Analyze logs: Check the application logs to see if there are abnormal errors or warnings, and whether frequent garbage collection occurs. 4. Adjust configuration: According to the results of system bottleneck and log analysis, adjust the configuration of the system or application appropriately. For example, adjust the size of the database connection pool, caching mechanism, etc. 5. Optimize the code: If the system configuration has been adjusted to the extreme, but the problem still cannot be solved, the code may need to be optimized. There are many ways to optimize code, such as optimizing algorithms, reducing the number of loops, and using data structures reasonably. 6. Increase hardware resources: If none of the above methods can solve the problem, you may need to increase hardware resources. For example, increase the number of CPU cores and memory capacity.
