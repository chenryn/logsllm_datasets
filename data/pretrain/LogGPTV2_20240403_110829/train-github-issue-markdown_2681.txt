Hello,
I want to apologize first if someone ask it before, I did a lot of searches,
and I didn't find an answer, so.. as I don't know if that's an issue or not, I
post it there.
I have, for many events (but not all) the following issue :  
My listeners are called 2 times whereas I only send it once (I'm sure about
it, I did a lot of tests) when I call next({}).
An example ?  
The call :
https://github.com/Peekmo/angular2-leap/blob/master/src/app/components/link-
element/link-element.ts#L38  
The template that call the component :
https://github.com/Peekmo/angular2-leap/blob/master/src/app/components/page/page.html#L7  
The function that is called twice for one .next() :
https://github.com/Peekmo/angular2-leap/blob/master/src/app/components/page/page.ts#L23
(note : I'm forced to do that ugly timeout to avoid to do 2 times the same
thing)
Is that normal ? Do I do something wrong ? (I have some listener in the same
app that are only called once, and other twice so that's weird..)  
If you never heard about that, that's probably an issue into my app.
Thank you ! üëç
