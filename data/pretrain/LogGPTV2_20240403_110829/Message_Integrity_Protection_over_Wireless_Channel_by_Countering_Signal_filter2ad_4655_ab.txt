effectively decode the message using brute force.
On the other hand, [19] and [20] also use RA to ran-
domize wireless channel, which is similar to us. However,
[19] and [20] focus on protecting the secrecy of generated
key. More speciﬁcally, [19] and [20] utilize the reciprocity
of radio wave to create the same received signal strength
indicator (RSSI) sequence at the transmitter and receiver,
then extract a common secret key from the received RSSI
sequence. Thus, the main purpose of [19] and [20] to use
RA is to prevent the eavesdropper from obtaining the exact
CSI between legitimate pairs. While an eavesdropper can
use ofﬂine methods to estimate the CSI more accurately,
a signal cancellation attack must be launched in an online
fashion, which fundamentally changes how we model the
attacker. Actually, for our type II attacker, it is assumed to
be capable of obtaining exact channel for every symbol. The
main idea to defend type II attacker is to capture the online
nature of signal cancellation attack process, and exploit
the randomness of CSI in temporal domain to prevent the
attacker from predicting future CSI. Besides, the indepen-
dence of the generated key between legitimate pairs and
the key obtained by the eavesdropper is crucial criterion for
secret generation, however, for signal cancellation attack, the
energy detection probability is the most important criterion
that needs to pay attention to.
2.2.2 Countering Active Attacks
Except for defending against passive attackers like eaves-
droppers, channel randomization can also be used to
counter active attacks such like jamming. For example, [21]
proposes a mechanical beam-forming approach and auto-
conﬁguration algorithm to track the powerful jammer and
weaken its signal. In [21], the attacker emits a powerful jam-
ming signal to interfere with the communication between
legitimate pairs. By changing the angle and distance of
the two antennas placed at the receiver, the optimal beam
pattern which maximizes the signal-to-jamming (SJR) can
be conﬁgured and cancel the jamming signal. However,
signal cancellation attack is different from tradition jamming
attack (where the jamming signal is not correlated with the
legitimate signal). First, the goal in our work is to prevent
legitimate signal from being canceled, while in jamming
they aim at canceling out the external signal. Second, the
strategies that are proposed to defend jammers are not suit-
able for our model. The key to signal cancellation attack is
the energy detection probability, therefore, a more powerful
4

traditional jamming signal actually strengthens the received
signal, which enhances the energy detection probability and
helps to protect message integrity. Besides, since the signal
cancellation attack can be carried out on every symbol,
forming antenna beams mechanically is too slow to counter
signal cancellation attack in practice.
Our previous work [1] achieves message integrity pro-
tection over signal cancellation by using an electric fan
blowing the aluminum foil strips attached on the transmit-
ter to introduce external disturbance in wireless channel.
However, the disturbance introduced by a fan is tiny. Con-
sidering that two channels which are close to each other
are highly correlated [22], [23], it might be the case that
the attacker can cancel out most part of the received signal
power via powerful devices. Besides, randomizing wireless
channel via fan is not a systematic way in practice. Taken
the considerations above, we propose to randomize wireless
channel via RA in this paper. Many parameters in our
new approach are controllable, which provides us a more
systematic way to study the performance and security of
the wireless system.
2.3 Quantifying Adversary’s Knowledge in Signal Can-
cellation Attack
Previous results on the signal cancellation attack are qual-
itative [11], which show that a static environment leads to
higher chance of cancellation. Signal cancellation attack can
be seen as one of the special cases of tradition correlated
jamming. In M´edard’s work on studying the capacity of
wireless channels under correlated jamming, the channel
is assumed to be constant and known by the jammer [24].
Later, Kashyap et. al. expand the study on channel capacity
under correlated jamming to MIMO case and assume the
CSI is totally random and the attacker only knows the
statistics [14]. Some other theoretical results in correlated
jamming follow similar assumption, that is, the legitimate
pair’s CSI h is assumed to be either perfectly known by
the attacker, or not known but only statistics are available.
However, in practice this is often not the case. Instead, the
attacker’s knowledge about the channel can lie between
these two extremes. And how to quantify the attacker’s
capability remained as an open problem. Intuitively, the
more accurate the attacker could estimate the legitimate
pair’s channel h, the more effective it could launch the corre-
lated jamming attack. Therefore, we can use the correlation
coefﬁcient rhg to quantize the attacker’s capability, where g
denotes the attacker’s estimation of h.
Generally, the attacker can exploit correlations in three
domains to obtain knowledge of legitimate h: spatial do-
main, temporal domain, and frequency domain. In the
spatial dimension, previous works [22], [23] demonstrated
high correlations between channels where the receivers (or
transmitters) are close to each other (typically within half
wavelength). He et. al. [25] even showed that the attacker
can obtain a very accurate estimation of the legitimate
pair’s channel by placing multiple eavesdroppers around
the legitimate receiver. The idea is to let all the eavesdrop-
pers measure the channel simultaneously, and then combine
them into a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimator. The estimation error can decrease to zero with
increased number of eavesdroppers in some cases.
Fig. 2: Example of CSI prediction attack.
It has also been shown by previous works that channel
is self-correlated in temporal domain. The correlated time
scale is typically measured by the channel coherence time,
which is usually several ms in dynamic environments and
hundreds of ms in static environments.
Similarly, channel correlation exists in the frequency
domain. The attacker can also exploit CSI measurements
made in adjacent channels to derive a better estimate of the
CSI in the frequency used by the legitimate pair.
In a word, the attacker could leverage channel corre-
lation in any of the three domains and combine them.
Such correlation should be considered in the threat model
and design of any anti-signal-cancellation based integrity
protection scheme.
In this paper, we ﬁrst derive a theoretic result showing
that the attacker’s successful cancellation probability in-
creases with its channel correlation with the legitimate one.
However, in reality it is difﬁcult (if not impossible) to know
the attacker’s capabilities in advance (e.g., location, device
type, number), and it seems hopeless to upper-bound the
attacker’s knowledge about the legitimate channel. Fortu-
nately, since signal cancellation is an active attack, it is only
effective when attacker’s signal is in the same frequency.
Also, it must be timely – attacker’s channel estimation needs
to be done in real-time without any delay, otherwise the
cancellation opportunity will be missed. Therefore, even
though the attacker can accurately measure the historical
legitimate CSI via spatial and frequency domain correlation,
it still needs to predict the CSI in the present (and future) in
order to generate its own correlated signal (illustrated in Fig.
2). Any approach to obtain the current channel knowledge
through measurements takes time, and after that the optimal
cancellation opportunity is already missed. That means, we
can exploit the intrinsic time-domain unpredictability of the
legitimate channel to prevent it from knowing the future
CSI. To do so, in our scheme the legitimate TX/RX quantify
the CSI’s self-correlation in the time domain and use that to
bound the knowledge of attacker. On the other hand, from
the attacker’s point of view, except for CSI prediction attack,
processing and relaying the received signal which results in
a correlated version of legitimate signal at the receiver, if
attacker’s physical channel is directly correlated with the
legitimate one is also a feasible strategy. In this case, the key
to defending strategy is to increase the randomness of CSI
in spatial domain instead of temporal domain.
3 MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS
3.1 System Model
In our model, Alice communicates with Bob through a wire-
less channel. There are two types of transmission modes.
In the ﬁrst one (normal mode) a message is transmitted
PAN et al.: MESSAGE INTEGRITY PROTECTION OVER WIRELESS CHANNEL: COUNTERING SIGNAL CANCELLATION VIA CHANNEL RANDOMIZATION

Fig. 3: The system model
using standard modulation and data rates, such as 802.11
and OFDM. The second one is called the ON/OFF keying
mode, where information bits (like the hash of a normal
message) are all encoded using ON/OFF keying combined
with unidirectional error detection codes (e.g., Manchester
coding). In each ON slot, a normal packet with random
content is transmitted, while in OFF slots Alice remains
silent. For this mode, Bob uses energy detection to decode
the received signal. Periodically (e.g., per symbol interval),
Bob obtains a received signal strength (RSS) and compares
it with a threshold (α). If the RSS is larger than α for
Ns samples then an ON slot is detected. We assume each
transmitted signal x ∈ C is arbitrary. The channel state
h ∈ C between Alice and Bob is modeled under Rayleigh
fading with additive white Gaussian noise n in outdoor
environments, and Rician model in indoor environments.
3.2 Threat Model
The attacker’s general goal is to break integrity protection,
i.e., modify the message without being detected. For the nor-
mal mode, we assume the adversary can arbitrarily eaves-
drop, inject, modify, replay, and block the message (standard
Dolev-Yao model). For the ON/OFF keying mode, we as-
sume an attacker C who knows the exact transmitted signal
x, and C’s goal is to cancel out the signal received at Bob.
To learn x in real-time, C can place a directional antenna
closely to the legitimate transmitter A. To create and deliver
a correlated signal at B, C will utilize x and her ”knowledge”
about the CSI h from A to B. Essentially, C possesses a
correlated version of h denoted as g (correlation coefﬁcient
denoted as r ∈ [0, 1]), as shown in Fig. 3.
There are three types of attackers in our model depend-
ing on their attack modes. We always assume the attacker
cannot replace A or B, or simply block the communication
using a Faraday Cage. We do not restrict the number and
type of devices the attacker may have. It can either generate
its own signals or process and relay the signals from A to B.
Type I: This type of attacker relies on statistical or back-
ground information to estimate h, but makes no effort to
obtain the accurate measurement of h. For example, channel
propagation models can be used to derive the stable (Line-
of-Sight/LoS) part of the CSI based on the distance, and
large-scale fading/shadowing effects can also be predicted.
However, the attacker cannot derive a correlated version
for the dynamic/small-scale part. This model is adopted by
[11] under a stable indoor scenario, where A-B, A-C and C-B
channels are all assumed constant.
Type II: This type of attacker can obtain up-to-date and
correlated estimation g about A to B’s CSI using information
from any of the three domains mentioned in the previous
section. For example, it could place multiple receivers close
to B, and measure the channel for each transmitted symbol
continuously. In the worst case, it obtains the exact A-B
channel for every symbol in the past and uses them to
predict the future CSI. After estimating h as g, the attacker
can decide the cancellation strategy a and send its own
signal agx to B.
Type III: Note that type II attack model is too theoretical
to be used in practice since it requires the attacker to place
multiple receivers to measure the channel and combine all
estimations, which is costly and computationally complex.
Actually, the attacker can easily relay the correlated source
signal after processing with one device. Thus, we propose
type III attacker to model a more practical attacker. Instead
of estimating and predicting future CSI, a type III attacker
exploits the intrinsic spatial correlation between channel A-
C and A-B, by multiplying the received correlated source
signal from A (gx) with cancellation strategy a and relaying
it to the receiver via a stable channel (or the other way
around). Though in practice, the attacker cannot send its
signal to the receiver without any attenuation, the attacker
can use powerful directional antennas to relay processed
signal to the receiver, for which the channel can be regarded
as stable. Note that the type III attacker is more general
than that in [11], since in our model the attacker is capable
of processing received signal before relaying it, whereas in
[11] the attacker only relays the signal.
In a word, the Type I attacker could only get the knowl-
edge about the stable part of CSI, while the type II and III
attacker could also get partial knowledge of the dynamic
part. We note that the type II and type III attack models
are stronger than previous works [10], [11], [15], [16], as
the attacker can do real-time signal processing to generate
a correlated cancellation signal based on source x and the
correlated CSI. In addition, type III is more practical than
type II attacker, since it is easier to implement in practice.
4 OPTIMAL STRATEGIES FOR SIGNAL CANCELLA-
TION ATTACK AND DEFENSE
4.1 Game Theoretic Framework
In this section, we theoretically analyze the signal cancel-
lation attack for one symbol in an ON slot. We model the
cancellation and anti-cancellation process as a game. The
attacker’s goal is to transmit a signal correlated with x such
that the detection probability Pd of the combined received
signal is minimized at B. Therefore we deﬁne the attacker’s
utility function as Ua = −Pd. The legitimate pair’s strategy
is to maximize the energy detection probability and their
utility function is Ul = Pd. Obviously, this is a zero-sum
game.
For the strategy space, let the attacker generate a linear
signal [14], [26], [27] that is agx + v, in which a is a variable
controlled by attacker, g is attacker’s knowledge about h
(an estimated or correlated version), and v is additive white
Gaussian noise with variance σv. Thus the overall received
signal will be:
y = (h + ag)x + n + v
(1)
W.l.o.g., we use the Rician model for A-B channel (Rayleigh
model is a special case), note that we choose these models
since they are representative and can yield closed-form
solutions. In this model, the channel h is composed of two
6
parts: one is the deterministic LoS component h(cid:48), the other
is the random Gaussian distributed fading component h(cid:48)(cid:48).
Thus the channel is denoted by h = h(cid:48) + h(cid:48)(cid:48).
We assume the attacker could estimate the LoS part
precisely. The estimation g is further divided into two parts
g = g(cid:48) + g(cid:48)(cid:48). The attacker’s strategy consists of a tuple
a = [a(cid:48), a(cid:48)(cid:48), σv] corresponding to each component. Its trans-
mit power can be easily derived based on a, g, the power of
x and v, and here we assume it is not bounded. To include
the attacker’s power in its strategy under power constraint
will be our future work. On the other hand, the defender’s
strategy consists of A’s transmit power.
Under this model, the received signal can be represented
