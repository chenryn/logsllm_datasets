### Title: A Dirty Little History: Bypassing Spectre Hardware Defenses to Leak Kernel Data

The initial disclosure of Spectre in 2018 ushered in an era of transient execution attacks. These attacks typically enable a lower-privileged attacker to leak arbitrary data from higher-privileged security domains by observing the side effects of transiently executed instructions. One particularly potent variant, Branch Target Injection (BTI), exploits mispredictions and subsequent speculative execution on indirect branches to execute attacker-controlled instructions.

Initially, affected vendors relied on a complex set of software defenses to mitigate these attacks. Only in the last two years have they begun to roll out hardware-based defenses to the consumer market.

To evaluate the security implications of these defenses, we developed a tool to automatically test whether a userspace attacker can still cause mispredictions in the kernel, even with these defenses enabled. Our testing confirmed that Branch History Injection (BHI) remains a significant threat to recent systems, including the Google Pixel 6 and devices with 12th generation Intel CPUs.

Moreover, we will demonstrate that this threat is not merely theoretical. We have developed an end-to-end exploit that can leak the contents of `/etc/shadow` in under 10 minutes. During this talk, we will provide a detailed technical walkthrough and live demonstrations of our findings.
