### Satisfying Recovery Requirement R3
The recovery impact of the selected recovery action is optimal or acceptable, meaning its recovery impact is relatively small compared to all other recovery actions. This selection and optimization mechanism ensures that the recovery impact meets the recovery impact objective set by stakeholders. Therefore, the requirement that the recovery should reduce negative impact is achieved.

### D. Recovery Reducing Monetary Cost

#### 1. Experimental Procedure
This recovery requirement concerns the monetary cost incurred on the cloud system during recovery. We measured the recovery monetary cost by performing a rolling upgrade operation on a cloud application. The application consists of 8 instances, which are part of an auto-scaling group (ASG) and registered in an elastic load balancer (ELB). The cloud application running on these instances is TPC-W, a 3-tier web benchmark application running on Tomcat. Each instance has an average workload of 50 query requests per second. For the rolling upgrade, the rolling granularity is 1, meaning one instance is terminated and replaced at a time. We used our proprietary fault injection tool to inject faults at five determined recovery points during the rolling upgrade operation. We automatically determined the applicable recovery patterns based on the filtering method described in Section 7.3 and performed recovery using the selected acceptable recovery action based on two recovery action selection methods. The injected faults are detailed in Table 13 and were chosen based on industry interviews and failure reports, making them representative. The recovery monetary cost was calculated by summing the monetary cost incurred by each step in the recovery action. The experiment was run 30 times to measure the average recovery monetary cost.

#### Table 13: Faults Injected for Rolling Upgrade Operation

| Recovery Point | Fault Injected |
|----------------|----------------|
| 1 (After Step 3) | ASG uses unknown LC |
| 2 (After Step 4) | Instance still registered with ELB |
| 3 (After Step 5) | Instance not terminated |
| 4 (After Step 6) | Instance launching fails |
| 5 (After Step 7) | Instance not registered with ELB |

#### 2. Experimental Results
Table 14 shows the recovery monetary cost for the rolling upgrade operation. The recovery monetary cost represents the average value over 30 runs, with the highest relative standard deviation being 0%. For each recovery point, the monetary cost of the recovery action selected by the Pareto set search-based optimization method is no greater than the other applicable recovery actions. The monetary cost of the selected recovery action by the user constraints-based optimization method is not necessarily less than all others but is within the monetary cost constraint set by business stakeholders.
