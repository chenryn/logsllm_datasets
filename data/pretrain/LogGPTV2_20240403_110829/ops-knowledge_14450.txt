**User:**
My hosting provider says my Python script must be made executable (chmod 755). What does this mean, and how do I do it?
Cheers!

**Assistant:**
When your hosting provider mentions that your Python script should be made executable with `chmod 755`, they are referring to the file permissions on the server. The `chmod` command is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

### Understanding `chmod 755`
- **7** (Owner): Read, write, and execute permissions.
- **5** (Group): Read and execute permissions.
- **5** (Others): Read and execute permissions.

This means the owner of the file can read, write, and execute the script, while the group and others can only read and execute it.

### How to Make Your Script Executable
1. **Using SSH:**
   - Connect to your server via SSH.
   - Navigate to the directory where your Python script is located.
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     chmod 755 your_script.py
     ```
   - Replace `your_script.py` with the actual name of your Python script.

2. **Using an FTP Client:**
   - Most FTP clients provide an option to change file permissions.
   - Upload your Python script to the server.
   - Right-click on the file in the FTP client and select "File Permissions" or "CHMOD."
   - Set the permissions to `755`.

### Additional Notes
- If you are using an FTP client, ensure that the permissions are correctly set after uploading the file, as some FTP clients may not preserve the original permissions.
- It's a good practice to test the script after setting the permissions to ensure it runs as expected.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

Cheers!
