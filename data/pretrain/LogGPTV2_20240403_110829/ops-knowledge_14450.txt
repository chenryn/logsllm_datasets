User: My hosting provider says my python script must be made to be executable(chmod755).  What does this mean & how do I do it?
Cheers!
Assistant: In addition to the other fine answers here, you should be aware that most FTP clients have a chmod command to allow you to set permissions on files at the server. You may not need this if permissions come across properly, but there's a good chance they do not.
