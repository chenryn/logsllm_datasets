**ATT&CK ID:** T1482  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Domain Trust Discovery

Adversaries may attempt to gather information on domain trust relationships in Windows multi-domain or forest environments. This information can be used to identify potential lateral movement opportunities. Domain trusts enable one domain to grant access to its resources based on the authentication procedures of another domain, allowing users from the trusted domain to access resources in the trusting domain.

The information obtained through domain trust discovery can facilitate various attack techniques, such as SID-History Injection, Pass the Ticket, and Kerberoasting. Adversaries can enumerate domain trusts using several methods, including:

- The `DSEnumerateDomainTrusts()` Win32 API call
- .NET methods
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) queries

Additionally, adversaries are known to use the Windows utility `Nltest` to enumerate domain trusts.
