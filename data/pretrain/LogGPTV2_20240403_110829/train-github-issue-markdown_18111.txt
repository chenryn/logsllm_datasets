I have noticed a few instances where this issue arises: According to the HTML5 specification, this is considered an opening tag (previous versions of HTML handled it differently). As a result, it fails silently and effectively "swallows" any subsequent DOM elements. Ideally, the compiler should issue a warning or throw an error in such cases, if possible.
