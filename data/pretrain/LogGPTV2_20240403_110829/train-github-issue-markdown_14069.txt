I'm currently getting the following errors when using @types/node and
@types/requirejs simultaneously:
`ERROR in
C:/xampp/htdocs/webpack_test-1/node_modules/@types/node/module.d.ts(57,14):
TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'mod'. ERROR in
C:/xampp/htdocs/webpack_test-1/node_modules/@types/requirejs/index.d.ts(38,11):
