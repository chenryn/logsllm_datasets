`Ctrl + Click` on a symbol is a shortcut for "Go to definition". I would want
to instead select / highlight the text (same as double clicking), just like in
Visual Studio.
I tried editing the keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn't look like I can use
mouse inputs (`ctrl+click` or `ctrl+mouse1` or `ctrl+mouseleft` didn't work).
Please consider setting this behavior as a built-in setting in settings.json,
or allowing mouse input in keybindings. I realize this might not be very high
priority, but if it's not too complex to implement, it would be a great
quality of life improvement for me!
