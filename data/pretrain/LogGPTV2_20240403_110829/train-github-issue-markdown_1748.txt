##### ISSUE TYPE
  * Bug Report
##### COMPONENT NAME
task executor
##### ANSIBLE VERSION
    ansible 2.2.0.0
      config file = 
      configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
##### CONFIGURATION
tryed with different option on _ssh_args_ (-o ControlPersist=3600s -o
ServerAliveInterval=5)  
tryed with different option on "scp_on_ssh"  
same issue each time  
working with python3
##### OS / ENVIRONMENT
manager: fedora  
managed: debian jessie
##### SUMMARY
Have a complex playbook with many dependencies and many tasks with own
handlers.  
On recursive _template_ and _copy_ tasks with 1-3 items and notified handlers,
tasks with _changed=true_ are very likely too hang : I need to wait Ansible go
to the next step for 10-30 minutes  
while modification is done on the remote system and there is no more remote
Ansible process.  
If I rerun the playbook, change is already done and I don't need to wait â€¦ for
this task. But I lose handler execution.
##### STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Have complex playbook with 30 roles included through dependencies. Some few
times.  
Each one raise at least two handlers. Some handlers can raise other handlers.
##### EXPECTED RESULTS
Same with very higher speed
