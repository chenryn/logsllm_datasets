### Title: Botconf2017 - Use Your Enemies: Tracking Botnets with Bots

Botnets are a fascinating subject for malware researchers. While we continuously work to dismantle them and apprehend the individuals responsible, we also devote significant effort to studying and analyzing their internal mechanisms to better understand how they function. One of the most effective strategies for extracting information from a botnet is to trick it into sending data directly to us.

In this presentation, we will discuss our latest project, which employs this approach. We reverse-engineer the communication protocols used by the botnet, re-implement them in Python, and then impersonate actual bots. This allows us to receive fresh information, malware, spam, and URLs directly from the Command and Control (C&C) servers. We can then process this data automatically and respond appropriately.

We will share our insights from a year of tracking, compare our method with more traditional black-box solutions (highlighting both advantages and disadvantages), and discuss the challenges we faced and the solutions we developed. Although we will not delve deeply into specific malware protocols, we will reference them as part of our discussion.
