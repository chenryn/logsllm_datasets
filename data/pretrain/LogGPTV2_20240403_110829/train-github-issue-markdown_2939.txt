there is a problem in
`Symfony\Component\Form\Extension\HttpFoundation\HttpFoundationRequestHandler`  
lines 38-42
        $method = $form->getConfig()->getMethod();
        if ($method !== $request->getMethod()) {
            return;
        } 
i use the same form and it's creating process for POST, PUT, PATCH. i set the
method in the template like this:
`form_start( form , {'method': 'POST' , 'action': url( 'post_resource' ) })`
when the method is PUT or PATCH (other than the one in form's config, which is
default, ie POST), then the check on line 40 fails with no verbal error.
why is this check&return here anyway? i don't see any point in it.
