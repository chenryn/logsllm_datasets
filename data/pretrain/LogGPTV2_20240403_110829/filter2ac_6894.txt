**Title: Blackhat Asia 2023 - When Knowledge Graph Meets TTPs: Highly Automated and Adaptive Executable TTP Intelligence for Security Evaluation**

In the current landscape of cybersecurity, Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS) solutions are increasingly being adopted for security assessments. However, two significant challenges have emerged:

1. **Timely and Automated TTP Identification:** How to efficiently and automatically capture the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) used by cyberattacks in real-world scenarios.
2. **Adaptive Attack Chain Synthesis:** How to generate attack chains that are tailored to an organization's specific defense-in-depth system, enabling a more accurate evaluation of its defensive capabilities.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel, TTP-oriented knowledge graph-based approach. This method is designed to automate the extraction of TTP intelligence from threat information and to reason about adaptive attack chains for security evaluations. Our solution features two key components:

### 1. Construction of a TTP-Oriented Knowledge Graph
To extract timely TTP entities from unstructured intelligence sources, we employ a distant supervised relation extraction model. This model is built on a deep residual convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism, allowing it to process both English and Chinese information sources effectively.

### 2. Reasoning Capabilities for Adaptive Attack Chains
We have developed the reasoning capabilities of the knowledge graph to synthesize adaptive attack chains. These chains are specifically designed to evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's defense-in-depth system, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement.

By integrating these components, our approach offers a highly automated and adaptive solution for capturing and utilizing TTP intelligence, thereby enhancing the accuracy and relevance of security evaluations.
