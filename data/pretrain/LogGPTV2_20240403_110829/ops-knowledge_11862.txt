User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题What is the PCI requirement for tracking software installation on workstations? We have a task open right now to implement UAC and matching event log tracking for our devs installing software on their machines. I've been asked whether storing/parsing these logs centrally is a requirement for PCI compliance.

I am but an egg. I've flipped through the PCI-DSS 3.1 document, but found nothing definitive. What should I do?

Assistant: I agree with Shane Andrie. Dev machines considered in PCI scope is quite scary. I'd rather look in to moving them out of scope irrespectively of logging requirements.

To answer your question: Yes, storing logs centrally is a PCI requirement. Please refer to requirement 10.5 (excl 10.5.5).

10.5.1 Limit viewing of audit trails to those with a job-related need.
10.5.2 Protect audit trail files from unauthorized modifications.
10.5.3 Promptly back up audit trail files to a centralized log server or media that is difficult to alter.
10.5.4 Write logs for external-facing technologies onto a secure, centralized, internal log server or media device.
