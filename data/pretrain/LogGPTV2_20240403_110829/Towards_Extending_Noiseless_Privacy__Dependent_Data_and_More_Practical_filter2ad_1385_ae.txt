P (X=v) , where |u − v| = 1 and
X ∼ Bin(n, p). Furthermore, we know that u ∈ [np−λ, np+λ]∩
Z. First observe that we get the biggest ratio either for the smallest
or greatest possible u. Moreover, if p (cid:54) 1
2 we get the biggest ratio
for the smallest possible u. Therefore it remains to check these two
cases, calculate ε1 and ε2 and pick ε = max(ε1, ε2).
2 . Then we have X ∼
Bin(n, p). One can easily check that the greatest possible ratio
is for u = (cid:100)np − λ(cid:101) and v = (u − 1). We can bound it in the
following way
Let us begin with the case where p (cid:54) 1
P (X = (cid:100)np − λ(cid:101))
P (X = (cid:100)np − λ(cid:101) − 1)
=
n − (cid:100)np − λ(cid:101)

Ultimately we are interested in the natural logarithm of that ratio.

where the inequality comes from the fact that (1 − 1

for x > 0. See also that 1 − λ
np > 0, because we assumed that
(np − λ) > 0. We also have p > λ
n so all performed derivations
are correct. Note that we picked the biggest possible ratio, so for
p (cid:54) 1
2 it is true for every u ∈ [np − λ, np + λ] ∩ Z that
P (X = u)
P (X = v)
(cid:54) eε1 ⇐⇒ P (X = u) (cid:54) eε1 P (X = v),
where |u − v| = 1. Now let us assume that p > 1
2 . In that case
the greatest possible ratio is for u = (np + λ) and v = (u + 1).
One can easily see, that we can simply consider Bin(n, 1− p) and
apply exactly the same reasoning as before. That leaves us with

In the end we found ε, which has a property that for all
u ∈ [np − λ, np + λ] ∩ Z and |u − v| = 1 it holds that
P (X = u) (cid:54) eεP (X = v),
which concludes the proof of this lemma.
Now we can continue with the proof of our Theorem. Let us
begin with the ﬁrst case, where δ is ﬁxed. One obvious observa-
tion is that M (X) ∼ Bin(n, p). Using Chernoff bounds (see for
example [10]) for binomial distribution we get
P (M (X) (cid:62) np + λ) + P (M (X) (cid:54) np− λ) (cid:54) 2 exp

We want to limit the tail probability by parameter δ, so we want to
ﬁnd a λ such that the right side of this inequality is equal to δ. This
yields

.
Let us denote the set S = {(cid:100)µ−λ(cid:101), . . . ,(cid:98)µ+λ(cid:99)}, which is exactly
the support of M (X) without the tails which probability we just
limited by δ. Now we have to ﬁnd ε such that, apart from the tails,
the following condition is satisﬁed
(cid:18)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)log
(cid:18) P (M (X) ∈ B)
P (M (X(cid:48)) ∈ B)

(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (cid:54) ε
.
∀B⊂S
It is easy to see that instead of checking all subsets of S, we can
check only the single values, because taking a single value with a
bigger ratio yields worst case bound. For that, we can use Lemma 1.
We indeed have M (X) ∼ Bin(n, p). Recall that we assumed
δ (cid:62) P (M (X) = 0) + P (M (X) = n). This means that at least
0 and n are in the tail that we already limited by δ. Therefore,
(np − λ) > 0 and (np + λ)  0. Let α = eε and
1−p . We use similar reasoning as in Lemma 1. First let us
w = p
for u ∈ S and |u − v| (cid:54) 1. Observe that λ

consider p (cid:54) 1
than np, which does not satisfy the following
(cid:54) α.

P (M (X) = k − 1)
