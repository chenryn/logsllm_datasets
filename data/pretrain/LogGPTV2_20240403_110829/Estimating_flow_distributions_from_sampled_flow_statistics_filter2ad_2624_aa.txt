ABSTRACT
Passive trafﬁc measurement increasingly employs sampling at the
packet level. Many high-end routers form ﬂow statistics from a
sampled substream of packets. Sampling is necessary in order to
control the consumption of resources by the measurement opera-
tions. However, knowledge of the statistics of ﬂows in the unsam-
pled stream remains useful, for understanding both characteristics
of source trafﬁc, and consumption of resources in the network.
This paper provide methods that use ﬂow statistics formed from
sampled packet stream to infer the absolute frequencies of lengths
of ﬂows in the unsampled stream. A key part of our work is infer-
ring the numbers and lengths of ﬂows of original trafﬁc that evaded
sampling altogether. We achieve this through statistical inference,
and by exploiting protocol level detail reported in ﬂow records. The
method has applications to detection and characterization of net-
work attacks: we show how to estimate, from sampled ﬂow statis-
tics, the number of compromised hosts that are sending attack traf-
ﬁc past the measurement point. We also investigate the impact on
our results of different implementations of packet sampling.

high end routers form ﬂow statistics from only a sampled substream
of packets in order to limit the consumption of memory and pro-
cessing cycles involved in ﬂow cache lookups. As a side beneﬁt, the
rate at which ﬂow statistics are produced is reduced, in most cases,
lowering the requirement for bandwidth to transmit ﬂow statistics
to a collector, and for processing and storage costs at the collector.
As a second example, reports on individual packets are exported
from a router to a collector. Keeping a record of every packet in the
network is infeasible: packet sampling at the router is necessary to
control usage of processing resources, bandwidth to the collector,
and processing and storage costs at the collector.
Sampling entails an inherent loss of information. For some pur-
poses, loss is easy to correct for. Assuming that 1 in N packets are
selected on average, the total number of packets in the stream can
be estimated by multiplying the number of sampled packets by N.
Assuming sampling decisions to be independent of packet size, the
total number of bytes can be estimated in the same way.
However, more detailed characteristics of the original trafﬁc are
not so easily estimated. Quantities of interest include the number of
packets in the ﬂow—we shall refer to this as the ﬂow length—and
the total bytes that those packets contain. When packet sampling
is employed in routers, the measurements reported are those for
the sampled packet stream rather than the original packet stream.
We call the statistics so formed sampled ﬂow statistics. What rela-
tion do the sampled ﬂow statistics bear to the ﬂow statistics of the
original unsampled packet stream? Some original ﬂows will not be
sampled at all, and longer ﬂows are more likely to be sampled than
shorter ones. Thus simply scaling all sampled ﬂow lengths by N
will not give a good estimate of the number of original ﬂows, or the
distribution of their lengths.
Knowing the number and lengths of the unsampled ﬂows re-
mains useful characterizing trafﬁc and the resources required to
accommodate its demands. Here are some applications:
Resources Required for Collecting Flow Statistics: ﬂow cache uti-
lization and the bandwidth for processing and transmitting ﬂow
statistics are sensitive to the sampling rate, the number of ﬂows,
and ﬂow lengths and duration; see [8, 9].
Characterizing Source Trafﬁc: the measured numbers of ﬂows and
the distribution of their lengths have been used to evaluate gains in
deployment of web proxies [11], and to determine thresholds for
setting up connections in ﬂow-switched networks [12].
Characterizing Network Attacks: in particular, estimating the num-
ber of hosts generating the attack trafﬁc in a set of sampled ﬂow
statistics. This will be an application of our method in Section 8.
Although sampled trafﬁc statistics are increasingly being used
for network measurements, to our knowledge no studies have ad-
dressed the problem of estimating the characteristics of ﬂows in the
original unsampled packet stream—in particular the frequencies
at which different numbers of packets per ﬂow occur—from the
same characteristics of ﬂows constructed from the sampled packet
stream. This is the topic addressed in this paper. For the applica-
tions described above, we envisage packet sampled ﬂow statistics
would be either be constructed directly at routers, or formed at a
collector by aggregation of reports on individual sampled packets
collected by a router that forms no ﬂow statistics itself.
Since sampling picks on average 1 in N packets from an orig-
inal ﬂow, it is tempting to propose the following simple scaling
argument: attribute to each sampled ﬂow of length (cid:2) an original
ﬂow of length N (cid:2). While simple to implement, this approach has a
number of drawbacks. First, it takes no account of ﬂows that have
none of their packets sampled, and so the total number of original
ﬂows is undercounted. Speciﬁcally, the inferred frequencies of the
original ﬂows are biased against (i.e. undercount) shorter ﬂows,
since these are less likely to be sampled. Although it is possible to
compensate any inference against this bias (and we do so later in
the paper) a second drawback remains: the inferred distribution of
ﬂow lengths would be concentrated on integer multiples of N. In
practice, measured ﬂow length distributions are smoother, so some
effective manner of smoothing would be required. This need is par-
ticularly evident for small ﬂow lengths. When N is large, much of
the detail of the original ﬂow length distribution may be at lengths
much shorter than N, the shortest length that would be inferred
from simple scaling. We need to resolve this detail.
With either independent or periodic sampling, ﬂow with lengths
far shorter than N will usually have at most one packet sampled.
Hence it is a challenge to use the information contained in the fre-
quencies of sampled ﬂow lengths to resolve what details one can
of the distribution of original ﬂows shorter than N. Consider the
problem of trying distinguish the following sets of original ﬂows
from their sampled counterparts: (i) 2,000,000 ﬂows of size 1, and
(ii) 1,000,000 original ﬂows of size 2, separately subject to 1 in
N packet sampling. The expected number of sampled packets is
the same in each case. When N is as large as 10,000, the mean
number of sampled ﬂows of size 1 is 200 (to the nearest integer) in
each case, and there is only a 1% chance that case (ii) yields any
sampled ﬂows of length 2. This demonstrates that large differences
in the frequencies of original ﬂows can be difﬁcult to distinguish
on the basis of the frequencies of the sampled ﬂows alone: further
information on the ﬂows is needed to distinguish such cases.
With sampling period N = 100, there is only a 1% difference
between cases (i) and (ii) in the number of sampled ﬂows of size
1, but there are now an appreciable number of sampled ﬂows of
length 2 in case (ii), 100 on average. Any inference method that is
to distinguish the frequencies of short original ﬂows must therefore
estimate each original frequency as a function of a set of sampled
frequencies, rather than simply scaling a single frequency.
We expect knowledge of inferred frequencies to be limited to
smoothed versions. Consider two original ﬂow length distributions
identical except that one is supported on even lengths, the other on
odd, i.e., one of the distributions can be obtained by shifting the
other one place to the right. From the above arguments it is evident
that for sufﬁciently large sampling period, the resulting sampled
ﬂow length distributions will be indistinguishable. Thus, the best
we can hope to do is inferred some smoothed set of frequencies.
1.2 Contribution and Outline
The work of this paper meets these challenges using three ap-
proaches. The ﬁrst formalizes the above scaling argument and
shows in particular how to smooth the distribution so as to more
accurately predict the distributions of ﬂow lengths shorter than N.
The second uses maximum likelihood estimation and associated
techniques to estimate the full distribution of packet and byte lengths.
The third uses protocol level detail commonly reported in ﬂow
statistics (speciﬁcally, TCP ﬂags, when available) to supplement
the ﬂow level information and render the estimators more accurate.
Section 2 describes the sampling model, the use of protocol level
information to supplement sampled ﬂow length statistics, and com-
plexities that arise when multiple measured ﬂows arise from an
original ﬂow. In Section 3 we address another question: to what ex-
tent do the details of the sampling process affect the sampled ﬂow
length distribution, and our ability to infer? Two different imple-
mentations of sampling with the same rate—e.g. periodic and inde-
pendent random sampling—will select different individual packets.
However, we ﬁnd in practice that the distributions of ﬂow lengths
that they produce are quite similar. If the differences are ignorable,
two useful conclusions may be drawn. First, the implementation
details of these two types of packet sampling are relatively unim-
portant as far as ﬂow length distributions are concerned. This helps
foster uniform interpretation of sampled ﬂow lengths across differ-
ent vendor implementations. Second, when modeling the sampling
process in this paper, we are at liberty to chose the implementation
which is most convenient for computational purposes.
In Section 4 we show how protocol level detail in the ﬂows can
be used to resolve detail of the frequencies of small ﬂow lengths
with the scaling based estimator. Section 5 brieﬂy describes a mo-
ment based estimator, which while having bad statistical proper-
ties itself, is useful in understanding our second main method: a
Maximum Likelihood estimator implemented with the Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm, presented in Section 6. Both esti-
mators are evaluated against packet and ﬂow traces in Section 7.
Lastly, the class of inference problems solved here have another
networking application. By letting the variable standing for ﬂow
length instead represent the number of packets produced by a com-
promised host during a certain network attack we can use sampled
ﬂow statistics to infer the total number of compromised hosts that
sent trafﬁc to a network, i.e., including those from which no attack
packets were sampled. This is described in Section 8. We conclude
with some proposals for further work in Section 9.
1.3 Related Work
The work most closely related to this paper is [9], which raised
the idea of inferring properties of original ﬂows, speciﬁcally the
mean ﬂow length, from packet sampled ﬂow statistics. The cur-
rent paper goes much further: we infer the complete distribution of
ﬂow lengths. In this paper, the packet sampling model reﬂects cur-
rent practice: packets are sampled with some average probability p.
Other recent work has proposed a different packet sampling scheme
in order to better capture the statistics of longer ﬂows [10]. Adjust-
ment of the sampling rate in order to meet constraints on estimation
accuracy was proposed in [2]. The work of [5] concerned a differ-
ent problem: the efﬁcient estimation of the distribution of packet
sizes under sampling. Independent and periodic 1 in N sampling,
as well as stratiﬁed sampling out of ﬁnitely many bins, were com-
pared. The problem of estimating the number of distinct classes in
a population from the distribution of class frequencies in a sample
has been considered in [13]. In the current setting, this corresponds
to estimating the total number of original ﬂows. However, these
estimators perform poorly in our application. We investigate the
differences between ﬂow length frequencies arising from random
and periodic sampling. Discrepancy measures for ﬁtting measured
distribution to models have been considered in [5] and [19].
2. FLOWS, SAMPLING & INFORMATION
2.1 The Formation of Flow Statistics
An IP ﬂow is a set of packets, observed in the network within
some time period, that share a common key. An example is the
“raw” ﬂows observed at a router, where the ﬂow key distinguishes
individual source and destination IP address, and TCP/UDP port
numbers. In order to compile ﬂow statistics, the router maintains
a table of records indexed by ﬂow key. A ﬂow is said to be active
at a given time if there exists a record for its key. When a packet
arrives at the router, the router determines if a ﬂow is active for the
packet’s key. If not, it instantiates a new record for the packet’s
key. The statistics for the ﬂow are updated for the packet, typically
including counters for packets and bytes, arrival times of the ﬁrst
and most recent packet of the ﬂow.
Flow statistics can be thought of as summarizing application
level transactions. However, the router does not assume knowl-
edge of application level ﬂow structure, in particular when the ﬂow
has ended. Instead, the router must terminate ﬂows, by criteria that
may include: (i) interpacket timeout: the time since the last packet
observed for the ﬂow exceeds some threshold; (ii) protocol: e.g.,
observation a FIN or RST packet of the Transmission Control Pro-
tocol (TCP) [22]; (iii) memory management: releasing memory for
new ﬂows; (iv) aging: to prevent data staleness, ﬂows are termi-
nated after a given elapsed time since the arrival of the ﬁrst packet
of the ﬂow. When the ﬂow is terminated, its statistics are exported,
and the associated memory is released for use by new ﬂows.
Flow deﬁnition schemes have been developed in research envi-
ronments, see e.g. [1, 4], and are being standardized [16]. Reported
ﬂow statistics typically include the elements of the key, the arrival
times of the ﬁrst and last packets, and the number of packets and
bytes in the ﬂow. Flow statistics are commonly produced using
Cisco’s NetFlow [3]. In Inmon’s sFlow [14], reports on sampled
packets are exported from routers to a collector. Packet sampling
capabilities for routers are currently being standardized [21]. In this
context, aggregation of sampled packet reports into ﬂow statistics
could be performed in the collection system.
2.2 Flow Semantics and Sampling
A good deﬁnition of a ﬂow should encapsulate each application
transaction through the ﬂow summary. However, two factors hin-
der the effectiveness of such encapsulation. First, new applications
may generate packets in patterns that are not well captured by the
ﬂow deﬁnitions. Second, packet sampling removes cues for ﬂow
delineation from the packet stream. The FIN packet marking the
end of a TCP connection may not be sampled. Interpacket timeout
is expected to become the dominant method of termination for TCP
ﬂows when the sampling rate is low. We will use the term original
ﬂow to describe a set of application level packet grouped indepen-
dently of any speciﬁc termination rule used by routers. Once a mea-
surement mechanism has been deﬁned, we can speak of a measured
ﬂow. Either type of ﬂow can be called sampled; for an original ﬂow
this means a substream of packets sampled from it, while a sampled
measured ﬂow means a ﬂow measured from such a substream.
2.3 Dependence on the Sampling Model
Within the functional requirement of sampling packets at a given
rate, a number of different implementations are possible. Imple-
mentations include independent sampling of packets with proba-
bility 1/N, and periodic selection of every Nth packet from the full
packet stream. In both cases we will call N the sampling period,
i.e., the reciprocal of the average sampling rate. To what extent
would the distributions of sampled ﬂow lengths be expected to dif-
fer, and what are the ramiﬁcations for modeling and inference?
Periodic sampling introduces sampling correlations, since fol-
lowing selection of a given packet, none of the N − 1 following
packets are selected. Although this biases against selection of mul-
tiple closely spaced packets, there may not be a large impact when
sampling from high speed links that carry many ﬂows concurrently.
In this case, successive packets of a given ﬂow can be interspersed
by many packets from other ﬂows, effectively randomizing the se-
lection. While such randomization may not be effective at lower
