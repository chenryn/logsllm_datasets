live content was high enough that users were willing to toler-
ate the advertisements. Synd largely delivered non real-time
snippets or highlights that had lower user interest; thus the
advertisements had a higher impact on user attrition.

Implications
We see a clear impact of presentation model on access
patterns, video popularity, and viewing persistence. For ex-
ample, Soc with its unique user engaging method, brings
much faster and much more concentrated access compared
to Oﬀ and Synd . At the same time, Soc also brings ﬂash
crowds of much greater speed and magnitude. With the
rapid growth of online video and social networks, we are al-
ready seeing the convergence these diverse media, and we
expect this convergence to increase in the future. However,
our understanding of how presentation models aﬀect user
behavior and thus aﬀect a VoD system, is quite limited. We
highlight this as a key problem area that deserves further
study.
7. RELATED WORK
Live VoD is still an emerging area. We are not aware of
any extensive measurements of live VoD systems at the scale
we consider in this paper. However, there are several mea-
surement studies of traditional VoD and P2P live streaming
systems, which we discuss below.
VoD systems have attracted many research eﬀorts. One
of the ﬁrst studies is by Griwodz et al., who use oﬀ-line
video rental records to study video popularity [18]. They
also present a request generation model to model time-of-
day eﬀects in user behavior. A number of other studies have
been dedicated to the analysis of user behavior. Almeida
et al. [9] and Costa et al. [16] focus on user behavior in the
context of streaming video servers used by two educational
systems (eTeach and BIBS). The work by Chesire et al. fo-
cuses on session duration, ﬁle popularity, and sharing pat-
terns among clients [15]. Similarly, Chang et al. analyze

in the future. This in contrast to the eﬀects we saw from
our case study of the ﬂash crowd during the 100m ﬁnals.
These measurements involve a user population that is much
more temporally diverse than our dataset. Also, these stud-
ies do not have as much of a “white-box” view as we were
able to provide in our measurements. Thus, they provide
limited measurements on time-of-day eﬀects, ﬂash crowds,
or how video access concentrations change over short time
scales. Gill et al analyze YouTube usage at the University
of Calgary network and observe time-of-day and day-of-week
eﬀects [17].
8. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS
The 2008 Olympics saw a staggering scale of online live
streaming never before seen on the Internet. The real-time,
event-driven nature coupled with the varied presentation
models imposes signiﬁcant new demands on VoD systems.
We presented insights into this large-scale event through
a unique dataset provided by ChinaCache, the largest CDN
in China, which was responsible for serving video content
for the three largest content providers in mainland China.
This dataset provides us with a white-box view of the CDN
servers serving the streaming media content to end-users.
Using this dataset, we were able to understand: (1) how the
live VoD workload diﬀered from traditional VoD and UGC,
(2) how user behaviors were aﬀected by the real-time and
event-driven nature of the event, (3) how the presentation
models impacted video access and viewing patterns, and (4)
case studies of how ﬂash crowds manifest in such systems.
1. The real-time, event-driven nature results in patterns
of user behavior and video access signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from traditional VoD systems. There are clear ﬂash-
crowd eﬀects (caused by both expected and unantici-
pated events), the peak rush hour shows no time-of-day
eﬀects, video durations show more diversity, and video
popularity changes much more dynamically.
2. User viewing times are largely independent of video
durations and users prefer not to exercise DVD/VCR-
like features such as seek or pause.
3. The presentation model aﬀects access patterns signiﬁ-
cantly. A social networking site that actively engaged
users and prompted users brought more concentrated
access to popular videos and ﬂash crowds of high in-
tensity and magnitude.
4. Flash crowds can involve multiple related videos and
earlier videos belonging to the same logical event are
likely to get more concentrated access.
These observations suggest some guidelines for the design
of future live VoD systems:
1. Simpler delivery systems (e.g., using HTTP) need not
compromise user satisfaction. This may explain the
rationale behind why the recent “smooth streaming”
initiative uses HTTP delivery [8].
2. It might be more eﬃcient to cache the ﬁrst few min-
utes of many long videos instead of caching a few long
videos in their entirety.

the user behavior in two media streaming servers run by
Vanderbilt University media service, focusing primarily on
ﬁle popularity, request inter-arrival time, and user viewing
times [12].
Yu et al. give a comprehensive study of user behavior
in a large scale VoD system deployed by China Telecom.
They introduced a modiﬁed Poisson distribution for user
arrival rates and also showed that the video popularity fol-
lowed a Zipf distribution [28]. Huang et al. study long-term
traces from the MSN VoD service and understand the im-
plications of reducing server load via peer-assisted stream-
ing [20]. They present an in-depth analysis of user behaviors
and report results that users do not use interactivity fea-
tures. They also present a theoretical framework to analyze
the performance of peer-assisted VoD. Luo et al. analyze
time-of-day eﬀects, user interactivity, and popularity evolu-
tion using traces from a popular VoD system deployed by
cctv.com, China’s largest television station [23]. They use
these results to evaluate the scalability of P2P approaches
for VoD. Many other works focus on system design and user
behaviors in P2P video streaming (e.g., [10, 13, 19]). There
have been several recent eﬀorts to provide DVD/VCR like
functions (i.e., seek, rewind, pause) in P2P VoD services
(e.g., [26, 27]). Such features might be more relevant in the
context of traditional VoD services; our measurements indi-
cate that users do not exercise these functions in a live VoD
service.
With the advent of YouTube and other similar sites, user-
generated content (UGC) has emerged as a primary driver
for VoD services. Cha et al. provide an extensive mea-
surement study of the user access patterns in YouTube [11].
They show that the popularity distribution exhibits power
law like behaviors but with truncated tails. They also derive
some implications for caching and system design from their
analysis. An interesting observation in their work is that
user preference seems relatively insensitive to a videos’ age.
In contrast, the live, event-driven nature of the Olympics
dataset suggests signiﬁcant churn in popular content. Cheng
et al. [14] present measurements on how UGC systems dif-
fer from traditional VoD system, with a particular emphasis
on the social networking aspects of the deployment, which
they show has signiﬁcant eﬀects. Both these studies show
that if a video did not attract enough requests when it ﬁrst

provision for ﬂash crowds and can defer releasing new
content under overload.
4. Presentation models have signiﬁcant implications for
system design as they may bring more focused access
to a small number of videos or result in ﬂash crowds
with a much smaller time-to-peak. We highlight this
a key problem area that needs further study.
We do however caution system designers to take some
of these observations and implications with a grain of salt.
Olympics-style events present a worst-case scenario for sys-
tem design – it is live, high-proﬁle, event-driven, large-scale,
and spans multiple days. At the same time, this singular
nature also magniﬁes the importance of understanding the
event in detail when the opportunity to study it presents
itself. We were fortunate to have such an opportunity; we
hope that our analysis provide such an understanding.
