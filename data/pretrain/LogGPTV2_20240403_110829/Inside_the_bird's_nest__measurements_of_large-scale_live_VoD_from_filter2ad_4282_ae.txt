### 6.4 Implications

The presentation model has a clear impact on access patterns, video popularity, and viewing persistence. For example, the unique user engagement methods of social platforms (Soc) lead to much faster and more concentrated access compared to traditional (Off) and syndicated (Synd) content. This also results in flash crowds that are both more rapid and of greater magnitude. With the rapid growth of online video and social networks, we are witnessing the convergence of these diverse media, and this trend is expected to increase in the future. However, our understanding of how presentation models affect user behavior and, consequently, VoD systems remains limited. We highlight this as a key area for further research.

Live VoD is an emerging field, and there are no extensive measurements of live VoD systems at the scale considered in this paper. However, several studies have examined traditional VoD and P2P live streaming systems. 

VoD systems have been the subject of numerous research efforts. One of the earliest studies by Griwodz et al. used offline video rental records to study video popularity [18]. They also presented a request generation model to account for time-of-day effects in user behavior. Other studies, such as those by Almeida et al. [9] and Costa et al. [16], focused on user behavior in the context of streaming video servers used in educational systems (eTeach and BIBS). Cheshire et al. [15] analyzed session duration, file popularity, and sharing patterns among clients. Similarly, Chang et al. [12] examined user behavior in two media streaming servers run by Vanderbilt University, focusing on file popularity, request inter-arrival times, and user viewing times.

Gill et al. [17] analyzed YouTube usage at the University of Calgary network and observed time-of-day and day-of-week effects. Yu et al. [28] provided a comprehensive study of user behavior in a large-scale VoD system deployed by China Telecom, introducing a modified Poisson distribution for user arrival rates and showing that video popularity follows a Zipf distribution. Huang et al. [20] studied long-term traces from the MSN VoD service, examining the implications of reducing server load via peer-assisted streaming. They reported that users do not use interactivity features and presented a theoretical framework to analyze the performance of peer-assisted VoD. Luo et al. [23] analyzed time-of-day effects, user interactivity, and popularity evolution using traces from a popular VoD system deployed by CCTV.com, Chinaâ€™s largest television station. They used these results to evaluate the scalability of P2P approaches for VoD.

Recent efforts have focused on providing DVD/VCR-like functions (seek, rewind, pause) in P2P VoD services [26, 27]. These features may be more relevant in traditional VoD services, but our measurements indicate that users do not frequently use these functions in live VoD services.

With the rise of YouTube and similar sites, user-generated content (UGC) has become a primary driver for VoD services. Cha et al. [11] conducted an extensive measurement study of user access patterns on YouTube, showing that the popularity distribution exhibits power-law-like behaviors with truncated tails. They derived implications for caching and system design. Cheng et al. [14] presented measurements on how UGC systems differ from traditional VoD systems, emphasizing the social networking aspects of the deployment, which significantly affect user behavior.

### 8. Summary and Implications

The 2008 Olympics saw an unprecedented scale of online live streaming. The real-time, event-driven nature, combined with varied presentation models, imposed significant new demands on VoD systems. Using a unique dataset provided by ChinaCache, the largest CDN in China, we gained insights into this large-scale event. This dataset provided a white-box view of the CDN servers serving streaming media content to end-users. Our analysis revealed:

1. **User Behavior and Video Access Patterns**: The real-time, event-driven nature of the event resulted in distinct patterns of user behavior and video access, including flash-crowd effects, peak rush hours, and dynamic changes in video popularity.
2. **User Viewing Times**: User viewing times were largely independent of video durations, and users generally did not use interactive features like seek or pause.
3. **Impact of Presentation Models**: The presentation model significantly affected access patterns. Social networking sites that actively engaged users led to more concentrated access to popular videos and flash crowds of high intensity and magnitude.
4. **Flash Crowds and Related Videos**: Flash crowds often involved multiple related videos, with earlier videos in the same logical event receiving more concentrated access.

These observations suggest guidelines for the design of future live VoD systems:
1. Simpler delivery systems (e.g., using HTTP) can still provide satisfactory user experiences, as seen in the "smooth streaming" initiative [8].
2. It might be more efficient to cache the first few minutes of many long videos rather than caching entire long videos.
3. Content providers can leverage related videos to better manage flash crowds and defer releasing new content under overload conditions.
4. Presentation models have significant implications for system design, potentially leading to more focused access to a small number of videos or flash crowds with a much smaller time-to-peak. This is a key problem area that needs further study.

We caution system designers to consider these observations carefully, as Olympic-style events present a worst-case scenario for system design. Such events are live, high-profile, event-driven, large-scale, and span multiple days. Understanding these events in detail is crucial when the opportunity to study them arises. We hope that our analysis provides valuable insights for future research and system design.
