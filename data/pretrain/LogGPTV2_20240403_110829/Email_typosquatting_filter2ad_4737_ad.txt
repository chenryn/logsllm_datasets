### SMTP and Mail Typosquatting

Some typosquatters deliberately target SMTP subdomains (e.g., registering `smtpgmail.com` instead of `smtp.gmail.com`) and webmail domains (e.g., registering `mailgoogle.com` to target `mail.google.com`). Our research identified 41 SMTP and 366 mail typosquatting domains, targeting the top 10,000 .com domains and the top 500 .com domains in the email category on Alexa. Notable examples include `smtpgmail.com`, `smtpoutlook.com`, and `smtplive.com`, which target major email providers. These registrations could be defensive, but their private registration status is inconsistent with typical trademark protection, as defensive registrations usually point to the legitimate owner or their agent.

### Extrapolating from Our Experiments

In this section, we combine our experimental observations and analysis of the typosquatting ecosystem to extrapolate our findings to the broader internet.

#### Toward a Projection

We use a seed of 25 typosquatting domains targeting five popular email services: `gmail.com`, `hotmail.com`, `outlook.com`, `comcast.com`, and `verizon.com`. To project our results, we rely on three hypotheses:

- **H1**: Typing mistakes are equally probable among users of different email providers.
- **H2**: Sending an email is a two-step process: typing the email address and then verifying and potentially correcting any mistakes.
- **H3**: The number of emails sent to a typosquatting domain is proportional to the number of emails sent to the target domain.

Based on these hypotheses, we build a simple model to estimate the expected number of emails sent to a given typo domain:
\[ E_{ij} = E_i \cdot P_{tij} \cdot (1 - P_{cij}) \]
where:
- \( E_i \) is the expected number of emails sent to the target domain over a fixed time period (e.g., a year).
- \( E_{ij} \) is the expected number of emails sent to the typo domain.
- \( P_{tij} \) is the probability of a user typing the typo domain instead of the target domain.
- \( P_{cij} \) is the probability of the user correcting the mistake after typing the typo domain.

To validate this model, we use Alexa's monthly unique visitors to estimate \( E_i \) for email domains, assuming it is proportional to the number of active users. We add three features to incorporate \( P_{cij} \): visual distance, length of the target domain, and position of the mistake, and fat-finger distance.

One limitation is that we could not register domains with deletion or transposition typos. Therefore, we used Alexa's data on typosquatting domains of the 40 most popular target domains to estimate the difference in probability between different typing mistakes. We collected Alexa's data from October 27, 2016, to October 30, 2016.

We removed outlier typosquatting domains receiving unusual traffic, using the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to detect such outliers. We estimated the 95% confidence interval for the mean of different typing mistakes to determine how different their average traffic is.

#### Regression Results

The five target domains—`gmail.com`, `hotmail.com`, `outlook.com`, `comcast.com`, and `verizon.com`—are targeted by 1,211 typosquatting domains (excluding defensive registrations and our own 25 domains).

We built a linear regression model, transforming the dependent variable to square root space. The selected features are:
- The target domain’s Alexa rank (log transformed).
- The square root of our visual distance heuristic, normalized by the length of the original domain.
- The fat-finger distance between the target and the typosquatting domain (zero or one).

The R² value of the fit is 0.74, and the leave-one-out cross-validation R² value drops to 0.63. Our model estimates that the 1,211 typosquatting domains should receive approximately 260,514 emails per year, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 22,577 to 905,174 emails per year. Figure 9 shows that deletion and transposition typos are significantly more frequent than addition and substitution typos. Adjusting for this, our modified regression analysis yields an expected number of emails received by typosquatters equal to 846,219, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 58,460 to 4,039,500.

### In the Shoes of a Typosquatting Victim

To understand the potential threat of email typosquatting, we conducted an experiment where we played the role of a potential victim and deliberately emailed known typosquatting domains with "honey emails." This protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB).

#### Experimental Design

**Honey Email Design:**
- We designed honey emails to signal back to our servers when opened and to include seemingly sensitive information (e.g., login credentials), whose access we can monitor.
- Our emails included a 1x1-pixel tracking image hosted on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). HTML clients might download this image upon opening the email, but this is not always the case.

**Economic Implications:**
- Registering a .com domain costs about USD 8.5 per year. Using this price, a typosquatter can acquire an email for less than two cents (excluding spam).
- From our experience, we could collect non-spam emails for less than a penny each, excluding marginal costs like server and storage.

**Sensitive Information:**
- Manually analyzed emails contained various sensitive information, such as digital receipts, car registration, visa documents, resumes, adult site registrations, and medical records, which could be used for targeted attacks.

**Honey Tokens:**
- We included sensitive information in the form of honey tokens and honey accounts. Honey tokens were file attachments that signaled back upon being opened.
- Our honey accounts consisted of email accounts at two major email providers and a shell account on a VPS we control.

**Sending Emails:**
- We ran two measurement experiments:
  - **Email Probes:** To determine how many typosquatting domains actually accept email, we sent out 152,985 benign emails to 50,995 typosquatting domains.
  - **Honey Tokens:** To determine if emails were read and/or acted upon, we sent honey emails containing sensitive information to 738 domains, followed by a larger test to 7,269 domains.

**Results:**
- 6,099 of our emails were accepted on domains using WHOIS privacy proxy services, with 19 emails read based on our logs.
- Some domains appeared to target potentially sensitive sectors, such as banking, adult sites, and email providers.
