In the `SagaConfigurationLoader.loadConfigurationProperties` method of a distributed transaction saga, the `sagaConfigurationLoader.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(configurationFile)` is used to read the `saga.properties` file. However, when the project is run as a JAR package, this approach may report an incorrect path and fail to locate the file.

To address this issue, you can add a fallback policy. If the initial attempt to read the configuration file fails, you can use `sagaConfigurationLoader.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(configurationFile)` to read the file. This alternative method is more reliable for accessing resources within a JAR package.

Here is the revised text:

"In the `loadConfigurationProperties` method of the `SagaConfigurationLoader` class, which is part of a distributed transaction saga, the method `sagaConfigurationLoader.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(configurationFile)` is used to load the `saga.properties` file. When the project is executed as a JAR package, this approach may return an incorrect path and fail to locate the file.

To handle this, a fallback policy can be implemented. If the initial attempt to read the configuration file fails, the method `sagaConfigurationLoader.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(configurationFile)` should be used instead. This method is more suitable for reading resources from within a JAR package."

This revision clarifies the context, the problem, and the proposed solution, making the text more coherent and professional.
