**Abstract:**
Reachability is considered the most fundamental service provided by today's Internet. However, this does not imply that the community has a deep understanding of it. Researchers and operators rely on two primary views of reachability: control-plane (routing) and data-plane measurements. Both types of measurements suffer from biases and limitations. In this paper, we illustrate some of these biases and show how to design controlled experiments to overcome the limitations of previous measurement techniques. For example, we discover the extent of default routing and its impact on reachability, which explains some unexpected results from studies comparing control- and data-plane measurements.

Not all limitations of visibility given by routing and probing tools can be compensated for by methodological improvements. We demonstrate that certain limitations can be addressed through careful experiment design, such as using dual probing to partly compensate for the inability to see the reverse path taken by a probe. However, other biases may not be fully mitigated by additional measurements. Therefore, calibrating expectations and checking assumptions are critical when conducting measurements aimed at understanding the topological properties of the Internet.

**1. Introduction**
The fundamental service of the Internet is any-to-any connectivity. If a user connects to the Internet at any point, they should be able to reach any other host, though that host may reject the connection. Recent Internet research often focuses on advanced features such as quality of service and mobility. However, this paper highlights that there is still much to learn about the basic reachability service of the Internet.

We believe that our limited knowledge of reachability is due to:
1. The limitations of the data used to assess reachability.
2. A poor understanding of the impact of these limitations on claims about data-plane conditions.

This is an issue for several reasons:
- Observations from the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) only see "best" paths towards originating Autonomous Systems (ASes) and lack broader vision. Increasing the number of BGP vantage points adds less visibility than expected.
- Achieving adequate coverage with active probes requires reaching and getting responses from all over the Internet, especially the edge.
- Current tools like traceroute only provide information about the forward path from the probing site to the destination. Obtaining reverse paths using the record route option and correlating traceroutes is not a general solution.

This paper reports a series of experiments that illustrate the limitations and biases in assessing data-plane reachability from control-plane observations. Our first experiment shows that popular BGP observation points do not provide enough information to assess the reachability of a prefix. Even simple data-plane measurements offer a better view than current BGP observations. Our second experiment reveals that default routing is widely used in the Internet, particularly in stub ASes but also in transit ASes. This prevalence of default routing makes data-plane reachability different from control-plane prefix visibility. The resulting property of "reachability without visibility" is fundamental and would occur even with multiple BGP monitors in every AS. This explains some seemingly anomalous results from previous studies. Our third experiment demonstrates the power of a probing technique called dual probing, which leverages the comparison of probing initiated from different parts of the address space.

Throughout this paper, we highlight why the relationship between the data and control planes is often counter-intuitive and why researchers and operators should carefully consider what their measurements truly indicate. The main conclusion is that the visibility available from both the control plane and popular active measurement techniques is insufficient to make strong claims about the data plane. This does not mean that control-plane and data-plane behaviors are unrelated, but rather that control-plane observations need to be very carefully understood before drawing conclusions about data-plane conditions.

Another theme of this paper is the construction of careful controlled experiments. Each experiment is designed to provide insights into specific network properties. We do not "go fishing" but construct experiments to answer particular questions, sometimes based on previous experimental results. Our goal is to remove ambiguities from our hypotheses. For instance, our initial experiment suggested that reachability extends beyond visibility, leading us to investigate the potential causes of this property. We argue that this approach should be more widely adopted in Internet measurement research. Measurements always have issues, and it is important to continue testing and calibrating.

**2. How Far Does a /25 Propagate?**
Anecdotally, most providers filter prefixes more specific than /24 to limit the number of routes in the global Internet and reduce traffic hijacking. To test whether such filters are as prevalent as commonly assumed, we advertised a /25 prefix from AS 3130 on June 22nd, 2008, ensuring no covering prefix was announced. We then measured its reachability via both control-plane and data-plane measurements. The results were inconsistent, highlighting the key problem that control-plane measurements are insufficient to measure data-plane reachability.

Standard means of predicting reachability involve looking at the control plane via public BGP observation points and private looking glasses. RouteViews and RIPE/RIS route monitors saw the prefix in 11 locations out of 615 RIPE BGP feeds, matching our expectation that a /25 would be severely filtered and not propagate far.

Our data-plane measurements involved pinging a large set of IP addresses spread across the Internet. We used an IP address from the /25 as the source of the ping packets. Receiving a ping response indicates that the target can reach our prefix. No response could mean the host is down or lacks a path to the /25 address space, so we only draw conclusions from positive responses.

Surprisingly, we found 1,024 ASes with usable connectivity back to our /25, representing nearly 5% of all ASes in the Internet at the time. While this is not a significant portion, it is an order of magnitude larger than expected from BGP observations. All BGP observation points that observed the /25 prefix were within 3 AS-hops of the origin. This matched our intuition that most BGP observation points are in the "center" of the Internet. The /25 was not propagated to many observation points, and those that saw the specific prefix were in the center. However, data-plane measurements showed that a much larger proportion of the Internet could reach the address space of the prefix.

Using traceroute, we measured the number of AS hops from the origin of the /25. The results show that the number of hops to the /25 was not much different from the classic number of hops to a broader set of ASes. Comparing BGP observations with data-plane measurements, we see a significant number of ASes 4, 5, or more hops away that could still reach our /25, while the maximum distance of a BGP observation point was 3 AS-hops.

In every respect, the results show a clear difference between control- and data-plane measurements of reachability. Control-plane measurements provide predictions, whereas data-plane measurements show real reachability, so the latter should take precedence. Two likely reasons for the difference are: (i) the prefix propagated further than expected on the control plane to sites not visible from standard BGP monitors, and (ii) default routes provided effective connectivity to some ASes despite not learning of our prefix. Over 75% of ASes with data-plane reachability were stub ASes, suggesting that default routing is more common in stubs, leading us to investigate this further.

**3. Utilization of Default Routing in the Internet**
The previous experiment suggested that default routes may cause discrepancies between control- and data-plane measurements. In this section, we examine the prevalence of default routing in the Internet.

We use AS-path poisoning to measure the extent of default routing. Figure 2 illustrates the process. Our test box in AS 3130 announced a set of experimental prefixes to its upstream tier-1 provider. We announced these prefixes with poisoned AS paths, adding the AS number of the AS we wanted to test. When the AS receives the prefix, it drops it due to BGP loop prevention. This ensures the AS does not install our prefixes in its BGP routing tables. For example, if AS 2 is to be poisoned, we announce "3130 2 3130". When AS 2 receives our prefix, it sees its own AS number in the AS path and drops the announcement. Unless AS 2 has a default route, it should not be able to reach an IP address inside our prefix after receiving the poisoned route.

AS path poisoning tests were conducted from April 18 to May 1, 2009. During this 13-day period, we tested 25,780 ASes for their use of defaults. We used the address space 98.128.0.0/16, sliced into /24s, and announced sub-prefixes in parallel to cover a large proportion of the Internet. We could not probe all known ASes due to difficulties in finding pingable IP addresses and because some operators asked us not to probe their AS.

Each experiment was conducted as follows: we used a look-ahead test from unpoisoned address space to check that the target AS was reachable before poisoning. We then withdrew the test-prefix and waited for 1.5 hours to reduce the possible influence of route caching.
