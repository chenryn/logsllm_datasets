ABSTRACT
Reachability is thought of as the most basic service provided by
today’s Internet. Unfortunately, this does not imply that the com-
munity has a deep understanding of it. Researchers and operators
rely on two views of reachability: control/routing- and data-plane
measurements, but both types of measurements suffer from biases
and limitations. In this paper, we illustrate some of these biases,
and show how to design controlled experiments which allow us to
"see" through the limitations of previous measurement techniques.
For example, we discover the extent of default routing and its im-
pact on reachability. This explains some of the previous unexpected
results from studies that compared control- and data-plane mea-
surements.
However, not all limitations of visibility given by routing and
probing tools can be compensated for by methodological improve-
ments. We will show in this paper, that some of the limitations can
be carefully addressed when designing an experiment, e.g. not see-
ing the reverse path taken by a probe can be partly compensated for
by our methodology, called dual probing. However, compensating
for other biases through more measurements may not always be
possible. Therefore, calibration of expectations and checks of as-
sumptions are critical when conducting measurements that aim at
making conclusions about topological properties of the Internet.

INTRODUCTION
It may be too obvious to mention, but the fundamental service
of the Internet is any-to-any connectivity. If I connect to the Inter-
net at any point, I should be able to reach any other host, though
that host may, of course, reject my advances. Much recent Inter-
net research concerns advanced features of the Internet, quality of
service, mobility, etc. However, we show in this paper that there is
still a great deal to learn about a fundamental reachability service
of the Internet.
We believe that our deﬁcient knowledge of reachability is mainly
due to: 1) limitations of the data often used to assess reachability,
and 2) poor understanding of the impact of those limitations on
claims about data-plane conditions. This is an issue for the fol-
lowing reasons: First, observations made from the Border Gate-
way Protocol (BGP) only see “best”-paths towards the originating
Autonomous Systems (ASes), they have no “broader” vision. In-
creasing the number of BGP vantage points adds less visibility than
one might wish [1]. Second, obtaining adequate coverage with ac-
tive probes requires being able to reach and get responses from all
over the Internet, especially the edge. Third, current tools, such as
traceroute, only yield information about the forward path from the
probing site toward the destination. Obtaining reverse paths using
the record route option and by correlating traceroutes, as in [2], is
not a general solution to the problem.
This paper reports a series of experiments that illustrate the limi-
tations and biases that arise when trying to assess data-plane reach-
ability from control-plane observations. Our ﬁrst experiment shows
that popular BGP observation points do not see enough to assess the
reachability of a preﬁx. Even very simple data-plane measurements
give a much better view than current BGP observations. Our second
experiment shows that default routing is used widely in the Internet,
particular at stub, but also in transit ASes. The unexpected preva-
lence of default routing makes reachability as seen from the data
plane quite different from preﬁx visibility in the control plane. The
resulting property of “reachability without visibility” is fundamen-
tal, and would occur even if we had multiple BGP monitors in every
AS! It has far-reaching implications, e.g., we believe it explains the
seemingly anomalous results from [3], namely the unexpected dif-
ferences between the data- and control-plane measurements. Our
third experiment illustrates the power of a probing technique, dual
probing, that leverages the comparison of probing initiated from
different parts of the address space. Dual probing ﬁrst sends probes
from well established, anchor, address space, and compares it to
the results of probes from a test address space. Using probes from
an anchor address space reduces the chances of misinterpretation
of the measurements made using the test address space. Even this
probing methodology suffers from measurements artifacts and lim-
itations that need to be addressed.
242Throughout this paper, we shed light on why the relationship be-
tween the data and control plane are so often counter-intuitive [3],
and also why researchers and operators should pay more attention
to what their measurements really say. The main conclusion of our
work is that the visibility available both from the control plane and
from popular active measurement techniques is insufﬁcient to make
strong claims about the data plane. We insist on the fundamental
nature of this issue, which questions much previous literature that
made claims about the data plane only from observations of the
control plane. This does not mean that control-plane and data-plane
behaviors are not related, but rather that control-plane observations
need to be very carefully understood before drawing conclusions
about data-plane conditions.
The other theme of this paper is the construction of careful con-
trolled experiments. The nature of these experiments may seem
diverse, because the construction of each experiment is targeted at
providing insights into particular properties of the network. We do
not “go ﬁshing”. We construct experiments where we can answer
particular questions, sometimes as a result of a previous experimen-
tal result. Our goal is to remove the ambiguities from our hypothe-
sis. For instance, our initial experiment suggested that reachability
extended beyond visibility, and so our second experiment was tar-
geted at understanding the potential causes of this property. We
argue that this approach should be more widely adopted in Internet
measurement research. Measurements always have issues, and for
this reason it is important to continue to test and calibrate.
The paper is structured as follows. First, we give an example
of the limitations of BGP observations: we advertise a /25-preﬁx,
which we expected to propagate very poorly and then compare
BGP observations, with active reachability tests (Section 2). The
unexpected reachability of the /25 led us to measure the fraction
of ASes that use default vs the faction of ASes that use default-free
routing, which we report in Section 3. We then use the AS path
poisoning technique to discover hidden upstream providers in Sec-
tion 4. We present in Section 5 a new probing methodology, called
dual probing, that takes advantage of active probing initiated from
different parts of the address space. In the ﬁnal part of the paper,
we discuss three speciﬁc issues of active probing tools, namely the
topological coverage of measurements (Section 6.1), the IP to AS
number mapping (Section 6.2) and the types of probes to be used
(Section 6.3).
2. HOW FAR DOES A /25 PROPAGATE?
Anecdotally, most providers ﬁlter preﬁxes more speciﬁc than
/24 to bound the number of routes in the global Internet and re-
duce grazing of the commons with announcements of overly spe-
ciﬁc preﬁxes to control or hijack trafﬁc.
As the starting point for this paper, we sought to test whether
such ﬁlters are as prevalent as commonly presupposed. On June
22nd 2008, we advertised from AS 3130 a /25 preﬁx making sure
that no covering preﬁx was announced. We then measured its reach-
ability across the Internet via both control-plane and data-plane
measurements. The results were so inconsistent that it highlighted
the key problem of this paper that control-plane measurements are
insufﬁcient to measure data-plane reachability.
The standard means of predicting reachability used by both op-
erators and researchers is to look at the control plane via public
BGP observation points and private looking glasses to see where
the BGP announcement has propagated and what paths are avail-
able. We did the same. RouteViews, and RIPE/RIS route monitors
saw the preﬁx in 11 locations out of 615 RIPE BGP feeds. This
matched our expectation that a /25 would be severely ﬁltered and
would not propagate far.

Figure 1: Distribution of the number of AS-hops to the /25
reachable ASes, to /20 and from BGP monitors.
Our data-plane measurements were based on pinging a large set
of IP addresses spread widely across the Internet (see Section 6.3).
We used an IP address from the /25 as the source of the ping pack-
ets. Receiving a ping-response therefore indicates that the ping tar-
get can reach our preﬁx. No response could mean that the pinged
host might be down, or the pinged host might not have a path to-
wards the /25-address space, and therefore we only draw conclu-
sions from the positive responses.
To our surprise, we found 1,024 ASes that had usable connec-
tivity back to our /25. This represented nearly 5% of all the ASes
in the Internet at the time of the experiment. While this is not a
signiﬁcant portion of the whole Internet, it is still an order of mag-
nitude larger than what we would have expected purely from our
BGP observations.
Even more interesting, all of the BGP observation points which
observed announcements of the /25 preﬁx were within 3 AS-hops
of the origin. Figure 1 shows the distribution (the curve indicated
by “BGP observations /25”, solid line). This matched our intuition
that most BGP observation points are in the “center” of the Inter-
net (near the origin of the /25 preﬁx). The preﬁx was announced
by AS 3130 which has two tier-1 upstream providers. The /25
was not propagated to many observation points, and those which
saw the speciﬁc preﬁx were in the center. However, our data-plane
measurements showed that a much larger proportion of the Internet
could reach the address space of the preﬁx.
Moreover, we used traceroute toward the pingable target IP ad-
dresses to measure the number of AS hops from the origin of the
/25. The results in Figure 1 (curve labelled “out-probes from /25”,
dashed line) show that the number of hops to the /25 was not much
different from the classic number of hops to the broader set of ASes
observed in the study (curve labelled “out-probes from /20”, dash-
dotted line). Comparing the results from the BGP observations with
the data-plane measurements, we see a signiﬁcant number of ASes
4, 5 or more hops away that could still reach our /25, while the
maximum distance of a BGP observation point was 3 AS-hops.
In every respect, the results show a clear difference between
control- and data-plane measurements of reachability. Control-
plane measurements provide predictions of reachability, whereas
data-plane measurements show real reachability, so the latter
need to take precedence.
There are two likely reasons for the difference: (i) the preﬁx
propagated further than expected on the control plane to sites which
were not visible from the standard BGP monitors, and (ii) default
routes provided effective connectivity to some ASes despite the fact
243that they never learned of our preﬁx. Of particular interest, over
75% of those ASes with data-plane reachability were stub ASes,
and as default routing is naively presumed to be more common in
stubs, we sought to investigate this cause further.
3. UTILIZATION OF DEFAULT ROUTING
IN THE INTERNET
The previous experiment suggested that default routes may cause
part of the discrepancy between control- and data-plane measure-
ments. In this section, we examine the prevalence of default routing
in the Internet.
We use AS-path poisoning [4] to measure the extent to which
default routing is used. Figure 2 illustrates the process. Our test box
in AS 3130 announced a set of experimental preﬁxes to its upstream
tier-1 provider. We announced these preﬁxes with poisoned AS
paths, i.e. we announce an AS path in which we artiﬁcially added
the AS number of the AS we want to test. Now the path announced
from our site already contains the test-AS number and when the AS
receives the preﬁx it will drop it due to loop prevention mechanism
in BGP. In that way, we can be sure that this AS does not install
our preﬁxes in its BGP routing tables. For example, if AS 2 is to
be poisoned, we announce "3130 2 3130". When AS 2 receives
our preﬁx, it sees its own AS number in the AS path, and drops
the announcement because of BGP loop prevention. So, unless AS
2 has a default route, it should not be able to reach an IP address
inside our preﬁx after receiving the poisoned route.

AS path poisoning tests were conducted from Saturday, April
18 2009 until Friday, May 1 2009. During that 13 day period, we
tested 25, 780 ASes for their use of defaults. We use the address
space 98.128.0.0/161 sliced into /24’s and announced sub-preﬁxes
1Cautionary note: the techniques used in this paper violate the stan-
dard convention of the AS-path BGP attribute. While this is not a
security, or performance problem [4] it does have consequences for
other AS topology studies. For instance, our approach will lead to
apparently new edges in the AS-graph. Care should be taken in fu-
ture AS-topology studies to remove the preﬁx 98.128.0.0/16 from
data taken during this time period.
in parallel to be able to cover a large proportion of the Internet in
each experiment. We could not probe all known ASes due to the
difﬁculties in ﬁnding pingable IP addresses (see Section 6.3), and
because some operators explicitly asked us not to probe their AS
(which we respect in all cases).
Each experiment was conducted as follows: we use a look-ahead
test (from unpoisoned address space) to check that the target AS
was reachable before poisoning. We then withdraw the test-preﬁx,
and wait for 1.5 hours to reduce the possible inﬂuence of route
