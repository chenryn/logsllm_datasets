It appears that the Dragonfly builder has been broken following a recent change:

- **Change Description**: The commit `8ee90fa` in [CL 16650](https://go-review.googlesource.com/16650) added a test to the `net` package, which allows NaCl's fake network code to listen on the same address twice. This test is failing on Dragonfly.

- **Failure Details**:
  - **Test Name**: `TestListenCloseListen`
  - **Error Message**: 
    ```
    --- FAIL: TestListenCloseListen (0.00s)
        net_test.go:283: failed on try 1/10: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:52085: bind: address already in use

    FAIL
    FAIL    net 4.894s
    ```

- **Additional Failure**:
  - **Test Name**: `TestServerConnState`
  - **Error Message**:
    ```
    --- FAIL: TestServerConnState (1.02s)
        serve_test.go:3041: Unexpected events.

    FAIL    net/http    20.463s
    ```

- **Analysis**:
  - The failure in `TestListenCloseListen` indicates that the `net` package is unable to bind to the same address multiple times, which is expected behavior on most platforms. However, the test is designed to work with NaCl's fake network code, and this discrepancy suggests a platform-specific issue.
  - The failure in `TestServerConnState` suggests that the `net` package, poller, or runtime is processing networking events in a different order on Dragonfly compared to other platforms.

- **Current Limitations**:
  - There is no new-style builder for Dragonfly, making it difficult for developers without access to a Dragonfly system to debug using tools like `gomote` or `trybots`.

- **Next Steps**:
  - A developer with expertise in Dragonfly is needed to investigate and resolve these issues. If you have experience with Dragonfly, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
