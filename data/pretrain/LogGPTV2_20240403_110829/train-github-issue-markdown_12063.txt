I seem to have broken the dragonfly builder after:
syscall: allow nacl's fake network code to Listen twice on the same address  
https://go-review.googlesource.com/16650 (rev `8ee90fa`)
... which added a test to the net package, which dragonfly can't pass.
Failure is:

I see a recent failure:

... which suggests the net package, poller, or runtime are processing
networking events in a different order than all the other platforms.
We also don't have a new-style builder for dragonfly, so people without
dragonfly can't use gomote or trybots to debug.
I think a Dragonfly person needs to help.
