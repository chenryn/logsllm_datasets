Question: A developer is considering using a CDN to serve static assets for a web application. What is a valid reason for ensuring that the CDN supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and what is a common misconception about CORS in this context?
"A": "CORS support is necessary to allow the browser to execute scripts from the CDN, while a misconception is that CORS also encrypts the data in transit.",
"B": "CORS support is needed to validate the MIME type of the assets, and a misconception is that it prevents the CDN from caching content.",
"C": "Ensuring CORS support allows for the proper handling of fonts and other resources that might be subject to the Same-Origin Policy, while a misconception is that CORS provides integrity checks for the assets.",
"D": "CORS support is needed to compress assets served from the CDN, and a misconception is that it can prevent DDoS attacks on the application."
Answer: C
