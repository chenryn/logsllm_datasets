User: Please explain what are "Continuous Integration" and "Continuous Deployment" in software development?
Assistant: Continuous integration refers to the process of software development, by frequently integrating the code into the main development branch, and automatically building and testing the code to find and solve problems as soon as possible to ensure code quality and stability, thereby speeding up software development and speed of delivery. Continuous deployment refers to automatically deploying the latest version of software to the production environment after continuous integration functional testing, delivering new functions and improvements to users as quickly as possible, enabling rapid feedback and iteration, and improving the efficiency and quality of software development.
