Abstract
Millimeter-wave communication with high throughput and high re-
liability is poised to be a gamechanger for V2X and VR applications.
However, mmWave links are notorious for low reliability since they
suffer from frequent outages due to blockage and user mobility.
We build mmReliable, a reliable mmWave system that implements
multi-beamforming and user tracking to handle environmental
vulnerabilities. It creates constructive multi-beam patterns and op-
timizes their angle, phase, and amplitude to maximize the signal
strength at the receiver. Multi-beam links are reliable since they
are resilient to occasional blockages of few constituent beams com-
pared to a single-beam system. We implement mmReliable on a 28
GHz testbed with 400 MHz bandwidth, and a 64 element phased
array supporting 5G NR waveforms. Rigorous indoor and outdoor
experiments demonstrate that mmReliable achieves close to 100%
reliability providing 2.3x improvement in the throughput-reliability
product than single-beam systems.

1 Introduction
5G New Radio (NR) is expected to support cutting-edge applications
such as vehicular (V2X), factory automation, autonomous driving,
and remote surgery [1, 2]. A key requirement for such applications
beyond the high data rate is exceptionally high reliability, defined
as the fraction of time during which the link does not suffer an
outage [3, 4]. As such, 5G NR utilizes millimeter-wave (mmWave,

FR2) frequencies due to abundant bandwidth (400MHz-2GHz) that
can provide the high-data-rate compared to traditional sub-6 GHz
FR1 (20-100MHz bandwidth) bands [5]. However, unlike its sub-6
GHz counterparts, mmWave uses directional beams to reduce the
impact of higher path loss at mmWave frequencies and is highly
susceptible to blockage and user movement. For instance, a mea-
surement study of 28 GHz network deployment in Chicago [6]
shows that blockage by humans always causes link outage, which
is detrimental to applications requiring high-reliability [3].
A large fraction of existing work focuses on improving mmWave
link establishment [7‚Äì11], throughput [12‚Äì15] and coverage [16,
17]; while the link reliability requirement takes the backseat. The
prevailing methods aim to reduce link outages by performing beam-
training, a process where the mmWave base station and client te-
diously scan multiple beams to establish a directional link. Reducing
beam-training time does not prevent outages as the process is usu-
ally reactive [7‚Äì11, 18‚Äì20] and kicks in only after a significant
degradation in link quality. To improve reliability, some authors
propose proactive approaches that constantly track the client using
side-channel information from out-of-band LTE/WiFi [21, 22] or
external sensors like GPS, radar or lidar [23‚Äì26]. These solutions
are not self-reliant, have limited accuracy, and possibly require
sensitive information like user location [24, 25]; making the system
dependant on external information and difficult to deploy with
existing standards. In contrast, we aim to create the ideal mmWave
link: one that can be created and maintained with high reliability
(no link outage), supports high data rates, and is easy to integrate
into current standards.
In this paper, we introduce mmReliable, a system that achieves
both reliable and high-data-rate mmWave links while being proto-
col compliant. Inspired by sub-6 GHz communication, mmReliable
delivers on reliability and throughput by exploiting the multipath
diversity in environmental reflections. These reflections are typi-
cally strong for mmWave and can sustain the link even if the direct
path is occluded or unavailable to establish an independent link.
We observe that conventional single-beam links which utilize the

reflectors are still unreliable because they are prone to outage due to
blockage or misalignment. mmReliable uses single radio frequency
(RF) chain and phased array to create custom beam patterns with
multiple directional beams (multi-beam) that are each aligned to-
wards direct and reflected paths as shown in Fig. 1(b). The idea
here is that the probability of multiple beams simultaneously fac-
ing a blockage is low, reducing the possibility of link outage and
increasing reliability.
An obvious implication of splitting a single beam into a multi-
beam is reduced power radiated per beam to conserve the Total
Radiated Power (TRP) for FCC compliance [27]. The reduction in
per-beam power could reduce the received signal strength and lead
to throughput loss at the receiver, i.e., trading off throughput for
reliability. It turns out we can break this trade-off: we observe that
the received signal is the sum of multiple copies of the transmitted
signal, one from every beam in a multi-beam as shown in Fig. 1(b).
If we ensure constructive addition of these copies at the receiver
(Section 3), the received power and throughput can be increased
to a value higher than that of a single beam while keeping TRP
constant.

Let‚Äôs take an intuitive example of how multi-beam improves
throughput. Consider a mmWave channel consisting of two paths,
and two beams are aligned along those two-channel paths. For
simplicity, assume the path loss is unity for each path, and the
signal traveled along each path incurs the same phase. mmReli-
able‚Äôs transmitter splits the total power of ùëé2 equally into two
beams with power ùëé2

beam, which propagates through the channel and is received at the
Omni-receiver. Since the phase align for both paths, the received
signal adds in signal domain, i.e. total amplitude of the received
signal ùëé‚àö

SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) is proportional to 2ùëé2. In contrast, a
traditional mmWave single-beam link does not exploit the second
path and would provide an SNR proportional to ùëé2, which is 3
dB lower compared to the multi-beam case. Higher SNR results
in lower bit error rates and allows higher modulation and coding
schemes, leading to higher throughput for multi-beam. In Section 3,
we go beyond this simple example to consider practical channels
and show that, if the beam directions, phase, and power per beam
of multi-beam are chosen optimally, then multi-beam will always
achieve SNR higher than single beam even in wireless channels with
weak multipath, while using the exact total radiated power. A multi-
beam created using optimal parameters is hereafter referred to as
constructive multi-beam.
As a first, we develop an algorithm to establish a constructive
multi-beam link with low-overhead and protocol compliance. To
achieve constructive multi-beam, one needs to estimate the optimal
beam directions, beam-phase, and power per beam. Our key insight
here is to decouple this problem into two: finding beam directions
and estimating the per beam power and phase. mmReliable first
learns the directions of strong paths in the environment (i.e., paths
viable for communication) during the mandatory beam-training
phase. This could be done using exhaustive beam-scanning or any
other improved algorithm [7, 8, 28, 29]. Then, with just two addi-
tional channel probes per viable beam, it learns the optimal power
and phase to be applied to each beam in the multi-beam. Only

two-to-three viable beams exist in typical environments due to the
sparse nature of reflection clusters at mmWave [18, 30]; therefore,
mmReliable‚Äôs algorithmic overhead remain fixed and independent
of the number of elements in the antenna array.
Once the constructive multi-beam is established, the challenge is
in continuously maintaining it, as the wireless channel changes due
to blockages and mobility. Link blockages could completely occlude
one or more beams of a multi-beam. Mobility adversely affects the
established links by causing misalignment between transmit and
receive beams, degrading both throughput and reliability. Multi-
beam management design has to address some uniquely challenging
aspects. In contrast to a single-beam system where only one beam
is misaligned, in a multi-beam system, all the beams get misaligned
simultaneously due to mobility. In addition, using a phased array
system with a single RF chain means that signals from multiple
beam-directions are always superposed into one. The superposition
makes it difficult to assess the effects of blockage and misalignment.
We develop a beam-maintenance algorithm, which proactively
re-aligns each of the beam parameters (direction, phase, and ampli-
tude) in a multi-beam and continuously maintains its constructive
nature. First, mmReliable uses a super-resolution algorithm to tease
apart the properties of individual beams from their sum. Next, it uses
the estimated per beam properties to measure power loss and infer
the underlying cause, i.e., blockage or mobility. Instead of waiting
for beams to degrade, mmReliable proactively makes this inference
and optimizes per-beam properties, and maintains constructive
multi-beam. mmReliable uses low-overhead standard-compliant
channel probes that are embedded in the communication waveform
to achieve the elusive goal of creating and maintaining reliable high
throughput mmWave links, free from sporadic outages.
We build a first-of-its-kind software-defined 5G NR testbed on 28
GHz mmWave bands with 64 elements phased array that supports
channels of up to 400 MHz [31]. We implement mmReliable using
5G NR compliant reference signals. We perform experiments at
28 GHz in our university area by deploying mmReliable in vari-
ous indoor and outdoor scenarios with link distances of up to 80
m. Through empirical measurements, we find that indoor walls
and large outdoor buildings are powerful reflectors; the median
attenuation of the reflected path with respect to the direct path in
outdoor scenarios is only 5 dB. Our evaluation shows that in scenar-
ios where user movement and blockage co-occur, mmReliable has
reliability close to 100% while maintaining an average throughput
of 1.5 bits/sec/Hz as compared to the single-beam reactive baseline,
which has a reliability of 65% and on-average throughput of 1 bit-
s/sec/Hz. The throughput-reliability product is improved by 2.3√ó
compared to the best reactive baseline. The artifacts for mmReliable
are available online1.
2 Background and Motivation
Directional beamforming in mmWave creates the need for beam-
management schemes for link creation and maintenance. Beam-
management can be divided into two broad functions: the first is
beam-training, and involves the search and creation of a beam [7‚Äì
11, 18‚Äì20]. The second is beam-maintenance and involves the
upkeep of the beam despite environmental factors such as blockages,
mobility, and fading. Even if multi-beam is resilient to blockages, it

is not practical unless it can be efficiently created and maintained
under the constraints of existing standards. The efficacy of the
beam-maintenance function is especially critical to enabling reliable
mmWave links with low overhead. Protocols such as 5G-NR and
IEEE 802.11ad contain exclusive signaling and control provisions
for such beam-management [1, 32, 33].
2.1 mmReliable: Making Multi-beam Practical
While single-beams have been the default choice for communica-
tion, there are some recent interest in using multi-beams to enable
auxiliary mmWave capabilities. Multi-beams have been shown to
aid with the beam-training process [11, 34‚Äì36]. In [11], the authors
employ multi-beams for fast beam-training, but use them to set
up single-beam links for communication. In [34], the authors pro-
pose a beam-training method to create multi-beams for blockage
resilience. However, they do not derive or discuss that a multi-beam
link is better than a single-beam link for throughput. In addition,
all of [11, 34‚Äì36] depend on repeated reactive beam-training to
re-establish the link when it is blocked or misaligned, leading to in-
termittent outages. In contrast, we propose multi-beam as the new
