and third parties (e.g. Data brokers). There are differences in
targeting strategies across countries: more users are targeted
with PII-based and Data brokers in the U.S. than Europe
and the rest of the world. Finally, advertisers from speciﬁc
industries like Business and Finance use such invasive and
opaque strategies signiﬁcantly more frequently.
B. Analysis of targeting attributes
We now study the precise attributes advertisers use to create
their targeting audiences, and the different ways advertisers
are using them. There are four types of attributes according
to the Facebook Advertiser API: Interest (I), Behaviors (B),
Demographics (D) and Proﬁle data (PD). We analyze data on
12K advertisers which have targeted 111 users with 38K ads
that have used 2,552 attributes (14K; 499; 55K; and 4,239 for
DATA-BRAZIL, respectively).
Impact of biases and limitations in the dataset: We collect
the attributes present
in the ad explanations provided by
Facebook. Andreou et al. [22] showed that if the advertiser
uses multiple attributes to create his targeting audiences, only
the attribute with the highest audience size will appear in the
explanation. Thus all the results in the section are likely to
be biased towards the popular attributes advertisers choose (as
those will be shown if the advertisers use multiple attributes).
Additionally, possible biases of the population of our datasets
might be reﬂected on speciﬁc attributes.

were used by the largest fraction of advertisers (middle), and
were seen by the largest number of users in their ad explana-
tions (bottom) out of those considered in Section V-B. We can
see that most attributes are either languages, or broad Interests
such as Travel and Entertainment. Regarding the least used
attributes, 38% of them appear in only one ad (Table XIII
presents a sample); 49% have been used by only one advertiser;
and 64% have been seen by only one user (36%; 49%; and
48% for DATA-BRAZIL). Such attributes typically appear more
speciﬁc (e.g. interests like Artisan, Modernism, or proﬁle data
that point to speciﬁc universities) than the most frequently
used attributes, revealing characteristics of users that might
make them more unique. Furthermore, the sparse occurrences
of these individual attributes highlights the fact that unless
users look at ad explanations constantly, they are going be
oblivious of most of the attributes used to target them.
Predeﬁned vs free-text interests: As mentioned in Sec-
tion II-A, Interests can either be predeﬁned or free-text. In our
dataset, a surprising fraction of ads (39%) was targeted using
free-text interests while 61% targeted using predeﬁned ones
(47%; 53% for DATA-BRAZIL). The percentage of free-text
interests is likely underestimated given they have generally a
smaller audience sizes than predeﬁned ones with a median of
203M users for predeﬁned, and 17M for free-text that were
used for targeting in our dataset. It is worth noting that free-
text attributes can be used as a proxy to discriminate against
people [38] and can also be more sensitive.
2) Consistency of attributes being used by advertisers: We
now take a deeper look at how consistent are the attributes that
advertisers use both individually, and within their respective
IAB category.
Individual advertisers’ attributes: While we cannot
always know all the attributes advertisers use for the same
ad campaign (due to the limitations of ad explanations),
we can check whether multiple attributes appear in multiple
campaigns of an advertiser. In our dataset 24% of advertisers
have used more than one attribute across all their observed ad
campaigns with some targeting even more than 15 different
attributes. Table XIV shows the advertisers that have used
the largest number of attributes in both datasets, including
Google with 94, and Udemy with 105 attributes. While many
of the attributes used seem relevant to the business scope of
the respective advertiser, some of them are more questionable.
For example, Google has used attributes such as Married,
Family, Women’s rights, Politics and social issues and US

politics (very liberal) to target users. Similarly Udemy has
used attributes such as Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh
which might reﬂect speciﬁc religious groups and political
world-views. We will investigate in the next section how the
ads of advertisers vary with the targeting attributes they use.
IAB categories’ attributes: Advertisers that belong to
the same IAB category, intuitively might have some consensus
on the attributes they use, which would reﬂect the category they
belong to. We use Krippendorff’s α reliability coefﬁcient [32]
to measure the amount of agreement between advertisers that
belong to the same IAB category. Values for α typically range
between 0 and 1, with α = 1 implying perfect consensus
among the attributes that advertisers in a category are using and
α = 0 implying that the attributes each advertiser is using are
not statistically related. Table XV shows the α (normalized) of
advertisers in the top 10 IAB as well as sensitive categories.
We normalize the values by dividing by the the highest α
in our datasets which corresponds to the Pets category (0.17
for DATA-WORLDWIDE; 0.20 for DATA-BRAZIL). We see the
highest consensus between advertisers in Travel and Style &
Fashion with 59.8% and 32.4% respectively (37.1%; 21.6%
for DATA-BRAZIL). In fact, out of the 632 Travel advertisers,
37% has used the interest Travel and 10% the interest All
frequent travelers.
Regarding more sensitive categories, we see that most of
them have in general lower consensus. The most common
attribute out of the 591 attributes that News and Politics

advertisers have used, is English-Proﬁle data (11% of ad-
vertisers), and the rest of attributes come from a very wide
range of topics, such as political like Social Democratic Party
of Germany and Anti-fascism, philosophical like Friedrich
Nietzsche, or sexual orientation like LGBT community.
3) Takeaways: A large fraction of attributes used in tar-
geting are free-text ones; free-text attributes are often more
niche and potentially more sensitive. Additionally, a signiﬁcant
fraction of advertisers use multiple attributes to target users,
going to as many as 105 attributes across campaigns. While in
most cases the targeting attributes are in accordance with the
business of the advertiser, we do ﬁnd cases of questionable
targeting even from big companies. Our ﬁndings emphasize
the need for mechanisms that can provide more visibility and
accountability in what type of users do advertisers target.
C. Analysis of targeted ads
Advertisers often tweak the content of their ads in order to
get better engagement from users. In this section, we analyze
how advertisers change their ads across three dimensions:
(1) over time for the same user, (2) across users, and (3)
across targeting attributes. These practices are not necessarily
malicious, and frequently they might be the result of benign
practices such as running several ads to different users to see
how they perform. However, the tailoring of ad content may
raise concerns in certain contexts such as political advertising;
if left unobserved, highly targeted ad messages could become
a tool for manipulation. For the remainder of this section, we
focus on front ads only, as we observed that the content of
front ads and side ads often differs for the same advertiser
due to the different formats, and we do not wish to consider
such differences as changes to the ads themselves.
1) Ads that change over time for the same user: To measure
the percentage of advertisers change the content of their ads
over time for a speciﬁc user, we look at user–advertisers pairs.
Out of the 34K user-advertisers pairs we observe in our dataset,
in 34% of them the advertiser sent two or more ads to a user;
we consider this set in this analysis.
To identify advertisers that change the content of their ads,
we count the number of ads with different texts for each user-

advertiser. Figure 3a shows the cumulative distribution of the
number of ads with different texts for each user-advertiser pair.
The ﬁgure shows that 86% of user–advertiser pairs have two
or more ads with different texts (and this corresponds to 86%
of the advertisers we consider). Furthermore, 5.5% of user-
advertiser pairs have more than 10 different ad texts. This result
suggests that advertisers are showing users a variety of ads,
rather than a single ad repeatedly.
To study the properties of advertisers that change their text
frequently, we need to normalize the number of texts in each
user–advertiser pair by the number of days in which we have
collected ads for the user (as some users provided data for
longer periods than others). To do so, we examine advertisers
corresponding to the top 10% of user–advertisers pairs with
most text changes in their ads (normalized). This corresponds
to 768 advertisers that have targeted 99 users (1,203 and
461, respectively, for DATA-BRAZIL). Table XVI shows the
most frequent IAB categories of these advertisers in the Time
column. For example, we observe that over 13% of Style &
Fashion advertisers sent different texts to at least one user, and
that 10.9% of advertisers in the potentially sensitive category
of News and Politics category did the same.
To provide examples of how these advertisers are changing
the content of their ads, the ﬁrst two rows of Table XVII
presents a sample of advertisers and the text of their ads from
News and Politics. There, we see an example from the The
New York Times where ads are tailored to reﬂect different
news articles, and an example of a politician whose ads are
tailored to political messages to relate to her political agenda.
2) Ads that change over users: To analyze the advertisers
that change the content of their ads across users, we focus
on two subsets of advertisers: (1) all-disjoint, representing
advertisers where each user has been targeted with a different
ad (i.e., there is no overlap in the ads received by any of
the users); and (2) one-disjoint representing advertisers where
there exists at least one user that received ads that are different
than the rest of the users targeted by the advertiser (i.e. there
exists a user with an empty overlap between his ads and the
ads received by the rest of the users).
We consider that two ads are different if the text that
appears is different. To account for the fact that the text that
appears in two ads is different just because it is in two different
languages, we only consider ads that are in English. We also
repeat the analysis for only ads that are in Portuguese (from
DATA-BRAZIL), French and German. In order to detect the
