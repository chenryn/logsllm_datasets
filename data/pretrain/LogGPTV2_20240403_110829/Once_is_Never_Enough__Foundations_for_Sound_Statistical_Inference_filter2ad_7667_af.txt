Appendix
A Ontology of Tor Performance Metrics
In this appendix, we describe an ontology of the Tor network,
from the perspective and for the purpose of controlled per-
formance research. While our ontology shows one way of
orienting known factors to consider when conducting Tor
experiments, we emphasize that it is not intended to be com-
plete. The most interesting future research may come not from
the measurement of properties (or even elements) listed here,
but from the gaps and undervalued areas that are currently
unexplored in Tor research.
Ontology: The ontology consists of elements (clients, relays,
servers, and the network), each of which have properties that
can be further recursively subdivided into (sub)properties.
These properties can be viewed as the variables of an ex-
periment, and therefore can be separated into independent
and dependent variables. Independent variables are properties
that are set, chosen during the course of experiment conﬁg-
uration (e.g., the number of clients, or available bandwidth).
Dependent variables are properties that can be measured as
results of the experiment (e.g., throughput, or successful down-
loads). The division between what constitutes independent
and dependent variables depends on the speciﬁc context of an
experiment. In this ontology, we classiﬁed properties based
on the experimentation platforms we examined. Speciﬁcally,
