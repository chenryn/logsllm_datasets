Fig. 7. Equivalent results for HEAnet ftp server (log scale), April and May 2007
breakdown of addresses observed from each of these sources. Note that the results are
quite consistent with each other, but show differences when compared to Fig. 6 and
Fig. 7. In particular, almost all addresses seen are global IPv6 addresses and most host
IDs are either low or IPv4-based. Some “autoconf” addresses are observed, however
this is a misnomer in the case of routers, as routers can use EUI-64 based addressing, but
do not assign their own addresses based on IPv6 autoconﬁguration. Again, no addresses
generated from the VRRP MAC address were observed.
There is an absence of Teredo and ISATAP addresses, and 6to4 addressing is un-
common except where the probes are sent from a 6to4 source address. If the probe is
sent from a 6to4 address, source address selection should cause the router to choose a
6to4 address for the response, if it has one. When compared to the results in Fig. 6 and
Fig. 7 we see a more even distribution across all 5 RIRs, representing the indiscrimi-
nately global nature of the traceroute. There is still some systematic bias in favour of
RIPE as all the source nodes were located in Europe, but this dataset shows the most
even geographic distribution of addresses. Otherwise, both the ftp and DNS server see
a broader spread of address types than traceroute does.

Fig. 8. Results for traceroute6 from Commercial ISP, HEAnet and 6to4, September 2007
5 Conclusion
We have presented a technique for analysing aspects of IPv6 addresses. We applied
this technique to three different datasets. The results produced have shown consistency
from month to month, suggesting that the technique should be stable enough to identify
trends in IPv6 deployment. From the traceroute data we also see that the results are
consistent across different networks. Comparing results between datasets, the technique
30
D. Malone
quantiﬁes differences we expect based on the operation of IPv6 networks. These results
build conﬁdence that the technique produces meaningful results.
The results are consistent with what we expect of the IPv6 Internet, but we have not
explicitly veriﬁed the accuracy of our technique. It would be interesting to do this by
analysing data from known IPv6 networks. Accuracy might be improved accounting for
the times addresses are observed and spatially/temporally adjacent addresses.
As further work, we would like to look at how subnets are being allocated within
organisations and provide a more detailed study of host IDs, including tracing them
and linking them with manufacturers. We would also like to explore applications of this
technique to log analysis and adaption of service delivery/content.
