### Steps to Reproduce
1. I have a dimension that contains `NULL` values. This means not all rows have a value.
2. Use this dimension as the "Group By" field.
3. Execute the query.

### Additional Information
I added a filter to the form. The filter uses the same dimension, `event_name`, with the relation set to `!=`. However, I did not input any value for the filter. After adding this filter, I was able to see the expected results.

I suspect the issue is that the system defaults to filling `NULL` values with `0`, but my dimension is of type `TEXT`. This leads to an error: `unorderable types: str() > int()`.

This issue is similar to #3029.
