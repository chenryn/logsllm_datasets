### Steps to reproduce
  1. I have a dimension have 'NULL'. What I mean is not all row have value.
  2. Use this dimension as Group By.
  3. Query.
### More
I add a Filters into this form. The Filters is same dimension is 'event_name',
relation is '!=', **but the value I did not input anything.**
Then, I can see the expected results.
I guess the reason is that default fill 0 into NULL, but my dimension is TEXT.
Then occur `unorderable types: str() > int()`.
And this is similar issue.
