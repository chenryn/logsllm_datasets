##### Description of the problem
There seems to be a bug when copying from a buffer geometry into another
existing buffer geometry, which causes groups to be appended, instead of
replaced.  
I don't think this is working as intended.  
Problematic code
I think this needs a clearGroups() call before starting to add groups.
