### First check
  * I added a very descriptive title to this issue.
  * I used the GitHub search to find a similar issue and didn't find it.
  * I searched the FastAPI documentation, with the integrated search.
  * I already searched in Google "How to X in FastAPI" and didn't find any information.
  * I already read and followed all the tutorial in the docs and didn't find an answer.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Pydantic.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to Swagger UI.
  * I already checked if it is not related to FastAPI but to ReDoc.
  * After submitting this, I commit to: 
    * Read open issues with questions until I find 2 issues where I can help someone and add a comment to help there.
    * Or, I already hit the "watch" button in this repository to receive notifications and I commit to help at least 2 people that ask questions in the future.
    * Implement a Pull Request for a confirmed bug.
### Description
  * FastAPI's docs, while very good, do not have a reference view to the internal API. What are the arguments that a Response object takes? What are the arguments that a Query object takes? etc. A standard, autogenerated reference doc is needed! Now that I have a basic understanding of the things this framework can do, 90% of my questions can be answered by an online reference.
### The solution you would like
Autogenerate reference docs and publish them with the rest of the docs, linked
from the docs page.
One of this project's primary focuses is document generation for framework
users. Seems like it should put that philosophy into practice for itself.
### Describe alternatives you've considered
  * Build my own documentation for this framework?
  * Search the source code? (what I've resorted to doing most of the time)
