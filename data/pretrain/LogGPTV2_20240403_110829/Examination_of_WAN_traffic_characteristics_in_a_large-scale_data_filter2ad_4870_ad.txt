value of mi is the traffic volume of the i-th service in the j-th 10-
minute interval. Given the skewed WAN traffic distribution among
services, we consider only the top 20% of services (i.e., the top 144
services, n = 144 ). That said, M is a 144 × 144 matrix.
We analyze the temporal correlation among services by applying
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the matrix. The goal
of SVD is to find the effective rank-k approximation to M. If k ≪
min(n, l), then we say M has low rank. Low rank is important
because it means that elements of M are related; only a small amount
of information is needed to construct M, so some elements of M
can be computed as linear combination of other elements. Likewise,
if a matrix has low rank, then some elements can be approximated
as linear functions of other elements [12]. To find k, we need to use
the error distance of reconstructing the columns of M using these
k vectors. The error distance is defined as the Frobenius norm of
M − M(k), denoted as ∥M − M(k)∥F =
i =k +1 σ 2
i , where σi is the
diagonal value in the Singular value matrix Σr×r .

Figure 11 shows the variation of the relative F-norm error when
varying k. We can see that for both the total and the high-priority
traffic, using the top 6 strongest features to describe the whole
temporal traffic patterns can reach less than 5% relative error. In
other words, the matrix has a low rank of 6. With such a low rank,
we can measure a few elements in M to infer other elements. The
low rank also implies a limited number of WAN traffic variation
patterns across services.
5.2 Service-level Traffic Predictability
Traffic stability analysis. In Section 4, we study the predictabil-
ity of overall traffic exchanged between heavy DCs. When run-
ning various commercial services, providers (like Baidu) may apply
service-level traffic engineering to offer different levels of service-
level objectives, as suggested in [7]. To this end, we need to examine
the predictability of high-priority inter-DC traffic for different ser-
vices. Figure 12(a) plots the distribution of the fraction of total traffic
contributed by the DC-pairs experiencing less than 10% of traffic
change on a 1-minute time scale. The stability indeed varies greatly
across services. First, the Web, Cloud and DB services exhibit a
very good stability for most fraction of inter-DC traffic: for over
80% of 1-minute intervals, 90% of traffic remains stable. Due to the
large fraction of self-interactive traffic of these three services (see
Table 3), the traffic stability is mainly determined by their inherent
traffic characteristics, leading to a higher stability. In contrast, the
Computing service exhibits less stable with under 60% of traffic
remaining stable for over 80% of 1-minute intervals. As Comput-
ing has wide range of interactions with many other services (see
Table 3), its stability is affected by the diverse usage of other ser-
vices. Second, we see AI and Analytics, which constitute the new
foundations for other services, exhibit less predictability than those
of traditional Web services, urging the need of fine-grained WAN
traffic engineering. At last, Map and Security services are least
stable, possibly because of their unpredictable usage patterns and
the relatively low traffic volume.
Figure 12(b) further shows the run-length of stability. The Web
services has the longest run-length: as many as 70% of the DC
pairs remain predictable for over 5 minutes. Given that the web
search services are still the major services of Baidu and contribute
the most of traffic, the good stability of their high-priority traffic
means a high accuracy of traffic prediction and better performance
guarantee. The run-length for the FileSystem and Map services is
much shorter: only about 20% of the DC pairs remain predictable for
over 5 minutes. Given that the high-priority traffic of Map services
is more likely to cross DC boundary (see Table 2), special cares
should be taken when traffic engineering for this type of services.
We also observe that although the high-priority traffic of Cloud
services is quite stable for the most fraction of inter-DC traffic (see
Figure 12(a)), its stability cannot persist for a long time.
