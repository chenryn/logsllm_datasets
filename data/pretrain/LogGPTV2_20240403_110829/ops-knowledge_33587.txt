User: What are common processing architectural patterns for large-scale data processing tasks?
Assistant: Common data processing architecture modes are: 1. Batch mode: read a large amount of data into the memory at one time, perform a series of operations and write the results back to the storage medium, suitable for non-real-time, high-throughput data processing tasks. 2. Stream processing mode: stream data passes through multiple continuous computing operations, and the results are processed and output immediately after the data arrives. It is suitable for data processing tasks that require real-time response and continuous operation. 3. Event-driven mode: Trigger specific computing operations by processing input events, usually implemented by stream processing mode. 4. Batch-stream combination mode: Combine batch processing and stream processing, process more real-time data through stream computing, and then perform batch processing periodically, which is suitable for data processing tasks that require fast response and periodic processing. 5. Lambda architecture: Combine batch processing and stream processing, use faster stream processing to generate real-time query views, use batch processing to generate offline views, and combine the two views to return query results on demand, which is suitable for real-time responses and data processing tasks for fast offline processing.
