Question: Why is a basic variant of RSA encryption, which is deterministic, not considered IND-CPA secure?
"A": "Because it does not use a symmetric key for encryption.",
"B": "Because deterministic encryption allows for patterns to be discerned when the same message is encrypted multiple times.",
"C": "Because it relies on factorizing large primes which is computationally easy.",
"D": "Because it encrypts both the message and the random key, making it susceptible to attacks."
Answer: B
