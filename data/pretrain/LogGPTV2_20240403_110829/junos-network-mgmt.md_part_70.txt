### Adaptive Sampling Overview

Adaptive sampling is a process that monitors the overall incoming traffic rate on a network device and provides intelligent feedback to interfaces. This feedback allows the interfaces to dynamically adjust their sampling rates based on current traffic conditions. The primary goal of adaptive sampling is to prevent CPU overload and maintain the system at an optimal level, even when traffic patterns change.

- **Sample Rate**: The configured number of egress or ingress packets from which one packet is sampled.
- **Adaptive Sample Rate**: The maximum number of samples that should be generated per line card, serving as the limit for adaptive sampling.
- **Sample Load**: The amount of data (or number of packets) moving across a network at a given point in time that is sampled.

As the sample rate increases, the sample load decreases, and vice versa. For example, if the configured sample rate is 2 (meaning 1 out of every 2 packets is sampled), and this rate is doubled to 4, only 1 out of every 4 packets will be sampled.

The adaptive sample rate is configured at the `[edit protocols sflow adaptive-sample-rate]` hierarchy level.

### How Adaptive Sampling Works

QFX Series devices use adaptive sFlow sampling to ensure sampling accuracy and efficiency. The sFlow agent monitors the overall incoming traffic rate and provides feedback to the interfaces every 5 seconds. It identifies the five interfaces with the highest number of samples. On a standalone switch, if the CPU processing limit is reached, a binary backoff algorithm is implemented to reduce the sampling load of the top five interfaces by half.

Adaptive sampling prevents CPU overloading and maintains the device's optimal operation even when traffic patterns change. The reduced sampling load remains in effect until:
- The device is rebooted.
- A new sampling rate is configured.
- The adaptive sampling fallback feature, if enabled, increases the sampling load because the number of samples generated is less than the configured threshold.

If a particular interface is not configured, the IP address of the next interface in the priority list is used for the agent. Once an IP address is assigned to the agent, the agent ID remains unchanged until the sFlow service is restarted. At least one interface must be configured for an IP address to be assigned to the agent.

### Considerations

On QFX Series devices, limitations of sFlow traffic sampling include:
- Ingress interface sampling does not capture CPU-bound traffic.
- Egress interface sampling does not support broadcast and multicast packets.
- Egress samples do not contain modifications made to the packet in the egress pipeline.
- If a packet is discarded due to a firewall filter, the reason code for discarding the packet is not sent to the collector.
- The `out-priority` field for a VLAN is always set to 0 (zero) on ingress and egress samples.
- sFlow monitoring cannot be configured on a link aggregation group (LAG), but it can be configured individually on LAG member interfaces.
- On QFX10000 Series switches, for a set of ports in a multicast group, the minimum of the configured sFlow rate or the most aggressive sample rate among those ports is used for sampling across all ports in that group.
- Starting from Junos OS Release 19.4, on QFX10000 Series switches, if the destination port of a sampled UDP packet is 6635 and the packet does not include a valid MPLS header, the flow sampled packet may get corrupted or truncated.
- On QFX10000 Series standalone switches and QFX Series Virtual Chassis (with QFX3500 and QFX3600 switches), egress firewall filters are not applied to sFlow sampling packets. These packets are sent by the Routing Engine and not transiting the switch.

### Adaptive Sampling Fallback

The adaptive sampling fallback feature, when enabled, uses a binary backup algorithm to decrease the sampling rate (thus increasing the sampling load) when the number of samples generated is less than the configured `sample-limit-threshold` value, without affecting normal traffic.

- **Enabled in Junos OS Releases**:
  - EX Series switches: Starting in Junos OS Release 18.3R1.
  - MX Series, PTX Series, and QFX Series devices: Starting in Junos OS Release 19.1R1.

To enable this feature, include the `fallback` and `adaptive-sample-rate sample-limit-threshold` options in the `[edit protocols sflow adaptive-sample-rate]` hierarchy level.

After adaptive sampling has taken place and the line card is underperforming (i.e., the number of samples generated in a cycle is less than the configured `sample-limit-threshold` value) for five continuous cycles, the adapted rate is reversed. If the reverse adaptation has occurred and the number of samples generated in a cycle is less than half of the current adapted rate again (for five continuous cycles), another reverse adaptation can occur. Reverse adaptation does not occur if the interfaces are already at the configured rate.

### Adaptive Sampling Limitations

- **Standalone Routers or QFX Series Switches**: If sFlow is configured on multiple interfaces with a high sampling rate, it is recommended to specify a collector on the data network instead of the management network to avoid interference with other management interface traffic.
- **Graceful Restart**: sFlow does not support graceful restart on routers. During a graceful restart, the adaptive sampling rate is reset to the user-configured sampling rate.
- **Rate-Selectable Line Cards**: Interfaces with the highest sample count are selected for adaptive sampling fallback. The backup algorithm selects these interfaces and decreases the sampling rate every five seconds. On single-rate line cards, only one sample rate is supported per line card, and the adaptive sampling fallback mechanism backs up the sampling rate on all interfaces.

### Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Software and Other Utilities Overview

You can use Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software to validate the integrity of the QFX-PFA-4Q module and the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. The software includes standard diagnostics, orchestration diagnostics, Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and synchronization diagnostics, and other utilities. It runs in a guest virtual machine (VM) on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch, requiring the configuration of guest VM options in the Junos OS CLI.

The QFX-PFA-4Q module contains four 40-Gigabit Ethernet QSFP+ interfaces, an FPGA module, and timing input and output interfaces for PTP applications. The FPGA module can be customized for processing compute-intensive, latency-sensitive, high-volume transactions.

Before running the Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software and utilities, ensure the following:
- The QFX-PFA-4Q module is installed on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
- Junos OS Release 14.1X53-D27 with enhanced automation is installed on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch.
- The Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software is installed.

### External and Internal Ports and Network Interface Card Ports

Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software and utilities validate the data paths between external and internal ports on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch and QFX-PFA-4Q module. Figure 33 illustrates the port names and connections.

**Table 87: External and Internal Ports on the QFX5100-24Q-AA Switch and the QFX-PFA-4Q Module**

- **A-ports**: Interfaces `xe-0/0/24` through `xe-0/0/39` on the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch connect to the B-ports on the FPGA module on the QFX-PFA-4Q expansion module. These interfaces are managed through the Junos OS.
- **B-ports**: Internal 10-Gigabit Ethernet ports connect to the FPGA module on the QFX-PFA-4Q module, which then connects to the A-ports on the PFE of the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. The naming convention for these ports is determined by the guest VM, which controls the FPGA module.
- **C-ports**: Four front-facing 40-Gigabit Ethernet ports on the QFX-PFA-4Q module connect to the FPGA module running on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch and the F-ports on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. The guest VM controls the FPGA module.
- **D-ports**: Two 10-Gigabit Ethernet internal ports on the Packet Forwarding Engine of the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch connect to the Ethernet NIC on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. The naming convention for these ports is the same as for the F-ports. These ports are managed through the Junos OS.
- **F-ports**: Twenty-four front-facing 40-Gigabit Ethernet ports on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch. These ports have an "et" prefix in 40-Gigabit Ethernet mode and an "xe" prefix if channelized. They are managed through the Junos OS.
- **NIC ports**: Internal interfaces `xe-0/0/40` and `xe-0/0/41` on the QFX5100-24Q-AA switch connect to the PFE for use on the guest VM. These ports function like any other Linux OS NIC port and require the QFX-PFA-4Q module to be installed.

### Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics Software Tests and Scripts

You can run Packet Flow Accelerator Diagnostics software to test the following subsystems on the QFX-PFA-4Q module:
- FPGA
- QDR SRAM memory
- DRAM memory
- DRAM SPDs
- FPGA-connected PCI Express links
- FPGA-connected Ethernet data (QSFP interfaces)
- QSFP I2C I/O
- PTP I/O

Before running any test or script, connect to the console connection of the guest VM. The available test sets include:
- **quick-test**: Performs a basic test of all FPGA-attached functionality, taking one to two minutes.
- **burn-in**: Exercises all FPGA-attached functionality, taking several hours.
- **individual test mode**: Allows testing of a single subsystem with extra configuration options.

### Ikondiag Command

To run any of the tests, use the `ikondiag` command with the following arguments:
- `-t (quick-test | burn-in | )`: Identifies the test.
- `-h`: Provides usage details for the test.
- `-V`: Provides verbose output for the tests.

For example, to run the PTP test, issue the `ikondiag -t PTP` command at the guest VM prompt.

### Basic Functionality Tests

You can test basic functionality on the PCI Express interface and memory components. Table 88 lists the names of the tests and their functions.

### Ethernet Tests and Scripts

The Ethernet tests and scripts test C-ports and traffic between A- and B-ports. Traffic between A- and B-ports is tested by passing data on the F-ports. For C-ports, loop back the traffic sent on the C-ports using physical copper loopback cables. For F-ports, loop back the traffic sent on the F-ports and include them in a VLAN.
