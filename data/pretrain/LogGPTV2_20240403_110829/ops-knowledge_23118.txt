User: As far as I kown, there are about 3 ways to excute a system command in Python:

os.system(command) -> exit_status
os.popen(command [, mode='r' [, bufsize]]) -> pipe
commands.getoutput(command)-> string

Now I need to control the excutor of a system command, beside the way like: 
os.system('su xxx;' + command)
is there any other more elegant way to reach the same effect?
Assistant: All of the things you've mentioned (which have been succeeded by the subprocess module by the way) are ways of spawning processes. You sound like you're looking for setuid. You can either call a function that will do that (e.g. os.setuid), or, as often is the case depending on what your script does, you can just run the entire script as the elevated user.
