Hi there,
Please see this example: http://jsbin.com/ulopaj/4
There is a link with a tooltip applied in the modal.
I set a 'shown' event handler function to the modal, it works when the modal
is popped up, then try to hover the link inside the modal, the 'shown' event
handler will be invoked again.
You can see the source code of this example here:

Any help will be appreciated, thank you very much.
