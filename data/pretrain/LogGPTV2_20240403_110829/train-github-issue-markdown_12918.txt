Hello,

I would like to bring your attention to an example I have prepared, which can be found at the following link: [http://jsbin.com/ulopaj/4](http://jsbin.com/ulopaj/4).

In this example, there is a link within a modal that has a tooltip associated with it. I have attached a 'shown' event handler to the modal, which triggers when the modal is displayed. However, I have encountered an issue where the 'shown' event handler is re-invoked whenever I hover over the link inside the modal.

For your reference, you may view and edit the source code of this example here: [http://jsbin.com/ulopaj/4/edit](http://jsbin.com/ulopaj/4/edit).

Any assistance or suggestions regarding this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for your time and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
