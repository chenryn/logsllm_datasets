User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Event ID 17890 (A significant part... paged out.) with SQL Server 2008 I have a machine that has SQL Server 2008 Standard installed on a Windows 2003 R2 server. Periodically (about once an hour) I am getting Event ID 17890 several times in a row. An example: 

6:28:54 "A significant part of sql server process memory has been paged out. This may result in a performance degradation. Duration: 0 seconds. Working set (KB): 10652, committed (KB): 628428, memory utilization: 1%%.

6:34:27 "A significant part of sql server process memory has been paged out. This may result in a performance degradation. Duration: 332 seconds. Working set (KB): 169780, committed (KB): 546124, memory utilization: 31%%."

6:38:55 "A significant part of sql server process memory has been paged out. This may result in a performance degradation. Duration: 600 seconds. Working set (KB): 245068, committed (KB): 546124, memory utilization: 44%%."

This pattern repeated at 7:26 - 7:37, 8:26 - 8:36, 9:24 - 9:35 and so  with the same increasing working set and memory utilization pattern. I don't have any (known) background tasks running at this time. Backups run at 2:00

This subsided from 11:00 at night until it resumed at 4:00 in the morning and has been continuing the intermittent 10 minute glitch periods. 

As this server has plenty of RAM  (the commit charge has peaked at 2,871,564 of 4,194,012 physical) I disabled the paging files after reading several items I dug up searching Google and not finding any of them changing the situation. This pattern I am documented is after removing the paging files, so I'm not even sure where we are paging the SQL process could be going. I also changed the SQL process memory to have a minimum of 500MB and a maximum of 2GB of RAM (as this is a light duty database server serving only a small workgroup).

Has anyone encountered this? Prior to disabling the page files this error would cause 5 minutes of disk thrashing that disabled access to the databases, files, IIS webs and so on. Since disabling the page files it just logs strange things, but I'm not seeing a performance drop at least. Any suggestions would be welcome.

Assistant: After a talk with Microsoft Support, the official answer is: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2001745

Will not fix, will not workaround, only recommended upgrading operating system to some edition of 2008. I have moved my SQL install and decommissioned the server.
