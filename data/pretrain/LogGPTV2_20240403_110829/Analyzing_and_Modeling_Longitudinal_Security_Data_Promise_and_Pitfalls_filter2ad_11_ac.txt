effectively disrupted many spammers’ revenue streams [76]. Seven
months after the announcement of these requirements, spammers
reported difficulty maintaining reliable credit card processing [41]
and spam volume dropped significantly, e.g. Symantec’s Internet
Security Threat Report from 2012 notes a significant drop in
pharmaceutical spam [68].
4.3 Model Results
Table 1 gives the MLE values for the βx,y. Examining Table 1
we see that the autoregressive term has the largest influence on
future wickedness. Surprisingly, one of the other terms (regional
wickedness during the previous week) in all eras has an opposite
effect from what was reported in section 3 (Figure 3). This is an
example of Simpson’s Paradox [63], indicating that in the presence
of other variables, high levels of wickedness in neighboring ISPs
actually reduce future wickedness. One possible explanation is
that spammers initially try to infect as many machines in a region

as possible, and then concentrate on vulnerable ISPs as they
discover them, reducing attacks on the less vulnerable ISPs. This
factor and the other variables identified in section 2 are statis-
tically significant, but at low levels. This simple model accounts
for the vast majority of the variance in our data, with a combined
coefficient of determination of R2 =0.980 for data in all eras6. It
is possible that more sophisticated models might provide more
predictive power than our simple linear, autoregressive model.
We tested support vector machines, feed forward neural networks,
decision tree regression, and gradient tree boosting, and found that
none outperformed our model (measured by R2) or had similar
explanatory power. Moreover, our robust statistical approach
can determine statistical significance without computationally
expensive procedures, such as cross validation.
5. THE EFFECT OF TAKEDOWNS
Section 4 presented a statistical model that accurately assesses
the relative contribution of a variety of factors on spam levels over
almost a decade. This section shows how the model can be used
to study the impact of interventions such as botnet takedowns.
Although spam levels typically drop immediately following a
takedown, there is anecdotal evidence that this effect is short-
term, often returning to previous levels within a few weeks [43,
75, 62]. Given the high variance in the data, however, quantifying
the short-term and long-term effects is challenging, and requires
rigorous statistical testing. With only a small extension to the
model, we can conduct such tests and consider the impact of
takedowns on different regions of the world.
5.1 Modeling Takedowns
We model takedowns, which are a discrete event at the timescale
of our data, by adding binary variables to the model:
(cid:26) 1 takedown k occurred j weeks ago
(5)
Each Bk(t − j) is incorporated into the model with its own
coefficient, and the autoregressive model becomes:
0 otherwise
Bk(t−j)=
(cid:88)
l(cid:88)
βkjBk(t−j)
k
j=0
Equation 4+
(6)
βkj is the coefficient associated with Bk(t − j). Using the
log/linear form of Equation 6, we can estimate the general effect
of a takedown using the estimates of βkj. For each takedown,
the fractional change in wickedness associated with the takedown
(cid:80)l
during week j is eβkj −1. This process can be repeated to give
j=0βkj −1, which estimates the cumulative effect of the take-
e
down over the time period l. If the MLE of any one of the βkj is
6The autoregressive term accounts primarily accounts for the high
R2 in the model. However, without the autoregressive term the model
still has an R2 =0.58, indicating moderate explanatory power.

not statistically significant it is assumed to be 0. The statistical
significance of the estimated coefficients provides a rigorous test
of a takedown’s effect.
We incorporated 12 different historical botnet takedowns into
the extended model. We considered most major takedowns of
botnets in the time span of our dataset that sent large amounts
of spam. We allow i to vary from 0 (the week of the takedown) to
l =6 weeks. Beyond this time, we find no further statistically sig-
nificant changes that can be attributed to the takedown, implying
that the time horizon for the effect of a takedown is at most six
weeks. In some cases, two botnet takedowns overlap the six-week
windows, and we cannot separate the effect of the two takedowns.7.
When this occurs we include both the initial effect of the first
takedown and the combined effect of the second takedown.
The results are given in Table 2, which shows that the global
effectiveness of these botnet takedowns varies significantly. Some
takedowns were effective in the short run (6 out of 12), but over
the six-week window only three of those showed any persistent
significant decrease in spam.
The table shows that two takedowns (Bredolab and Rustock)
had a relatively large long-term impact on spam in the six weeks
following the takedown, while the third (Waledac) had a relatively
minor impact. Both the Bredolab and Rustock takedowns involved
physical seizure of offending infrastructure by law enforcement.
Although this may not be directly related to the effectiveness of
the takedowns, it is notable and is likely correlated with other
external factors that have more lasting effect. Four takedowns that
used communications disruption to shutdown the botnet showed
a positive short-term impact (i.e. McColo [35], Coreflood [40],
Grum [52], and Virut [42] ) are followed by long-term increases in
wickedness. The rest of the takedowns, such as the self shutdown
of spamit.com [77], seemed to have little positive impact either
initially or in the long-term. These values provide evidence that
other interventions were likely the main driver of the decline in
overall spam volumes, not botnet takedowns. We note that the
two effective takedowns occurred at the end of era 1 and the
beginning of era 2 respectively, however, without more data it is
impossible to draw further conclusions about the relationship be-
tween takedown effectiveness and the era in which they occurred.
In the case of Mariposa, our results may reflect the historic
details of the takedown. Shortly after the original takedown in
7An overlap results in two binary variables with the same value being
included in the model (perfect collinearity), which would cause an
ill-defined maximum likelihood calculation [79]

takedown studied the top panel shows the immediate effect by
geographic region, and the bottom panel shows the effect after

percent change in wickedness as indicated by the legend.
December, during which control of command-and-control servers
was obtained, attackers managed to regain control of the botnet
and launched denial-of-service attacks against numerous ISPs [9],
which may be related to the increased spamming activity.
5.2 Regional effects of botnet takedowns
Bots are not uniformly distributed geographically [53], suggest-
ing that takedowns might have different effects throughout the
world. To investigate this hypothesis we re-applied our modeling
approach, but at the regional level. Rather than creating a single
model for all ISPs globally, we constructed one model for each
geographic region defined in subsection 3.2, using only the ISPs
in that region. We included regions that have at least two ISPs
in our dataset to avoid over-fitting [79].
All takedowns showed varying effects for different regions (Fig-
ure 4). Some takedowns have effects regionally that resemble
the global effect seen in Table 2, while others have differentiated
behavior. For example, the McColo takedown initially appears
successful, but in the long term wickedness increases across nearly
This paper builds on the dataset of Van Eeten et al. [73], which
investigated ISPs as control points for mitigating the spread of
malware, using a comprehensive worldwide spam dataset. Here, we
updated the dataset with 6 more years of data. The Van Eeten et
al. analysis revealed that a country’s development level is correlated
with spam volume, and it analyzed how public policy initiatives
might reduce infections. We extend this work by developing a
data-driven statistical model, which the effect of different spam
interventions and identifies temporal transitions in the dataset.
Other work locates infected hosts in IP address space. Moura et
al. identified IP ranges with high concentrations of spam sending
hosts [53]. Similarly Ramachandran et al. examined the network-
level behavior of spammers, and showed that spam is concentrated
in relatively small IP ranges [61]. Stone-Gross et al. studied ISPs
with persistent malicious behavior [67], Chen et al. investigated
malicious sources on the Internet over IPv4 [6], and Wilcox et al.
studied the stability and availability of address space in spam and
non spam networks [78]. Kokkodis and Faloutsos showed that
spamming botnets have become more widely and thinly spread
over IP space, a potential problem for filtering [33]. However,
to our knowledge none of this work explores which topological
features of the AS network correlate with infected hosts. Addi-
tionally, our model shows that previous regional concentrations of
wickedness and malicious traffic correlate with future wickedness.
Collins et al. define uncleanliness as the probability that a host
is vulnerable [8], while wickedness measures the concentration of
active malicious hosts. They find that a network’s past behavior
is strongly correlated with its future behavior, which agrees with
our finding that wickedness is autocorrelated.
Another related area proposes using economics to control mal-
ware and spam [28, 55, 44]. The idea of disrupting spammers’
income by targeting the small number of banks that handle credit
card payments [49, 29] may have helped reduce global spam levels.
A related approach is the publication of infection rates of ISPs
(measured by spam volumes) to provide incentives for them to
control compromised customers in their networks [70].
There are few models of global malware dynamics. Venkatara-
man et al. model malicious activity as a decision tree over IP
address space and infer the dynamics of the decision tree [74].
Their work focuses on IP address ranges rather than ISPs, but
it reports some similar results as those observed in our model,
for example, high variance in the data. Zhang et al. find that
mismanagement of networks correlates with malicious behavior
(measured using a quantity similar to our wickedness) in Au-
tonomous Systems[82], but do not focus on how this behavior
might evolve over time. Liu et al. use support vector machines
trained on data from reputation blacklists to predict security
incidents [46]. These predictions could be incorporated into our
model to better predict some of the large changes in wickedness
over time. A model of global malware dynamics was also proposed
by Hofmeyr et al., which used an agent-based model to investigate
the dynamics of malicious traffic flowing across the Internet at
the AS level [25]. This model was significantly more abstract
than ours, and did not incorporate actual data about spam, ISPs,
demographic features, or intervention events such as takedowns.
Nadji et al. analyze botnet takedown efficacy [54], and other
work considers raw measurements of spam volume [20]. Nadji et al.
investigated three historical takedowns, performing post mortem
analysis of each takedown’s effectiveness, by measuring which
malicious domains could still be resolved in the Domain Name
Service (DNS). Contrary to our results, this work recommends
DNS takedowns for a large fraction of current botnets. However,
their results rely on relatively short time scales (two weeks), and it
only considers the DNS, which may not be sufficient to identify re-
bounds once attackers establish new communication channels [18].
Mechanistic botnet models, e.g. [34, 80, 10, 7, 30], focus on
Figure 5: Country-specific effect of botnet takedowns in Eastern
Europe. For each historical takedown studied, the top panel shows
the immediate effect for each country, and the bottom panel shows
the effect after six weeks for the same country. The color shows
the percent change in wickedness as indicated by the legend.
all regions (blue colors, upper panel in Figure 4, and red colors,
lower panel in Figure 4, respectively), similar to the global effect.
In contrast, two of the takedowns led to mixed effects throughout
the world. Six weeks after the Hermes Carberp takedown, wicked-
ness in Australia/New Zealand, Eastern Asia, and South-Eastern
Asia decreased, but most other regions experienced increases.
Similarly, six weeks following the Grum takedown, wickedness
in South America had declined significantly, but the rest of the
world experienced increases. These differentiated regional effects
occur predominately in the second and third eras.
We can further analyze the effect of botnet takedowns on
individual countries by constructing one model for each country,
using the same procedure as we did for regions. Once again, we
consider only countries with more than two ISPs in our dataset to
avoid overfitting. Figure 5 shows the effect of various takedowns
only on countries in Eastern Europe due to space constraints. We
focus on Eastern Europe because it shows interesting variation
among its countries. However, most other regions also showed
significant variation.
Consistent with the earlier analyses, there are many countries
