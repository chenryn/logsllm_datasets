ABSTRACT
Cyber-physical systems are increasingly threatened by sophisti-
cated attackers, also attacking the physical aspect of systems. Sup-
plementing protective measures, industrial intrusion detection sys-
tems promise to detect such attacks. However, due to industrial
protocol diversity and lack of standard interfaces, great efforts are
required to adapt these technologies to a large number of different
protocols. To address this issue, we identify existing universally ap-
plicable intrusion detection approaches and propose a transcription
for industrial protocols to realize protocol-independent semantic
intrusion detection on top of different industrial protocols.

1 MOTIVATION
Incidents such as Stuxnet [4] or the attack on the Ukrainian power
grid [13] highlight the necessity to secure cyber-physical systems
(CPS) against attacks, especially since these systems are progres-
sively integrated to the Internet. Since existing industrial hardware
can not be replaced or updated easily, network separation, firewalls,
or VPNs promise to prevent such attacks. However, as sophisticated
attackers still might circumvent protective security measures, in-
trusion detection systems (IDS) are important to detect remaining
attacks.
Indeed, various detection mechanisms have been proposed for
various industrial use cases. Especially in CPSs, IDSs can leverage
physical process knowledge for anomaly detection since, e.g., the

Figure 1: Industrial protocols communication behavior can
be abstracted to these three scenarios.
procedures for a given production plant are known. Thus, attacks
can be detected by, e.g., modeling communication patterns with
automata [2, 6, 9, 15], finding invariants for physical processes [5],
detecting critical states with logic formulas [8], fingerprinting phys-
ical processes [1], comparing the current physical process state to a
simulation [3], or analyzing packet time intervals [14]. While these
mechanisms could, in principle, be widely applicable as they only
depend on process variables or communication patterns, their im-
plementations are usually confined to a specific industrial protocol.
Historically, industrial protocols were designed for unique ap-
plication requirements, resulting in a variety of special-purpose
protocols. This diversity hinders applying IDS techniques to dif-
ferent protocols. As detection mechanisms typically only operate
on communication patterns, or on the current physical state, we
propose to transcribe industrial protocol messages into abstract
information objects as the foundation for protocol-independent
intrusion detection.
Optimally, a universal and widely deployed industrial protocol
would obviate the need to adapt IDSs with a protocol transcription.
But, since CPS communication requirements are largely diverse
(due to varying constraints on devices, real-time requirements, or
the need for authenticated or encrypted communications), such a
general industrial protocol seems utopistic. Even if unifying the
industrial protocol landscape becomes feasible in the future, IDSs
are retrofitted for existing CPSs where specific protocols are already
in use and irreplaceable. Our approach of transcribing industrial
protocols into abstract protocol messages helps to realize protocol-
independent industrial IDSs. Therefore, it is important to preserve
essential communication features throughout the transcription pro-
cess, such as communication patterns and message relationships.
Despite their huge diversity, transcribing industrial protocols
is possible as they share essential commonalities like supervision
and control of physical processes. First, we observe a shift towards
IP-based communication for industrial protocols, easing passive
network monitoring. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, industrial
protocols’ communication behavior can be abstracted into three dis-
tinctive patterns: (a) pushing messages to single or multiple devices,
(b) request and response, or (c) calls with an optional response.
Finally, while protocol specifications dedicate great efforts to value
