## Poster: Facilitating Protocol-Independent Industrial Intrusion Detection Systems

### Abstract
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are increasingly under threat from sophisticated attackers who target both the digital and physical aspects of these systems. While protective measures such as network separation, firewalls, and virtual private networks (VPNs) can help, intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential for detecting attacks that bypass these defenses. However, the diversity of industrial protocols and the lack of standard interfaces make it challenging to adapt IDS technologies to a wide range of protocols. To address this issue, we identify universally applicable intrusion detection approaches and propose a transcription method for industrial protocols. This method enables protocol-independent semantic intrusion detection across different industrial protocols.

## 1. Motivation
Incidents like Stuxnet [4] and the attack on the Ukrainian power grid [13] underscore the need to secure cyber-physical systems (CPS) against sophisticated attacks. As these systems become more integrated with the Internet, traditional security measures such as network separation, firewalls, and VPNs are often insufficient. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a crucial role in detecting attacks that circumvent these defenses.

Various detection mechanisms have been proposed for different industrial use cases. In CPS, IDS can leverage physical process knowledge for anomaly detection. For example, known procedures in a production plant can be used to detect anomalies. Detection methods include modeling communication patterns with automata [2, 6, 9, 15], finding invariants for physical processes [5], detecting critical states with logic formulas [8], fingerprinting physical processes [1], comparing the current physical state to a simulation [3], or analyzing packet time intervals [14]. While these methods are generally applicable, their implementations are often specific to particular industrial protocols.

Historically, industrial protocols were designed to meet unique application requirements, resulting in a diverse array of specialized protocols. This diversity hinders the application of IDS techniques across different protocols. Since detection mechanisms typically operate on communication patterns or the current physical state, we propose transcribing industrial protocol messages into abstract information objects. This approach forms the foundation for protocol-independent intrusion detection.

Ideally, a universal and widely deployed industrial protocol would eliminate the need for protocol-specific adaptations. However, the diverse communication requirements of CPS (e.g., real-time constraints, authentication, encryption) make a single, general-purpose industrial protocol impractical. Even if unification becomes feasible in the future, existing CPSs already use specific, irreplaceable protocols. Our approach of transcribing industrial protocols into abstract messages helps to realize protocol-independent IDS. It is crucial to preserve essential communication features, such as patterns and message relationships, throughout the transcription process.

Despite their diversity, industrial protocols share commonalities, such as supervision and control of physical processes. We observe a trend towards IP-based communication, which simplifies passive network monitoring. Additionally, industrial protocols' communication behavior can be abstracted into three distinct patterns: (a) pushing messages to one or multiple devices, (b) request and response, and (c) calls with optional responses. These patterns, along with the shift towards IP-based communication, facilitate the transcription process.
