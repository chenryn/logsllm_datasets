I recently ran `yarn upgrade` to gain access to the `Select` component. While Material-UI did update, it seems that there is a bug in the latest release version. I am consistently encountering a build error:

```
ERROR in ./node_modules/material-ui/Chip/Chip.js
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../svg-icons/Cancel' in '\node_modules\material-ui\Chip'

```

I have attempted to restart the server to rule out any temporary glitches, but the issue persists.
