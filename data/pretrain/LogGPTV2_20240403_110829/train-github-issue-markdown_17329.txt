I just did a `yarn upgrade` in order to get access to the `Select` component.
Material UI updated, but it appears there's a bug in the release version; I
keep getting a build error:
    ERROR in ./node_modules/material-ui/Chip/Chip.js
    Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../svg-icons/Cancel' in '\node_modules\material-ui\Chip'
     @ ./node_modules/material-ui/Chip/Chip.js 58:14-44

     @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://localhost:8080 webpack/hot/dev-server ./src/index.js
I've tried restarting the server to make sure it's not just a fluke, but I
can't get rid of the issue.
