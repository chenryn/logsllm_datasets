I'm working on an extension and have a `CompletionItemProvider`. It works good
when writing code. But it's annoying when it pops up suggestions inside of
strings and comments.  
I don't want the suggestions to appear in that cases.
I had a look at other extensions on how they solve this problem. The
TypeScript plugin has got these lines:
    function TypeScriptCompletionItemProvider(client) {
        this.triggerCharacters = ['.'];
        this.excludeTokens = ['string', 'comment', 'numeric'];
        this.sortBy = [{ type: 'reference', partSeparator: '/' }];
        this.client = client;
        this.config = configuration_1.defaultConfiguration;
    }
I tried to define the `excludeTokens` in the same way but it doesn't work. How
can I prevent the `CompletionItemProvider` from being executed in strings and
comments?
