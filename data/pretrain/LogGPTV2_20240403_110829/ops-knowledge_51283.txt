User: I have installed Python 3.2 in my Mac. After I run /Applications/Python 3.2/Update Shell Profile.command, it's confusing that when I type Python -V in Terminal it says that Python 2.6.1.
How can I change the default Python version?
Assistant: I am using OS X 10.7.5 and Python 3.4.2. If you type python3 and what you want to run it will run it using python 3. For example 
pyhton3 test001.py. That ran a test program I made called test001. I hope this helps.
