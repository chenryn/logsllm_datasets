User: How to use the logging tools provided by Linux for logging and analysis?
Assistant: Linux provides many different logging tools, including syslog, rsyslog, journalctl, etc. The following describes how to use syslog and journalctl for logging and analysis. Use syslog for logging and analysis: 1. Configure syslog: configure syslog in the /etc/syslog.conf file to define the format and destination of the log. For example, the following is a sample configuration that logs all syslog to the /var/log/syslog file: ``` *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none /var/log/syslog ``` 2 . Restart the syslog service: Use the following command to restart the syslog service: ``` sudo service syslog restart ``` 3. View the log: Use the following command to view the log recorded in the /var/log/syslog file: ``` sudo tail - f /var/log/syslog ``` Use journalctl for logging and analysis: 1. Query the logs of a specific unit: Use the following command to query the logs of a specific unit (such as ssh service): ``` sudo journalctl -u ssh.service ``` 2. Real-time monitoring logs: Use the following command to monitor all logs in real time: ``` sudo journalctl -f ``` 3. Filter logs: Use the following command to filter logs by keyword: ``` sudo journalctl -u ssh. service | grep "Failed" ```
