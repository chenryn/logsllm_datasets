I work in an environment where we are not allowed to log on as administrator
accounts we must Shift click -> "Run as" to use any admin privileges.
Currently the Win Terminal only supports run as Administrator but in order to
use this daily I need to be able to run this as an arbitrary user. To this
date I don't think I have seen any UWP support this and thus it might not be
possible.
Bonus : It would be even better if I could launch each tab as different users
while having the settings and core UI under my user.
Thanks in advance
P.S. I hate the security policy
