User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Error 1069 the service did not start due to a logon failure Our CruiseControl.NET service on Win2003 Server (VMWare Virtual) was recently changed from a service account to a user account to allow for a new part of our build process to work.

The new user has "Log on as a service" rights, verified by checking Local Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment, and the user password is set to never expire.

The problem I'm facing is every time the service is restarted, I get the 1069 error as described in this questions subject. I have to go into the properties of the service (log on tab) and re-enter the password, even though it hasn't changed, and the user already has the appropriate rights.

Once I enter the password apply the changes, a prompt appears telling me that the user has been granted log on as a service rights.  The service will then start will no problems.

Not a show stopper, but a pain none-the-less.  Why isn't the password persisting with the service?

Assistant: When you enter the password manually, the user is added to the 'Log on as service' list. I think you have group policy on the network which is overwriting this user list. After it overwrites you will have the same problem.
