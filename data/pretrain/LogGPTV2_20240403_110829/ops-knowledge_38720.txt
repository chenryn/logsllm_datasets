User: I am deciding whether to install python 3.4 or 2.7 on my home server running Ubuntu Server 14.04.2. I want to ensure that it has support from all the most used python libraries (scipy, numpy, requests, etc) but I am not sure how many of these packages fully support 3.4.
Do all 2.7 packages work on 3.4? If no, what are the differences between the two that causes this errors?
Assistant: Minor versions of python are mostly backwards compatible, however major versions do not maintain backwards compatibility. There are many libraries that work with both, but the language itself does not make that guarantee.
