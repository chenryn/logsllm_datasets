Question: In a recent audit of a company's IT infrastructure, a security analyst discovered that although the authentication system correctly implements multi-factor authentication (MFA), there are reports of unauthorized access. Upon further investigation, it was found that the system permits unlimited login attempts. What is the most likely cause-and-effect relationship between the design decision and the reported unauthorized access?
"A": "Unlimited login attempts allow brute-force attacks, rendering MFA ineffective if one factor is weak.",
"B": "Unlimited login attempts may cause system overload and downtime, indirectly affecting authentication integrity.",
"C": "Without a limit on login attempts, the encryption keys used for MFA could become compromised over time.",
"D": "Unlimited login attempts could lead to faster discovery of session tokens, allowing attackers to hijack authenticated sessions."
Answer: A
