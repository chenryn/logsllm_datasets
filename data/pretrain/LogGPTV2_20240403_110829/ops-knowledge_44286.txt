User: Please list several common network security vulnerabilities, and provide corresponding repair methods and strategies.
Assistant: 1. SQL injection vulnerability: Attackers inject malicious code into SQL statements to obtain sensitive information in the database. Patching methods include using parameterized queries, restricting access to the database, and regularly updating the database with patches. 2. Cross-site scripting attack (XSS): The attacker obtains sensitive information of the user by injecting script code on the webpage. Fixes include filtering and validating user input, using safe programming languages and frameworks, and escaping user input when displaying it. 3. CSRF attack: Attackers perform malicious operations by forging legitimate user requests, such as changing user information or transferring funds. Fixes include using random tokens, setting user session timeouts, using POST instead of GET when possible, and validating requests. 4. File contains loopholes: Attackers use loopholes in the website to include malicious files into the webpage, thereby executing malicious code or obtaining sensitive information. Fixes include restricting user access to files, avoiding hardcoding file paths, and using whitelisting mechanisms to scope file access. 5. Information disclosure vulnerability: Attackers steal sensitive information on websites, such as user accounts, passwords, and credit card information. Patching methods include using encryption protocols, restricting user access, monitoring website traffic, and implementing intelligence gathering and analysis to discover and eliminate unknown security holes.
