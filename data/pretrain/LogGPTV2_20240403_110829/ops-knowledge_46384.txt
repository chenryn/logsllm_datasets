User: Suppose we are deploying a Docker-based microservice application, how to realize the communication and mutual calling between different services?
Assistant: In a Docker-based microservice application, communication and mutual invocation between different services can be achieved in the following ways: 1. Direct access using container names: In Docker, each container has a unique name, and the container can be used directly to access services running in other containers. 2. Use the Docker network: In Docker, you can create your own Docker network and add different containers to it, so that you can communicate and call in the containers in the same network. 3. Use service discovery tools: Service discovery tools can help each service in a microservice application discover each other, and provide load balancing and routing functions, such as Consul, etcd, etc. 4. Use API gateway: API gateway can be used as the entrance of microservice application, distribute all requests to different services, and be responsible for routing, load balancing, security check and other functions, such as NGINX, Kong, etc. To sum up, in a Docker-based microservice application, you can choose a communication and calling method that suits your own application scenario, so as to realize the interconnection and mutual calling between services.
