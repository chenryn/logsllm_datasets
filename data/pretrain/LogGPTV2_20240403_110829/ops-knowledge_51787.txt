User: I am trying to make an executable python program on MAC OSX. I used the build applet program and it runs, but I had some data printing in the shell window and the executable file does not open a window. Is there a way to open a shell window with an executable python program?
Thanks
Assistant: Not sure about generating another shell window, but do you need to have an entire shell open? What about getting the information to the user in a different way, such as:

use another Toplevel window and insert the output into a Text or Listbox, rather than simply printing it.  This could also make it easier for users to copy the output (if that's something they might find useful).
write out a data/log file.
