APPENDIX
A. Legal Requirements for Privacy Policies
The following privacy policy requirements are covered
by PrivacyFlash Pro and, where indicated, by the examined
questionnaire-based generators.13 Also, an omission or wrong
disclosure can be an unfair or deceptive act or practice [15
USC §45].
13The App Privacy Policy Generator [7] does not claim to be compliant
with any of the laws and, thus, is not included in the analysis.
COPPA Requirement
Name, address, telephone number, and email address of all operators collecting or maintaining personal
information from children or of one operator who will respond to all inquiries if names of all operators
are also listed [§312.4(d)(1)]

◦ None of the above; PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged all of the above resources that are used by my app
[Multiple choice; answer required; answer on a scale of “Very difﬁcult 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 5 – 6 – 7 Very easy”]
• If PrivacyFlash Pro did not ﬂag a resource your app is using per the previous question, please provide a link to the site

with the instructions that you followed to integrate the resource in your app. [Long answer text; answer not required]
◦ Advertising networks
◦ Analytics services
[Checkboxes; answer required]
◦ PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged the BLUETOOTH permission, but my app is not using it
◦ PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged the CALENDARS permission, but my app is not using it
◦ PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged FACEBOOK LOGIN, but my app is not using it
◦ PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged GOOGLE LOGIN, but my app is not using it
◦ PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged use of an SDK, but my app is not using it
◦ None of the above; all resources that PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged are used by my app
• If PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged a resource that your app is not using per the previous question, did you still ﬁnd it useful that
PrivacyFlash Pro ﬂagged it? (In particular, Privacy Flash Pro is intended to help developers maintaining a clean codebase
by ﬂagging unreachable code.) [Multiple choice; answer not required]
◦ Yes
◦ Other [Short answer text; answer required if selected]
• How likely is it that you would recommend PrivacyFlash Pro to a friend or colleague? [Net Promoter Score (NPS); multiple

C. Improvement Suggestions from the iOS Developer Community
We received the following responses to our question “How could we improve PrivacyFlash Pro?” in the usability survey.
(1) No suggestion (16)
(2) Implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a native desktop app (6)
(3) Improve the UI/UX (e.g., the color scheme or toggle switches) (4)
(4) Add support for multiple policy ﬁle formats (e.g., Word and pdf) (3)
(5) Be more transparent about what is being done with the source code during the analysis (3)
(6) Make the tooltips more speciﬁc, extensive, or explain more of the law (2)
(7) Add to the third party library analysis more details on what they are doing and what their risks are (2)
(8) Implement PrivacyFlash Pro as a web app for analyzing code repositories online (2)
(9) Allow developers to manually include or exclude ﬁles or directories from the analysis (2)
(10) Create a marketplace for lawyers to conﬁrm the generated policies (1)
(11) Add options “Maybe” or “I don’t know/not sure” to the wizard (1)
(12) Add functionality to store and modify generated policies (1)
(13) Make the setup process easier (1)
(14) Add multi-language support (1)
D. Comments from the iOS Developer Community
We received the following comments from study participants via the Upwork chat [72] or e-mail. Additional comments were
provided on Reddit’s r/iOSProgramming [57] where we solicited participants for our study. Neither comment was prompted for.
(1) “Thanks for this awesome application, very helpful”
(2) “As a developer, I am very pleased to use PrivacyFlash Pro.”
(3) “It is great. Awesome work I am really impressed.”
(4) “I found [PrivacyFlash Pro] very useful for future porpose [sic].”
(5) “I’ll use the application while developing iOS apps. It is great.”
(6) “This tool is amazing! Congratulations. I really mean that.”
(7) “i do really like privacy ﬂash pro”
(8) “Your project is very interested [sic], but honestly I have never written the privacy info myself. But I realize how to make
privacy doc easily. if I need to write [...] that, I will recommend to use your program”
(9) “it is quite useful”
(10) “Neat tool you got there. It would be awesome to have something similar for GDPR too.14 One thing tho, for the ﬂags, in
my opinion, it’s a bit confusing to add/remove any ﬂags. I got a ﬂag for a 3rd party lib, but it was a bit misleading on how
to remove id [sic]. Anyway, congrats on the cool tool and good luck !”
(11) “Overall it was very easy to use your app for creating privacy policy.”
(12) “Really cool thing for Privacy Policy creation”
(13) “I’ll give it a try when I will release a personal project in about 4 weeks[.] It’s a good tool, but in the past when I released a
large number of apps under my name, I did not pay so much attention to the privacy policy. I was just using a template[.]”
(14) “I’ve found your app very useful. It is really easy to use.”
(15) “I just expected it to run as a native app instead of opening a browser[.] Anyways, seems like a really cool app,
congratulations[.] I will return to it if I ever need a new privacy policy[.]”
(16) “Awesome tool, help [sic] to avoid routine work.”
(17) “I like this product and idea itself. I did not create many policies by myself but I’ve never heard/used something like your
product. It can save a lot of time and help [...] many people, I think.”
(18) “I like your product, and will consider using it in the future.”
(19) “thanks for letting me know about PrivacyFlash Pro software, it can really help every Swift developer out there.”
(20) “This looks awesome! Well done. Looking forward to giving this a try on a project
I’m working on soon.”
[r/iOSProgramming]
(21) “[author name], congratulations to you and your team for the great work! PFP looks (and acts) more like a commercial
product that [sic] a research prototype :)” [r/iOSProgramming]
(22) “Saved this one for later. I cancelled working on my ﬁrst app because of privacy policies” [r/iOSProgramming]
(23) “This is pretty cool! Would it be possible to skip the code analysis and allow for creating a privacy policy by just ﬁlling
out the questionnaire? I currently use Termly and I’d love to switch over to this and host it myself. Good job, y’all!”
[r/iOSProgramming]
(24) “This is really cool! Are there any plans for React Native support?” [r/iOSProgramming]
14Note that GDPR provisions are included in PrivacyFlash Pro.
