**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Audit

**Description:**
To ensure the integrity of project files and verify that they have not been tampered with by adversaries, perform a thorough audit. This involves comparing the cryptographic hash of the file against a known, trusted version. Additionally, check for other indicators of modification, such as changes in timestamps.

**Steps:**
1. **Cryptographic Hash Comparison:**
   - Generate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) for the file.
   - Compare this hash with the hash of a known, trusted version of the file.
   - If the hashes do not match, it indicates that the file has been modified.

2. **Timestamp Analysis:**
   - Examine the creation, modification, and access timestamps of the file.
   - Look for any unexpected or recent changes that may indicate unauthorized modifications.

By following these steps, you can effectively detect and respond to potential adversary behavior, ensuring the integrity and security of your project files.
