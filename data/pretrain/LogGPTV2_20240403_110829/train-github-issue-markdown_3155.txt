When I add screenshots to a test, the test report displays the name twice.
While, functionally, this isn't an issue, the detail oriented part of me is
annoyed by this :)
    const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ fullPage: true });
    await test.info().attach(name, { body: screenshot, contentType: 'image/png' });

I have tried specifying the path when taking a screenshot, and that does not
produce the duplicate file name in the report, however, I want to use the
default behavior in Playwright for taking screenshots, as it cleans up the
screenshot directory every time the tests are run.
