undetermined state. The actual state of leaves emerges after hop-
by-hop flow controls cease to take effect. Besides, the chances are
that new congestion tree forms right after a port dismisses from
the undetermined state. Therefore, the key to congestion detection
is to capture state transitions among ternary states.

4 TERNARY CONGESTION DETECTION
This section first presents the transition conditions among ternary
states (§ 4.1). Then we give the conceptual ON-OFF model and
uniform design of TCD (§ 4.2). We introduce the practical designs
and parameter settings for CEE (§ 4.3) and InfiniBand (§ 4.4). Last,
some implementation issues are discussed in § 4.5.
4.1 Congestion State Transitions
Figure 6 illustrates state transitions among ternary states in switch
ports. Overall, state transitions 1(cid:2) and 2(cid:2) are the same as in lossy
tion as the port is continuous ON. Since state transitions 3(cid:2) to 6(cid:2)
networks, where the queue length is the primary transition condi-
are introduced by the new undetermined state in lossless networks,
the crucial task is to figure out the transition conditions correlated
with the undetermined state.
Assume the duration of an ON period is 𝑇𝑜𝑛. Our key insight
is that a port in a continuous ON sending pattern has infinite 𝑇𝑜𝑛,
while a port in an ON-OFF sending pattern usually has a limited
𝑇𝑜𝑛 since the port is paused intermittently. Therefore, we can rely
on a 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛) to distinguish between the continuous ON sending
pattern and ON-OFF sending pattern.
State transitions to the undetermined state ( 3(cid:2) and 6(cid:2)). As
soon as the port enters an ON-OFF sending pattern, the port transits
to the undetermined state. The beginning of an ON-OFF sending
pattern is paused (OFF) by hop-by-hop flow controls. When each
packet dequeues (the port is ON), switches calculate the current
𝑇𝑜𝑛, which is the difference between the current timestamp and
the timestamp when the latest OFF period ends. If the current 𝑇𝑜𝑛
is smaller than 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛), the port is considered as entering an
ON-OFF sending pattern. Otherwise, the port does not transit to
an undetermined state.
State transitions from the undetermined state to
non-congestion or congestion state ( 4(cid:2) and 5(cid:2)). The transition
conditions from the undetermined state to non-congestion or con-
gestion state are two-folds:
(1) The condition of leaving the undetermined state: from the
ON-OFF sending pattern to the continuous ON pattern. Similar
to state transitions 3(cid:2) and 6(cid:2), if 𝑇𝑜𝑛 is larger than 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛), we
consider the port has been released from an undetermined state.
(2) The condition of entering congestion or non-congestion state
after leaving the undetermined state: the feature of queue length
evolution. After 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛) expires, it may take some time for the
port to drain out the accumulated packets caused by OFF. If the
queue length decreases after releasing from the undetermined state,
indicating that the actual input rate does not exceed the line rate,
so the port transits to the non-congestion state. Otherwise, the port
transits to the congestion state. To obtain the trend of queue length
evolution, switches can check the queue size every period 𝑇 . Once
the queue size increases in the current period 𝑇 and exceeds the
threshold, the current state transits to congestion. The current state
changes to non-congestion if the queue size has already decreased
to a low threshold value.
Congestion marking. Switches should conduct packet mark-
ing to notify endpoints when detecting transitions to the congestion
state. We advocate that switches should also inform the transitions
to the undetermined state to endpoints. Specifically, flows only
passing through undetermined ports may be only victim flows.
By providing information about the undetermined state, switches
enable end-to-end congestion controls to conduct different rate
adjustments for undetermined flows and congested flows according
to different requirements and trade-offs. To this end, TCD supports
ternary congestion notification, as shown in Table 1. In detail, pack-
ets may go through multiple ports with different states along the
path. If a packet first passes through an undetermined port, then a
congestion port, this packet should be considered as experiencing
congestion. If a packet only goes through an undetermined port,
the corresponding flow is undetermined. We use code point 10 to
indicate the undetermined state encountered (UE). UE can only be
marked when the current code point is not CE. Switches mark CE
whenever the port is in a congestion state.
Based on the state transitions among ternary states, we propose
Ternary Congestion Detection (TCD) in lossless networks, which
can detect congestion, non-congestion, and undetermined state of
switch ports. The state transitions 3(cid:2), 4(cid:2), 5(cid:2), and 6(cid:2) indicate that the
foundation of TCD is the parameter 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛). It determines when
entering and leaving the undetermined state, hence the transition
to the congestion state. The crucial problem is to determine the
value of 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛).
4.2 Conceptual ON-OFF Model
We build a conceptual ON-OFF model to describe 𝑇𝑜𝑛 in lossless
networks, as shown in Figure 7. During each ON period, the ingress
queue length in the downstream port continues to increase. When
the queue length increases to an upper bound 𝐵1, the upstream port
is supposed to pause, and the ON period ends. The upstream port

is supposed to recover ON when the ingress queue length in the
downstream port decreases to 𝐵0. The dynamic behavior of queue
length and ON-OFF sending style repeat in the steady state. Key
parameters are listed in Table 2.
Ideally, the upstream port ceases transmitting when the down-
stream ingress queue length exceeds 𝐵1 and recovers transmitting
when the downstream ingress queue length is below 𝐵0. However,
it takes some time for ON and OFF messages to take effect on the
upstream port. Assume 𝜏 is the response time to cease transmitting
(or start transmitting). Then the actual maximum and minimum of
ingress queue length are related to 𝜏. We have
𝑇𝑜𝑛 =
𝐵1 − 𝐵0 + 𝜏𝑅𝑑
𝑅𝑖 − 𝑅𝑑
+ 𝜏
(1)
𝑅𝑑 is the average draining rate of a congested flow, which is the
allocated bandwidth at the congested egress port. In the ON-OFF
sending pattern, 𝑅𝑖 is always larger than 𝑅𝑑 . We define 𝜀 to represent
the congestion degree experienced by a congested flow, with a larger
value representing a larger extent of congestion. Substituting it into
Eqn (1), we have
𝑇𝑜𝑛 =
𝐵1 − 𝐵0 + 𝜏𝑅𝑑
𝜀𝐶
+ 𝜏
(2)
The key of 𝑇𝑜𝑛 is 𝑅𝑑 and 𝜀, which may vary under different
congestion scenarios. To obtain 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛), we first consider the
upper bound of 𝑅𝑑 . The general congestion scenario is multiple
senders sending to one receiver simultaneously. Since the simplest
case is two flows contending for one bottleneck link, the maximum
bandwidth a congested flow can allocate among all congestion
scenarios is C/2. Hence 𝑅𝑑 satisfies 𝑅𝑑 ≤ 𝐶/2. Then the upper
bound of 𝑇𝑜𝑛 can be further obtained as follows:
Figure 8: The relationship between 𝜀, 𝑅𝑑 and 𝑇𝑜𝑛. The z-value
of the flat plane is 𝑇𝑜𝑛 when 𝜀 = 0.05.
𝑇𝑜𝑛 ≤ 2(𝐵1 − 𝐵0) + 𝜏𝐶
+ 𝜏
2𝜀𝐶
(3)
According to Eqn (3), 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛) is determined by 𝜀, which can be
close to zero as 𝑅𝑖 > 𝑅𝑑 . We conclude that if the difference between
𝐵1 and 𝐵0 is independent to 𝜀, 𝑇𝑜𝑛 is unbounded. For example, the
recommended value of the difference between 𝐵1 and 𝐵0 is 2𝑀𝑇𝑈
in PFC [56]. However, a reasonable 𝜀 can adapt to most cases, which
is enough for switches to distinguish between the ON-OFF send-
ing pattern and continuous ON pattern. Figure 8 demonstrates the
values of 𝑇𝑜𝑛 when 𝜏 = 8𝜇𝑠, 𝐶 = 40𝐺𝑏𝑝𝑠. 𝑇𝑜𝑛 increases first slowly
then rapidly as 𝜀 decreases. Note that as 𝜀 decreases, the frequency
that the hop-by-hop flow control is triggered also decreases. In prac-
tice, a minimal 𝜀 is improper since it leads to a very large 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛).
Too large 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛) may defer the detection of the congestion state
when a port is leaving an undetermined state. We empirically rec-
ommend 𝜀 to 0.05 because it can already cover most values of 𝑇𝑜𝑛.
The recommended setting is also verified through simulations in
§ 5.1.4. We will further elaborate on the value of 𝑚𝑎𝑥 (𝑇𝑜𝑛) in the
practical designs for CEE and InfiniBand.
