User:  How to setup and start a local Nginx web server?
Assistant: The following are the steps to set up and start the local Nginx web server under Windows: 1. Download and install the latest stable version of Nginx. It can be downloaded from the official website http://nginx.org/en/download.html. 2. Unzip the downloaded Nginx compressed package to any directory. For example, the decompressed folder name is nginx-1.18.0. 3. Find the nginx.exe file in the decompressed folder, and double-click to run it. 4. Open any browser and enter http://localhost in the address bar of the browser. If the words "Welcome to nginx!" appear, it means that Nginx has been successfully installed and started. 5. Copy the static page to be served (such as index.html) to the default service directory of Nginx, that is, unzip the html folder in the nginx folder. 6. Enter http://localhost/index.html in the address bar of the browser. If the static page can be displayed normally, it means that Nginx has successfully served. In the Linux system, you can install and start Nginx with the following commands: 1. sudo apt-get update 2. sudo apt-get install nginx 3. sudo systemctl start nginx 4. Enter the IP address of the server in the browser address bar Or domain name, you can see the Nginx welcome interface. 5. Put the static page to be served under /usr/share/nginx/html/ under the default service directory and then access it through the file path in the browser address bar.
