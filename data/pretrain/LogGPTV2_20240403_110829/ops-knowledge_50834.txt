User: 请选择TimeSeriesClassification领域相关问题的正确答案及解释Analyze the following time series
[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,80.1,0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.5,0.0,0.0,26.9,0.0,0.0,20.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,53.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,94.8,0.0]
Narrowly speaking, periodic data indicates the presence of periodic fluctuations, stationary data indicates a relatively constant mean, and sparse data indicates very few non-zero values. Which type does the above time series lean towards?


A: Stationary
B: Periodic
C: Sparse
D: Unable to determine

Assistant: Answer: C
