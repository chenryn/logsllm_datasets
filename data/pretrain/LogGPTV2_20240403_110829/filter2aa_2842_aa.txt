“Data” and “Document” are sometimes, 
but not always interchangeably used 
by lawyers and legislators.
We will use these working definitions:
•
Data: the lowest level of abstraction 
from which information and knowledge 
are derived. IE: Bytes arranged in order.
•
Document: a bounded physical 
representation of body of information 
designed with the capacity (and usually 
intent) to communicate.

Living Person (Person in Being) 
or 
Business Organization (Corporate 
Entity)?
•
A company has some legal rights similar to 
a living person
o A company can make contracts as well as sue 
and be sued
o An Agent can “speak” for the business 
organization

Consider the various ways in which the 
law treats data…
…For now, just keep in mind data which

through networks.

All of the above refers to data at rest…
…What happens if the data is in motion?

Ok – that’s all great… you’re not making 
me feel better about my data, but I 
thought this talk was about my mind.
Lets just take a few minutes to tease 
apart what you mean when you talk 
about the difference between your 
stored data and your mind.

Before we launch in though – here’s a piece 
of historical case law to think about…
The contents of your desk/briefcase/valise 
– your “Personal Notes and Effects” have 
some protections…
How does that fall apart in this brave new 
world.
Where do you keep your memory?

Pretend it’s still the ’90s.
1990's PDA - "Assistant" -- names, addresses, 
phone numbers, relationships (PII of 
others), your PII+aspirations, future 
events, plans, etc.
Are we talking about “thoughts”/”memories”
or personal notes and effects?
Are alarm settings legally an agent?

Pretend it’s finally the early 00’s.
Connected PDA – same as previous case 
but has some replicated data-stores.
The replicated copies are held by a 
corporation – is there an agency 
relationship?
Does the corporation have rights to your 
memory / knowledge?

What about when the memory is not ‘to 
remember something’ – but rather ‘to 
do some action’?
How about a cron job or scheduled task?
Google Search Alerts?
This is less about data and more about 
agency.
