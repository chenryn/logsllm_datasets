This search will not catch even' possible way to post a phone number. For example, if the user had typed "314 
555 twelve twelve", the above technique would not work. The researcher must consider the alternative ways that 
a target will post a number on a website. It may help to imagine how you would post the target number creatively 
on a site, and then search for that method. Additionally, searching for only a portion of the number may provide 
results. You may want to try searching only die last four digits of the number. This may produce many unwanted 
results, but your target may be within the haystack. An automated option is included in the search tools.
Most grocerv chains have adopted a reward/loyalty card system that mandates die participant to enroll in dieir 
program. The consumer completes an application and receives a plastic card to use during checkout for 
discounts. Manv of these stores only offer a sale price if you are a member in the program. Most consumers 
provide a cellular telephone number to the program and use that number during checkout. This eliminates the 
need of possessing a physical card in order to receive die discount. Instead, they type their cell number into the 
card swiping machine to associate the purchase with dieir membership. These programs contain a huge database 
of telephone numbers and the registered users. There is no online database to access diis data. However, you 
can obtain this data if you are creative.
This list can get quite long if you try to search every possible search format. One search that will cover most of 
these searches in a single search attempt would look like the following.

as well as the spammers. This can make searching difficult for an analyst. The hard way to do this is to conduct 
several searches similar to the following.
The "|" symbol in this search is the same as telling Google "OR". In essence, we are telling Google to search 
"314" or "three one four", then "555" or "five five five", and then "1212" or "one two one two". With thi- 
search, you would receive a result if any combination of the following was used.
Assume your target telephone number is 847-867-5309. If you have tried even’ technique mentioned at this 
point to identify the owner and failed, you may consider a query with a local grocery chain. The easiest method 
is to enter the store, purchase a pack of gum, and enter the target telephone number as the reward/loyalty 
program number. You will likely receive a receipt with the target's name on the bottom. Figure 18.02 (left) 
displays a portion of the actual receipt that I received when using this number. If you prefer to avoid entering a 
store, drive to the company's gas station outside of the store. Figure 18.02 (right) displays the notification I 
received when entering this same number at the pump. Note that this number is fictional. However, it has been 
registered at practically every grocery store in the United States. Tty to use it the next time you make a purchase.

my applicable application,
I mentioned this technique previously during the Android emulation chapter. If 1 receive 
information about a target telephone number with the previous options, 1 proceed to t 
add the number as a friend named "John" in the contacts of the device. I then open ai 
such as Twitter, Instagram, and dating apps, and ask them to "find my friends". More often than not, an app 
links me to a social network profile which is associated with the only number in my contact list.
As a test, I searched three cellular numbers which were assigned to me when I worked for the government. All 
three returned with positive results displaying "Mike", Michael" and "Bazzel". None of these phones were 
publicly attached to my name until someone shared their contact details with the world. While it is a nuisance 
to open an Android VM each time 1 need to conduct a search, the results from Calls.ai, Truecaller, and others 
justifies the time.
This Android application is impressive. It queries a large database of crowd-sourced contact details from 
unknown sources. Most telephone number search results reveal only a first name,

accurate. Conduct the following to use this app.
If you have any suspicion that the target of your investigation is involved in prostitution, drugs, or any related 
activity, Escort Index should be checked against the telephone number of your subject. This website aggregates 
all of the prostitution classifieds and review sites into one search. It extracts the telephone numbers from all 
online classified pages and allows you to search by the target telephone number. One of my training examples 
identified 37 online photos, 20 escort ads, several reviews by "Johns", ages used by the target, the last known 
location, and locations visited based on postings in online classifieds. Any time 1 have a target telephone number 
that is likely involved in criminal activity, 1 conduct a brief search on this site.
Real World Application: In 2019,1 was asked to assist an attorney in a child custody and divorce case. He 
prodded the cellular telephone numbers of the suspected cheating husband and an unknown number of a 
potential mistress identified from telephone records. 1 added both numbers to the contacts list in my Android 
emulator and checked every app daily. This method identified a dating profile which included the husband s 
photo, but with a different name. On the same day which he was served divorce papers, I observed both 
numbers show up in the encrypted communications app Signal. While it did not identify the person on the other 
end of the communication, the coincidence of the two numbers joining Signal on the same day is revealing. 
While writing this chapter, I successfully identified the owner of a "burner" number because he connected it to 
his WhatsApp account. I added the number to my Contacts within my Android emulator; Opened WhatsApp; 
and asked it to find any "friends". It immediately displayed an image of a face associated with the number. A 
reverse image search (explained later) identified a social network in my target's true name. 1 have also used this 
technique to identify Skype profiles associated with a cellular number.
