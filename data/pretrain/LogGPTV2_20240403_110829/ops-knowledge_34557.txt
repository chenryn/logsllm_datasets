### Summary of the Log Chunk

The provided log chunk, spanning from 18:09:29 to 18:09:34 on October 18, indicates several recurring issues within the Hadoop environment:

1. **Address Changes**:
   - Multiple address changes are detected for two different ports (8030 and 9000) on the server `msra-sa-41`. The old addresses include the IP `10.190.173.170`, while the new addresses use the hostname `msra-sa-41` without the IP.

2. **Lease Renewal Failures**:
   - The `LeaseRenewer` component is failing to renew the lease for `DFSClient_NONMAPREDUCE_1537864556_1`. This failure occurs repeatedly, with the duration increasing from 272 seconds to 276 seconds over the span of the log. The system indicates that it will retry the lease renewal shortly after each failure.

3. **Connection Retries to Resource Manager (RM)**:
   - The `RMCommunicator Allocator` is attempting to connect to the server at `msra-sa-41:8030`. It retries the connection multiple times, using a retry policy of `RetryUpToMaximumCountWithFixedSleep` with a maximum of 10 retries and a sleep time of 1000 milliseconds between each attempt.
   - Each retry attempt results in an error, specifically `ERROR IN CONTACTING RM`.

### Detailed Breakdown

- **Timestamps and Components**:
  - The log entries are timestamped from 18:09:29 to 18:09:34, indicating a very short time frame.
  - The components involved are `RMCommunicator Allocator`, `LeaseRenewer`, and `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`.
  - The relevant software components are `org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client`, `org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.LeaseRenewer`, and `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerAllocator`.

- **Recurring Patterns**:
  - The address change warnings and lease renewal failures occur every second, suggesting a consistent issue with the network or configuration.
  - The connection retries to the RM also occur every second, with the system attempting to reconnect but failing each time.

### Conclusion

The log indicates a series of network and configuration issues, including address changes and failed lease renewals, which are causing the system to repeatedly attempt to connect to the Resource Manager. These issues need to be addressed to ensure stable operation of the Hadoop cluster.
