User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Syslog forwarding loses original hostname I have DMZ hosts forwarding to a DMZ syslog which in turn forwards all the syslog messages to an internal syslog server. It's working fine for the most part but the internal syslog host messages appear to all be coming from the DMZ syslog ie it loses the original hostnames.

{Hosts} -> {DMZ syslog: openbsd: syslog v 1.17} -> {Internal Syslog: rsyslog v3}

How can I preserve the hostnames?

Thanks!

Assistant: Configure /etc/rsyslog.conf to preserve the FQDN: $PreserveFQDN on
