Comparison We compare our results with the related ones for the high-latency networks (such as the Internet)
in the honest majority setting. The most relevant is that of [MRZ15] and we elaborate on the comparison with
it below. With regard to the 4-party protocol of [IKKP15], it is expected to lag in performance compared to
g4PC since its computation and communication is signiﬁcantly higher. As per our calculations, the overhead
of transmitting 12 GCs instead of 1 is more than the efﬁciency gain of having 2 rounds instead of 5, even with
bandwidth of 100Mbps for our benchmark circuits of SHA-256 and MD5. In case of limited bandwidth of around
8Mbps, our protocol would perform better than that of [IKKP15] for all our benchmark circuits including AES.
The difference in performance will be even more signiﬁcant for larger circuits or when multiple MPC executions
are run in parallel. Another work close to our setting is that of [CGMV17] that explores 5PC in the honest majority
setting. Similar to [MRZ15], it only provides selective abort. It uses distributed garbling and requires 8 rounds. Our
3 party and 4 party protocols perform better than the protocol of [CGMV17], in spite of achieving better security
notions of fairness and guaranteed output delivery. The total communication for any of our protocol constitutes
only 1 - 3.5 % of the total communication of their implementation in the malicious setting and 3 - 6 % of the total
communication of their implementation in the semi-honest setting.
For comparing with [MRZ15], four parameters are considered– computation time (CT), communication cost
(CC) and runtime both in LAN (LAN) and WAN (WAN). The LAN and WAN runtime are computed by adding
the computation time and the corresponding network time. Noting that the roles of the parties in the protocols are
asymmetric, we show the computation time, LAN and WAN runtime and communication cost separately for the
parties with distinct roles. The trend of WAN runtime across the tables indicates the inﬂuence of round complexity
and the location of servers. For a fair comparison with our protocols, we instantiate the protocol of [MRZ15] in
our environment and the results appear in Table 1. The results for our 3PC with fairness, 4PC (5 rounds) and 3PC
with guaranteed output delivery appear in Tables 2, 3 and 4 respectively. With respect to our 4-round 4PC with
god, in the worst case run, we save a round at the expense of one garbled circuit over our 5-round 4PC which
