User: I am installing Celery through Puppet and I would like to also have a default configuration file to provide to Celery. The default name is celeryconfig.py, but I don't know where to copy it.
I am NOT using Celery with Django.
What is the location where I should copy celeryconfig.py in order for Celery to read it everytime it runs?
Assistant: I prefer put configs to project root folder:

One easy style to load config.
One easy style to find and edit config.

However you should load configs manually with one of next methods: config_from_object, config_from_envvar or config_from_cmdline.
