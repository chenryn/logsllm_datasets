User: Not a major issue but just an annoyance I've come upon while doing class work. I have my Notepad++ set up to run Python code straight from Notepad++ but I've noticed when trying to access files I have to use the full path to the file even given the source text file is in the same folder as the Python program being run.
However, when running my Python program through cmd I can just type in the specific file name sans the entire path.
Does anyone have a short answer as to why this might be or maybe how to reconfigure Notepad++?
Thanks in advance.
Assistant: In the properties of the shortcut that you use to start Notepad++, you can change its working directory, to whichever directory you're more accustomed to starting from in Python. You can also begin your python program with the appropriate os.chdir() command.
