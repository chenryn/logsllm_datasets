User: Spinning off from another thread, when is it appropriate to use os.system() to issue commands like rm -rf, cd, make, xterm, ls ?
Considering there are analog versions of the above commands (except make and xterm), I'm assuming it's safer to use these built-in python commands instead of using os.system()
Any thoughts? I'd love to hear them.
Assistant: The only time that os.system might be appropriate is for a quick-and-dirty solution for a non-production script or some kind of testing.  Otherwise, it is best to use built-in functions.
