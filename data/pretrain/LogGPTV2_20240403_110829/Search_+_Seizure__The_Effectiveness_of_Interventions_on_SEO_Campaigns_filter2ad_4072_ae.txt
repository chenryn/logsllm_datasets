ber of doorways and the campaign’s efﬁcacy in poisoning search
results. For example, as shown in Figure 2b, MOONKIS poisoned
search results for Beats By Dre from the start of 2014 onwards with
95 doorways, while two larger campaigns, JSUS and NEWSORG,
used 439 and 926 doorways, respectively, in the same time period.
The operators of the campaigns successfully SEO their doorways
in concentrated time periods. Although we observe campaigns poi-
soning search results for multiple months, their SEO effectiveness
varies over time as exempliﬁed by the campaigns targeting Beats
By Dre in Figure 2b. To capture this notion of bursty SEO be-
havior, we compute a “peak range” for each campaign deﬁned as
the shortest contiguous time span that includes 60% or more of all
PSRs from the campaign. For example, NEWSORG’s peak range
lasts 24 days from November 23 to December 17, 2013, with a
daily average of 1676 PSRs during this span. Table 2 summarizes
the peak duration in terms of number of days for each campaign.
Using this metric, we ﬁnd campaigns run at their peak for 51.3 days
on average.
The campaign operators also run a diversiﬁed business that gives
them ﬂexibility in the face of disruption. A single campaign, for
example, will use its doorways to poison search results from multi-
ple verticals simultaneously. For instance, the MSVALIDATE and
BIGLOVE campaigns both successfully poison search results for
Louis Vuitton (Figure 2c) and Uggs (Figure 2d). As a result, cam-
paigns possess multiple revenue streams, giving them ﬂexibility
in the event a setback disrupts one revenue stream (e.g., domain
seizures from one brand, problems with a supplier for Beats By Dre
headphones, etc.). The campaign can adjust and continue monetiz-
ing trafﬁc by simply reallocating resources towards stores selling
counterfeit merchandise from other verticals.
Moreover, campaigns often operate multiple storefronts target-
ing the same vertical and selling the same merchandise. Sometimes
the goal is to localize for a market, such as a Japanese Uggs store-
front catering to Japanese consumers. More often, though, these
redundant stores can serve as backups in the event of interventions,
which we explore further in Section 5.3.
5.2 Search Engine Interventions
Since poisoned search results manipulate and degrade user ex-
perience, search engines have an incentive to identify and penalize
PSRs used by the SEO campaigns that lead users to counterfeit
sites. Two options available to search engines for reacting to PSRs
are to demote them in search rank, and to add warning labels to
search results to alert users before clicking through.
Search Result Demotion
5.2.1
Figure 4 shows the prevalence of poisoned search results for four
SEO campaigns over time, and the corresponding order activity at
storefront sites gleaned from creating test orders as described in
Section 4.3.1. The bottom two rows of graphs show the number of
PSRs per day for each SEO campaign: the lowest row focuses on
PSRs in just the top 10 search results, and the row above focuses
on the full top 100 search results. The dark portion of the bars at
the bottoms of the graphs corresponds to PSRs labeled by Google
as “hacked”.
The top two rows show the results of sampling order numbers
from a handful of representative stores promoted by each cam-
paign; the stores that are both visible in PSRs and have high or-
der activity relative to other stores from within the same campaign.
The top “Volume” row shows the actual samples over time for the
handful of representative stores and reﬂects the combined cumu-
lative volume of order numbers created (recall that these numbers
are an upper bound of actual orders made by customers). As an-
other way of looking at the same data, the lower “Rate” row shows
the order data as a histogram: we bin the number of estimated or-
ders per week, interpolating in regions where we lack samples. The
number at the top of each graph is the maximum value across the
time series.
In all four campaigns, we see correlation between PSR preva-
lence and order activity, which suggests that search penalizations
can be effective. This is most evidedent with the KEY campaign.
The rate of orders (slope of the line in the “volume” graph) de-
creases in mid-December, soon after its PSR activity drops pre-
cipitously. We do not know the actual cause of the drop in PSRs:
whether the KEY campaign stopped actively performing SEO on its
doorway sites, Google aggressively demoted its doorways in search
result rank, or the “hacked” warning added to its PSRs dissuaded
users from clicking on search results. However, it appears that the
penalization pressure from Google—demoting most of the PSRs
out of the top 100 and labeling half of the remaining as hacked—
did have an effect. From attempts to actually purchase items, the
stores promoted by the KEY campaign stopped processing orders
after the drop in PSRs.
Penalizing PSRs by demoting them in search rank follows the
conventional SEO wisdom that highly-ranked results are by far the
367Figure 4: Correlation between a store’s visibility in PSRs and order activity for four SEO campaigns. Each column of graphs is associated
with an SEO campaign. Bottom two rows of graphs depict the prevalence of PSRs among the top 100 and top 10 search results, respectively.

most valuable. On this topic, the bottom two rows of Figure 4
show the prevalence of PSRs in the top 10 and top 100 results.
For the most part, the shapes of both histograms are similar: cam-
paigns are successful in SEOing poisoned search results through-
out search page ranks, and it is difﬁcult to conclude whether order
volumes seen at stores are primarily due to the much smaller num-
ber in the top 10 or the much larger number across the top 100.
One example, though, suggests that there is value in having PSRs
across the full top 100. For the MOONKIS campaign, during most
of March 2014 it had negligible PSRs in the top 10 but hundreds in
the top 100. Nonetheless, order volumes seen at its stores remained
high and steady. In this instance at least, search rank penalization
would need to be even more aggressive to demote the PSRs from
the top 100.
5.2.2 Warning Labels
Google uses the “hacked” label on search results to warn users
about suspicious sites. This form of intervention faces two key
challenges—coverage and reaction time—and, based upon our cra-
wling results, overall appears to be ineffective for this type of abu-
sive SEO activity.
Although most doorways are hacked sites, Google only penalizes
2.5% of the PSRs we crawled with a “hacked” label. From the
perspective of brands, Figure 2 showed that penalized PSRs labeled
with the “hacked” warning were a small fraction of all PSRs at any
point in time for four large brand verticals. From the perspective
of campaigns, Figure 4 shows a similar result: except for the KEY
campaign, both the absolute number and fraction of penalized PSRs
are quite small.
One issue that undermines coverage is that Google only labels
the root of a Web site as “hacked”, and does not label search results
that link to sub-pages within the same root domain. In the PSR data
set, we found 68,193 “hacked” search results. When counting the
number of PSRs that share the same root as a penalized site, Google
could have labeled 102,104 search results (an additional 49%).
A second challenge is reaction time. A key metric of any reac-
tive intervention is the time delay between when a campaign starts
SEOing a doorway and when the search provider detects and pe-
nalizes the doorway with a label. This delta represents the window
of opportunity for an SEO campaign to monetize trafﬁc obtained
through PSRs without any warnings to users.
For doorways penalized with a label, campaigns have multiple
weeks in which to monetize trafﬁc through PSRs. Of the 1,282
“hacked” doorways in the PSRs data, 588 doorways were already
labeled when we ﬁrst saw them and we cannot determine when
they were ﬁrst labeled. The remaining 694 have lifetimes between
13–32 days on average until Google labeled them as “hacked”.
Note that the variance in the lifetime is due to the difﬁculty in
determining exactly when Google penalizes a site. Using crawled
search results, we know when we last saw a doorway prior to the

penalty and when we ﬁrst saw a doorway after the penalty. How-
ever we cannot always determine when the penalty occurred be-
cause it may be the case the doorway does not appear in our results
for an extended period of time. As a result, we present two num-
bers, the smaller of which is the lifetime ending when we last saw
the doorway actively redirecting, while the larger number is the
lifetime when we ﬁrst observed the labeling.
5.2.3 User Trafﬁc
The correlation between search result visibility and order vol-
ume, observed in Figure 4, is an indirect measure of the ability
of campaigns to attract and convert trafﬁc via PSRs. Combin-
ing the AWStats data described in Section 4.4 with the crawled
data and test purchases, we are able to examine this relationship
in greater detail with a case study of a counterfeit Chanel store
run by the BIGLOVE campaign that rotates across three storefront
domains over time (cocoviphandbags.com, cocovipbags.com,
and cocolovebags.com).
As above, in Figure 5 we present both the prevalence of PSRs
attributable to this store and the corresponding extrapolated order
activity from June 10, 2014 to August 31, 2014. Using the AWStats
data, in the bottom-most graph we also present the daily user trafﬁc
seen by the store in terms of the number of HTML pages fetched
by users each day. We use color gradients in the PSRs and trafﬁc
graphs of Figure 5 to distinguish separate instances of coco*.com,
where each instance represents a different domain name used for
the storefront. As seen by the change in gradients, the BIGLOVE
campaign rotated domains for this storefront twice, at the end of
June and the middle of August, updating its doorways found in
PSRs to redirect to the new instances. We see similar changes in
trafﬁc coinciding with each of the domain name changes.
Although there is not sufﬁcient evidence to discern the cam-
paign’s intent, one possibility is that these domain name changes
are a proactive countermeasure against domain name seizures. As
discussed in Section 3.2.2, luxury brand holders frequently seize
domain names to curtail counterfeit sales. However, as we will
show in Section 5.3, SEO campaigns are well aware of the ongoing
seizures and oftentimes react within days of the initial seizure by
simply redirecting to another domain. And being proactive ensures
that there is no downtime: the ﬁrst domain cocoviphandbags.
com was seized on July 11, yet by that time the doorways were al-
ready redirecting users to the second domain cocovipbags.com.
Inspecting the detailed user trafﬁc data from AWStats, we make
rough estimates on conversion metrics from coco*.com that are
consistent with those reported by marketers [4]. During the months
of July and August 2014, coco*.com combined received 93,509
visits, 60% of which properly set the HTTP referrer header.5 Ex-
tracting the referrers reveals the complete set of doorways supply-

including transitioning from HTTPS to HTTP, visiting through an
email client, visiting through a proxy that strips the header, or sim-
ply typing the URL directly into the browser.

ing trafﬁc for this store, and we ﬁnd 83 out of 174 doorway domains
(47.7%) were seen in our crawled PSRs data (recall that we limit
the number of terms we search for a given vertical, and so it is not
surprising that we do not capture all doorways). Examining user
visits more closely, we ﬁnd each visit generates 5.6 HTML page
fetches on average. And when combining the trafﬁc data with the
order data from test purchases, we estimate this store had a 0.7%
conversion rate, roughly a sale every 151 visits.

As discussed in Section 3.2.2, brands have the most incentive for
undermining online counterfeiters, and a highly visible intervention
they can use is to seize the domains of counterfeit storefronts. With
this intervention, brands use legal means to seize domain names of
stores violating brand holder trademarks, thereby preventing users
from visiting sites selling counterfeit merchandise.6
We use two sources of data for studying domain seizure by brand
holders. The ﬁrst is the set of PSRs from our crawled search data.
Mechanistically, it is straightforward to determine whether a store
is seized by checking whether the site redirects users to a serving
notice provided by one of the third-party brand protection services
(e.g., Greer, Burns & Crain [10], SMGPA [33]) or the brand holders
themselves. The second is a set of seized domains listed in court
documents embedded in the serving notice pages; these documents
list all domains involved in a seizure, and enable us to obtain a
broader view of domain seizure activity by brand holders spanning
up to two years.
By extracting the brand holders and the timestamps from seizure
notices, we can also infer how brands use brand protection services.
For both GBC and SMGPA, we ﬁnd brand holders initiate domain
name seizures on a periodic basis, typically on the order of months
between rounds of seizures. Although a handful of brands seized
domains more frequently—Oakley issued 6 court cases at monthly
intervals, Uggs issued 19 court cases at bi-weekly intervals, and
Chanel issued 18 court cases also at bi-weekly intervals—they tend
to be the exception.
To assess the completeness of observing domain seizures using
PSRs, we compared the court cases seen in PSRs against ground
truth we collected by enumerating all court orders from GBC, which
are publicly available through their Web site. During the time frame
of our study (November 2013 to July 2014), we observe 47 cases in
PSRs out of the 50 total cases initiated by GBC (94%) during the
same time frame. This overlap indicates that our crawled search
data captures the bulk of seizure activity by brand holders.
5.3.1 Coverage
Brand holders have been aggressive in seizing storefront domains.
Table 3 shows a breakdown of seized domains across brands, store-
fronts, and campaigns. From manually examining the court docu-
ments embedded in seizure notice pages, brands arranged to have
almost 40,000 domains seized over two years. Speciﬁcally, while
