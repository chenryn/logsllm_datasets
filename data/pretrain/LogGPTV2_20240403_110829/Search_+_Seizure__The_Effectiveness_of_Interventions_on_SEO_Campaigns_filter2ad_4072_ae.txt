### Table 2: Classification of Campaigns and Their Metrics

Table 2 summarizes the classified campaigns, including the number of doorways observed redirecting on behalf of a specific campaign, the number of stores monetizing traffic from the campaign, the number of brands whose trademarks are abused by the campaign, and the peak duration in days for campaigns with 25 or more doorways.

### Relationship Between Number of Doorways and Campaign Efficacy

The number of doorways used by a campaign is often indicative of its effectiveness in poisoning search results. For example, as shown in Figure 2b, the MOONKIS campaign poisoned search results for "Beats By Dre" starting from early 2014 using 95 doorways. In contrast, two larger campaigns, JSUS and NEWSORG, used 439 and 926 doorways, respectively, over the same period. The operators of these campaigns successfully optimize their doorways during concentrated time periods, leading to varying levels of SEO effectiveness over time. This is exemplified by the campaigns targeting "Beats By Dre" in Figure 2b.

To capture the bursty nature of SEO behavior, we define a "peak range" for each campaign as the shortest contiguous time span that includes 60% or more of all poisoned search results (PSRs) from the campaign. For instance, NEWSORG's peak range lasted 24 days from November 23 to December 17, 2013, with an average of 1,676 PSRs per day during this period. On average, campaigns run at their peak for 51.3 days.

### Diversified Business Models for Flexibility

Campaign operators also diversify their business models to ensure flexibility in the face of disruptions. A single campaign may use its doorways to poison search results across multiple verticals simultaneously. For example, both the MSVALIDATE and BIGLOVE campaigns successfully poisoned search results for "Louis Vuitton" (Figure 2c) and "Uggs" (Figure 2d). This diversification provides multiple revenue streams, allowing the campaign to continue monetizing traffic even if one stream is disrupted (e.g., domain seizures, supplier issues).

Additionally, campaigns often operate multiple storefronts targeting the same vertical and selling the same merchandise. These redundant stores can serve as backups in case of interventions, which we explore further in Section 5.3.

### 5.2 Search Engine Interventions

#### 5.2.1 Search Result Demotion

Since poisoned search results degrade user experience, search engines have an incentive to identify and penalize PSRs that lead users to counterfeit sites. One common intervention is to demote PSRs in search rankings. Figure 4 shows the prevalence of PSRs for four SEO campaigns over time and the corresponding order activity at storefront sites, as determined by creating test orders (Section 4.3.1).

The bottom two rows of graphs in Figure 4 depict the number of PSRs per day for each campaign, focusing on the top 10 and top 100 search results. The dark portion of the bars represents PSRs labeled by Google as "hacked."

The top two rows show the order activity for a handful of representative stores promoted by each campaign. The "Volume" row reflects the cumulative volume of order numbers created, while the "Rate" row shows the order data as a histogram, binned by the number of estimated orders per week.

In all four campaigns, there is a correlation between PSR prevalence and order activity, suggesting that search penalizations can be effective. This is most evident in the KEY campaign, where the rate of orders decreased in mid-December, shortly after a significant drop in PSR activity. The cause of the drop is unknown, but it appears that Google's penalization—demoting most PSRs out of the top 100 and labeling half of the remaining as hacked—had an impact. After the drop in PSRs, the stores promoted by the KEY campaign stopped processing orders.

#### 5.2.2 Warning Labels

Google uses the "hacked" label to warn users about suspicious sites. However, this form of intervention faces challenges in coverage and reaction time. Based on our crawling results, it appears to be ineffective for abusive SEO activities.

Although most doorways are hacked sites, only 2.5% of the PSRs we crawled were labeled with the "hacked" warning. From the perspective of brands, Figure 2 shows that penalized PSRs labeled with the "hacked" warning were a small fraction of all PSRs at any point in time for four large brand verticals. Similarly, Figure 4 shows that, except for the KEY campaign, the absolute number and fraction of penalized PSRs are quite small.

One issue undermining coverage is that Google only labels the root of a website as "hacked," not individual sub-pages. In our PSR dataset, we found 68,193 "hacked" search results. If Google had labeled all sub-pages within the same root domain, it could have labeled an additional 49% of PSRs.

A second challenge is reaction time. The key metric is the delay between when a campaign starts SEOing a doorway and when the search provider detects and penalizes it. For doorways labeled as "hacked," campaigns have multiple weeks to monetize traffic through PSRs. Of the 1,282 "hacked" doorways, 588 were already labeled when first observed, and the remaining 694 had lifetimes ranging from 13 to 32 days before being labeled.

#### 5.2.3 User Traffic

The correlation between search result visibility and order volume, as seen in Figure 4, indirectly measures the ability of campaigns to attract and convert traffic via PSRs. Combining AWStats data (Section 4.4) with crawled data and test purchases, we can examine this relationship in greater detail with a case study of a counterfeit Chanel store run by the BIGLOVE campaign, which rotates across three storefront domains (cocoviphandbags.com, cocovipbags.com, and cocolovebags.com).

Figure 5 presents the prevalence of PSRs attributable to this store and the corresponding extrapolated order activity from June 10, 2014, to August 31, 2014. The bottom graph shows daily user traffic in terms of HTML pages fetched by users. Color gradients in the PSRs and traffic graphs distinguish separate instances of the store, each representing a different domain name. The BIGLOVE campaign rotated domains twice, at the end of June and the middle of August, updating its doorways to redirect to the new instances. Similar changes in traffic coincided with each domain change.

One possible reason for these domain changes is a proactive countermeasure against domain seizures. As discussed in Section 3.2.2, luxury brand holders frequently seize domain names to curtail counterfeit sales. However, SEO campaigns often react within days of a seizure by redirecting to another domain, ensuring no downtime. For example, the first domain, cocoviphandbags.com, was seized on July 11, but by that time, the doorways were already redirecting to cocovipbags.com.

From AWStats data, we estimate conversion metrics for coco*.com. During July and August 2014, coco*.com received 93,509 visits, 60% of which properly set the HTTP referrer header. Extracting referrers revealed 83 out of 174 doorway domains (47.7%) in our crawled PSRs data. Each visit generated an average of 5.6 HTML page fetches. Combining traffic data with order data from test purchases, we estimate a 0.7% conversion rate, roughly a sale every 151 visits.

### 5.3 Domain Seizure Interventions

#### 5.3.1 Coverage

Brand holders have been aggressive in seizing storefront domains. Table 3 breaks down the seized domains across brands, storefronts, and campaigns. From manually examining court documents embedded in seizure notice pages, brands arranged to have almost 40,000 domains seized over two years.
