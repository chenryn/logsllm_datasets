We can identify several categories of rules for packaging applications. Namely,
fact rules, computation rules, inferred knowledge rules, action enabling rules, and
constraint rules (Von Halle, 2001). The following examples describe the several
categories of rules used in dynamic package applications.
Fact rules. A simple fact rule is “renting an AVIS car, class B, costs thirty euros per
day.” This example of a rule has already been given previously with the illustration
of the corresponding modeling in RuleML.
Computation rules. Calculate the price of a dynamic package for a customer by
subtracting any discounts (hotel, car, and flight discounts) from the base fee:
PackagePrice =
BasePrice – HotelDiscount – CarDiscount – FlightDiscount
Inferred knowledge rules. The following rules state than if a customer buys a
travel package which costs more than 5,000 euros, then he/she will have a discount
of 15% on the price of the package minus 3,000 euros.
If PackagePrice > 5000
THEN Discount = 0.15*(PackagePrice–3000)
ELSE Discount = 0.
Action enabling rules. These rules, also called triggers, force dynamic packaging
applications to take some predefined actions on the occurrence of an event. For
example, a customer should be notified if his/her credit card is rejected.
IF rejection of credit card payment
THEN notify customer

Constraint rules. An example of this type of rule designates that the final price of a
dynamic package should always be inferior to the sum of its individual products.
(PackagePrice – Discount) <= sum(Individual travel products)
Dynamic Packaging Engine
The dynamic packaging engine is responsible for reading the rules specifications and
generating valid packages, that is, travel packages that comply with the packaging
rules. The engine relies on linear programming (LP) to generate packages dynami-
cally. LP is a subset of mathematical programming that allows packaging rules to
be represented as linear equations. The LP module makes constrained decisions to
maximize (or minimize) a linear objective function associated with package require-
ments. An example of the decisions the LP module could make is how many days
a traveler can spend in a five star hotel in Lisbon, Portugal, near the ocean, with a
rented car, for 1,500 euros.
Once packaging rules are represented using linear equations, as either the objec-
tive or constraint, an LP can be used to solve very large problems generating an
optimum dynamic package. This means that given an objective function used in the
LP, one can be certain that the best possible dynamic package will be constructed.
The speed and quality of the dynamic package configurations produced by the LP
module allows planners to explore different scenarios with different packaging
prices, number of days a customer wishes to stay at a location, or levels of comfort
provided by a hotel.
Future Trends
Travel agents are faced with changes in the tourism industry that have led to reduced
commission revenues. For example, in 1997, the major United States airlines reduced
the commission rate payable to traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies
from 10% to 8%, and from 8% to 5%, respectively. In addition, as of 1998, many
airlines have implemented a zero commission (Joystar, 2005). Additionally, vacation
providers are expected to follow the airlines and eventually apply zero commissions
(Forrester, 2005). As a result, travel agents have to look for new ways to increase
their profit margins. One way is to acquire tools to offer their own services to dy-
namically package their client’s holiday requirements. This added value will allow
travel agents to earn their margins through a combination of reduced commission
and booking fees. Therefore, dynamic packaging is critical to today’s travel industry;

Developing Dynamic Packaging Applications 
airlines, hotels, tour operators, and travel agencies need to create custom packages
for consumers. The development and implementation of modern dynamic packaging
application is therefore a major concern for the travel industry.
The Semantic Web promises to provide applications for Internet users through the use
of metadata (e.g., RDF and OWL) attached to various information resources on the
Web. In the future, these new technologies associated with the Semantic Web will be
the foundation of “killer apps” providing a higher level of service to overcome the
serious limitations of current Web technology in finding, integrating, understanding,
interpreting, and processing information. This Semantic Web is based on machine
processable semantics of data, enabling information processing via a computer
improving the mechanization for many information processing tasks. Ontologies
are necessary to link formal semantics with real world semantics and applications
are needed to demonstrate how the Semantic Web can become a reality. Due to the
requirements of dynamic packaging applications (e.g., interoperability, integration,
knowledge inferring, and rule management), this type of application represents a
good subject to develop a new breed of systems based on the Semantic Web.
Conclusion
With the growth of the demand for customized tourism itineraries, (online) agencies
seek technology that provides their personnel and clients with the flexibility to put
together unique dynamic packages from a range of alternatives, without having to be
aware of the intricacy of contract rules and pricing issues. The concept of dynamic
packaging is to bundle all the components selected by a traveler to produce one
reservation. Despite where the inventory originates, the package that is created is
treated as one operation and entails only one payment from the customer.
Even though the idea of dynamic packing has to some extent already been imple-
mented by major online travel agencies (for example, Expedia, Travelocity, and
Orbitz), we believe that current dynamic packing applications need to be enhanced
with emerging technologies to facilitate the interoperability and integration of tour-
ism data sources to speed up the time to market response. Previous studies have
shown that the strategic potential of dynamic packaging technologies is currently
limited due to interoperability and integration problems of existing travel informa-
tion systems. In this chapter, we have described a systematic approach to deal with
the lack of travel standards and to enable the data integration of travel data sources
using the latest development on the Semantic Web: semantics and ontologies. We
conclude that for the travel industry the Semantic Web can considerably improve
dynamic packing applications.

Another limitation of current dynamic packing applications is the lack of solution
to adequately manage the rules that govern the dynamic creation of travel packages.
Traditional approaches hard code rules into dynamic packing applications. This
solution does not permit the separation of packaging rules from application code.
As a result, rules cannot be easily changed, managed, shared, or reused to reflect
new business policies since they are hidden in the code. With the use of packaging
rules, business users (i.e., nonprogrammers) can add and modify rules in an imple-
mentation-independent, business rule language. The use of packaging rules defined
using semantic standards, such a RuleML, allows rules to be executed by different
rule engines and therefore shared across the travel industry.
