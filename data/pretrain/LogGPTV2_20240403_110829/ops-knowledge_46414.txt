User: I have both Python 2.7 and 3.4 installed on my Ubuntu 14.04 machine.  I want to install the 'requests' module so it is accessible from Py3.4.
When I issued pip install requests on my terminal cmd line I got back:

"Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): requests in /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages"

How can I direct pip to install requests for 3.4 even though it is already in 2.7?
Assistant: i just reinstalled the pip and it works, but I still wanna know why it happened...
i used the apt-get remove --purge python-pip after I just apt-get install pyhton-pip and it works, but don't ask me why...
