Assistant: Use the lsof command on the Linux system to view the relationship between open files and processes in the current system. The specific commands are as follows: 1. Check the files opened by all processes: ``` lsof ``` 2. Check the files opened by the specified process: ``` lsof -p process number``` 3. Check the files opened by the specified user: ` `` lsof -u user name``` 4. View which processes the specified file is opened by: ``` lsof file name``` 5. Display the process and file name of the open file in a list: ``` lsof -i ` `` 6. Display which processes a certain port is occupied by: ``` lsof -i : port number``` In the above command, the "process number" behind the "-p" parameter can be queried with the `pidof` command, such as : ``` lsof -p $(pidof sshd) ``` It should be noted that using the lsof command requires root or sudo authority to view the file opening status of all processes.
