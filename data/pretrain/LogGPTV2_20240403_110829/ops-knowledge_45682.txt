User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题AWS Route53 - Getting simple metrics such as "number of requests in the last 24hrs" My goal is to get a simple "# of requests per day" value against a Route 53 hosted zone. 

I see no straightforward way to do this. 

I have created the query logging as explained here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/query-logs.html

However this is extensive logging and it's split per global edge server. All I want is "domain example.com was queried 40,000 times in the last 24 hours" and similar metrics. 

Is this possible? The logging seems overkill and I'll have to do quite a bit of parsing through all the subdirs to get that type of sum.

Assistant: Each request to Route53 creates its own log entry, so rather than parsing you should be able to count the log entries in a given log group over time with an empty metric filter.  Amazon docs explain how to do that here.  You can have each hosted zone log to its own log group (to count them separately), or can have some hosted zones log to the same log group (to count them together or to split using metric filters).

In console:

 1. Open the CloudWatch console at
    https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/.
 2. In the navigation pane, choose Logs.
 3. In the contents pane, select a log group, and then choose Create
    Metric Filter.
 4. On the Define Logs Metric Filter screen, leave Filter Pattern blank.
 5. Choose Assign Metric, and then on the Create Metric Filter and
    Assign a Metric screen, for Filter Name, type EventCount.
 6. Under Metric Details, for Metric Namespace, type MyNameSpace.
 7. For Metric Name, type MyAppEventCount.
 8. Choose Show advanced metric settings and confirm that Metric Value
    is 1. This specifies that the count is incremented by 1 for every
    log event.
 9. For Default Value type 0, and then choose Create Filter. Specifying
    a default value ensures that data is reported even during periods
    when no log events occur, preventing spotty metrics where data
    sometimes does not exist.


You can then pull up the data in CloudWatch Metrics and graph it with whatever interval and statistic you like.  In your case, "Sum" with "1 day" intervals should get you a line graph of the total DNS requests per day.
