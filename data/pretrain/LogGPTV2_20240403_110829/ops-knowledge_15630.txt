User: I want to use teamcity as CI for my python project. My project use virtualenv to store project related dependencies. So I create venv folder under project root and put env. related stuff there.
But when I trying to create build step with source venv/bin/activate as custom script - it fails with source: not found, if i creating this step also as command line, but executable file and put source as file and venv/bin/activate as parameter, then it fails with Cannot run process source venv/bin/activate : file not found
How to solve this?
Assistant: Actually I solved it by adding #!/bin/sh at the beggining. :)
Thank you for your answers as well.
