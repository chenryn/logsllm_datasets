Overview – What Can Us Defenders Do?
• Malware Effects
• What did the malware affect?
• Where are all the bad files?
• Did it modify the registry? Processes? Services?
• File Type & Content Identification
• Is this file really a jpeg?
• Compressed or encrypted or packed?
• Steganalysis
• Reversing XOR Encryption
• Others … ???

TOOL: Wrappers
• Wrappers is a small utility to put a bitmap or wave header on any 
arbitrary file
• Essentially disguises a file – it has a valid header
• You can see or hear any file
• Wrappers.exe -f Solitaire.exe -t bmp -s g
• Converts Solitaire.exe into the grayscale image you saw in the intro slide
• We’ll use it for demos

MALWARE EFFECTS
• Before identifying the type of a file, you need to find it
• Malware can 
• modify/add/delete  … 
• files/registry keys/services … 
• After an attack, can you be SURE these modifications are fixed?
• Some malware may look legit and you install them yourself
• Did the uninstall REALLY delete everything?

TOOL: Footprint
• Footprint takes a snapshot of the existing file system, registry, 
running processes, and services
• It can also sort the file listing by size and/or date
• After an attack (or install of an undesired program) take another 
snapshot
• Footprint compares the two and highlights changes

FILE TYPE CHARACTERISTICS
• Malware often disguises itself to reduce chance of detection
• Executable files may be named with different extensions, packed, and/or 
encrypted
• Other files may contain  hidden data
• I’ve often seen a “.dat” or “.bin” file that is actually an executable
• Double-clicking can result in execution, despite the file extension
• Can we easily determine the true data type of a file?

TOOL: Write Bitmap Histogram
• This tool was inspired by Greg Conti’s presentation on visualizing 
network traffic
• Has been extremely useful to me over the years
• Before discussing the tool and some illustrative examples, a little 
MATH
• Said in the same tone as “BLAH!”
• Is required

Statistical Background – Entropy & Histograms
• Entropy is a mathematical measure of the average uncertainty of a 
set of symbols
• Most often we consider bytes, 0 – 255 as the set of symbols we 
care about
• The MAX entropy is log2(#possible symbols)
• For 256 symbols, the max entropy is 8.0000
• For base 32 encoded files (i.e 32 symbols), the maximum entropy is 5.0000
• Guess what the max entropy for base 64 encoded files is???

• If you thought “6.0000” --- Very Good! Gold star for you!

Statistical Background – Entropy & Histograms
• Pj = probability of occurrence of a symbol
• Lg(X) = log2(X)  { 2 to what power = X }
• For byte-sized data, n = 256
• We can estimate the probability by counting (histogram)
• If symbol appears 25 times in 100 byte file, p = 0.25
• Encrypted (random) files have the most uncertainty
• A file with a single value has the least, H = 0 ( log 1 = 0 )

Entropy
Statistical Background – Entropy & Histograms
• Bottom Line: Higher entropy, higher uncertainty
• Compressed: H = 7.6+
• Encrypted:     H = 7.99+
• Text:  H = 4.5 +/-
• The entropy measurement is only accurate with sufficient data
• Can’t get entropy of 7.99+ for a 1-byte encrypted file
• For fairly accurate measurement, need around 4K
• There is research on this, but that’s for another day
• Accuracy increases with increasing data size

Statistical Background – Entropy & Histograms
• A Histogram is a count of the number of occurrences of each symbo
• # ZERO’s in the file shown on the left edge, # 255’s on the right
• At every 16th interval, line is darker
• Extremely useful for analysis of a file’s contents
• Can be used to identify the likely data content of a file
• Many file types have unique histogram characteristics
• Some exceptions
• An image (or audio) of the file is useful too
• Shows position of data file

Fast File Type Identification - Approach
• File Extension
• Not super accurate, but a good start
• Magic Number, Header Validation
• Wrappers kind of defeats this approach
• Visualization
• Audialization (Have you heard this word before?)
• Statistics

What’s in a File?
• We can use entropy, histograms, visualization, and audialization to 
quickly and effectively check:
• Does the file match it’s extension?
• Does it have unusual data?
• Does it have hidden data?
• Is there data tacked onto the end?
• Is it compressed/encrypted?
• Each slide will show an image of the file’s contents and a histogram, 
as well as the estimated entropy

Using the Write Bitmap Histogram Tool
• Run it without any options and usage instructions are printed
• wbh_5.57.exe Novels.txt –b
• Creates a graphical and textual histogram of “Novels.txt”
• The –b option creates the image of the file
• The graphical histogram is scaled, showing relative frequency 
counts
