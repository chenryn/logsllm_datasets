# Fast Forensics Using Simple Statistics & Cool Tools

## What’s All the Fuss About?

### Overview: What Can Defenders Do?
- **Malware Effects:**
  - What did the malware affect?
  - Where are the malicious files located?
  - Did it modify the registry, processes, or services?
- **File Type & Content Identification:**
  - Is this file really a JPEG?
  - Is it compressed, encrypted, or packed?
  - **Steganalysis:**
    - Reversing XOR encryption
    - Other techniques

### Overview: Attacker Tools
- **Executable Packers:**
  - Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (UPX)
- **Encoders:**
  - Base32/64 Encoders
- **Compressors:**
  - 7Zip, Winzip, gzip
- **Encryptors:**
  - Axcrypt
- **Wrappers:**
  - Disguise a file as a bitmap or wave
- **Steganography Tools:**
  - Steg LSB, Steg JPG, and others

### Overview: Defender Tools
- **Hex Editors:**
  - XVI32 (free) and other options
- **Strings:**
  - Extract sequences of characters from a file
- **Footprint:**
  - Snapshot of files, registry entries, processes, and services
- **Write Bitmap Histogram (WBH):**
  - Image and statistical analysis
- **Statistical Analyzer:**
  - Autonomous identification

## Tool: Wrappers
- **Description:**
  - A utility to add a bitmap or wave header to any file.
  - Disguises a file with a valid header.
  - Example: `Wrappers.exe -f Solitaire.exe -t bmp -s g`
  - Converts `Solitaire.exe` into a grayscale image.
  - Useful for demonstrations.

## Tool: Steg LSB
- **Description:**
  - Hides data in the Least Significant Bits of bitmap images.
  - Users can choose the number of bits (e.g., 3 bits/pixel, 5 bits/pixel).

## Tool: Steg JPG
- **Description:**
  - Hides data in the DCT coefficients of JPEG files.
  - Example: Original JPEG vs. 22.45% randomized data embedded.

## Malware Effects
- **Identifying File Types:**
  - Locate and identify affected files.
  - Malware can modify, add, or delete files, registry keys, and services.
  - Ensuring complete removal after an attack.
  - Some malware may appear legitimate and be installed by the user.
  - Verifying if the uninstall process removed all components.

## Tool: Footprint
- **Description:**
  - Takes a snapshot of the file system, registry, running processes, and services.
  - Sorts file listings by size and/or date.
  - Compares snapshots before and after an attack or installation to highlight changes.

### Examples:
- **File Created:**
  - Extra file in directory: `\~Work\Forensics\__Media Files\jpg`
  - Size: 146745 bytes
  - Created: 07/07/2013 06:52:37
  - Modified: 09/13/2003 13:49:04
  - Not found in Dir1: `\jpg`

- **File Deleted:**
  - Extra file in directory: `\~Work\Forensics\Files\IntroSlide`
  - Size: 275590 bytes
  - Created: 07/06/2013 23:33:18
  - Modified: 07/06/2013 23:33:18
  - Not found in Dir2: `\IntroSlide`

- **File Modified:**
  - File property mismatch: `\~Work\Forensics\Files`
  - File size change: 11387 to 11405 bytes
  - Modify date difference: 07/03/2013 23:19:05 to 07/07/2013 06:52:06

## File Type Characteristics
- **Disguising Malware:**
  - Malware often disguises itself to avoid detection.
  - Executable files may have different extensions, be packed, or encrypted.
  - Hidden data in other file types.
  - Example: A `.dat` or `.bin` file that is actually an executable.
  - Double-clicking can execute the file, regardless of the extension.
  - Determining the true data type of a file.

## Tool: Write Bitmap Histogram (WBH)
- **Inspiration:**
  - Inspired by Greg Conti’s presentation on visualizing network traffic.
  - Extremely useful over the years.

### Statistical Background: Entropy & Histograms
- **Entropy:**
  - A mathematical measure of the average uncertainty of a set of symbols.
  - Maximum entropy for 256 symbols: 8.0000
  - Maximum entropy for base 32 encoded files: 5.0000
  - Maximum entropy for base 64 encoded files: 6.0000

- **Histogram:**
  - A count of the number of occurrences of each symbol.
  - Useful for analyzing file contents.
  - Identifies likely data content and unique characteristics of file types.

### Fast File Type Identification
- **Approach:**
  - File Extension: Not very accurate but a good start.
  - Magic Number, Header Validation: Can be defeated by wrappers.
  - Visualization and Audialization: Quick and effective checks.
  - Statistics: Entropy, histograms, and other metrics.

### What’s in a File?
- **Checks:**
  - Does the file match its extension?
  - Does it have unusual data?
  - Does it have hidden data?
  - Is there data tacked onto the end?
  - Is it compressed or encrypted?

### Using the Write Bitmap Histogram Tool
- **Usage:**
  - Run `wbh_5.57.exe Novels.txt –b` to create a graphical and textual histogram.
  - The `-b` option creates an image of the file.
  - Graphical histogram shows relative frequency counts.

### Examples:
- **Text File:**
  - Entropy: 4.48469
- **HTML File:**
  - Entropy: 4.70042
- **24-Bit Full Color Bitmap:**
  - Entropy: 7.63054
