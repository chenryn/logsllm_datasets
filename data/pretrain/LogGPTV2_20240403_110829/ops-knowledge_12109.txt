User: I use Windows 7 and Python IDLE.
I'm trying to use easy_install but gut this error:

Traceback (most recent call last):   File "", line 1, in
  
      easy_install NameError: name 'easy_install' is not defined

In included in my 'Path' the directory where it has been installed (C:\Python27\Scripts).
Any thoughts on what could be wrong?
Maybe...
In Python IDLE > File > Path browser, I cannot see C:\Python27\Scripts. How to add it ?
Assistant: easy_install is an executable program, not a Python script. Run it from the Windows command line, not from Python.
