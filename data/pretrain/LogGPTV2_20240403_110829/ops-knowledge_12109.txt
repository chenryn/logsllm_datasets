I am using Windows 7 and Python IDLE, and I am trying to use `easy_install`. However, I encountered the following error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'easy_install' is not defined
```

I have added the directory where `easy_install` is installed (C:\Python27\Scripts) to my system's `Path` environment variable. Despite this, I still cannot see C:\Python27\Scripts in the Path Browser when I go to File > Path Browser in Python IDLE.

Could you provide any suggestions on what might be going wrong? How can I properly add C:\Python27\Scripts to the Path Browser in Python IDLE?

**Response:**

`easy_install` is an executable program, not a Python script, and it should be run from the Windows command line rather than directly within Python or Python IDLE. To resolve your issue, follow these steps:

1. **Verify the Installation of `easy_install`:** Make sure that `easy_install` is correctly installed in the `C:\Python27\Scripts` directory. You can check for its presence by navigating to this directory and looking for the `easy_install.exe` file.

2. **Update the System Path:**
   - Open the Start Menu, right-click on "Computer," and select "Properties."
   - Click on "Advanced system settings" and then "Environment Variables."
   - In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and select it. Click "Edit."
   - Add `;C:\Python27\Scripts` to the end of the `Path` value, ensuring that there are no duplicate entries.
   - Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.

3. **Restart Your Command Prompt:**
   - Close any open Command Prompt windows and open a new one. This ensures that the updated `Path` variable is recognized.

4. **Run `easy_install` from the Command Line:**
   - Open a Command Prompt window and type:
     ```sh
     easy_install <package_name>
     ```
   - Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the package you want to install.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to verify that the `C:\Python27\Scripts` directory is correctly included in the `Path` variable and that `easy_install.exe` is present in that directory.

Additionally, note that `easy_install` is somewhat outdated, and it is generally recommended to use `pip` for installing Python packages. If `pip` is not already installed, you can install it using `easy_install` with the following command:
```sh
easy_install pip
```

After installing `pip`, you can use it to manage your Python packages more effectively.
