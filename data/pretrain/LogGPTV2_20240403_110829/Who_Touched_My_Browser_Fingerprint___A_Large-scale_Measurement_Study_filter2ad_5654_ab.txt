of false positives and negatives among those browser instances
that do not clear cookies to estimate those that do. Our overall
estimation is that the false negative rate is around 0.3% and the
false positive rate around 0.1%.
Now let us look at the details. First, we estimate false negative
rate, i.e., two browser IDs should be linked together but not. Our
investigation using cookies shows very few abnormal cases, i.e.,
0.5% among all the browser instances in which two browser IDs

having the same cookie. Those cases, mostly due to a client provid-
ing fake user agent strings, are fixed via cookies, but there are 32%
of browser instances that clear cookies (See Section 3.2.1). There-
fore, we estimate that around 0.3% of browser instances among 32%
browser instances may also have such abnormal cookie patterns.
It is worth noting that the cookie representation may sometimes
also introduce false positives. For example, we observe that two
iPads with different hardware features have the same cookie—this
only happens once in our database. After some investigation, we
believe that the user of these two iPads performs an iTunes backup
so that our cookie is automatically transferred from the old iPad
to the new one. In other words, these are indeed two browser
instances.
Second, we estimate false positive rate, i.e., two browser IDs
should be not linked together but actually are. Our methodology
is based on the assumption that if two cookies appear together
and are interleaved with each other in the time axis, this browser
ID should be broken down into two. Note that this is different
from a cookie deletion case, where deleted cookies will never show
up again, or a private browsing, where one cookie persists but
cookies in private browsing behave like deleted ones. There are
0.1% of browser instances with this pattern, thus categorized as
false positives. We manually inspect these 0.1% of browser instances
and think that it may be because users visit our deployment website
using computers with exactly the same configurations, e.g., these
in a computer lab.
3 DATASETS
In this section, we introduce both the raw and dynamics datasets.
Note that per our agreement with the deployment website, we will
share our dataset if other researchers reach out to us and sign a
non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which confirms that (i) their use
of our dataset is constrained in an academic setting, e.g., publishing
academic papers, (ii) they will not release any potential private
information contained in our dataset, and (iii) they will not give
the dataset to any third-party.
3.1 Raw Dataset
We now introduce the raw data: it contains 7,246,618 fingerprints
with 1,586,719 distinct values from 226 countries. Figure 2 shows
the percentage of identifiable browser fingerprint when the size of
anonymous set for each fingerprint increases. When the anonymous
set size is 10, the identifiable browser percentage, including IP city,
region and country as features, for our raw dataset is over 90%.
Note that the identifiable browser percentage with the anonymous
set size as one is relatively low because many browser instances
visit our deployment website more than once, and we will show
detailed breakdown regarding browser instances in later sections.
We also break down the identifiable fingerprint percentage based
on different platforms and browsers in Figure 2. One interesting
finding is that on desktop platform, Firefox is on par with other
browsers in terms of fingerprintability, while Firefox on mobile
platform is the most fingerprintable browser. The reason is that
many mobile users will adopt the default browser, either Safari or
Samsung Browser, in their cellphones. Therefore, the installation of
another browser like Firefox is itself a fingerprintable feature. The

same also applies to Chrome Mobile, which is less fingerprintable
than Firefox Mobile but worse than Safari and Samsung Browser.
We further break down collected raw fingerprints by different
features and show the distinct and unique values in Table 1. The
distinct number means all the possible values for that feature, and
the unique all the values that belong to only one fingerprint. Here
is a brief description of those features below.
• HTTP Headers. HTTP headers contain many fingerprintable
features, such as User-agent, Accept, Encoding and Language.
• Browser Features. Browser features include plugins, timezone,
and support of different new browser functions, such as WebGL,
localStorage, addBehavior (an IE feature), and openDatabase (a
JavaScript-level database).
• OS Features. OS features include installed fonts like Arial, lan-
guages like Japanese and Chinese, and emojis (i.e., part of Canvas
Images in Table 1) like a smiling face. We rely on two side chan-
nels documented by prior works [3] to detect the list of fonts
and installed languages.
• Hardware Features. Hardware features include information
about GPU, audio cards, screen and CPU. Modern browsers pro-
vide some APIs to access hardware information, such as CPU
class (e.g., x86), GPU vendor (e.g., NVIDIA), and audio card in-
formation (e.g., number of channels).
• IP Features.
IP addresses are not included in browser finger-
printing because a user may move a device from places to places.
For the reason of completeness, we abstract some information
from IP addresses, such as IP city, region and country.
• Consistency Features. Consistency features [8] refer to whether
our script can obtain consistent information on a certain feature
via different methods. For example, we can obtain OS and browser
information from both user agent and JavaScript navigator, and
then check the consistency between these two.
Note that the list of fonts collected by JavaScript via a side-
channel is the most fingerprintable among all the features in terms
of distinct and unique values. After that, both user agent and the list
of plugins, especially the latter, also contribute a lot to the overall
fingerprint. The user agent contains many information, such as
platform and browser type, which makes itself a big fingerprintable
vector. As for the plugin list, if a user installs a plugin, it is more
or less unique as compared to those who do not have plugins. It is
