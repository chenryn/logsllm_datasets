User: Please describe DDoS attacks in network security and provide defense measures
Assistant: A DDoS attack refers to an attacker using multiple computers or network devices to send a large amount of legal or illegal traffic to a target server in order to consume network bandwidth and server resources. DDoS attack methods usually include: SYN Flood, ICMP Flood, UDP Flood, HTTP Flood, etc. These means of attack are implemented by saturating the bandwidth or processing resources of the target server or network. The following are commonly used DDoS attack defense measures: 1. Deploy a DDoS firewall to identify and filter attack traffic according to its rule settings. 2. Use reverse proxy service to filter and mitigate attack traffic at the proxy level. 3. Discover and resolve possible security vulnerabilities as early as possible to prevent hackers from attacking them. 4. Use automated tools to quickly respond to and mitigate attacks as they occur, preventing service disruptions. 5. Cooperate with a suitable CDN service provider to provide high-quality protection for the target site, and the undefended traffic will be processed at this level.
