Certainly! Here is a more refined and professional version of the log line template:

**Template:**
```
NIFF: node node-<node_id> has detected an available network connection on network <network_address> via interface alt0
```

**Explanation:**
- `<node_id>`: A placeholder for the specific node identifier (e.g., `46`).
- `<network_address>`: A placeholder for the specific network address (e.g., `5.5.224.0`).

This format clearly identifies the placeholders and provides a brief explanation, making it easier to understand and use.
