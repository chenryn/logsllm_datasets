User: I have a npyscreen program which has set of options and also I have another normal python command line program which interacts with user by asking yes/no question(s) like a wizard.
I want to integrate the normal python command line program in to the npyscreen program, so when user selects a option I want to run this normal python program. I do not want to reimplement the whole normal python command line program into npyscreen.
Is there anyway to do?
I found one function "npyscreen.CallSubShell" but didn't find any example code and much help in the documentation about this function.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Assistant: Thanks for the solution Shan. This works for me. Also as you said, uncommenting curses.endwin() works for scripts that are interactive.
