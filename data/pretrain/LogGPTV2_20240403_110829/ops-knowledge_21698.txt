Certainly! Here is a more polished and coherent version of your text:

I have an `npyscreen` program that provides a set of options. Additionally, I have a standard Python command-line program that interacts with the user by asking yes/no questions, similar to a wizard.

I would like to integrate the standard Python command-line program into the `npyscreen` program. Specifically, when the user selects an option in the `npyscreen` interface, I want to run the standard Python program. I do not want to reimplement the entire command-line program within `npyscreen`.

Is there a way to achieve this?

I found a function called `npyscreen.CallSubShell`, but I couldn't find any example code or detailed documentation on how to use it.

Thank you in advance for any help.

Best regards,
Shan
