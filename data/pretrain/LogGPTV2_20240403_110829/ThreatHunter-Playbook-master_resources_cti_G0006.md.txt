| Linux, macOS, Windows | Discovery | [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1016/) | APT1 used the `ipconfig /all` command to gather network configuration information. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Collection | [Automated Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1119/) | APT1 used a batch script to perform a series of discovery techniques and save the results to a text file. | File monitoring, Data loss prevention, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, Office 365, Azure AD | Discovery | [Account Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1087/) | APT1 used the commands `net localgroup`, `net user`, and `net group` to find accounts on the system. | Azure activity logs, Office 365 account logs, API monitoring, Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, AWS, GCP, Azure | Discovery | [System Network Connections Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1049/) | APT1 used the `net use` command to get a listing of network connections. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Windows | Discovery | [System Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1007/) | APT1 used the commands `net start` and `tasklist` to get a listing of the services on the system. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows, GCP, AWS, Azure | Collection | [Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005/) | APT1 collected files from a local victim. | File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, Windows, macOS | Exfiltration | [Data Compressed](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1002/) | APT1 used RAR to compress files before moving them outside of the victim network. | Binary file metadata, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring |
| Windows, Linux, macOS | Credential Access | [Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003/) | APT1 has been known to use credential dumping. | API monitoring, Process monitoring, PowerShell logs, Process command-line parameters |
| Windows | Lateral Movement | [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1076/) | APT1 is known to have used RDP during operations. | Authentication logs, Netflow/Enclave netflow, Process monitoring |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Execution | [Command-Line Interface](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/) | APT1 used the Windows command shell to execute commands. | Process monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion, Execution | [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064/) | APT1 used batch scripting to automate the execution of commands. | Process monitoring, File monitoring, Process command-line parameters |
| Linux, macOS, Windows | Defense Evasion | [Masquerading](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/) | APT1 used the file name `AcroRD32.exe`, a legitimate process name for Adobe's Acrobat Reader, to masquerade malware. | File monitoring, Process monitoring, Binary file metadata |
| Windows, Office 365 | Collection | [Email Collection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1114/) | APT1 uses two utilities, `GETMAIL` and `MAPIGET`, to steal email. `GETMAIL` extracts emails from archived Outlook `.pst` files, and `MAPIGET` steals email still on Exchange servers that has not yet been archived. | Office 365 trace logs, Mail server, Email gateway, Authentication logs, File monitoring, Process monitoring, Process use of network |
| Windows | Lateral Movement | [Pass the Hash](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1075/) | APT1 is known to have used pass the hash. | Authentication logs |
|  | Establish & Maintain Infrastructure | [Domain Registration Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1326/) | APT1 hijacked FQDNs associated with legitimate websites hosted by hop points. These domains were originally registered for legitimate reasons but were repurposed for malicious use. |  |
|  | Establish & Maintain Infrastructure | [Compromise 3rd Party Infrastructure to Support Delivery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1334/) | APT1 compromised a vast set of 3rd party victim hop points as part of their network infrastructure. |  |
|  | Establish & Maintain Infrastructure | [Dynamic DNS](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1333/) | APT1 used dynamic DNS to register hundreds of FQDNs. |  |
|  | Build Capabilities | [Obtain/Re-use Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1346/) | APT1 used publicly available privilege escalation tools. |  |
|  | Establish & Maintain Infrastructure | [Acquire and/or Use 3rd Party Software Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1330/) | APT1 used third-party email services in the registration of whois records. |  |

This structured format provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the TTPs employed by APT1, facilitating better understanding and detection.
