Question: An e-commerce website selling precious metals quotes prices based on the market value at the time the user logs in. To secure the quoted price, a user must complete the transaction within a set time frame. An attacker attempts to exploit the system by initiating a transaction without completing it, waiting to see if the market price increases, and then finalizing the purchase at the initial lower quote. As a security consultant, which of the following would be effective remediations to prevent this type of exploitation?
"A": "Implement a system that updates the quoted price in real-time throughout the transaction process.",
"B": "Remove all time-dependent features from the website to prevent any form of timing attack.",
"C": "Allow unlimited time for users to complete transactions to prevent attackers from predicting when prices are updated.",
"D": "Introduce random delays in processing times to obscure any potential information leakage through timing analysis."
Answer: AD
