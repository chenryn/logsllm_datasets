ABSTRACT
In this paper, we propose a new practical identity-based
encryption scheme which is suitable for wireless sensor net-
work (WSN). We call it Receiver-Bounded Online/Oﬄine
Identity-based Encryption (RB-OOIBE). It splits the en-
cryption process into two parts – the oﬄine and the on-
line part.
In the oﬄine part, all heavy computations are
done without the knowledge of the receiver’s identity and
the plaintext message. In the online stage, only light com-
putations such as modular operation and symmetric key en-
cryption are required, together with the receiver’s identity
and the plaintext message. Moreover, since each oﬄine ci-
phertext can be re-used for the same receiver, the number
of oﬄine ciphertexts the encrypter holds only conﬁnes the
number of receivers instead of the number of messages to be
encrypted. In this way, a sensor node (with limited computa-
tion power and limited storage) in WSN can send encrypted
data easily: A few oﬄine ciphertexts can be computed in the
manufacturing stage while the online part is light enough for
the sensor to process.
We propose an eﬃcient construction for this new no-
tion. The scheme can be proven selective-ID CCA secure
in the standard model. Compared to previous online/oﬄine
identity-based encryption schemes, our scheme is exempt
from a high storage requirement, which is proportional to
the number of messages to be sent. The improvement is
very signiﬁcant if many messages are sent to few receivers.
INTRODUCTION
1.
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a wireless network com-
posed of a large number of sensor nodes.
In WSNs the
∗
This is the full version of [7]
scarcest resource is energy. For this reason, algorithmic re-
search in WSN mostly focuses on the study and design of en-
ergy aware algorithms for data computation. This problem
becomes harder in the case of security, as most of the security
algorithms are quite heavy. Although symmetric cryptogra-
phy maybe one of the approaches to solve the problem due to
their small computation requirement, key distribution mat-
ter becomes another side eﬀect. Recently, researchers are
trying to apply assymmetric cryptography into WSN envi-
ronment. Solutions include using online/oﬄine algorithms
and stateful public key encryption schemes.
Online/Offline algorithm. “Online/oﬄine” cryptographic
algorithm was ﬁrst introduced by Even, Goldreich and Mi-
cali [8], in the context of digital signature. Under this paradigm,
the signing process can be divided into two phases. The
ﬁrst phase is called oﬄine phase which is executed prior to
the arrival of a message and the second phase is called on-
line phase which is performed after knowing the message.
The online phase should be very fast and require only very
light computation, such as integer multiplication or hashing.
Other heavier computation such as exponentiation should
be avoided in the online phase. This is the basic charac-
teristic of online/oﬄine schemes. In this way, online/oﬄine
schemes are particularly useful for low-power devices such
as smartcard or wireless sensor applications. Those heavy
computations are done in the oﬄine phase which can be car-
ried out by other powerful devices, or even pre-computed by
the manufacturers in the setup stage.
In parallel to online/oﬄine signatures [15, 11, 6, 10], the ﬁrst
online/oﬄine encryption scheme was proposed by Guo, Mu
and Chen [9]. Similar to online/oﬄine signature schemes, all
heavy computations are done in the oﬄine phase, without
knowing the message to be encrypted. In the online phase,
only light computations are executed with the knowledge of
the plaintext. Nevertheless, there is a slight diﬀerence in the
deﬁnition between online/oﬄine signature and encryption
schemes. Let us take a look on the following example. If we
split the encryption process in the same way as the signing
process, it is trivial to separate some standard encryption,
such as ElGamal encryption scheme. In an ElGamal encryp-
′
tion scheme, the sender ﬁrst computes c1 = gr; c
1 = yr for
some randomly generated r where y is the public key of the
1
receiver. This can be considered as the oﬄine phase, as the
message is still yet unknown. After knowing the message,
the sender computes c2 = m·c
′
1. As this part only requires a
multiplication, it can be considered as the online part. The
ciphertext is (c1; c2). However, it is only suitable for the sit-
uation where the sender knows the recipient of the encrypted
message in the oﬄine phase, since the oﬄine phase requires
the knowledge of the public key of the recipient. We are not
interested in this scenario.
Instead, we consider a notion
that allows the knowledge of the recipient is yet unknown in
the oﬄine phase. [9] uses this deﬁnition for their scheme, in
the context of identity-based encryption.
The above online/oﬄine encryption (where the knowledge of
the recipient is unknown in the oﬄine phase) seems useful
in many scenarios. However, it may not be practical enough
to be used in WSN. As the oﬄine information cannot be
re-used, to encrypt every message one needs to execute the
oﬄine encryption process once. For example, if a sensor
node needs to send 1000 encrypted data to the base station
during its lifetime, it needs to store 1000 pieces of oﬄine
information ﬁrst. Due to limited storage capacity inside a
sensor node, it may not be practical. We call such encryption
as message-bounded online/oﬄine encryption (or OOIBE for
short).
Stateful Public key Encryption. Bellare et al. [2] pro-
posed a method to signiﬁcantly speed-up the public key en-
cryption (PKE) by simply allowing a sender to maintain
a “state” that is re-used across diﬀerent encryptions. This
new type of PKE is called stateful PKE. This can greatly
reduce the computation cost for the sender if it wants to en-
crypt messages many times. Moreover, if the sender stores
some more information with respect to the receiver’s pub-
lic key, it may not need any more exponential computation
for encrypting to this receiver. As an eﬃcient construction,
Bellare et al. presented a stateful PKE scheme based on the
Diﬃe-Hellman assumption. Stateful encryption can be used
in WSNs [1] to reduce the computation cost of sensor nodes,
compared with normal public key encryption.
Although stateful public key encryption reduces the compu-
tation cost a lot, the encrypter still needs to perform heavy
computation at least once for each receiver. That limits the
ﬂexibility of its usage. In WSN environment, sometimes a
sensor node may need to send data to diﬀerent recipients,
say, diﬀerent base stations. Thus stateful public key encryp-
tion is not yet a perfect solution.
Identity-Based Cryptosystem. Identity-Based (ID-Based)
Cryptosystem, introduced by Shamir [14], eliminates the ne-
cessity for checking the validity of certiﬁcates in traditional
public key infrastructure (PKI). In an ID-based cryptosys-
tem, public key of each user is easily computable from an
arbitrary string corresponding to this user’s identity (e.g. an
email address, a telephone number, etc.). Using its master
key, a private key generator (PKG) then computes a private
key for each user. This property avoids the requirement of
using certiﬁcates and associates implicitly a public key (i.e.
user identity) to each user within the system. One only
needs to know the recipient’s identity in order to send an
encrypted message to him. It avoids the complicated and
costly certiﬁcate (chain) veriﬁcation for the authentication
purpose.
In contrast, the traditional PKI needs an addi-
tional certiﬁcation veriﬁcation process, which is equivalent
to the computation of two signature veriﬁcations. Identity-
based system is particularly suitable for power constrained
devices such as sensor nodes or smartcards. The absence of
certiﬁcate eliminates the costly certiﬁcate veriﬁcation pro-
cess. In addition, when there is a new node added to the
network, other nodes do not need to have its certiﬁcate ver-
iﬁed in order to communicate in a secure and authenticated
way. This can greatly reduce communication overhead and
computation cost.
Both two message-bounded online/oﬄine encryption schemes
proposed by [9] are in identity-based setting. The ﬁrst scheme
requires 7 pairing operations in the decryption stage. It is
proven secure in the selective-ID model. While for the sec-
ond scheme, it is secure in the full security model, though
the ciphertext is very large (more than 4700 bits). Recently
Liu and Zhou [12] proposed another eﬃcient OOIBE scheme.
The ciphertext is just 1248 bits. However, their scheme can
be only proven secure in the random oracle model. For state-
ful public key encryption, there is only one identity-based
solution [13] which is also proven secure in the random ora-
cle model only.
1.1 Receiver-Bounded Online/Ofﬂine Identity-
Based Encryption
Receiver-Bounded Online/Oﬄine Identity-Based Encryption
(RB-OOIBE) is a practical encryption solution on wireless
sensor nodes. It allows a sensor node to encrypt data with
low computation power and low precomputation storage. Brieﬂy,
the data sender prepares a small number of oﬄine cipher-
texts ﬁrst, say, n. Since computing oﬄine ciphertexts doesn’t
require the receiver’s identity, it can be executed in the man-
ufacturing stage. Then the data sender can enjoy light en-
cryption process on unlimited messages for up to n receivers.
In other words, as long as there are less than n receivers, the
data sender can avoid all heavy computations.
RB-OOIBE gets rid of the shortcomings of online/oﬄine and
stateful encryption. Unlike message-bounded online/oﬄine
encryption, it doesn’t need to prepare a large amount of
oﬄine ciphertexts (one for each encryption). An oﬄine ci-
phertext is dedicated to a receiver instead of a message to
be encrypted. Unlike stateful encryption, the sender of RB-
OOIBE doesn’t need any heavy computation when he en-
crypts messages for up to n diﬀerent receivers.
RB-OOIBE is most suitable for WSNs.
In the WSN en-
vironment, sensitive data are collected and encrypted by a
low-power and low-storage sensor node, and then are sent
back to one of several connected base stations. In general,
lots of sensing data will be sent to the same base station (re-
ceiver). The sensor node may store up to n pieces of oﬄine
part information in the manufacturing stage, so that it can
send unlimited encrypted data to n diﬀerent base stations
without any further heavy computation, while these base
station identities can be unknown to the manufacturer.
Compared with hybrid cryptosystems. A hybrid cryp-
tosystem consists of a public key (or identity-based) cryp-
tosystem and a symmetric key cryptosystem. The sender
ﬁrst encrypts a symmetric key using the receiver’s public key
2
(or identity) and sends it to the receiver so that they can
communicate with each other via the symmetric key cryp-
tosystem. We can see that using hybrid cryptosystems, the
sender has to perform a full public key encryption procedure
before communicating to each receiver. Even the sender uses
OOIBE to encrypt messages, the receiver is not stateless –
it has to keep a key for each sender. Therefore, hybrid cryp-
tosystems are not suitable for a large scale network where 1)
a low-power device has to send data to multiple recipients;
2) a stateless device has to receive data from many other
parties.
1.2 Contribution
In this paper, we propose a new notion of Receiver-Bounded
Online/Oﬄine Identity-Based Encryption (RB-OOIBE). We
provide an eﬃcient construction which can be proven selective-
ID CCA secure in the standard model. The advantage of
our schemes over previous OOIBE schemes is very clear if a
sender sends multiple messages to one recipient. Our scheme
re-uses most of the previous information including the oﬄine
pre-computed data. Only a small oﬄine ciphertext has to
be stored on the sensor node.
In contrast, other OOIBE
schemes require a number of oﬄine information which is
proportional to the number of messages to be encrypted.
The diﬀerence is signiﬁcant if there are lots of messages to
be sent by a sender.
Even for encrypting one message, our scheme is more eﬃ-
cient than all OOIBE schemes in the literature. There were
only three schemes proposed: two of them were proposed by
Guo, Mu and Chen in [9]. We use GMC-1 and GMC-2 to de-
note them respectively. The remaining scheme was proposed
by Liu and Zhou [12]. We use LZ to denote it. When com-
pared to GMC-1 (selective-ID security) and GMC-2 (full se-
curity), our scheme enjoys over 50% improvement in storage
cost and ciphertext size. Even if we compare our schemes
with LZ (which is proven secure only in the random ora-
cle model), our scheme also gains eﬃciency improvement in
storage cost and online computation cost.
Note that we don’t need to care about selective-ID security
here. Usually, there are at most hundreds of base stations
in a wireless sensor network. That means we only need hun-
dreds of identities in the system. The simulator can guess
the attacking identity in advance, and this will not loosen
the security reduction too much in practice.
The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Some mathe-
matical and security deﬁnitions are presented in Section 2.
Our proposed scheme is given in Section 3. In Section 4 we
give a performance comparison with previous schemes and
we conclude the paper in Section 5.
2. DEFINITION
In this section we brieﬂy describe the assumptions and def-
initions of our construction.
2.1 Bilinear Group
Let G and GT be two cyclic groups of prime order p. Let
e : G × G → GT be a map with the following properties:
• Bilinear:
for all g1; g2 ∈ G and a; b ∈ Z, e(ga
1 ; gb
2) =
3
e(g1; g2)ab.
• Non-degenerate: for some g ∈ G, e(g; g) ̸= 1.
We say that G is a bilinear group if the group operations in
G and GT , and the bilinear map are eﬃciently computable.
2.2 Complexity Assumption
Our construction is based on the decision Bilinear Diﬃe-
Hellman (BDH) assumption [5, 3]. the decision BDH prob-
lem in G is that given a tuple g; ga; gb; gc ∈ G and an element
Z ∈ GT , decide if Z = e(g; g)abc.
Deﬁnition 1. The decision BDH assumption holds in G if
no polynomial time algorithm A has non-negligible advan-
tage in solving the Decisional BDH problem. More precisely,
we deﬁne the advantage of A in distinguishing two distribu-
tions as
AdvBDHA;G ((cid:21)) = | Pr[A(1(cid:21); g; ga; gb; gc; e(g; g)abc) = 1]
− Pr[A(1(cid:21); g; ga; gb; gc; R) = 1]|;
where R ∈R GT and the size of group G depends on the
security parameter (cid:21). The decision BDH assumption holds
((cid:21)) = maxA{AdvBDHA;G ((cid:21))} is negligible for
in G if AdvBDHG
any adversary A.
2.3 Building Block
We introduce three building blocks used in our schemes:
• an IND-CCA secure symmetric encryption scheme.
The IND-CCA security of a symmetric encryption scheme
SE=(SEnc, SDec) with key length k is captured by
deﬁning the advantage of an adversary A as
AdvCCAA;SE((cid:21)) = 2 · Pr[(cid:12)
= (cid:12) : K ∈R {0; 1}k;
(cid:12) ∈R {0; 1}; (cid:12)
′
′ ← ASEncK ;SDecK ;ChalK;(cid:12) (1(cid:21))] − 1:
In the above, ChalK;(cid:12)(m0; m1) returns SEncK (m(cid:12)).
Moreover, A is allowed to issue only one query to
the Chal oracle, and is not allowed to query SDecK
on the ciphertext returned by it. The symmetric en-
cryption scheme is IND-CCA secure if AdvCCA
((cid:21)) =
maxA{AdvCCAA;SE((cid:21))} is negligible for any adversary A.
• a collision-resistant hash function.
SE
A hash function H : {0; 1}∗ → Zp is collision-resistant
if no polynomial time adversary A has non-negligible
advantage in ﬁnding collisions on it. More precisely,
we deﬁne the advantage of A as
AdvCOLA;H ((cid:21)) = Pr[H(x1) = H(x2) ∧ x1 ̸= x2 :
(x1; x2) ← A(1(cid:21))];
