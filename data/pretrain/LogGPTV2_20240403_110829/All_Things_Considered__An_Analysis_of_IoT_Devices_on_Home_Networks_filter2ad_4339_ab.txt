### Intersection Analysis with Network Telescope Data

To control for potential DHCP churn, we analyzed the intersection between Censys and Avast data over a 24-hour period on January 30, 2019. Additionally, we examined whether devices that accept weak credentials for authentication present login interfaces on public IP addresses. The results of this analysis are discussed in Section 4.

### 2.6 Ethical Considerations

WiFi Inspector collects data from within users' homes. To ensure that this data is collected in accordance with user expectations, we only gather statistics from homes where the user has explicitly agreed to share data for research purposes. This data sharing agreement is clearly outlined in simple English and not hidden in a lengthy EULA. Figure 1 shows the dialogue where users acknowledge this agreement. It is important to note that this is an explicit opt-out process. The data sharing agreement is the last message shown to the user before the main menu, meaning users do not need to wait or remember to turn off data collection at a later time.

To keep up-to-date information on the devices in a home, WiFi Inspector runs periodic, automated scans of the local network. These automated scans do not perform any vulnerability testing or password weakness checks; they only identify devices through banners and MAC addresses. Our analysis is limited to homes where a user explicitly manually initiated a network scan.

To protect user privacy and minimize risk, Avast shared only aggregated data with our team. This data was aggregated by device manufacturer, region, and device type, with the smallest region containing over 100,000 homes. We never had access to data about individual homes or users, and no personally identifiable information was ever shared with us. Avast did not collect any additional data for this work, nor did they change the retention period of any raw data. No data beyond the aggregates in this paper will be stored long-term.

Internally, Avast adheres to a strict privacy policy: all data is anonymized, and no personally identifiable information is ever shared with external researchers. All handling of WiFi Inspector data complies with personal data protection laws, such as GDPR, and extends to data beyond its territorial scope (i.e., outside of the European Union). Specific identifiers like IP addresses are deleted in accordance with GDPR and are only collected when explicitly necessary for the security function of the product.

### 3. IoT in Homes

Understanding the types of IoT devices that consumers install and their regional distributions is crucial given their increasing security and privacy implications. In this section, we provide one of the first large-scale analyses of these devices based on scans from 15.5 million homes.

#### Regional Variance in IoT Device Presence

The presence of IoT devices varies significantly by region. For example, more than 70% of homes in North America have an IoT device, while fewer than 10% of homes in South Asia do (Figure 2). Media devices (e.g., smart TVs and streaming devices) are the most common type of device in seven out of eleven regions, both in terms of presence in homes (2.5%–42.8%) and total number of devices (16.6%–59.0%). Four regions differ: surveillance devices are most common in South and Southeast Asia, while work appliances are most common in East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Table 4 shows the most popular devices in each region.

Despite differences in IoT popularity across regions, there are strong correlations between regions for the types of devices that are popular. In other words, the most popular types of devices are similar across regions. However, certain pairs of regions differ. For example, homes in all Asian regions are least similar to homes in North America. On the other hand, homes in geographically similar regions (e.g., South Asia and Southeastern Asia) are highly correlated, even when they differ from the global distribution.

To quantify the preference for different types of devices across regions, we used a Spearman’s rank correlation test across each pairwise region, taking the rank-ordered list of device types for each region as input (Table 5). According to Cohen’s guidelines, we found that all regions' rank-ordered distributions are strongly correlated (>0.7 coefficient) with p-values < 0.05, indicating little change in the rank order of device type distributions across regions.

### 3.1 North America

North America has the highest density of IoT devices of any region: 71.8% of homes have an IoT device compared to the global median of 40.2%. Similar to other regions, media devices (e.g., TVs and streaming boxes) and work appliances account for the most devices in North American homes. Nearly half of homes have one media device, and one-third have a work appliance (Table 4). Media devices are also the most prolific, accounting for 44.9% of IoT devices in North America. In contrast, work appliances only account for 28% of devices (Table 4).

There is a long tail of manufacturers that produce media devices in the U.S., and the most popular vendor, Roku, accounts for only 17.4% of media devices (Table 11). The second most popular is Amazon (10.2%). In contrast, there are only a handful of popular work appliance vendors—HP is the most common and accounts for 38.7% of work appliances in North America.

Though popular in every region, a considerably higher number of homes in North America contain a game console. This is one of the reasons that a smaller fraction of IoT devices are media-related than in Western and Northern Europe. There are three major vendors of game consoles: Microsoft (39%), Sony (30%), and Nintendo (20%).

North America is the only region to see significant deployment of home voice assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home. Nearly 10% of homes now have a voice assistant, and the device class accounts for 7.5% of IoT devices in the region. Two-thirds of home assistants are produced by Amazon, and the remaining one-third are Google devices. North America is also one of the only regions to see automation devices, which are present in 2.5% of homes. There are four major manufacturers in this space: Nest (44.2%), Belkin (15.1%), Philips (14.4%), and Ecobee (9.8%). These vendors sell products such as the Nest Thermostat, Wemo smart plug, Philips Hue Smart Lights, and the Ecobee Smart Thermostat.

The relative ranking of IoT device type popularity generally does not change as more IoT devices are added to North American homes. To quantify this, we calculated the Spearman rank correlation for each pairwise set of homes based on the number of devices and observed only slight deviations from the overall regional distribution. As more devices are added to the network, the correlation coefficients for North America hover between 0.98–1.0, indicating minimal change. Despite minimal change in the relative ranking of IoT device types, the fraction of each device type does vary as more IoT devices are added to the home. For example, for homes with one IoT device, voice assistants make up only 3.9% of all devices, down from 7.3% across all homes. Game consoles are also more popular in homes with only one IoT device, up from 13.9% to 16.5%.

### 3.2 Central and South America

South American homes are the least similar to North America of any region (Table 5). While the most common types of IoT devices in both regions are media devices (51.7% vs. 44.9%) and work appliances (24% vs. 28%), significantly fewer South American homes have an IoT device (34% vs. 71%). There are also significantly more surveillance devices: 13.3% vs. 3.7% of devices (Table 4). Prior research has uncovered an increased reliance on surveillance devices in Brazil and surrounding regions to deter violence, which may offer one explanation. The only other device type we commonly see are game consoles (9.8% of devices). No other class appears in more than a fraction of a percent of homes.

The vendor distribution of media devices in Central and South America differs from the global distribution. Two vendors appear in the top 5 for this region that do not appear in any other region. First is Arcadyan, a Taiwanese company that primarily manufactures cable boxes in this category and is often found in LG Smart TVs. The second is Intelbras, a Brazilian company that manufactures DVRs and smart video players. Intelbras accounts for 11% of the surveillance cameras in the region, though they are third to Hikvision and Dahua.

### 3.3 Europe

Eastern and Western Europe are both most similar to Oceania, with strong correlations in the types of IoT devices present.
