to our network telescope data, we investigate the intersec-
tion between Censys and Avast data for a 24-hour period on
January 30, 2019 to control for potential DHCP churn. We
also check whether devices that accept weak credentials for
authentication present login interfaces on public IP addresses.
We discuss the results in Section 4.
2.6 Ethical Considerations
WiFi Inspector collects data from inside users’ homes. To
ensure that this data is collected in line with user expecta-
tions, we only collect statistics about homes where the user
explicitly agreed to share data for research purposes. This
data sharing agreement is not hidden in a EULA, but out-
lined in simple English. We show the dialogue where users
acknowledge this in Figure 1. We note that this is an explicit
opt-out process. The data sharing agreement is the last mes-
sage shown to the user before the main menu, meaning users
do not need to wait and remember to turn off data collection
at a later time.
In order to keep up to date information on the devices
in a home, WiFi Inspector runs periodic, automated scans
of the local network. Automated scans do not perform any
vulnerability testing or password weakness checks; they only
identify devices through banners and MAC addresses. We
limit our analysis to homes where a user explicitly manually
initiated a network scan.
To protect user privacy and minimize risk to users, Avast
only shared aggregate data with our team. This data was
aggregated by device manufacturer, region, and device type.
The smallest region contained over 100,000 homes. We never
had access to data about individual homes or users; no person-
ally identiﬁable information was ever shared with us. Avast
did not collect any additional data for this work, nor did they
change the retention period of any raw data. No data beyond
the aggregates in this paper will be stored long term.
Internally, Avast adheres to a strict privacy policy: all data
is anonymized and no personally identiﬁable information is
ever shared with external researchers. All handling of WiFi
Inspector data satisﬁes personal data protection laws, such
as GDPR, and extends to data beyond its territorial scope
(i.e., outside of the European Union). Speciﬁc identiﬁers like
IP addresses are deleted in accordance with GDPR and only
Figure 2: Devices per Region—There is signiﬁcant variance
in device usage across regions. The largest presence is in
North America, where homes have a median seven hosts.
Conversely, homes in South Asia have a median two hosts.

collected when explicitly necessary for the security function

IoT in Homes
It is vital that the security community understands the types
of IoT devices that consumers install and their respective
regional distributions given their increasing security and pri-
vacy implications. In this section, we provide one of ﬁrst
large-scale analyses of these devices based on scans from
15.5 M homes.
The presence of IoT devices varies by region. For example,
while more than 70% of homes in North America have an
IoT device, fewer than 10% of homes in South Asia do (Fig-
ure 2). Media devices (i.e., smart TVs and streaming devices)
are the most common type of device in seven of the eleven
regions, in terms of both presence in homes (2.5%–42.8%)
and total number of devices (16.6%–59.0%). Four regions
differ: surveillance devices are most common in South and
Southeast Asia, while work appliances are most common in
East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. We show the most popular
devices in each region in Table 4.
Despite differences in IoT popularity across regions, there
are strong correlations between regions for the types of de-
vices that are popular.2 In other words, the most popular types
of devices are similar across regions. Still, certain pairs of
regions differ. For example, homes in all Asian regions are
least similar to homes in North America. On the other hand,
homes in geographically similar regions (e.g., South Asia and
Southeastern Asia) are highly correlated, even when they dif-
fer from the global distribution. The fact that distinct regions
2To quantify the preference for difference types of devices across regions,
we leverage a Spearman’s rank correlation test across each pairwise region,
taking the rank ordered list of device types for each region as input (Table 5).
Per Cohen’s guidelines, we ﬁnd all regions rank ordered distributions are
strongly correlated (>0.7 coefﬁcient) with p-values < 0.05 [11], indicating
little change in the rank order of device type distributions across regions.

Table 4: IoT in Homes—We show the percent of households that have one or more of each type of IoT device and the percent of
devices (in gray) in each region that are of a certain type. For example, 42.8% of homes in North America have at least one
media device and 44.9% of North American IoT devices are media devices. For the presence of any IoT device, we only report
the percent of homes with an IoT device.

Table 5: Regional Similarities—We calculate the similarity
regions by computing the Spearman’s rank correlation test
over each region’s rank order list of most popular types of
devices. We show the most similar region (green) and least
similar region (red) by row. Correlation coefﬁcients presented
are out of 100. In all cases, p-values were < 0.05.
3.1 North America
North America has the highest density of IoT devices of any
region: 71.8% of homes have an IoT device compared to
the global median of 40.2%. Similar to other regions, me-
dia devices (e.g., TVs and streaming boxes) and work appli-
ances account for the most devices in North American homes.
Nearly half of homes have one media device and one third
have a work appliance (Table 4). Media devices are also the
most proliﬁc, accounting for 44.9% of IoT devices in North
America. In contrast, work appliances only account for 28%
of devices (Table 4). There is a long tail of manufacturers
that produce media devices in the U.S., and the most popu-
lar vendor, Roku, only accounts for 17.4% of media devices
(Table 11). Second most popular is Amazon (10.2%). In

type distributions vary between different geographic regions.
For example, Surveillance devices are most prevalent in Asia,
whereas Home Automation devices only appear in North
America and Europe.
have unique preferences for device types points to deeper
differences between regions, making it harder to reason about
IoT in aggregate and more challenging to generalize ﬁndings
from one region to others.
We also considered the relative popularity of types of de-
vices within each region. Even in areas with similar rank
order popularity, the proportion of device types in those re-
gions varies (Figure 3). We compute a pairwise proportion
test across each region to quantify the differences between
regions and ﬁnd that nearly all regions have varying propor-
tions of IoT device types, except when a device type accounts
for fewer than 1% of devices. We discuss each region below.

vendors—HP is the most common and accounts for 38.7% of
work appliances in North America.
Though popular in every region, a considerably higher
number of homes in North America contain a game console.
This is one of the reasons that a smaller fraction of IoT de-
vices are media-related than in Western and Northern Europe.
There are three major vendors of game consoles: Microsoft
(39%), Sony (30%),3 and Nintendo (20%).
North America is the only region to see signiﬁcant deploy-
ment of home voice assistants like Amazon Echo [3] and
Google Home [25]. Nearly 10% of homes now have a voice
assistant and the device class accounts for 7.5% of IoT de-
vices in the region. Two thirds of home assistants are Amazon
produced, the remaining one third are Google devices. North
America is also one of the only region to see automation de-
vices, which are present in 2.5% of homes. There are four
major manufacturers in this space, Nest4 (44.2%), Belkin
(15.1%), Philips (14.4%), and Ecobee (9.8%). These vendors
sell products such as the Nest Thermostat [42], Wemo smart
plug [5], Philips Hue Smart Lights [46], and the Ecobee Smart
Thermostat [19].
The relative ranking of IoT device type popularity generally
does not change as more IoT devices are added to North
American homes. To quantify this, we calculate the Spearman
rank correlation for each pairwise set of homes based on the
number of devices and observe only slight deviations from
the overall regional distribution. As more devices are added
to the network, the correlation coefﬁcients for North America
hover between 0.98–1.0, indicating minimal change. Despite
minimal change in the relative ranking of IoT device types,
we note that the fraction of each device type does vary as more
IoT devices are added to the home. For example, for homes
with one IoT device, voice assistants make up only 3.9% of all
devices, down from 7.3% across all homes. Game consoles
are also more popular in homes with only one IoT device, up
from 13.9% to 16.5%.
3.2 Central and South America
South American homes are the least similar to North America
of any region (Table 5). While the most common types of
IoT devices in both regions are media devices (51.7% vs
44.9%) and work appliances (24% vs 28%), signiﬁcantly
fewer South American homes have an IoT device (34% vs
71%) and there are signiﬁcantly more surveillance devices:
13.3% vs 3.7% of devices (Table 4). Prior research uncovered
that there is an increased reliance on surveillance devices
in Brazil and surrounding regions to deter violence [27, 34],
3Sony PlayStation devices are split across three vendors in this distribu-
tion primarily due to their network cards being manufactured by two third
party vendors, Azurewave (11.6%) and Foxconn (9%).

manually correct this in our analysis since Nest does not sell mobile devices.
which may offer one explanation. The only other device type
we commonly see are game consoles (9.8% of devices). No
other class appears in more than a fraction of a percent of
homes.
The vendor distribution of media devices in Central and
South America differs from the global distribution. Two ven-
dors appear in the top 5 for this region that do not appear in
any other region. First is Arcadyan, a Taiwanese company
that primarily manufactures cable boxes in this category, and
is often found in LG Smart TVs. The second is Intelbras, a
Brazilian company that manufactures DVRs and smart video
players. Intelbras accounts for 11% of the surveillance cam-
eras in the region, though they are third to Hikvision and
Dahua.
3.3 Europe
Eastern and Western Europe are both most similar to Oceania,
