When I open Atom, after updating to v0.192.0, it launches 7 processes, one of
which runs this:
    /usr/share/atom/atom --eval require('/usr/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/coffee-cash.js').setCacheDirectory('/home/yajo/.atom/compile-cache/coffee');
    require('/usr/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffee-cash/lib/coffee-cash.js').register();
    require('/usr/share/atom/resources/app/node_modules/coffeestack/index.js').setCacheDirectory('/home/yajo/.atom/compile-cache/coffee/source-maps');
    require('/usr/share/atom/resources/app/src/task-bootstrap.js');
This process hangs my system eating all CPU and RAM available.
If I kill that process before it eats my computer, I can continue using Atom,
but obviously it's not very comfortable.
I use Fedora 21 with the official RPM package from atom.io.
