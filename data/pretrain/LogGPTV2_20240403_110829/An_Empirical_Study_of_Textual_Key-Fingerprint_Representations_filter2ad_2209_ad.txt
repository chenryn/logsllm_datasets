# Experiment Results and Analysis

## Table 3: Performance Comparison of Representation Schemes
The table below presents the experimental results, showing the differences between various representation schemes. The top rows in each group represent the raw performance of a baseline scheme, followed by italicized rows that show the direct comparison delta. Values that are not statistically significant are grayed out. The columns for "fail-rate" (undetected attacks) and "false-pos" (same string rated as an attack) display percentage values.

| Scheme | Total Attacks | Tests | Fail-Rate | False-Pos |
|--------|---------------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Baseline | 479 | 4765 | -11% | -452% |
| Delta 1 | 32 | 269 | -4527% | -8% |
| Delta 2 | 340 | 35 | -4518% | -444% |
| Delta 3 | 447 | 4496 | -4796% | -4436% |
| Delta 4 | 71 | 3 | -4867% | -4427% |
| Delta 5 | 931 | 9292 | 4527% | 449% |
| Delta 6 | 4796 | 484 | 4867% | 43% |
| Delta 7 | 487 | 4436 | 444% | 9% |
| Delta 8 | 4425 | 444 | -35% | -340% |
| Delta 9 | 4856 | 487 | -4867% | -431% |
| Delta 10 | 9283 | 936 | 4518% | 457% |
| Delta 11 | 4787 | 489 | 5% | -9% |
| Delta 12 | 4858 | 492 | 4427% | 449% |

### Statistical Methods
- **Attack Detection Rate**: Evaluated using a pairwise Holm-Bonferroni-corrected Barnardâ€™s exact test (Exakt package in R), which provides high statistical power for 2x2 contingency tables.
- **Survey Ratings**: Tested using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) significance test (two-tailed). This test is suitable for 5-point Likert scales, especially when the distribution is not multimodal.

## Results

### Online Experiment
- **Participants**: 1047 participants in August and September 2015.
- **Chunk Size Test**: 400 participants in February 2016.
- **Data Exclusion**: Participants who did not complete all comparisons or failed attention tests were excluded.
- **Comparison Time**: All participants compared 46 security codes in a randomized order, with 40 (10 of each scheme) considered for evaluation. Training samples and control questions were excluded. Comparisons done in less than 2 seconds or more than one minute were also excluded.
- **Key Findings**:
  - Average time spent on comparisons varied by 4.3 seconds among schemes.
  - Peerio word-list scheme performed best with 8.7s mean, while PGP word list performed worst with 13s mean (p < 0.001).
  - Alternative key-fingerprint representations outperformed the hexadecimal scheme in attack detection rate.
  - Numeric approach had a 93.57% attack detection rate (p < 0.01) and an average speed of 10.6s (p < 0.001).
  - Generated sentences achieved the highest attack detection rate of 97.97%, but had a slightly higher false-positive rate due to line breaks in portrait orientation.

### Chunk-Size Experiment
- **Results Summary**: No statistically significant results for attack detection fail-rate. Chunk sizes with 3 and 4 characters performed best in speed, with only a 3.3-second difference.
- **Higher Attack Detection**: Higher detection rates likely due to a learning effect and a higher drop-out rate, leading to more motivated participants.

### Online Survey
- **Statements**:
  - S1: The comparisons were easy for me with this method.
  - S2: I am confident that I can make comparisons using this method without making mistakes.
  - S3: I think making comparisons using this method would help me keep my communications secure.
  - S4: I was able to do the comparisons very quickly with this method.
  - S5: I found this method difficult to use.
  - S6: Overall, I liked this method.
- **Usability and Trustworthiness**:
  - Language-based schemes (word lists and generated sentences) were rated as easier to use.
  - Sentence generators received the highest user confidence ratings.
  - More complex schemes like hexadecimal and Base32 were perceived as more secure, despite equal security levels.

### Demographics
- **Participants**: 1047 total, 1001 evaluated.
- **Gender**: 534 male, 453 female, 4 other, and some undisclosed.
- **Age**: Median age 34, average 34.4 years.
- **Medical Conditions**: 39 participants reported conditions complicating comparisons, with a slightly higher undetected attack rate (statistically insignificant).
