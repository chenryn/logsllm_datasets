User: I prefer using Notepad++ for developing,
How do I execute the files in Python through Notepad++?
Assistant: I wish people here would post steps instead of just overall concepts. I eventually got the cmd /k version to work.
The step-by-step instructions are:

In NPP, click on the menu item: Run
In the submenu, click on: Run
In the Run... dialog box, in the field The Program to Run, delete any existing text and type in: cmd /K "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
The /K is optional, it keeps open the window created when the script runs, if you want that.
Hit the Save... button.
The Shortcut dialogue box opens; fill it out if you want a keyboard shortcut (there's a note saying "This will disable the accelerator" whatever that is, so maybe you don't want to use the keyboard shortcut, though it probably doesn't hurt to assign one when you don't need an accelerator).
Somewhere I think you have to tell NPP where the Python.exe file is (e.g., for me: C:\Python33\python.exe). I don't know where or how you do this, but in trying various things here, I was able to do that--I don't recall which attempt did the trick.
