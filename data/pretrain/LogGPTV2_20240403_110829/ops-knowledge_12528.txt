User: Please explain the common network attack methods and prevention methods?
Assistant: Common network attack methods include the following: 1. Trojan horse virus: make a Trojan horse virus and transmit it to the target computer to control the computer and steal sensitive data. Prevention methods: install antivirus software, update the operating system, and do not open emails or files that come from various attachments from unknown or suspected sources. 2. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack: Send a large number of requests to the target server in a short period of time, causing the server to go down. Prevention methods: configure firewalls, upgrade server hardware, and use professional DDoS protection services. 3. Phishing attack: Impersonators send emails or phishing websites to trick users into disclosing personal information. How to prevent: Check websites, don't share sensitive information with unknown sources, use anti-phishing software. 4. Stealing account passwords: Access and steal data by stealing account passwords. How to prevent: Use high-strength password change cycles, use multi-factor authentication, and avoid logging into personal accounts in public places if possible. 5. Denial of service attack: Occupy the network bandwidth of the target computer, restrict or prevent legal access to electronic equipment and network resources. Prevention methods: configure firewalls and gateways, install intrusion detection software and limited flow/blocking software. Different network attack methods require different defense methods. As with all cyberattacks, it is important to remain vigilant and take precautions wherever possible to keep personal and organizational networks safe.
