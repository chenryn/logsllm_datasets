### Additional Information
I disagree with the following statement:  
"I agree to follow the Code of Conduct that this project adheres to. *"  
IMHO, forcing bug reporters to click this is discriminatory and unrealistic to
abide to by non-lawyers.
I disagree with the following statement:  
"I have searched the issue tracker for a feature request that matches the one
I want to file, without success. *"  
IMHO, forcing bug reporters to click this is counterproductive, issues can
provide valuable information even if searches have not been performed or
duplicate exists.
