### Expected behavior
I am writing application in react. I want to create eventListener, which will
send by ipcRenderer url of first webview, to another. Also some links should
be blocked. I tried a lot of evens, but finally ended with `'will-navigate'`
and `event.preventDefault()`.
### Actual behavior
Will-navigate doesn't work at all. It doesn't display even console logs. I
checked other events. F.g `did-navigate` or `did-navigate-in-page` and from
these events I received respones.
### How to reproduce
    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).addEventListener('did-navigate-in-page',(event) =>{ console.log("did-navigate-in-page")});
    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).addEventListener('did-navigate',(event, url) =>{ console.log("did-navigate")});
    ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this).addEventListener('will-navigate',(event, url) =>{ console.log("will-navigate")})
And responses are:
    did-navigate-in-page 
    did-navigate
