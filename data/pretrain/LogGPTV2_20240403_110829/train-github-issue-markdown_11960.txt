This simple code example ends in an Segmentation fault error.
    Mat test(720, 1280, CV_8UC3);
    string text = "";
    putText(out, text, Point(10, 10), FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.0, Scalar(0, 0, 0), 2);
The reason is the empty string (""), using any other string, that is not
empty, works fine.  
This did not happen in OpenCV 2.4.8.  
Is this meant to work this way now, that one has to check the string if it is
empty before drawing it?
