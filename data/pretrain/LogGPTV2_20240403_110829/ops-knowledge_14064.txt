User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Roundcube, upload fail I have Roundcube installed on Ubuntu 14.04, using NGINX, with static IP, SpamAssassin, ClamAV . Sending/receiving email was fine including downloads, however cannot upload anything to send.

Configuration

php.ini file

memory_limit = 256M
max_execution_time = 60
;open_basedir =
log_errors = On
post_max_size = 100M
file_uploads = On
upload_tmp_dir = /tmp
upload_max_filesize = 100M


Folder Permissions

/tmp
srw-rw---- 1 nginx nginx

/roundcube/temp
drwxrwxrwx  2 nginx nginx   4096 Feb 20 00:41 temp


In nginx.conf, under http directive, I have set

client_max_body_size 100m;


Error log

-note: output below I removed domain, and directory names.


  FastCGI sent in stderr: "PHP message: PHP Warning:  File upload error - unable to create a temporary file in Unknown on line 0" while reading response header from upstream, client: X.X.X.X server: domain.com, request: "POST /mail/?_task=mail&amp;_id=~~~from=compose&amp;_action=upload HTTP/1.1", upstream: "fastcgi://unix:/tmp/php5-fpm.sock:", host: "domain.com", referrer: "https://domain.com/mail/?_task=mail&amp;_action=compose&amp;_id:~~~~


Troubleshooting

I've set the mail/temp folder to 777 just to see if it would write a file there, and it did, but Roundcube still gave the error "File Upload Failed". Normally, that directory /mail/temp is set to 755 and would write 0kb files as opposed to 777 a file actually would be written but error in roundcube remains same either way.

I also played around with the root (PHP pointed) /tmp directory permissions to see is 777 would help (all files mentioned are accessible by nginx:nginx)  ...no joy, same error output by Roundcube: "File Upload Failed". As a last resort I pointed PHP to the same /mail/temp to see if it would write, it did but still -same roundcube error "File Upload Failed".

How can I solved this upload problem?

Assistant: Just had the same issue. Eventually tracked it down to a blank upload_tmp_dir value in my php config so try adding something like this to your apache config, or edit your php.ini:
php_admin_value upload_tmp_dir /var/tmp

Also added filesystem_attachments to my $config['plugins'] array
