The Big Challenge

Countries censor the Internet and 
people cannot access “indecent” 
websites.
Problem: “Indecent” may include VOA, AP, 
CNN, and BBC, etc.
Challenge: How to bypass censorships?

Censorship Technologies
• IP Filtering
• Domain Name Blocking
• Packet (Content/URL/Keyword) Filtering
• DNS Hijacking
• Any combination and/or variation of the 
above.
F.O.E.
Anti-Censorship Technologies
• Web-Based Proxy Servers
• Client-Side Proxy Software
• Pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
• Email
F.O.E.
Anti-Censorship Technologies
• Web-Based Proxy Servers
– Advantages: 
• Easy to deploy
• No download required
• Effective against most common forms of censorship
– Disadvantages:
• Limited multimedia capability (e.g. no videos)
• Limited interactivity (e.g. no AJAX)
• Difficult to find new proxy servers
– Example:
• Psiphon, CGIProxy (By James Marshall)
F.O.E.
Anti-Censorship Technologies
• Client-Side Proxy Software
– Advantages: 
• Automatically update  new routes.
• Browser independent.
• Better multimedia and interactivity supports.
– Disadvantages:
• Difficult to get a copy of the programs in censored countries.
• Anti-virus software may treat some programs as Trojans or viruses.
• Some systems are proprietary and may have privacy and security 
concerns.
• Connection speed can be slow for some.
– Examples:
• Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, etc.
F.O.E.
Anti-Censorship Technologies
• Pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
– Advantages: 
• Distributed, thus difficult to block.
• Data redundancy – data may be available from multiple nodes.
– Disadvantages:
• Initial nodes discovery can be difficult.
• Speed can be very slow. Usually not good enough for web browsing.
• Network reliability and security.
– Example:
• Freenet.
F.O.E.
Anti-Censorship Technologies
• Email
– Advantages: 
• Difficult to block individual emails.
• No known censorship technology blocks email delivery on the national 
firewall level.
• Can be used to update proxy addresses.
• Emails can be scrambled or encrypted to deliver sensitive information and 
bypass content filtering.
– Disadvantages:
• Susceptible to server-side spam-filtering.
• Plain-text emails are susceptible to content-filtering.
• Encrypted emails require the recipients to have certain technical skills.
• Recipients do not know whether their emails have been blocked.

FOE
A New Anti-Censorship Tool
For Receiving News/Files
F.O.E. = “Feed Over Email”
F.O.E.
Problems
No proxy, no RSS / podcast
(China’s Great Firewall blocks VOA/RFA feeds)
F.O.E.
Problems
Web (CGI) Proxy
Unreliable
IP addresses change too often
Cannot “push” content to users
No good way to inform user of new IP
F.O.E.
Problems
Proxy Clients
(e.g. Freegate)
Expensive to maintain
Proprietary
No mobile phone support
What is FOE?
• Special formatted emails for RSS feeds or 
transmitting other types of data.

Why FOE?
• Reliable public proxy servers are hard to find.
• Download sites for client-side proxy programs 
may be blocked.
• Some client-side proxy programs are slow; 
others may impose their own censorship or 
charge users for money.
• Need a mechanism to communicate with 
people in censored countries.

How F.O.E. Works?
1. User request : send feeds please
2. Server response : here you go …
RSS, podcast, software, new proxy IP, etc.

How F.O.E. Works?
• FOE messages are embedded in email messages.
• FOE messages are compressed so it can:
– Reduce the message size.
– Bypass content filters.
• Requirement: user needs a foreign email account (e.g. Gmail).
• FOE client sends a request to FOE server via email.
• FOE server sends the requested feed/file to the user’s email.
• FOE client download the FOE message and display the feed 
(or save the file).
F.O.E.
How F.O.E. Works?
Build On Email
Use existing email service providers
(e.g. Gmail)
F.O.E.
Advantages
User friendlier
(No need to update IP periodically) 
More portable
(Can be port to mobile phones easily)
Capable of “push”
(Communication is 2-way)
More reliable
(US email services are quite reliable)
Low costs
(Build on open standards-SMTP,POP3,IMAP,XML)
F.O.E.
Feed Over Email, Why?
Abundant Foreign Email Servers
No Need to Update Proxy Addresses
Secured SMTP, POP3, IMAP
Reliable
Inexpensive or Free (e.g. Gmail)
Difficult to Block
F.O.E.
Sample Usages
News feed (RSS)
Podcasting
File download
Distribute proxy IP
Get user feedback
Important announcement (push)
F.O.E.
Can It Be Blocked?
Yes, when …
Email server is blocked.
Email account is closed.
Email provider turns evil.
F.O.E.
What FOE Is and Isn’t?
FOE is:
• A tool to allow users to receive news feeds, Podcasts, 
files, programs, and proxy updates.
• A complement to existing anti-censorship solutions.
FOE is not:
• An universal proxy solution.
• For real-time applications.
• For downloading large files.
F.O.E.
Supported Platforms
PCs
Currently Supporting Microsoft Windows.
Potentially on Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc.
Mobile phones
Can easily be ported to most mobile platforms.
F.O.E.
How To Improve FOE?
• Run on other protocols (e.g. Jabber) instead of 
SMTP?
• Create a client-side plug-in architecture?
• Create an architecture to allow anyone to set up a 
FOE server to provide different services?
• Port FOE to other operating systems?
• Create FOE clients for mobile devices?

Conclusion
• FOE is one of the many tools that helps to fight Internet 
censorship.
• You can help to fight censorship by:
– Contributing to the FOE project by writing codes, submitting 
new ideas, writing papers, talking about it on your blogs and/or 
websites, and in any ways that you can imagine.  (We DO NOT 
accept money contribution but thank you for asking.)
– Creating your own anti-censorship tools and make it freely 
available to the public.
– Set up your proxy servers or other anti-censorship services to 
help people in censored countries.
– Making sure politicians hear your concerns loud and clear.
– Providing financial supports to other anti-censorship programs 
that you believe are most promising.
