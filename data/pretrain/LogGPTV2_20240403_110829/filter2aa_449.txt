# Feed Over Email (FOE)
## Project Overview
**Project URL:** [http://code.google.com/p/foe-project/](http://code.google.com/p/foe-project/)

**Description:**
Feed Over Email (FOE) is a proxy-less RSS reader designed to help users in internet-censored countries access news and information. This project aims to provide a reliable and user-friendly solution for circumventing government censorship.

## The Big Challenge
### Internet Censorship
**Facts:**
- Many countries censor the internet, blocking access to "indecent" websites.
- These "indecent" sites often include reputable news sources such as VOA, AP, CNN, and BBC.

**Problem:**
- How can users in these censored countries access blocked content?

### Offending Countries
- **Major Censors:**
  - Belarus, Burma, China, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Zimbabwe
- **Minor Censors:**
  - Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Ghana, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Maldives, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, Yemen, USA (Note: The inclusion of some countries may be surprising and requires further verification.)

### Censorship Technologies
- IP Filtering
- Domain Name Blocking
- Packet (Content/URL/Keyword) Filtering
- DNS Hijacking
- Combinations and variations of the above

### Anti-Censorship Technologies
#### Web-Based Proxy Servers
- **Advantages:**
  - Easy to deploy
  - No download required
  - Effective against most common forms of censorship
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Limited multimedia capability (e.g., no videos)
  - Limited interactivity (e.g., no AJAX)
  - Difficult to find new proxy servers
- **Example:**
  - Psiphon, CGIProxy (by James Marshall)

#### Client-Side Proxy Software
- **Advantages:**
  - Automatic updates for new routes
  - Browser independent
  - Better support for multimedia and interactivity
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Difficult to obtain in censored countries
  - May be flagged as Trojans or viruses by anti-virus software
  - Privacy and security concerns with proprietary systems
  - Connection speed can be slow
- **Examples:**
  - Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf

#### Pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
- **Advantages:**
  - Distributed, making it difficult to block
  - Data redundancy across multiple nodes
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Initial node discovery can be challenging
  - Slow connection speeds, not suitable for web browsing
  - Network reliability and security issues
- **Example:**
  - Freenet

#### Email
- **Advantages:**
  - Individual emails are hard to block
  - No known censorship technology blocks email delivery on a national firewall level
  - Can be used to update proxy addresses
  - Emails can be scrambled or encrypted to deliver sensitive information
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Susceptible to server-side spam filtering
  - Plain-text emails are susceptible to content filtering
  - Encrypted emails require technical skills from recipients
  - Recipients may not know if their emails have been blocked

## FOE: A New Anti-Censorship Tool
### Description
FOE (Feed Over Email) is a tool that uses email to deliver RSS feeds, podcasts, files, and other data to users in censored countries.

### Problems Addressed
- **No Proxy, No RSS/Podcast:**
  - China's Great Firewall blocks VOA/RFA feeds.
- **Web (CGI) Proxy:**
  - Unreliable due to frequent IP changes.
  - Cannot push content to users.
  - No effective way to inform users of new IPs.
- **Proxy Clients:**
  - Expensive to maintain.
  - Proprietary.
  - Lack mobile phone support.

### Why FOE?
- Reliable public proxy servers are hard to find.
- Download sites for client-side proxy programs may be blocked.
- Some client-side proxy programs are slow or impose their own censorship.
- Need a mechanism to communicate with people in censored countries.

### How FOE Works
1. **User Request:** Send feeds please.
2. **Server Response:** Delivers requested content (RSS, podcast, software, new proxy IP, etc.).
3. **Data Compression and Encoding:** FOE messages are compressed and Base64 encoded to reduce size and bypass content filters.
4. **Requirement:** User needs a foreign email account (e.g., Gmail).
5. **Communication Flow:**
   - FOE client sends a request to the FOE server via email.
   - FOE server sends the requested feed/file to the user’s email.
   - FOE client downloads the FOE message and displays the feed or saves the file.

### Advantages of FOE
- **User-Friendly:**
  - No need to update IP periodically.
- **Portability:**
  - Can be easily ported to mobile phones.
- **Two-Way Communication:**
  - Capable of pushing content.
- **Reliability:**
  - US email services are quite reliable.
- **Low Cost:**
  - Built on open standards (SMTP, POP3, IMAP, XML).

### Sample Usages
- News feeds (RSS)
- Podcasting
- File downloads
- Distributing proxy IPs
- Getting user feedback
- Important announcements (push)

### Potential Blockages
- Email server is blocked.
- Email account is closed.
- Email provider turns malicious.

### What FOE Is and Isn’t
- **FOE Is:**
  - A tool to receive news feeds, podcasts, files, programs, and proxy updates.
  - A complement to existing anti-censorship solutions.
- **FOE Is Not:**
  - A universal proxy solution.
  - Suitable for real-time applications.
  - Ideal for downloading large files.

### Supported Platforms
- **PCs:**
  - Currently supports Microsoft Windows.
  - Potential support for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc.
- **Mobile Phones:**
  - Can be easily ported to most mobile platforms.

### How to Improve FOE
- **Run on Other Protocols:**
  - Consider using protocols like Jabber instead of SMTP.
- **Client-Side Plug-in Architecture:**
  - Develop a plug-in architecture for more flexibility.
- **Decentralized Server Setup:**
  - Allow anyone to set up a FOE server to provide different services.
- **Cross-Platform Support:**
  - Port FOE to other operating systems.
- **Mobile Clients:**
  - Create FOE clients for mobile devices.

### Conclusion
- **FOE is one of many tools fighting internet censorship.**
- **How You Can Help:**
  - Contribute to the FOE project by coding, submitting ideas, writing papers, and promoting it.
  - Create your own anti-censorship tools and make them freely available.
  - Set up proxy servers or other anti-censorship services.
  - Advocate for policy changes.
  - Provide financial support to other promising anti-censorship programs.
