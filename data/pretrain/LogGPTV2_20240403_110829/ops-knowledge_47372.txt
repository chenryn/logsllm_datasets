User: I fired up a new Windows google compute engine instance.  It's running Windows 2008 R2, service pack 1.
I download and try running the Python .msi installer for version 2.7.9, and it fails with this error:

There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.  A program required for this install to complete could not be run.  Contact your support personnel or package vendor.

I see this error for both the 64-bit and the 32-bit installer.
Has anyone else seen it or know of a work-around?
Assistant: Install python EXCEPT "pip"
Run the python install msi again and select "change"
Select "pip" and install the pip
It would be works...

I think it is a priority problem into the msi package...the package seems to try to install the pip before installing python.exe. So, pip can not be installed...
