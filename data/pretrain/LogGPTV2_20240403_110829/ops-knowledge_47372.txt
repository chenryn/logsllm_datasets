I recently launched a new Google Compute Engine instance running Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack 1. When I attempted to install Python 2.7.9 using the .msi installer, both the 64-bit and 32-bit versions failed with the following error:

> "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor."

Has anyone else encountered this issue, or does anyone know of a workaround?

**Workaround:**

1. **Install Python without `pip`**:
   - Run the Python .msi installer again.
   - Choose the "Change" option.
   - Deselect the `pip` component during the installation process.

2. **Reinstall `pip`**:
   - After successfully installing Python, you can manually install `pip` by downloading and running the `get-pip.py` script from the official Python website.

This issue appears to be related to the order in which components are installed within the .msi package. The installer seems to attempt to install `pip` before `python.exe`, leading to the failure. By excluding `pip` during the initial installation and then adding it later, you can avoid this problem.
