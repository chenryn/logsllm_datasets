**ATT&CK ID:** T1631  
**ATT&CK Technique Name:** Process Injection

Adversaries may use process injection to evade process-based defenses or elevate their privileges. Process injection is a technique that involves executing arbitrary code within the address space of another live process. By running code in the context of a different process, adversaries can potentially access the target process's memory, system and network resources, and even gain elevated privileges. Additionally, this method can help adversaries evade detection by security products, as the malicious execution is concealed under the guise of a legitimate process.
