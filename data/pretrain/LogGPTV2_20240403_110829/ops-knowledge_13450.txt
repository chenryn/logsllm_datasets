To achieve the desired behavior, where a Python script launches an executable (`.exe`) and continues its execution independently, while also allowing the `.exe` to call back into the Python script before it finishes, you can use the `subprocess` module in Python. This approach is more flexible and powerful compared to using `os.system`, `os.startfile`, or `os.spawn*` functions.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to accomplish this:

1. **Launch the `.exe` as a separate process**:
   Use `subprocess.Popen` to start the `.exe` in a non-blocking manner, so that the Python script can continue running.

2. **Set up a mechanism for the `.exe` to call back into the Python script**:
   One common way to do this is by using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as named pipes, sockets, or even simple file-based signaling.

3. **Handle the callback in the Python script**:
   The Python script should listen for the callback from the `.exe` and perform the necessary actions.

### Example Implementation

#### 1. Launch the `.exe` using `subprocess.Popen`

```python
import subprocess
import time

# Start the .exe in a non-blocking manner
process = subprocess.Popen(["test.exe"])

# Continue with the rest of the Python script
print("Python script continues to execute...")

# Simulate some work
time.sleep(5)

# Optionally, you can check if the .exe has finished
if process.poll() is None:
    print("The .exe is still running.")
else:
    print("The .exe has finished.")

# The Python script will continue to run until it reaches the end or is interrupted
```

#### 2. Set up a callback mechanism (e.g., using a socket)

**In the `.exe` (C/C++ example)**:
- Open a socket connection to the Python script.
- Send a message to the Python script when needed.

**In the Python script**:
- Create a server socket to listen for incoming connections.
- Handle the callback when a message is received.

```python
import socket
import threading

def handle_callback(client_socket):
    try:
        data = client_socket.recv(1024)
        print(f"Received callback: {data.decode()}")
        # Perform any necessary actions based on the callback
    finally:
        client_socket.close()

def start_server():
    server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_socket.bind(('localhost', 12345))
    server_socket.listen(1)
    print("Server listening for callbacks...")

    while True:
        client_socket, addr = server_socket.accept()
        print(f"Connection from {addr}")
        threading.Thread(target=handle_callback, args=(client_socket,)).start()

# Start the server in a separate thread
server_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_server)
server_thread.daemon = True
server_thread.start()

# Start the .exe as before
process = subprocess.Popen(["test.exe"])

# Continue with the rest of the Python script
print("Python script continues to execute...")

# Simulate some work
time.sleep(5)

# Optionally, you can check if the .exe has finished
if process.poll() is None:
    print("The .exe is still running.")
else:
    print("The .exe has finished.")

# The Python script will continue to run until it reaches the end or is interrupted
```

### Summary
- Use `subprocess.Popen` to launch the `.exe` in a non-blocking manner.
- Set up a callback mechanism (e.g., using sockets) to allow the `.exe` to communicate back to the Python script.
- Handle the callback in the Python script to perform any necessary actions.

This approach ensures that the Python script and the `.exe` can run independently and communicate with each other as needed.
