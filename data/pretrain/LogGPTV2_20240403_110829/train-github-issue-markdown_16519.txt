After token `<` auto-complete doesn't really work on .tsx files.
Two examples:
Here I would like to have `boolean` in the auto-complete list, but only
functions are showed, so It only shows `Boolean`.

Here however I want a React element:
  * intrinsic types like `div` work properly 👍
  * components defined in this module as well 👍
  * but components imported are not shown in the list 👎

Still, thanks for 1.8, is much better!
