User: The disk space of a Linux server is almost full, how to troubleshoot and free up space?
Assistant: 1. Check disk space usage: You can use the df command to check disk space usage, for example: df -h. 2. Locate large files or directories: You can use the du command to view the size of files or directories in a certain directory, and arrange the files or directories from large to small, for example: du -h --max-depth=1 /. 3. Clean up log files: You can clean up some unnecessary log files under /var/log/, such as useless syslog files. 4. Clean up the cache: You can use cache cleaning tools such as bleachbit to clean up, or you can use the command sync to close the file handles of other processes. 5. Clean up useless files: delete some unnecessary files or folders, such as some old backup files, program installation files, or useless configuration files. 6. Find and close programs or processes that occupy disk space: You can use the lsof command to view programs and files that occupy disk space, and then further find out whether these programs or processes can be closed. 7. Compress unnecessary files: For some unnecessary files that cannot be deleted, you can consider using a compression tool to compress them to reduce the disk space occupied. For example, compress some historical backup files or log files.
