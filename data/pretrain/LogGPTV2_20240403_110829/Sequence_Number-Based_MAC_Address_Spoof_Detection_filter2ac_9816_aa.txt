Abstract. The exponential growth in the deployment of IEEE 802.11-
based wireless LAN (WLAN) in enterprises and homes makes WLAN
an attractive target for attackers. Attacks that exploit vulnerabilities at
the IP layer or above can be readily addressed by intrusion detection
systems designed for wired networks. However, attacks exploiting link-
layer protocol vulnerabilities require a diﬀerent set of intrusion detection
mechanism. Most link-layer attacks in WLANs are denial of service at-
tacks and work by spooﬁng either access points (APs) or wireless sta-
tions. Spooﬁng is possible because the IEEE 802.11 standard does not
provide per-frame source authentication, but can be eﬀectively prevented
if a proper authentication is added into the standard. Unfortunately, it is
unlikely that commercial WLANs will support link-layer source authen-
tication that covers both management and control frames in the near
future. Even if it is available in next-generation WLANs equipments, it
cannot protect the large installed base of legacy WLAN devices. This pa-
per proposes an algorithm to detect spooﬁng by leveraging the sequence
number ﬁeld in the link-layer header of IEEE 802.11 frames, and demon-
strates how it can detect various spooﬁng without modifying the APs
or wireless stations. The false positive rate of the proposed algorithm is
zero, and the false negative rate is close to zero. In the worst case, the
proposed algorithm can detect a spooﬁng activity, even though it can
only detect some but not all spoofed frames.
Keywords: Wireless LAN MAC spoof detection, Sequence number,

1 Introduction
The enormous popularity of IEEE 802.11-based wireless LAN (WLAN) makes it
a highly desirable target for security breach. It is also well known that the IEEE
802.11 standard has certain vulnerabilities due to ﬂaws in its MAC protocol
design [2, 16]. As a result, WLAN monitoring and surveillance systems that
can detect potential attacks in real time play an essential role in ensuring the
robustness and security of enterprise-scale WLAN networks. Development in
commercial WLAN management products [17, 18, 19] reﬂect this thinking.

If an existing network-based intrusion detection system can detect an attack
that exploits vulnerabilities at the IP layer or above, it will detect the attack
regardless of whether the packet travels on a wired or wireless link. The only
attacks that existing network-based intrusion detection systems cannot handle
are those exploiting link-layer protocol vulnerabilities. Most of these attacks
are denial of service attacks that disrupt WLAN availability by sending forged
management frames with spoofed source address, or gain unfair channel access
privilege by manipulating inter-frame spacing or duration header ﬁeld. Because
it is relatively easy to change a WLAN interface’s MAC address, spooﬁng-based
attack is particularly dangerous, and is thus the focus of this paper. An obvious
solution to spooﬁng is to support per-frame source authentication for data frames
as well as control/management frames. However, the emerging IEEE 802.11i
standard [15] only provides authentication and privacy for data frames. To the
best of our knowledge, currently there is no plan to add authentication support
for management frames. Furthermore, even if such support is available in next-
generation WLANs equipments, it cannot protect the large installed base of
legacy WLAN devices.
This paper proposes a link-layer spoof detection scheme based on the sequence
number ﬁeld in the 802.11 MAC header. Every MAC frame from a node comes
with a unique sequence number, which the node increments every time it sends
out a frame. The sequence number originally is used to re-assemble fragments of
a MAC frame in the same way as the identiﬁcation ﬁeld in the IP header. The
IEEE 802.11 standard [1] requires that the sequence number of each frame be
assigned from a counter variable, which is incremented by one whenever a frame
is sent out and whose value is modulo 4096.
If an intrusion detection system keeps track of the latest sequence number
of each wireless node, to impersonate a node an attacker needs to spoof the
source address as well as its corresponding sequence number. If the sequence
number of a spoofed frame is equal to or smaller than the corresponding node’s
current sequence number, the spoofed frame is considered a retransmitted frame
and thus has to have the same content as the previous frame with the same
sequence number. This means that the spoofed frame cannot possibly do any
harm as it is just a duplicate. If a spoofed frame’s sequence number is larger
than the corresponding node’s current sequence number, the spooﬁng will not
be detected immediately. However, some subsequent frame will have the same
sequence number as this spoofed frame and eventually expose the spooﬁng.
Using the above observations, we design and implement a sequence number-
based MAC address spoof detection system, whose eﬀectiveness is demonstrated
in this paper. A key advantage of the proposed scheme is that it leverages an
existing ﬁeld of the IEEE 802.11 header, and thus does not require any mod-
iﬁcations to STAs, APs, or the MAC protocol. In the process, we answer the
following research questions: (i) What is the sequence number change pattern in
operational WLAN networks? (ii) Given the complex sequence number change
pattern, how can we detect spoof with very few false positive and negatives?
(iii) Empirically how eﬀective the sequence number-based approach can detect
Sequence Number-Based MAC Address Spoof Detection

spoof? Although several commercial systems [17, 18, 19] claim that they can
also detect spoof, the details and eﬀectiveness of their detection mechanisms are
largely unknown. We thus believe this paper will help shed light on how spoof
detection can be done and its empirical eﬀectiveness.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes known
MAC address spoof based attack examples. Section 3 surveys previous research
related to MAC address spoof detection. Section 4 describes the design of the
proposed sequence number based MAC spoof detection algorithm and analyze
scenarios in which false positives and false negatives can arise. Section 5 reports
the results of false positive and false negative test of the algorithm. Section 6
concludes the paper with a summary of its major contributions.
2 Known Attacks Using MAC Address Spooﬁng
2.1 Deauthentication/Disassociation DoS
An STA must authenticate and associate with an AP before it can communicate
with the AP. The IEEE 802.11 standard provides deauthentication and disasso-
ciation frame for the STA or AP to terminate the relationship. Unfortunately,
the deauthentication and disassociation frames themselves do not come with
sender authentication. Consequently an attacker can send a spoofed deauthen-
tication and/or disassociation frame on behalf of the AP to STA or vice versa,
and eventually stop the data communicate between the STA and AP. The result
is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. Several tools such as Airjack [5], Void11 [4],
KisMAC [7], etc. can launch this attack easily.
When a STA receives a spoofed deauthentication frame, it will stop commu-
nicating with the AP, scan all available APs and repeat the authentication and
association process. By repeating this attack on a STA, the attacker can eﬀec-
tively prevent the STA from transmitting or receiving data indeﬁnitely because
repeated re-authentication and reassociation disrupt transport-layer protocol op-
eration as described in the paper [2].
When the AP receives a spoofed deauthentication frame, it will remove all the
state associated with the victim STA. Our test shows that if the victim STA does
not send any data to the AP, the AP will silently drop any frames destined to the
STA. This means that the victim STA is disconnected from the AP unknowingly.
Only when the victim STA starts sending frames will the AP send a deauthenti-
cation frame to the STA, which then repeats the authentication process.
2.2 Power Saving DoS
The IEEE 802.11 standard provides a power save mode to conserve a STA’s
energy. In power save mode, a STA can enter a sleep state during which it is
unable to receive or transmit. To enter the power save mode, the STA informs
the AP by setting the power management bit within the frame control ﬁeld of
a transmitted frame. Then the AP starts to buﬀer frames destined to this STA.
Periodically the STA wakes up and examines the traﬃc indication map (TIM)
312
F. Guo and T.-c. Chiueh
in the AP’s beacons to see if the AP buﬀers any frame for the STA while it is in
sleep state. If there are indeed frames buﬀered at the AP, the STA sends a PS-
Poll frame to request the delivery of these buﬀered frames. Upon receiving the
PS-Poll frame, the AP delivers these buﬀered frames and subsequently discards
the contents of its buﬀer.
In the power save mode, an attacker can spoof a PS-Poll frame on behalf of
a STA while it is asleep. The AP then sends buﬀered frames even though the
spoofed STA cannot receive frames in sleep state. As a result, an attacker can
block the victim STA from receiving frames from the AP.
2.3 AP Spooﬁng
One example AP spooﬁng attack is Airsnarf [6], using which an attacker can
set up a rogue AP with the same MAC address and SSID (network name) as a
legitimate AP in a public hotspot. When a hotspot user enters the coverage area
of the rogue AP, it may associate with this rogue AP instead of the legitimate
one, because of stronger signals for example. From this point on, this user’s traﬃc
must go through the rogue AP. The attacker could exploit this by redirecting
the user to a faked captive portal (normally a web page) and stealing the user’s
username and password. Alternatively, the attacker can use tools such as dsniﬀ
[8] to implement active man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH and HTTPS
sessions by exploiting weak bindings in ad-hoc PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).
2.4 STA Spooﬁng
An attacker can spoof a legitimate STA, and pass an AP’s MAC address-based
access control list to gain access to a WLAN. After gaining the network access,
by using tools such as WEPWedgie [3], the attacker can scan other networks. If
such scanning raises an alarm, it is the spoofed STA that gets blamed because
all the scan traﬃc appears to be from the legitimate STA.
Another possible attack [9] is to use the AP to decrypt WLAN traﬃc en-
crypted by WEP. In this attack, an attacker impersonates a legitimate STA,
captures WEP frames the STA sends, and retransmits them to the AP. The
destination IP address of these WEP frames is a host on the Internet controlled
by the attacker. After the AP decrypts these frames, they are forwarded to the
attacker-controlled host.
3 Related Work
Similar to our sequence number based approach, Wright [10] also proposes to use
sequence numbers to detect spooﬁng. However, his approach is quite simplistic as
it is solely based on sequence number gap. If the gap exceeds a certain threshold,
a spooﬁng alert is raised. This algorithm tends to introduce more false positives
and false negatives.
Instead of a threshold-based approach, Dasgupta et al. [12] use a fuzzy decision
system to detect MAC address spooﬁng. They ﬁrst collect sequence number
Sequence Number-Based MAC Address Spoof Detection

traces in which spooﬁng attacks are active to train the fuzzy system. After
training, they validate the eﬀectiveness of their system by applying it to detect
new spooﬁng attacks. This approach aims to detect sequence number anomaly.
Using fuzzy logic presumably could better accommodate ﬂuctuations in sequence
number changes. However, it is not clear that this fuzzy logic approach can
actually accommodate sequence number changes due to lost frames, duplicated
frames, and out-of-order frames.
Rather than a sequence number-based approach, Bellardo et al. [2] use the
heuristic that if a STA sends additional frames after a deauthentication/
disassociation frame is observed, the deauthentication/disassociation frame must
be spoofed. However, this heuristic can only detect spoofed deauthentication/
disassociation frames, but not other types of spoofed frames such as power-
saving, data, etc.
Cardenas [11] suggests using RARP to check whether suspicious MAC ad-
dresses are spoofed. If multiple IP addresses are returned for a given RARP
query, the MAC address probably is spoofed. However, because one NIC may
be assigned multiple IP addresses, this heuristic is not robust. Furthermore, an
attacker does not have to use a diﬀerent IP address from the victim.
Finally, Hall [13] proposes a hardware based approach to detect transceiver-
print anomaly. A transceiver-print is extracted from the turn-on transient por-
tion of a signal. It reﬂects the unique hardware characteristics of a transceiver
and cannot be easily forged. Thus the transceiver-print can be used to uniquely
identify a given transceiver. To further increase the success rate, Bayesian ﬁlter
is proposed to correlate several subsequent observations to decrease the eﬀects of
noise and interference. Though the reported success rate is as high as 94-100%,
it is unclear how practical it is to deploy this hardware.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) [15] signiﬁcantly improves WLAN security,
and includes a cryptographic method that regulate accesses to a WLAN and
indirectly deters spooﬁng. In WPA, Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
is used, which features per-packet key, authentication and replay detection. All
data frames are thus protected from spooﬁng. Unfortunately, WPA does not
protect management frames. Given this limitation and the wide deployment of
WEP-based WLAN system, the proposed spoof detection algorithm provides a
useful complement to WPA.
4 Design
4.1 Frame Sequence Number Extraction
Basically there are two ways to leverage the sequence number from the MAC
header for spoof detection. The ﬁrst way is to modify the WLAN interface driver
on every access point (AP) and station (STA) for sequence number extraction
and analysis. The advantage of this approach is that we can both detect and stop
spooﬁng in one place. The disadvantage is applying it to existing APs and STAs
is diﬃcult. Moreover, standard WLAN interface ﬁrmware does not deliver all the
frames to driver; for example, management frames are invisible. So this approach
314
F. Guo and T.-c. Chiueh
requires modifying the ﬁrmware on the WLAN interface, and is thus not very
practical given that WLAN card manufacturers generally keep this ﬁrmware as
trade secrets.
The other way to leverage sequence number for spoof detection is to im-
plement it in a WLAN monitoring system that is separate from the WLANs
being monitored. The WLAN interface of a WLAN monitoring system typically
operates in RF monitor mode, and thus can receive every IEEE 802.11 frame
appearing in the air. Because this approach uses a separate monitoring device,
it does not require any modiﬁcations to existing WLAN nodes. For the same
reason, it can only detect but not prevent spooﬁng.
Spoof detection itself is still useful as it provides visibility to the reason why
wireless service is disrupted or misused, similar to the role of traditional intru-
sion detection system. For example, when STAs are disconnected from network
frequently, if we detect spooﬁng from AP, we can know somebody is doing deau-
thentication/disassociation spooﬁng attack. Otherwise we may wrongly suspect
that the AP malfunctions. For another example, in STA spooﬁng attack, a wire-
less network may be misused by attacker to scan other networks or decrypt
frames. Without spooﬁng detection, the attacker traﬃc looks like from legiti-
mate STA and goes undetected. With the proposed spoof detection scheme, this
network misuse can be detected upon its occurrence.
With the precipitous price drop of WLAN hardware, using a separate WLAN
monitoring system for a production-mode WLAN network is no longer considered
as an expensive option. So it is no surprise that most commercial WLAN moni-
toring systems [17,18,19] in the market use monitoring devices to detect spooﬁng.
While the rest of this paper describes the sequence number-based spoof detection
mechanism in the context of a WLAN monitoring system, the same technique is
actually applicable to implementing on APs and STAs directly as well.
4.2 Patterns of Sequence Number Change
Although the IEEE 802.11 standard states that the diﬀerence between the se-
quence numbers of successive frames that are coming from a wireless node should
diﬀer by one modulo 4096, in practice, it is not always the case for various rea-
sons. As a result of this sequence number anomaly, the proposed spoof detection
algorithm may generate false positives or negatives. Therefore it is essential to
ﬁrst get a detailed understanding of how empirically the sequence numbers from
a node evolve over time. First, let’s deﬁne the sequence number gap G between
the i-th frame and the (i − 1)-th frame as follows:
G = 0xfff & (Si - Si−1)
G = - (4096 - G) if G >= 4093
where Si is the sequence number of frame i and Si−1 is the sequence number of
frame i − 1. The sequence number gap G is the diﬀerence between the sequence
numbers of two successively received frames. The above deﬁnition handles the
wrap-around case. For instance, if S0 is 4095 and S1 is 0, G will be 1. If frames
are received out of order, the gap G will have a value close to 4095. For instance,
