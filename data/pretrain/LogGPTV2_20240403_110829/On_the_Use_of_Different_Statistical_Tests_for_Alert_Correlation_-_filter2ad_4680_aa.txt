## Abstract
This paper analyzes the use of different types of statistical tests for correlating anomaly detection alerts. We demonstrate that the Granger Causality Test (GCT), one of the few methods that can be extended to the anomaly detection domain, is highly dependent on a parameter that is both sensitive and difficult to estimate. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of simpler statistical tests, which we show to be effective in a simplified correlation task without requiring complex configuration parameters.

## 1. Introduction
One of the most challenging tasks in intrusion detection is creating a unified view of events by fusing alerts from heterogeneous monitoring devices. This process, known as alert fusion, involves aggregating and correlating streams of alerts. Aggregation groups alerts that are close in time and have similar features, while correlation identifies logically linked alerts. Although "correlation" does not necessarily imply "statistical correlation," statistical methods are often used to reveal these relationships.

Alert fusion becomes more complex when dealing with anomaly detection systems, as these systems do not provide information about the type or classification of the observed attack. Most existing correlation algorithms rely on such information, making them inapplicable to purely anomaly-based intrusion detection systems.

In this work, we explore the use of statistical causality tests, which have been proposed for correlating IDS alerts and could also be applied to anomaly-based IDS. We focus on the Granger Causality Test (GCT) and show that its performance is highly dependent on a parameter that is both sensitive and difficult to estimate. We redefine the causality problem using a simpler statistical test and validate it experimentally.

## 2. Problem Statement and State of the Art
The goal of alert fusion is to provide a compact, high-level view of what is happening on a large and complex network. In this work, we use a slightly modified version of the terminology proposed in [17]. Alerts are collected from different IDS sources, normalized, and aggregated; alert correlation is the final step in this process. Figure 1 summarizes the terminology.

In [9], we proposed a fuzzy time-based aggregation technique that effectively reduces false positives. Here, we focus on the more challenging correlation phase. Designing effective and generic correlation algorithms is difficult, especially when the goal is to reconstruct complex attack scenarios.

A state-transition graph-based technique for alert correlation is described in [3]. This method uses finite state automata to describe complex scenarios but requires known scenario signatures, making it unsuitable for pure anomaly detectors. Similar approaches, with different formalisms, have been tried, such as specifying pre- and post-conditions of attacks [15] and using time-distance criteria [12]. These methods also rely on alert classifications.

Techniques that do not require alert names or classifications include time-series analysis and modeling. For example, [19] constructs time-series by counting alerts in sampling intervals and filters out predictable components. However, this is more of a false-positive and noise-suppression approach rather than a correlation approach.

The GCT-based correlation approach in [14] does not require prior knowledge and is one of the few viable proposals for anomaly detection alert correlation. We will analyze this approach in detail in Section 4.

## 3. Problems in Evaluating Alert Correlation Systems
Evaluation techniques for alert fusion systems are limited and challenging to develop [9]. Additionally, the lack of reliable, fully labeled datasets with complex attack scenarios impacts the evaluation of correlation systems. Ideally, we need both host and network datasets, but real-world dumps are not suitable due to their limitations.

The only available datasets of this kind are the DARPA IDEVAL datasets. The 1999 dataset [7], which we used for this work, has several shortcomings. It is outdated, and the network traces and host-based system call traces have known flaws [10, 11, 8, 21].

For our work, these flaws are not critical because the propagation of attack effects is realistically present. However, the intrusion scenarios are too simple and straightforward, and many attacks are not detectable in both network and host data.

The work in [14] uses the DEFCON 9 CTF dumps and the DARPA Cyber Panel Correlation Technology Validation (CTV) [4] datasets. The former is not labeled and lacks background traffic, making it unsuitable for proper evaluation. The latter, created in 2002, includes a complex testbed network and attack scenarios, but the dataset is not available for further experimentation.

Given these challenges, we use the IDEVAL dataset with a simplification: we correlate the stream of alerts from a single host-based IDS (HIDS) sensor with the corresponding alerts from a single network-based IDS (NIDS). We ran two anomaly-based IDS prototypes on the IDEVAL testing dataset, generating 128 NIDS alerts and 1070 HIDS alerts for the host pascal.eyrie.af.mil. The NIDS detected almost 66% of the attacks with less than 0.03% false positives, while the HIDS had a detection rate of 98% with 1.7% false positives.
