## Abstract
The deployment of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and other real-time streaming applications in wireless LANs (WLANs) has been limited, in part, due to high handoff latencies experienced by mobile users. This work aims to eliminate handoff latency by leveraging the potential of multiple radios in WLAN devices. Our proposed approach, MultiScan, is implemented entirely on the client side and does not require any changes to Access Points (APs) or knowledge of the wireless network topology. MultiScan nodes use their second (potentially idle) wireless interface to opportunistically scan and pre-associate with alternate APs, thereby enabling seamless handoffs for ongoing connections. This paper details the implementation of MultiScan, evaluates its impact on handoff latency, and assesses performance gains for MultiScan-enhanced wireless clients running Skype, a popular VoIP application.

## 1. Introduction
IEEE 802.11-based wireless LAN (WLAN) technologies have seen significant growth in recent years, driven by decreasing costs and increasing data rates. A key advantage for users is untethered access, allowing them to move freely within the coverage area while staying connected.

In 802.11 WLANs, clients connect to the Internet via Access Points (APs). The communication range of 802.11 devices is limited, often less than 60 meters indoors. Therefore, multiple APs are used to provide coverage over large areas, and a mobile client moving through such an area must switch between APs, a process known as handoff.

The 802.11 standard does not fully specify the handoff procedure, leading to handoff latencies ranging from 60 ms to 400 ms, with some cases experiencing connectivity gaps of up to a second. Such high latencies are acceptable for discrete mobility scenarios but are inadequate for continuous mobility scenarios, particularly for real-time, latency-sensitive applications like VoIP.

This paper addresses the need for seamless mobility in WLANs, focusing on the requirements of VoIP and other latency-sensitive applications. We propose MultiScan, a solution that uses two 802.11 network interfaces on the same device. Our experimental results show that MultiScan can completely eliminate handoff latencies, making it a practical and effective approach.

### Why Two Radios?
A two-radio interface solution is both practical and feasible, and it is the only mechanism that can eliminate handoff latencies in WLANs. While it may seem impractical to have two physically separate radio interfaces in a single device, especially in small form factors, multi-band chipsets are becoming increasingly available, making this approach timely and practical.

### Prior Approaches
Previous research, such as Neighbor Graphs and SyncScan, has focused on minimizing handoff latency for single-radio WLAN clients. These approaches require additional functionality at both clients and APs, which can be complex and resource-intensive. In contrast, MultiScan requires changes only at the wireless client, making it more straightforward and compatible with any wireless card.

### Implementation
We have implemented all necessary functionality in a Linux client as a kernel module that controls the handoff process and (re)association decisions. The MultiScan module relies on the standard Linux kernel API and is transparent to applications. The module will be made publicly available.

## 2. Background
A typical WLAN consists of multiple APs operating on independent channels to reduce interference. A client moving from one AP's coverage area to another must change its association to stay connected. The handoff process involves scanning, authentication, and association stages. Scanning, the most time-consuming stage, can be either passive or active.

## 3. Handoffs in MultiScan
In the multi-radio scenario, we assume a node has a primary and a secondary interface. The primary interface is used for communication, while the secondary interface performs management tasks. 

### Naive Approach
The secondary interface can perform the scanning stage while the primary interface communicates normally. Once the secondary interface determines the next AP, the primary interface can start the handoff process, skipping the scanning stage. This reduces handoff latency significantly.

### Aggressive Approach
To eliminate handoff latency, the secondary interface can associate with the new AP while the primary interface continues to transfer data. Once the secondary interface completes the association, the roles of the two interfaces are swapped, and the primary interface dissociates from the old AP. This approach potentially eliminates handoff latency entirely.

### Address Management
MultiScan requires no changes to the APs or the wired infrastructure. Both interfaces use the same IP and MAC addresses, making the handoff appear as if a single-radio client re-associated with a different AP. When a handoff occurs, the new AP broadcasts a gratuitous ARP to update cached ARP entries in network devices.

## 4. Experimental Evaluation
Our evaluation used computers running Gentoo Linux 2005.0, equipped with two Atheros AR5212-based wireless cards operating on non-overlapping 802.11b channels. We set up two independent APs on one host, ensuring the same clock was used for all measurements. A MultiScan module installed at the client controlled handoffs and interface switching.

We tested the performance of VoIP with MultiScan using Skype v1.0.0.20. Our results demonstrate that MultiScan can completely eliminate handoff latencies, providing seamless connectivity for real-time applications.
