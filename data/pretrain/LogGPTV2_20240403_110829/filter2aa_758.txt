Introduction to Hardware 
Hacking
Scott Fullam
Why Hardware Hacking?
• Hardware Hacking does not seem to get 
near the publicity as computer hacking
• I’d like to change reputation of hacking, 
hardware in particular
Hardware Hack: A Definition
• A (sometimes) clever modification or fix made to a piece 
of equipment that improves its performance or makes 
the equipment do something for which it was not 
originally designed.
– The results of the hack need not be ‘useful’ in the strict sense of 
the word.
• The word ‘hack’ can be used as a noun or a verb.
– Noun: “That hack you made to your toaster was great!”
– Verb “Let’s hack your brothers TV set tonight to only tune in 
channel 13!”
Why is Hardware Hacking Easier 
than Software Hacking?
•
When you buy a piece of hardware, lets say a toaster for example, 
you can open it up and see what is inside and see how it works.
– Repair manuals available for many pieces of equipment
– Your GF/SO can benefit from your hardware skills!
• You can fix stuff in the house
• When was the last time your GF/SO asked you to fix their copy of MS Word?
•
When you buy a piece of commercial software, you cannot open it 
up to see how it works.
– You are stuck with the executable file only and no source code that 
shows the inner workings
– Its behavior is fixed to that which the original programmer intended.
– You cannot examine it and change how it works.
– Open Source software is the exception to this

EE Basics
• Passive and Active Parts
– Passive Parts
• Resistors
• Capacitors
• Inductors
• Transformers
– Active Parts
• Transistors
• Diodes
• Integrated Circuits
EE Basics Cont.
•
Resistors
–
Limits (or Resists) the flow of 
electrical current
–
Value of resistor measured in 
Ohms
–
Voltage (V), Current (I), and 
Resistance (R) follows the 
equation V=I x R.
–
An example of how a resistor can 
be used
•
Current limiter for LED
•
LEDs can be burned out if too 
much current is allowed to pass 
through them. If an LED is 
connected to a directly battery 
with no current limit, the LED will 
stop working. Add a resistor in 
series to limit the current to the 
LED to fix this problem.
EE Basics Cont.
•
Capacitors
–
Stores electrical energy in the 
form of an electric field
–
Act like small batteries
–
Value of capacitor measured in 
Farads. (after Michael Farady)
–
Voltage, Current, Capacitance 
follow this equation: I = C dv/dt
–
Are sometimes polarized (they 
have a ‘plus’ side and a ‘minus’
side)
–
Are often used to filter noisy 
circuits
•
Most circuits will place many 
capacitors across their power 
supplies to decrease overall noise
EE Basics Cont.
• Inductors
– Stores energy in the form 
of a magnetic field
– Values specified in Henries
– Voltage (V), Current (I), 
and Inductance (L) follow 
this equation:   V = L di/dt
– Often used to filter out 
Radio Frequency (RF) 
Interference
– Used extensively in power 
supplies
EE Basics cont.
•
Transformers
•
Couples energy from one side 
to the other via magnetic field
•
The turns ratio determines the 
ratio of AC voltage
•
Used to isolate signals
– A signal from one side is 
transferred to the other without 
a common ground
•
Used to ‘step up’ a voltage
– Can be used to generate large 
voltages
EE Basics Cont
• Active Components
– Transistors
• Act as a switch
• Two basic types
– BiPolar
– Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS)
– Diodes
• One way gate
• Light Emitting Diode
– Integrated Circuits

–
Zener
•
Each has a ‘plus’ side and a 
‘minus’ side
•

‘minus’ side
•
Current is conducted from the plus 
side to the minus side
•

above
–

•
Forward Voltage Drop of 1.7V and 
above
•
Available in many colors
•
Each has a ‘plus’ side and an 
‘minus’ side
•
The ‘minus’ side often has a flat 
spot
EE Basics cont
• How to read the numbers 
on an IC package
• Look for manufacturers 
logo
• Look at first part of 
numeric string on part
– Numbers and letters after 
the ‘dash’ are often speed 
grades and production date 
codes
• Look up numbers on the 
web
EE Basics Cont
• Here are a few 
examples of well 
known chip 
companies
Cracking the Case
• How can you open an enclosure without 
destroying it?
– Have the right tools
• Lots of Small Screwdrivers
• Philips and flat head
– Know how most enclosures are fastened together.
• Fasteners
– Screws
– Plastic snaps molded into the case
– Glue
– Double Sided Tape
Cracking the Case cont.
•
Hardware Hacking is like surgery!
–
You wouldn’t want your doctor using an axe to 
perform an appendectomy… Good Tools
–
Get high quality hardened steel tools
•
The cheap stuff breaks and strips the heads off 
the screws
–
Torx drivers
•
Star shaped head
•
Many consumer electronics cases now use 
these
–
Hex Drivers
•
Hexagon shaped head
•
Also popular in consumer electronics
–
Tweezers
•
Useful for fishing out dropped screws from 
inside cases
•
Flat end can be used as a pry bar
–
Dental Picks
–
Razor Blades
•
I prefer Xacto style with handles
–
Collecting the tools can be an obsession of its 
own
•
Be the envy of the other hardware hackers by 
having the latest German hardened steel drivers
Cracking the Case cont.
• Common case fasteners
– Screws
– Plastic snaps molded into case
– Glue
– Double Sided Tape
• The Palm V case is held together this way. You need a hair 
dryer to heat up the tape so that it releases to open it
• Screws are often placed so that they cannot be 
seen
– On the bottom of the product
– Under labels
– Under the ‘feet’ of the product
Cracking the Case cont.
•
Good ways to open up the case
– Clear a table top
– Place sheets of white paper under the items to 
be opened
• You can see dropped screws better on the white 
paper
– Make sure power has been removed from the 
device being taken down
• Unplug it
• Remove all batteries
– Carefully remove all of the screws you can find
• Make sure to look under all labels and feet
• Take another piece of paper and sketch a rough 
outline of the case on it.
• After each screw is removed, tape it to the 
diagram in its approximate location.
– This makes it a lot easier to put them all back when 
you are done
Cracking the Case cont.
– Look for seams and gently pull at them
• Don’t force it.
• Use tweezers or a pick to open up a crack along the seam
• Pull the two halves and feel for any resistance
– Anywhere there is resistance, look for a screw that was not removed
– Look for a plastic snap and pry it apart with the back of the tweezers
– Once the electronics are exposed, be careful not damage them 
with static electricity
• Use a commercial static wrist strap that is plugged into a Ground 
point
• If no commercial static wrist strap is available frequently touch the 
screw that holds the power outlet to the wall
– Better yet, attach a wire to this screw and attach the other end of the 
wire to your wrist by stripping 8” of the insulation and wrapping the 
exposed wire around your wrist
– Do _not_ plug the wire into any of the outlet holes.

idea with less work
– Made design trade offs

basic concept in a 
weekend

halogen lamp is placed in front 
of each window
– Over 5,000 meters of Cat5 
cable is used
•
The system is controlled by a 
Linux PC with a 192 channel 
parallel I/O card

A Renaissance in Hacking!
• Hardware Hacking is Easy and Fun!
• It is akin to recycling
– Old equipment gets reused
• You can learn something while doing it
– The process of deconstruction is educational
• Be careful when hacking anything that is 
plugged into the wall or has powerful motors in it
– Unplug/deactivate the equipment first
• Go Home today and Hack something!
