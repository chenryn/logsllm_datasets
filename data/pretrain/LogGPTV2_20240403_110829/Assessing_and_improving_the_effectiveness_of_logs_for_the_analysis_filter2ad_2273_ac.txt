### Halt Failures and Their Logging in DDS Systems

Halt failures are predominantly unlogged, accounting for 75.3% of the total. Most of these failures originate from the `DataWriterImpl` and `PublisherImpl` DDS modules (16.4%), often due to issues with the file system or message manipulation. Unlogged silent failures, which constitute 42.8%, primarily occur within the lower DDS transport layer (18%) and the `Service_Participant` module (13%). These failures are typically caused by send buffer manipulations and bad QoS setups.

### Analysis of Silent and Content Failures

Silent failures are mostly unlogged (80.7%). Corrupted messages delivered to the subscriber side without any notification lead to effective logging on the subscriber side, acting as an external detector. Halt failures in the `Service_Participant` module (12%) remain a significant source of unlogged failures. A significant percentage (39.2%) of silent failures are related to bad manipulations of DDS messages, particularly in the `DataReaderImpl` module (13.5%) and the DDS lower transport layer (11%).

Content failures, which are mostly unlogged (93.5%), are due to problems in the DDS transport layer. During the topic-subscription phase, errors during message delivery in the `DataReaderImpl` (60.8%) are mainly unlogged. 

### MySQL DBMS

MySQL is a widely used open-source DBMS with a market share of about 30%. The experimental setup includes a MySQL server and a client running on the same machine. The client is a SQL testing tool, MySQL Test Run (MTR), which is part of the MySQL source code. We selected 73 test cases to cover most MySQL features, executed sequentially during each experiment.

### Apache Web Server: Improvement in Logging

Almost all halt failures (97.9%) are detected by the `mysqld_safe` process, which receives notifications from the OS. However, the coverage for halts is lower (46.2%). To improve logging, we propose adding additional log events in the most likely failure locations. This can be achieved by analyzing memory dumps and ranking functions by the number of occurrences. For example, in the `apr_palloc` function, logging can be added to detect and handle NULL pointer usage.

### Conclusion

Current logging mechanisms in DDS, MySQL, and Apache need improvement to provide comprehensive insights into fault propagation. By identifying and logging critical failure points, we can enhance the reliability and maintainability of these systems.
