NO ONE SAID IT WAS SECURE
EVERYBODY’S JOB IS NOBODY’S JOB
“This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody.  
There was an important job to be done and Everybody was asked to do it.  Everybody was 
sure Somebody would do it.  Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it.  Somebody 
got angry about that, because it was Everybody's job.  Everybody thought Anybody could 
do it but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it.   
!
It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could 
have done.”
