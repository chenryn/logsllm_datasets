### The Parable of Responsibility
"This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody. There was an important job to be done, and Everybody was asked to do it. Everybody was sure Somebody would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry about that because it was Everybody's job. Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn't do it. It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done."

### The State of Open Source
"Open source projects play a crucial role in the digital age but are maintained by a small, strained cadre of volunteers. There are many critical libraries maintained by volunteers that do not receive enough attention."

### Key Issues in Open Source Security
- **C/C++**: "Memory lifecycle and boundary management is a significant challenge in application logic."
- **Java**: "It’s not like Java suddenly became insecure; it has been insecure for years."
- **PHP**: "PHP 0-day vulnerabilities for everyone, with no defined security strategy or reporting contact. Inconsistent coding styles, usage, or complex code can lead to low maturity and trending upward issues."

### Change is Hard
"System administrators often resist change when they have to bear the brunt of its adverse effects."

### Building Blocks of the Internet
- **Demos**: (And you can do it too!)

### What Do We Do Now?
- **Incentives**: Full disclosure, street cred, and even 'lulz' can be motivators.
- **Obstacles**: Tooling, tuning, and correlation.
- **Automation**: Explore tools like *hacktheplanet.ninja*.

### One More Thing...
- **VIM**: "VIM 0-day for everyone."
