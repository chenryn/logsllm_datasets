Downloaded bootstrap and had to recompile it to use the grid system we are
using for the site. Only changed variables.less. Once I recompiled,
placeholder text on all inputs no longer works. Did some testing and found it
was due to the "-webkit-transform-style: preserve-3d;" property on inputs and
selects. Looked in the forms.less and the pre-compiled bootstrap.css files and
didn't see the rule.
Honestly, I'm not sure if this is a problem with the compilers I'm using
(Less.app and SimpLESS.app on Mac OS X) but considering they should be using
the same compiler, not sure why this property is appearing in my compiled
versions but not the pre-compiled version
(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/1.4.0/bootstrap.min.css). Any ideas?
Removing that line fixes placeholder text but I'd rather not have to touch the
file beyond editing variables.less.
