Before we start…a slight detour 
Introduction on the Teensy 
•  Originally covered by Adrian Crenshaw (irongeek) 
•  Morphed into a weapon last year at Defcon. 
•  The ability to emulate any keyboard and leverage full character 
sets with on-board storage. 
The Teensy Device 
Teensy, Teensy ++, Customized 
Motion Sensor Teensy (thnx. Garland) 
Let’s walk through some basics 
•  In order to get a binary to the system we need to convert it to 
keyboard-acceptable characters. 
•  Our choice was leveraging binary to hex conversion methods. 
Conversely you could easily use base64. 
Some code 
Okay now we got some hex… 
•  Okay, now we have some hex… We need a way to convert it 
back to a binary when its written to a file on the system through 
the teensy.. 
•  You could leverage vbs, we decided on PowerShell as it’s 
pretty much on every Windows XP instance and integrated into 
Vista and Windows 7 and can’t be removed. 
Some more code 
Moving it to Teensy 
Moving it to Teensy Pt. 2 
Bummer… 
•  So unfortunately, this method didn’t work, after breaking it 
down to hex or base64, the file was above what the Teensy++ 
could handle. 
•  So we looked at another alternative… 
Shellcodeexec 
•  Works on DEP/NX enabled systems by storing shellcode as 
+rwx. 
•  Supports alphanumeric encoded payloads which means a 
meterpreter stager will be extremely small character wise. 
Testing it out… 
•  Custom compile shellcodeexec and convert to hex 
•  Create a meterpreter reverse_tcp via alphanumeric shellcode 
•  Execute shellcode exec and launch alphanumeric shellcode 
into memory without ever touching disk 
DEMO 
That’s not all… 
•  We then soldered on the SDCard mount and were able to get 
the teensy to read off the microcontroller and put as large of a 
file as we want onto the system.. 
Okay…back on track sorry. Squirrel… 
Introduction 
•  We’ll be covering three main categories.  
• 
IEEE 1901-2010 Standard for Broadband over Power Lines (published February 2011) 
• 
IEEE 1675-2008 Standard for Broadband hardware installation 
• 
G.hn is a competing standard (for example AT&T uses this) 
• 
X10, Crestron, Lutron, Z-Wave 
• 
New tools release 
• 
How to leverage these in penetration testing 
• 
New things to come that are currently in development 
Broadband over Power Lines (BPL) 
• 
Speeds around 500KB to 135MBPS based on price (home plug 
certification).  
• 
Leveraged for Ethernet over power lines. 
• 
Mostly used as residential areas for home networking however used 
in some corporate environments.  
• 
Homeplug 2005 AV specification increased the peak data from 14 
MBPS to 200 MBPS.  
• 
Homeplug PHY is used for smart grid infrastructures (100 bucks for 
the specification…just Google for it :P) but is mostly being used for 
smart grids as well as home use. 
Understanding BPL 
• 
Normal wiring systems were designed for the transmissions of 
AC power.  
• 
Drawbacks are it has a limited to carry higher frequencies 
• 
Most home/corporate security uses 56bit DES :P 
• 
Typically transmits via medium to high frequencies (1.6 to 
80mhz) for more corporate use and 20 and 200khz for home 
use. 
• 
BPL is actively being used in car network communications, 
HVAC systems, security systems, network communications and 
much more. 
PHY Smart Grids 
• 
Allows long range transmissions of network 
signals through multiple power lines. 
• 
Used by virtually every country due to its low 
cost implementation. 
• 
Allows communications on both wired and 
wireless based transmissions. 
• 
The PHY Alliance and Zigbee Alliance has came 
together to create a single standard for a combined 
infrastructure. 
Home Ethernet over Power 
• 
Generally support DES (ew) or AES.  
• 
Turned off by default. 
• 
Allow as many devices you want to plug in to 
support power of Ethernet. 
• 
Awesome for penetration testing.  
Real World Scenario 
• 
Physical penetration test on CompanyX. 
• 
You place the BPL device next to a 
company within the corporate 
environment.  
• 
You can now find a place inside the 
organization or outside exposed power 
jacks to perform your penetration test. 
Home Automation 
• 
We’ll be covering the two main ones: 
• 
X10 (60 Hz over powerlines) 
• 
Z-Wave (900 MHz) 
• 
There are a number of other ones including 
proprietary/commercial:  
• 
Crestron 
• 
Lutron (433 mhz) 
• 
Zigbee (2.4ghz, 915 MHz, and 868 MHz) 
• 
Insteon (dual band powerlines and RF) 
Home Automation Basics 
• 
Home automation is used in a number of large businesses, homes and other facilities. 
• 
Provides interconnectivity to multiple systems and allows automated responses to occur 
based on if a criteria is met. 
• 
Gaining major momentum in most organizations. 
Basics of X10 
• 
Still highly used within home automation. 
• 
Provides easy access to communicate between devices through power lines and 
some through RF. 
• 
Some equipment used by X10 include: 
• 
HVAC 
• 
Motion Sensors 
• 
Lights 
• 
Cameras 
• 
Security systems 
• 
Doors 
Some drawbacks of X10 
• 
Lack of encryption (ouch) 
• 
Only allows 256 devices 
• 
Could have heavy interference

X10 Kit 
Testing the jammer/sniffer 
The Arduino Device 
New Tool Release – X10 Blackout 
• 
In the Social-Engineer Toolkit v2.0 
• 
Jams X10 based signals in order to prevent security systems from triggering or other 
devices. 
• 
Easy to do with RF however illegal  but…hypothetically…  
New Tool Release – X10 Sniffer 
• 
In the Social-Engineer Toolkit v2.0 
• 
Sniffs all X10 bases traffic and sends you the information. We’ve been playing around 
with it sending over Verizon via text messages, almost done… Right now it writes to 
external storage. 
• 
Ability to trigger on certain events, for example if a security system is armed and 
triggers, it will send a jamming signal to prevent it from alerting. 
• 
A lot of the security systems use RF which is identical to jam, just via a airwaves. 
Z-Wave 
• 
Leverages Mesh networks in order to communicate between devices 
• 
Support for AES however we haven’t found a device that uses it (we’ll talk about this). 
• 
Similar devices can be leveraged via Z-Wave and is considered one of the more 
prominent home automation standards. 
Z-Wave 
• 
Jamming is very simple and can cause significant disruptions (illegal? :P) 
• 
Transmission on the Z-Wave network is relatively easy and the SDK provides a Z-Wave 
sniffer for “troubleshooting”. 
• 
Easy to develop Z-Wave based-sniffer that jams signals based on certain criteria, i.e. 
motion sensors, cameras, etc. 
• 
Ability to inject seamless data into the Z-Wave network including replay of camera feeds, 
and such. 
AES Encryption Exposure 
• 
During initial pairing of devices, the 
AES initialization key can be 
captured allowing decryption and 
tampering of communications. 
• 
Not leveraging standard FIPS 
compliant-based transmission of 
AES key. 
New Tool Release 
• 
The Social-Engineer Toolkit v2.0 is now being released. 
• 
Includes all of the code to automatically generate all of this for you. 
Coming soon…. 
• 
Sniffer based on Z-Wave initialization encryption keys. 
• 
Sniffer and Z-Wave injector that will send information to the systems.
