## Abstract
Comment spam is a prevalent method used by spammers to attract direct visits to target websites or to manipulate their search rankings. By posting a small number of spam messages on each victim website (such as forums, wikis, guestbooks, and blogs, which we term "spam harbors"), spammers can inherit the reputations of these sites while evading content-based detection systems. To identify suitable harbors, spammers often have preferred methods based on available resources and costs, leading to the formation of a stable set of harbors that are easy and friendly for spamming, known as their "spamming infrastructure." Our measurements show that different spammers typically have distinct infrastructures, although there may be some overlap.

This paper introduces NEIGHBORWATCHER, a comment spam inference system that leverages information about spammers' infrastructures to detect comment spam. At its core, NEIGHBORWATCHER uses a graph-based algorithm to characterize the relationships between spam harbors and reports a spam link if it appears in the harbor's clique neighbors. Starting with a small seed set of known spam links, our system inferred approximately 91,636 comment spams and 16,694 spam harbors frequently used by spammers. Evaluation on real-world data demonstrates that NEIGHBORWATCHER can continuously infer new comment spam and discover new spam harbors daily.

## 1. Introduction
Spamdexing, also known as web spam or search engine spam, involves artificially improving the search rank of a target website. This practice causes unnecessary work for search engine crawlers, degrades user experience with poor search results, and often leads to phishing websites or malware downloads. Google reports about 95,000 new malicious websites daily, resulting in 12-14 million daily search-related warnings and 300,000 download alerts.

To boost the ranking of target websites, spammers have developed various techniques, including text and link manipulations. However, as search engines have improved their detection methods, spammers have shifted to comment spamming. This involves automatically posting random comments or specific messages (with links to promoting websites) on benign third-party websites that allow user-generated content, such as forums, blogs, and guestbooks. These victim websites, termed "spam harbors," provide spammers with several benefits: they can easily inherit the reputation of these sites, reduce the risk of detection, and disguise themselves as normal contributors.

Current state-of-the-art approaches to detect comment spam rely on content-based, context-based, and behavior-based features. However, these methods have limitations, and spammers have become adept at evading them. For example, content-based detection can be bypassed by mixing spam links with normal content or by spamming a large variety of harbors. Context-based features, such as URL cloaking, are less effective because many comment spams do not use these techniques. Behavior-based features, like time differences between posts, are only applicable to certain types of websites.

To address these limitations, we propose NEIGHBORWATCHER, a content-agnostic system that focuses on the structure of spammers' infrastructures rather than the content. Our approach is based on the observation that while spam content can be dynamic, the structure of spamming campaigns and infrastructures is more persistent. By recognizing patterns in the structure of spammers' infrastructures, NEIGHBORWATCHER can continue to detect spam even if the content changes frequently.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Threat Model
In comment spamming, spammers first identify suitable harbors, such as those with good reputations, weak sanitization mechanisms, or that can be automatically spammed. They use Google dorks or underground markets to find these harbors. Once identified, spammers verify the harbors by posting random normal content. After validation, they begin large-scale spamming. When search engine bots crawl these harbors, they index the spam URLs, improving the search rank of the promoted websites.

### 2.2 Categories of Spam Harbors
Spammers typically use three types of harbors: blogs, forums, and guestbooks. Blogs allow users to post articles and comments, making them susceptible to spam if the content is unrelated to the article or posted long after the article. Forums require registration but offer long-lasting conversations, making detection based on posting time difficult. Guestbooks are more flexible, allowing anyone to leave messages at any time, making them challenging to detect spam in.

## 3. Spam Harbor Measurement
To gain a deeper understanding of comment spam, we studied the properties of spam harbors. We started with 10,000 verified spam links and collected a dataset of 38,913 real-world spam harbors. We observed that spam harbors typically contain embedded hyperlink tags, as spammers use these to ensure a high success rate of posting spam links. We extracted search results with embedded hyperlink tags and further crawled all possible pages on each harbor, recording timestamps.

## 4. Design and Implementation of NEIGHBORWATCHER
NEIGHBORWATCHER uses a graph-based propagation algorithm to characterize the neighborhood relationships among collected spam harbors. When a new comment with a link is posted, the system performs a neighborhood watch and calculates a suspicious score based on the graph-based inference. Our prototype implementation on real-world data shows that NEIGHBORWATCHER can continuously find new spam and spam harbors.

## 5. Evaluation Results
Our evaluation on real-world data demonstrates that NEIGHBORWATCHER detected 91,636 spam links and 16,694 spam harbors. Among these, 1,364 spam URLs were not indexed by Google, and 147 spammer IPs and 4,008 spammer email addresses were not found in existing blacklists. This indicates that our system can detect new spam earlier than Google and existing blacklist services.

## 6. Extensions and Limitations
We discuss various extensions and limitations of NEIGHBORWATCHER, including potential improvements and areas for future research.

## 7. Related Work
We review related work on comment spam detection and compare our approach with existing methods.

## 8. Conclusion
In conclusion, NEIGHBORWATCHER is a content-agnostic comment spam inference system that leverages the structure of spammers' infrastructures to detect comment spam. Our system can continuously find new spam and spam harbors, providing an effective solution to the problem of comment spam.
