### Test 1: Image File Recovery
**Objective:** Determine if the image file was recoverable from various drives.

**Results:**
- The file was ultimately recoverable on all drives.
- Only the Intel SSD required additional file carving to recover the image file.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable
- Crucial SSD: Recoverable
- Intel SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable
- Samsung SSD: Recoverable
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable

### Test 2: Single JPG File, TRIM Disabled, Quick Format
**Procedure:**
- Performed a quick format on all drives from the previous test using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Safely removed the drives and imaged them using a forensic write blocker.
- Ran file carving on each drive image to determine if the image was still recoverable.

**Results:**
- The quick format resulted in the image becoming irrecoverable on several of the SSDs.
- The image was recoverable from two of the SSDs and the control hard drive using file carving.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
- Intel SSD: Not recoverable
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Samsung SSD: Not recoverable
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable

### Test 3: Single JPG File, TRIM Enabled, SSD Connected via USB
**Procedure:**
- Saved a single JPG file to each drive using the evidence creation machine via USB.
- The evidence machine was running Windows 7 with TRIM command enabled in the operating system.
- Unmounted the drive to ensure the file was written to disk.
- Re-mounted the drive and deleted the file.
- Immediately unmounted the drive and connected it to the write blocker on the evidence collection machine for imaging.
- Investigated the image to determine if the image file was recoverable.

**Results:**
- The file was ultimately recoverable on all drives.
- Only the SuperTalent SSD required additional file carving to recover the image file.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable
- Crucial SSD: Recoverable
- Intel SSD: Recoverable
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable
- Samsung SSD: Recoverable
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)

### Test 4: Single JPG File, TRIM Enabled, SSD Connected via USB, Quick Format
**Procedure:**
- Performed a quick format on all drives from the previous test using the evidence creation machine via USB.
- Safely removed the drives and imaged them using a forensic write blocker.
- Ran file carving on each drive image to determine if the image was still recoverable.

**Results:**
- The image was recoverable with file carving on all drives except the Crucial SSD.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
- Intel SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Samsung SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)

### Test 5: Single JPG File, Windows XP
**Procedure:**
- Saved a single JPG file to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- The evidence machine was running Windows XP, which does not support TRIM in the operating system.
- Unmounted the drive to ensure the file was written to disk.
- Re-mounted the drive and deleted the file.
- Immediately unmounted the drive and connected it to the write blocker on the evidence collection machine for imaging.
- Investigated the image to determine if the image file was recoverable.

**Results:**
- The results were identical to the previous test on Windows 7 with TRIM disabled: the file was ultimately recoverable on all drives.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable
- Crucial SSD: Recoverable
- Intel SSD: Recoverable
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable
- Samsung SSD: Recoverable
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable

### Test 6: Single JPG File, Windows XP, Quick Format
**Procedure:**
- Performed a quick format on all drives from the previous test using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- Safely removed the drives and imaged them using a forensic write blocker.
- Ran file carving on each drive image to determine if the image was still recoverable.

**Results:**
- The image was recoverable with file carving on all drives.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Crucial SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Intel SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- Samsung SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable (with file carving)

### Test 7: Two JPG Files, One Deleted
**Procedure:**
- Saved two different JPG files to each drive using the evidence creation machine via eSATA.
- The evidence machine was running Windows 7 with TRIM support enabled.
- Unmounted the drive to ensure the files were written to disk.
- Re-mounted the drive and deleted a single file, leaving the second file untouched.
- Immediately unmounted the drive and connected it to the write blocker on the evidence collection machine for imaging.
- Investigated the image to determine if the deleted image file was recoverable.

**Results:**
- The image was completely recoverable on only half of the SSDs.
- Both the Crucial and Intel SSDs performed garbage collection, rendering the deleted file unrecoverable.
- The file on the Samsung SSD was partially recoverable using file carving but was damaged, with a significant portion of the file corrupt or missing.

**Per-Drive Results:**
- Seagate HD: Recoverable
- Crucial SSD: Not recoverable
- Intel SSD: Not recoverable
- OCZ SSD: Recoverable
- Patriot SSD: Recoverable
- Samsung SSD: Partially recoverable (file is damaged)
- SuperTalent SSD: Recoverable
