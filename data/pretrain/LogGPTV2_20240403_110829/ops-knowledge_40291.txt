User: How to use the command line tool of Linux system to check whether the network port is open?
Assistant: You can use the following commands to check whether the network port is open: 1. Telnet: Use the telnet command to test whether the specified IP address and port are open. For example: telnet example.com 80 If the message "Connected to example.com" is returned, it means the port is open. 2. Netcat: Netcat is a network tool that can be used to connect to a specified IP address and port. If the connection is successful, the port is open. For example: nc -v example.com 80 If the connection is successful, the message "Connection to example.com 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!" will be displayed. 3. Nmap: Nmap is a network scanning tool that can be used to scan specified IP addresses and ports to determine whether they are open. For example: nmap -p 80 example.com If the port is open, the message "80/tcp open http" will be displayed. The above three methods can be used to check whether the network port is open, just choose one of them.
