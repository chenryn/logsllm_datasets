 Why does this matter?
Privacy advocacy
People think they’re safe
Privacy is not a guarantee.  It 
can be taken from you.
True anonymity is actually 
extremely difficult to 
achieve!!
 So we decided to attack users 
instead of websites for once.
4
 Safety from trolls who want 
to drop docs
 Safer for political dissidents
 Safer for potential victims of 
violent crimes (women, 
children)…
 Allows people to be 
themselves (for good or bad)
 Safer for whistle blowers
 Increases freedoms
5
 Haven for “evildoers”
Allows them to attack easily
Allows them to retreat easily
Allows them to exfiltrate data 
easily
 Hurts law enforcement
 Prevents “social compact” 
rules of order from working in 
online contexts.
6
 The ecosystem is too 
complex
 IP is the “gold 
standard” for tracking 
people down on the 
Internet, but what if 
we could do better?
 Let’s start with the 
basics of how people 
anonymize
themselves.
7
 Basic anonymization guide
 Proxies:
CGI proxies
SOCKS Proxies
Tor
Hacked machines
 Freemail
Hotmail
Gmail
Hushmail
8
 Good/Normal Use
 Improving the trust model
Client: has the cert in the browser
Servers: requires all clients have valid certs
 What if the client goes to another website with 
SSL?
 Browser defaults to send the public key
 Well, could this be 
malicious?
 Sniff the public key
 Information
 System/OS
 Usernames/Emails
 Data correlation 
Tie a user back to a 
system

 Open Proxies you trust?
 HackedTor.exe
Setup the Client
Tor node just logs everything

 Browsers lie about having a 
same origin policy (or at least 
are terrible at enforcing it)
 Plugins lie worse
 Websites control browsers, not 
the other way around in a 
decloaking scenario

 Mr T
Plugins
History
Screen Resolution
 BeEF
VMware detection (IE only)
Plugin detection

 But…. The Cloud is the new 
Hotness!

 VM Detection
VMware
QEMU
VirtualBox
 Amazon EC2 Detection

 Cross-Platform
 New BeEF Module!
 Leverage this knowledge in 
our attacks

 Java
Java internal IP
 Flash
 scp:// (winSCP)
 Word/pdf bugs
 Media player

Already part of 
decloak.net

 res:// timing
 res:// timing without 
JavaScript
 smbenum
- “Wtf?”
16
 SMB enum only finds certain 
types of files and only if known 
prior to testing
 SMB enum could also gather 
usernames through brute force
 Usernames + res:// timing 
could gather programs that 
smbenum alone couldn’t
17
 But seriously – that’s just 
terrible, let’s just get the 
username and computer 
name directly!
