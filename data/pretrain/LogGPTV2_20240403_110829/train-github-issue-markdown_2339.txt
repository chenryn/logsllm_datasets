Please refer to the example at [this JSFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/PnLkH/1/).

When using contextual classes (e.g., `panel-warning`) on `panel` elements, the `panel-footer` does not inherit the appropriate color styling. In contrast, the `panel-heading` is correctly styled with the contextual class.

For clarity and consistency, it would be ideal if both the `panel-footer` and `panel-heading` were styled appropriately when a contextual class is applied to the `panel`.
