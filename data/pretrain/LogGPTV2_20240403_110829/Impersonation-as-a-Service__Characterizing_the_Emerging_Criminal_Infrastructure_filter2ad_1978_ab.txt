abled by this attack strategy. However, password-reuse attacks may
provide the attacker with access to additional platforms on top of
the one that suffered the leak.
Phishing kits. attackers can employ kits to deploy phishing websites
aimed at stealing user credentials. As users directly interact with
the phishing kit, user profiling can be achieved by injecting finger-
printing code in the phishing webpage [40]. The profiles derived
through phishing kits are however limited to only one occurrence
of the authentication (on the phishing website) and may be in-
complete or inaccurate. For example, the employment of password
manager software may hinder the realism of the derived fingerprint
(e.g., in terms of input time or user behaviour on the page) when
compared to the one measured by the original platform. To achieve
multi-platform capabilities, the attacker must develop or acquire
a phishing kit for each of the phished platforms, and collect the
relevant data through separate attacks against the same user.
Malware. the attacker has access to the system through a keylogger
or trojan/bot. This requires the attacker to either purchase/rent
the infected system [20], or create the infection themselves (e.g.,
through malware attached to a phishing email, or through Pay-per-
Install services [10]). Due to the specificity of the attack, custom
malware is likely needed to collect and update the profiles. As the
attacker is virtually already in full control of the user system, they
can collect user profiles related to any platform accessed by the
victim. However, due to the position of the attacker, most of the
impact (e.g., email access or web session hijacking) can be achieved
through malware without the need of collecting the user profiles
to then replicate them at a later stage.
By only owning the credentials of the victim, the attacker cannot bypass the MFA as the Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) system will detect an anomaly in the profile of the
authenticating user. By relying on Impersonation-as-a-Service (IMPaaS), the attacker can reliably impersonate that profile by providing the values the RBA system expects for that
user. IMPaaS obtains user profiles from a (large) botnet, and provides them in bundles as user profiles. An attacker purchases a user’s profile(s) on the IMPaaS platform together
with a browser extension that, provided the victim’s profile as an input, reproduces it when accessing a service.

is available, amount of stolen cookies, date of profile acquisition,
and others. The user profiles available on the IMPaaS platform are
automatically updated by the underlying infrastructure (e.g., as
users change software configuration, or update passwords); fur-
ther, the attacker can easily enforce and switch across the acquired
user profiles by means of a dedicated browser extension provided
by the IMPaaS platform, effectively commodifying the systematic
impersonation of Internet users at large across multiple platforms.
Profile acquisition. The IMPaaS infrastructure is fueled by a bot-
net whose goal is, rather than solely collecting credit card informa-
tion or banking credentials, to provide the information needed to
replicate the user profiles of the infected victims across the online
platforms on which affected users are active. The malware distri-
bution is independent from the IMPaaS model: it can be delivered
through phishing campaigns, targeted attacks, pay-per-install [10]
or exploitation-as-a-service infrastructures [20]. Through the cho-
sen attack vector, the attacker installs on the victim system custom
malware engineered to collect user credentials and cookies from
the victim’s browsers; the custom malware further collects a large
set of technical and (user) behavioral information that can be repli-
cated, by means of the infrastructure itself, to fully emulate the
user; these include the fingerprint(s) of the victim’s browser(s) and
other behavioral metadata that uniquely identify the user, such
as network activity, browser history, cookie data, and interactions
with the user interface of the platform. As profiles are fetched by
means of a persistent malware infection, the infrastructure can
provide updates of the profile data and credentials for each affected
user. The harvested profiles and the respective updates are then
pushed to the IMPaaS servers.
Profile selection. An IMPaaS operator provides the harvested user
profiles to interested attackers via a dedicated marketplace. The mar-
ketplace provides an overview of the characteristics of the collected
profiles available for purchase, such that the attacker can select
which profiles best fit their goal by searching for victim profiles

MODEL
In this paper we describe evidence of a new emerging attack model,
namely Impersonation-as-a-Service (IMPaaS for short), and the crim-
inal infrastructure supporting it.
IMPaaS directly addresses the main limitations of the ‘traditional’
impersonation attack strategies highlighted above by moving the ac-
quisition and enforcement of victim profiles from an ad-hoc process
to a systematic one. An overview of the comparison between IMPaaS
and current vectors for impersonation attacks is summarized in Ta-
ble 1. Figure 1 provides a birds’ eye view of the attack process, from
profile acquisition, to selection and enforcement. IMPaaS operators
rely on widespread malware infections to acquire ‘user profiles’
globally, and provide these profiles as ‘goods’ via the underground
economy through a dedicated marketplace. As a result, attackers
can acquire systematic access to a large set of user profiles span-
ning multiple platforms (social networks, email, corporate accounts,
banking/cryptocurrency, etc.), alongside associated credentials and
cookies; attackers can select the profiles they are most interested in
based on a number of features, including the geographic location
linked to the profile, the platforms for which impersonation data

web services for which stolen credentials are available, presence of
cookies, etc. Albeit less targeted than allowed by a spear-phishing
attack scenario, the selection procedure allows for a high degree of
precision on the characteristics and/or environment of the user. For
example, by browsing though the available credentials it is possible
to identify users operating in a specific environment (e.g. a specific
corporation, university, or other organizations), or with profiles on
platforms of interest to the attacker. Once an attacker has identified
their victim(s), the attacker can then proceed to buy the selected
profiles. This can be achieved through the usual payment methods
adopted in the cybercrime markets, such as via cryptocurrency pay-
ments to the marketplace, and/or by relaying the payment through
a third-party escrow service. Importantly, as each profile can be
purchased individually, the IMPaaS platform is in the position of
removing purchased profiles from the marketplace listings, thus
potentially reassuring the customer that they are the only one (next
to the platform operators) with access to that profile.
Profile enforcement. The IMPaaS platform provides their cus-
tomers with a customized software bundle that includes a custom
browser (based on open-source projects) and a browser extension
that allows attackers to fetch and ‘enforce’ the purchased user
profiles during the attacker’s browsing session on that platform.
Based on the profiles selected and purchased by the attacker, the
software provided by the IMPaaS platform recreates a browsing
environment that replicates the victim’s environment by instantiat-
ing exact copies of the stolen cookies and user credentials, and by
spoofing other information on the victims’ systems (e.g., installed
fonts/plugins, browser agent, ...). Further, the profile enforcement
system provides cookies that embed behavioral metadata derived
from the victim [12] without requiring explicit action from the
attacker, and provides SOCKS5 proxy solutions to spoof the usual
geographic location of the victim.
4 CHARACTERIZING IMPAAS IN THE WILD
In this section, we describe the operations of an emergent, invite-
1. The platform has operated
only IMPaaS platform, ImpaaS.ru
since late 2016 and grew considerably, in terms of available user
profiles, in 2019. At the time of writing, ImpaaS.ru provides ap-
proximately 260′000 (and growing) user profiles available for im-
personation attacks against Internet users worldwide. ImpaaS.ru
is a Russian IMPaaS platform reachable from the surface web. This
platform is, to the best of our knowledge, the first, large IMPaaS
operator operating in the underground. On ImpaaS.ru, a user pro-
file contains information coming from user systems infected with a
credential stealer custom malware acting as a man-in-the-browser.
The custom malware enables the exfiltration of cookies, creden-
tials and sniffing of keystrokes, alongside additional environmental
and device information that uniquely characterize the user. The
IMPaaS platform states user profiles are updated and pushed to the
attacker’s system in real-time, and that sold user profiles are re-
moved from the listings of profiles available for purchase, although
1We do not disclose the real name of the IMPaaS platform to minimize the risk of
retaliatory actions from the market operators.
this is difficult to verify empirically, and ethically.2 An overview
of the profile characteristics is provided to browsing customers;
profiles with specific characteristics can be searched through the
marketplace interface. From the platform, it is possible to access
the list of bought profiles and download the related fingerprint. Fur-
ther, ImpaaS.ru provides their customers with a custom chromium-
based browser plugin and a pre-built version of Chromium for both
macOS, Linux and Windows. This bundle can be accessed only after
having bought at least one user profile on the platform. The plugin
comes with the capability of loading fingerprints previously ob-
tained from the acquired profiles and can tunnel the traffic through
an attacker-specified SOCKS5 proxy to spoof a victim’s geolocation.
Malware customization. The latest known custom malware em-
ployed by ImpaaS.ru is based on the AZORult malware [6, 13, 19].
ImpaaS.ru reports a recent update (Nov 2019) in AZORult address-
ing changes introduced in the Chrome browser that appear to
have affected the malware functionality. Confirmation of massive
phishing campaigns in that period associated with AZORult come
independently from Kaspersky and other researchers [6, 19, 30].
Note that, start of 2020, AZORult was abandoned by ImpaaS.ru in
favour of a new (and, at the time of writing, still unnamed), custom
malware. Due to the changing nature of the adopted malware, we
here only provide a high-level overview of AZORult operations
from samples available (at the time of data collection) in the under-
ground and malware repositories. For our analysis we replicated
the latest three versions of AZORult (at the time of writing 3.3, 3.4.1
and 3.4.2) in a virtual environment, with the aim of evaluating its
overall functionalities and their relevance to ImpaaS.ru. Malware
customization happens through two modules, namely the builder
and the C2 server. The builder has the purpose of generating the
custom build of AZORult including the URL of the C2 server. The
C2 server module is a ready-to-deploy web service providing an
overview of the harvested data and a page for setting up the fea-
tures of the malware; these features are user-defined, and include
the collection of browser history, saved passwords, cryptocurrency
client files, Skype history, a customizable regexp-based file grabber
targeting user-defined folders on the infected host, and an addi-
tional setup for the deployment of a second stage infection on the
victim system: as AZORult removes itself from the system after
execution, the second-stage mechanism can allow ImpaaS.ru op-
erators to obtain persistence on the infected system and further
refine the data collection (e.g., to harvest behavioral data over time,
see profile updates analysed in Sec 5).
4.1 Platform infiltration
Access to ImpaaS.ru is invite-only, and a valid account is needed
to access the listings of available user profiles. Access to the reg-
istration procedure is provided through invite codes available to
members already active on the platform, provided they spent at least
20 USD in purchased user profiles. To gain access to ImpaaS.ru
we probed several underground forums in which we have a pre-
existent foothold, and identified users that claim to be involved
with ImpaaS.ru. As recent evidence suggests that underground
2A proposition is to infect one’s own system and purchase back the generated profile
to verify its disappearance. As the malware employed by the platform is custom,
reproducibility is non-trivial. See also Sec 4.
platform operators are actively monitoring and blacklisting ‘rogue’
accounts (e.g., performing scraping activities) [11], we aimed at
the collection of several valid accounts prior to data collection to
distribute the activity and have ‘backup’ identities to use if some
of our accounts were to be blacklisted. Our search lead us to six
members in Torum and one member in Crdclub (who claimed to be
one of the operators of ImpaaS.ru) that were offering free invite
codes between December 2019 and March 2020. We contacted them
through the private messaging facility of the forums as well as on
the messaging board, and obtained valid invitation codes from three
of them in Torum. From Crdclub we gained access to an additional
eight valid invitation codes using separate (and active) identities
on the forum, for a total of eleven ImpaaS.ru accounts overall.
4.2 User profiles on ImpaaS.ru
ImpaaS.ru offers an overview of the available profiles, highlighting
the information bundled in that user profile. A view of the interface
accessed by attackers is provided in Figure 11 and Figure 10 in
the Appendix. It is worth to note that, whereas ImpaaS.ru listings
do not readily provide identifying information on the user, the
information available on a listing is detailed enough to identify
users operating in specific target environments such as a specific
organization (e.g., to then perform lateral attacks [25]). ImpaaS.ru
distinguishes between the following information in a user’s profile:
cookies, resources and fingerprints.
Cookies. These are the cookies captured by the custom malware
and available for injection toward the respective platforms once
the user profile is purchased and enforced by the attacker.
Resources. Resources are collections of data derived from key-
logging activity and probing of browser’s local resources, such
as the database of stored passwords, and browser history. Some
well-known resources (e.g., related to social media platforms, home
banking, etc.) are highlighted as known resources by the platform,
suggesting that the type of extracted Resources is an important
information for the attacker to consider. A resource can include mul-
tiple data reporting login credentials, answers to security questions,
detailed balance info for bank accounts, credit/debit card numbers
and holder details. ImpaaS.ru states that the malware extracts
Resources from infected systems through three main modules:
FormParser reads the contents of the form data inputted by the
user; SavedLogins gathers credentials saved in the browser’s local
database; InjectScript implements code injection on the victim’s
browser on behalf of the attacker, but its operation is unclear and
most of the listed profiles do not appear to rely on it.
Fingerprints. Fingerprints provide a collection of the features
exposed by a browser when interacting with RBA systems, ranging
from technical metadata (user-agents, browser version) to more
finely grained features (geolocation, latency, system language, fonts
installed, web site device access permissions, etc.)3. Depending on
the specific RBA implementation, a service may probe a specific sub-
set of the features characterizing a browser or system. Differently
from Resources (which are tied to a specific service, e.g. a user-
name/password combination on Amazon), the features collected
in an ImpaaS.ru fingerprint are not bounded to a specific service,
but to the browser environment itself (e.g., available system fonts,
or installed plugins). Therefore, these constitute a pool of features
that can be requested by any service, when available. ImpaaS.ru
distinguishes between two types of Fingerprints:
(1) Real fingerprints: these are directly collected from the vic-
tim’s device, providing an accurate identity of the imperson-
ated device; albeit rarely available in bots, they appear to be
sought after by market users;
(2) Synthetic fingerprints: these fingerprints are generated
on the basis of the data collected by the malware. How-
ever, accurate ‘synthetic’ fingerprints cannot be generated
without user data (e.g, system fonts, plugins installed in a
browser, etc.). For this reason, we consider the availability
of Resources and of browser data in a user profile as an in-
dication that the malware is in the position of collecting the
necessary data to generate a reliable synthetic fingerprint.
4.3 Data collection strategy
To collect data on ImpaaS.ru operations, we first consider a number
of structural limitations at the core to our sampling strategy:
Lim-1 To avoid disclosing our identity to the ImpaaS.ru operators,
we perform the scraping behind TOR. This poses technical
limits (as well as ethical concerns) for bandwidth usage.
Lim-2 We have a limited number of accounts to perform our mea-
surements; aggressive probing risks exposing our accounts
to the ImpaaS.ru operators, and lead to blacklisting.
Lim-3 Information on Resources cannot be accessed in bulk via
an API or other requests to ImpaaS.ru, but rather have
to be requested in limited bundles with separate requests.
This explodes the number of requests necessary to obtain
Resources information on all user profiles on ImpaaS.ru.
To address Lim-1 and Lim-2, we employ an ad-hoc crawler. Ini-
tially the crawler was set to work ≈ 24h/day issuing, on average,
15 requests per minute; despite the relatively low requests volume,
this strategy led two of our accounts to be blacklisted, suggesting
that ImpaaS.ru operators may be employing network monitoring
solutions to avoid measurement activities. Following [11], we pro-
gressively reduced the crawling activity to ≈ 6h/day. In the process,
an additional three accounts were banned, for a total of five banned
accounts. It is interesting to note that three of the five blocked
