### How to Check if a Tornado Application is Listening on a Specific URL

If you need to manage multiple URLs for different games in a Tornado application, and you want to ensure that a URL is not already being listened to before adding a new handler, it's important to understand that Tornado does not provide a public interface to directly check if a specific path is mapped.

#### Recommended Approach
Instead of dynamically adding handlers after the application has started, which is generally not recommended, you can use a more flexible approach:

1. **Use a Wildcard Rule:**
   Define a wildcard rule in your `Tornado` application that captures all game-related URLs. For example:
   ```python
   from tornado.web import Application, RequestHandler, HTTPError

   class GameHandler(RequestHandler):
       def get(self, game_id):
           # Check if the game exists
           if self.is_game_valid(game_id):
               # Handle the request for the game
               self.write(f"Handling request for game {game_id}")
           else:
               raise HTTPError(404, f"Game {game_id} not found")

       def is_game_valid(self, game_id):
           # Implement your logic to check if the game exists
           # For example, you might query a database or a dictionary
           return game_id in self.application.games

   app = Application([
       (r'/game/(.*)', GameHandler),
   ])

   # Example: Storing a list of valid game IDs
   app.games = ['game1', 'game2', 'game3']

   app.listen(8888)
   ```

2. **Check Game Existence in the Handler:**
   In the `GameHandler`, implement a method to check if the requested game exists. If the game does not exist, raise an `HTTPError` with a 404 status code.

#### Why This Approach?
- **Simplicity:** You avoid the complexity of dynamically adding and checking handlers.
- **Flexibility:** The wildcard rule allows you to handle any number of games without modifying the application's routing.
- **Maintainability:** Your application remains clean and easy to maintain, as all game-related logic is centralized in the `GameHandler`.

By following this approach, you can efficiently manage multiple game URLs without the need to check if a URL is already being listened to.
