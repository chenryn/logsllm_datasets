User: How to check if application in Tornado listen some url ?
I need to listen lot off urls, for new game I create new and add programmatically handler for that url, but I first need to check. How to check if Tornado already listen url?
Assistant: There is no public interface to find out whether a path is currently mapped in a Tornado Application.  In general, you shouldn't be calling add_handlers after startup anyway - instead, add a wildcard rule (like (r'/game/(.*)', GameHandler)) and then in GameHandler you can check whether the requested game exists or not (and if not, raise HTTPError(404)).
