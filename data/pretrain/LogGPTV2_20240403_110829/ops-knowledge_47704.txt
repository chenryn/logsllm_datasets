Question: In a system that employs XOR-based symmetric-key encryption, a developer has written the following code snippet to manipulate a bit sequence (represented as 'y'). Identify which operation will not result in the expected outcome based on the properties of XOR.
"A": "y = y ^ 0; // Expectation: y remains unchanged.",
"B": "y = y ^ y; // Expectation: y becomes all 0s.",
"C": "y = y ^ 1; // Expectation: All bits of y are flipped.",
"D": "y = (y ^ 1) ^ 1; // Expectation: y becomes all 1s."
Answer: D
