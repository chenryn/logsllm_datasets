Currently, when exporting markdown to html, all html special characters are
escaped:
    using Markdown
    a = Markdown.parse("This is *important* text with html in it");
    # parsed as
    Markdown.Paragraph(Any["This is ", Markdown.Italic(Any["important"]), " text with html in it"])
    # then exporting to html
    Markdown.html(a)
    # output below
    "This is important text with &lt;i&gt;html&lt;/i&gt; in it\n"
and there is no way of getting such an output:
    This is important text with html in it
So, this issue is a feature request.
It could even be the default behavior for all markdown blocks except code
block.
