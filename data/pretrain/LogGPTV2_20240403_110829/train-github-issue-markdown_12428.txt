I'm moving this issue here from codeplex:  
https://typescript.codeplex.com/workitem/1414
This feature would help to use "library projects" in a way that you only have
to specify the actual path once (eg. with a compiler flag).
I'd love to see this implemented in the official compiler. I think it's small
work and adds huge value.  
I can have a try at adding this but I'd value some guidelines on how to edit
the compiler and how it would make it's way to be part of the official
compiler.
