## Hacking Humans - The Traditional Way
### Social Engineering 101
- **Definition:** Social Engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of people into performing actions or divulging information.
- **Common Influencing Tactics:**
  - **Context-Specific Factors:** Attackers exploit patterns that targets are comfortable with, depending on the nature of their work.
  - **Scarcity:** Creating a sense of urgency to manipulate decision-making processes.
  - **Authority:** Claiming to be from an individual or community with the right to exercise power.
- **Sources:**
  - Emma J. Williams, "Exploring susceptibility to phishing in the workplace," 2018

### Common Attack Vectors
- **Email Phishing**
- **Voice Phishing (Vishing)**
- **In-person/Physical Social Engineering**

### Human Vulnerability
- **Statistics:**
  - 43% of users fell for simulated spear-phishing emails. (Tian Lin et al., 2019)
  - 19.8% of employees clicked on phishing email links even after receiving phishing-related training. (Terranova Security, 2020)

## Typical Red Team Operation
### Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- **Data Sources:** LinkedIn Profiles, Twitter Profiles, Blog Posts
- **Tools:** Open-source tools

### Crafting Phishing Content
- **Steps:**
  - Analyze and contextualize the information
  - Brainstorm, innovate, and create pretext

### Challenges in Phishing
- **Effort and Time:**
  - Contextualizing and ideation
  - Analyzing results from OSINT
  - Generating usable phishing pretexts
- **Behavioral Analysis and Text Generation:**
  - Time and effort increase exponentially for spear phishing with each new target

## The AI Market Landscape
- **Staying Trendy:** Keeping up with the latest trends helps in improving hacking techniques.

### AI as a Service (AIaaS)
- **Definition:** AIaaS refers to companies providing out-of-the-box AI solutions.
- **Source:** MonkeyLearn

### AI for Human Resources
- **Example:** Snippet from Humantic AI’s Predictive Personality Insights
  - **Type:** High calculativeness
  - **Description:** Logical thinking, values facts over feelings, prefers working independently.
  - **Personalized Email Subject:** "A role that would move your career graph up"
  - **Adjectives:** Analytical, Objective Thinker, Quality Focused

### Unleashing OpenAI’s GPT-3 API
- **Accessibility:**
  - **Time:** <1 minute
  - **Cost:** $0.06 per 1k tokens
  - **Data Size:** Negligible
  - **Compute:** Negligible
  - **Energy:** Negligible
  - **Released:** 2020
- **GPT-3 Models:**
  - **Davinci Instruct:** Fine-tuned for plaintext instructions, built on Davinci model.
  - **Ada, Babbage, Curie:** Lower compute, faster response, less complexity.
  - **Davinci:** Slower response, higher cost, most capable.

### OpenAI’s GPT-3 Capabilities
- **Example Outputs:**
  - **Form Update Email:**
    - "Dear John Doe, I hope you are doing well. I am writing to inform you about updates to our company's policies. To work remotely, please fill out the online form."
  - **Employee Survey Invitation:**
    - "Dear John Doe, We invite you to participate in our annual employee survey. It is anonymous and will take about 10 minutes to complete."

## Hacking Humans - The AI Way
### Applying AI as a Service
- **Phishing Delivery Process:**
  - **Raw OSINT Data Sources:** LinkedIn, Twitter, Blog Posts
  - **Applying Humantic AI:** Personalized communication advice
  - **Parsing to Plaintext:** Structuring the data for use
  - **Reviewing Output from GPT-3:**
    - Example: "Dear John, I am writing to inquire if you are interested in exploring a career opportunity with us. Our company is known for its innovations in software, hardware, and cloud-based services."

### Experimental Results
- **Experiments:**
  - **Type 1:** Effectiveness of convincing targets to click on phishing links.
    - Each target receives 2 emails (one AI-generated, one manually generated).
  - **Type 2:** Effectiveness of convincing targets to open “malicious” documents.
    - Target group divided into 2 groups (one receiving AI-generated content, the other manual).

## Conclusion
- **Summary:**
  - Traditional social engineering tactics and their effectiveness.
  - The role of AI in enhancing phishing and social engineering attacks.
  - Importance of staying updated with AI trends to improve defensive strategies.
