OpenAI’s GPT3 has a temperature parameter (“Temperature”) which controls the randomness. Lowering the parameter 
will result the model becoming deterministic and repetitive. Thus, by repeatedly submitting the same set of inputs, a 
different set of output will be produced.
The output above are produced from the same set of input instructions

2 different types of experiments over a period of 3 months, with over 200 targets 
across multiple authorised phishing exercises:
●
Type 1: To investigate the effectiveness of convincing targets to click on 
phishing links in phishing emails
For Type 1 experiments, each target receives 2 emails (one will be generated by AI, while the other 
generated manually by a red team operator).
●
Type 2: To investigate the effectiveness of convincing targets to open 
“malicious” documents in phishing emails
For Type 2 experiments, the target group is divided into 2 groups. One group will receive AI generated
