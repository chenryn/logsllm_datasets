User: I am trying to figure out how to get a process to ignore SIGKILL. The way I understand it, this isn't normally possible. My idea is to get a process into the 'D' state permanently. I want to do this for testing purposes (the corner case isn't really reproducible). I'm not sure this is possible programatically (I don't want to go damage hardware). I'm working in C++ and Python, but any language should be fine. I have root access.
I don't have any code to show because I don't know how to get started with this, or if it's even possible. Could I possibly set up a bad NFS and try reading from it?
Apologies in advance if this is a duplicate question; I didn't find anyone else trying to induce the D state.
Many thanks.
Assistant: It is not possible to ignore SIGKILL or handle it in any way.
From man sigaction:

The sa_mask field specified in act is not allowed to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP.  Any attempt to do so will be silently ignored.
