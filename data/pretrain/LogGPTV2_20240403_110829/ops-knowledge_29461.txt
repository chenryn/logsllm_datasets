Question: "Consider the following scenarios where the Secure Enclave in Apple devices is employed. Select all scenarios that correctly describe the use of the Secure Enclave's features according to the information provided:"
 "A": "The Secure Enclave UID is used to cryptographically tie data to a particular device, making data from the internal SSD inaccessible if moved to another device."
 "B": "UID and GID can be accessed and retrieved through Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) interfaces for debugging purposes."
 "C": "The Secure Enclave AES Engine supports both hardware and software keys, with hardware keys derived from the UID or GID and never exposed to sepOS software."
 "D": "The Public Key Accelerator (PKA) executes asymmetric cryptography operations and is designed to prevent information leakage through timing and side-channel attacks such as SPA and DPA."
