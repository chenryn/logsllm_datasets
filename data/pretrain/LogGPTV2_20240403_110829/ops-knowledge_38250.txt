User: How to ensure system availability and improve user experience in high concurrency scenarios?
Assistant: 1. Use caching technology: cache hotspot data in memory, avoid querying the database for each request, and improve system response speed. 2. Load balancing technology: Distribute requests to multiple servers to avoid excessive load on a single server and improve system throughput and stability. 3. Asynchronous processing: use asynchronous processing methods such as message queues to distribute request processing to multiple threads or multiple nodes to improve request processing efficiency. 4. Database optimization: optimize the database by vertical or horizontal sub-database sub-table, etc., to avoid excessive access pressure on a single database and improve database access efficiency. 5. Preloading technology: preload key data, reduce the waiting time after the request arrives, and improve user experience. 6. Stress testing and monitoring technology: conduct stress testing, grasp system load limits and response bottlenecks, monitor system performance indicators in real time, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. 7. Virtualization technology: Adopt virtualization technologies such as cloud services to flexibly expand and shrink capacity to meet rapidly changing business needs in high-concurrency scenarios.
