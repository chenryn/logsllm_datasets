User: Please analyze the principle of Nginx as a load balancer, how to achieve session persistence?
Assistant: The principle of Nginx as a load balancer is based on the reverse proxy mechanism, which forwards the client's request to multiple back-end servers for processing. The specific process is as follows: 1. The client initiates a request, and the request is received by Nginx. 2. Nginx selects a backend server to process the request according to the pre-configured load balancing algorithm. 3. Nginx forwards the request to the selected backend server, and proxies the response result back to the client. In order to maintain sessions, Nginx usually uses the following two methods: 1. IP Hash: Calculate a hash value based on the client's IP address, and then select a backend server to process the request based on the hash value. This method can ensure that the request of the same client is always forwarded to the same server, so as to maintain the session. 2. Sticky Session: When the client requests for the first time, Nginx will assign a unique identifier to it, and then select a backend server to process the request based on the identifier. Subsequent requests from the same client will be forwarded to the previously allocated server to achieve session retention. It should be noted that Nginx only implements session persistence based on the HTTP protocol. For non-HTTP protocol requests, other methods are required to implement session persistence.
