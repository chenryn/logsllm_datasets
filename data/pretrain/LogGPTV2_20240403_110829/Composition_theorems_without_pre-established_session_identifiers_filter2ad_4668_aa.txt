## Abstract

Canetti’s universal composition theorem and the joint state composition theorems by Canetti and Rabin are valuable tools for the modular design and analysis of cryptographic protocols. However, these theorems assume that parties in a protocol session have pre-established unique session identifiers (SIDs). While using SIDs is a good design principle, many existing protocols, especially real-world security protocols, do not use pre-established SIDs, at least not explicitly and not in the manner required by the theorems. Consequently, these theorems cannot be applied to analyze such protocols in a modular and accurate way.

In this paper, we present universal and joint state composition theorems that do not require pre-established SIDs. Our joint state composition theorem uses an ideal functionality, Fcrypto, which supports various cryptographic operations, including public-key encryption, symmetric encryption (both authenticated and unauthenticated), MACs, digital signatures, and key derivation. This functionality has been shown to be realizable under standard cryptographic assumptions. We demonstrate the utility of our theorems through case studies on real-world security protocols, including IEEE 802.11i, SSL/TLS, SSH, IPsec, and EAP-PSK. Although our applications focus on real-world security protocols, our theorems, models, and techniques should be useful in other domains as well.

## 1. Introduction

Universal composition theorems, such as Canetti’s composition theorem in the UC model [7] and Küsters’ composition theorem in the IITM model [19], allow for the security analysis of multiple sessions of a protocol by examining just a single session. These theorems assume that different protocol sessions have disjoint states, particularly requiring each session to use fresh randomness. This can lead to inefficient and impractical protocols, as every session must use new long-term symmetric and public/private keys. Canetti and Rabin [11] proposed combining universal composition theorems with joint state composition theorems, allowing different sessions to share some state, such as the same long-term and public/private keys.

However, both universal and joint state composition theorems assume that parties participating in a protocol session have pre-established a unique session ID (SID). While the use of SIDs is a good design principle, many existing protocols, especially real-world security protocols, do not use pre-established SIDs, at least not explicitly and not in the specific manner required by the theorems. As a result, these theorems cannot be used for the accurate modular analysis of such protocols; at most, they can be used to analyze idealized variants, which is unsatisfactory and risky, as attacks on the original protocols might be missed.

The goal of this paper is to develop general universal and joint state composition theorems that do not require pre-established SIDs, enabling modular and accurate analysis of protocols without the need to modify or idealize them. Our main motivation comes from the analysis of real-world security protocols. Despite many attacks being uncovered, their comprehensive analysis remains challenging due to their complexity. Modular analysis is essential but should not compromise accuracy. Our composition theorems provide useful tools for this kind of modular and faithful analysis, applicable beyond real-world security protocols.

### Contributions of this Paper

1. **Universal Composition Theorem Without Pre-Established SIDs:**
   - If a protocol realizes an ideal functionality for a single session, it also realizes the ideal functionality for multiple sessions, subject to mild restrictions on the single-session simulator.
   - Users invoke protocol instances with locally chosen and managed SIDs, rather than pre-established SIDs. This provides a more common and convenient interface and frees the real protocol from the need to use pre-established SIDs, allowing for faithful modeling of existing protocols.

2. **Joint State Composition Theorem Without Pre-Established SIDs:**
   - We consider protocols that use the ideal crypto functionality Fcrypto, which supports various cryptographic operations.
   - Under a condition called implicit (session) disjointness, it suffices to show that the protocol realizes an ideal functionality for a single session to obtain security for multiple sessions, where all sessions may use the same Fcrypto.
   - Users again invoke protocol instances with locally chosen and managed SIDs, and the original protocol is not modified or idealized.

Given our theorems, real-world security protocols can be analyzed with high modularity and precision. Once implicit disjointness is established, single-session analysis suffices to obtain multi-session security for the original protocol. We demonstrate the usefulness of our theorems through case studies on real-world security protocols, including (sub-protocols of) IEEE 802.11i, SSL/TLS, SSH, IPsec, and EAP-PSK. We show that these protocols satisfy implicit disjointness, confirming that this property is satisfied by many real-world security protocols.

## 2. Simulation-Based Security

We briefly recall the framework of simulation-based security, following [19]. The general computational model is defined in terms of systems of interactive Turing machines. An interactive Turing machine (machine) is a probabilistic polynomial-time Turing machine with named input and output tapes. The names determine how different machines are connected in a system. A system \( S \) of machines is of the form \( S = M_1 | \cdots | M_k | !M'_{k'} \), where the \( M_i \) and \( M'_j \) are machines with disjoint input tape names. Machines in the scope of a bang operator can generate an unbounded number of copies, while others cannot. Systems with multiple copies of a machine are often needed for multi-party protocols or concurrent execution of multiple protocol instances.

Two systems \( P \) and \( Q \) are indistinguishable (\( P \equiv Q \)) if the difference in the probability that \( P \) outputs 1 and \( Q \) outputs 1 is negligible in the security parameter.

**Definition 1** ([19]): Let \( P \) and \( F \) be protocol systems with the same I/O interface, representing the real and ideal protocols, respectively. Then, \( P \) realizes \( F \) (\( P \leq F \)) if there exists an adversarial system \( S \) (a simulator or an ideal adversary) such that the systems \( P \) and \( S|F \) have the same external interface and for all environmental systems \( E \), connecting only to the external interface of \( P \) (and hence, \( S|F \)), it holds that \( E|P \equiv E|S|F \).
