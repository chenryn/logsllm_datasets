$ tortuosa concept – attacking attacker’s plan
While Mapping Noticed Something
~ Some defensive techniques appear most often – Invest!!!!
Progression disruption – Time
Build anomalies and fake targets with trips – Scope Creep
Deception of phase exit – Predecessor/Successor
~ Some strategies seem to have little payoff but high investment 
Don’t bang head here!!!!
~ This made sense!  Spending time buried in Cyber Resiliency Engineering 
Framework – This validated the findings and was common sense 
https://www.mitre.org/publications/technical-papers/cyber-resiliency-
engineering-framework

$ tortuosa concept – attacking attackers’ plan
Noticed something more…
~ ….maybe a game?
Got an Attacker Deck
Got a Defender Deck
Got a Progressive Board with Lockheed 
Martin Attack Lifecycle
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Board Game Mock Up – Attacker Red Deck – Defender Blue Deck
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Card Anatomy – Progression, Cost, Upkeep, Usage – Build a 
Story
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
60+ unique attacker cards and 70+ unique defender cards 
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
60+ unique attacker cards and 70+ unique defender cards 
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
12 unique threat actor chips – face down 
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
11 unique act on objectives – face down in middle 
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Game Board Mockup – General Rules
~ 3 Versions – Easy, Tactical, Strategic
~ Dealt cards (easy), actively pick cards 
(tactical) or buy cards (strategic)
~ Choose number of attacker players
~ Attackers choose their Threat Actor
~ Attackers choose their Act on Objectives
~ Attackers seek to get to Act on 
Objectives through progression to win
~ Defenders prevent progression from Act 
on Objectives
~ Defender wins if sets the attacker pieces  
back to Delivery 3 times or Recon 2 
times
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Game Board Mockup – Game Play – Yeah its playable!!!
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Use Cases
~ Education
Learn an Attack Life Cycle concept and make it part of a vocabulary
Build a security mindset in defenders who don’t do offense
~ Demonstration
Mini table top exercises
Defender practice - Investigator pattern recognition
Analysis and strategies for choosing technologies to win
Cost/Benefit analysis
~ Evangelism
Gamification as marketing
Helps to get the message to non security folks
$ build catalog of attack patterns – get more…
Mockup Done – Now Game Tweaks
~ Official Rules
Have general rules and game play 
~ More Cards
Missing certain cards in certain phases
More Opportunistic cards
~ Rationalization
Progression steps in a 1-6 effectiveness – Picked 6 because of a dice
Cost rationalization based on a 1000 seat company
~ Prior Art
Hacker, Hacker II, Ctrl-Alt-Hack, Elevation of Privilege, Exploits, 
STIXITS, Cyber Attribution Dice
No one has an Offensive and Defensive game play with a 
progressive board based on research
$ maelstrom – are you playing with a full deck?
Reaping Benefits Now
~ Example play for
MITRE and Mini Table Tops – MITRE’s 5th Cyber Resiliency Invitational 
(5/2015)
Current incidents with investigators
Mapping defensive strategies to technology choices – use case validation 
and development
~ Predicted products and spaces
Ramp up to PoC for startups coming out of stealth
Input for development work
~ Educational mechanism for some new team members – expanding 
concept
~ Built rich discussion for vendor feedback on products and feature 
requests
$ build catalog of attack patterns – get more…
Next Steps
~ Pursue
~ Submit work for upcoming CON talks, get input
~ Map to current attack patterns and developing patterns and play 
games
~ Played multiple rounds with investigators, red team members, engineers 
and others
~ Produce lessons from games
~ Digitizing and creating open source framework*** (wanna help?)
~ Expansion packs
~ Non-technical game development for kids (Spyder) 
~ Let others play and update their decks, watch their decks and collect 
strategies ;)
~ LASTLY, digitize and let the ‘Machine Rise and Play Itself’…

Agile SCRUM Methodology
Stories:
• Replays
• Snapshots
• Predecessors and Successors – feigning completion
Sprints : 
• Create resource unavailability – Maybe APT Team F uses AWS 
(during Team F stage block AWS)
• Create resource contention – Flood targets?
• Different teams using different tool sets
• Build Project Backlog:
• Change Priorities:
• Cost:  Increase Time and Backlog
