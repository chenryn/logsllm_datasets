I have been successfully using Ansible to manage 12 hosts without any issues. However, when I attempted to add a 13th host, I encountered an error that I had not seen before:

```
FAILED => failed to resolve remote temporary directory from $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889: `mkdir -p $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889 && chmod a+rx $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889 && echo $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889` returned empty string
```

My initial attempts to find a solution via Google were unsuccessful. Therefore, I decided to investigate the source code. I discovered that the `paramiko_ssh.py` script in the `ansible/runner/connection_plugins/` directory was not returning any response from the 13th host. The public key for this host was configured identically to the other 12, and I could SSH into it without a password. However, Paramiko was not returning any data.

After much troubleshooting, I came across a particularly useful Stack Overflow answer (http://stackoverflow.com/a/18472049/484661). This led me to understand that calling the `get_pty()` function on the Paramiko channel opened by `exec_command` was necessary to get the 13th host to return any data. Here is the relevant code snippet:

```python
def exec_command(self, cmd, tmp_path, sudo_user, sudoable=False, executable='/bin/sh'):
    ''' run a command on the remote host '''
    bufsize = 4096
    try:
        chan = self.ssh.get_transport().open_session()
        chan.get_pty()  # This line was added
    except Exception as e:
        msg = "Failed to open session"
        if str(e):
            msg += ": %s" % str(e)
        raise errors.AnsibleConnectionFailed(msg)
```

By adding the `chan.get_pty()` call, Ansible was able to work with the 13th host, and this change did not affect the functionality of the previous 12 hosts. While this issue appears to be more related to Paramiko, I believe it should be reported as an Ansible bug, as it can be worked around with the `get_pty()` function.
