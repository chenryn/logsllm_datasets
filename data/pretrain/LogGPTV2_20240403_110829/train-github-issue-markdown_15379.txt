I have been using Ansible on 12 hosts with no issues at all. For some reason,
when I tried to add the 13th host (lucky, lucky), the tool threw an error I
hadn't seen before:
    FAILED => failed to resolve remote temporary directory from 
    $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889: `mkdir -p 
    $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889 && chmod a+rx 
    $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889 && echo 
    $HOME/.ansible/tmp/ansible-1380135548.99-254800519176889` returned empty string
Google failed me utterly, so I did some digging through the source. I found
that the ansible/runner/connection_plugins/paramiko_ssh.py script simply
wasn't returning any response from the this host. The public key was set up
just like the other 12, and I was able to SSH in without a password, but
Paramiko just wouldn't return any data.
After much head scratching and discovering quite possibly the most usefully
arcane Stackoverflow response I've ever seen
(http://stackoverflow.com/a/18472049/484661), I found that that the only way
to get this particular host to return anything was by calling the get_pty()
function on the Paramiko channel that exec_command opens:
    178     def exec_command(self, cmd, tmp_path, sudo_user, sudoable=False, executable='/bin/sh'):
    179         ''' run a command on the remote host '''
    180     
    181         bufsize = 4096
    182         try:
    183             chan = self.ssh.get_transport().open_session()
    184             chan.get_pty()
    185         except Exception, e:
    186             msg = "Failed to open session"
    187             if len(str(e)) > 0:
    188                 msg += ": %s" % str(e)
    189             raise errors.AnsibleConnectionFailed(msg)
Adding this made Ansible work with this host, and it did not cause any issue
with the previous 12. I realize this is more of a Paramiko issue than an
Ansible one, but I figured this should be reported as an Ansible bug for now
since you can work around it with the get_pty() function.
