## Building and Installing  
### Linux and macOS  
The module can be built using the PGXS framework:  
- Unpack the file archive in a suitable directory.  
- Ensure the PATH environment variable includes the directory containing the  
  pg_config binary for the PostgreSQL installation you wish to build against.  
- Compile and install the code.  
For example:  
    tar -zxvf system_stats-1.0.tar.gz  
    cd system_stats-1.0  
    PATH="/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH" make USE_PGXS=1  
    sudo PATH="/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH" make install USE_PGXS=1  
### Windows  
The module built using the Visual Studio project file:  
- Unpack the extensions files in $PGSRC/contrib/system_stats  
- Set PG_INCLUDE_DIR and PG_LIB_DIR environment variables to make sure the  
  PostgreSQL include and lib directories can be found for compilation. For  
  example:  
        PG_INCLUDE_DIR=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\include  
        PG_LIB_DIR=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\lib  
- Open the Visual Studio project file "system_stats.vcxproj" and build the  
  project.  
### Installing the Extension  
Once the code has been built and installed, you can install the extension in  
a database using the following SQL command:  
    CREATE EXTENSION system_stats;  
### Security  
Due to the nature of the information returned by these functions, access is  
restricted to superusers and members of the monitor_system_stats role which  
will be created when the extension is installed. monitor_system_stats role  
will not be removed during drop extension. To allow users to access  
the functions without granting them superuser access, add them to the  
monitor_system_stats role. For example:  
    GRANT monitor_system_stats to nagios;  
## Functions  
The following functions are provided to fetch system level statistics for all  
platforms.  
### pg_sys_os_info  
This interface allows the user to get operating system statistics.  
### pg_sys_cpu_info  
This interface allows the user to get CPU information.  
### pg_sys_cpu_usage_info  
This interface allows the user to get CPU usage information. Values are a  
percentage of time spent by CPUs for all operations.  
### pg_sys_memory_info  
This interface allows the user to get memory usage information. All the values  
are in bytes.  
### pg_sys_io_analysis_info  
This interface allows the user to get an I/O analysis of block devices.  
### pg_sys_disk_info  
This interface allows the user to get the disk information.  
### pg_sys_load_avg_info  
This interface allows the user to get the average load of the system over 1, 5,  
10 and 15 minute intervals.  
### pg_sys_process_info  
This interface allows the user to get process information.  
### pg_sys_network_info  
This interface allows the user to get network interface information.  
### pg_sys_cpu_memory_by_process  
This interface allows the user to get the CPU and memory information for each  
process ID.  
NOTE: macOS does not allow access to to process information for other users.  
      e.g. If the database server is running as the postgres user, this function  
      will fetch information only for processes owned by the postgres user.  
      Other processes will be listed and include only the process ID and name;  
      other columns will be NULL.
