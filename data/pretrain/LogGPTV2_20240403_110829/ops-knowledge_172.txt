User: Basically I am coding websites in PHP from last year.
But now I want to use something else and GAE looks a good option.
So I want to know if GAE is good for making a little website to share favorite youtube videos ?
I have done single website in Python+Django few months back, it looks good to me.
But JAVA is the language that I want to learn too (never coded in JAVA since School days ).
Phew, it is hard to choose, so I need opinions !!
Specifically : Want to know if any glitch/problem in using either python or Java under GAE. Or if GAE is preferred or not. Not gonna make website for learning only, it will be for a client.
Assistant: Most people here are missing the fact that the question is really about App Engine, not java or python in general.
The Java and Python SDKs and App Engine runtimes have pretty much the same abilities at this point.  One caveat with the current java runtime is that if you use a lot of external libraries, your loading hits (the first time someone hits your website, and app engine has to spin up your app) can be a bit slow.
