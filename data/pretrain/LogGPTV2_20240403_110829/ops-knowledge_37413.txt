**Question:**
Does anyone know where or how to set the default save path/directory for Python scripts before running them? On a Mac, it defaults to saving them in the top-level `~/Documents` directory. I would like to specify a different location. Any ideas?

**Answer:**
For Windows 10 and later, you can set the default save directory for Python scripts in IDLE as follows:

1. Click the Windows Start button.
2. Type "IDLE" in the search bar.
3. Right-click on the IDLE desktop app and select "Open file location." This will take you to the Start Menu shortcuts for Python.
4. In the folder that opens, find the shortcut for IDLE.
5. Right-click on the IDLE shortcut and select "Properties."
6. In the Properties window, locate the "Start in" field.
7. Enter the desired directory path in the "Start in" field. This will be the default save location for your Python scripts when you open IDLE.

By following these steps, you can specify a custom directory for saving your Python scripts.
