User: Does anyone know where or how to set the default path/directory on saving python scripts prior to running?  
On a Mac it wants to save them in the top level ~/Documents directory. I would like to specify a real location. Any ideas?
Assistant: In Windows 10+, click the Windows Start button, then type idle, and then right-click on the IDLE desktop app and open the file location. This should bring you to the Start Menu shortcuts for Python, and you'll find a shortcut to IDLE there. Right-click on the IDLE shortcut and select properties. Set the "Start in" directory to be where you want default save path to be.
