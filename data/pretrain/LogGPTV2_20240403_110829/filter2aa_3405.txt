Human Sleep
Sleep is a normal state of rest that is 
characterized by unconsciousness, reduced 
activity, and limited sensory responsiveness
Sleep differs from other states of reduced 
consciousness such as drug intoxication or 
coma, because it is spontaneous, periodic, 
and readily reversible 
Wakefulness is characterized by consciousness, 
sensory responsiveness, and purposeful 
activity
Sleep in Non-Humans
Some animals never exhibit a state that meets the 
behavioral definition of sleep
Some marine mammal species do not show evidence 
for REM sleep, and convincing evidence for this 
state in reptiles, fish and insects is lacking
The enormous variation in the nature of rest and 
sleep states across the animal kingdom and within 
the mammalian class has important implications 
for understanding the evolution and functions of 
sleep
Discovery of REM
REM was discovered by accident in 1952
The discovery of REM sleep was the single event 
that hallmarked the onset of the modern era of 
sleep research
Researchers have yet to agree on the function of 
REM
Stages of Sleep
Four Non-REM Stages of Sleep 
REM Stage
Wakefulness
Sleeping and Waking
Biological Clock
Circadian Rhythm
Homeostatic Sleep Propensity
Incandescent Light
The first incandescent electric light was made in 
the 1800's 
Electric light can affect circadian rhythm
Circadian rhythm disruptions may be a cause of 
health problems
Aging and Sleep
The patterns of REM and NREM sleep show 
developmental changes as we age
As children grow, they sleep for longer periods at 
a time, with fewer sleep periods in a day, until 
achieving the adult pattern of a single sleep period 
each day
In most adults, the amount of nightly sleep 
remains fairly stable until old age
Larks and Owls
Chronotype
Moring Larks 
Evening Owls
Sleep Debt
Sleep debt is the cumulative effect of not getting 
enough sleep
There are two kinds of sleep debt caused by 
partial sleep deprivation or total sleep deprivation
There is debate in the scientific community over 
the specifics of sleep debt
Current Theories on Sleep
The physiological purpose of sleep continues to 
be something of a mystery
Theory of sleep as a restorative function
Theory of sleep an adaptive function
Sleep Disorders
The quality and quantity of sleep are important 
indicators of overall health
Sleep disorders can be classified into lack of 
sleep, disturbed sleep, and excessive sleep
Common sleep disorders
A Very Short History of Hypnotics
Chloral Hydrate
Bromide Salts
Barbiturates
Benzodiazepines
Non-Benzodiazepines
The Sleep Study
You go to sleep with electrodes attached to 
various points on your body
A computer records your brain waves, eye 
movement, muscle tension, and breathing patterns
A camera adjusted for low light and an audio-
recorder are also used
