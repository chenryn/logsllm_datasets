obtain  a  quantitative  estimate  of  the  reliability,  is
truly representative of the distribution of demands
that will be met in real system operation, and these
demands are statistically independent’.
In  both  these  examples,  the  reasoning  assumes  the
truth of the assumptions. If, as seems likely, there is some
doubt about the truth of the assumptions of an  argument
leg, this will change (reduce) the confidence that we have
in the claim. For the deterministic argument, B, we have
We now go out and collect evidence for the leg. That is
we  conduct  a  statistical  test,  e.g.  we  observe  4603
demands  under  conditions  that  satisfy  assA  (this  number
of  demands  is  chosen  so  that,  if  they  exhibit  no  failures,
we  shall  be  able  to  claim  that  the  system  has,  with  99%
confidence, a better than 10-3 pfd [12]). The evidence then
tells  us,  subject  to  the  truth  of  our  assumptions,  whether
that  leg  stands  or  falls  (i.e.  whether  we  succeed  in
executing  the  4603  demands  without  observing  a  failure,
or we fail). Denote by EA the event that the evidence for A
does in fact turn out to support the assertion GA:

where (cid:68) is 0.01. That is, we can say that the argument leg
A,  represented  by  the  triple (G A,   EA,  assA),  supports  the
claim  at  the  (1-(cid:68)(cid:12)(cid:3)level  of  confidence,  given  the  truth  of
the  assumptions  and  the  support  of  the  evidence.  More
precisely,  the  probability  of  the  claim  being  false,  given
the evidence is supportive and the assumptions are true, is
no greater than (cid:68).
The uncertainty in this kind of argument, which gives
rise to the doubt in the truth of the claim expressed in the
probabilistic  confidence  level,  comes  from  the  statistical
nature  of  the  evidence. Other  kinds  of  argument  may  be
completely deterministic, so that a claim can be expressed
with certainty assuming the truth of the assumptions. For
example, consider argument leg B:

As an example, if we were 99% confident in the truth
of  the  assumptions  underpinning  A,  then  (2)  shows  that
our  confidence  in  the  claim  GA  has  about  halved
compared  with  the  case  when  we  are  completely  certain
of  the  assumptions:  the  bound  (2)  is  approximately  0.02
compared with 0.01 from (1).6
Expression (2) shows the different roles played in this
example  by  extensiveness  of  evidence  and  assumption
confidence in arriving at the confidence level that can be
placed in the safety claim. By collecting more evidence of
6  When  we  say  that  our  confidence  is  halved,  we  mean  that  our
belief  in  the  falsity  of  the  claim  has  doubled.  This  is  similar  to
‘reliability’  studies,  where  probabilities  almost  always  relate  to
unreliabilities.  Whilst  our  discussion  in  the  paper  will  use  words  like
confidence, we shall almost always be dealing with such probabilities of
falsity or failure.

a  supportive  nature  (i.e.  observing  more  failure-free
demands of the protection system) we can reduce the value
of (cid:68)  and  thus  increase  our  confidence  in  the  claim.
However, our scope for doing this is restricted by the level
of  our  confidence  in  the  assumptions,  represented  by
(
) . There is clearly a limit to the value of collecting
P assA
more  evidence  of  the  same  kind  in  the  face  of  such
assumption uncertainty.
One interpretation of the reasoning behind requiring a
multi-legged argument is that it is a way to overcome, or
at least minimise, this problem. It is a means of increasing
our  confidence  in  G,  given  the  evidence,  when  we  have
doubts about the truth of the assumptions underpinning an
individual argument.

Figure 1. The structure of a two-legged argument in
support of a claim G
Consider the case of a two-legged argument like that of
Fig 1. This is very similar to a 1-out-of-2 system structure.
Just as there we would claim that the probability of failure
of  the  system  was  less  than  the  probability  of  failure  of
either  leg,  so  here  we  can  expect  that  the  chance  of
accepting  a  false  claim  will  be  less  with  the  two-legged
structure than it would be with either leg on its own.  The
detailed  way  in  which  confidence  in  the  claim  depends
upon  the  evidence  and  assumptions  can  be  seen  in  the
following expression:

We  shall  now  consider  some  simple  examples  to
illustrate how this works.
Example 1
Consider  the  case  where  each  of  the arguments  is  of
the  deterministic,  logical  type,  supporting  a  claim  for
impossibility of failure, like B above: call them B1, B2. We
have

Here  we  have  used  the  fact  that  in  this  type  of
argument,  if  either  of  the  assumptions  is  true,  and  the
evidence  supports  the  claim,  then  the  claim  is  true  with
certainty. Thus the first three terms of the right hand side
of (3) are zero. In addition, the bounding value assumes
conservatively that the claim is false with certainty if both
assumptions are false.
Clearly, there will be greater confidence in the claim,
G,  using the two-legged argument   compared with using
only one argument leg. The benefit will depend upon how
much smaller is the probability of both assumptions being
false,  compared  with  the  probabilities  of  single
assumptions being false.
Example 2
Consider  now  an  argument  involving  two  statistical
legs A1, A2, similar to A above. We have, from (3):
