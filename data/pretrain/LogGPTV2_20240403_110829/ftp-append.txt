**Applies to:**

- Windows Server 2012

**Description:**
The `append` command appends a local file to a file on the remote computer, using the current file type setting.

**Syntax:**
```
append <localfile> [remotefile]
```

**Parameters:**

- **<localfile>**: Specifies the local file to be appended.
- **[remotefile]**: Specifies the file on the remote computer to which the local file will be appended. If this parameter is omitted, the local file name will be used as the remote file name.

**Examples:**

1. To append `file1.txt` to `file2.txt` on the remote computer:
   ```
   append file1.txt file2.txt
   ```

2. To append the local `file1.txt` to a file named `file1.txt` on the remote computer:
   ```
   append file1.txt
   ```

This command is useful for adding content from a local file to an existing file on a remote server, ensuring that the data is appended rather than overwriting the remote file.
