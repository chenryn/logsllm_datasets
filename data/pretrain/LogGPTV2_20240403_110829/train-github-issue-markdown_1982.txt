### Description
JAX configures the root logger facility what is a little breaking behavior
since using JAX in a third-party application changes logging configuration of
the whole app! In my opinion, such side-effects are not desirable and should
be fixed.
    import logging, jax
    # The next line does nothing since the root logger is already created. We need
    # to reset the root logger with force=True option.
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
    logging.error('error')
    logging.info('info')
#### Expected output
    ERROR:root:error
    INFO:root:info
#### Actual output
    ERROR:root:error
