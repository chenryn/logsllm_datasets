I understand that you have installed Python 2.7.2 (32-bit) and Google App Engine (GAE) SDK 1.6.1 on a 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium system, with both software packages installed in their default folder locations. When attempting to run the "Hello World" project as outlined in the Google Python Getting Started documentation, you encountered an issue where the Launcher's "browse" button does not become active. It is worth noting that the GAE SDK should be compatible with Python 2.7.

### Troubleshooting Steps

#### 1. **Check for Hidden Characters in YAML File**
   - One possible cause of this issue could be hidden or special characters within your `app.yaml` file. These can sometimes be introduced when copying code from web pages.
   - To check for such characters, you can use a diff tool like KDiff3. Open your `app.yaml` file in KDiff3 and compare it with a known good version. If you find any unexpected characters, delete them and try running the project again.

#### 2. **Use the Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - The GAE Launcher GUI may not provide detailed error messages. For more comprehensive debugging, I recommend using the command line interface (CLI).
   - Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your `dev_appserver.py` script (usually located in the GAE SDK installation directory).
   - Run the following command:
     ```sh
     dev_appserver.py <path_to_your_project>
     ```
   - This will provide a detailed stack trace if there are any errors, which can help you identify and resolve the issue.

#### 3. **Environment Variables**
   - While environment variables are important, they are less likely to be the cause of the specific issue you are experiencing.
   - Ensure that your `PATH` environment variable includes the directory where Python is installed (e.g., `C:\Python27`).
   - You can add this to your `PATH` by following these steps:
     1. Right-click on "Computer" and select "Properties".
     2. Click on "Advanced system settings".
     3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
     4. In the "System variables" section, find the `Path` variable and click "Edit".
     5. Add `;C:\Python27` to the end of the existing value (make sure to include the semicolon as a separator).

### Summary
- **Hidden Characters:** Check your `app.yaml` file for any hidden or special characters and remove them.
- **Command Line Interface:** Use the CLI to run your project and get detailed error messages.
- **Environment Variables:** Ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the Python installation directory, but this is less likely to be the root cause of your issue.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide the error messages or stack traces, and I can assist you further.
