Not sure how the character got into my code but it does not show up in Atom
even with Show Invisibles set to true.
Info on the character can be found here

My specific issue: If this character comes after a CSS closing curly bracket,
all following styles are inaccessible and do not parse.
Example: https://jsfiddle.net/9tuy9w8o/2/  
Setting the image class to cat works but setting it to dog causes it to break.
