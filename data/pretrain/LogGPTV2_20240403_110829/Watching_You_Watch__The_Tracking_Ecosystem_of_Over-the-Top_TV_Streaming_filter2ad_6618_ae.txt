Fire TV: Fire TV provides a custom remote control API over
the network which allows a user to use their phone as the remote
control, which we analyzed in Appendix F.
6 DISCUSSION
Past research on user privacy expectations about smart TVs finds
that viewers find sharing of their data with advertisers unaccept-
able [41]. Our findings show that such concerned users have limited
options at their disposal. As emerging platforms, OTT services lack
tools, controls, and countermeasures available on the web and mo-
bile platforms. Users who enjoy installing adblockers for their web
browsers with just a few clicks often lack usable defenses to pro-
tect their video privacy on OTT platforms. Moreover, widespread
collection of persistent device identifiers like MAC addresses and
serial numbers disables one of the few defenses available to users:
resetting their advertising IDs. Trackers who collect persistent IDs
can link users’ activity even if they reset their AD IDs.
In addition, the tendency of companies to monetize users’ data
makes it difficult to incentivize privacy friendly practices. It is often
the role of regulators to keep platform and application developers
accountable. Our tool is an apt solution that can be used by regula-
tors to inspect channels and devices to enforce privacy regulations
on OTT platforms.
6.1 Recommendations
Based on our findings, we believe OTT vendors should borrow
ideas from other platforms, such as web, to provide a more privacy
friendly and secure experience to their users. Specifically, we make
the following recommendations based on our findings:
• OTT platforms should offer better privacy controls, sim-
ilar to Incognito/Private Browsing Mode of modern web
browsers. Platforms should ensure that linking of private
and non-private profiles of the same user is not possible by
partitioning identifiers and their storage along with denying
access to existing platform identifiers.
• Platforms should make it possible to monitor the content
of the network traffic, similar to browsers and operating
systems allowing intercepting one’s own traffic by installing
a self-signed certificate in the browser. This would allow
tech-savvy users and security researchers to analyze channel
behavior, leading to a more transparent ecosystem. These
features should require explicit user consent and display
their status prominently to mitigate the risk of use by one
user to spy on another user.
• To complement limited technical protections available to
users, regulators and policy makers should ensure the pri-
vacy protections8 available for brick and mortar video rental
services are updated to cover emerging OTT platforms, where—
as our research shows—users are constantly and pervasively
tracked.
• OTT platforms should introduce policies to disincentivize
insecure connections, for example, by blocking clear-text
connections unless an exception is requested by the channel
(similar to Apple’s App Transport Security feature[33]).
8e.g., the US Video Privacy Protection Act (“VPPA")

6.2 Limitations and Future Work
Below we discuss the limitations of our work and potential future
work to address these limitations.
6.2.1 Channel Login. Our crawler cannot go beyond login or signup
pages. This limitation, which is common among similar automation
tools, prevents us from reaching video playback on some channels.
As future work, we plan to integrate a real-time signal from an
image recognition script to detect, fill, and submit login forms dur-
ing crawls in order to increase the video playback rate. During the
manual crawl, we noticed some of the channels require sign up
through a web browser.
6.2.2 Background Traffic. Our traffic captures may contain back-
ground traffic from Roku and Amazon platforms. Based on our
preliminary analysis of the background traffic when no channel is
active, the effect on the results should be minimal. Distinguishing
background traffic for closed platforms like Roku is a problem we
plan to address in future studies.
Smart TV Platforms. We studied two of the most popular
6.2.3
OTT streaming devices, leaving out the smart TV platforms such as
Samsung, Vizio and Apple TV. We believe our automated crawler
can be easily modified to run experiments on these platforms, as
long as they have similar remote control APIs.
7 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented the first large scale study of tracking
by OTT streaming channels. Our measurement of the more than
2,000 OTT streaming channels revealed widespread user tracking
and data collection. To perform the study, we built a smart crawler
that automatically installs, launches, and interacts with the OTT
channels.
Our measurements showed that tracking is prevalent on the OTT
platforms we studied, with traffic to known trackers present on 69%
of Roku channels and 89% of Amazon Fire TV channels. We also
observed that certain OTT channels contact more than 60 tracking
domains and the data shared with the trackers include video titles,
WiFi SSIDs, MAC addresses and device serial numbers. Analyzing
the network data collected by our crawler, we discovered that 79%
of the Roku channels and 76% of the Fire TV channels send at least
one unencrypted HTTP request. Finally, we identified new tracking
domains not seen in previous tracking studies.
Our analysis of the available privacy countermeasures showed
that they are ineffective at preventing tracking. Such weak counter-
measures should be supported by policies and regulations to ensure
that users’ viewership information remains private.
