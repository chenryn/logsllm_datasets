While we did not see signiﬁcant diﬀerence in terms of 25 percentile and median
of the 107 cross covariance values, their average and 75 percentile could be useful.
Fig. 6 implies that a crafted attack pattern tends to exhibit a trend diﬀerent from
many of other customers’ consumption patterns. Even though this alone can not
be considered as deﬁnitive indication of attack, we could use it as an additional
factor for electricity theft detection leveraging alarm fusion technologies.
In addition to cross-correlation, we can use outlier detection algorithms such
as LOF [7], to identify outliers, exhibiting diﬀerent trends in their electricity con-
sumption patterns when compared to other similar consumers. In this direction,
we have conducted some preliminary analyses. We smoothed daily electricity
consumption patterns of a certain day in our dataset by using a low-pass ﬁlter.
Then we normalized them since our focus here is anomaly in terms of shape
and trends, not necessarily high or low consumption anomalies. Fig. 7 shows
some samples of consumption patterns with top-5 (greater than 2.4) and low
226

(less than 1.0) LOF scores. While inliers with low LOF scores are categorized
into a couple of “typical” usage patterns, like the one shown in Fig. 7(a), we can
identify unique patterns, including “artiﬁcially-looking” ones (Fig. 7(b)). We will
continue this area of research in future work.

5.2 Use of Auto-correlation of Residuals in ARMA-GLR Detector
Based on the deﬁnition of attack strategy we tested in Section 3.2, we can ex-
pect that the sequence of residuals of generated attack patters have high auto-
correlation, which can be a possible indication of attack. We have also explored
this direction.

One of the possible metrics to quantify such auto-correlation is the Durbin-
, where ei denotes the ith residual
Watson statistic, deﬁned as d =
and N is the number of measurements in the series. In general, we can infer that
there exists auto-correlation when d < 1.0. Following this idea, we added the test
of auto-correlation in residuals for the ARMA-GLR detector. Namely, for time-
series patterns that passed the GLR test, we apply the test based on Durbin-
Watson statistics. Using this approach we found that by setting the threshold
for d around 1.0, it can detect all of the attacks mounted against ARMA-GLR as
discussed in 3.2. The empirical relation between threshold values and the false
positive rate, where false positives are counted only based on Durbin-Watson
test (i.e. regardless of the result of ARMA-GLR test), is shown in Fig. 8(a).
Although we found that the use of Durbin-Watson statistics is eﬀective to
detect attacks against the ARMA-GLR detector, unfortunately it is not diﬃcult
to create attacks to defeat this other measure. For instance, a slightly modiﬁed
attack strategy shown below would give attackers almost the same gain as the
one he could do in case of the ARMA-GLR detector. When τ is the threshold
used for the ARMA-GLR test,

2. When i is an even number, send ˆYi = E0[Yi| ˆY1, . . . , ˆYi]− 2E. Otherwise, just
send ˆYi = E0[Yi| ˆY1, . . . , ˆYi].
This attack generates a sequence of residuals where 0 and 2E appear alterna-
tively and results in having d approximately 2.0, which implies that attack can
not be detected based on the threshold that is usually set around 1.0, while the
total gain of an attacker is almost equal. As can be seen in Fig. 8(b), the trade-
oﬀ curves are very similar. The weakness of the Durbin-Watson statistic is that
it only considers ﬁrst-order auto-correlation, so using higher-order correlation,
such as Breusch-Godfrey Test or Ljung-Box Test, would make attacks harder.
We will continue exploring ways to improve our detectors against sophisticated
attackers in future work.

5.3 Energy Eﬃciency
One of the goals of the smart grid is to give incentives for users to reduce their
electricity consumption. In some cases (such as the installation of solar panels),
the electric utility will know the consumer has installed these systems because
the utility has to send personnel to approve the installation and allow them to
sell electricity back to the grid. However, in some other cases, the incorpora-
tion of other green-energy technology might be unknown to the utility. In this
case any anomaly detection algorithm will raise a false alarm. The best we can
do is complement anomaly detection mechanisms with other information (e.g.,
balance meters) and in the case of false alarms, retrain new models with the
new equipment in place. These changes are part of the non-stationarity of the
random process we considered in this work.

6 Conclusions
In this paper we introduced the ﬁrst rigorous study of electricity-theft detection
from a computer-security perspective. While previous work has introduced other
methods for electricity-theft detection, we argue that the incorporation of a new
adversarial classiﬁcation metric, and new mechanisms that consider adversarial
learning are fundamental contributions to this growing area.
While all of the results in this paper consider pessimistic scenarios (the most-
powerful attacker), we anticipate that these algorithms will perform much bet-
ter under average cases where the attacker does not know the algorithms or time-
intervals we use for anomaly detection and where it may not be able to compute
optimal attack strategies. In addition, it is important to point out that the pro-
posed anomaly detectors will only output indicators of an attack: a utility com-
pany will not only look at time-series anomalies as sources of attacks, but also at
balance meters, smart meter tampering alarms, and might send personnel for pe-
riodic ﬁeld monitoring reports. Combining all this information will give the utility
good situational awareness of their network and accurate electricity-theft reports.
We plan to continue extending our work in multiple directions. For instance,
optimal attacks are often artiﬁcial: e.g., the attacks against our average detector
are constant values, therefore, adding additional mechanism that take advantage
of the “shape” of the signal would be eﬀective. We also plan to study more in-depth
cross-correlation among nearby customers as an indicator of anomalies. Another
approach to design classiﬁers resilient to attackers include the addition of random-
ness so the attacker cannot know at any time the state of the classiﬁer. One example
can be to leverage randomness in the use of training data, so an attacker would not
know the exact conﬁguration of the classiﬁer. Finally, as we obtain datasets con-
taining longer-periods of time, we plan to leverage accurate seasonal models and
correlation with other factors, such as weather and temperature.
