in stone by Satoshi, which we can call canonicalism. This
has mediated some disagreements about the speciﬁed rules,
such as a benign bug in the original OP_CHECKMULTISIG
opcode which has been preserved as canonical.
However, canonicalism cannot fully explain the current
rules of Bitcoin as changes have already been implemented
to add new features (e.g., pay-to-script-hash [2]). Rules have
also been modiﬁed to ﬁx bugs, with the best-known example
occurring in March 2013 when a bug limiting the size of
valid blocks was removed. This caused a fork as new, larger
blocks were rejected by unpatched clients. To resolve this,
the updated clients abandoned a 24-block fork and tem-
porarily ceased including larger blocks during a two-month
window for older clients to upgrade [1]. Eventually however,
the bug ﬁx won out and unpatched clients were eventually
excluded despite arguably implementing the canonical rules.
Within Bitcoin itself, no process is speciﬁed for updat-
ing transaction validation rules. Without unanimity among
miners, any change may permanently fork the system, with

different populations considering the longest blockchain
reﬂecting their interpretation of the rules to be authentic,
regardless of its length relative to other blockchains. At
this point, it would no longer be clear which version is
“Bitcoin.” Thus despite the popular conception of Bitcoin
as a fully decentralized system, the need for rule changes
(or disambiguation) means some level of governance is
inherently required to maintain real-world consensus about
which blockchain is considered Bitcoin [48], [64].
Currently, de facto governance is provided by the core
Bitcoin developers who maintain bitcoind, with the Bit-
coin Foundation providing a basic organizational structure
and raising a small amount of funding through donations to
support the development team. As with many early Internet
protocols, there is as of yet no formal process for making
decisions beyond rough consensus.
B. Stability of the consensus protocol
Assuming consensus on transaction validity rules, various
attempts have been made to describe the properties of the
consensus protocol which must hold for the blockchain to
be considered stable. We systematize properties proposed by
various analyses [46], [64], [84], [90] into ﬁve basic stability
properties. Note that these have been given different names
and different technical deﬁnitions by different authors, we
only give an informal overview here.
• Eventual consensus. At any time, all compliant nodes
will agree upon a preﬁx of what will become the eventual
valid blockchain. We cannot require that
the longest
chain at any moment is entirely a preﬁx of the eventual
blockchain, as blocks may be discarded (become “stale”)
due to temporary forks.
• Exponential convergence. The probability of a fork of
depth n is O(2−n). This gives users high conﬁdence that
a simple “k conﬁrmations” rule will ensure their transac-
tions are permanently included with high conﬁdence.
• Liveness. New blocks will continue to be added and valid
transactions with appropriate fees will be included in the
blockchain within a reasonable amount of time.
• Correctness. All blocks in the longest chain will only
include valid transactions.
• Fairness. On expectation, a miner with a proportion α of
the total computational power will mine a proportion ∼ α
of blocks (assuming they choose valid blocks).
If all of these properties hold we can say that the system
is stable, but it isn’t clear that all are necessarily required.
Users of the currency may be indifferent to the fairness
property, but this property is often assumed to hold and in
its absence many miners might cease to participate, which
could eventually threaten other stability properties.
Liveness is perhaps the hardest property to deﬁne and
to our knowledge there is no compelling formal deﬁnition.
Clearly, we would like anybody willing to pay to be able to
use the network, but it is not clear what exact requirements

in terms of transaction cost and inclusion time are reason-
able. Strict liveness also implies an anti-censorship property
which may not be required or even desirable to some, though
this is also often assumed to be a core property of Bitcoin.
Surprisingly, correctness is not actually required for a
functioning currency, as participants could simply disregard
any invalid transactions in the longest chain. However,
correctness enables an important performance beneﬁt in the
form of SPV clients which validate only proof-of-work and
not transactions (see Section IV-A).
Incentive compatibility and game theory. Nakamoto
originally argued that Bitcoin will remain stable as long
as all miners follow their own economic incentives [90],
a property called incentive compatibility. Incentive compat-
ibility has never been formally deﬁned in the context of
Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies; its prevalence as a term likely
stems from its intuitive appeal and marketing value. We can
consider compliant13 miners whose strategy is following the
default mining rules (see Section II-B2). In game-theoretic
terms, if universal compliance were shown to be a Nash
equilibrium, this would imply incentive compatibility for
Bitcoin as no miner would have any incentive to unilaterally
change strategy. This would imply a notion of weak stability
if other equilibria exist and strong stability if universal
compliance were the sole equilibrium. If on the other hand
non-compliant strategies dominate compliance, we must ask
whether the resulting strategy equilibrium leads to stability
for the consensus protocol.
1) Stability with bitcoin-denominated utility: We discuss
known results on Bitcoin stability, assuming that miners’
objective is purely obtaining nominal bitcoins.
it can then effectively mine unopposed until
Simple majority compliance may not ensure fairness.
An interesting non-compliant mining strategy is temporary
block withholding [11], [45], [46],14 in which a miner
initially keeps blocks secret after ﬁnding them. If the miner
ﬁnds itself two blocks ahead of the longest publicly-known
chain,
the
remainder of the network has caught up to within one block
at which point the withheld blocks can be published. For
a miner controlling at least α > 1/3 of the mining power,
this strategy dominates compliance because, when employed
against compliant miners, it results in a higher expected
share of the mining rewards. It may also be advantageous for
an attacker with lower levels of mining power depending on
how miners choose between near-simultaneously announced
blocks. An attacker with a privileged network position may
be able to announce their withheld blocks faster than rival
blocks, demonstrating that stability does inherently rely on
assumptions about the communication network.
While these results show that universal compliance is not
13This is sometimes called “honest” mining but we eschew this as non-
compliant strategies might also reasonably be considered honest.
14This attack strategy was called selﬁsh mining by Eyal and Sirer [45]
who were among the ﬁrst to analyze it.
a Nash equilibrium for many distributions of mining power,
including several that have been observed in practice, there
has been no evidence of a selﬁsh mining attack occurring
and it remains unknown what equilibria exist given the avail-
able strategy of temporary block withholding. If temporary
withholding were performed, this would undermine fairness.
Majority compliance is an equilibrium with perfect
information. Kroll et al. [64] analyzed a simpliﬁed model in
which miners have perfect information about all discovered
blocks (precluding any withholding). In this model, universal
compliance is a Nash Equilibrium (although not unique),
implying that Bitcoin is (weakly) stable.
Majority compliance implies convergence, consensus,
and liveness. It can be shown that with a majority of miners
behaving compliantly, a single longest (correct) chain will
rapidly emerge. The original Bitcoin paper [90] models a
malicious miner trying to reverse a transaction by “trying
to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain.”
as a binomial random walk and shows that the attacker will
eventually lose the “race” with the rest of the network. Miller
and LaViola [84] and Garay et al. [46] provide more detailed
formal proofs that if a majority of miners follow the compli-
ant strategy and communication latency is small compared to
the expected time to discover a block, miners will eventually
agree on an ever-growing preﬁx of the transaction history
regardless of the strategy of non-compliant miners. This is
sufﬁcient to ensure all stability properties except fairness
(due to potential temporary withholding), with the exact size
of the majority required depending slightly on network and
other assumptions.
With a majority miner, stability is not guaranteed.
It is well known that a single non-compliant miner which
controls a majority of computational power could undermine
fairness by collecting all of the mining rewards, simply by
ignoring blocks found by others and building their own chain
which by assumption will grow to become the longest chain.
The majority miner could separately choose to undermine
liveness by arbitrarily censoring transactions by refusing
to include them and forking if they appear in any other
block. Finally, the majority miner could undermine both
convergence and eventual consensus by introducing arbitrar-
ily long forks in the block chain, potentially to reverse and
double-spend transactions for proﬁt. All of these strategies
would result in nominal proﬁts, but since these behaviors are
detectable, they may not be in a rational miner’s long-term
interest. We will return to this point in the next section.
If miners can collude, stability is not known. Even
in the absence of a majority miner, smaller miners could
potentially collude to form a cartel controlling a majority
of mining power and emulating any strategy available to a
single majority miner. It is not known whether such a cartel
would be internally stable or whether members might be
tempted to defect or if excluded miners could break it up by
offering to form an alternate cartel on more favorable terms.

Mining pools could possibly be a technical mechanism for
cartel formation; the dynamics of miners’ choice of pools
and migration between pools have not been studied. It also
appears no rigorous analysis has been attempted of whether
and how miners might encourage others to participate in a
cartel through side-payments.
Stability is not known as mining rewards decline.
All of these results have used a simpliﬁed model in which
each block carries a constant, ﬁxed reward fee. The planned
transition of miner revenue from block rewards to transaction
fees will negate this assumption and require more complex
models which take into account the distribution of available
transaction fees. To our knowledge there has been no thor-
ough analysis of how stability will be affected either in the
end state of no mining rewards or in intermediate states as
transaction fees become a non-negligible source of revenue.
2) Stability with externally-denominated utility: Results
in the bitcoin-denominated utility model do not provide
convincing justiﬁcation of Bitcoin’s observed stability in
practice (let alone assurance of its continued stability in
the future), due to the lack of observed attacks despite the
existence of large mining pools potentially in the position
to proﬁt by non-compliant behavior. In reality, miners are
clearly not solely interested in obtaining nominal bitcoins
but in obtaining real-world proﬁts. Modeling this requires
developing a utility function for miners which incorporates
not only how many bitcoins they earn, but also how effec-
tively they can convert their bitcoins into real-world value or
other currencies. Miners’ strategies might affect their ability
to convert bitcoin-denominated wealth into real-world value
due to three related factors:
Liquidity limits. Currently, exchanges which trade Bit-
coin for external currencies typically have low liquidity.
Thus, an attacker may obtain a large number of bitcoins
but be unable to convert them all into external value, or can
only do so at a greatly reduced exchange rate.
Exchange rates in the face of attack. Some non-
compliant strategies, particularly those that would affect
stability in a visible way, might undermine public conﬁdence
and hence weaken demand for bitcoins in the short run.
Indeed, in practice the exchange rate has been found to dip
in the face of technical glitches with the system [72]. A
strategy which quickly earns many nominal bitcoins but is
likely to crash the exchange rate once discovered may thus
be difﬁcult to cash out before the exchange rate can react,
particularly given the liquidity limits mentioned above.
Long-term stake in bitcoin-denominated mining re-
wards. Most large miners have an additional interest in
maintaining Bitcoin’s exchange rate over time because they
have signiﬁcant capital tied up in non-liquid mining hard-
ware which will lose value if the exchange rate declines.
If miners expect they will maintain their share of mining
power far into the future with low marginal costs (e.g., if a
substantial portion of their operational costs are paid upfront
to buy equipment), then they may avoid strategies which
earn them more bitcoins but decrease the expected value
of their future mining rewards. Note that this is a limiting
factor even if a miner might otherwise be able to cash out
stolen bitcoins more quickly than the public can react, as
long as there is no effective market in which miners can sell
expected future mining power.
Nakamoto outlined a version of this argument [90] to
downplay the likelihood of majority-miner attacks, argu-
ing that they would permanently damage the system (and
exchange rate) and “playing by the rules” (following a
compliant strategy) would be more proﬁtable over time. In
practice, the GHash.IO mining pool exceeded 50% of the
network’s computational capacity for an extended period in
July 2014 and publicly promised to limit their capacity in the
future in order to avoid damaging conﬁdence in the system.
Unfortunately, exchange rates are difﬁcult to capture in
a tractable game-theoretic model as it inherently depends
on human judgment and market conﬁdence. Modeling the
effects of exchange rates and real-world utility functions
more formally is a signiﬁcant open problem.
3) Stability with incentives other than mining income:
At least two strategies have been analyzed which may be
advantageous for a miner whose utility is not purely derived
from mining rewards.
Goldﬁnger attacks. If a majority miner’s goal is explic-
itly to destroy Bitcoin’s stability and hence its utility as a
currency, they can easily do so. Kroll et al. [64] introduced
this model and named it a Goldﬁnger attack. For example, a
state wishing to damage Bitcoin to avoid competition with
its own currency, or an individual heavily invested in a
competing currency, may be motivated to attempt such an
attack. Arguably, these attacks have already been observed
through altcoin infanticide, in which deep-forking attacks
against new competing currencies with low mining capacity
have been successfully mounted by Bitcoin miners.15 If a
mature futures market arises in which a miner can take a
signiﬁcant short position on Bitcoin’s exchange rate, then
Goldﬁnger-style attacks may be directly proﬁtable.
Feather-forking. Miller [82] proposed the strategy of
in which a miner attempts to censor a
feather-forking,
blacklist of transactions by publicly promising that
if a
blacklisted transaction is included in the block chain, the
attacker will retaliate by ignoring the block containing the
targeted transaction and attempting to fork the block chain.
The attacker’s fork will continue until it either outraces the
main branch and wins, or falls behind by k blocks at which
point the attacker will concede publication of the targeted
transaction. An attacker with α < 50% of the mining
power will, on expectation, lose money, but will succeed in
blocking a blacklisted transaction with positive probability.
15For example, CoiledCoin was an altcoin that was destroyed by a
signiﬁcant attack from Eligius, a Bitcoin mining pool [77].

However, if the attacker can convincingly show that they
are serious about retaliatory forking, other miners will be
motivated to shun the targeted transactions as they also lose
on expectation if the attacker retaliates. Thus, an attacker
may be able to enforce their blacklist with no actual cost as
long as all other miners believe the attacker will perform a
