## Abstract
With the Internet becoming the primary channel for marketing and promotion, online advertisements are increasingly being used for illegal activities such as spreading malware, scamming, and click fraud. To understand the severity of these malicious advertising activities, which we term "malvertising," we conducted a large-scale study by analyzing web traces related to advertisements over a three-month period. Our findings reveal that hundreds of top-ranking websites have fallen victim to malvertising, and leading ad networks like DoubleClick have been infiltrated.

To mitigate this threat, we identified prominent features from malicious advertising nodes and their associated content delivery paths, and leveraged these to develop a new detection system called MadTracer. MadTracer automatically generates detection rules and uses them to inspect advertisement delivery processes and identify malvertising activities. Our evaluation shows that MadTracer detected 15 times more malvertising cases than Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront combined, with a low false positive rate. Additionally, it uncovered new types of attacks, including a previously unreported form of click-fraud attack.

## 1. Introduction
Visiting any commercial website today, you are likely to encounter banner advertisements (ads). Online advertising has grown into a multi-billion-dollar industry, offering convenience and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional media. However, this ease of use also makes it an attractive tool for hackers and con artists to conduct malicious and fraudulent activities. We broadly refer to these ad-related malicious activities as malvertising, which can occur at any point in the ad-delivery chain, including publishers, ad networks, and advertisers.

### Anti-malvertising Efforts
Both industry and academia have been working on addressing this threat, typically through inspecting ads for malicious content. However, malicious ads often use obfuscation and code packing techniques to evade detection. The complexity is further increased by the pervasiveness of ad syndication, where ad networks resell ad spaces to other networks and advertisers. This model increases the likelihood of posting malicious content on reputable websites, as it allows malicious ad networks to deliver ads directly to users without going through more reputable channels.

Despite years of effort, anti-malvertising remains challenging. Little is known about the infrastructure used to deliver malicious ad content. Key questions include: how do attackers get onto ad networks? What roles do malicious nodes play in a malvertising campaign? How do they hide their activities from detection? An in-depth understanding of these issues can help identify the weakest links in the malvertising infrastructure and present new angles for detection using information that characterizes not just individual entities but their roles and interactions.

### Our New Findings
In this paper, we report an extensive study of the malvertising infrastructure based on a crawl of 90,000 leading websites over a three-month period. Using the collected web traffic traces, we performed a fine-grained analysis of malvertising cases reported by Google Safe Browsing and Microsoft Forefront. Our key discoveries include:

- **Malvertising Scale**: Malvertising affects top websites and infiltrates leading ad networks like DoubleClick.
- **Evading Strategies**: Different cloaking techniques are deployed across malvertising nodes to evade detection.
- **Properties of Malicious Parties**: Malicious parties exhibit distinctive features, including their ad-related roles, domain and URL properties, URL popularity and lifetimes, and pairing relations. These features, when viewed collectively, offer a good characterization of malvertising activities.
- **Ad Delivery Topology**: Malvertising paths typically involve multiple malicious domains that are closely connected. This observation reveals the topological connections among malicious parties in the ad context, which can be leveraged to characterize their malicious behaviors.

### New Techniques
The dynamic interactions among malvertising entities and their distinctive features present unique opportunities for detection. We model ad-delivery topologies using short path segments that describe the redirection relations among domains. This approach, combined with node features, effectively captures suspicious cases and is robust to code obfuscation. It is fundamentally difficult for attackers to alter the features and interconnect relations of multiple ad entities, especially when some are controlled by legitimate domains.

Based on this representation, we designed and implemented MadTracer, the first infrastructure-based malvertising detection system. Using a machine learning framework, MadTracer automatically generates detection rules on three-node path segments annotated with node attributes. When applied to our crawled data from June to October 2011, MadTracer detected 9,568 malvertising redirection chains, each involving a unique domain sequence. Compared to the combined detection of Safe Browsing and Forefront, our system increased coverage by 15 times. Over 95% of the detected malvertising cases were confirmed either through collaboration with Microsoft Forefront or manual validation. In addition to drive-by downloads and fake-AV scams, our system also discovered a new type of click-fraud attack, where attackers compromise websites and hijack user traffic into fraudulent ad clicks.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Online Advertising
Our research focuses on display ads, which are loaded automatically to a web page without requiring user interaction. Display ads are extremely popular, appearing on most highly-ranked websites. Here, we describe the key actors and the ad delivery process.

#### Actors in Web Advertising
- **Publishers**: Display ads on their web pages on behalf of advertisers, earning revenue through pay-per-impression or pay-per-click models.
- **Advertisers**: Create ads and provide the revenue source for online advertising. Ad networks act as intermediaries, bringing together publishers and advertisers.
- **Audiences (Users)**: Visit publisher pages and receive ad contents, potentially clicking on ads to be redirected to advertiser websites.

Additional parties, such as trackers, gather delivery statistics important for performance measurement.

#### Ad Delivery Process
Figure 1 illustrates the ad delivery process:
- **Direct Delivery**: Publishers embed ad tags (HTML or JavaScript code) on their pages. When a user visits, the tags generate a request to an ad network for ad contents, which are then displayed.
- **Ad Syndication**: Ad networks resell ad spaces to other networks. The browser receives code from the syndicator, which fetches ad tags from third-party ad networks, providing ad contents directly or further outsourcing the spaces.

### 2.2 How Malvertising Works: An Example
Online advertising has been extensively used by miscreants for malicious activities. To illustrate, we describe a real malicious ad campaign discovered in June 2011 and later confirmed by BlueCoat Security Lab in July 2011.

This was a fake Anti-Virus (AV) campaign that infected 65 publisher pages from June 21st to August 19th, 2011, including the homepage of freeonlinegames.com, an Alexa top 2404 website. The page’s ad tag first queried Google and DoubleClick, which referred visitors to a third-party ad network, adsloader.com. This ad network turned out to be malicious, delivering an ad tag that redirected the user's browser to a fake AV site, attempting to trick the visitor into downloading a malware executable.

What made this campaign interesting was its inclusion of DoubleClick, a popular ad exchange network. The attackers set up a third-party ad network, adsloader.com, to syndicate with DoubleClick. When accessed by a victim, adsloader.com displayed an image and injected a hidden iframe pointing to enginedelivery.com, which redirected users to eafive.com (a fake AV site). The HTML code of eafive.com was classified by Forefront as TrojanDownloader:HTML/Renos.

All involved malicious parties performed cloaking to evade detection. For example, adsloader.com never redirected the same IP address twice and only did so if the user agent was IE. It also checked the referrer field and did not inject the iframe if it was empty. The redirector enginedelivery.com did not send malicious content to requests from certain IP ranges, and the fake-AV site eafive.com attacked only IE-6 users. The attackers recruited over 24 ad networks, 16 redirectors, and 84 fake-AV scanners, rotating them throughout the campaign. Only 4 redirectors and 11 fake-AV sites were caught by Google Safe Browsing; none of the malicious ad networks were blocked.

### 2.3 Attacks Leveraging Malvertising
We consider the following categories of attacks that leverage the ad-delivery infrastructure:

- **Drive-by Download**: Exploits browser or plugin vulnerabilities using dynamic content in JavaScript or Flash.
- **Scam and Phishing**: Includes fake AVs and other attempts to trick users into disclosing sensitive information.
- **Click-Fraud**: Attackers set up malicious publisher sites and redirect user traffic (e.g., via hidden iframes) to advertiser pages without user awareness, generating fraudulent clicks.

In all these attacks, attackers store malicious content on their own or compromised sites and promote these sites through blackhat SEO techniques, spam campaigns, or by exploiting ad networks.

## 3. Dataset and Terminology
Our research focuses on the ad infrastructure, which links multiple ad-related parties during an ad delivery process. By infrastructure, we refer to the collective set of entities, their roles in web advertising, and their interactions and relationships. Our goal is to identify distinguishing infrastructure-related characteristics and leverage them for developing detection techniques. To this end, we crawled popular web pages, which we call publisher pages, to measure and analyze ad-redirection chains.
