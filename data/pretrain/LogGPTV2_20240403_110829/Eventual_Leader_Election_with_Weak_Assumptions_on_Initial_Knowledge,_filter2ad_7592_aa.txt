Abstract
This paper considers the eventual leader election prob-
lem in asynchronous message-passing systems where an ar-
bitrary number t of processes can crash (t  t. Moreover, there are protocols that build Ω
in crash-prone asynchronous distributed systems equipped
with a failure detector of the class 3S [5, 6, 17]. A stack-
ing of the previous protocols provides a protocol building Ω
in an asynchronous system equipped with 3St+1 (this is a
“reduction” of Ω to 3St+1).
The reduction approach can be used to investigate, com-
pare, and rank the computability power of failure detector
classes. One of its most important results is the fact that the
classes Ω and 3S are equivalent: given a failure detector of
any of these classes, it is possible to build a failure detector
of the other class [5, 6, 17].
Content of the paper: Weak reliability and synchrony
assumptions All the previous protocols implicitly as-
sume that each process initially knows the identity of each
other process.
It is shown in [11] that this assumption
is a necessary requirement for the classes Ω and 3S to
be equivalent. Actually, 3S (as deﬁned in [4]) cannot
be built in a system where the initial knowledge of each
process is limited to its own identity (if a process crashes
