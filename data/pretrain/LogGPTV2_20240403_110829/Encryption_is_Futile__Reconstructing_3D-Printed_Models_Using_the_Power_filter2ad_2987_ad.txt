### 4.6 Point Cloud Generation

Upon completion of the heuristic search and correction process, the trace contains valid timestamped peaks on the X-, Y-, Z-, and E-axes, all properly tagged wherever a reversal occurs. Although the firing order is now fully correct, there may still be discrepancies between the listed peaks and the real behavior of the printer. In the final stage, we implemented a state machine to track the position and behavior of the print head and translate its motions into a point cloud, with each entry being an (X, Y, Z) tuple.

The state machine is initialized with a starting position of (0, 0, 0) and then iterates through the peaks in timestamp order. Processing a peak updates the position of the printhead based on the axis and movement direction of the peak. The E-axis is tracked to determine whether a new position is part of an extruding or non-extruding move. Dwell annotations on the E-axis peaks mark the beginning and end of periods of extrusion. If the E-axis is inactive, the position is updated but not saved to the point cloud.

After processing all peaks, the output from the state machine is the full point cloud representation of the print. By default, the point cloud is in units of discrete motor steps; we convert these to millimeters for easier comparison with the original models. We used per-axis steps to millimeter ratios of: 6:1 for X, 6:1 for Y, and 95.2:1 for Z. The E-axis is used only to track extrusion and non-extrusion and does not need to be converted. The point cloud can be exported as a .XYZ file, a common format for point clouds and meshes, and can be manipulated by external modeling programs.

### 5. Experimental Evaluation

For our experiment, we selected a range of models that vary in size and geometric complexity. The simplest model is a cube, 10mm on each side, which prints entirely in linear movements (G0 or G1 G-code commands). The remaining models contain both linear and non-linear movements such as arcs and splines (G2, G3, and G5 G-code commands) and complex surfaces. The models are rendered in Figure 14.

These models were sliced using Cura Lulzbot Edition 3.6.20 for printing on our Lulzbot Taz 6. The slicer settings were consistent across all models, with an infill parameter of 20% at a 45-degree rotation and the default behavior of thicker base layers and full infill for top and bottom layers. This ensures that we are reconstructing realistic sliced and printed models rather than handmade or simplified print patterns.

The reconstruction process runtime varied between 15 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the model size. Given the threat model, this runtime is not considered restrictive.

The results of our process are summarized in Table 2. Simpler and shorter models, such as the Cube and Ninja Star, were reconstructed perfectly, while more complex models, such as the Stanford Bunny, exhibited visible misalignments across layers. Most models were only moderately distorted and remained recognizable. A human engineer could correct the errors and achieve the quality of the simple objects.

Quantifying these errors and determining their meaningfulness presented a novel challenge not adequately addressed in the literature. Chhetri et al. [11], who first demonstrated an acoustic side-channel attack on AM systems, quantified their reconstruction using average percentage of axis recognition and average movement distance error. They achieved 78.35% accurate axis recognition and 17.82% movement distance error for their test prints, which were zero-infill perimeter polygons.

Using similar distance-oriented metrics, we achieved 100% axis recognition (because all individual motors were instrumented). Across our tested models, we calculated the total distance error as `bad_section_steps/total_steps`. This produced a maximum error of 1.7% for the Rook model and a minimum of 0.07% for the Wrench. On average, the error was 0.79%. This figure represents an upper bound of error, as not every step within a bad section is incorrect.

Gao et al. [17] evaluated their reconstruction of the infill path using a metric derived from the Hausdorff Distance. Their approach locates the point in the reconstructed path that is most distant from any point in the original path and reports that distance as an upper bound on error. However, we believe that all approaches to date for measuring accuracy have limited use in the context of AM reconstruction. This topic is explored further in Section 7.1.

### 6. Fundamental Limitations

While our approach achieved significantly higher accuracy on more complex models than prior reconstruction attempts, it still contains uncorrected errors. Some of these errors can be corrected, while others are fundamental to the approach. The most fundamental limitations are discussed below.

The most interesting limitation arises from the disconnect between the toolpath motions and the true shape of the printed part. When the printhead is positioned, the nozzle is placed slightly above the extrusion position to leave room for filament to extrude and attach without collisions. The extruded filament also has a diameter that changes shape while it solidifies. During printing motions, the elasticity of the molten filament means that it will continue to extrude after the extruder motor stops moving. When planning a toolpath, the slicer attempts to account for these and other physical characteristics of the material and printing system. Many of these compensation techniques are adjusted by the user, vary according to printer and settings, and are largely opaque to our side-channel analysis. Producing a mesh directly from the reconstructed point cloud will produce a smaller mesh than the original due to these offsets and will contain small gaps due to flow-rate manipulation.

Another key limitation is that the approach cannot distinguish between body and supporting printed material. Many objects must be printed with support material to allow for large overhangs and prevent print defects such as sagging or non-adhesion. Given the variation in support structure design and use, recognizing it automatically based on geometric characteristics would be a difficult proposition.

These key limitations are based on the characteristics of the 3D printer, filament, and options available in the slicer. Further study will undoubtedly uncover more limitations and the means to overcome them. The techniques necessary to evaluate and compensate for these are beyond the scope of the present work.

### 7. Further Discussion

#### 7.1 Measuring Error in Reconstruction

From a security perspective, the key benefit of disclosing this attack is to enable realistic risk analysis. For infringement, an attacker needs an accurate enough reconstruction method. As defenders, we must therefore assess the quality of the attack from this perspective. However, there are several fundamental issues in assessing reconstructions of printed models.

The point cloud generated by our method not only describes the exterior surface of the object but also describes the interior points corresponding to infill, internal voids, support structures, and other features. Established methods for comparing similar paths, such as the Hausdorff Distance [21], can be adapted by restricting their application to individual layers (as in Gao et al. [17]), but even then, questions remain.

Most importantly, it is difficult to ascertain if any existing metrics correspond meaningfully to the printability of an object. For example, one step of drift in our system corresponds to 0.16mm. This may seem like an inconsequential amount of drift, but it could be enough to completely collapse a support structure, which is often only one step wide. Drift on a support structure, even in this smallest possible increment, could lead to a failed print. If it occurs elsewhere, it may not even be visible to the naked eye. Figure 16 demonstrates this difference: the degree of drift in the Octopus print is consistently 1-4 steps, which is barely noticeable in the main body but would cause a print failure in the fine details. The impact of error on printability, therefore, is not necessarily proportional to simple measures like distance.

New metrics must be developed for assessing the quality of reconstructions in AM. The preceding discussion implies that these metrics may only be meaningful for specific AM technologies. Solving these and eventually further to-be-identified challenges requires dedicated investigations that are outside the scope of this paper.

#### 7.2 Implications for Risk Management

The presented reconstruction attack poses a threat to outsourced FDM printing processes that circumvents encryption-based DRM technology. But what risk does this pose for a business relying on an AM service provider using FDM printing? A business facing such a risk must decide on a response: in-house their printing operations, deploy technical and policy strategies, or accept the risk and proceed without a mitigation strategy.

To support this decision process, organizations might turn to NIST’s guidance in the Cybersecurity Framework [1]. While this framework is voluntary in U.S. industry, its use is mandated within the U.S. government itself [23]. The Framework is hierarchical, with five high-level risk management functions at the top, categories of security outcomes in the middle, and over 100 distinct outcome subcategories at the bottom. Each subcategory includes informative references to existing standards and best practices. Figure 15 provides a top-level view of the Framework’s structure, with relevant categories and subcategories. Below, we provide specific examples where the threat of attack developed in this paper could be accounted for within the cybersecurity Framework.

A straightforward subcategory to apply is Data Security (PR.DS-5), stating that protections against data leaks should be implemented. Side-channel theft of design data would represent a substantial data leak, and appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate this risk.
