User: I am trying to run a Python program from inside another Python program using these commands:

subprocess.call(self.runcmd, shell=True);
subprocess.Popen(self.runcmd, shell=True); and
self.runcmd = " python /home/john/createRecordSet.py /home/john/sampleFeature.dish " 

Now the script runs fine but the file its supposed to write to is not even getting created, i'm using "w" mode for creating and writing
Assistant: The absolute path of Python in self.runcmd should do the magic!
Try using the absolute path of file name while opening the file in write mode.
