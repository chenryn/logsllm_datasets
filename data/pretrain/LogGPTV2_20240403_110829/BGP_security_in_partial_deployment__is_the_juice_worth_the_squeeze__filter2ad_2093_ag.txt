tamper / eavesdrop / drop) traﬃc from as many source ASes
as possible. (We deal with the fact that ASes can source dif-
ferent amounts of traﬃc [31] in Sections 4.5, 5.2.2, 5.3.1.)
Attacker’s strategy. The attacker m wants to convince
ASes to route to m, instead of the legitimate destination
AS d that is authorized to originate the preﬁx under attack.
It will do this by sending bogus AS-path information using
legacy BGP. What AS path information should m propa-
gate? A straightforward extension of the results in [22] to
our models shows it is NP-hard for m to determine a bogus
route to export to each neighbor that maximizes the number
of source ASes it attracts. As such, we consider the arguably
simplest, yet very disruptive [7, 22], attack: the attacker,
which is not actually a neighbor of the destination d, pre-
tends to be directly connected to d. Since there is no need to
explicitly include IP preﬁxes in our models, this translates to
a single attacker AS m announcing the bogus AS-level path
“m, d” using legacy BGP to all
its neighbor ASes. Since
the path is announced via legacy BGP, recipient ASes will
not validate it with S*BGP, and thus will not learn that it
is bogus. (This attack is equally eﬀective against partially-
deployed soBGP, S-BGP and BGPSEC. With soBGP, the
attacker claims to have an edge to d that does not exist in
the graph. With S-BGP or BGPSEC the attacker claims to
have learned a path “m, d” that d never announced.)
3.2 Are secure ASes subject to attacks?
Ideally, we would like a secure AS with a secure route to
be protected from a routing attack. Unfortunately, however,
this is not always the case. We now discuss a troubling
aspect of S*BGP in partial deployment [27]:
Protocol downgrade attack.
In a protocol downgrade
attack, a source AS that uses a secure route to the legit-
imate destination under normal conditions, downgrades to
an insecure bogus route during an attack.
The best way to explain this is via an example:
Figure 2. We show how AS 21740, a webhosting company,
suﬀers a protocol downgrade attack, in the security 2nd (or
3rd) model. Under normal conditions (left), AS 21740 has a
secure provider route directly to the destination Level 3 AS
3356, a Tier 1 ISP. (AS 21740 does not have a peer route via
AS 174 due to Ex.) During the attack (right), m announces
that it is directly connected to Level3, and so AS 21740 sees
a bogus, insecure 4-hop peer route, via his peer AS 174.
Importantly, AS 21740 has no idea that this route is bogus;
it looks just like any other route that might be announced
with legacy BGP. In the security 2nd (and 3rd) model, AS
21740 prefers an insecure peer route over a secure provider
route, and will therefore downgrade to the bogus route.
In Section 5.3.1, we show that protocol-downgrade attacks
can be a serious problem, rendering even large partial de-
ployments of S*BGP ineﬀective against attacks.
Downgrades are avoided in the security 1st model.
Protocol downgrade attacks can happen in the security 2nd
and 3rd models, but not when security is 1st:
Theorem 3.1. In the security 1st model, for every at-
tacker AS m, destination AS d, and AS s that, in normal
conditions, has a secure route to d that does not go through
m, s will use a secure route to d even during m’s attack.
The proof is in Appendix F. While the theorem holds only
if the attacker m is not on AS s’s route, this is not a severe
restriction because, otherwise, m would attract traﬃc from
s to d even without attacking.

INVARIANTS TO DEPLOYMENT
Given the vast number of possible conﬁgurations for a
partial deployment of S*BGP, we present a framework for
exploring the security beneﬁts of S*BGP vis-a-vis origin au-
thentication, without making any assumptions about which
ASes are secure. To do this, we show how to quantify secu-
rity (Section 4.1), discuss how to determine an upper bound
on security available with any S*BGP deployment for any
routing model (Section 4.3.1), ﬁnally compare it to the secu-
rity available with origin authentication (Section 4.2, 4.4).
4.1 Quantifying security: A metric.
We quantify improvements in “security” by determining
the fraction of ASes that avoid attacks (per Section 3.1).
The attacker’s goal is to attract traﬃc from as many ASes as
possible; our metric therefore measures the average fraction
of ASes that do not choose a route to the attacker.
Metric. Suppose the ASes in set S are secure and consider
an attacker m that attacks a destination d. Let H(m, d, S)
be the number of “happy” source ASes that choose a legiti-
mate route to d instead of a bogus route to m. (See Table 2).
