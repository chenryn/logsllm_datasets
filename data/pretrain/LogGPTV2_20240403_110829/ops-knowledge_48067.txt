User: I have created a small python application to be used internally in my organization. I wrote the code on my primary development machine running Fedora 17 and I would like to create a .deb in order to make it easy for my colleagues to install my program.
Is it possible to create debian packages for python application from a system running fedora? If yes, how?
Assistant: Create an rpm package, give it to your Debian users and tell them to convert the rpm to a Debian package using alien on their Debian box.
