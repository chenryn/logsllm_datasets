Let us make several comments on the conditions of this
result. First note that Assumption 3 is not necessary in this
theorem. Also notice that in a single-hop path (i.e., N = 1),
the theorem can be proved without the stationary departure
approximation. However, in the multi-hop cases, the ap-
proximation is needed even when cross-trafﬁc routing is
one-hop persistent. The reason is that when n is large, the
probing packet-train is also viewed as a ﬂow, whose arrival
characteristics at all but the ﬁrst hop are addressed by the
stationary departure approximation.
Theorem 5 shows that when the packet-train length n
increases while keeping s constant, not only E[GN ] con-
verges to its ﬂuid bound γN , but also the variance of GN
decays to 0. This means that we can expect almost the same
output dispersion in different probings.
4.3 Discussion
Among the assumptions in this paper, some are critical in
leading to our results while others are only meant to sim-
plify discussion. We point out that the distributional sta-
tionarity assumption on cross-trafﬁc arrivals can be greatly
relaxed without harming our major results. However, this
comes at the expense of much more intricate derivations.
This is because when cross-trafﬁc arrivals are allowed to
be only second-order stationary or even non-stationary,
the output dispersion process {GN (m)} will no longer be
identically distributed. Consequently, the analysis of prob-
ing response curves cannot be reduced to the investigation
of a single output dispersion random variable. Moreover,
we also have to rely on an ASTA assumption on packet-
train probing [9] to derive the results in this paper, which
we have avoided in the present setting.
Also note that the inter-ﬂow independence assumption
is made to maintain the distributional stationarity of cross-
trafﬁc arrivals at a ﬂow aggregation level. It only helps us

avoid unnecessary mathematical rigor and is insigniﬁcant
in supporting our major conclusions.
On the other hand, the mean-square ergodicity plays a
central role in the (omitted) proofs for Theorem 4 and The-
orem 5. A cross-trafﬁc ﬂow with mean-square ergodicity,
when observed in a large timescale, has an almost constant
arrival rate. This “asymptotically ﬂuid like” property, is
very common among the vast majority of trafﬁc models in
stochastic literature, and can be decoupled from any type of
trafﬁc stationarity. Consequently, our results have a broad
applicability in practice.
Next, we provide experimental evidence for our theo-
retical results using testbed experiments and real Internet
measurement data.
5 Experimental Veriﬁcation
In this section, we measure the response curves in both test-
bed and real Internet environments. The results not only
provide experimental evidence to our theory, but also give
quantitative ideas of the curve deviation given in (26). To
obtain the statistical mean of the probing output disper-
sions, we rely on direct measurements using a number of
probing samples. Even though this approach can hardly
produce a smooth response curve, the bright side is that
it allows us to observe the output dispersion variance, re-
ﬂected by the degree of smoothness of the measured re-
sponse curve.
5.1 Testbed Experiments
In our ﬁrst experiment, we measure in the Emulab testbed
[1] the response curves of a three-hop path with the follow-
ing conﬁguration matrix (all in mb/s) and one-hop persis-
tent cross-trafﬁc routing

We generate cross-trafﬁc using three NLANR [2] traces.
All inter-packet delays in each trace are scaled by a com-
mon factor so that the average rate during the trace duration
becomes the desired value. The trace durations after scal-
ing are 1-2 minutes. We measure the average output disper-
sions at 100 input rates, from 1mb/s to 100mb/s with 1mb/s
increasing step. For each input rate, we use 500 packet-
trains with packet size 1500 bytes. The packet train length
n is 65. The inter-probing delay is controlled by a random
variable with sufﬁciently large mean. The whole experi-
ment lasts for about 73 minutes. All three trafﬁc traces are
replayed at random starting points once the previous round
is ﬁnished. By recycling the same traces in this fashion, we
make the cross-trafﬁc last until the experiment ends without
creating periodicity. Also note that the packet-trains are in-
jected with their input rates so arranged that the 500 trains

for each input rate is evenly separated during the whole
testing period.
This experiment not only allows us to measure the re-
sponse curve for n = 65, but also for any packet-train
length k such that 2 ≤ k < n = 65, by simply taking
the dispersions of the ﬁrst k packets in each train. Fig. 2(a)
shows the rate response curve ˜Z(rI , s, n) for k = 2, 9, 33
and 65 respectively. For comparison purposes, we also plot
in the ﬁgure the multi-hop ﬂuid curve ˜F(rI ), computed
from Theorem 1, and the single-hop ﬂuid curve ˜S(rI ) of
the tight link L3. The rate response curves ˜Z(rI , s, n) is
deﬁned as follows
˜Z(rI , s, n) =
rI
s/E[GN (s/rI , s, n)]

First note that the multi-hop ﬂuid rate curve comprises
four linear segments separated by turning points 36mb/s,
56mb/s, and 76mb/s. The last two linear segments have
very close slopes and they are not easily distinguishable
from each other in the ﬁgure. We also clearly see that the
rate curve asymptotically approaches its ﬂuid lower bound
as packet-train length n increases. The curves for n = 33
and n = 65 almost coincide with the ﬂuid bound. Also
note that the smoothness of the measurement curve reﬂects
the variance of the output dispersion random variables. As
the packet train length increases, the measured curve be-
comes smoother, indicating the fact that the variance of the
output dispersions is decaying. These observations are all
in agreement with those stated in Theorem 5.
Unlike single-hop response curves, which have no devi-
ation from the ﬂuid bound when the input rate rI is greater
than the link capacity, multi-hop response curves usually
deviate from its ﬂuid counterpart in the entire input range.
As we see from Fig. 2(a), even when the input rate is larger
than 96mb/s, the measured curves still appear above ˜F.
Also observe that the single-hop ﬂuid curve ˜S of the tight
link L3 coincides with the multi-hop ﬂuid curve ˜F within
the input rate range (0, 56) but falls below ˜F in the input
rate range (56, ∞).
Finally, we explain why we choose the link capacities to
182

be 96mb/s instead of the fast ethernet capacity 100mb/s. In
fact, we did set the link capacity to be 100mb/s. However,
we noticed that the measured curves can not get arbitrarily
close to their ﬂuid bound ˜F computed based on the fast eth-
ernet capacity. Using pathload to examine the true capacity
of each Emulab link, we found that their IP layer capaci-
ties are in fact 96mb/s, not the same as their nominal value
100mb/s.
In our second experiment, we change the cross-trafﬁc
routing to path-persistent while keeping the path conﬁgu-
ration matrix the same as given by (31). Therefore, the
ﬂow rate vector now becomes (20, 20, 20).
We repeat the same packet-train probing experiment and
the results are plotted in Fig. 2(b). The multi-hop ﬂuid
rate curve ˜F still coincides with ˜S in the input rate range
(0, 56). When input rate is larger than 56mb/s, the curve
˜F positively deviates from ˜S. However, the amount of
deviation is smaller than that in one-hop persistent rout-
ing. The measured curve approaches the ﬂuid lower bound
˜F with decaying variance as packet-train length increases.
For n = 33 and n = 65, the measured curves become
hardly distinguishable from ˜F.
We have conducted experiments using paths with more
hops, with more complicated cross-trafﬁc routing patterns,
and with various path conﬁgurations. Furthermore, we ex-
amined the impact of probing packet size using ns2 simu-
lations, where the packet size can be set to any large val-
ues. Results obtained (not shown for brevity) all support
our theory very well.
5.2 Real Internet Measurements
We conducted packet-train probing experiments on several
Internet paths in the RON testbed to verify our analysis in
real networks. Since neither the path conﬁguration nor the
cross-trafﬁc routing information is available for these Inter-
net paths, we are unable to provide the ﬂuid bounds. There-
fore, we verify our theory by observing the convergence of
the measured curves to a piece-wise linear curve as packet-
train length increases.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we measure the rate response
curve of the path from the RON node lulea in Sweden to
the RON node at CMU. The path has 19 hops and a fast-
ethernet minimum capacity, as we ﬁnd out using traceroute
and pathrate. We probe the path at 29 different input rates,
from 10mb/s to 150mb/s with a 5mb/s increasing step. For
each input rate, we use 200 packet-trains of 33 packets
each to estimate the output probing rate s/E[GN ]. The
whole experiment takes about 24 minutes. Again, the 200
packet-trains for each of the 29 input rates are so arranged
that they are approximately evenly separated during the 24-
minute testing period. The measured rate response curves
associated with packet-train length 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, and 33
are plotted in Fig. 3(a), where we see that the response

curve approaches a piece-wise linear bound as packet-train
length increases. At the same time, response curves mea-
sured using long trains are smoother than those measured
using short trains, indicating the decaying variance of out-
put dispersions.
In this experiment, the curve measured
using probing trains of 33-packet length exhibits sufﬁcient
smoothness and clear piece-wise linearity. We have ob-
served two linear segments from the ﬁgure. A further in-
vestigation shows that the ﬂuid bound of this 19-hop path
only has two linear segments.
Based on (15), we apply linear regression on the second
linear segment to compute the capacity Cb and the cross-
trafﬁc intensity λb of the tight link and get Cb = 96mb/s
and λb = 2mb/s. Using these results, we retroactively
plot the single-hop ﬂuid bounds and observe that it almost
overlaps with the measured curve using packet-trains of 33-
packet length. Notice that the bottleneck link is under very
light utilization during our 24-minute measurement period.
We can also infer based on our measurement that the avail-
able bandwidth of the path is constrained mainly by the
capacity of the bottleneck link and that the probing packet-
trains have undergone signiﬁcant interaction with cross-
trafﬁc at non-bottleneck links. Otherwise, according to
Theorem 3 in [9], the response curves measured using short
train lengths would not have appeared above the single-hop
ﬂuid bound when the input rate is larger than the tight link
capacity 96mb/s. We believe that the tight link of the path
is one of the last-mile lightly utilized fast-ethernet links and
that the backbone links are transmitting signiﬁcant amount
