User: I want to install python2.5.5 in Ubuntu10.10, since Ubuntu10.10 now just supports python>=2.6, so I download source file from python website and try to install it use 
./configure && make && sudo make install, it seems that python2.5.5 has been installed successfully, but when I want to use it, sometimes it says "no module named ...", but it should be bundled, I have used it in my Win7, so I wonder whether I can install all the libs.
Assistant: You probably missing some libraries that are not bundled by default on Ubuntu with Python (I have no idea why they decided to split "core" python this way).
You can try running apt-get build-dep python python-dev and build again (you might need to add other packages as well).
Rule of thumb is that if Python complains about not having sqlite3 module, you need to install libsqlite3-dev, then rebuild.
