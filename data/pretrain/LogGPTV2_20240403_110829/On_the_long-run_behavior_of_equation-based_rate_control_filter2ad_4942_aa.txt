ABSTRACT
We consider unicast equation-based rate control, where a source
estimates the loss event ratio p, and, primarily at loss events, ad-
justs its send rate to f (p). Function f is assumed to represent the
loss-throughput relation that TCP would experience. When no loss
occurs, the rate may also be increased according to some additional
mechanism. We assume that the loss event interval estimator is
non-biased. If the loss process is deterministic, the control is TCP-
friendly in the long-run, i.e, the average throughput does not ex-
ceed that of TCP. If, in contrast, losses are random, it is a priori not
clear whether this holds, due to the non-linearity of f, and a phe-
nomenon similar to Feller’s paradox. Our goal is to identify the key
factors that drive whether, and how far, the control is TCP friendly
(in the long run). As TCP and our source may experience different
loss event intervals, we distinguish between TCP-friendliness and
conservativeness (throughput does not exceed f (p)). We give a
representation of the long term throughput, and derive that conser-
vativeness is primarily inﬂuenced by various convexity properties
of f, the variability of loss events, and the correlation structure of
the loss process.
In many cases, these factors lead to conserva-
tiveness, but we show reasonable experiments where the control is
clearly non-conservative. However, our analysis also suggests that
our source should experience a higher loss event ratio than TCP,
which would make non-TCP friendliness less likely. Our ﬁndings
provide guidelines that help understand when an equation base con-
trol is indeed TCP-friendly in the long-run, and in some cases, ex-
cessively so. The effects of round trip time and its variations are
not included in this study.

INTRODUCTION
We consider an adaptive source that employs unicast equation-
based rate control: the source estimates the loss event ratio p, and,
primarily at loss events, adjusts its send rate to f (p). Function f is
assumed to represent the loss-throughput relation that TCP would
experience. When no loss occurs, the rate may also be increased ac-
cording to some additional mechanism, as we deﬁne below. An ex-
ample of such an equation-based rate control is TFRC [10], which
we use most of the time in this paper as a recurring example. Be-
cause f is assumed to represent TCP’s loss throughput equation, it
is expected that such a rate control is TCP friendly, i.e., our adaptive
source shares the network fairly with competing TCP sources [11].
More precisely, this is required to happen on two time scales: in the
short-run, response to congestion should be commensurate to that
of TCP; in the long-run, average throughput should not exceed that
of TCP. In this paper, we focus on the latter (we call it “long-run
TCP-friendly”); we refer to [11, 7, 8] for some deﬁnitions regard-
ing the concept of TCP-friendliness. Our goal is to identify the
key factors that drive whether, and how far, the equation-based rate
control is long-run TCP friendly.
We ﬁrst point out that TCP and our source may experience dif-
ferent loss event ratios, and thus distinguish between TCP-friendly
and conservative control. We say that the equation-based rate con-
trol is conservative, or undershoots, when ¯xA ≤ f (¯pA), where
¯xA is the long-run time average of the send rate ( = throughput) of
our adaptive source and ¯pA its average loss event ratio. Note that
we require a careful deﬁnition of loss rate, to avoid bias. Follow-
ing [10] we assume that our source employs an unbiased estimator
of the loss event interval, which is the amount of data sent in the
interval between two successive loss events (see assumption (E) in
Section 2). If there is convergence, then at the limit we would have
¯xA = f (¯pA). In practice, though, the control is required to be re-
sponsive, and thus the non-linearity of function f leaves little hope
that ¯xA = f (¯pA). In fact, we do show in Section 3.4 that there
are cases where the control undershoots, and others where it over-
shoots. Undershooting may appear to be a non-problem, however,
we show in this paper that there are structural elements that lead to
systematic, and sometimes excessive undershoot. In contrast, we
ﬁnd that overshooting may occur, but that there are fundamental
reasons that limit its impact. Further, our analysis also shows that it
is not only the non-linearity of f that plays a role, but also another
phenomenon related to Feller’s paradox1.
Our ﬁndings are applied to the following choices of functions
f (see also Section 2.4): the square root formula [12] (we call it
SQRT); the loss-throughput formula (we call it PFTK-standard),
1Feller’s paradox [6] is that the average interval seen by a random
observer is larger than the average interval sampled by an observer
at interval boundaries.
103and a slight variant (we call it PFTK-simpliﬁed). Other formulae
exist that differ by a constant [3, 18]; our analysis applies directly to
those as well. Yet other formulae are for short-lived TCP ﬂows [5];
we did not include them in our analysis, since we focus on long-run
behavior. Note however that most of our ﬁndings are independent
of the speciﬁc function f being used.
We further distinguish between basic control, which consists in
updating the send rate at every loss event, and comprehensive con-
trol, which adds a rate increase mechanism during intervals where
no loss occurs. The comprehensive control reﬂects what is imple-
mented in TFRC. We perform a detailed, exact analysis of the basic
control. We ﬁnd an approximate representation of comprehensive
control and use it together with simulations. We ﬁnd, numerically
and by simulation, that the comprehensive control adds only a mod-
est increase in long-run throughput to the basic control (remember
that we focus here on long-run analysis; clearly, the comprehensive
control may have a larger impact in the short-run).
For the basic control, we ﬁnd fairly exhaustive results. First, con-
servativeness is strongly inﬂuenced by the convex or concave na-
ture of two functionals of f, and the joint statistics of the loss event
interval θn. If (C1) the statistics are such that θn and the loss event
interval estimator ˆθn are lightly or negatively correlated (there are
indications [20] that loss event intervals may be lightly correlated),
then the control is conservative. Further, the higher the variabil-
ity of the loss event estimator, the more conservative the control
is; similarly, the higher the loss event ratio, the more conservative
the control. Both of these effects are more pronounced with PFTK
than with SQRT; with PFTK, this causes the control to be exces-
sively conservative in regions of heavy loss. SQRT does not have
this problem (but is also a less accurate representation of TCP’s
behavior). This conservative nature of TFRC control has been em-
pirically observed in [9, 19, 2]. Second, if the correlation condi-
tion (C1) does not hold, then results may be radically different, and
strongly depend on the nature of function f. We identiﬁed one
useful case where we can conclude about non-conservativeness. If
(C2c) the correlation of the duration between loss events and the
send rate is non-negative, then for PFTK and heavy loss, the con-
trol systematically overshoots. For PFTK with low to medium loss,
or for SQRT in all cases, this does not occur. This is due to con-
vexity properties of some functionals of f, which holds differently
in these cases. An example of protocol to which these assumptions
may apply is an audio source with a constant packet rate, which
adapts its data rate by varying the packet size [4]. These ﬁndings
are exact for the basic control; for the comprehensive control, we
pose them as claims and verify them by numerical and ns experi-
ments.
To complete the analysis, we address two additional points. First,
we compare, analytically and by simulation, the loss event ratio
experienced by our adaptive source (¯pA) and by TCP (¯pT ). We
ﬁnd that ¯pT ≤ ¯pA should be expected in most cases; this drives
our source to have a smaller long-run throughput than TCP, be-
yond and above the effects mentioned above. Second, it remains
to be seen whether the TCP equation used in a system is an accu-
rate representation of TCP; we do not have an in-depth evaluation
of this point; instead, we point to [3] for a discussion of this is-
sue. However, we do ﬁnd indications that there may be signiﬁcant
differences. This shows that designers of TCP-friendly protocols
should clearly separate, in their evaluation, the three elements of
conservativeness, TCP loss event ratio versus this protocol’s loss
ratio, and TCP’s obedience to its formula. Failing to do so blurs
the setting of parameters and may lead to undesired corrections. In
contrast, knowing the expected deviations given in this paper leads
to a safer understanding and tuning. Our results are based on an-
alytical ﬁndings (backed up by simulations) and should thus apply
to a wide class of situations, including dynamic environments.
Limitations. We have identiﬁed some fundamental factors of
equation-based rate control, by a mathematical analysis and ex-
periments. Once the factors are identiﬁed, it remains to be seen
what their values are in the real Internet. While existing measure-
ments already provide some indication [20], this remains for further
work. Also, throughout the paper, we assume that the round trip
time (RTT) experienced by our source is constant, and known. It is
outside the scope of this paper to address the impact on the control
of variations of the RTT (the same method can be used). Last, we
focus on the relationship between loss event ratio and throughput,
taking both as observed quantities; stability and convergence are
not addressed in this paper.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our as-
sumptions and notations. Section 3 gives our analytical ﬁndings.
They are derived for the basic control, then veriﬁed numerically
and by simulation of the control. We summarize our main ﬁndings
in the form of two claims, given in Section 3.3. In Section 4 we val-
idate our ﬁndings with ns simulations. In Section 5 we address the
two additional points of TCP loss event ratio versus this protocol’s
loss event ratio, and TCP’s obedience to its formula. All proofs are
given in the appendix.

TATIONS
2.1 Notation
We consider an adaptive source with the send rate at time t equal
to X(t). We assume that X(t) can be described by an ergodic
process, and thus equate the long-run average with the expected
value: ¯x = E[X(0)]. Index n refers to the n-th loss event. We
use the following additional notation. Tn, is the time at which the
n-th loss event is detected by the source. Sn = Tn+1 − Tn is the
elapsed time between two successive loss events. Xn = X(Tn) is
the rate set at the n-th loss event. (θn)n is the number of packets
sent between two successive loss events (θn packets in [Tn, Tn+1)).
Following TFRC, we call θn the loss event interval.
T we denote expectation with respect to the Palm proba-
bility P0
T , which is, roughly speaking, the probability given there is
a loss event at time 0 (see for instance [1] for a formal deﬁnition).
Let

dicate that the convexity condition (F1) in Theorem 1 would
be satisﬁed in all three cases, but this is strictly true only for
SQRT and PFTK-simpliﬁed; it also illustrates that convexity is
much more pronounced for PFTK-simpliﬁed than for SQRT.
The bottom ﬁgure illustrates that the concavity condition (F2)
of Theorem 2 is true for SQRT; for PFTK-standard and PFTK-
simpliﬁed it holds only for small loss event ratios; for heavy loss
(x small), the curves are convex and thus the opposite condition
(F2c) holds.

2.3 Comprehensive Control
Here we add an additional mechanism to the basic control in (3),
and call the resulting system the comprehensive control. The mech-
anism reﬂects a response to positive feedback as found in TFRC
[10].
Let θ(t) be the number of packets sent since the most recent loss
event that was observed before t. Then we deﬁne the comprehen-
sive control as follows, for t ∈ [Tn, Tn+1),

In other words, at time t, the loss event interval estimator ˆθ(t) is
updated with θ(t), if that increases the value of the estimator. If this
is not the case, then ˆθ(t) is kept to ˆθn. Note that once the condition
At is true (θ(t) sufﬁciently large), the control (4) responds to the
positive feedback by increasing the send rate.
Notice that the send rate dynamics is such that, if ˆθn+1 ≤ ˆθn,
then X(t) = f (1/ˆθn) for all t ∈ [Tn, Tn+1). Else, for ˆθn+1 > ˆθn
the send rate is X(t) = f (1/ˆθn), for t ∈ [Tn, Un], and then the
rate increases according to (4) for t ∈ (Un, Tn+1). Here, from the

2.4 Functions f Used in This Paper
We use the following loss throughput formulae. We ﬁrst consider
perhaps the simplest one, “the square-root”, which we call SQRT
[12]:
f (p) =

p
(5)
where c1 is some constant, and r the average round-trip time.
We refer to another well-known function f (Eq. (30) in [13]) as
PFTK-standard:
f (p) =
√
c1r

p + q min[1, c2
√
p](p + 32p3) ,

for some constant c2; here q is TCP retransmit timeout. A variant
of the above formula is referred to in TFRC speciﬁcation [10]). We
call it PFTK-simpliﬁed.

SERVATIVE OR NOT
We ﬁrst give the core mathematical expressions that are used to
compute, in theory and in numerical experiments, the throughput
of our control.
