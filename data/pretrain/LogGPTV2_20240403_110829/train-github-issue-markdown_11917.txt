While upgrading to 0.18.1 a new process killer popped up. I had three
processes to kill: Alienware Command Center, nVidia Overlay and Microsoft
Store. Having to manually kill these processes is a bit of a pain, especially
when one, nVidia Overlay, is not killable.
In that popup, add an option for the installation process to kill those
processes like Ccleaner does when the Cookies Options tab is accessed.
