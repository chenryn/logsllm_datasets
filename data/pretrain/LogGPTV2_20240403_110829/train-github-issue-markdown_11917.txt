During the upgrade to version 0.18.1, a new process killer prompt appeared, requiring me to terminate three specific processes: Alienware Command Center, NVIDIA Overlay, and Microsoft Store. Manually killing these processes is inconvenient, particularly since one of them, NVIDIA Overlay, cannot be terminated easily.

To improve this experience, I suggest adding an option within the installation process that automatically terminates these processes, similar to how CCleaner handles the termination of processes when accessing the Cookies Options tab.

Here is a screenshot for reference:
