User: I'm running Python 3.2 on Win XP. I run a python script thru a batch file via this:
C:\Python32\python.exe test.py %1
%1 is an argument that i pass to do some processing in the python script. 
I have 2 variables in the batch file that I also want to send as arguments to the python script.
set $1=hey_hi_hello
set $2=hey_hi
I want to be able to do something like this if possible:
C:\Python32\python.exe test.py %1 $1 $2
And then retrieve these argiments in the python script via sys.argv[2] and sys.argv[3]
Would appreciate any help with this. Thank you.
Assistant: Another option is to write arguments right after the python script, following the example:
python your_script.py this that
If you are using Linux .sh file, remember to run dos2unix XXX.sh before you run:
bash XXX.sh.
The reason, in a simple version, is that dos and unix use different newline breakers.
