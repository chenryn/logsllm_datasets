Hi,
It's not clear to me what 2D/3D corner case I've found myself in between
Scipy, pyinstaller, and GH actions, but since it seemed related to other
issues (#14002), I wanted to report, feel free to close if best reported in
one of those other tools instead.
As part of the CellProfiler build process on GH actions we pip install SciPy
(just from PyPI, nothing fancy) as part of the process of installing
CellProfiler then use pyinstaller to package in our dependencies via the
linked spec . When we tested a release we put together yesterday, we found
that on Windows but not Mac pyinstaller was unable to find the OpenBLAS dll,
leading to a bunch of messages ala the below
    2022-12-15T13:28:48.4432784Z 112298 WARNING: lib not found: libopenblas-57db09cfe174768fb409a6bb5a530d4c.dll dependency of c:\hostedtoolcache\windows\python\3.8.10\x64\lib\site-packages\scipy\sparse\linalg\_isolve\_iterative.cp38-win_amd64.pyd

The application was built, but then failed on launch due to scipy.libs not
being able to be found.
We had last built in August with 1.9.0, so after trying other stuff we tried
pinning to that, and the build succeeded - I didn't test 1.9.1 or .2 . Is it
expected that the location or packaging of that dll would be different in
1.9.0 vs 1.9.3 ? I did try a bunch of things (to be fair, my PyInstaller
skills are poor hahaha) to try to get it to find the dll, but none succeded.
Thanks in advance for any help you can give - happy to upload build logs or
anything else you think may help.
