## 190814 (AzSK v.4.0.0)
### Feature updates
*	(Preview) Restructuring of DevOps Kit framework for reusability:
	*	From the learnings of developing DevOps Kit-based AAD & ADO scanners, we have done an extensive refactoring exercise to make it easy to leverage core framework capabilities to create security/compliance scanners for other technology areas.
*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM):
	*	The following new switches have been added to PIM cmdlets:
	*	-ListSoonToExpireAssignments switch in Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration cmdlet to list eligible assignments that will expire within specified duration.
	*	-ExtendExpiringAssignments switch in Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration cmdlet to extend the eligibility of assignments by a specified duration.
*	(Preview) Credential Hygiene:
	*	Credential hygiene events generated via control scan will now be send to DevOps Kit configured log analytics workspace.
	*	We have also introduced New-AzSKTrackedCredentialGroup cmdlet to configure email alerts to notify users about AzSK-tracked credentials that are about to expire or have already expired.
*	(Preview) Approved exception support in control attestation:
	*	The control attestation feature has been augmented to support a special “GRC-approved” exception for controls. This covers scenarios where controls cannot be passed due to limitations/conditions beyond the realm of application teams (e.g., a product bug). It can be triggered by using the new -AddException switch during attestation.
*	Security Verification Tests (SVTs):
	*   Support for severity-based filter for Get-AzSKControlsStatus (GACS) command.
*	ARM Template Checker:
	*	N/A
*	CICD:
	*	Support for a switch to toggle whether to ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ the pipeline if no controls are scanned via SVT and 	    ARM Checker task (default is ‘fail’).
	*	This flag is useful in situations where due to scan criteria (e.g., -Severity ‘Critical’) no controls might be      scanned when the task runs.
*	(Preview) In-cluster security scans for ADB, AKS, HDI Spark
	*	In-cluster CA now supports sending scan telemetry to log analytics (LA) workspace. This can be configured by 	    using the Install-AzSKContinuousAssuranceForCluster cmdlet. (If no LA workspace is specified, the workspace         configured for the regular DevOps Kit CA in the subscription will be used.)
	*	The DevOps Kit monitoring solution (Install-AzSKMonitoringSolution) views will now show in-cluster compliance       status for your HDInsight and Databricks workspaces.
*	Log Analytics:
	*	N/A
*	Org-policy updates (for non-CSEO users):
	*	Fixed an issue in Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus cmdlet where in local debugging mode, extension files            weren't getting loaded.
	*	Fixed an issue in Get-AzSKOrganizationPolicyStatus cmdlet checks which were failing after fresh installation of     org-policy.
	*	Improved messages in the org-policy cmdlets (Install, Get & Update- org policy).
	*	Introduced DisableOrgPolicyCheckForSession flag in Set-AzSKPolicySettings cmdlet to disable enforcement of          org-policy for the current PS session. This helps in situations when an org-policy owner is working with            multiple side-by-side policies.
Note: The next few items mention features from recent releases retained for visibility in case you missed those release announcements:
*	Privileged Identity Management (PIM) helper cmdlets (from last sprint)  
	*	Set-AzSKPIMConfiguration for configuring/changing PIM settings
	*	Get-AzSKPIMConfiguration for querying various PIM settings/status
	*	Activating your PIM role is now as simple as this:
		pim -ActivateMyRole -SubscriptionId $s5 -DurationInHours 8 -Justification 'ad hoc test' -RoleName Owner
	*	See docs [here](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit-docs/blob/master/01-Subscription-Security/Readme.md#azsk-privileged-identity-management-pim-helper-cmdlets-1) for more.
*	(Preview) Security Scan for Azure Active Directory (AAD)
	*	You can scan security controls for your AAD tenant (as either an admin or even as a regular user) using the DevOps Kit AAD Security Scan module.
	*	Use following steps:
		 AAD scan cmdlets are packaged as a separate module (AzSK.AAD)
		```Powershell
		Install-module AzSK.AAD -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber
		Import-module AzSK.AAD
		Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusTenant    # to check the tenant (admin)
		Get-AzSKAADSecurityStatusUser      # to check objects you own (user) 
		```
	*	Caveats: 
		*	Do not run these in the same PS session as AzSK. Start a new PS console.
		*	Az- modules require .Net Framework v4.7.2.
		*	By default, the current cmdlets will scan just 3 objects of each type (Apps/SPNs/Groups, etc.). This is until we work out how best to group/batch scans when scanning the entire tenant. If you want to scan more objects you can use the ‘-MaxObj’ switch in the cmdlets.
*	(Preview) AzSK module for Azure DevOps (VSTS) 
	*	You can try the scan cmdlet using:
  		#VSTS scan cmdlet is in a separate module called AzSK.AzureDevOps!
  		Install-Module AzSK.AzureDevOps -Scope CurrentUser -AllowClobber    
  		Get-AzSKAzureDevOpsSecurityStatus -OrganizationName "MicrosoftIT"`
                                    -ProjectNames "OneITVSO"`
                                    -BuildNames "build_name_here"`
                                    -ReleaseNames "release_name_here"  
.
*	Org-policy updates (for non-CSEO users):
	*	See CA section in “Other improvements/bug fixes” below to install CA in environments where subscription ownership resides with a different team. 
### Other improvements/bug fixes
*	Subscription Security:
	*	N/A
*	SVTs: 
	*	N/A
*	Controls:
	*	The behavior for the controls ‘Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_Persistent_Access_RG, 	                        Azure_Subscription_AuthZ_Dont_Grant_Persistent_Access’ has been enhanced to check persistent access of users        and groups on resource group and subscription scope respectively.
	*	VM control ‘Azure_VirtualMachine_SI_Enable_Antimalware’ has been improved by adding Sophos antivirus check for      Linux VMs.
	*	Added a new control ‘Azure_VirtualMachine_SI_Deploy_Required_Extension’ which can be used by organizations to       specify which VM extensions are mandatory across the org. Different sets of extensions can be specified for         Windows and Linux VMs.
