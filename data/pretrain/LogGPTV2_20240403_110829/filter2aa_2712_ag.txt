If Windows NT 4.x clients can’t print to the server, make sure that the queue name is 
not the TCP/IP address of the printer or server. Use the DNS host name instead of the 
printer or server address or, if there is none, enter a queue name containing only letters 
and numbers.The name of an SMB print queue must not exceed 15 characters. 
General Problems With Print Services
For additional problems and possible solutions, see the chapter on solving problems in 
the print service administration guide.
• Print service doesn’t start
• Clients can’t add queue
• Jobs in a server queue don’t print
• Print queue becomes unavailable

Active Directory  The directory service of Microsoft Windows 2000 and 2003 servers.
administrator  A user with server or directory domain administration privileges. 
Administrators are always members of the predefined “admin” group. 
AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)  A client/server protocol used by Apple file service on 
Macintosh-compatible computers to share files and network services. AFP uses TCP/IP 
and other protocols to communicate between computers on a network.
authentication  The process of proving a user’s identity, typically by validating a user 
name and password. Usually authentication occurs before an authorization process 
determines the user’s level of access to a resource. For example, file service authorizes 
full access to folders and files that an authenticated user owns.
authorization  The process by which a service determines whether it should grant a 
user access to a resource and how much access the service should allow the user to 
have. Usually authorization occurs after an authentication process proves the user’s 
identity. For example, file service authorizes full access to folders and files that an 
authenticated user owns.
BSD (Berkeley System Distribution)  A version of UNIX on which Mac OS X software 
is based.
code page  Defines extensions to the character set for Microsoft Windows. The base 
character set, defined by the American Standard Code for Information Interchange 
(ASCII), maps letters of the Latin alphabet, numerals, punctuation, and control 
characters to the numbers 0 through 127. The code page maps additional characters, 
such as accented letters for a particular language and symbols, to the numbers 128 
through 255.
computer account  A list of computers that have the same preference settings and are 
available to the same users and groups.

Glossary    
directory domain  A specialized database that stores authoritative information about 
users and network resources; the information is needed by system software and 
applications. The database is optimized to handle many requests for information and to 
find and retrieve information quickly. Also called a directory node or simply a directory.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)  A protocol that allows computers to transfer files over a 
network. FTP clients using any operating system that supports FTP can connect to a file 
server and download files, depending on their access privileges. Most Internet browsers 
and a number of freeware applications can be used to access an FTP server.
group  A collection of users who have similar needs. Groups simplify the administration 
of shared resources.
guest user  A user who can log in to your server without a user name or password. 
home directory  A folder for a user’s personal use. Mac OS X also uses the home 
directory, for example, to store system preferences and managed user settings for 
Mac OS X users.
IP (Internet Protocol)  Also known as IPv4. A method used with Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP) to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet. 
IP delivers packets of data, while TCP keeps track of data packets.
IP address  A unique numeric address that identifies a computer on the Internet. 
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)  A standard client-server protocol for 
accessing a directory domain.
local domain  A directory domain that can be accessed only by the computer on which 
it resides.
Mac OS X  The latest version of the Apple operating system. Mac OS X combines the 
reliability of UNIX with the ease of use of Macintosh. 
Mac OS X Server  An industrial-strength server platform that supports Mac, Windows, 
UNIX, and Linux clients out of the box and provides a suite of scalable workgroup and 
network services plus advanced remote management tools. 
NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)  A program that allows applications on 
different computers to communicate within a local area network.
NetInfo  One of the Apple protocols for accessing a directory domain.
Open Directory  The Apple directory services architecture, which can access 
authoritative information about users and network resources from directory domains 
that use LDAP, NetInfo, or Active Directory protocols; BSD configuration files; and 
network services.

open source  A term for the cooperative development of software by the Internet 
community. The basic principle is to involve as many people as possible in writing and 
debugging code by publishing the source code and encouraging the formation of a 
large community of developers who will submit modifications and enhancements. 
Network File System (NFS)  A client/server protocol that uses TCP/IP to allow remote 
users to access files as though they were local. NFS exports shared volumes to 
computers according to IP address, rather than user name and password.
print queue  An orderly waiting area where print jobs wait until a printer is available. 
The print service in Mac OS X Server uses print queues on the server to facilitate 
management.
privileges  Settings that define the kind of access users have to shared items. You can 
assign four types of privileges to a share point, folder, or file:  read/write, read-only, 
write-only, and none (no access).
protocol  A set of rules that determines how data is sent back and forth between two 
applications. 
share point  A folder, hard disk (or hard disk partition), or CD that is accessible over the 
network. A share point is the point of access at the top level of a group of shared items. 
Share points can be shared using AFP, Windows SMB, NFS (an “export”), or FTP protocols.
SMB (Server Message Block)  A protocol that allows client computers to access files 
and network services. It can be used over TCP/IP, the Internet, and other network 
protocols. Windows services use SMB to provide access to servers, printers, and other 
network resources.
subnet  A grouping on the same network of client computers that are organized by 
location (different floors of a building, for example) or by usage (all eighth-grade 
students, for example). The use of subnets simplifies administration.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)  A method used along with the Internet Protocol 
(IP) to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP 
takes care of handling the actual delivery of the data, and TCP takes care of keeping 
track of the individual units of data (called packets) into which a message is divided for 
efficient routing through the Internet. 
WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)  A name resolution service used by 
Windows computers to match client names with IP addresses. A WINS server can be 
located on the local network or externally on the Internet.
workgroup  A set of users for whom you define preferences and privileges as a group. 
Any preferences you define for a group are stored in the group account.
