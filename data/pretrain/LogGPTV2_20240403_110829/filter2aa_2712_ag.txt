### Troubleshooting Printing Issues with Windows NT 4.x Clients

If Windows NT 4.x clients are unable to print to the server, ensure that the queue name is not the TCP/IP address of the printer or server. Instead, use the DNS host name. If a DNS host name is not available, enter a queue name containing only letters and numbers. The name of an SMB print queue must not exceed 15 characters.

### General Print Service Problems

For additional problems and possible solutions, refer to the chapter on solving issues in the print service administration guide. Common problems include:

- **Print service does not start**
- **Clients cannot add a queue**
- **Jobs in the server queue do not print**
- **Print queue becomes unavailable**

### Glossary

#### Active Directory
The directory service for Microsoft Windows 2000 and 2003 servers.

#### Administrator
A user with server or directory domain administration privileges. Administrators are always members of the predefined "admin" group.

#### AFP (Apple Filing Protocol)
A client/server protocol used by Apple file services on Macintosh-compatible computers to share files and network services. AFP uses TCP/IP and other protocols to communicate between computers on a network.

#### Authentication
The process of verifying a user's identity, typically by validating a username and password. Authentication usually precedes authorization, which determines the user’s level of access to a resource. For example, file service authorizes full access to folders and files owned by an authenticated user.

#### Authorization
The process by which a service determines whether to grant a user access to a resource and the extent of that access. Authorization follows authentication. For instance, file service authorizes full access to folders and files owned by an authenticated user.

#### BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
A version of UNIX on which Mac OS X software is based.

#### Code Page
Defines extensions to the character set for Microsoft Windows. The base character set, defined by ASCII, maps letters of the Latin alphabet, numerals, punctuation, and control characters to the numbers 0 through 127. The code page maps additional characters, such as accented letters for specific languages and symbols, to the numbers 128 through 255.

#### Computer Account
A list of computers with the same preference settings and available to the same users and groups.

#### Directory Domain
A specialized database that stores authoritative information about users and network resources. This database is optimized for handling many requests and quickly retrieving information. Also known as a directory node or simply a directory.

#### FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
A protocol that allows computers to transfer files over a network. FTP clients can connect to a file server and download files based on their access privileges. Most internet browsers and freeware applications can access an FTP server.

#### Group
A collection of users with similar needs, simplifying the administration of shared resources.

#### Guest User
A user who can log in to the server without a username or password.

#### Home Directory
A folder for a user’s personal use. Mac OS X also uses the home directory to store system preferences and managed user settings for Mac OS X users.

#### IP (Internet Protocol)
Also known as IPv4, it is a method used with TCP to send data between computers over a local network or the Internet. IP delivers packets of data, while TCP keeps track of these packets.

#### IP Address
A unique numeric address that identifies a computer on the Internet.

#### LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
A standard client-server protocol for accessing a directory domain.

#### Local Domain
A directory domain accessible only by the computer on which it resides.

#### Mac OS X
The latest version of the Apple operating system, combining the reliability of UNIX with the ease of use of Macintosh.

#### Mac OS X Server
An industrial-strength server platform supporting Mac, Windows, UNIX, and Linux clients out of the box. It provides scalable workgroup and network services along with advanced remote management tools.

#### NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)
A program allowing applications on different computers to communicate within a local area network.

#### NetInfo
One of the Apple protocols for accessing a directory domain.

#### Open Directory
The Apple directory services architecture, which can access authoritative information about users and network resources from directory domains using LDAP, NetInfo, or Active Directory protocols; BSD configuration files; and network services.

#### Open Source
A term for the collaborative development of software by the internet community. The principle is to involve as many people as possible in writing and debugging code by publishing the source code and encouraging a large community of developers to submit modifications and enhancements.

#### Network File System (NFS)
A client/server protocol using TCP/IP to allow remote users to access files as though they were local. NFS exports shared volumes to computers based on IP address rather than username and password.

#### Print Queue
An orderly waiting area where print jobs wait until a printer is available. The print service in Mac OS X Server uses print queues on the server to facilitate management.

#### Privileges
Settings that define the type of access users have to shared items. Four types of privileges can be assigned: read/write, read-only, write-only, and none (no access).

#### Protocol
A set of rules determining how data is sent back and forth between two applications.

#### Share Point
A folder, hard disk (or hard disk partition), or CD accessible over the network. A share point is the top-level point of access for a group of shared items. Share points can be shared using AFP, Windows SMB, NFS (an “export”), or FTP protocols.

#### SMB (Server Message Block)
A protocol allowing client computers to access files and network services over TCP/IP, the Internet, and other network protocols. Windows services use SMB to provide access to servers, printers, and other network resources.

#### Subnet
A grouping of client computers on the same network, organized by location or usage. The use of subnets simplifies administration.

#### TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
A method used with IP to send data in the form of message units between computers over the Internet. IP handles the actual delivery of the data, while TCP keeps track of the individual units of data (packets) for efficient routing.

#### WINS (Windows Internet Naming Service)
A name resolution service used by Windows computers to match client names with IP addresses. A WINS server can be located on the local network or externally on the Internet.

#### Workgroup
A set of users for whom preferences and privileges are defined as a group. Preferences defined for a group are stored in the group account.
