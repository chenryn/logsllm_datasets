(Revenue.) From the 23 different payment instruments em-
ployed by MaxiDed, most of its revenue was received via
WebMoney payments (1,493,876 USD) followed by direct
BitCoin payments (1,324,449 USD, MaxiDed itself logged
these in USD). Around 577,118 USD was received through
the remaining payment instruments. The total amount of rev-
enue from 2011 up to May 2018, adds up to 3.4M USD.
(Operating Costs.) We have no data on personnel cost
at MaxiDed. Here, we analyze the outgoing payments to
merchants, upstreams and outstanding debts recorded in the
database.
i) Payments to Merchants. A main component of MaxiDed’s
cost structure consists of payments to merchants. Merchant
payments were exclusively deposited on WebMoney and
Epayments wallets. After MaxiDed took their 20% fee, the
remaining 80% went to the merchants. Analyzing outgoing
MaxiDed payments show 11 of the 14 operating merchants
to have received payments, adding up to 1,588,810 USD.
Figure 14 illustrates the distribu-
tion of payments made to each mer-
chant. The two largest suppliers of
server packages, mc4 and mc14, re-
ceived the bulk of the earnings. Most
of the merchants were completely
unsuccessful. The lowest earners,
combined, generated less than 190K
USD over all years.

merchants.
ii) Payments to Upstreams. We
cannot see the payments of third-party merchants to their
upstreams, only the payments where MaxiDed is itself a mer-
chant on the platform (mc0). Data shows that mc0 payments to
their upstreams add up to 1,526,015 USD, paid via WebMoney

Table 5: Statistics on ﬂagged or blocked MaxiDed customer resources
and PayPal. Note that 99% of these payments were not for
BP servers, as those were almost exclusively provided by the
third-party merchants.
iii) Debtors. The ﬁnal component of MaxiDed’s costs struc-
ture is that of outstanding debts due from its customers.
The operators have vigilantly banned customers with out-
standing debts. One customer was the exception to this
rule. Actually, this was not a real customer, but a customer
account through which MaxiDed operators themselves pur-
chased servers from merchants on their platform. These were
used to host DepFile, their large ﬁle-sharing platform side-
business. This customer entity accumulated debts amounting
to 399,123 USD.
(Proﬁts.) Table 6 details MaxiDed’s yearly ﬁnances, along-
side ﬁnances of their side business DepFile. Despite the
common understanding of BPH services being lucrative, we
clearly observe MaxiDed’s earnings to be modest and de-
clining. In total, over seven years, MaxiDed made just over
280K USD in proﬁt. If we take out the debt incurred for the
DepFile side-business (399,123 + 280,618), then the proﬁt
would have been 679,741 USD. This is still an underwhelm-
ing ﬁgure for 7 years of operating a BPH platform. Recall that
the cost of personnel, ofﬁce space, and equipment also has to
be taken from this amount. These combined costs would have
to be substantially lower than 100K USD per year to leave
even a tiny proﬁt on the balance sheet.

Table 6: Yearly ﬁnances
The side-business DepFile, on the other hand, generated
much better margins. We could even speculate that MaxiDed
was more valuable to its owners as a way to acquire cheap and
risk-free server infrastructure than as its own proﬁt model.
11 Related Work
(Underground Ecosystems.) Several ecosystems and mar-
ketplaces of a malicious nature have been studied in the lit-
erature via captured datasets. Stone-Gross et al. analyzed
credential stealing malware [29] and spam botnets [14] by
taking over part of the botnet infrastructure to understand
their inner workings. Wang et al. studied SEO campaigns to
sell counterfeit luxury goods and the effectiveness of various
interventions to combat such activities [30]. Alrwais et al.[34]
investigate illicit activities in the domain parking industry
by interacting with the services to collect ground truth data.
Christin [31] analyzed the Silk Road marketplace by running
daily crawls of its webservices for 6 months to understand
merchants, customers, and what was being sold. A followup
study by Soska and Christin [32] examined 16 anonymous
market places also by periodically crawling their webservices
and found that marketplace takedowns may be less effec-
tive than pursuing key merchants that may migrate to others.
Another followup study by Wegberg et al. [33] augments pre-
vious studies by examining evidence for commoditization of
entire cybercrime value-chains in underground marketplaces
and ﬁnds that only niche value-chain components are on offer.
Datasets on the underground can also be leaked by crimi-
nal competitors. McCoy et al. used leaked databases of three
afﬁliate programs to study pharmaceutical afﬁliate programs
[15]. More recently, Brunt et al.[35] analyzed data from a
DDoS-for-hire service and found that disrupting their reg-
ulated payment channel reduced their proﬁtability but that
they were still proﬁtable by switching to unregulated cryp-
tocurrency payments. Hao et al. [16] analyzed a combination
of leaked and legally seized data to understand the ecosys-
tem for monetizing stolen credit cards. Our dataset resulted
from the aftermath of the legal takedown of the BPH provider
MaxiDed. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no
prior academic work on BPH using such ground-truth data.
Our study uniquely provides a comprehensive picture of the
supply, demand and ﬁnances of the entire BPH operation.
(Bulletproof hosting.) Earlier efforts on detecting BPH
have relied heavily on identifying autonomous systems.
Fire [9] was one of the ﬁrst systems for detecting BP ASes by
temporally and spatially aggregating information from mul-
tiple blacklists in order to detect elevated concentrations of
persistent abuse within an AS’s IP blocks. Shue et al. [36]
noted that BP ASes often fast-ﬂux their BGP routing informa-
tion to evade detection. ASwatch [11] leveraged fast-ﬂuxing

BGP routing as strong indicator of a BP AS to build a clas-
siﬁer and detect BP ASes before they appear on blacklists.
Others have developed security metrics to compare concen-
trations of abuse on various hosting networks and to identify
negligent providers that may be suspected of operating BPH
services [37, 38], while Tajalizadehkhoob et al. developed
techniques to analyze abuse concentration on the hosting mar-
ket as a whole by identifying providers from their WHOIS
information rather than BGP data [39]. BPH however, has
evolved over time. Alrwais, et al.[5] studied a recent approach
of BPH abusing legitimate hosting providers through reseller
packages to provide a more agile BP infrastructure. Our work
complements this work by providing a unique perspective
into to the the ecosystem of BPH. Based on our analysis, we
can better reason about which mitigation techniques might
be effective and which are likely ineffective for undermining
modern agile BPH marketplaces.
12 Limitations and Future Work
In comparison to other underground marketplaces studied pre-
viously (cf. [32, 33]), MaxiDed may be seen as a specialized
marketplace for provisioning BP servers. While comparisons
with other underground markets may be drawn, direct com-
parisons are difﬁcult due to differences in how MaxiDed’s
marketplace operated. For example its customers were not
aware that merchants were involved in supplying the market-
place with resources. This also explains why in comparison
no reputation mechanisms were in place for customers to
differentiate packages based on their quality (or differentiate
good/bad merchants).
Despite such differences, we do still observe patterns simi-
lar to what other studies of criminal endeavors have reported.
For example, we have observed a concentrated supply pattern
around a handful of merchants in MaxiDed’s case, which is a
similar to what other studies of underground market places
have observed ([32, 33]). We have also observed demand to
gravitate towards the resources supplied by successful mer-
chants. The number of successful merchants being limited,
also agrees with studies of other criminal operations, e.g. in
studying spam botmasters and their operations [14].
Given that this study has focused on an in-depth analysis
of the anatomy and economics of MaxiDed, future work may
draw more systematic comparisons to better understand the
implications of what we has been reported here. Furthermore,
MaxiDed’s prominence within the ecosystem has also not
been systematically explored in our study, albeit the limited
