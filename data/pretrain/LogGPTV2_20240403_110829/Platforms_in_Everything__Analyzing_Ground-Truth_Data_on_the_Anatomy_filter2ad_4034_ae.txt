### Revenue
MaxiDed utilized 23 different payment instruments, with the majority of its revenue coming from WebMoney payments (USD 1,493,876) and direct Bitcoin payments (USD 1,324,449). The remaining payment methods contributed approximately USD 577,118. From 2011 to May 2018, the total revenue amounted to USD 3.4 million.

### Operating Costs
#### Personnel Costs
We do not have data on personnel costs at MaxiDed. Our analysis focuses on outgoing payments to merchants, upstreams, and outstanding debts recorded in the database.

#### Payments to Merchants
A significant portion of MaxiDed’s cost structure involves payments to merchants. These payments were exclusively made through WebMoney and Epayments wallets. After deducting a 20% fee, 80% of the revenue was distributed to the merchants. Out of the 14 operating merchants, 11 received payments totaling USD 1,588,810. Figure 14 illustrates the distribution of these payments. The two largest suppliers, mc4 and mc14, received the majority of the earnings, while the least successful merchants collectively generated less than USD 190,000 over all years.

| Merchant Pseudonym | Earnings (USD) |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| mc.14              | 800K            |
| mc.04              | 400K            |
| mc.10              | 600K            |
| mc.13              | 200K            |
| mc.12              | 400K            |
| mc.02              | 200K            |
| mc.11              | 200K            |
| mc.09              | 100K            |
| mc.08              | 100K            |
| mc.07              | 100K            |
| mc.01              | 100K            |

#### Payments to Upstreams
We can only observe payments where MaxiDed itself acts as a merchant (mc0). Data shows that mc0 made payments to their upstreams amounting to USD 1,526,015 via WebMoney and PayPal. Notably, 99% of these payments were not for BP servers, as they were primarily provided by third-party merchants.

#### Debtors
The final component of MaxiDed’s cost structure is the outstanding debts owed by customers. The operators strictly banned customers with unpaid debts, except for one account used by MaxiDed to purchase servers from merchants on their platform. This account, used to host DepFile, a large file-sharing platform, accumulated debts totaling USD 399,123.

### Profits
Table 6 provides a detailed breakdown of MaxiDed’s yearly finances, including those of their side business, DepFile. Despite the common perception of BPH services being highly profitable, MaxiDed’s earnings were modest and declining. Over seven years, MaxiDed made just over USD 280,000 in profit. If we exclude the debt incurred for the DepFile side-business (USD 399,123 + USD 280,618), the profit would have been USD 679,741. This figure is still relatively low for a seven-year operation, especially considering the additional costs of personnel, office space, and equipment.

### Related Work
#### Underground Ecosystems
Several studies have examined malicious ecosystems and marketplaces using captured datasets. For instance, Stone-Gross et al. analyzed credential-stealing malware and spam botnets [29, 14], while Wang et al. studied SEO campaigns for counterfeit goods [30]. Alrwais et al. investigated illicit activities in the domain parking industry [34], and Christin analyzed the Silk Road marketplace [31]. Soska and Christin [32] and Wegberg et al. [33] further explored anonymous marketplaces and cybercrime value-chains. McCoy et al. [15] and Brunt et al. [35] analyzed leaked databases and DDoS-for-hire services, respectively. Hao et al. [16] examined the ecosystem for monetizing stolen credit cards. Our dataset, resulting from the takedown of MaxiDed, provides a unique, comprehensive view of the BPH supply, demand, and financial operations.

#### Bulletproof Hosting
Previous efforts to detect BPH have focused on identifying autonomous systems. Fire [9] and ASwatch [11] developed systems to detect BP ASes, while others have developed security metrics to identify negligent providers [37, 38, 39]. Alrwais et al. [5] studied BPH abusing legitimate hosting providers. Our work complements these studies by providing a unique perspective on the BPH ecosystem, helping to better understand which mitigation techniques are effective.

### Limitations and Future Work
MaxiDed can be seen as a specialized marketplace for BP servers, making direct comparisons with other underground markets challenging. However, we observe similar patterns, such as concentrated supply and limited successful merchants, as in other criminal operations [14]. Future work could include more systematic comparisons to better understand the implications of our findings and explore MaxiDed’s prominence within the ecosystem.
