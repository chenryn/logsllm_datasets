User: How to use Ansible to automate operation and maintenance work?
Assistant: 1. Install and configure Ansible First, you need to install Ansible on the control node, and configure the required libraries and dependencies on it. 2. Configure SSH key authentication Ansible is an automation tool that needs to execute commands on remote hosts, which requires SSH key authentication to be configured. Generate a key pair on the control node and copy the public key to the managed nodes to avoid having to enter a password on every task. 3. Write Ansible playbook Ansible playbook is an ordered list of a set of tasks, which is used to define tasks such as commands and file operations to be executed by Ansible on the remote host. Need to write mission control, variables, modules, etc. 4. Call Ansible playbook Use the command line to call Ansible playbook on the control node, specify the remote host, and provide the required variables and control parameters. As policy configurations are updated and changed, timers can be used to automatically trigger Ansible playbooks to run to automate management and maintenance of required resources. 5. Monitor and update Ansible playbook Ansible playbook needs to be updated whenever there are new tasks that need to be executed on remote hosts or when libraries and dependencies change. Logs and output should be kept monitored during this time to ensure the effectiveness of Ansible automation strategies are constantly checked and adjusted. The above are common Ansible automated operation and maintenance steps, which can be configured and customized as needed.
