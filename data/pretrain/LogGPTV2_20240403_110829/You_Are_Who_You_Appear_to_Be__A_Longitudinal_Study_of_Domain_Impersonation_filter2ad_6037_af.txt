### A DOMAIN IMPERSONATION SURVEY

#### A.1 Survey Design
Section 3 discusses the results of a user survey we conducted to measure the effectiveness of different domain impersonation techniques. This appendix provides more detail about how our survey was designed and conducted.

##### Participant Recruitment
We recruited 251 participants from Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) platform. The study was advertised only to residents of the United States (and territories) who were over 18 years of age and had an MTurk HIT rate of over 95%. The HIT rate is the percentage of MTurk tasks that they completed successfully and received compensation for. The survey was conducted through Qualtrics.

##### Compensation
We expected the survey to take approximately 15 minutes. Participants were offered $2 USD for completing the survey, slightly above the US minimum wage for that amount of time. The mean time to completion was 7.69 minutes, with a standard deviation of 5.01 minutes.

##### Ethical Considerations
Our study was approved by our institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was obtained from participants before conducting the survey. The domains we selected and presented to users were similar in structure to impersonating domains observed in the wild. None of the domains hosted content at the time of the survey’s creation, but we did not own the domains, and it was conceptually possible that one of them could start hosting malicious content during the course of the study. To mitigate any harm, we presented the domains to users through images (to prevent copying and pasting them into their own URL bar) and instructed participants not to attempt to visit any of the domains described in the study.

##### Survey Construction
Participants were asked 6 questions in each of 8 categories, for a total of 48 questions. Each question presented users with a URL and an organization and asked the yes-or-no question: "Do you believe that this is the organization’s URL?"

- **Categories 1-4**: Showed domains engaged in target embedding, typosquatting, combosquatting, and utilizing Unicode homographs.
- **Category 5**: Showed the same domains as the Unicode homograph category but rendered those domains as Punycode instead of Unicode.
- **Category 6**: Showed unspoofed domains paired with their appropriate organization.
- **Category 7**: Showed unspoofed domains paired with an incorrect organization.
- **Category 8**: Showed 6 domains from the previous categories but with Google Chrome’s "not secure" warning instead of a lock icon. Our experimental design on this category was insufficient to draw conclusions, and these results are not discussed in the paper. We will be releasing our aggregate data publicly.

##### Demographic Information
After the survey, participants were given the option to provide basic demographic information. Table 9 includes information on those who participated. Our population overrepresented male, white, educated, and individuals between the ages of 18-38 compared to Census statistics from the American Community Survey [2]. Over 40% of our population reported having a technical background, which may have influenced their ability to recognize attempts at domain impersonation. Our results would be conservative in this respect.

##### Sanitization
Of the 251 participants who completed the survey, 7 provided the same answer ("Yes") to every single question. We removed the responses from these participants from our analysis.

**Table 9: Participant demographics for our user study.** In addition to the information reported above, the age range for participants was 21-70 years old, with a mean age of 35.17 and a standard deviation of 10.08. We recruited participants from 45 out of 50 states (with no participants from Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, D.C., Puerto Rico, or other US territories).

#### A.2 Survey Protocol

**Page 1: Consent Form**
Participants were presented with a consent form, affirming that they were 18 years of age or older, read and understood the consent form, and voluntarily agreed to participate in our study. If the participant answered "No" to any of the above questions, the survey would end with no further input.

**Page 2: MTurk ID Verification**
Before we begin, please verify your Amazon Mechanical Turk ID in the text field below. You can find your MTurk ID on your dashboard. Then click next. [Text field]

**Page 3: Survey Instructions**
This survey will ask your opinion about URLs. A URL is an address on the internet that is used to indicate what website someone would like to visit. For example, "http://www.facebook.com" and "https://www.google.com" are URLs for Facebook and Google, respectively. You will be shown a series of 48 questions, similar to the examples below. We ask that you simply answer with your first instinct. Afterward, we will ask you several demographic questions. We do not anticipate the survey to take more than 15 minutes. Make your judgments based only on the information presented in the question; do not attempt to visit any of the websites described in this survey, and do not enter the displayed URLs into your web browser.

You will be shown the name of an organization and a URL, as shown below:
- **Example 1**:
  - Organization: Google
  - URL: https://google.com
- **Example 2**:
  - Organization: Yahoo
  - URL: https://google.com

You will then be asked whether or not you believe this is the organization’s URL. In Example 1, "https://www.google.com" is Google’s URL, so the answer would be "yes." Since "https://www.google.com" is not the website for Yahoo’s organization, the answer to Example 2 would be "no."

When you are ready, please click the arrow to continue to the survey.

**Pages 4-51: Survey Questions**
Participants were shown each of the following organization/URL pairs on a separate page, in a random order. For each pair, participants were asked: "Do you believe that this is the organization’s URL?", and presented with "Yes" and "No" options. Note that domains in categories 1-7 were shown in a Google Chrome URL bar with a valid HTTPS lock icon, and domains in category 8 were displayed with the "Not Secure" warning Chrome displays when connecting to websites over HTTP.
