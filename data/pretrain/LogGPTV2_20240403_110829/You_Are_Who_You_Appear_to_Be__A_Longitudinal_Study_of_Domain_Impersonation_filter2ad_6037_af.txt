A.1 Survey Design
Section 3 discusses the results of a user survey we conducted to
measure the effectiveness of different domain impersonation tech-
niques. This appendix provides more detail about how our survey
was designed and conducted.
251 participants were recruited from
Participant Recruitment
Amazon’s MTurk platform. The study was only advertised to res-
idents of the United States (and territories) over 18 years of age,
with an MTurk HIT rate over 95%. An MTurker’s HIT rate is the
percentage of MTurk tasks that they completed successfully and re-
ceived compensation for. The survey itself was conducted through
Qualtrics.
Compensation We expected the survey to take approximately
15 minutes. Participants were offered $2 USD for completing the sur-
vey, slightly above the US minimum wage for that amount of time.
The mean time to completion was 7.69 minutes, with a standard
deviation of 5.01 minutes.
Ethical Considerations Our study was approved by our insti-
tution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Informed consent was
obtained from participants before conducting the survey. The do-
mains we selected and presented to users were similar in structure
to impersonating domains witnessed in the wild. None of the do-
mains hosted content at the time of the survey’s creation, however
we did not own the domains and it was conceptually possible that
one of them could start hosting malicious content during the course
of the study. To mitigate any harm in this scenario, we presented
the domains to users through an image (to prevent copying and
pasting them into their own URL bar), and instructed participants
to not attempt to visit any of the domains described in the study.
Survey Construction Participants were asked 6 questions in
each of 8 categories, for a total of 48 questions. Each question pre-
sented users with a URL and an organization, and asked the user
the yes-or-no question: “Do you believe that this is the organiza-
tion’s URL?”? The first four categories showed domains engaged
in target embedding, combosquatting, typosquatting, and utilizing
Unicode homographs. The fifth category showed the same domains
as the Unicode homograph category, but rendered those domains
as Punycode instead of Unicode. Category 6 showed unspoofed
domains paired with their appropriate organization, and category 7
showed unspoofed domains paired with an incorrect organization.
Finally, category 8 showed 6 domains from the previous categories,
but with Google Chrome’s ”not secure” warning instead of a lock
icon. Our experimental design on this category was insuﬃcient
to draw conclusions on, and these results are not discussed in the
paper. We will be releasing our aggregate data publicly.
Demographic Information After the survey, participants were
given the option to provide basic demographic information. Table 9
includes information on those who participated. Our population
overrepresented male, white, educated, and between the ages of
18-38 when compared to Census statistics from the American Com-
munity Survey [2]. Over 40% of our population reported having a
technical background. We believe that those with a technical back-
ground may be better equipped to recognize attempts at domain
impersonation Our results would be conservative in this respect.
Sanitization 251 participants completed the survey. Of those,
7 participants provided the same answer (“Yes”) to every single
question. We removed the responses from those participants from
our analysis.

Table 9: Participant demographics for our user study. In ad-
dition to the information reported above, the age rage for
participants was 21-70 years old, with a mean age of 35.17
and std. deviation of 10.08. We recruited participants from
45/50 states (with no participants from Hawaii, Montana,
North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, D.C., Puerto Rico, or
other US territories.)

that they were 18 years of age or older, read and understood the
consent form, and voluntarily agreed to participate in our study. If
the participant answered “No” to any of the above questions, the
survey would end with no further input. 〉

“http:/www.facebook.com”
This survey will ask your opinion about URLs. A URL is an ad-
dress on the internet that is used to indicate what website someone
would
and
“https://www.google.com” are URLs for Facebook and Google, re-
spectively. You will be shown a series of 48 questions, similar to
the examples below. We ask that you simply answer with your first
instinct. Afterward, we will ask you several demographic questions.
We do not anticipate the survey to take more than 15 minutes. Make
your judgements based only on the information presented in the
question; do not attempt to visit any of the websites described in
this survey, and do not enter the displayed URLs into your web
browser.
You will be shown the name of an organization, and a URL, as
shown below:
Example 1
Organization: Google
URL: https://google.com
Example 2
Organization: Yahoo
URL: https://google.com
You will then be asked whether or not you believe this is the
organization’s URL. In example 1, “https://www.google.com” is
Google’s URL, and so the answer to this question would be “yes.”
Since “https://www.google.com” is not the website for Yahoo’s
organization, the answer to example 2 would be “no.”

〈 Participants were shown each of the following organization/URL
pairs on a separate page, in a random order. For each pair, partici-
pants were asked: “Do you believe that this is the organization’s

mains in categories 1-7 were shown in a Google Chrome URL bar
with a valid HTTPs lock icon, and domains in category 8 were
displayed with the “Not Secure” warning Chrome displays when
