### Overview of DNS Coffee Data Set
The DNS Coffee data set includes zone files from April 2011 through January 2020, covering nearly nine years. Over time, as zone files for new TLDs became available, they were added to the collection. Table 1 shows the number of unique TLDs collected over time, and Figure 1 illustrates the number of distinct domains and nameservers across the zone files each year. As of September 2020, the service collects zone files for over 1250 different zones on an ongoing basis. The snapshots include zone files for legacy generic TLDs (gTLDs), such as .us, .se, and .nu, as well as new generic TLDs (ngTLDs) made available through the ICANN Centralized Zone Data Service [14].

### Challenges in Analyzing Zone Files
One challenge in analyzing zone files is that records can refer to TLDs outside of the current zone. When aggregating records from multiple zone files, cross-references across zones are automatically consolidated. However, for records referring to TLDs for which we do not collect zone files, assumptions must be made, such as assuming the resolution is valid.

### Active DNS Measurement
Certain characteristics of real-world DNS behavior cannot be learned from zone files alone. For example, zone files may list NS records for nameservers that do not have authoritative data, are not reachable, or do not exist. Active measurement data can provide additional insights into these issues, although capturing comprehensive data would require exhaustively querying all nameservers listed in the zone files for a given domain and all IP addresses for each nameserver. Open data sets like the OpenINTEL [28] project do not perform exhaustive queries; instead, they perform resolutions as a typical nameserver would, stopping when they receive an authoritative response. This approach does not capture comprehensive data on the availability or authoritativeness of nameservers listed in the zone file, particularly for partly lame delegations. To gain a more comprehensive picture, we perform our own active DNS measurements, described in Section 6.1. Given the intrusive nature and overhead of exhaustive probing, we limit the number of domains we actively probe and supplement these measurements with OpenINTEL data to assess the potential "real-world" impact of lame delegations.

### Lame Delegations Inferred from Zone Files
Our first analysis uses the nine years of zone file data to identify unresolvable nameservers that cause lame delegations. We delineate three periods of a nameserver's lifetime during which lame delegations occur, each period associated with different causes and implications. We characterize the prevalence of unresolvable nameservers and affected domains overall, how long domains are lame delegated, and how an unusual concentration in the .biz TLD reveals an undocumented registrar operational practice. We then examine unresolvable nameservers and lame delegations longitudinally over the nine years, identifying trends, prominent events that indicate causes of large-scale lame delegations, and their associated risks.

#### Methodology for Static Analysis
Our analysis of longitudinal zone file data performs "static resolution" of domains and nameservers to identify unresolvable nameservers that lead to lame delegations. Specifically, we infer lame delegations by following chains of records in zone files to establish that a nameserver has a valid resolution path. We use the zone file snapshots over time to derive the date ranges for when each nameserver has a valid resolution path. We then identify the registered domains that depend upon the nameservers during their valid time periods. Any (domain, nameserver) pair where the domain relies on a nameserver outside of that nameserver’s periods of valid resolution is a lame delegation. We refer to registered domains in the zone files simply as domains, and specifically mention in context if a domain is a fully qualified domain name.

To explain this static resolution process, we use mock NS and A records (Table 3) to show how we use four criteria to derive the "valid resolution" date ranges for the nameservers (Table 4). Each record has a start and an end date. For each TLD, we record the first time we imported the zone file for that TLD. The earliest information we have for `foo.com` and generally any domain in `.com` is 2011-04-11. We derive resolution validity if any of these four criteria hold:

1. **Other TLDs**: Domains in our set of zone files can have NS records with nameservers in TLDs for which we do not have a zone file. In Table 3, `foo.com` has a nameserver `ns1.bar.in`. Since we do not have the zone file for the `.in` TLD, we conservatively assume that `ns1.bar.in` can be resolved from 2011-04-11 to 2013-10-31 (Table 4). Of the approximately 20 million nameservers in our zone file data set, 1.4 million (7%) belong to such TLDs, and we assume they are resolvable.

2. **Late Access TLDs**: We do not always have the earliest zone file for a given TLD, e.g., our earliest copy of the `.org` TLD zone file is from 2011-06-06. If we see earlier references to nameservers in the `.org` TLD in other zone files, we conservatively mark them as resolvable for the duration before we have visibility into the TLD.

3. **Glue Records**: If a nameserver has a glue record in the zone files, we assume that the nameserver is resolvable for the duration of the glue record. In Table 3, `ns1.baz.org` and `ns1.qux.org` have glue records that make them resolvable for the durations shown in Table 4.

4. **Parent Resolution**: Domains using a nameserver that does not have a glue record can still resolve via the resolution on the nameserver’s parent domain. In Table 3, consider `ns1.thud.org`. While `ns1.thud.org` does not have a glue record, the nameserver parent `thud.org` can be resolved by `ns1.baz.org` since it has a valid resolution path via its glue records. Thus, in Table 4, we consider `ns1.thud.org` resolvable from 2011-06-06 to 2013-10-31 as a result of parent resolution. Determining parent resolution may involve multiple layers of redirection before reaching a nameserver with a valid resolution path. Otherwise, a nameserver without a glue record is unresolvable.

We illustrate this static analysis process by working through the mock examples in Tables 3 and 4. Table 4 presents the durations for which a nameserver is conservatively resolvable. Nameservers `ns1.bar.in`, `ns1.baz.org`, and `ns1.thud.org` have a valid resolution path for the entire period during which they are the nameservers of `foo.com`. However, consider `ns1.qux.org` whose glue record is valid only until 2013-09-01. Thus, we infer `ns1.qux.org` was unresolvable for the period 2013-09-02 to 2013-10-31. Additionally, `ns.1qux.org`, an example of a typo of the actual nameserver, never has any records associated with it. This typo results in a security risk since someone can register `1qux.org`, set the glue record for `ns.1qux.org` to a private nameserver, and control the resolution of `foo.com` for the fraction of requests that come its way.

Applying the static analysis across all nameservers for the full time period of our data set, we delineate a nameserver’s "unresolvability," i.e., when it is unresolvable, across three periods:

1. **Pre-Life**: The nameserver is referenced by a domain before the nameserver is first resolvable, typically due to delayed glue or delayed registration of the nameserver domain.
2. **In-Life**: The nameserver is temporarily unresolvable after previously being resolvable. The most common type of lame delegation, it is frequently the result of a nameserver domain expiring and then being renewed, or its glue records being misconfigured.
3. **Post-Life**: The nameserver is no longer resolvable or was never resolvable. Typically, it is a result of an expired nameserver domain not being renewed, or a typo when entering the nameserver domain.

We found these categories useful for identifying causes and implications of lame delegations. Our static resolution assumes that a nameserver with a glue record is routable, reachable, and operates an authoritative DNS server for the domain. Consequently, the static analysis results are lower bounds on unresolvable nameservers and lame delegations. Even so, static analysis uncovers a wide variety of DNS behavior that leads to lame delegations. Complementing this analysis, Section 6 describes our active measurements that derive a snapshot of lame delegations via operational execution of the DNS protocol.

### Prevalence of Lame Delegations
We start by characterizing the overall prevalence of unresolvable nameservers across the zone files in our data set. Table 5 shows the total number of unresolvable nameservers and the total number of domains affected. The table also includes two breakdowns of the overall numbers: by time period (columns) and by TLD (rows).

Unresolvable nameservers may be a small percentage of nameservers (4%), but they result in more than 4.11 million lame delegated domains. Most unresolvable nameservers are unresolvable in-life, which is not surprising since they correspond to issues at any point during a nameserver’s lifetime. The smallest category of unresolvable nameservers are those that are unresolvable pre-life; these cases are typically delayed registration of the nameserver domain. EPP constraints do not allow unregistered nameserver domains in the same TLD, so this situation arises only when the nameserver domain is in a different TLD from the domain itself.

### DROPTHISHOST Anomaly
We placed `.biz` at the end of Table 5 because it stands out in sharp contrast to other TLDs. The `.biz` TLD has had 381,475 nameservers across nine years of zone files. Of these, nearly half had no valid resolution path ever, yet domains still pointed to them. These results suggest an undocumented registrar operational practice that needs further investigation.
