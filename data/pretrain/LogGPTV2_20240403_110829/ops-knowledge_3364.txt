User: Searching the net this seems to be a problem caused by spaces in the Python installation path.
How do I get pip to work without having to reinstall everything in a path without spaces ?
Assistant: Here's how I solved it:

open pip.exe in 7zip and extract __main__.py to Python\Scripts folder.
In my case it was C:\Program Files (x86)\Python27\Scripts
Rename __main__.py to pip.py
Run it! python pip.py install something

EDIT:
If you want to be able to do pip install something from anywhere, do this too:

rename pip.py to pip2.py (to avoid import pip errors)
make C:\Program Files (x86)\Python27\pip.bat with the following contents:


python "C:\Program Files (x86)\Python27\Scripts\pip2.py" %1 %2 %3 %4
  %5 %6 %7 %8 %9


add C:\Program Files (x86)\Python27 to your PATH (if is not already)
Run it! pip install something
