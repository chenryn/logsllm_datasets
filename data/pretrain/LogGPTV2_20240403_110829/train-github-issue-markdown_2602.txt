Powertoys 0.13.0  
W10 version: 10. 0.18362.145
Description:  
Powertoys decides that the user has held down a modifier to invoke Fancyzone
switching and does not let up, even when nothing is being held down.
affected keys are the number row. i.e.  
1!2@3#4$5%6^7&8*9(0)
10key numberpad not affected
Steps: Unknown. Just happens after some time (hours). Might be a key
combination I'm not aware of, but trying multiple combinations doesn't seem to
trigger or undo the issue
Workaround: Restart PowerToys. Not in a long-enough session to know if it
happens again afterwards
