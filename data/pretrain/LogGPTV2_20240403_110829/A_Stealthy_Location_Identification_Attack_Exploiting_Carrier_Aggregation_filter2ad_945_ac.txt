identiﬁcation. As this example illustrates, SLIC utilizes the
absolute values of our ﬁngerprints as critical information.
4.3 Handling Unexplored Paths in SLIC
We design an extension of the aforementioned SLIC attack
when the adversary misses ﬁngerprinting some plausible paths
during the reconnaissance phase. We call such paths unex-
plored. The comparison module handles the explored paths
in the following ways. It ﬁrst computes the average DTW dis-
tance between all the labeled ﬁngerprints per path to obtain a
distance threshold. This threshold determines the average sim-
ilarity of labeled ﬁngerprints per path. We consider the victim
to be walking an unexplored path if the minimum DTW dis-
tance between the victim’s ﬁngerprint and labeled ﬁngerprints
of all paths is greater than the distance threshold (+δ). If the
victim’s path is already ﬁngerprinted, then the corresponding
path is identiﬁed as above.
5 Feasibility of SLIC in Existing LTE-A Net-
works
We ﬁrst aim to show that the SLIC is feasible in an existing
LTE-A network in a metropolitan city. By showing the attack
feasibility in a cellular network with only three CA capability,
we want to discuss the promising potential of the SLIC in
emerging cellular networks with much higher CA capability.
5.1 Experiment Setup: SLIC in LTE-A
We test the LTE-A network that supports up to three CA ca-
pability (i.e., one primary cell and up to two secondary cells)
and we use two Sony Xperia XZ1 phones for the experiments.
We run MobileInsight [27] on the phones to decode LTE-A
messages, just as the adversaries would do for their reconnais-
sance step. We have walked eight non-overlapping outdoor
paths with an average distance of 260 meters and measured
their path ﬁngerprints. We have conducted experiments for
seven days at three different times of a day (morning, after-
noon, and evening) to obtain eighteen walks per path (144
instances of walks) totaling 37 kilometers in 10 hours.
5.2 Path-Identiﬁcation Results in LTE-A
We partition our dataset into the labeled ﬁngerprints collected
during the reconnaissance phase and the victim’s ﬁngerprints
collected during the attack phase. For the labeled ﬁngerprints,
we use one Sony phone to collect data whereas for the victim’s
ﬁngerprint we use another Sony phone. We consider data
collected on the ﬁve days (i.e., twelve walks per path, a total
of 96 instances) as the labeled ﬁngerprints and in the other
two days (i.e., six walks per path, a total of 48 instances) as
the victim’s ﬁngerprint.

(b) Correlation matrix
Figure 7: Accuracy of path-identiﬁcation attack. The identiﬁ-
cation accuracy increases as the number of labeled ﬁngerprints
increases. The errorbar denotes the standard deviation.
We measure the number of conﬁgured secondary cells as
a proxy for the number of activated secondary cells due to
practical constraints in measuring activated secondary cell
at a large scale; e.g., our LTE-A providers have a per-month
total bandwidth limit for each SIM, and only a ﬁnite number
of SIMs can be purchased for academic research. In practice,
SLIC adversaries would not be bound by these constraints
because they would be able to purchase large numbers of
SIMs for the reconnaissance step. We model the number
activated secondary cells using the measured conﬁgured cells
by adding random noise to the 13% of all measured samples of
the conﬁgured cells. This is based on our observation that the
number of conﬁgured and activated secondary cells matches
by 87% in the experiment conducted over seven days (§2.2).
We randomly select a varying number of labeled ﬁnger-
prints per path ranging from 2 to 12 for all the eight paths.
We also randomly select thirty ﬁngerprints as the victim’s
ﬁngerprints. We iterate this process one hundred times for ten
random noisy data. Figure 7(a) shows the path-identiﬁcation
accuracy of SLIC with the increasing number of labeled ﬁnger-
prints per path from 2 to 12. The overall accuracy increases
from 40.7% (for two labeled ﬁngerprints per path) to 50.1%
(for twelve labeled ﬁngerprints per path).
To further investigate, we analyze the similarities between
all ﬁngerprints in all the paths in our dataset. Figure 7(b)
shows this in a correlation matrix of the eight paths. The
number in a box (i, j) represents the average of all the pairwise
DTW distance between all the ﬁngerprints in the i-th path and
the j-th path. For the majority of the paths (i.e., path indices
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), the ﬁngerprints measured for the same
path show the smallest DTW distances. For the other cases,
the average DTW distances between the ones measured for
the same paths are still close to the smallest.
5.3 Promising Potential of SLIC
While overall accuracy is far from ideal, the result in the
existing LTE-A system shows a promising potential, partic-
ularly considering that the ﬁngerprints are generated with
coarse-grained side channels (i.e., only three values in a three
CA). First, the result shows that similar ﬁngerprints are ex-
pected in two different walks on the same path. Our samples

30th USENIX Security Symposium    3905
in Figure 7 are collected across seven days in the mornings,
afternoons, and evenings, and the ﬁngerprints are quite con-
sistent in general. Second, two distinctive ﬁngerprints are
expected in general when measured on different paths.
With these promising results, we envision much higher
path-identiﬁcation accuracy with a ﬁner-grained ﬁngerprint-
ing in a cellular network with higher CA capability. In this
paper, therefore, we aim to evaluate SLIC in a near-future net-
work with densely deployed small cells. The next few sections
describe how we experiment SLIC in a near-future network.
In particular, Section 6 describes our Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation
framework where we use an existing WiFi deployment to
emulate a densely deployed cellular network.
6 Wi-Fi-to-5G Evaluation Framework
How can we test the SLIC attack in a cellular network with a
slightly more (e.g., 7–9) CA capability — a typical near-future
5G deployment scenario? To demonstrate the SLIC attacks in
such a not-fully-deployed dense small cell cellular system, we
design and implement a Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework.
Before we describe the rationale behind the design of our
framework, we brieﬂy explain why the two typical evalua-
tion approaches, namely, early-deployment/testbed sites and
computer simulations, are inappropriate.
• Early-deployment sites? As of January 2020, there are only
some cities/countries that have deployed 5G infrastruc-
ture [30]. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, none
of the real deployment (or testbeds) has dense secondary
cell deployment at a large scale yet.
• Computer simulations? With some advanced computer
simulation tools (such as ns-3 [31], OMNeT++ [32], OP-
NET [33]), one can model and simulate various physical en-
vironments (e.g., walls, moving objects) for point-to-point
wireless channel experiments. Yet, it would be extremely
costly computationally (if not infeasible) to simulate large-
scale experiments with tens of small cells and buildings
with many walking paths, which is crucial for realistic at-
tack evaluation.
6.1 Rationale Behind Using Wi-Fi for 5G
Evaluation
The high-level idea of our 5G evaluation framework is to uti-
lize an existing, densely-deployed Wi-Fi system to evaluate
the behavior/deployment of 5G secondary cells. We argue
that this seemingly unconventional idea is indeed a sound
approach to evaluating our attacks in realistic 5G environ-
ments. The rationale behind this approach is that one of the
most promising dense secondary cell technologies, License
Assisted Access (LAA) which can aggregate unlicensed spec-
trum, is speciﬁcally designed to be indistinguishable from the

existing Wi-Fi systems for the “effective and fair coexistence”
with existing Wi-Fi systems [8, 9].
Nearly identical physical and medium-access layers. We
ﬁrst illustrate how LAA is designed to be similar to the Wi-Fi
system in the physical and medium-access layers in Table 1.
First of all, the physical-layer characteristics of the two sys-
tems are nearly identical. The two systems use the same
5 GHz unlicensed frequency bands with the same maximum
transmit power of 1 Watt [8, 34] and the same OFDM sig-
nal modulation. Second, the medium-access layer of LAA is
particularly designed to behave like the Carrier Sense Multi-
ple Access/Collision Avoidance technique in the Wi-Fi stan-
dard [35]. To be speciﬁc, the LAA secondary cells follow
Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) procedure in which the cells have
to wait for the medium to be free before it can transmit on
it [36]. The two systems have the same slot time duration
and their contention windows increases exponentially (see
Section 15 in 3GPP TS 36.213 [37]). Finally, they transmit
periodic signals in a similar manner and have the maximum
transmission duration.
The indistinguishability requirement. The LAA secondary
cells operate in the same frequency as the existing Wi-Fi sys-
tems. Naturally, concerns for fair and effective coexistence
have been raised by the Wi-Fi standard community, industry,
and regulatory bodies since as early as 2015 [38, 39]. Af-
ter several years of intense discussion, the 3GPP’s solution
is to enforce strict constraints for the LAA secondary cells
and make them indistinguishable from Wi-Fi systems; that is,
from the Wi-Fi devices’ point of view, these LAA cells should
look nearly the same as another Wi-Fi system. Their design
principles are well explained in the standard document (see
Section 7 in 3GPP TR 36.889 [8]) and even explicitly used
as a performance evaluation criterion in Intel’s whitepaper on
their 4.5G systems [9]. This indistinguishable system design
and deployment lead us to believe that the future 5G LAA
secondary-cell deployment is likely to be similar to the exist-
ing Wi-Fi deployment. Hence, this constitutes the justiﬁcation
of our attack evaluation in Wi-Fi networks.
6.2 Overview of Design and Implementation
Although the idea of evaluating SLIC in Wi-Fi networks may
seem straightforward, in fact, it requires a number of non-
trivial emulations of 5G physical and medium-access layers
as well as the user behavior models to obtain the accurate

side-channel information in 5G networks.
Figure 8 depicts our Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework
from the collection of Wi-Fi received signal data to the ﬁn-
gerprint. There exist three stages. In ➊, the Wi-Fi signals are
converted to 5G signals. Then the secondary cell conﬁguration
algorithm, such as A1, A2, A4, A6 (see Section 5.5.4 in 3GPP
TS 36.331 [15]) is applied in ➋ to emulate the conﬁguration
of secondary cells for the device. We consider the above al-
gorithms because it mainly utilizes the signal strengths from
secondary cells which we emulate using Wi-Fi APs. The
dotted blue line in Figure 8 represents the total number of
secondary cells deployed at the user location. We can see that
only some of them are actually conﬁgured by the evaluation
of the secondary cell conﬁguration algorithms; see the solid
orange line. In ➌, the number of activated secondary cells
is determined based on the data usage to ﬁnally obtain the
ﬁngerprint. When a user’s demand for downlink data stream
is limited to a certain extent (e.g., watching videos with the
low-resolution setting), the cellular system would not utilize
more secondary cells than needed; see the dashed grey line
in Figure 8 for the case when a target user needs only up
to four secondary cells. We present an in-depth evaluation
in Section 8.2 regarding the effects of ﬁngerprints with the
limited downlink activities. Refer Appendix A for the details
of the three implementation steps.
6.3 Limitation in Wi-Fi-to-5G Evaluation
Framework
Our Wi-Fi-to-5G evaluation framework demonstrates realistic
emulation of SLIC in certain probable 5G deployment sce-
narios (e.g., densely deployed unlicensed small cells) but not
all possible 5G scenarios. In some 5G deployment scenarios
(e.g., millimeter waves, sub-6 GHz spectrum), one may ex-
pect different SLIC attack performance due to (1) the different
radio frequency ranges, and (2) different indoor/outdoor en-
vironments. The range of Wi-Fi APs can be shorter than the
range of some 5G cells. Hence, the activation/deactivation
of the secondary cells may happen more slowly in some 5G
deployments compared to the Wi-Fi deployment leading to a
coarser ﬁngerprint. One can also expect different ﬁngerprint
quality for outdoor deployments as they may consist of cells
with a higher range as compared to indoor deployments. All
these differences may affect the performance of the SLIC at-
tack, for example, the attacker may need to obtain a longer
victim’s ﬁngerprint to identify the path.
7 Evaluation of SLIC in Emulated 5G Net-
works
In this section, we demonstrate the performance of SLIC in our
emulated 5G network with up to nine CA capability using the
technique introduced in Section 6. We ﬁrst describe a detailed
experiment setup (§7.1) and present the main performance
evaluation of SLIC in two common attack cases (§7.2).
7.1 Experiment Setup for Large-Scale Mea-
surements
Apparatus. For the experiment with the Wi-Fi-to-5G evalua-
tion framework (§6), we develop an Android app on a smart-
phone that collects received signal strengths indicator (RSSI)
values of the Wi-Fi access points (operating in both 2.4 and
5 GHz). We also collect other auxiliary information including
Wi-Fi SSIDs and their operating frequencies. We further pre-
process the collected data by removing data from 2.4 GHz
band to emulate the unlicensed 5G secondary cell deployed
in the 5 GHz band [8].
Data collection. We invite four participants to walk on a
total of 46 different indoor paths, with an average distance of
56.4 meters. We collect the data using two Nexus 6 phones
running the aforementioned data collection app. The paths
include corridors and staircases of a large ofﬁce building with
ﬁve ﬂoors in our institution. Walking different directions on
the same path (i.e, 1 to 2 and 2 to 1) are considered as two
different paths. We ask each participant to walk 10 times
per path, yielding a total of 460 instances of walks totaling
25.9 kilometers across the paths in ﬁve hours. The walks
are distributed between different times of day (i.e., mornings,
afternoons, and evenings) across a duration of 21 days to
demonstrate SLIC’s robustness across different times.
Path synthesis for large-scale experiments. The number of
possible distinct paths in a typical multi-story ofﬁce building
may, in fact, be much higher than the number of paths we
choose to walk (i.e., forty-six). Ofﬁce buildings have several
indoor intersections, entrances, exits, and staircases and, thus,
there could exist several hundred or even a thousand different
