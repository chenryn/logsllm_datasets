### Description
Just like the author of #731, I don't want a 307 temporary redirect which is
automatically sent by uvicorn when there's a missing trailing slash in the api
call. However, the solution given in that issue, i.e. route path like "/?" no
longer works in the versions after this April as reported in in #1787, #1648
and else. Certain developers states this is an unexpected behavior and won't
be supported in the future. In this case, I'm wondering what is the current
elegant way to realize this. Or there's any way to handle both "" and "/" two
paths simultaneously?
