variability. When peers ﬁrst arrive, they quickly establish
several connections. However, since node churn is high,
they are constantly losing connections and establishing new
ones. As time passes, long-lived peers gradually accumu-
late stable connections to other long-lived peers. We further
explore this issue in Section 5 when we examine overlay
dynamics.
Node Degree For Leaves: To characterize properties of
the two-tier topology, we have examined the degree distri-
bution between the top-level overlay and leaves, and vice
versa. Figure 4(b) presents the degree distribution of con-
nections from ultrapeers to leaf peers. Distinct spikes at 30,
45 and 75 degree are visible. The ﬁrst two spikes are due to
the corresponding parameters used in LimeWire and Bear-
Share implementations, respectively. The third spike is due
to a less common implementation. This ﬁgure shows that a
signiﬁcant minority of ultrapeers are connected to less than
30 leaf peers, which indicates availability in the system to
accommodate more leaf peers.
In Figure 4(c), we present the degree of connectivity for
leaf peers. This result reveals that most leaf peers connect
to three ultrapeers or fewer (the behavior of LimeWire), a
small fraction of leaves connect to several ultrapeers, and a
few leaves (< 0.02%) connect to an extremely large num-
ber of ultrapeers (100–3000).
Implications of High Degree Peers: We observed a few
outlier peers with an unusually high degree of connectiv-
ity in all degree distributions in this subsection. The main
incentive for these peers is to reduce their mean distance
to other peers. To quantify the beneﬁt of this approach,
Figure 6(a) presents the mean distance to other peers as
a function of node degree, averaged across peers with the
same degree. We show this for both the top-level overlay
and across all peers. This ﬁgure shows that the mean path
to participating peers exponentially decreases with degree.
In other words, there are steeply diminishing returns from
increasing degree as a way of decreasing distance to other
peers.
Turning our attention to the effects of high-degree peers
on the overlay, for scoped ﬂood-based querying, the trafﬁc
these nodes must handle is proportional to their degree for
leaves and proportional to the square of their degree for ul-
trapeers. Note that high-degree ultrapeers may not be able,
or may not choose, to route all of the trafﬁc between their
neighbors. Thus, they may not actually provide as much
connectivity as they appear to, affecting the performance
of the overlay.
During our analysis, we discovered around 20 ultrapeers
(all on the same /24 subnet) with an extremely high de-
gree (between 2500 to 3500) in our snapshots. These high-
degree peers are widely visible throughout the overlay,
and thus receive a signiﬁcant portion of exchanged queries
among other peers. We directly connected to these high de-
gree peers and found they do not actually forward any traf-
ﬁc7. We removed these inactive high degree peers from our
snapshots when considering path lengths since their pres-
ence would artiﬁcially improve the apparent connectivity
of the overlay.
4.2 Reachability
The degree distribution suggests the overlay topology
might have a low diameter, given the moderately high de-
gree of most peers. To explore the distances between peers
in more detail, we examine two equally important prop-
erties of overlay topologies that express the reachability

Overlay
Figure 7: Different angles on path lengths
of queries throughout the overlay: (i) the reachability of
ﬂood-based queries, and (ii) the pairwise distance between
arbitrary pairs of peers.
Reachability of Flood-Based Query: Figure 6(b) depicts
the mean number of newly visited peers and its cumulative
value as a function of TTL, averaged across top-level peers
in a single snapshot. The shape of this ﬁgure is similar to
the result that was reported by Lv et al. (Figure 3 in [20])
which was captured in October 2000, with a signiﬁcantly
smaller number of peers (less than 5000). Both results in-
dicate that the number of newly visited peers exponentially
grows with increasing TTL up to a certain threshold and
has diminishing returns afterwards. This illustrates that the
dramatic growth of network size has been effectively bal-
anced by the introduction of ultrapeers and an increase in
node degree. Thus, while the network has changed in many
ways, the percentage (but not absolute number) of newly
reached peers per TTL has remained relatively stable. Fig-
ure 6(b) also shows the number of newly visited peers pre-
dicted by the Dynamic Querying formula (assuming a node
degree of 30), which we presented in Section 2.1. This re-
sult indicates that the formula closely predicts the number
of newly visited peers for TTL values less than 5. Beyond
5, the query has almost completely saturated the network.
Figure 6(c) shows a different angle of reachability for the
same snapshot by presenting the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF) of the number of visited peers from top-
level peers for different TTL values. This ﬁgure shows the
distribution of reachability for ﬂood-based queries among
participating peers. We use a logarithmic x-scale to mag-
nify the left part of the ﬁgure for lower TTL values. The
ﬁgure illustrates two interesting points: First, the total num-
ber of visited peers using a TTL of n is almost always an
order of magnitude higher compared to using a TTL of
(n − 1). In other words, TTL is the primary determinant
of the mean number of newly visited peers independent of
a peer’s location. Second, the distribution of newly vis-
ited peers for each TTL is not uniform among all peers.
As TTL increases, this distribution becomes more skewed
(considering the logarithmic scale for x axis). This is a di-
rect effect of node degree. More speciﬁcally, if a peer or
one of its neighbors has a very high degree, its ﬂood-based
query reaches a proportionally larger number of peers.
Pair-wise Distance: Figure 7(a) shows the distribution of
shortest-path lengths in terms of overlay hops among all
pairs of top-level peers from four snapshots. Ripeanu et
al. [23] presented a similar distribution for the shortest-
path length based on snapshots that were collected between
November 2000 and June 2001 with 30,000 peers. Com-
paring these results reveals two differences: (i) the pairwise

is signiﬁcantly more homogeneous in length, with shorter
mean value compared with a few years ago. More specif-
ically, the old snapshot shows 40% and 50% of all paths
having a length of 4 and 5 hops whereas our results show a
