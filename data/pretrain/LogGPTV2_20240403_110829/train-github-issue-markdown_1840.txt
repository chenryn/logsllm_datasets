I have a very time-sensitive application that I'm building.
I noticed that the first time a worker sends a new task, it has a non-trivial
delay due to the declaring of the queues.
I would like to know if it's possible to remove this delay, or to move it at
some init function in my worker.

## Minimally Reproducible Test Case
    import time
    from celery import Celery
    app = Celery('test', broker='redis://localhost:6379')
    @app.task()
    def dummy_task_secondary():
        print("Dummy task completed")
    @app.task()
    def dummy_task_primary():
        t = time.time()
        dummy_task_secondary.delay()
        print(f"First time it took {time.time() - t}")
        t = time.time()
        dummy_task_secondary.delay()
        print(f"Second time it took {time.time() - t}")
# Expected Behavior
There is no difference between the time it takes to send the first task and
the second.
# Actual Behavior
The first time is dramatically slower:
