# I encountered an animation error
This is the case, I exported a gltf model with animation through the 3dmax
export plugin provided by babylon.js. It plays normally in the 3d viewer that
comes with windows, and it plays normally in the online gltf viewer provided
by babylon.js, but when I use three.js, it plays incorrectly. Looks like a
matrix transformation error. I really try to fix it. I donâ€™t know if any
friends have encountered similar problems. . .
## In the three.js
