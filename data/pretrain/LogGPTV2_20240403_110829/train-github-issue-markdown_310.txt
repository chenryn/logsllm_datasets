I am currently using bootstrap as a library (not a boilerplate) for a node.js
web server. The problem is that when I do this, then it takes forever to pull
the entire repo and all history from github.
    "dependencies": {
        "bootstrap": "git+https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git#v3.0.0"
    }
I noticed that the person that owns bootstrap on npm is not tied to this repo.  
http://npmjs.org/package/bootstrap
I would be thrilled if this repo was published as an npm module so that it
could be included inside of a project without a git url pointing to npm.
Does anyone else feel this is important? If so, what are the next steps?
