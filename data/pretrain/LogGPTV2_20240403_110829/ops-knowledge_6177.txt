User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How to transfer a Database on a weekly basis for analysis purposes Just wondering what kind of processes you guys have for transferring production data offsite for analysis purposes?

I have read some of the literature but I am not sure of the overheads involved and the setup processes. 


Replication: With the production acting as both the distributor and publisher. I will employ a push system that updates my database on my analysis server weekly
SSIS: No experience but seems to be the 'standard' way?
Manual: Use windows scheduler to zip back my backup file and open up an FTP connection to my analysis server
Mirroring: No experience but used more for high availability?


FYI, I am using SQL Server 2008 with Windows Server 2008 R2. MY DB is about 36 gigs. I am only interested in the data.

Other methods welcome!

*EDIT
Additional information: 
I don't mind the database being read only and I am looking to run this process once a week.

Assistant: You could look at log shipping, very similar to your 'manual' approach but uses built-in SQL components to do the work and works with transaction log backups.

A great explanation and comparision to db mirroring can be see at http://blogs.technet.com/josebda/archive/2009/04/02/sql-server-2008-log-shipping.aspx
