I think the following should result in an error, but it passes the type
checker:
    function foo(getT: () => T, setT: (t: T) => void) { }
    function getString() {
        return 'a';
    }
    function setNum(n: number) { }
    foo(getString, setNum);
Hovering over the call to foo in VS or the Playground shows that T has been
inferred to be of type {}, but since {} isn't of type number, doesn't that
make setNum an invalid argument to be passing in?
