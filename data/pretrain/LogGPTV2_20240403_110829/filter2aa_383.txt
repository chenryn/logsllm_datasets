#### Introduction
In the trunked public safety radio system market, Motorola faces several competitors. One of the popular alternatives is the Ericsson/General Electric Enhanced Digital Access Communications System (EDACS).

#### Operational Bands and Applications
EDACS operates in VHF, UHF, 800, and 900 MHz bands, serving both private businesses and public safety organizations. Second-generation trunk-tracking scanners, such as the Bearcat 245XLT and PRO-92, along with publicly available computer software, can effectively scan these systems.

#### Channels
Each repeater site in an EDACS system has a dedicated **Control Channel** that continuously transmits signaling and command information to mobile radios. Mobile radios also use this channel to send channel requests and other messages. Listening to the Control Channel on a standard scanner results in a constant stream of digital noise.

In addition to the Control Channel, each EDACS site can have up to 23 **Working Channels**. These channels carry voice and data between mobile radios and dispatch centers.

#### System Reliability
From an operational perspective, EDACS systems offer better performance in the event of equipment failure or lost interconnections. If the central controller in a Motorola system fails or cannot communicate with a repeater, the repeater reverts to conventional mode, losing all trunking capabilities and forcing users to manually share frequencies. In contrast, EDACS enters a "failsoft" mode where trunking cards at each repeater site continue to provide basic trunking features.

#### Channel Assignment
Another key difference between Motorola and EDACS is the method of channel assignment. In Motorola systems, control messages use FCC channel numbers to specify the radio frequency, allowing listeners to enter frequencies into trunk-tracking scanners in any order. 

EDACS, however, assigns each radio frequency a **Logical Channel Number (LCN)**. These LCNs are programmed into each radio, and the control channel uses the LCN to instruct the radio to tune to the corresponding frequency. This means that listeners must enter EDACS frequencies in LCN order to track the system properly.

#### Talkgroups
EDACS talkgroups are organized into a hierarchical structure: **Agency-Fleet-Subfleet (AFS)**. Each agency has multiple fleets, and each fleet has multiple subfleets. This hierarchy is similar to a Motorola Type I system but without limitations on the number of individual radios in each subfleet.

EDACS uses 11 binary digits (bits) to identify a talkgroup, divided into three parts: one for the Agency, one for the Fleet, and one for the Subfleet. The most common arrangement for public safety agencies is four bits for the Agency, four bits for the Fleet, and three bits for the Subfleet, allowing for a maximum of 16 Agencies, 16 Fleets per Agency, and 8 Subfleets per Fleet.

| AGENCIES | FLEETS | SUBFLEETS |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 2        | 4      | 256       |
| 2        | 8      | 128       |
| 2        | 16     | 64        |
| 2        | 32     | 32        |
| 4        | 32     | 16        |
| 8        | 8      | 32        |
| 8        | 16     | 16        |
| 16       | 16     | 8         |

The AFS is usually displayed in the format AA-FFS, where AA is the Agency, FF is the Fleet, and S is the Subfleet. Newer trunk-tracking scanners that support EDACS default to displaying talkgroups in AFS format, making it easier to scan entire Agencies and/or Fleets without entering each individual talkgroup.

Some talkgroups have special functions:
- **System All-Call (00-000)**: Every radio in the system will hear a message sent to this talkgroup.
- **Agent All-Call (XX-000)**: The first talkgroup in an Agency, where the Fleet and Subfleet are both zero. For example, a transmission to talkgroup 03-000 would be heard by all radios assigned to that Agency.
- **Fleet All-Call (XX-YY0)**: The first talkgroup in each fleet. For instance, a transmission to talkgroup 04-080 would be heard by every radio in Fleet 8 of Agency 4.

One channel at each site is designated as a Control Channel. Because any channel in an EDACS system can operate as a control channel, the assignment may change. The southern site, which includes the city of Melbourne, has more frequencies due to higher activity levels. Telephone interconnect activity appears to be limited to Channel 2 frequencies.

##### Illinois State Police
The Illinois State Police in the District Chicago area operate two interconnected EDACS systems for various local, state, and federal agencies. District Chicago was formed five years ago from the old District 3 (Chicago) and District 4 (Crestwood). Several sites in Cook County and surrounding suburbs provide coverage throughout Chicagoland.

The two systems are divided into North and South, with the Eisenhower Expressway as the dividing line. Each system has ten channels.

**Logical Channel Numbers (LCNs) and Frequencies:**
| LCN  | North       | South       |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1    | 866.4625    | 866.4125    |

The Illinois State Police operates three patrols in the District: North ("Nora"), Middle ("Mary"), and South ("Sam"). Argonne National Laboratory, operated by the Department of Energy, is located about 25 miles southwest of Chicago.
