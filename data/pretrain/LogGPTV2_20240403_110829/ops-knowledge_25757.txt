User: Simply I want to clean older kernel's modules. It's "uname -r" but I need to get such information for all kernels with Python (I already know their names and can clean kernel files, initramfs and System.map). if that is possible ...
Thank you.
Assistant: Another possibility would be to try some different commands till you find one that returns sensible results. "rpm -qa kernel" should work for RedHat and some others while "dpkg --list | grep linux-image" should do the trick for ubuntu. Probably not much better than searching the filesystem directly and you have to parse the result anyhow.
