User: How can I check from inside a java program if python is installed in windows?
Python does not add its path to the system Path and no assumption is to be made about the probable path of installation(i.e it can be installed anywhere).
Assistant: this would work

Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("cmd /c
C:\Python27\python --version");
