wearable devices that have strict constraint in size and weight.
Finally, the price of the PEH we used in our prototype is
approximately 157USD (Volture V25W), while the cost of the
EEH we used is 37.5USD. Although both of the prices can be
largely reduced with a larger quantity of purchase, the cost of
building the PEH device is higher than that of the EEH device.
B. Factors Affecting Gait Recognition
Many factors exist that may impact the accuracy of a gait-
based recognition system, such as shoe, clothes, walking speed
and terrain. Previous studies have shown that the accuracy
will decrease when the test and training samples of the
person’s walking are obtained using different shoe types and
clothes [36]. Indeed, as shown in Section VI-E, the accuracy
of KEH-Gait decreases when session 1 is used for training and
session 2 is used for testing. The dataset used in the experiment
is challenging as it includes the natural gait changes over time
(two sessions separated by 1 week), as well as gait variations
due to changing in clothes, terrain and shoes. However, KEH-
Gait can still achieve the accuracy of 95% and 89% on the
two dataset respectively by the proposed MSSRC, which in
turn demonstrate the robustness of KEH-Gait to gait variations.

recognition using KEH and improve its performance. Due to
space limitation, we defer the analysis of different factors to
our future work. In fact, there has been several attempts to
study the relationship between recognition performance and
different factors [36], [37]. For example, in terms of walking
speed, Muhammad and Claudia [37] found that normal walk
has best results and fast walk is a bit better than slow walk. As
for different types of terrains, they reported that gravel walk
has better results than grass and inclined walk. We encourage
the reader to refer to [36], [38], [37] for more details.
IX. RELATED WORK
Gait Recognition: Gait recognition has been well studied
in the literature. From the way how gait is collected, gait
recognition can be categorized into three groups: vision based,
ﬂoor sensor based, and wearable sensor based. In vision based
gait recognition system, gait is captured from a remote distance
using video-camera. Then, video/image processing techniques
are employed to extract gait features for further recognition.
A large portion in the literature belong to this category [39],
[40], [41], [42]. In ﬂoor sensor based gait recognition, sensors
(e.g., force plates), which are usually installed under the ﬂoor,
are used for capturing gait features, such as ground reaction
force (GRF) [43] or heel-to-toe ratio [44].
Compared with vision-based and other non-accelerometer
based gait measurements, acceleration can reﬂect the dynamics
of gait more directly and faithfully. For instance, accelerom-
eter based gait recognition do not suffer from the existing
problems for vision-based methods, like occlusions, clutter,
and viewpoint changes. Existing works of wearable sensor
based gait recognition are mainly based on the use of body-
worn accelerometers. The ﬁrst work of accelerometer based
gait recognition is proposed by Ailisto et al. [8] and further
developed by Gafurov et al. [45]. In the initial stages, dedicated
accelerometers were used and worn on different body posi-
tions, such as lower leg [45], waist [8], hip [46], hip pocket,
chest pocket and hand [47]. With the prevailing of smartphone,
researchers have proposed several gait-based authentication
systems by utilizing the built-in accelerometer [48], [4], [49].
In a previous work, the researchers analyzed human gait by
a shoe-embedded piezoelectric energy harvester [50]. Weitao
et al. [51] proposed an automatic key generation system for
on-body devices by using gait.
Studies on KEH: There has been extensive studies on
wearable sensors. However, wearable sensors consume power
and most existing wearable products are powered by batteries.
Therefore, frequent recharge and replacement of the batteries
are required, which has become the main obstacle on the way
of achieving continuous gait recognition. To overcome this
problem, researchers are investigating to use the output signal
from KEH to achieve a wide range of applications in activity
tracking [15], [52] and health monitoring [53]. In [15], [52],
the authors proposed the idea of using the energy harvesting
power signal for human activities recognition. Their proposed
system can achieve 83% of accuracy for activities recognition.
In [53], the authors conducted the ﬁrst experiment study of
using the output voltage signal from the PEH to estimate
calorie expenditure of human activities. They have shown
promising results of replacing accelerometer using KEH for
calorie expenditure. Following this trend of study, the proposed
KEH-Gait utilizes the voltage signal generated by the kinetic
energy harvester from walking to perform gait recognition.
By doing so, KEH-Gait can reduce the power consumption of
the gait recognition in the wearable device by not using the
accelerometer.
X. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using KEH
to address the problem of user spooﬁng attacks in emerging
mobile healthcare systems. In particular, we present KEH-
Gait, a kinetic energy harvesting signal based gait recognition
system for user authentication. By not using the accelerometer,
the proposed KEH-Gait eliminates the need for powering the
accelerometer, making gait recognition practical for future
self-powered devices. We design and implement hardware
platforms to collect voltage data from two types of KEH,
PEH and EEH. Evaluation results based on a dataset of
20 subjects show that, using a novel classiﬁcation method
(MSSRC), KEH-Gait is able to achieve recognition accuracy
comparable to accelerometer-based gait recognition. Besides,
KEH-Gait improves recognition accuracy by up to 10% com-
pared to several state-of-the-art classiﬁcation algorithms. More
importantly, compared to conventional accelerometer-based
gait detection, KEH-Gait can reduce energy consumption by
78.15%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work
that experimentally validates the feasibility of gait recognition
using KEH, and our results show that
the output voltage
signal of energy harvester is a promising informative signal
for wearable authentication system.
