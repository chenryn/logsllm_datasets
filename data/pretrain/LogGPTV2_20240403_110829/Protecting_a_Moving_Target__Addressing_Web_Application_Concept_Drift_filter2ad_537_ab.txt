### Analysis of Web Application Changes

**Figure 1: Frequency and Time Intervals of Changes in Forms and Input Fields**

- **(a) Standard Deviation of the Number of Forms (stdev(|F|))**
  - The relative frequency of the standard deviation of the number of forms is plotted. This shows the variability in the number of forms across different websites.
  
- **(b) Average Time Between Changes in the Number of Forms (E[T] between changes in |F| [hours])**
  - The distribution of the expected time between changes in the number of forms is shown. This indicates how frequently the number of forms on a website changes over time.

- **(c) Standard Deviation of the Number of Input Fields (stdev(|I|))**
  - The relative frequency of the standard deviation of the number of input fields is plotted. This shows the variability in the number of input fields across different websites.
  
- **(d) Average Time Between Changes in the Number of Input Fields (E[T] between changes in |I| [hours])**
  - The distribution of the expected time between changes in the number of input fields is shown. This indicates how frequently the number of input fields on a website changes over time.

**Observations:**
- A significant portion of the websites exhibit changes in the number of forms and input fields, as indicated by the non-negligible standard deviations.
- The average time between changes in the number of forms and input fields is finite, confirming that these changes occur at regular intervals.

### Detailed Monitoring of Large, Data-Centric Web Applications

For the second experiment, we conducted an in-depth monitoring of three large, data-centric web applications over several months: Yahoo! Mail, YouTube, and MySpace. We captured HTTP responses by emulating user interactions using a custom, scriptable web browser implemented with HtmlUnit. Examples of these interactions include:
- Visiting the home page
- Logging in
- Browsing the inbox
- Sending messages
- Returning to the home page
- Clicking links
- Logging out

**Findings:**
- Manual inspection revealed significant changes in Yahoo! Mail. For instance, a set of new features was added to the search engine, including local search and refined address functionality.

### Addressing Web Application Concept Drift

**Figure 2: Changes in Response Sizes Over Time**

- The figure shows the changes in response sizes for the monitored web applications over time. The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis represents the response size in bytes.
- Notable changes in response sizes were observed, indicating that the web applications are continuously evolving and adapting to user needs and technological advancements.

**Conclusion:**
- The analysis confirms that a significant portion of web applications exhibit frequent changes in their structure and content. These changes are essential for maintaining the relevance and functionality of the applications. Understanding and addressing these changes is crucial for effective web application management and security.
