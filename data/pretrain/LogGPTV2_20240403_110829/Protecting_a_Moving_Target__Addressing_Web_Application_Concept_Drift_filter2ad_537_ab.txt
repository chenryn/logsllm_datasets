ﬁnite E[TF ]. Similarly, 29.15% of the websites exhibited drifts in the number of
input ﬁelds, i.e., E[TI] < +∞ for 660 websites. Figure 1 shows the relative fre-
quency of (b) E[TF ], and (d) E[TI]. E[TF ]. This conﬁrms that a non-negligible
portion of the websites exhibit signiﬁcantly frequent changes in the responses.
For the second experiment, we monitored in depth three large, data-centric
web applications over several months: Yahoo! Mail, YouTube, and MySpace. We
dumped HTTP responses captured by emulating user interaction using a custom,
scriptable web browser implemented with HtmlUnit. Examples of these interac-
tions are as follows: visit the home page, login, browse the inbox, send messages,
return to the home page, click links, log out. Manual inspection revealed some
major changes in Yahoo! Mail. For instance, the most evident change consisted of
a set of new features added to the search engine (e.g., local search, reﬁned address
