User:  Please describe how you monitor the resource usage of a Linux server and perform performance analysis.
Assistant: The following steps can be followed to monitor the resource usage of a Linux server: 1. Use the top or htop command to check the CPU, memory, disk, and network usage of the system. The top command can sort by different columns, and htop provides more interactive functions. 2. Use the free command to view the memory usage of the system, including free memory, memory in use, and buffer/cache area. Use the sar command to track the usage of various indicators in the system, such as CPU usage, disk read and write speed, and memory usage. 3. Use the df or du command to check the disk usage. The df command is used to display the disk space usage of the file system, while the du command displays the disk usage of the current directory and subdirectories. 4. Use the netstat command to view network connection status and traffic conditions, including listening ports, active connections, and filtering options. In terms of performance analysis, the following tools can be used for measurement and analysis: 1. The vmstat command is used to monitor performance indicators such as virtual memory, CPU, disk, and IO of the system. By checking the values of various parameters, most of the performance statistics can be obtained. 2. The iostat command can be used to get average values of disk patches, read/write/extend disk region run times, and number of operations per second, etc. 3. The "P", "M" and "N" options of the top command are sorted by CPU, memory and PID respectively, and the columns and sorting methods can also be adjusted through other options. Provides performance indicators of different dimensions. 4. The lsof command is used to obtain detailed information about open files and ports, including file descriptors, current processes, file types, etc. This tool is especially useful for troubleshooting issues such as file usage.
