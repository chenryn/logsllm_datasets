Progress in 2004
In 2004, the Semantic Web Services Initiative (SWSI), an initiative of academic and
industrial researchers – from Europe, Asia and the United States – has been composed
to create infrastructure that combines Semantic Web and Web services to enable the
automation in all aspects of Web services. In addition to providing further evolution
of OWL-S, SWSI will also be a forum for working towards convergence of OWL-S
with the products of the SWWS/WSMO/WSML/WSMX research effort, which
supplies Web service providers with a core set of constructs for describing the
properties of their Web services in computer-interpretable form.
Ongoing projects, such as OWL-S, LSDIS METEOR-S, and DERI SWWS
studied important aspects related to the lifecycle of semantic web processes. Industrial
researchers have also been deeply involved in the definition of standards assuring the
real world implementation and use of Semantics, Web services, and Web processes.
Ongoing work on standards included the Business Process Execution Language for
Web Services (BPEL4WS, or simply BPEL) (from Microsoft, IBM, BEA), WSCL
(from HP), BPML (from Microsoft), WSCI (from SUN, BEA, Yahoo, and other),
XLANG (from Microsoft), and WSFL (from IBM).
Trends for 2005
According to analysts, the Semantic Web, which will understand human language,
will replace the current Web by 2005. The progresses made are slow but steady.
Therefore, we believed that this milestone will be more likely pushed to 2010.
Important aspects of research that need to be further explored include functional
and behavioral descriptions of Web services and Web processes.
Nowadays, there are few commercial products available that have successfully
implemented a semantic layer alongside robust a Web services infrastructure, this
despite significant industrial support which exists for standards such as WSDL,
BPEL, and UDDI. Many vendors seem to be taking a “wait-and-see” approach while
the emerging standards converge.
In 2005, the hesitation shared by most commercial vendors will not be shared by
many industrial research groups – IBM, HP, France Telecom, and Fujitsu have will
further apply semantics to Web services for innovative, discovery-driven use cases.
Leadership from DERI and the W3C have each expressed a strong interest in
converging the best of each specification – vendors will no doubt wait for this
alignment, which could occur in 2005, prior to implementing either on their own.
