Figure 9. Fault coverage given by the 3 best
exact detours.
Figure 9 shows the fault coverage results for all graphs,
given by the use of the 3 best detours. We can observe that
the fault coverage given by the best exact detour is smaller
than the fault coverage given by the second and third best
exact detours.
If the vertex chosen to be a detour belongs to the network
route used by the source node to communicate with the des-
tination node, there is a high probability that the alternative
route created through the detour is identical to the the faulty
route, and it is not possible to cover such a fault. The fault
coverage given by the best exact detour is worse than the
fault coverage given by the second best exact detour, as is
shown in the ﬁgure 9. This result can be explained by the
fact that the percentage of times in which the best exact de-
tour belongs to the path used by the communicating nodes
is higher than the percentage of times in which the second
best exact detour belongs to the path used by the commu-
nicating nodes, as we can see in ﬁgure 10. We can see that

the difference between the percentage of times in which the
best exact detour belongs to the path used by the communi-
cating vertices and the percentage of times in which the best
exact detour belongs to the path used by the communicating
vertices decreases according to the increase of the average
vertex degree. This explains the fact that the difference of
the fault coverage given by the second best detour and the
fault coverage given by the best detour decreases as the av-
erage vertex degree increases, as is shown in the ﬁgure 9.
We conclude that the detour selection strategy based only
on the connectivity criteria did not obtain the expected re-
sults. Below we show the reason that happened, and how it
can be solved by selecting detours that do not belong to the
network route.
4.2.2 Fault Coverage Given by Exact Detours that Do
Not Belong to the Network Route
Figure 11 presents the fault coverage given by the 3 best
exact detours that does not belong to the network route used
by the communicating vertices. We can observe that the
fault coverage given by the best detour is higher than the
fault coverage given by the second best detour, which in
turn is higher than the fault coverage given by the third best
detour.
Comparing results in ﬁgure 11 and in ﬁgure 9, we can
see that the fault coverage given by exact detours that do
not belong to the network route used by the communicating
vertices is higher than the fault coverage given by exact de-
tours that may belong to that route. Results show that 98.7%
of the alternative routes created through detours that could
belong to the network route were faulty.
Figure 11 shows that the fault coverage given by exact
detours that do not belong to the network route in graphs

with average vertex degree equal to 3 is 70%.
In other
words, even in graphs with a small number of edges, the
fault coverage can be considered to be high. We can see
that, as expected, the fault coverage increases with the in-
crease of the average node degree, reaching 90% in graphs
with average vertex degree equal to 8. Figure 12 presents
the accumulated fault coverage given by the 3 best exact
detours that do not belong to the network route used by the
communicating vertices. We can see that the fault coverage
given by the 3 best exact detours that do not belong to the
network route is 87%, in graphs with an average vertex de-
gree equal to 3. For graphs with average vertex degree equal
to 4.4, the fault coverage is 95%. For graphs with average
vertex degree equal to 6.8, the fault coverage is 98%.
We conclude that the detour selection strategy based on

the proposed connectivity criteria, considering vertices that
do not belong to the path used by the communicating nodes
has given the expected results.
4.2.3 Fault Coverage Obtained by Heuristic Detours
that Do Not Belong to the Network Route
Figure 13 presents the fault coverage given by the best
heuristic detour that does not belong to the network route
used by the communicating node and the fault coverage
given by the best exact detour that does not belong to the
path used by the communicating node. We conclude that
the heuristic gives results that are close to those of the exact
algorithm.

5. Conclusions
This paper introduced the use of highly connected de-
tours in order to allow network nodes to keep communi-
cating during the routing convergence latency interval. De-
tours are selected based on their connectivity. Nodes that
belong to highly connected network components present a
larger number of distinct paths to choose from, thus increas-
ing the probability that the detour will work correctly in the
presence of unknown network faults.
We described new criteria for assessing the connectivity
of every network node (cid:0): the connectivity number (cid:0)(cid:1)(cid:0)
and the network subset   (cid:1)(cid:0) to which (cid:0) belongs. Ex-
act algorithms for computing these criteria are given, which
are based on the classic concept of cut trees. A fast heuris-
tic to compute (cid:0)(cid:1)(cid:0) was also given. Experimental results
show that the heuristic and exact algorithm produce close
results.
We evaluated the fault coverage of the new approach by
computing the percentage of packets that were correctly de-
livered after a fault occurred in the network route being
used. Results were obtained with simulation on random
Internet-like graphs generated with the Waxman method.
The fault coverage is up to 90% when the best detour is em-
ployed, that does not belong to the route being previously
used. When the three best detours are employed, the fault
coverage is up to 98%.
Future work includes the speciﬁcation of a routing pro-
tocol based on the proposed criteria.
