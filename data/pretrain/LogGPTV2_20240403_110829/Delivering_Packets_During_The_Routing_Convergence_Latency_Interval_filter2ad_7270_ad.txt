### 3. Fault Coverage Analysis

#### 3.1 Fault Coverage with Best Exact Detours

**Figure 9.** Fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours.

Figure 9 illustrates the fault coverage results for all graphs using the three best detours. It is evident that the fault coverage provided by the best exact detour is lower than that of the second and third best exact detours.

If a chosen detour vertex is part of the network route used by the source node to communicate with the destination node, there is a high likelihood that the alternative route created through the detour will be identical to the faulty route, thus failing to cover the fault. This explains why the fault coverage of the best exact detour is worse than that of the second best exact detour, as shown in Figure 9. The higher frequency of the best exact detour being part of the communication path compared to the second best exact detour can be seen in Figure 10.

**Figure 10.** Percentage of times the best exact detours are part of the network route used by the communicating vertices.

As the average vertex degree increases, the difference between the percentage of times the best exact detour is part of the communication path and the percentage of times the second best exact detour is part of the communication path decreases. This explains why the difference in fault coverage between the second best detour and the best detour decreases as the average vertex degree increases, as depicted in Figure 9.

We conclude that a detour selection strategy based solely on connectivity criteria did not yield the expected results. Below, we explain the reason for this and propose a solution by selecting detours that do not belong to the network route.

#### 3.2 Fault Coverage with Exact Detours Not on the Network Route

**Figure 11.** Fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating vertices.

Figure 11 shows the fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating vertices. We observe that the fault coverage of the best detour is higher than that of the second best detour, which in turn is higher than that of the third best detour.

Comparing the results in Figures 11 and 9, it is clear that the fault coverage provided by exact detours that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating vertices is higher than that of exact detours that may belong to the route. Results indicate that 98.7% of the alternative routes created through detours that could belong to the network route were faulty.

**Figure 12.** Accumulated fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating vertices.

Figure 12 presents the accumulated fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating vertices. For graphs with an average vertex degree of 3, the fault coverage is 70%. Even in graphs with a small number of edges, the fault coverage is considered high. As expected, the fault coverage increases with the increase in the average vertex degree, reaching 90% in graphs with an average vertex degree of 8. The accumulated fault coverage provided by the three best exact detours that do not belong to the network route is 87% in graphs with an average vertex degree of 3. For graphs with an average vertex degree of 4.4, the fault coverage is 95%, and for graphs with an average vertex degree of 6.8, the fault coverage is 98%.

We conclude that the detour selection strategy based on the proposed connectivity criteria, considering vertices that do not belong to the path used by the communicating nodes, has yielded the expected results.

#### 3.3 Fault Coverage with Heuristic Detours Not on the Network Route

**Figure 13.** Fault coverage provided by the best heuristic detour and the best exact detour that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating nodes.

Figure 13 compares the fault coverage provided by the best heuristic detour and the best exact detour that do not belong to the network route used by the communicating nodes. The results show that the heuristic approach provides results close to those of the exact algorithm.

### 4. Conclusions

This paper introduces the use of highly connected detours to allow network nodes to maintain communication during the routing convergence latency interval. Detours are selected based on their connectivity. Nodes that belong to highly connected network components have a larger number of distinct paths to choose from, increasing the probability that the detour will function correctly in the presence of unknown network faults.

We described new criteria for assessing the connectivity of each network node: the connectivity number and the network subset to which the node belongs. Exact algorithms for computing these criteria, based on the classic concept of cut trees, are provided, along with a fast heuristic for computing the connectivity number. Experimental results show that the heuristic and exact algorithm produce similar results.

The fault coverage of the new approach was evaluated by computing the percentage of packets correctly delivered after a fault occurred in the network route. Results were obtained through simulations on random Internet-like graphs generated using the Waxman method. The fault coverage reaches up to 90% when the best detour is employed, and up to 98% when the three best detours are used.

Future work includes the specification of a routing protocol based on the proposed criteria.
