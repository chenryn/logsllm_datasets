page with the HTML link element, and the rules will be applied
to the attacker page. If a page dynamically changes these rules, an
attacker can detect these differences depending on the user state.
For example, websites will often serve different CSS depending on
whether the user is logged in. As a leak technique, the attacker can
include the targeted CSS file to use the window.getComputedStyle
method to read CSS properties of a specific HTML element. As a
result, an attacker can read arbitrary CSS properties if the affected
element and property name is known.
A.5 Detectable Difference: Header
In some cases, the presence of HTTP headers can be detected. This
includes headers such as X-Frame-Options, Content-Type, and
Content-Disposition.
Performance API XFO The Performance API is used to access
performance information of the current page [29]. This includes
detailed network timing data for the document and every resource
the page loads. Terjanq [55] showed that when a resource has
X-Frame-Options header set and is included with an object tag, it
will not create an resource timing entry in the Performance API (cf.
Section 5.2).
CSP Directive. A new feature in GC allows web pages to pro-
poses a CSP by setting an attribute on an iframe element. The policy
directives are transmitted along with the HTTP request. Normally,
the embedded content must explicitly allow this with an HTTP
header, otherwise an error page is displayed. However, if the iframe
already ships a CSP and the new policy is not stricter, the page will
display normally.
