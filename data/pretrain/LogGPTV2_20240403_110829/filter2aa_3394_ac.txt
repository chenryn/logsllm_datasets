Analysis Considerations Definitions
This subsection provides detailed consideration definitions and comments on their
relevance to public safety requirements and operations.
Spectrum Efficiency - This is a measurement of the number of half-duplex radio
communication channels, voice or data, provided by an LMR system versus the amount of
spectrum required by that system.  For the purposes of this analysis, spectrum efficiency is
measured by the number of communications channels per 25 kHz of spectral bandwidth.  Thus, a
system occupying 25 kHz of spectral bandwidth and providing one half-duplex voice channel
would be measured as 1channel/25 kHz.
Grade of Service (GOS) - GOS is typically defined as the probability of an inbound
communications call, i.e., a PTT, not being blocked in an attempt to reach a central traffic server.
Depending upon the distribution model being used, this probability could be measured against a
requirement either for immediate service or within a prescribed time delay.
Network Capacity - This consideration analyzes the number of users that an LMR system
can support within a specific geographic area.  The number of users supported typically varies
based on the number of channels available and the usage characteristics anticipated.
Call Setup Time - Call setup time is an important system parameter showing how quickly
a user can begin communicating over a particular system. Call setup time is defined as the time
passed between the user’s pushing the PTT button and the radio’s response that the system is
ready to accept the call. It measures the speed of network response to a user’s request for
communications.  Call setup time typically consists of radio power on, propagation, call
processing, time-in-queue, and synchronization delays and is usually measured in milliseconds
(ms).
For systems that require synchronized operation of base and mobile radios and systems in
an encrypted mode, a synchronization delay may significantly increase call setup time.  Due to
differences in protocol and operation, call setup times are different for conventional, trunked,
clear, and encrypted systems.
Call setup time is affected by system architecture and configuration, the speed of
switching equipment and software, the configuration of a particular call, as well as by the traffic
load at that particular time.  This analysis consideration describes the impact of trunking on call
setup time.
Network Architecture - This describes the amount and type of LMR specific hardware or
related components required fielding a "typical" network configuration.  Components may
include but are not limited to the following network architecture elements:
• System Controllers

• Base stations/Repeaters
• Dispatch Consoles
• Switching Equipment
• System Control Computers
• Telephone Interconnects
• Satellite receivers (receive-only remote sites)
• Voter/comparators
• Data Network Gateways
• Scanners
These components include only the elements required to process or broadcast LMR
transmissions in a typical configuration.  Although communication transport mediums and
related hardware, such as telephone lines, microwave links, and multiplexer/demultiplexers, are a
part of network architecture, they are site specific and are not included in this analysis.
Network Scalability - This analysis consideration addresses the ability to seamlessly
increase system capacity by adding communication voice or data channels:
•
Ability to seamlessly add additional system features for system-wide users or
individual user groups.  Features include items such as tone codes, telephone patch
capability, user ID, and over-the-air rekeying of the encryption key
•
Ability to seamlessly support new communications applications in the form of new
data features such as mobile data transmissions, SCADA (Supervisory Control and
Data Acquisition) telemetry, short messaging, still frame video, etc.
•
Ability to add additional sites (transmit, receive, or transmit and receive) to
accommodate system growth.
Many specific equipment features affecting scalability are dependent on the vendor.  To
remain vendor-independent, this analysis does not compare individual features and applications
available, but rather determines whether the systems are capable of expansion.
Network Encryption - The encryption of information at its origin and decryption at its
intended destination without any intermediate decryption.  The evolution of LMR technology
toward digital provides a solid basis for encrypted communications.  At the same time,
encryption has some negative effects.  These can include an increase in call setup time for both
conventional and trunked systems, deterioration of voice quality, decrease in the throughput rate
for data applications, and a reduced radio coverage area.  The study quantifies these changes for
each type of system.
Network Security - Network security consists of features that prevent unauthorized
personnel from accessing system components or communications.  Such actions include
jamming, eavesdropping, spoofing, and physical sabotage.  The analysis defines the areas of
vulnerability, including physical, such as computer-based electronic intrusion, and RF
transmission.

Network Robustness - A robust network degrades in such a manner that it continues to
operate, but provides a reduced level of service rather than failing completely.  In the comparison
of conventional and trunked systems, it is necessary to compare systems of the same generation.
This study focuses on advanced digital systems.  Many specific equipment features affecting
robustness are dependent on the standard and vendor used.  The analysis compares the capability
of conventional and trunked systems to withstand single or multiple faults.
Multiorganizational Interoperability - This analysis consideration evaluates the ability of
each system to support interoperability between more than one user organization while providing
a similar set of features.
Ability To Handle Multiple Voice and Data Applications - This analysis describes the
system capability to seamlessly support voice and data traffic using common channels or user
groups.  It compares any existing inherent advantages/disadvantages of conventional or trunked
systems for data voice/data integration.
Technology Evolution - This section analyzes the impact of technology evolution on
existing and planned LMR systems and the risks assumed when selecting a conventional or
trunked system type.  It also gives a five-year forecast for LMR technology trends, as well as the
impact of the emerging standards, such as TIA/EIA-102.
Policy Impact - This section analyzes the impact of Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA)
policies on architecture selection.
Compatibility with Legacy Systems - This analysis determines whether the newer digital
conventional/trunked systems or their components will interoperate with existing (legacy) analog
conventional FM systems over the air interface.  The analysis determines whether compatibility
depends on system type (conventional or trunked).  If interoperability cannot be achieved through
little or no system re-configuration, such systems are considered incompatible.
Required User Discipline - This analyzes the network discipline required of users to
ensure that multiple parties can easily share a common set of channels.  For the purposes of this
study, user discipline includes the discipline or control required on the part of users, so that they
do not collide with other users’ communications within the same channel.
Network Management - The analysis describes the requirements for and the complexity
of conducting network and system management for conventional and trunked types of systems,
including maintenance, radio and call group allocation, upgrading (software, hardware),
optimizing performance, encryption key management, over-the-air features, and interoperability
with other systems (if possible).
Network Operator Training - This analysis consideration describes the amount and types
of training required by typical system operators and on-site radio technicians to assure they have
the skills required to maintain day-to-day system operation.  System operators include radio

system managers employed by the user agency.  Technicians are those individuals employed by
the user agency to handle system maintenance, trouble-shooting, and repair.
Network Cost Effectiveness - This analysis provides general cost information on the
different architecture alternatives to aid decision making regarding system cost, with a chart
showing cost per user for different types of networks.
Considerations for Migration to Trunking - This analysis provides general information
on the alternatives for migration to a trunked system.
