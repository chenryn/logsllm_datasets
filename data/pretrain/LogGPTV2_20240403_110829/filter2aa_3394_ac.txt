### High-Level Definitions of Analysis Considerations

#### 1. Scalability
**Description:**
Scalability refers to the ability of a network to seamlessly increase capacity, integrate new features, or support new communications applications without significant disruption. This includes:
- **Capacity Expansion:** Adding communication voice or data channels.
- **Feature Integration:** Incorporating system-wide or user-specific features such as tone codes, telephone patch capability, user ID, and over-the-air rekeying of encryption keys.
- **New Applications:** Supporting new data features like mobile data transmissions, SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) telemetry, short messaging, and still frame video.

#### 2. Network Encryption
**Description:**
Network encryption involves encrypting information at its origin and decrypting it at its destination without any intermediate decryption. The evolution of LMR (Land Mobile Radio) technology toward digital provides a solid basis for encrypted communications. However, encryption can have negative effects, including:
- Increased call setup time.
- Deterioration of voice quality.
- Decreased throughput rate for data applications.
- Reduced radio coverage area.

#### 3. Network Security
**Description:**
Network security measures the level of system vulnerability to transmission and computer-based electronic intrusion. It includes features that prevent unauthorized personnel from accessing system components or communications, such as:
- Jamming
- Eavesdropping
- Spoofing
- Physical sabotage

#### 4. Network Robustness
**Description:**
Robustness measures the network's ability to withstand single or multiple faults without service degradation and the time needed to recover from them. A robust network continues to operate but may provide a reduced level of service rather than failing completely. The analysis compares the robustness of conventional and trunked systems, focusing on advanced digital systems.

#### 5. Multiorganizational Interoperability
**Description:**
Interoperability describes the ability of each system to support seamless communication between more than one user organization while providing a similar set of features. This is crucial for ensuring that different organizations can communicate effectively during emergencies or joint operations.

#### 6. Support for Multiple Voice and Data Applications
**Description:**
This consideration evaluates the system's capability to seamlessly support both voice and data traffic using common channels or user groups. It compares the inherent advantages and disadvantages of conventional and trunked systems in handling data and voice integration.

#### 7. Technology Evolution
**Description:**
Technology evolution examines the potential impact of technological advancements on existing and planned LMR systems. This includes the introduction of new system and user features, as well as a five-year forecast for LMR technology trends and the impact of emerging standards such as TIA/EIA-102.

#### 8. Policy Impact
**Description:**
Policy impact analyzes the influence of FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and NTIA (National Telecommunications & Information Administration) policies on architecture selection. This includes legislative policies or actions that will affect the system's architecture.

#### 9. Compatibility with Legacy Systems
**Description:**
Compatibility with legacy systems assesses the system's ability to interoperate with existing analog systems. It determines whether newer digital conventional or trunked systems can work with legacy analog FM systems over the air interface, and if interoperability depends on system type (conventional or trunked).

#### 10. Required User Discipline
**Description:**
User discipline refers to the level of user control needed to ensure that multiple parties can concurrently use a common set of channels without interfering with each other. This includes the discipline required to avoid collisions and ensure efficient channel usage.

#### 11. Network Management
**Description:**
Network management describes the requirements and complexity of conducting network and system management. This includes maintenance, radio and call group allocation, upgrading (software, hardware), optimizing performance, encryption key management, over-the-air features, and interoperability with other systems.

#### 12. Network Operator Training
**Description:**
Operator training outlines the amount and types of training required by system operators and on-site radio technicians to ensure they have the skills needed to maintain day-to-day system operation. This includes training for radio system managers and technicians employed by the user agency.

#### 13. Network Cost Effectiveness
**Description:**
Cost effectiveness provides general cost information on different architecture alternatives to aid decision-making. This includes a chart showing the cost per user for different types of networks, helping to identify the most cost-effective solution.

#### 14. Migration to Trunking
**Description:**
Migration to trunking provides general information on the alternatives for migrating to a trunked system. This includes considerations for transitioning from conventional to trunked systems, including the benefits and challenges of such a migration.
