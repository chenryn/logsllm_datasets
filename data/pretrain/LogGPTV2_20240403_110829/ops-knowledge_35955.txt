User: What are the common problems when using Docker to deploy web applications? Please list and give a solution.
Assistant: 1. Port conflict: When using Docker to deploy multiple containers, port conflicts may occur. The solution is to specify a different port when starting the container. 2. Storage volume permission issues: When using Docker to mount storage volumes, there may be permission issues that make it impossible to read or write files. The solution is to specify the correct permissions when starting the container, or use the user mapping functionality provided by Docker. 3. Slow image pulling speed: When pulling the Docker image, the speed may be slow or the connection may not be possible due to network reasons. The solution is to use an accelerator or choose a reliable mirror source. 4. Configuration file management issues: When using Docker to deploy web applications, you may need to manage a large number of configuration files. The solution is to use the configuration file management features provided by Docker, or package the configuration files inside the container. 5. Data loss after the container restarts: When using Docker to mount storage volumes, the mounted data may be lost when the container restarts. The solution is to store data in persistent storage, such as using cloud storage or local file system mounts. 6. Difficult to adjust resource limits: When using Docker to deploy web applications, it may be necessary to adjust container resource limits, such as CPU and memory. The solution is to use the resource limit function provided by Docker, or manage container resources through container orchestration tools.
