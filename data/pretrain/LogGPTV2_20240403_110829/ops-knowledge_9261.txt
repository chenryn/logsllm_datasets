**Question: How to Install Missing Drivers in the Recovery Console**

I am currently testing a bare-metal restore on a system, but I'm encountering an issue with the new hardware. The new hardware does not support PS/2 mice and keyboards, and it requires USB drivers. As a result, I am unable to log into any of the Safe Modes.

However, I can insert the original SBS 2003 installation disks into the machine and access the Recovery Console.

**How can I install the necessary chipset and USB drivers? Is it as simple as copying files, and if so, which files should I copy and where should I place them?**
