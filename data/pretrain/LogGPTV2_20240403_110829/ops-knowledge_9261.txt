User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题How do I install missing drivers in the Recovery Console? I'm testing a backup to a bare metal restore.  The new hardware doesn't have PS2 Mice/Keyboard and needs USB drivers: I can't log into any of the Safe Modes.

I can however, put the original SBS2003 install disks in the machine and jump into Recovery Console.

How do I go about installing board Chip Set drivers and USB drivers?  Is it a simple copy?  If so, what to where?
