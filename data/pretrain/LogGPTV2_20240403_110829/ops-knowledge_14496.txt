User: According to the following server configuration information, calculate the CPU utilization and disk space utilization of the system Number of CPU cores: 8 CPU usage: 20% Total disk space: 500GB Used disk space: 200GB
Assistant: CPU utilization = CPU usage / number of CPU cores * 100% = 20/8 * 100% = 2.5% Disk space utilization = used disk space / total disk space * 100% = 200/500*100% = 40%
