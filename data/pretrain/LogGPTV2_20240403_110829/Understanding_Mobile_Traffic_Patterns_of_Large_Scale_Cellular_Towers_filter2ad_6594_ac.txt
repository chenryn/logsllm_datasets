### Figure 9: Pie Chart of Averaged Normalized Points of Interest for Five Clusters

Figure 9 provides a pie chart that summarizes the distribution of points of interest (POIs) across five clusters, as detailed in Table 3. The maximum value in each row and column is highlighted, indicating the dominant urban function within each cluster. Specifically, Figure 9 illustrates the percentage of each POI type in the five clusters. According to Table 3 and Figure 9, the transport area is dominated by transport-related POIs, which account for 44% of the POIs in this region. Similarly, the entertainment area is characterized by a 39% share of entertainment-related POIs. These findings validate the labels assigned to the sampled towers in each cluster.

In summary, this subsection confirms our identified key traffic patterns and establishes their relationships with the corresponding urban functional regions.

### 4. Understanding Modeled Traffic Patterns: Time Domain Aspect

Understanding the underlying physical meanings of traffic patterns is crucial for addressing practical issues such as traffic load balancing and land use identification. Although we have identified key traffic patterns and linked them to specific urban functional regions, the hidden physical meanings of these patterns remain unclear. This section aims to analyze the time and geographical characteristics of the modeled traffic patterns.

#### 4.1 Quantify Time-Domain Characteristics

It is evident that different urban functional regions exhibit distinct time-domain characteristics in their traffic patterns. In this subsection, we quantify these characteristics to provide insights into the traffic behaviors in various urban areas.

**Weekday-Weekend Traffic Amount Ratio:**
Observing Figure 6, the traffic volume during weekdays differs significantly from weekends in the transport and office areas. We quantify this characteristic by calculating the ratio of weekday traffic to weekend traffic, as shown in Figure 10(a). According to Figure 10(a), the traffic volume in residential, entertainment, and comprehensive areas remains almost identical between weekdays and weekends. However, the weekday-weekend traffic amount ratio in the transport area is 1.49, and in the office area, it is 1.79, indicating that these regions experience significantly more traffic on weekdays. This observation aligns with the fact that people typically commute to work on weekdays but not on weekends.

**Peak-Valley Features:**
From Figure 6, all traffic patterns exhibit periodic peaks and valleys, but they differ in peak values, valley values, and peak-valley ratios. We quantify these characteristics and summarize them in Table 4. As per Table 4, the maximum and minimum traffic volumes in the transport and office areas are much lower on weekends compared to weekdays, consistent with the previous finding. Additionally, the transport area has a higher peak-valley ratio than other regions, as depicted in Figure 10(b). However, the transport area's maximum traffic volume is lower than other regions on both weekdays and weekends, suggesting that it has the least overall traffic but the largest peak-valley difference. In contrast, the residential and comprehensive areas show the opposite trend.

**Time of Traffic Peak and Valley:**
The traffic patterns in different urban functional regions vary not only in peak volume but also in peak and valley times. We quantify these characteristics and present them in Table 5. If there is no periodic peak or valley, the entry is left blank. From Table 5, we observe that the traffic valley consistently occurs between 4:00 and 5:00. On weekdays, the transport area has two peaks at 8:00 and 18:00, likely due to rush hours. In the entertainment area, the weekday traffic peak is at 18:00, while the weekend peak is at 12:30, indicating that people engage in entertainment later on weekdays due to work commitments.

In conclusion, we have quantified the time-domain characteristics of the identified traffic patterns, laying the groundwork for a deeper understanding of cellular traffic patterns.

#### 4.2 Interrelationships Between Traffic Patterns

We compare the interrelationships between normalized modeled traffic patterns in Figure 11. The first row of Figure 11 compares the traffic patterns of residential areas and transport hotspots. The peak in the residential area occurs about three hours after the second peak in the transport area, and the slopes of these peaks are nearly identical. Additionally, when comparing the traffic patterns of transport hotspots and business districts, we find that the peak in the business district falls between the two peaks of the transport area. These observations suggest that the traffic patterns in these three areas are interrelated, likely reflecting the daily routines of working populations who commute through heavy traffic areas in the morning and return home in the evening.

In the third row of Figure 11, the blue line represents the traffic pattern in the comprehensive area, and the red line represents the average traffic pattern of all cell towers. We find that these two patterns are highly similar, indicating that the comprehensive area is indeed a mix of the other four types of functional areas. In summary, we analyze the interrelationships between the traffic patterns of different urban functional regions, providing valuable insights.

### 5. Frequency-Domain Representation for Traffic Modeling

In this section, we conduct frequency-domain analysis, motivated by the inherent time-domain periodicity of traffic and the limitations of pure time-domain traffic analysis. For example, while we know that traffic in the office area reaches its lowest point on weekends and that traffic in the transport area has two daily peaks, it is challenging to determine which characteristic will dominate for a cell tower with both features. In the frequency domain, we can quantify these characteristics using the amplitude and phase of frequencies corresponding to one day and one week, allowing us to compare the strengths of different traffic characteristics for a single cell tower. This raises the question: what are the most discriminating and essential features to represent traffic patterns of cellular towers? To answer this, we perform frequency-domain analysis on the five extracted patterns, revealing several important discoveries.

#### 5.1 Frequency Transform

To analyze the strong periodicity in the time domain, we first apply the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to the time-domain traffic vector \( X = (x[1], \ldots, x[N])^T \). \( X \) can be either the time-domain traffic vector of a single cellular tower, \( X_j \), or the aggregate traffic vector of a cluster, \( \sum_{j \in C} X_j \) for cluster \( C \). The process can be formulated as follows:

\[
\hat{X}[k] = \sum_{n=1}^{N} x[n] e^{-2\pi i k n / N}
\]

This transformation allows us to capture and compare the key periodic components of traffic patterns in the frequency domain.
