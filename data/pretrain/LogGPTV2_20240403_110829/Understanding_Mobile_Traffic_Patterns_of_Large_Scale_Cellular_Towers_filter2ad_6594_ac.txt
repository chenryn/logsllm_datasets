which is summarized in Table 3. The maximum of each row
and column is marked with color, which shows the dominan-
t urban function in each cluster. Figure 9 explicitly shows
each POI’s percentage in ﬁve clusters. According to Table 3
and Figure 9, transport type POI dominates the region la-
beled as transport area, with 44% of this area’s POI, while
entertainment area is dominated by entertainment type POI
for 39%. These measurements validate the labels obtained
from the sampled towers of each cluster.
To conclude, in this subsection we verify our identiﬁed key
traﬃc patterns as well as establish their relationships with
urban functional regions.
4. UNDERSTANDING MODELED TRAFFIC
PATTERNS: TIME DOMAIN ASPECT
Understanding the hidden physical meanings of traﬃc pat-
terns is important for exploiting them to solve practical
problems, such as traﬃc load balancing or land usage iden-
tiﬁcation. Although we have identiﬁed key traﬃc patterns
and linked them to corresponding urban functional regions,
we still have little knowledge of the hidden physical meaning
of these patterns. In this section, we conduct an analysis to
reveal the time and geographical characteristics of modeled
traﬃc patterns.
We start from quantifying the distinct time-domain char-
acteristics of each pattern and ﬁnd out the interrelationships
between these patterns. These time-domain characteristics

have not been quantiﬁed and the interrelationships between
these traﬃc patterns remain unknown, which are two ob-
stacles preventing us from further understanding these traf-
ﬁc patterns. Therefore, in order to understand the hidden
meaning of modeled patterns, we conduct the following s-
tudies.
4.1 Quantify Time-Domain Characteristics
It is obvious that traﬃc patterns of diﬀerent urban func-
tional regions possess diﬀerent characteristics in time-domain.
In this subsection, we dedicate to quantify these character-
istics and provide insights of traﬃc behaviours in diﬀerent
urban functional regions.
Weekday-Weekend traﬃc amount ratio: Observing
Figure 6, traﬃc amount during weekday is signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent from weekend in transport area and oﬃce area. We
quantify this characteristic by computing the ratio between
weekday’s traﬃc amount and weekend’s, which is presented
in Figure 10(a). According to Figure 10(a), one day’s traﬃc
amount in resident area, entertainment area and comprehen-
sive area is almost identical between weekday and weekend.
However, weekday-weekend traﬃc amount ratio in transport
area is 1.49 and the ratio in oﬃce area is 1.79, which sug-
gests weekday’s traﬃc amount of those two regions is much
more than weekend. This phenomenon makes sense because
people typically go to work in weekday while they do not in
weekend.
Peak-valley features: Observing Figure 6, all traﬃc pat-
terns experience periodic peaks and valleys. However, the
traﬃc patterns are signiﬁcantly diﬀerent in peak value, val-
ley value and peak-valley ratio. We quantify these char-
acteristics and summarize them in Table 4. According to
Table 4, in transport area and oﬃce area weekend’s maxi-
mum traﬃc and minimum traﬃc is much less than weekday,
which is consistent with last paragraph’s ﬁnding. What’s
more, the transport’s peak-valley ratio is much higher than
other regions, which is explicitly presented in Figure 10(b).
However, transport area’s maximum traﬃc is less than oth-
er regions both in weekday and weekend. It suggests that
transport area has the least traﬃc amount and the largest
peak-valley traﬃc diﬀerence, while resident area and com-
prehensive area are the opposite.
Time of traﬃc peak and valley: Diﬀerent urban func-
tional regions’ traﬃc patterns diﬀer not only in peak volume,
but also in peak time. We quantify this characteristic and
present it in Table 5. We leave the blank unﬁlled, if there
is not a periodic peak or valley. Observing Table 5, we ﬁnd

that traﬃc valley always takes place in 4:00∼5:00. In week-
day, transport area has two peaks in 8:00 and 18:00, which
are probably caused by rush hour. In entertainment area,
weekday’s traﬃc peak time is 18:00 while weekend’s traﬃc
peak time is 12:30. It suggests that people go for entertain-
ment later in weekday because of work.
To conclude, we quantify the time-domain characteristics
of each identiﬁed traﬃc pattern, which paves the way to-
wards a deep understanding of cellular traﬃc patterns.
4.2 Interrelationships Between Trafﬁc
Patterns
We compare the interrelationships between normalized
modeled traﬃc patterns in Figure 11. The ﬁrst row of Fig-
ure 11 compares the modeled traﬃc patterns of residential
areas and transport hot spots. The peak of residential area
is about 3 hours later than the second peak of transport,
and the slope of these two peaks is almost identical. In ad-
dition, when we compare traﬃc patterns of transport hot
spots and business district shown in Figure 11, we ﬁnd that
the peak in business district takes place in the time period
between the two peaks of transport hot spots. Both obser-
vations suggest that the traﬃc patterns in these three areas
are related. These three traﬃc patterns probably depict the
daily routine of working populations, for them rush through
heavy traﬃc area to work in morning and rush back home
in evening.
In the third row of Figure 11, blue line stands for the traf-
ﬁc pattern in comprehensive area, and red line stands for
the average traﬃc pattern of all cell towers. In fact, we ﬁnd
that these two patterns are of great similarity, which sug-
gests that comprehensive area really is a mixture of other
four kinds of functional areas. In conclusion, we analyze the
interrelationships between the traﬃc patterns of diﬀerent
urban functional regions, which provides insightful under-
standing.
5. FREQUENCY-DOMAIN REPRESENTATION
FOR TRAFFIC MODELING
In this section, we conduct frequency-domain analysis.
Such frequency-domain analysis is motivated by observing
the inherent time-domain periodicity of traﬃc and the dis-
advantages of pure time-domain traﬃc analysis, where time-
domain traﬃc identiﬁcation is not easy, especially when cel-
lular towers are deployed in the comprehensive areas with
couples of behaviors. For example, we know that traﬃc of
cellular tower in the oﬃce area reaches the valley in week-
ends, and traﬃc of cellular tower in transport area has two
peaks in one day, but for an arbitrary cellular tower which
has both characteristics, we do not know which of the two
will predominate. On the other hand, in frequency domain,
we can quantify these characteristics by using the ampli-
tude and phase of frequency corresponding to one day and
one week. Thus, we can grasp the key points and compare
the strength of diﬀerent characteristics of traﬃc for one cel-
lular tower, which is not intuitive in time domain. Here, a
natural question to ask is what are the most discriminating
and essential features to present traﬃc patterns of cellular
towers. Motivated by answering this question, we conduc-
t frequency domain analysis on the ﬁve extracted patterns
and reveal several important discoveries.
5.1 Frequency Transform
In order to analyze the strong periodicity existing in time
domain, we ﬁrst carry out discrete fourier transform (DFT)
on the time-domain traﬃc vector X = (x[1], ..., x[N ])T . X
can be either the time-domain traﬃc vector of one cellular
tower, i.e., Xj for cellular tower j, or the aggregate traﬃc
vector of a cluster, i.e., Pj∈C Xj for the cluster C. The
process can be formulated as the following:
N
x[n]e−2πikn/N ,
