Question: "A company's security policy mandates minimizing the use of NTLM authentication due to known vulnerabilities. As a Windows Security Administrator, which policy setting would you first implement to transition towards this mandate, and what subsequent step should you take to ensure minimal disruption to existing systems?"
 "A": "Set the policy to 'Allow all' and then use the 'Audit all' setting to log NTLM authentication requests."
 "B": "Set the policy to 'Audit all' to log NTLM authentication requests, then review the logs to create an exception list."
 "C": "Set the policy to 'Deny all' immediately to force all systems to use more secure protocols like Kerberos."
 "D": "Set the policy to 'Not defined' which is the same as 'Deny all', effectively blocking all NTLM authentication."
Answer: B
