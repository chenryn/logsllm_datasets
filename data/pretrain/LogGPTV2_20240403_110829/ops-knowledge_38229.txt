User: I'm trying to run a task, using celery 3.1, from a custom management command.
If I call my task from a view it works fine but when starting the same task from my management command, the task will only run synchronous in current context (not async via celery).
I don't have djcelery installed.
What do I need to add to my management command to get async task processing on command line?
Assistant: Executing Celery tasks from a command line utility is the same as executing them from views. If you have a task called foo, then in both cases:

Calling foo(...) executes the code of the task as if foo were just a plain Python function.
Calling foo.delay(...) executes the code of the task asynchronously, through a Celery worker.
