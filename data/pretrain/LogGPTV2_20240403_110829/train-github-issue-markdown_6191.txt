Currently if a historical tier has a replication factor of 1 (meaning only 1
copy of the data across the tier) then any particular node cannot be shut down
for planned maintenance without temporarily loosing the ability to query data
which was hosted there.
As a user of Druid, I would like my queries to always return all the data even
during planned maintenance or planned node shutdowns provided there is enough
overall tier capacity to hold the data.
