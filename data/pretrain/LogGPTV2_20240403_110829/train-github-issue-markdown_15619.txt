### Bug summary
Compare the colorbars at the top of the imagegrid in
https://matplotlib.org/3.4.3/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.html and
https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.html (same
example, but mpl3.4 vs 3.5): the ticks have incorrectly moved from the top
side of the colorbar to the bottom side (and the ticklabels are no longer
suppressed by the toggle_label(False) call, but that's more or less a
consequence of the first point, because toggle_label will try to hide the
labels on the cbar_location="top" side).  
This is a regression that bisects to #20054.
### Code for reproduction
    # Run galleries/examples/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.py or galleries/examples/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid2.py
### Actual outcome
https://matplotlib.org/3.5.3/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.html
### Expected outcome
https://matplotlib.org/3.4.3/gallery/axes_grid1/demo_axes_grid.html
### Additional information
Obviously #20054 changed colorbar axes for the (much) better. We can either
try to fix the problematic interaction between new-style colorbars and
ImageGrid, or "advantageously" interpret the fact that no one reported this
bug in the ~1.5y since the release of matplotlib 3.5 as a sign that ImageGrid
sees very little use and perhaps deprecate it (it has a slightly idiosyncratic
API anyways, and may be better replaced by compressed layout these days).
