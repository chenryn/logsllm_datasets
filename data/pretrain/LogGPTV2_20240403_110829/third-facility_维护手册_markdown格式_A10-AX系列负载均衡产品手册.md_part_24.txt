  - **active**: Indicates a device has become the active device.
  - **standby**: Indicates a device has become the standby device.

**Default**: The SNMP service is disabled by default, and all traps are disabled by default.

**Mode**: Configuration mode

**Usage**: For security, SNMP and SNMP traps are disabled on all data interfaces. Use the `enable-management` command to enable SNMP on data interfaces. (See “enable-management” on page 112.)

The `no` form disables traps.

If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the `device-context` command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command. This is only valid for SNMP routing (`snmp-server enable traps routing trap-name`) and network (`snmp-server enable traps network trap-name`) traps.

**Examples**:
- To enable all traps:
  ```plaintext
  ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps
  ```
- To enable all SLB traps:
  ```plaintext
  ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb
  ```
- To enable specific SLB traps:
  ```plaintext
  ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb server-conn-limit
  ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb server-conn-resume
  ```

**Additional SNMP Server Commands**:

- **snmp-server engineID**: Set the SNMPv3 engine ID of this ACOS device.
  ```plaintext
  [no] snmp-server engineID hex-string
  ```

- **snmp-server group**: Configure an SNMP group for SNMPv3.
  ```plaintext
  [no] snmp-server group group-name v3 {auth | noauth | priv} read view-name
  ```

- **snmp-server host**: Configure an SNMP v1/v2c trap receiver.
  ```plaintext
  [no] snmp-server host trap-receiver [version {v1 | v2c | v3}] community-string [udp-port port-num]
  ```

- **snmp-server location**: Configure SNMP location information.
  ```plaintext
  [no] snmp-server location location
  ```

- **snmp-server slb-data-cache-timeout**: Configure the SLB data cache timeout.

**Show Commands**:
- The `show` commands display configuration and system information. In addition to the command options provided with some `show` commands, you can use output modifiers to search and filter the output. See “Searching and Filtering CLI Output” on page 13.
- To automatically re-enter a `show` command at regular intervals, see “repeat” on page 53.
- Note: The `show slb` commands are described in a separate chapter. See “SLB Show Commands” in the Command Line Interface Reference for ADC.
