Usage For security, SNMP and SNMP trap are disabled on all data interfaces. Use the enable-man-
agement command to enable SNMP on data interfaces. (See “enable-management” on
page112.)
The no form disables traps.
If the ACOS device is a member of an aVCS virtual chassis, use the device-context
command to specify the device in the chassis to which to apply this command. This is only
valid for SNMP routing (snmp-server enable traps routing trap-name) and
network (snmp-server enable traps network trap-name) traps.
Example The following command enables all traps:
ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps
Example The following command enables all SLB traps:
ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb
Example The following commands enable SLB traps server-conn-limit and server-conn-resume:
ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb server-conn-limit
ACOS(config)# snmp-server enable traps slb server-conn-resume
