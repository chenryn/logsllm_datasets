**About Me:**
- I run [Irongeek.com](http://irongeek.com).
- My primary interest is in Information Security (InfoSec) education.
- I am a self-proclaimed geek with a lot of free time, and I don't claim to know everything.

### Darknets: Anonymizing Networks

**Definition:**
- Anonymizing networks, also known as "cipherspace," use encryption and proxies (sometimes other peers) to obfuscate who is communicating with whom.
- Examples include Tor and I2P, though there are others like Morphmix, Tarzan, Mixminion, Mixmaster, JAP, MUT, AntsP2P, and Haystack.

**Focus:**
- This discussion will primarily focus on Tor and I2P, but other networks will be mentioned when relevant.
- Terminology and definitions can vary among researchers, and many weaknesses are interrelated.

### Threat Model: Understanding the Risks

**Key Points:**
- You can't protect against everything. Some protocols may be lost causes.
- Users can inadvertently reveal their identity through actions.
- Attacks can either reveal the client/host or reduce the anonymity set.
- Differentiate between active and passive attackers.
- Location matters: internal vs. external adversaries.
- Adversaries vary in power and interest, including nation-states, government agencies, ISPs, and private interest groups (like RIAA/MPAA).

### Tor: Layered Encryption and Directory Servers

**Features:**
- Uses layered encryption and bi-directional tunnels.
- Relies on directory servers.
- Primarily focused on out-proxying to the Internet.
- For more information, visit [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org).

### I2P: Unidirectional Connections and Distributed Hash Table

**Features:**
- Utilizes unidirectional connections (in tunnels and out tunnels).
- Network information is distributed via a distributed hash table (netDB).
- Also uses layered encryption.
- Focuses more on anonymous services.
- For more information, visit [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/).

### Encryption and Communication

**Encryption Methods:**
- EIGamal/SessionTag + AES from A to H.
- Private Key AES from A to D and E to H.
- Diffieâ€“Hellman/Station-To-Station protocol + AES.
- Image source: [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/).

**Garlic Routing:**
- Create a garlic message for multiple destinations, then send it.
- Unpack the message and send individual cloves to their respective destinations.

### Data Anonymity

**Key Point:**
- You are only as anonymous as the data you send.

### Tor-Specific Concerns

**Exit Node Vulnerabilities:**
- Exit nodes can see the traffic, especially if it is not encrypted once it leaves the network.
- Example: Dan Egerstad's "Embassy Hack" and Moxie Marlinspike's SSLStrip.

**Traffic Modification:**
- Attackers can modify traffic and send it back as part of another type of attack.

**Security Best Practices:**
- Use end-to-end encryption.
- Avoid plain-text protocols that send usernames/email addresses in the clear.

### DNS Leaks and Configuration

**DNS Leaks:**
- Ensure all traffic goes through the proxy.
- Misconfigured proxy settings can lead to DNS leaks.
- Snooping can occur via web bugs, which can determine your location.

**Mitigation:**
- Use HTTPS, but be cautious of plugins.
- JavaScript can reduce your anonymity.
- Refer to Gregory Fleischer's DEFCON 17 talk on attacking Tor at the application layer.

### DNS Query Monitoring

**Monitoring:**
- Sniff for traffic leaving your box on port 53 using `port 53` in libPcap.
- In Firefox, set `network.proxy.socks_remote_dns` to `true`.
- Use Torbutton for additional security.
- Other applications may require firewall rules.
- Edit `torrc` to add `DNSPort 53` and `AutomapHostsOnResolve 1`, then set your DNS to `127.0.0.1`.

### Hidden Services and Content

**Content Considerations:**
- Hosting an eepSite may involve non-HTTP content, such as images over HTTPS or bad plugins.
- Cookie sharing can reveal identities.
- Exploits can be sent to hidden servers, potentially compromising them.

### P2P and Tor

**P2P Traffic:**
- If Tor is used only for contacting the tracker, IP addresses can be revealed through announce messages and extension protocol handshakes.
- Refer to the paper by Pere Manils et al. for more information on P2P information leakage.

### Client and Server Security

**Client-Side:**
- Ensure your browser sends all traffic through the darknet.
- Use firewall rules and limit plugins.
- Use a separate browser and check against [Decloak.net](http://decloak.net/) and [Panopticlick](http://panopticlick.eff.org/).

**Server-Side:**
- Patch your systems.
- Do not run hidden services on a box that routes to the Internet.

### Network-Level Attacks

**Types of Attacks:**
- Starvation attacks
- Partition attacks
- Flooding
- Standard DDoS attacks
- Shared infrastructure vulnerabilities

**Internet Blocking:**
- China blocked access to Tor's core directory servers in 2009.
- Other countries like Egypt, Libya, and Iran have also blocked Internet access.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Bridge Nodes and Distributed Infrastructure:**
- Use bridge nodes (Tor) and distributed infrastructure (I2P).
- Protocol obfuscation can help.
- Total or severe blocking requires more advanced countermeasures.
