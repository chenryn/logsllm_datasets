charges in proportion to the volume of trafﬁc traversing a link. This
allows us to understand trends in the balance between revenue- and
cost-generating ﬂows for the ASes in our dataset (Sec. 6.3).
Finally, we conduct case studies of the economic impact of
BitTorrent on several ISPs using the 95th-percentile charging
model (Sec. 6.4), in which the temporal pattern of trafﬁc – not
just the overall volume – plays a signiﬁcant role in determining
cost [23]. This burstable billing model is generally considered the
most popular model used between small, access networks and their
providers [9]. We have shown (Sec. 5) that a signiﬁcant fraction
of BitTorrent trafﬁc is handled by small transit providers near the
edge of the network and that this trafﬁc is increasingly exhibiting
strong diurnal usage patterns (Sec. 4). While we cannot assign
dollar values to 95th-percentile trafﬁc, we can determine whether
BitTorrent is relatively more expensive than the rest of the trafﬁc
traversing each link.
6.2 Portion of Charging Trafﬁc
In this section, we analyze BitTorrent trafﬁc in terms of the types
of links that it traverses. To begin, we ﬁnd that 8% of all trafﬁc in
our dataset stayed in the same AS. Though this may seem to be
a small number, one should consider that peers in our dataset are
distributed across nearly 16,000 ASes. For these ﬂows, we assume
that there are no transit charges and we exclude them from the
remainder of our analysis.
We focus then on interdomain trafﬁc and compute the portion of
each AS’s total BitTorrent trafﬁc that crosses links to its customers,
to its providers, and to its peers. This allows us to understand the
portion of BitTorrent trafﬁc that traverses charging links and thus
contributes to ISPs’ costs.
We begin by describing summary results for tier-1 trafﬁc (not
shown). Not surprisingly, none of this trafﬁc ﬂows to a provider
(by deﬁnition), but interestingly the tier-1 ASes experience sig-
niﬁcantly more peering trafﬁc relative to customer trafﬁc. The
implication is that even when traversing tier-1 networks, BitTorrent
ﬂows are relatively unlikely to incur variable charges.
For trafﬁc in tiers 2, 3 and 4, Fig. 12 plots a CDF of the
proportion of per-AS interdomain trafﬁc grouped by business
relationship.
In tier-2 networks (Fig. 12a), the vast majority of
trafﬁc crosses no-cost peering links, while a small portion of the
trafﬁc crosses charging links. In the median case, over 95% of tier-
2 trafﬁc crosses no-cost links. We also note that, on average, more
of their non-peering trafﬁc traverses customer links than provider
links.
For tier-3 ASes (Fig. 12b), we again ﬁnd that signiﬁcantly more
trafﬁc crosses peering links than provider or customer links; 25% of
these ASes send the majority of BitTorrent trafﬁc to provider links.
Unlike with tier 2, provider trafﬁc is much larger than customer
trafﬁc for tier 3, indicating that these ISPs on average are paying for
rather than proﬁting from transit charges due to BitTorrent trafﬁc.
Last, we analyze trafﬁc distributions for tier-4 networks (see
Fig. 12c). As expected, only a small fraction of these ASes have
any customer trafﬁc, so BitTorrent does not generate substantial
revenue here. We also see that most tier-4 networks are connected
either over peering or provider links. For half of tier-4 networks,
the majority of BitTorrent trafﬁc is handled by provider links,
suggesting that BitTorrent is incurring signiﬁcant transit charges
for these networks.
6.3 Trafﬁc Ratios
While the previous graphs indicate the portion of trafﬁc along
links for different business relationships, they do not allow straight-
forward calculations of the relative amounts of customer and
provider trafﬁc for each AS (and thus which direction of charging
trafﬁc dominates). Figure 13 plots CDFs of these ratios for each
tier, except for tier 1 where the denominator would be zero.
Values greater than one indicate cases where an AS receives more
customer trafﬁc than it sends to providers (presumably generating
a net revenue). Overall, this is always the case for tier-2 ASes.
For lower tiers we ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant fraction of them do not
have any customer trafﬁc, resulting in a ratio of 0. The ratio is
less than one most of the time, indicating that BitTorrent trafﬁc is
costing these networks – only 17% of tier-3 and 15% of tier-4 ASes

on customer and provider AS links. More customer trafﬁc
than provider trafﬁc (a ratio > 1) indicates a net revenue (if
provider and customer trafﬁc have the same cost). This shows
the proportion of ASes in each tier that have a net revenue.

with customer trafﬁc have a ratio > 1. While this may seem to
indicate that BitTorrent is harmful to lower-tier ASes, it is difﬁcult
to determine the relative cost of BitTorrent without understanding
the volumes of non-BitTorrent trafﬁc over the same links (an issue
we address in Sec. 6.4).
The ratios above indicate when there is a net imbalance in
charged trafﬁc volumes but do not show their relative size com-
pared to all BitTorrent trafﬁc, including those ﬂowing over no-cost
links. We now address this by computing the average revenue (or
cost) per byte for each AS (Fig. 14). This is deﬁned as the balance
of charging trafﬁc (customer bytes minus provider bytes) divided
by the total number of bytes ﬂowing through the AS. When peering
trafﬁc accounts for a large proportion of AS trafﬁc, the revenue of
each byte of P2P trafﬁc will be close to zero. However, when most
AS trafﬁc is from providers (or customers), it will have a more
signiﬁcant cost (or revenue) per byte for ﬂows that travel through
its network.
In Figure 14, all tier-1 ASes have a net revenue (values > 0)
because, by deﬁnition, they do not have any provider links.
In
addition, all tier-2 ASes have a net revenue as well, reﬂecting
the fact that the majority of their trafﬁc is on peering, customer,
or sibling links. The ASes in tiers 3 and 4 have incrementally
larger average costs per byte overall, corresponding to the larger
proportions of trafﬁc traversing their provider links.
While most tier-4 ASes do not generate revenue from BitTorrent
trafﬁc, there are a few exceptions. This is explained by the fact that
the tier classiﬁcation algorithm is not strictly hierarchical, so a tier-
4 AS can be a provider for another AS. In this case, large portions
of trafﬁc can traverse this revenue-generating link, resulting in a net
proﬁt per byte in the graph.
Finally, we attempt to quantify the relative scales of these costs
and/or revenues by calculating a basic “balance sheet” for each
AS in our study. In Fig. 15, we report customer minus provider
trafﬁc for each AS in tiers 2–4. Since tier-1 ASes do not have any
providers, they have large net balances, several orders of magnitude
larger than the net balances shown here. The balances of tier-2
networks range from 12 GB to 13 TB. By comparison, we see that
the net differences from tier-3 and tier-4 ISPs are relatively small.
Although tier-4 ASes had the largest average cost per byte of P2P
trafﬁc, we see that they have relatively small net balances of trafﬁc
compared to ASes in all other tiers.
Figure 15: For each AS in Tier T , the difference between
customer trafﬁc and provider trafﬁc. In contrast to the data
in Figures 13 and 14, this perspective allows us to compare the
scale of the revenue or expenses of ASes by tier.
6.4 Impact on 95th-Percentile Transit Costs
We now examine the cost of BitTorrent trafﬁc under a 95th-
percentile charging model, with a goal of understanding the impact
of temporal trends in BitTorrent trafﬁc on ISPs’ costs. This is
important because BitTorrent and network trafﬁc are not uniform
across time (e.g.
due to diurnal trends), and costs computed
under a 95th-percentile charging model are essentially set by usage
in the busiest hours for network usage, typically in the evening.
Intuitively,
if BitTorrent trafﬁc is more prevalent during these
peak hours than off-peak hours, then we say it is relatively more
expensive for the ISP, in comparison to the rest of the trafﬁc.
Appendix A provides a detailed description of the 95th-percentile
charging model and the Shapley analysis that we use to determine
the relative cost of BitTorrent trafﬁc.
For this analysis, we obtain traces of total link volume between
a major transit ISP “T ” and several of its providers (A, B) and
customers (C-G).2 In addition, we compute for each pair of ASes
the time series of BitTorrent trafﬁc seen in our dataset. For both
data sets, we use 5-minute intervals, a resolution commonly used
in determining 95th-percentile charges. Both sets of traces are
from the same 1-week period, January 6-14, 2011, and thereby

are comparable and capture both weekday and weekend trafﬁc
patterns.
Following the typical use of 95th-percentile billing, we focus on
the link direction with the greater 95th-percentile trafﬁc volume.
For ISP T ’s providers, this is the inbound direction (toward ISP T );
for its customers, the dominant direction is outbound (from ISP T ).
6.4.1 “Relative Cost” Metric and Scaling
For each type of trafﬁc that we study – BitTorrent and “all the
rest” – we compute that trafﬁc’s “relative cost”. This is deﬁned
as the ratio between its Shapley value (how much it costs) and
its overall fraction of trafﬁc on the link. For example, if our
BitTorrent trace accounts for 10% of all trafﬁc seen over a link, but
the Shapley value is 20% (e.g. if trafﬁc occurs during peak hours),
then BitTorrent trafﬁc’s “relative cost” is 2. Therefore, BitTorrent is
contributing more to deﬁning the 95th-percentile transit costs than
the rest of the trafﬁc. Using this metric, we can evaluate the relative
contribution of any subset of network trafﬁc over a link.
Though we have detailed BitTorrent traces for the networks we
study in this section, it is important to note that there is no ground
truth information to determine the relative volume of BitTorrent
trafﬁc compared to “all the rest” of trafﬁc for the links that we
study. To address this issue, we assume that our BitTorrent sample
is representative of the larger population of all BitTorrent trafﬁc on
the network (following from our analysis in Sec. 3.2). This allows
us to assess the relative cost of any BitTorrent trafﬁc ratio by scaling
our time-series of BitTorrent trafﬁc to the corresponding fraction of
overall link trafﬁc.
Using the BitTorrent trafﬁc ratio as a free variable, we scale each
value in our time-series of BitTorrent trafﬁc by a factor such that
the sum of BitTorrent bandwidth matches a given percentage of
the total aggregate link volume over the week. Then, we examine
the impact of different fractions of BitTorrent trafﬁc over a link on
BitTorrent’s role in setting the 95th-percentile costs.
6.4.2 Relative Impact of BitTorrent on
95th-Percentile Costs
We evaluate now the relative cost of BitTorrent trafﬁc over
several links between a large transit provider and several of its
customers and providers.
First, we examine the trends in the relative cost of BitTorrent
trafﬁc as we vary the percentage of BitTorrent trafﬁc (X%) out
of the total trafﬁc on the link. To compute the relative cost for
each X, we subtract the BitTorrent trace from the total trace to
obtain the time-series of “all the rest” of the trafﬁc and run the
analysis described in Appendix A. A relative cost of 1 means that
the Shapley value is the same as the fraction of trafﬁc – BitTorrent
trafﬁc costs the same as other trafﬁc, in terms of setting the ISP’s

variation (“C.V.”) of the time series of BitTorrent trafﬁc.

BitTorrent is scaled to 10% of total trafﬁc). Increased variation
