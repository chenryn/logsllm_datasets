Question: "When designing a secure communication strategy for a mobile application, why would a security engineer prefer using TLS v1.2 or v1.3 over TLS v1.0 and v1.1?"
 "A": "TLS v1.2 and v1.3 provide faster communication speeds, making them suitable for high-traffic applications."
 "B": "TLS v1.0 and v1.1 have known vulnerabilities and their usage is deprecated, making TLS v1.2 and v1.3 more secure options."
 "C": "TLS v1.2 and v1.3 are the only versions that support all block ciphers and integrity check algorithms."
 "D": "TLS v1.0 and v1.1 are not supported by any mobile operating systems, rendering them obsolete."
Answer: B
