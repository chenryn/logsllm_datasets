Hello, I ran into a bug related to typealias while working in Graphs.jl today.  
Here's the code:
    typealias A{B} Vector{Vector{B}}
    typealias C{D} Vector{Vector{D}}
Then `A` gives `Array{Array{B,1},1}` as expected.  
Unfortunately `C` also gives `Array{Array{B,1},1}`
So `A{Int}` is `Array{Array{Int64,1},1}`  
But `C{Int}` is `Array{Array{B,1},1}`
This has bad effects. If I put `typealias LLT{T} Vector{Vector{T}}` at the top
of Graphs/test/test_all, before the library is loaded, it breaks everything.
