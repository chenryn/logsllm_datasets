User: I'm trying to setup a Python application that should automatically start when Linux boots. It should also start (unless not already running) if the computer resumes from standby mode - which is mainly the problem. 
Does anybody know where to integrate these requirements?
Thanks,
Marius
Assistant: Configure a cron job every minute to detect if application running - if not start.
