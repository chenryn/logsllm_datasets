### Description of the New Feature/Enhancement

While using Windows Terminal, I was simultaneously installing Node.js. After the installation, I attempted to check the Node.js version by running `node --version` in the current terminal session. However, the command failed because the terminal's environment path had not been updated to include the newly installed Node.js.

I then opened a new PowerShell tab within the same Windows Terminal instance and ran `node --version` again, but the command still failed. It was only after closing and reopening Windows Terminal that the command worked correctly.

**Suggested Enhancement:**
When adding a new tab in Windows Terminal, it should automatically update the environment path to reflect any recent changes. This would ensure that newly installed software, such as Node.js, is immediately accessible without needing to restart the terminal.
