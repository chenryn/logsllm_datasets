# Description of the new feature/enhancement
I had the windows terminal open.  
I was installing node at the same time.  
After installation I tried `node --version` it couldn't find it, because the
current window terminal session path didn't have node in it.
I added a new Powershell tab, and I found it too failed, when I entered `node
--version`. I had to close Windows Terminal and open it again for it to work
Perhaps when you add a new tab, it should grab the latest path?
