**Table 10 Summary:**
Our study reveals that Ethereum DApps attacks are prevalent, compromising various types of DApps through different attack vectors. We found that 57.3% of the victim DApps fall into the Gambling category. These DApps often require random number generation, which can be implemented using a weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG), making them vulnerable to bad randomness attacks. Notably, 82% of the DApps scanned by DEFIER were observed under attack, likely due to their popularity and large balances, making them attractive targets for malicious actors. Among the 85 victim DApps identified in the exploit transactions, 75 (e.g., SpaceWar and SuperCard) had not been previously reported.

**Economic Impact:**
To understand the financial impact of these abusive activities, we estimated the financial loss for each victim DApp by calculating the income and cost differences of the exploit transactions. Table 12 shows the top 5 DApps with the largest losses, with a total estimated loss of 28,485 Ethers.

**Attack Stages:**
Table 11 provides the number of DApps found in each attack stage. Our model identified 214,408 attack preparation transactions associated with 80 DApps. We found that 507 functions were tested by adversaries, and 311 of these functions were exploited during the exploitation stage. This indicates that our model can help identify vulnerable functions before they are exploited.

### Discussion

**Mitigation Strategies:**
Based on our measurement study, we have identified several effective mitigation strategies to control the growing Ethereum DApp attacks. In our study, we observed multiple stakeholders (e.g., exploit developers and money managers) in the Ethereum DApp criminal ecosystem. Identifying and monitoring or restricting these upstream criminal roles could prevent attacks at an early stage.

For DApp owners, detecting exploit attempts at the preparation stage and tracking similar DApp exploits can prevent propagation attacks. DEFIER identifies each stage of the kill chain independently, making it useful for investigating attack preparations. Additionally, 62% of the functions tested by attackers at the preparation stage were later exploited. Identifying these functions can help DApp owners locate vulnerabilities. Our study also highlights the prevalence of attack propagation, where attackers reuse exploits on similar DApps. Therefore, DApp owners can use DEFIER to monitor and take action before attacks occur.

**Limitations of DEFIER:**
DEFIER's design is limited by the information it uses: historical transactions and their execution traces. While these transactions provide valuable data, they may miss attack operations that do not generate transactions, such as local invocations (e.g., eth_call) or calling constant functions. Although these operations are rarely exploited, our vantage point might miss some attack cases. Future research will address this issue.

As a supervised learning model, DEFIER requires a training set labeled by its attack lifecycle. Data annotation can be time-consuming, but the high-level and relatively stable attack intents captured in the training set can be used until those criminal intents change. DEFIER is based on high-level threat intelligence, making it robust to small adjustments in attack activities. However, it may not identify attacks that do not exhibit typical intent or involve single, low-profit exploit transactions. Nonetheless, DEFIER raises the bar for DApp attacks, making them more costly, especially for large-scale profit-driven adversaries.

**Other Blockchain Platforms:**
While our current design focuses on Ethereum DApps due to their popularity, similar criminal operations can be found on other blockchain platforms (e.g., EOS). A small-scale study on EOS DApps (e.g., EOS.WIN, EOSCast, and EOSRoyale) revealed a similar attack lifecycle and patterns from EOS transactions and their execution traces.

### Related Work

**Ethereum DApp Security:**
The security of Ethereum DApps has gained increasing attention from researchers. Studies include vulnerability assessments, real-world DApp attacks, and frauds. For example, Chen et al. [16] studied Ponzi scheme DApps and developed a machine learning-based detection tool. Torres et al. [46] investigated honeypot DApps, introducing a methodology for automated detection. Chen et al. [15] identified abnormal EOAs using a threshold-based method. Atzei et al. [10] provided a survey on real-world attacks against Ethereum smart contracts, focusing on vulnerability assessment. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to study the cybercriminal ecosystem, including the attack lifecycle, infrastructure, and campaign organization, leveraging Ethereum's open and immutable transaction records.

**Security Event Detection and Forensic Analysis:**
DEFIER addresses intrusion detection and forensic analysis, specifically for Ethereum DApp attacks. Many studies [21, 38, 43] have explored security event detection and forecasting in various domains. Recent trends focus on understanding high-level event semantics for more efficient and effective detection. Ben-Asher et al. [12] evaluated the effectiveness of contextual knowledge in detecting cyber-attacks. Ma et al. [31] proposed a semantics-aware program annotation for partitioning execution based on high-level task structures. Shen et al. [44] used temporal word embedding to cluster security events and track their evolution. Hassan et al. [26] introduced a threat alert triage system featuring historical and contextual information. The closest work to ours is HOLMES [35], a real-time APT detection system. Unlike previous works, our study utilizes Ethereum transaction time series analysis and graph sequence mining to learn high-level attack operational intents, allowing us to detect both known and unknown attacks accurately.

### Conclusion

In this paper, we report our study on Ethereum DApp attack incidents, which reveal a sophisticated hierarchical structure, multiple criminal roles, and various attack behaviors. We performed the first measurement study and forensic analysis on real-world DApp attacks, leveraging Ethereum's open and immutable transaction records. Our methodology supplements missing attack information in DApp incident reports. Using comprehensive attack transactions and their execution traces, we conducted an empirical study to recover end-to-end footprints, kill chains, and attack patterns. Our DApp investigation tool, DEFIER, successfully identified 476,342 exploit transactions on 85 victim DApps, which had never been reported before. This work sheds light on the potential to utilize threat intelligence to automatically investigate DApps on a large scale, helping to defend against this emerging threat more effectively.
