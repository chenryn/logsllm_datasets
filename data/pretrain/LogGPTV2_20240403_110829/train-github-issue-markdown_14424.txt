### Issue Description
I have thoroughly searched the issues in this repository and believe that this is not a duplicate.

### Expected Behavior
The `next@latest` package should be added without any incorrect peer dependency warnings.

### Current Behavior
When I run the following command:
```sh
yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
```
I encounter the following output:
```sh
yarn add v1.2.0
info No lockfile found.
[1/4] Resolving packages...
warning next > glob-promise > semantic-release > npmconf@2.1.2: This package has been reintegrated into npm and is now out of date with respect to npm.
warning next > glob-promise > semantic-release > @semantic-release/condition-travis > travis-deploy-once > travis-ci > request > node-uuid@1.4.8: Use the uuid module instead.
[2/4] Fetching packages...
info fsevents@1.1.2: The platform "win32" is incompatible with this module.
info "fsevents@1.1.2" is an optional dependency and failed compatibility check. Excluding it from installation.
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
warning "styled-jsx@2.0.2" has an incorrect peer dependency "react@15.x.x".
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
success Saved 618 new dependencies.
```

Running `yarn check` results in:
```sh
yarn check v1.2.0
error "next#styled-jsx#react@15.x.x" does not satisfy the found match of "react@16.0.0".
error Found 1 error.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/check for documentation about this command.
```

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Run the following command on a Windows 7 laptop:
   ```sh
   yarn add react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
   ```
2. After adding, run:
   ```sh
   yarn check
   ```

### Context
I am currently developing an application using Next.js version 3 and React version 15 with Styled-JSX. I am now trying to upgrade to Next.js version 4 and use React version 16 with Styled-JSX version 2. I am unsure if this issue is related to Yarn or the packages themselves.

### Environment
| Technology | Version |
|------------|---------|
| next       | 4.0.3   |
| node       | 8.1.2   |
| OS         | Windows 7 |
| Browser    | N/A     |
