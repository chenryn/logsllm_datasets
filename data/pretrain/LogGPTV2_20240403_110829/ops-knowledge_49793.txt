User: I wanted to get your opinions on the merits of different AMQP implementations to be used with celery. I am looking particularly at message prioritization and job queue sizes. 
What are your thoughts?
Assistant: After reading some docs and trying out a few options, I have found that RabbitMQ suffices for most purposes.
