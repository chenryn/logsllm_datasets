User: I have opened Anaconda - then i maneuvered to the directory where a certain python program i want to run actually lies. 
I then tried the %run  command.
But the command does not seem to work!
So how am i to run that program?
Does anyone know the right command that one has to use in the black colored Anaconda console command line, to run a Python program existing in a certain directory (to which the command line has been taken to)
Assistant: %run is a command that's run from inside of IPython. To use it, you should start ipython first. Or just run python program.py (if your program is named program.py).
