I understand that you are considering a transition from Windows to Linux and are looking for examples of design patterns in the Linux environment. Your application is a classic client-server setup with detailed forms for each business entity. It will handle user input, perform validation checks, execute some calculations, and save data to a database. Additionally, it will provide summary lists of entities and allow searches among these entities, with the ability to open detailed forms by clicking on items in the lists.

### GUI Frameworks for Python and Ruby

For building a desktop application with a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python or Ruby, here are some popular frameworks:

- **Python:**
  - **Tkinter:** A standard Python library for creating simple GUI applications.
  - **PyQt/PySide:** More powerful and flexible, suitable for complex applications.
  - **Kivy:** Good for touch-based and multi-platform applications.
  - **wxPython:** Another robust option for creating cross-platform applications.

- **Ruby:**
  - **Shoes:** A simple and easy-to-use GUI toolkit.
  - **Ruby/GTK3:** A Ruby binding for the GTK+ library, which is more powerful but has a steeper learning curve.
  - **FXRuby (Fox Toolkit):** A Ruby binding for the Fox GUI toolkit, suitable for cross-platform applications.

### Design Patterns

Design patterns are independent of the programming language and operating system. They are best practices and solutions to common problems in software design. Here are some patterns that might be relevant for your application:

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):**
  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
  - **View:** Handles the display of data.
  - **Controller:** Manages user input and updates the model and view accordingly.
  - **Use Case:** Suitable for applications with a clear separation between the data, presentation, and control logic.

- **MVP (Model-View-Presenter):**
  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
  - **View:** Passes user input to the presenter and displays the output.
  - **Presenter:** Acts as an intermediary between the model and view, handling the logic and updating the view.
  - **Use Case:** Useful when you need to test the view and business logic separately.

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**
  - **Model:** Manages the data and business logic.
  - **View:** Displays the data.
  - **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the model and view, providing data bindings and commands.
  - **Use Case:** Commonly used in modern UI frameworks with data binding, such as WPF and Xamarin.

### Recommendations

- **For a Classic Client-Server Application:**
  - **MVC** is a good starting point due to its clear separation of concerns and wide adoption in desktop applications.
  - **MVP** can also be a good choice if you need more control over the presentation layer and want to make your application more testable.

- **Avoiding Web Development:**
  - If you prefer to avoid web development, focus on desktop GUI frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or Shoes, depending on whether you choose Python or Ruby.

### Conclusion

Choose a GUI framework that fits your needs and experience level. For design patterns, MVC is a solid choice for a classic client-server application. MVP and MVVM are also viable options depending on your specific requirements and preferences. The key is to select a pattern that aligns well with your application's architecture and your team's familiarity with the pattern.
