User: I am investigating a switch from windows to linux and i struggle to find samples of design patterns applied in this world.
The application is a classic client server with detailed forms for each business entity.
It will be taking user input, do some validation checks, a few calculations, and save them to database.
It will also have lists summarizing entities, and searches among these entities.
A click to one item of these lists will open the detailled forms.
If i use python or ruby, what should i use for GUI ?
And what pattern : is MVC, MVVM or MVP any good ?
Or is there anything better ?  
Note : I have never done web developpement, and i would like to avoid to have to learn both linux and web developpement at the same time.
Assistant: Design (or architectural) patterns have nothing to do with the target programming language or operating system. Ook at you problem, if you can see you requirements which will be fulfilled by some solution provided by a pattern and the consequences will be good, jsut use the pattern. If you aks MVC, MVP, MVVM etc. look at those patterns and problems they solve and if it is what you need for you application, use them.
