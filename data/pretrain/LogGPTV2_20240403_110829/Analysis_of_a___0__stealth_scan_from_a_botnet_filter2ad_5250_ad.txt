(“C”). The same regions are visible in Figure 13(b), where we use
the Hilbert-curve map to highlight the overlap in targets: IP ad-
dresses (in reverse-byte order) that were probed more than once are
depicted in white.
Table 2 shows statistics calculated separately for the three phases
of the scan. The correlation between coverage and overlap of the
scan is evident, and is consistent with a probabilistic mechanism in
the choice of the targets that can be conﬁgured by the botmaster
to trade off completeness and redundancy of scanning. The ﬁnd-
ing illustrated in Figure 14 further substantiates the hypothesis that
the three phases correspond to different conﬁgurations of the scan.
The ﬁgure shows, for each phase, the distribution of the number of
packets sent in each “reverse /16 subnet” (we deﬁne a reverse /16
subnet as the set of all possible IP addresses obtainable when the
least two signiﬁcant bytes are ﬁxed). The three curves refer to pop-
ulations of different size, which explains the different smoothness
of their shapes (e.g., phase C is considerably longer thus covering
a larger number of reverse /16 subnets). However, all of them are
highly centered around a different value (average values are 395.6

consistent and distinctive behavior in each phase.
Figure 14: Consistent and distinctive behavior of the different phases of the
scan. The curves represent, for each phase A, B, C, the distributions of pack-
ets observed at the UCSD Network Telescope in each “reverse /16 subnet”.
The distributions are all centered around different values and mostly non
overlapping.
Finally, in both Figures 13(a) and 13(b), we also observe bet-
ter coverage and larger overlap in the transition from one region
to the other, suggesting that the botmaster re-issued a command to
scan those IP ranges to the bots after changing the conﬁguration
parameter (possibly because the scan was stopped without collect-
ing the results of the previous command). The higher coverage in
these transition areas provides further evidence of a probabilistic
approach in the choice of the target IPs (probably happening at the
level of the single bots): re-issuing the commands for that range of
target IPs results in a partially different set of probed targets.
Even given non-negligible redundancy, an average of 1.39 bots
hitting the same target is small compared to the large number of
bots involved. Such low redundancy is novel, or at least undocu-
mented in the literature, which has mostly reported on bots that
independently scan the same address range in a random uniform
fashion [12,39]. The small overlap and thus high efﬁciency in terms
of completeness vs. redundancy achieved by this botnet is an im-
pressive consequence of strongly orchestrated behavior.
4.3.2 Adaptivity
The strong coordination of bot activity is also visible in terms
of adaptation capabilities. Starting around 7 February 00:00 GMT
through around 11 February 12:00 GMT, the scan proceeds very
slowly, with only a few active bots (Figure 2). A possible hypoth-
esis is that most of the C&C channels are down during this pe-
riod. However, we observe that the target IP ranges that would have
normally been assigned to these C&C channels were automatically
redirected to those channels that were still up.
Figure 15 illustrates this behavior. Dashed lines in the graph rep-
resent the probing rate per hour of the three bots discussed in Sec-
tion 3.4. During this period the bots do not change their speed, sug-
gesting that the C&C channel they refer to has not changed its char-
acteristics in terms of numbers of bots managed, etc. (i.e., the num-
ber of bots competing for a certain C&C channel does not change,
therefore the rate at which each bot gets assigned a new “reverse”
/24 stays the same). However, over this same time interval we ob-
serve a signiﬁcant change in the sequences of IP ranges assigned
to these bots. The continuous lines in Figure 15 show, for each of
the three bots, the distance between subsequent target IPs, calcu-
lated by subtracting the target IPs after reversing their byte order
and converting them into 32-bit numbers. The graph shows a drop
of about one order of magnitude in the distance, meaning that the

nels. Dashed lines represent probes per hour (PPH) carried out by 3 different
bots. Their speed did not change signiﬁcantly on 7 February but the global
speed of the scan decreased considerably, probably because some C&C
channels went off-line. However, the target IP ranges assigned to these bots
became denser during this period, to compensate for the absence of other
C&C channels: continuous lines represent the distance between subsequent
target IPs of each respective bot, showing an order of magnitude decrease
in that time interval.
corresponding C&C channel(s) receive a “denser” list of targets to
compensate for the disappearance of the other C&C channels.
4.4 Botnet characteristics
Observing a horizontal scan of this magnitude from such a large
darknet allows unique insight into the characteristics of the botnet
that performed it. The size of the darknet, combined with the re-
verse IP sequential ordering of the targets, allowed the telescope
to capture probes across the entire life of the scan, providing an
unprecedented view of the population of the Sality botnet.
A white paper from Symantec [23] estimated the size of the Sal-
ity botnet at approximately a million bots, by measuring the num-
ber of hosts that a ‘rogue’ server under their control communicated
with. We identiﬁed a total of 2,954,108 unique source IPs for bots
that participated in the sipscan. As the authors of [59] demonstrate,
it is difﬁcult to accurately determine the size of the botnet popula-
tion when using source IP addresses collected from trafﬁc sent by
infected hosts. This difﬁculty arises due to the effects of dynamic
IP address assignment (DHCP), which can result in several IP ad-
dresses being used by a single bot (especially over a 12-day inter-
val), and NAT, which can cause multiple bots to appear as a single
IP. However, Figure 11 shows continuous growth in the number of
unique /24 networks hosting bots over the entire duration of the
scan. This diversity of /24 networks can be used as an approxima-
tion for the number of new bots that arrive over the course of the
scan.
We leverage the large population of source addresses observed
to further understand how hosts compromised by botnets are dis-
tributed globally. To this end, we determine the Autonomous Sys-
tem Number (ASN) for each bot using a Routeviews BGP routing
snapshot [60] taken on Monday 14 February 2011 at 12:00 UTC,
proximate to the scanning episode. Using this table, we perform
longest-preﬁx matching to resolve each source IP to its origin AS.
The ASes enumerated in Table 3 are the 10 most common across
the bots used by the sipscan botmaster. We also list the AS name
and home country extracted from whois data. Similar to the Con-
ﬁcker [55] and Mega-D [4] botnets, we see a dominant AS at the
top of the list (TTNet), which alone accounts for over 10% all par-
ticipating bots, followed by a long tail of small ASes. However,
