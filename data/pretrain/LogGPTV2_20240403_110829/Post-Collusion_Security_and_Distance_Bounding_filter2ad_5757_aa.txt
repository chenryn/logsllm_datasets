## Abstract
The verification of cryptographic protocols typically assumes that participants have not revealed their long-term keys. However, in some scenarios, participants might collude to undermine security goals without disclosing their long-term secrets. We introduce a model based on multiset rewriting to reason about collusion in security protocols and define the concept of post-collusion security, which ensures the validity of security properties in sessions initiated after collusion. This notion is applied to analyze terrorist fraud in distance-bounding protocols, where agents collude to falsely prove proximity, but no further false proximity proofs can be issued without additional collusion.

Our definitions and the Tamarin prover are used to develop a modular framework for verifying distance-bounding protocols, accounting for all known attack types. We conduct a survey of over 25 protocols, including industrial standards such as Mastercard’s PayPass and NXP’s MIFARE Plus with proximity check. For these industrial protocols, we confirm existing attacks, propose fixes, and provide computer-verifiable security proofs for the repaired versions.

## 1. Introduction
Communication protocols are designed to achieve specific security goals, such as authentication or confidentiality, even in the presence of an adversary. The Dolev-Yao adversary model [30] is a widely accepted standard, where the adversary can intercept, block, modify, or inject messages. Additionally, the adversary can compromise protocol participants, gaining full control over them for the entire protocol execution.

While the Dolev-Yao model is sufficient for capturing non-trivial attacks, it assumes that agents are either honest or compromised. This binary classification does not account for more nuanced behaviors, such as covert adversaries who cheat only if they remain undetected. For example, in an online gaming platform, players might secretly collaborate to cheat while avoiding detection.

In this paper, we refine the Dolev-Yao model to capture collusion, where agents deviate from the protocol specification without being controlled by the adversary. We introduce the notion of post-collusion security, which ensures the validity of security claims in sessions initiated after collusion. This allows potential colluding agents to weigh the benefits of collusion against the potential collateral effects.

A related concept is post-compromise security [23], which examines the impact of compromise actions on future protocol sessions. Unlike post-compromise security, where the adversary controls the compromise, collusion is a deliberate choice made by the agents themselves. Our notion of post-collusion security finds a direct application in distance-bounding protocols, which aim to ensure physical proximity. These protocols are used in RFID and NFC technologies, and our approach allows us to formally analyze terrorist fraud, where agents collude to falsely prove proximity for one protocol run, but cannot issue further false proofs without additional collusion.

### Contributions
- **Formal Model for Collusion**: We provide a formal symbolic model based on multiset rewriting systems to capture collusion in security protocols.
- **Post-Collusion Security**: We introduce the notion of post-collusion security, which ensures the validity of security claims in sessions initiated after collusion. This notion can be easily implemented in protocol verification tools like Tamarin.
- **Terrorist Fraud Analysis**: We use post-collusion security to formally describe and analyze terrorist fraud in distance-bounding protocols. We develop a Tamarin-based framework for verifying these protocols, accounting for all known attack types.
- **Security Survey and Fixes**: We conduct a security survey of over 25 protocols, including industrial standards based on ISO/IEC 14443. We propose and verify fixes for the vulnerabilities found in these protocols.

## 2. Related Work
We discuss works that extend the Dolev-Yao adversary model and focus on symbolic verification frameworks for distance-bounding protocols.

### Alternative Adversary Models
- **Basin and Cremers [10]**: Proposed extensions to the Dolev-Yao adversary, identifying new attack vectors in key-exchange protocols.
- **Human Misbehavior [12]**: Provided a formalism to model and reason about human errors using the Tamarin tool.
- **Post-Compromise Security [23]**: Defined as an agent’s security guarantees after their peer has been compromised. It focuses on stateful protocols like authenticated key-exchange (AKE) and messaging protocols. Our post-collusion security is similar but applies to a broader range of protocols and uses a symbolic approach.

### Distance-Bounding Protocols
- **Basin et al. [8, 54]**: Proposed a tool-supported framework for symbolic verification of secure distance-bounding, restricting Dolev-Yao capabilities to include location information.
- **Mauw et al. [44]**: Introduced a verification framework that analyzes co-location via causal ordering, reducing code complexity and improving automation. Both frameworks allow for the discovery of traditional attacks but do not account for terrorist fraud, where non-compromised agents behave as specified.

By refining the Dolev-Yao model to include collusion and introducing post-collusion security, we address a significant gap in the analysis of security protocols, particularly in the context of distance-bounding and terrorist fraud.
