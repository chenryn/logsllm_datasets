Abstract. Recent researches have stated the fast deployment of IPv6.
It has been demonstrated that IPv6 grows much faster, being so more
and more adopted by both Internet service providers but also by servers
and end-hosts. In parallel, researches have been conducted to discover
and assess the usage of MPLS tunnels. Indeed, recent developments in
the ICMP protocol make certain categories of MPLS tunnels transparent
to traceroute probing. However, these studies focus only on IPv4, where
MPLS is strongly deployed.
In this paper, we provide a ﬁrst look at how MPLS is used under IPv6
networks using traceroute data collected by CAIDA. At ﬁrst glance,
we observe that the MPLS deployment and usage seem to greatly diﬀer
between IPv4 and IPv6, in particular in the way MPLS label stacks are
used. While label stacks with at least two labels are marginal in IPv4 (and
mostly correspond to a VPN usage), they are prevalent in IPv6. After a
deeper analysis of the label stack typical content in IPv6, we show that
such tunnels result from the use of 6PE. This is not really surprising
since this mechanism was speciﬁcally designed to forward IPv6 traﬃc
using MPLS tunnels through networks that are not fully IPv6 compliant.
However, we show that it does not result from non dual-stack routers
but rather from the absence of native IPv6 MPLS signaling protocols.
Finally, we investigate a large Tier-1 network, Cogent, that stands out
with an original set-up.

1 Introduction
During the last years, IPv6 has drawn the attention of the research community.
For instance, Dhamdere et al. [1] showed that IPv6 is diﬀerently deployed over
the world (IPv6 is more present in Europe than in the USA), while the routing
dynamics and the path performance are largely identical between IPv4 and IPv6.
More recently, Czyz et al. [2] showed that IPv6 networks are becoming mature

and entering now a production mode. Further, on September, 24th, 2015, the
ARIN IPv4 free pool reached zero, eﬀectively triggering full IPv4 depletion. The
ARIN is now unable to provide any IPv4 block except for those requiring a small
block in order to ease the IPv6 transition [3]. We believe this should accelerate
the global IPv6 adoption.
In parallel to this IPv6 interest, MPLS has been more and more investigated
by the research community. For instance, Sommers et al. [4] examined the char-
acteristics of MPLS deployments that are explicitly identiﬁed using RFC4950
extensions. Donnet et al. [5] provided algorithms for detecting MPLS tunnels
depending on the way MPLS routers react to the ttl-propagate and RFC4950
options. Others looked at the MPLS usage. Pathak et al. [6] quantiﬁed the addi-
tional delay caused by MPLS when used for traﬃc engineering (TE) reasons.
More recently, Vanaubel et al. [7] evaluated the MPLS usage in the light of tran-
sit path diversity, showing that the basic usage for scalability purpose (e.g., with
LDP) seems predominant, with or without path diversity and that TE is well
represented in a subset of speciﬁc ASes. None of those works investigated MPLS
under IPv6.
As the deployment of IPv6 is growing and the interest in MPLS is stronger,
we aim, in this paper, to investigate the state of MPLS deployment under IPv6.
In particular, we are interested in knowing how operators are using MPLS in
IPv6 and whether this usage diﬀers from the one in IPv4. To achieve this goal,
we rely on an IPv6 traceroute dataset collected by CAIDA between 2009 and
2015. From this dataset, we extract tunnels [5] and show that, in parallel to
an increase in the IPv6 deployment, there is, along the time, an increase in the
MPLS usage in IPv6. This usage, as we show it latter in the paper, is essentially
oriented for 6PE purpose (i.e., either for connecting IPv6 islands together or
using LDP for IPv4 to build tunnels carrying both IPv6 and IPv4 traﬃc on dual
stack MPLS routers). We also investigate the particular case of Cogent, a large
Tier-1 ISP having both a very prominent position in the dataset and a very
particular behavior in regards to 6PE.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides the
required background for this paper. Section 3 presents our ﬁndings. Finally,
Sect. 4 concludes this paper by summarizing its main achievements.
2 Background
2.1 MPLS Overview
The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [8] was originally designed to speed
up the forwarding process. In practice, this was done with one or more 32 bits
label stack entries (LSE) inserted between the frame header (Data-link layer)
and the IP packet (Network layer). A given packet may carry out several LSEs
at the same time. In this case, the packet is said having a stack of labels. Each
LSE is made of four ﬁelds: a 20-bit label value used for forwarding the packet to
the next router, a 3-bit Traﬃc Class ﬁeld for quality of service (QoS), priority,
and Explicit Congestion Notiﬁcation (ECN) [9], a 1-bit bottom of stack ﬂag

routers.
(when set the current label is the last in the stack [10]), and an 8-bit time-to-live
(LSE-TTL) ﬁeld having the same purpose as the IP-TTL ﬁeld [11].
MPLS routers, called Label Switching Routers (LSRs), exchange labelled
packets over Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The ﬁrst MPLS router (Ingress Label
Edge Router, or Ingress LER, i.e., the tunnel entry point) adds the label stack,
while the last MPLS router (Egress Label Edge Router, or Egress LER, i.e., the
tunnel exit point) removes the label stack. In some cases, and in particular with
Cisco routers, the LSE stack may be removed by the penultimate MPLS router
(penultimate hop popping, PHP) to reduce the MPLS overhead. The Egress LER
then performs a classic IP lookup and forwards the traﬃc, reducing so the load
on the Egress LER (especially if the Egress LER is shared among several LSPs).
This means that, when using PHP, technically speaking, the MPLS tunnel exit
is one hop before the Egress LER. In its most basic operation, LSPs are con-
structed along best eﬀort routes using the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP [12]).
More speciﬁc LSPs may be constructed for Traﬃc Engineering purposes, using
an extension of the RSVP protocol, RSVP-TE [13]. In these two cases, the label
stack contains only one LSE. A more complex usage is for Virtual Private Net-
works (VPN [14]), where LSPs are constructed using either LDP or RSVP-TE,
and an additional LSE at the bottom of the label stack is used to specify a
Virtual Routing Table at the Egress. In this case, the bottom of the stack is
constant along an LSP, while the top of the stack is modiﬁed at each hop, as in
the previous cases.
2.2 MPLS in IPv6
MPLS can be used in IPv6-only networks in the same way as it is used in IPv4
networks (see George and Pignatoro [15] for a discussion on gaps remaining
between IPv4 and IPv6). Indeed most routing protocols and label distribution
protocols [16,17] have now their IPv6 version. However this has not always been
the case. Moreover, providers do not activate IPv6 capabilities even when they
are available in their hardware and software. Therefore, speciﬁc mechanisms have
been devised to deliver IPv6 traﬃc across networks where there is either no IPv6
routing (IPv4 only networks) or where some mechanisms are not IPv6-aware such
as LDP [12,16].

Y. Vanaubel et al.
Thus, one of the MPLS usage under IPv6 is to connect IPv6 islands through
an IPv4 core network that is unaware of IPv6. This mechanism is called 6PE [18]
and is illustrated in Fig. 1. This is done through the usage of Provider Edge
(PE) routers that are dual-stack and that are located at the edge of the IPv4
domain. Each PE router receives IPv6 preﬁxes from the Customer Edge (CE)
router in the IPv6 domain. IPv6 reachability is exchanged between 6PEs via
multiprotocol-iBGP, MP-BGP.
When 6PE was released, the main objective was to ensure IPv6 connectivity
on top of MPLS core routers that are not IPv6-aware. That situation drove the
need for two labels in the data plane (due to the potential usage of PHP in
particular): (i), the top label is the transport label, which is assigned hop-by-
hop [12,13] and, (ii), the bottom label is a label assigned by BGP and advertised
by iBGP between the PE routers. Quoting RFC4798 [18], “This label advertised
by the egress 6PE Router with MP-BGP MAY be an arbitrary label value, which
identiﬁes an IPv6 routing context or outgoing interface to send the packet to, or
MAY be the IPv6 Explicit Null Label”. This last label has a value of 2 [10].
In that context, the PE routers that perform 6PE are the Ingress and Egress
LERs. Note that today, now that global IPv6 deployment is more common, 6PE
is also interesting for core LSRs with dual-stack routers and IPv6 connectivity.
This is useful to build LSP for IPv6 without using an IPv6 label distribution
protocol (LDP for IPv6 [16] has been ﬁnalized only recently), and/or for sharing
the same LSP for IPv4 and IPv6 traﬃc, reducing so the control plane churn. Our
analysis will show that this speciﬁc behavior is the most common in practice.
2.3 Revealing MPLS Tunnels
MPLS routers may send ICMP time-exceeded messages when the LSE-TTL
expires (in both IPv4 and IPv6). In order to debug networks where MPLS is
deployed, routers may also implement RFC4950 [19], an extension to ICMP
allowing a router to embed an MPLS LSE in an ICMP time-exceeded message.
In that case, the router simply quotes the MPLS LSE (or the LSE stack) of the
received packet in the ICMP time-exceeded message. RFC4950 is particularly
useful for operators as it allows them to verify the correctness of their MPLS
tunnels and TE policy.
If the Ingress LER copies the IP-TTL value to the LSE-TTL ﬁeld rather
than setting the LSE-TTL to an arbitrary value such as 255, LSRs along the
LSP will reveal themselves when using traceroute via ICMP messages even if
they do not implement RFC4950. Operators can conﬁgure this action using the
ttl-propagate option provided by the router manufacturer [11] (while, to the
best of our knowledge, the RFC4950 is just a matter of implementation and
cannot be deactivated on recent routers supporting it). These mechanisms are
identical for IPv4 and IPv6.
In this paper we focus on explicit MPLS tunnels, i.e., tunnels that can be
fully revealed via traceroute as they implement both TTL propagation (they
are seen in traces) and RFC4950 (they are seen as LSRs providing their LSE).
Note that in the case of 6PE, if the TTL of a traceroute packet expires inside
