User: How to monitor and tune the performance of Linux server?
Assistant: 1. Monitoring tools Performance monitoring tools can help administrators identify and deal with server bottlenecks. Common monitoring tools include: - top: displays processes and their system resource usage, such as CPU, memory, and I/O. - vmstat: Provides real-time system status and performance reports, such as CPU utilization, memory usage, etc. - iostat: Provide information such as the I/O load of each hard disk. - sar: Provides historical system performance data. - netstat: Provides network connection information and network traffic statistics, etc. - tcpdump: Capture network packets and analyze their content. - top/htop/atop: Provide more detailed process information and resource usage data. 2. Tuning strategy Linux server tuning involves many aspects, the following are some common tuning strategies: - Memory optimization: reasonably set SWAP partition, increase physical memory, adjust memory usage strategy, etc. - CPU optimization: Adjust CPU frequency, optimize process scheduling strategy, use multi-core CPU, etc. - Hard disk optimization: Use RAID arrays on busy servers, use SSD hard disks, regularly clean up useless files, etc. - Network optimization: optimize DNS cache, adjust packet size, enable network traffic control, etc. - Service tuning: enable caching, enable data compression, use asynchronous I/O, etc. - Database maintenance: optimize query statements, add indexes, backup and optimize database, etc. Admins are advised to monitor and tune the server in several ways for optimal performance and stability.
