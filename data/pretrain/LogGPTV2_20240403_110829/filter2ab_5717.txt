### Title: Domain Borrowing: Catch My C2 Traffic if You Can

For red teams, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) serve as effective redirectors and protectors for Command and Control (C2) traffic, particularly when employing domain fronting. However, if the network includes HTTPS decryption devices, domain fronting can be easily detected by comparing the Server Name Indication (SNI) and the HOST header.

In this talk, we will introduce a novel method to conceal C2 traffic using CDNs, thereby circumventing censorship. We will delve into specific techniques discovered in various CDN implementations and explain how these techniques can be combined to "borrow" a domain and its valid HTTPS certificate. This method, which we call "Domain Borrowing," is especially useful when the SNI and HOST of the C2 traffic are identical.

Additionally, we will demonstrate a detection bypass against Palo Alto's PAN-OS and release a Proof of Concept (PoC) C2 agent to assist in your red team operations.
