Question: You are tasked with creating a device-specific SELinux policy for a new Android device. After putting the device in permissive mode and addressing the majority of denials, you must transition to enforcing mode to ensure security and functionality. Which of the following approaches would be the most appropriate in this context?
"A": "Start in permissive mode, address the denials by core services with proper file labeling, and switch to enforcing mode as early as possible.",
"B": "Begin with enforcing mode immediately to reveal the denials, and then address them by creating a general policy allowing all services access to necessary files.",
"C": "Use permissive mode throughout the device bring-up process to avoid any interruptions and address the denials only after all other tasks are completed.",
"D": "Ignore the core services denials initially, and focus on labeling new services and addressing their denials before considering the transition to enforcing mode."
Answer: A
