Question: In the process of developing SELinux policies for an Android device, you set the kernel_cmdline parameter to 'androidboot.selinux=permissive' for initial policy development. What is the impact of this action and what subsequent steps should be taken before the device can be considered secure and compliant?
"A": "The device will be more secure because all SELinux policies are enforced in permissive mode.",
"B": "The parameter allows policies to be logged but not enforced, which aids in debugging, but it should be removed before shipping to enforce policies and pass CTS.",
"C": "Setting the parameter has no impact on SELinux policy enforcement as it is only a development tool.",
"D": "The device will fail CTS because setting the parameter permanently disables SELinux enforcement."
Answer: B
