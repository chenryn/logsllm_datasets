I'm running `Python 3.5.2` and `numpy 1.15.0`
I'm seeing:
    /usr/lib/python3.5/importlib/_bootstrap.py:222: RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96, got 88
      return f(*args, **kwds)
    /usr/lib/python3.5/importlib/_bootstrap.py:222: RuntimeWarning: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. Expected 96, got 88
      return f(*args, **kwds)
According to this stackoverflow question I shouldn't see this warring as it
was silence since `numpy 1.8`
Why do I see it? and does it means anything?
