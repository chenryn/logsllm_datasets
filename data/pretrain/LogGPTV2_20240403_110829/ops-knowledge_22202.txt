User: I know Twisted is a framework that allows you to do asynchronous non-blocking i/o but I still do not understand how that is different from what Apache server does. If anyone could explain the need for twisted, I would appreciate it..
Assistant: Twisted is a platform for developing internet applications, for handling the underlying communications and such. It doesn't "do" anything out of the box--you've got to program it.
Apache is an internet application, of sorts. Upon install, you have a working web server which can serve up static and dynamic web pages. Beyond that, it can be extended to do more than that, if you wish.
