ABSTRACT
Ethereum relies on a peer-to-peer overlay network to propagate
information. The knowledge of Ethereum network topology holds
the key to understanding Ethereum’s security, availability, and user
anonymity. However, an Ethereum network’s topology is stored in
individual nodes’ internal routing tables, measuring which poses
challenges and remains an open research problem in the existing
literature.
This paper presents TopoShot, a new method uniquely repur-
posing Ethereum’s transaction replacement/eviction policies for
topology measurement. TopoShot can be configured to support
Geth, Parity and other major Ethereum clients. As validated on
local nodes, TopoShot achieves 100% measurement precision and
high recall (88% ∼ 97%). To efficiently measure the large Ethereum
networks in the wild, we propose a non-trivial schedule to run
pair-wise measurements in parallel. To enable ethical measurement
on Ethereum mainnet, we propose workload-adaptive configura-
tions of TopoShot to minimize the service interruption to target
nodes/network.
We systematically measure a variety of Ethereum networks and
obtain new knowledge including the full-network topology in ma-
jor testnets (Ropsten, Rinkeby and Goerli) and critical sub-network
topology in the mainnet. The results on testnets show interest-
ing graph-theoretic properties, such as all testnets exhibit graph
modularity significantly lower than random graphs, implying re-
silience to network partitions. The mainnet results show biased
neighbor selection strategies adopted by critical Ethereum services
such as mining pools and transaction relays, implying a degree of
centralization in real Ethereum networks.

1 INTRODUCTION
A blockchain system relies on an underlying peer-to-peer (P2P)
network to propagate information including recent transactions
and blocks. The topology of the P2P network is foundational to
the blockchain’s availability under network partitions, its security
against a variety of attacks (e.g., eclipsing targeted nodes [29],
denial of specific node service [34, 35], and deanonymization of
transaction senders [20, 33]), and its performance (e.g., mining
power utilization [27] and the quality of RPC services [4, 7, 14]).
Details are in § 3. This value has motivated a line of measurement
studies on the network topology of popular blockchains including
Bitcoin [24, 28] and Monero [22]. However, although Ethereum
is the second largest blockchain network (after Bitcoin) and the
biggest smart-contract platform, measuring Ethereum’s network
topology remains an open research problem. The existing Ethereum
measurement studies [31, 32] focus on profiling individual peer
nodes, but not the connections among them.
Research goals: Specifically, the operational Ethereum P2P net-
work today runs tens of thousands nodes and host multiple overlays:
1) an underlying P2P overlay, called platform overlay, which forms
a structured DHT network by following Kademlia’s protocols [36]
for peer discovery (RLPx) and session establishment (DevP2P) [32],
and 2) a number of application-specific overlays [11, 32], among
which the dominant ones are Ethereum blockchains for information
propagation. In particular, the Ethereum P2P network hosts multi-
ple blockchain overlays with different “networkIDs” including the
mainnet and various testnets, such as Ropsten [16], Rinkeby [15]

Measurement methods: In this work, we propose TopoShot
to measure an Ethereum blockchain overlay by repurposing
Ethereum’s transaction replacement and eviction policies. Briefly,
an Ethereum node buffers unconfirmed transactions (prior to min-
ing) in a local data structure named mempool, where an unconfirmed
transaction can be replaced or evicted by a subsequent transaction at
a sufficiently higher Gas price.2 Transaction replacement and evic-
tion are standard Ethereum features, widely supported by Ethereum
clients (including Geth [8], Parity [13] and others [1, 10, 12]), and
highly desirable by real-world applications. For instance, a com-
mon practice in blockchain-based decentralized applications is that
a user having sent a transaction can posthumously speed up its
inclusion into the blockchain by sending replacement transactions
at higher price per computation unit (or the so-called Gas price).
Leveraging these features, TopoShot runs a measurement node M
to detect the connection between two remote nodes A and B. In
TopoShot, node M propagates a high-priced transaction txA on
target node A, a low-priced transaction txB to target node B, and
a medium-priced transaction txC propagated to all other nodes in
the same network. It then observes txA’s presence on node B and, if
so, draws the conclusion that node A is actively connected to node
B. To ensure the accurate measurement, when node A is not linked
to node B, measurement transaction txA should not be propagated
and do not reach node B (the so-called “isolation” property [24]).
One of the key insights in this work is that Ethereum’s transaction
replacement policy can be repurposed to enforce isolation property
for accurate link measurement. Intuitively, the isolation is ensured
by the fact that TopoShot’s high-priced txA can replace the low-
priced txB on node B but not the medium-priced txC on other
nodes, through which txA cannot be propagated to reach node B.
To set up the measurement as above, TopoShot further leverages
Ethereum’s support of transaction eviction and future transactions,
that is, to evict an existing unconfirmed transaction on a node by
incoming future transactions (the concept of future transaction in
Ethereum is similar to orphan transactions in Bitcoin). Specifically,
when using TopoShot to measure the connectivity between Nodes
A and B, the measurement node M first needs to connect to both
nodes, propagates txC to all nodes, then sends future transactions
to evict txC (with other existing transactions) on node A and B
before sending txA and txB to node A and B, respectively. This
method can be applied to measuring the connectivity among all
possible pairs of nodes by the standard approach of launching a
“supernode” connecting to all other nodes in the network [31, 32].
The basic TopoShot achieves 100% result precision but not 100%
recall, which can be attributed to non-default settings of target
node. We further propose a pre-processing phase retrofittable with
TopoShot to profile the actual settings of target node and to im-
prove the result recall, proactively.
For large-scale measurement on real Ethereum networks, we
propose a non-trivial method to parallelize multiple pair-wise mea-
surements, reducing the rounds and overall time of measurement.
Measurement results: We systematically evaluate the validity of
TopoShot and conduct measurement studies on both testnets and
2The difference between transaction replacement and eviction is that a transaction tx
is replaced by another transaction from the same sender account with tx, and tx is
evicted by another transaction from a different sender from tx when the mempool is
full.

and Goerli [9]. This multi-layer view of Ethereum’s P2P network is
depicted in Figure 1. In the P2P network, each Ethereum node main-
tains “peer” connections at these two layers: 1) On the blockchain
overlay, a node maintains a list of active neighbors through which
local information is propagated. 2) On the platform overlay, a node
stores the inactive neighbors in a DHT routing table, from which
live nodes are promoted to active neighbors in the future.
This work aims at measuring the Ethereum P2P network’s
blockchain overlay and its active links.1 In practice, it is the
blockchain overlay’s active links, instead of platform overlay’s
inactive ones, that capture the exact flow of information propaga-
tion and are more informative. For instance, a node running the
Geth client [8] (which is the most popular Ethereum client and is
deployed on more than 80% nodes in the mainnet [6]) maintains
272 inactive neighbors and around 50 active neighbors, by default.
Knowing what these 50 neighbors are is helpful to understand the
node’s resilience to eclipse attacks (as information is propagated
through the 50 active neighbors, not the 272 inactive ones, and
an attacker only needs to disable the 50 active neighbors to block
information propagation). Also, knowing whether the 50 neighbors
contain nodes from top mining pools, such as Sparkpool [17] (or
popular transaction relay service, such as infura.io [4]), is useful to
estimate the timeliness and quality of the blocks (or transactions)
received on the node, as well as understanding the centralization
of the blockchain network.
Measuring Ethereum network’s active links is an open research
problem. In the existing literature, 1) the related works that measure
Ethereum networks focus on profiling individual nodes [31, 32]
or detecting inactive links [26, 41], but not the active connections.
Compared to the inactive links that are exposed in Ethereum peer
discovery messages (i.e., RLPx’s FIND_NODE packets) and can be
directly measured as in [26, 41], active links are hidden information
inside remote Ethereum nodes, directly measuring which without
inference is impossible as we thoroughly examine Ethereum pro-
tocol’s messages. 2) The other related works explore the topology
of non-Ethereum blockchains including Bitcoin [24, 28] and Mon-
ero [22]. Their measurement approaches exploit features specific
to Bitcoin/Monero and are inapplicable to Ethereum as will be de-
tailed in § 4. Notably, TxProbe’s approach [24] to infer Bitcoin’s
topology cannot be applied to measuring Ethereum topology, as
these two blockchains differ in transaction model (account-based
versus UTXO-based) and propagation model (direct propagation
versus announcement), as will be further explained in § 4.1.

the mainnet. The measurement results uncover, for the first time,
the full network topology of Ethereum’s major testnets (including
Ropsten, Rinkeby and Goerli) and the inter- and intra-connections
among the mainnet’s mining-pools and transaction relay services.
First, we validate the TopoShot’s correctness in terms of recall
and precision. We set up a local node under control and a remote
node in a testnet, and we use TopoShot to measure the connection
between the two nodes. By comparing against the ground-truth of
node connection (via querying the local node’s state), we confirm
that TopoShot achieves the perfect precision (100%) and a high
recall (up to 97%).
Second, we use TopoShot to measure, for the first time, the
network topology of major Ethereum testnets including Ropsten,
Goerli and Rinkeby. We also analyze the captured graphs which re-
veal a number of graph-theoretical properties including degree dis-
tribution, distances, assortativity, clustering and community struc-
tures. Our comparative analysis shows that the measured Ethereum
networks have particularly lower modularity than classic random
graphs [19, 25, 40], implying a better resilience against attacks to
partition the networks.
Third, we propose enhanced TopoShot configurations to allow
lightweight yet effective measurement on the mainnet without eth-
ical concerns. The TopoShot enhancement minimizes the impacts
on the target nodes being measured, and particularly ensures that
the set of transactions included in the blockchain do not change
under measurement. Using the approach, we measure a critical
substructure of Ethereum’s mainnet overlay. The result reveals bi-
ased neighbor selection strategy commonly practiced by critical
Ethereum services such as mining pools and transaction relays who
prioritize to connect other critical nodes over average nodes. We
acknowledge the high cost of our method and avoid measuring the
topology of entire mainnet network which would otherwise cost
60 million USD at the Ether price as of May 2021.
Contributions: This work makes the following contributions:
• Novel methods: We propose a novel method, named TopoShot, to
measure Ethereum network links and topology. TopoShot takes a
unique approach by exploiting Ethereum’s handling of unconfirmed
transactions (i.e., transaction replacement and eviction). TopoShot
is generic and supports all Ethereum clients (including Geth and
Parity). TopoShot is effective and achieves 100% result precision
and high recall (88% ∼ 97%).
• Large-scale measurements: We address the scalability and ethical
challenges raised in measuring large-scale, real Ethereum networks.
We propose to schedule pair-wise measurements in parallel for
efficiency. We propose workload-adaptive mechanisms to configure
TopoShot for minimal service interruption on the target nodes/net-
work.
• New systematic results: Without TopoShot, an Ethereum net-
work’s topology remains hidden information inside blackbox
Ethereum nodes, measuring which stays an open research prob-
lem. By systematically conducting measurements against a variety
of Ethereum networks, we obtain a series of new knowledge on
network topology and its graph-theoretic statistics, ranging from
full-network topology in popular testnets (Ropsten, Rinkeby and
Goerli) and critical sub-network topology in the mainnet.

sented in § 3. § 4 surveys the related works and their (in)applicability
to measuring Ethereum’s topology. § 5 presents TopoShot’s mea-
surement primitive, parallel schedule, as well as correctness analy-

the mainnet. The ethical aspects of this work are discussed in § 7,
and the conclusion is in § 8.
2 PRELIMINARY
Ethereum transactions: To begin with, we describe the transac-
tion model used in Ethereum. An Ethereum transaction binds a
sender account to a receiver account. Each transaction is associ-
ated with a nonce, which is a monotonically increasing counter per
sender. An Ethereum transaction is associated with Gas price, that
is, the amount of Ether the sender is willing to pay to the miner for
each unit of computation carried out by the miner to validate the
transaction.
Unconfirmed transaction buffer (mempool): Each Ethereum
node stores unconfirmed transactions in a local data structure,
named mempool. In a mempool, a transaction tx is pending, if its
nonce equals one plus the maximal nonce of the transactions of the
same sender in the mempool (i.e., equal to n + 1). Otherwise, if tx’s
nonce is strictly larger than n + 1, tx is a future transaction.
When a transaction tx propagated from other nodes arrives at a
node N , node N determines whether to admit tx into its mempool.
Admitting a transaction tx may trigger two more mempool events:
1a) eviction of an existing transaction tx′ by tx where tx and tx′ are
of different accounts or nonces, and 1b) replacement of an existing
transaction tx′ by tx where tx and tx′ are of the same sender and
nonce.
Transaction propagation: When admitting a pending transac-
tion to its mempool, an Ethereum node propagates the transaction
to its active neighbors. If an incoming transaction is not admitted
or the admitted transaction is a future transaction, it will not be
propagated.
Normally, an Ethereum node directly pushes a pending transac-
tion to its neighbors. That is, it sends a message to its neighbors
