#### Issue Description
The first checkbox's label, "Loving", drops down to a new line. To me, it
looks odd and appears as though the assignment is incorrect or that something
is wrong with the student's code.
A student may hack this by removing the leading space before "Loving", but
then it won't visually match the other two checkbox labels, both of which have
spaces to separate them from the actual checkbox itelf.
Perhaps shortening the actual word from "Loving" to "Kind" or "Calm" would be
an easy fix?
