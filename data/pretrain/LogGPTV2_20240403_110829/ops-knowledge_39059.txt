User: 请解答这个和日志有关的问题Windows Server: Change AD account name In my SBS 08 (AD, exchange), is it possible to change the name, email address of a user because he is leaving and I'd like to transfer all the account and credential to the new employee that is replacing him.

Lot's of thing are set up for this user and it would save me lots of time if I can transfer an account like this.

Thanks for your help !

Assistant: I was also taught the best practice is to copy and not rename as Zypher stated, for a few reasons.

1) When renaming, the new person logs into their pc they will be using the old users profile, which can cause confusing. 

2) Also, if you use user folders on the server which most people do and should, they will be using the old users folder on the server, which again, can cause confusion in the future.

It's best to copy the user account, and create new or rename the users folder on the server, then fix rights of course.
